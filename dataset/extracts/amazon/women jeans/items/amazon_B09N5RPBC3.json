                "reviewText": "Update to review below: I\u2019ve worn these to work twice. Honestly, they are pretty uncomfortable. They feel great when standing but feel uncomfortable while sitting. They are not too small. I may only wear these if going somewhere for a few hours but not all day. Sad. The pair I have is thick and only has 1% stretch. I guess we can\u2019t have it all. :)I am on a constant hunt for the \"perfect\" jeans. I may have found them. This review is for the Jive Sound wash. (I also tried the Love in the Mist and Oxford Haze wash in the same style and returned those due to the fabric. Love in the Mist was too thin and stretchy. Oxford Haze didn't have any stretch at all and were very uncomfortable.) These jeans fit like a glove. I usually wear a 28 or 29 and bought these in a 29. If you are in between sizes, size up. I'm slightly curvy. If you are very curvy or very straight, they may not fit you as well. I love the fabric. Thick, perfect medium wash, only 1% stretch. I love the shape of the leg. Not too wide, not too skinny. I'm 5'7\" and I like the length. Ankle length on me. I'm not sure if I've ever had a pair of jeans fit so well. And I do think they flatter the tush. I'm usually a bit self-conscious about my backside, but I think I'll flaunt it in these jeans. I'll update my review after wearing them for a while and after washing, if they don't hold up as well, stretch out, or shrink or something.",

                "reviewText": "I tried these jeans after they were named best straight leg jeans in the New York Times Wirecutter product reviews. I love them for easy, day-to-day jeans. I had to size down for the right fit. My natural waist is 29, and, at first, I thought that size on the jeans was perfect. But the pair stretched out more than I\u2019d hoped. They\u2019re still wearable for a relaxed, looser fit, but I wanted to maintain more structure around the seat of the paints. The 28s were very tight to get on. I didn\u2019t think I could button them up! After I squeezed them on and wore them ones, they loosened up and are now very comfortable to wear.",
