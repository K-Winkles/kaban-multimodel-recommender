They fit well; i'm about 5'4\" and about 110lbs and the Mfits me perfectly. Someone mentioned they are too 'thin'. I do not find that. I think they are perfect for thesummer--i would not wear capris in the winter anyway. The material & thickness is fine. One thing though: unwrapping them, they had a strange smell. I never wear things w/o washing themfirst, so i popped them into the washer, w/some other clothes, a little detergent, fabric softener, turned them inside out, etc., and they were fine. HUE makes a good product.Very comfortable.",

First, I would have liked these to be just a bit longer, maybe an inch or so. Second, I wish they didn\u2019t have belt loops and a button to poke through my top. I would have preferred a perfectly smooth front. Update: Since reviewing these, I have found another pair of white denim capris that don\u2019t have the belt loops and the button in the front, so now I\u2019ll be returning these.",
