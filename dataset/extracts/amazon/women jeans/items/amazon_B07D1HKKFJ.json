I generally don\u2019t buy any jeans without trying them on but since I have been wearing them quite awhile I took a chance and ordered these in the same size as my capris. They fit perfect and are so soft and comfortable and stretchy but not baggy. You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re wearing jeans. They don\u2019t bind on my stomach and they are the perfect length for my oh so short legs ( I\u2019m only 4ft 11in. 120lbs. I was so pleased with these that a week later I ordered a second pair. I am truly pleased with them they launder well and they just feel so good on. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed if you purchase these. I give them a big thumbs up.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first time ordering from this brand. I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d and 127 lbs. I usually like my jeans a little lengthy so that they bunch at the ankles. I normally buy a 30 inch inseam jean to get that look, but since regulars were 29 inches in this brand, I went with regulars, not long, fearing they might be too long. These come just below my ankle, so I will most likely wear them with booties versus tennis shoes. I will have to see if a pair in long is too long or not.The fit is great, the fabric is soft, and I like the rise on the jeans, as I have a very small belly button to crotch length. I don\u2019t like my jeans to bunch up in the crotch when I sit down, and these do not - yay! The lengths were all consistent between the three pairs. I lined them up by the back of the waistband, and the lengths were exactly the same as you can see in my picture. May need to use a belt with them, as I had a little extra room in the waist \u2014 again that\u2019s my narrow hip issue. The fabric is very soft and comfortable, maybe just a tad thinner than other stretch jeans I have owned.I really love them, so hopefully they hold up during regular washing and use. I am either a women\u2019s 2 or 4 in other brands, depending on my winter/summer weight. I could see going down to a size 3 in these if I lose my usual 7-10 lbs come summer. I love these and overall I am a happy camper!",

But I like my pants comfy so they are my go-to jeans and I just hike them up once in awhile. Lol Comfortable and sturdy! Better looking and just as comfy as sweat pants!",

I will have to return it and order size 7 short. I am 135lbs. But wow..these jeans are amazing, nice stretch and color.The 7 came and it was also too small.I returned the 7 and ordered the 9.The 9 came, fits perfectly around my waist but now the 9 is too big just below my hips as shown in the photos. The 7 fitted me perfectly except my waist. Where as the 9 fits around my waist but big otherwise.It seems the smaller sizes' material are better then the bigger sizes. I find the size 9's material is cheaper then the sise 5 & 7",

Hope the 3rd pair I order will be without defect!",
