As soon as I put these on, I knew I was keeping them. I used to only order Miss Me jeans, but I got mad when the last couple of pairs ripped on me with very light wear at a job where I sat at a desk all day. These pants feel like good quality pants, they are super cute and the sizing was perfect. The color is true to the picture, which is a huge problem with ordering pants online. We will see how these hold up through a few washes, but so far, I love them. I will definitely be ordering more of this brand.",

Perfect fit at the waist and they make my butt look great too! Cuffed like in the picture is a perfect ankle length on me, but for you taller ladies they are just cuffed; you can totally unroll them if you need/want more length. I just bought a second pair in another color. LOVE LOVE LOVE",
