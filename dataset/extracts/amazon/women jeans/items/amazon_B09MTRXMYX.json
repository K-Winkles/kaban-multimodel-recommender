                "reviewText": "About as close to perfection as possible (especially given my wonky body shape)!I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d-5\u20194\u201d (right smack on the line between regular and petite). My weight fluctuates a lot, but currently around 175-185. As pants are concerned, I\u2019m middle heavy, but with a hourglass shape overall (technically speaking). However, my legs are disproportionately thin. This all obviously makes pants shopping really difficult. Stretchiness is my friend!After exchanging a size 15, I landed on a size 13, two sizes smaller than the size 17 as recommended by Amazon, and one size smaller than the 15 I\u2019d normally wear in juniors\u2019 sizes, (12-14 in ladies) so when you read they run big, believe it.To my delight, the 13 fits as well as I can expect (they\u2019re a bit more snug in the waist than I\u2019d prefer, but I\u2019m on the heavier side of my ever-fluctuating weight, so it won\u2019t be long before they\u2019re perfect- and until then they do a good job of keeping my bellyunder control).Length-wise, in the full length Wallflower \u201cluscious curvy\u201d fit flare jeans, I have to get short length, or have them hemmed, as they\u2019re way too long on me. But the great thing about these are that they are the perfect length w/one cuff (as worn by the models) to wear as cropped-style, and with a couple cuffs become super cute capris!But the crowning jewel (yes, a shameless pun) has to be the rhinestone embellishments! I will bedazzle ANYTHING, but you don\u2019t have to be obsessed with sparkles to appreciate these pants. They\u2019re beautiful, but not over the top. You can dress them up for a night out, or down for a casual summer barbecue.Lastly, I\u2019m on a really tight budget, so I had two concerns: first being which style to buy (bc I\u2019d have bought them all if I could)- after much thought and difficulty finding a similar design to \u2018Clarke\u2019 on any full length styles (as I could the others) I decided on them. Second, I saw they were available for just $15 as \u201cUsed: Like New\u201d with the description of \u2018Condition consistent with having been tried on but not worn.\u2019\u201d Given that they were being sold & shipped by Amazon, I had enough faith to give them a try and return them if necessary but they\u2019re indistinguishable from being brand new! They were already a great deal at full price, but if you see your size in the \u201ctried on\u201d condition, go for it- I sure am glad I did!-Colleen Jane",
