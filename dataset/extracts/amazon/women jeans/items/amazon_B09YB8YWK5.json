Even when I opened the package and laid them out to look over I immediately knew the calf was gonna be an issue. I dont know who the origional pattern maker was but they just didn't think it through. Levi's hasn't come around yet to the curvier womens bodies, ones with smaller waists and larger hips and more of a defined hourglass figure and have stuck with the straight patterns. All said, I like the jeans and I feel they are a good value just be sure to order a size or two up and you should be fine.",

                "reviewText": "3 stars for a few reasons:Pros;Nice color, fit in legs well.Waistband is elastic so it lies smoothly.Slits in the leg opening are flattering and don't create a squeezed calf look.Cons:It is a bit too stretchy in the waistband and gaps in the back, so I'll need to size down despite my measurements matching this particular size.I got sent an obviously worn pair. By that I mean, it was worn and returned, not just tried on. It was very wrinkly out of the package, not the usual folded and pressed lines. The sizing sticker, tag, and waistband label were all removed and placed in the pocket of the jeans (sticker was even crumpled) , then folded in the package in a way that made that not visible. So now, having opened it to try them on (and will need to return), it looks like *I* did that. Hopefully someone else did not jeopardize my return, and I hope my size down order doesn't have the same thing.",

And they're incredibly comfortable - and I'm someone who normally finds jeans terribly uncomfortable.",
