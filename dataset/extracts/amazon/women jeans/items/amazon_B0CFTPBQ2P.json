There are options to suit every body type - whether you're tall, petite or plus size. Next, consider which rise you prefer: mid-rise jeans sit just above the hips, while high-rise designs come up to your belly button. Try skinny-fit styles if you prefer a streamlined look, or go for a looser pair if comfort is at the top of your priorities list. Mom jeans are ideal for creating a vintage vibe, while flares can help to balance proportions.",

If you have a slim or skinny body type, ripped jeans would be a great choice. For a casual event like a barbecue or party, ripped jeans would also be a good choice. If you have a curvy body type, distressed jeans might be a better option because they can make you look wider than you are.

                "reviewText": "I am always hesitant to purchase pants or jeans online, but I took a chance because these jeans looked so cute! I sized down because they have a bit of stretch. As soon as I received them I tried them on and they were perfect! They hugged in all the right spots, so much better than most jeans I have tried on in stores.",

They are high waisted, and all buttons, stretchy, and they are flattering around our hips in our thighs. I am 55, so there are a tiny bit long for me, but they look great with a pair of vans, or a pair of high heels either way, I will absolutely buy these again. True to size, color all of it, and for a very reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "I hate to complain about my pants having pockets too big. I mean, we have fought fashion for usable pockets for decades, right? But the pockets on these require a certain amount of care when you\u2019re putting the jeans on to get them laying right and they are almost too deep.Other than that, these are your typical cheap blue jeans. The zipper is super cheap. The fabric isn\u2019t thick enough to be helpful at shaping. Like literally no butt lift at all and they give visible panty line. They fit as expected and look fine on. I have thick ankles and some skinny jeans cut off my circulation, but these are comfortable. I am 5\u20195\u201d 160lbs and ordered a size 12. They fit as expected.",

                "reviewText": "I bought 4 pair of these jeans in different washes, but all in the same size. The first pair that arrived fit great at first try on and I liked the stretch. I noticed that the zipper was of cheap quality and kind of catches on itself, but I was willing to overlook that because I thought the fit was good. For the low price and decent fit, I ordered a few more colors in that same size. The next 3 pair that arrived did not fit right at all. Despite being the same size the other pairs ran small. On one pair, the fabric that is supposed to cover the zipper was sewn off a bit so the zipper would always be exposed. I returned other three pair immediately after trying them on and only kept the one. The stitching in the inside of the waist is hard and rubs uncomfortably, especially after a few washes. The pair that I kept that did fit well at first shrank quite a bit after a few washes and they don\u2019t fit well anymore. Would not buy again.",

I\u2019ve lost weight recently, so I\u2019m still exploring my size. These have amazing stretch, and are a little bigger than I expected- but again, I\u2019m not sure what size I truly am. Stay true to size just in case! Buying a few more in a smaller size. These will definitely go on the turkey/pms/travel day/comfy pile to be worn again!",

It\u2019s not a cheapy zipper. It\u2019s not stitched improperly. It\u2019s just one of those sharp, metal zippers (if that makes sense) that\u2019s prone to stick. They elasticity is so good, I can leave them zipped and still get get them on and off. But, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll forget and unzip them and it\u2019ll stick again. I would have given 5 stars if not for that one thing.",
