I could not justify purchasing these, because they look the same as my jeans I already have that I bought for much less. The fabric was thin, and the stitching wasn\u2019t perfect. I will say the back looked good, so the pocket placing was good for those of us who have a bottom. I was sad to see them go for that reason, but they just didn\u2019t look nice enough from the front, and I can\u2019t walk backwards every time I\u2019m in public. Just not gonna happen.",
