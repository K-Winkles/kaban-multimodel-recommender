                "reviewText": "I'd actually return them if I didn't pay the sale price of $18...they are waaaay to short to be considered \"regular\" especially with no option of ordering \"long or tall\" length. They are fine I'll make do...good for wearing a flat sandal or easily tucking into tall/mid length boots in fall or winter. Couldn't wear with a regular pair of sneakers or dress shoes. I think they'd look silly, obviously my personal opinion. I did follow other purchasers advice by ordering a size up...I typically wear a 14 or 16, waist is between 32-33 inches depending on the brand and fit/style of jeans. So I ordered the 34 to be safe, in that aspect they fit perfectly, it's just the length that kinda pisses me off. I'll have to be mindful of the shoes I wear with them.",
