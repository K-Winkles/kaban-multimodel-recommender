I have big calves thanks to genetics and bootcut just don't cut it. These stretch, move with my curves, are comfy both sitting, standing, and walking. I'm writing this review after buying another pair after the first ones finally fell to chub-rub. But I can tell you these puppies went all over Italy and Greece with me and took a beating. Well worth the price!",

They were a good foot too long and I had them hemmed.The other thing is the color choices. I love the light washed, but I'd love to see more colors that are not the boyfriend style.Love love love them!!!",
