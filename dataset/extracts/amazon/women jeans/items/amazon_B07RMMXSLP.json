                "reviewText": "These may be the most flattering jeans I have purchased in years - I'm not kidding.Stop wasting money on over-priced jeans. These are sub $50. I bought the size 4 / long and they fit like a glove (I'm 5\"5 and 130 lbs). I'm short waisted and these jeans hit nicely - not too high not too low. The dark denim is very flattering - super cute with a stacked heel boot and chunky sweater or fitted turtleneck . Dress down with a fun sneaker and t-shirt. Snug fit but with nice stretch. I'm a fan.",

The color is perfectly dark all over. Mature dressy look you can wear with a sweatshirt, dressy casual sweater or a blazer. They length is super perfect. I have such a hard time with that. The bootleg is not super wide, very classy. I bought 2 pairs may go for the 3rd :)",

I have a long torso, short legs and I weigh more than I should right now, which is a recipe for agony when trying to buy jeans or pants, in person and online. Straight from the delivery bag, they looked a bit small, however, they went on perfectly, sat perfectly at mid waist (right about my bellybutton) and the inseam was perfect for me while wearing a 2\" boot. They do stretch, and don't feel too thin. I'd say they are a thicker weight denim. They did not ride low after wearing them for awhile. The color was as pictured and they came earlier than expected. I'm 5'3\" and about 157lbs with a long torso and short legs, if that helps other buyers.",
