Since I just wanted comfortable pants that would look OK with an untucked shirt, I kept them, but if I were to order another pair, I\u2019d go down one size. The photo makes these jeans look like high waters, but their length is fine, hitting at the middle of my heels rather than floating above them. Also, they\u2019re relaxed in the thigh, so they fit my thickish legs just fine.",

I would say they are a little higher than I would like, but I still wear them I little lower and just have more room at the crotch. I have been buying Levi\u2019s for years and they just kept getting skinnier leg, lower waist, bad material, and don\u2019t even get me started about the pockets. I tried the Amazon jeans thinking I can always send them back. I was very pleasantly surprised. Legs are a good \u201crelaxed\u201d width - not too baggy. Fabric is a great weight with just a little stretch to be comfortable, but not enough to feel like you are wearing leggings. Actual pockets! Pockets that you can actually carry your phone in or some cash and not be checking all the time to see if it has fallen out. Price is great. Well worth the $25 or $30 a pair. I bought one pair, then turned around and bought 3 more.",

                "reviewText": "These overall are not bad for the price. The low quality is visible, however. The stitching in the front zipper/crotch area is crooked,. On both pairs of jeans. I got two in different sizes. I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d 128lbs. I got a size 2 and size 4. (Generally wear sizes 27-28 in jeans) Strangely they fit the same on me. I\u2019m returning them only because of the crooked stitching issue, and probably will order another one in hopes that it was a fluke with these two jeans. (The butt could look better but for this price and just jeans to run errands or doing yard work, they\u2019re practical.) Other than that, they fit pretty well and hug the butt and waist and are baggier in the legs with slight taper which I roll up and look like mom jeans on me. In the model pics, they don\u2019t look as high wasted but they are in that \u201cmom jean\u201d way I think at least if you\u2019re average height",

                "reviewText": "I bought size 4. I'm 5'6\", 137lb, thicker in the thighs and smaller in the waist. These jeans were much better than I expected and the color in the picture looks darker than in person. The material is the perfect thickness and offers mild smoothing of bumps and lumps and some stretch for comfort. These were more flattering on my butt than any looser for jean I've tried.",
