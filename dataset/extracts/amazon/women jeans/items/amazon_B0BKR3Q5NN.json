Today they ripped on the inner thigh after traveling and walking all day. They then proceeded to rip further and further every time I lifted my leg up. The material is super poor quality and I would not recommend.",

This pair is a size 8 (I am always able to wear a size 8 in Levi Signature - as they all run big IMO).The waist measure 15.5 inches flat, the inseam is 27 inches (ankle length, if you are taller than 5\u20194 these are gonna be short, almost a perfect length for me at 5\u20193\u201d), 11.5 inch rise, the leg opening is 14 inches.They are a mid-weight cotton blend with plenty of stretch. The rise is long, maybe a little too long, so the crotch hangs a little low if you don\u2019t keep them pulled up. They are a nice slim straight style, that are a pretty classic cut that will likely always be \u201cin-style\u201d They are comfy. I have washed themed and they really didn\u2019t seam to shrink and they have done a decent job of holding their shape throughout the day. Overall a solid pair of not expensive jeans, great for wearing around the house, but definitely don\u2019t do anything to enhance your figure; like you don\u2019t put them on and think \u201cwow, these look great\u201d it is more like \u201cwow, these are a perfectly serviceable pair of jeans\u201d. I mean for $23 you can\u2019t go wrong really.",
