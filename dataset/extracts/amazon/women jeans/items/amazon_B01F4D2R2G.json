                "reviewText": "These jeans run just a tad large for me but I am sort of in between sizes. I bought a size 5. I am 5'5\", 124 pounds, and have about a 28\" waist. I usually wear size 3 or 5 in jeans depending on the stretch and style. These jeans fit well but have just a tad more space in the waist than I am used to. They are not super thick but are also not flimsy. They are long enough for my long legs and the rise is low but not too low. I would guess 7.5\".I bought these jeans on a whim quite a while ago. And now, with so much furor over the confederate flag, I am hesitant to wear them. I don't want to be disrespectful but just liked the colors and the fun style and didn't really think about what the pattern represented. I wore these once with a long navy blue top that covered the top part and just showed the red stripe and the outfit looked great. The jeans didn't bag out or wrinkle and kept their shape. They have a bit of stretch, not a lot, just enough to be comfortable. I like these quite a bit and plan to buy a different style in them and will probably go down a size and hope they aren't too small. In all, well made jeans. Basically true to size.",

I just got them and haven't washed them yet, but when I tried them on they were not comfy, they were itchy and rough. If after washing they feel better, I will definitely update my review and increase stars, but for now, three stars because they are not at all comfy.They fit better than expected. By the size chart, apparently my waist is a size 3 or 5 and my hips are a size 9 or 11, so that caused me some confusion over what size to order. I got a 5 and they actually fit fine in the waist and hip area. They are a bit long, but that can be fixed and I expect that as a short person buying jeans (am 5'3) and they are very tight in the legs (I realize that is kind of the pint, but they are more restricting than expected).The blue black color is pretty dark. From the inside you can see blue in the denim that is barely noticeable from the outside. I have a medium blue pair on order that I was considering cancelling to search for comfier jeans, but I am so thoroughly baffled by all the reviews with very different experiences to mine (very comfy, not skin tight in the legs) that I am going to wait and see if the next pair are better.",

I admit I was leery about buying pants online, but the department stores here wanted too much for too little and I couldn't get the right fit, and I was getting desperate. These arrived in a very timely fashion and I was pleased that they fit with no problem! They are tight enough to provide the aesthetic I was trying to achieve yet stretchy and comfortable enough to perform on-stage for several hours without cutting off circulation! They are also comfortable for daily wear (going to store, errands, etc). They have pretty decent pocket space too!",
