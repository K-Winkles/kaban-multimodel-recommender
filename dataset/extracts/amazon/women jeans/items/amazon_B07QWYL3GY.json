I have however had a very difficult time finding a great boyfriend jean. Well, I don't need to look any further because these are perfect!They are a true mid-rise and the waist is not tighter than the rest of the pant. They fall perfectly without being too tight or too loose and the wash is perfect. I love these jeans! They are so comfortable, I could sleep in them in them if I wanted to.The 29 inch inseam is with the pant cuffed and it is a nice finished hem so you could also roll them down and wear them without the cuff. With the cuff they fall perfectly to my ankle.Will definitely be ordering more!",
