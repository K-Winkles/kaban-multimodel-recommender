I got them to replace my oldee jeans of the same brand that suffered the death of thick thighs. These are snug for the first 30-ish minutes after washing but will stretch after and has enough hold if you are self-conscious about belly fat. They do not overly stretch though. Just the right amount of stretch in these jeans for me. It's hugs around the butt area nicely.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not sure if I managed to find two knockoff pairs of these or the cut has been changed. These were my favorite jeans. I have purchased multiple pairs since 2021. But the latest ones that I ordered do not fit the same, even though I purchased my normal size. I ordered a pair and received the wrong color, plus the fit was off. I reordered a second pair, and I received the wrong color again. The second pair fit a little better, but still not the way older pairs have in the past. It seems that the cut in the waist and thighes have been altered to be larger. I'm worried to go a size smaller (older pairs fit like a glove). I even bought a pair of bootcut and they don't fit the same either. Anyone else run across this issue? This is just disappointing because it's so hard to find a decent pair of jeans anymore.",
