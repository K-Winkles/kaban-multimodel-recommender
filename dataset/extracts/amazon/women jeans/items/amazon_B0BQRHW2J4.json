I looked like Jethro from the Beverly Hillbillies and my husband laughed at me. I'm about 5'9 weigh about 165/ 170. I checked the size chart and measured for fit. Although they're a little on the big side, I would have kept them had they been the correct length. I usually wear a 34 inseam, which is sometimes a bit long on me, so 33 would have been good. So disappointed. I really wanted these to fit. Returning",
