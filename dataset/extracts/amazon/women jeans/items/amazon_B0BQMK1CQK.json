I wear a 12/14 now and ordered a 16 to be safe. They are too big but not in a good way. The pleats in the front poof out. They are not high-rise. They are what we used to call mid-rise. If you're over 45 or postmenopausal, try some without pleats unless you have abs of steel. I do like the fabric and the length is perfect for me (5'5). The bottoms are not tapered enough for me we used to peg them and that's an option. I would keep them if they were high-waisted and I'd wear a belt. They hit in a unflattering part of my middle. If you're thin, you might like them. I'm 30 lbs over weight right now (remote work does not help), but those pleats are too 80s. Looking for some jeans like I had in the 90s.",

That said, these pants are my new favs. I'm gonna try to control myself or at least pace myself, I want every pair. I typically have my pants pressed & altered. These pants look great cuffed up and unpressed. This is not my usual look, but they actually look great. I love 'em!",

I ordered a size 10 instead of my usual 8 and as you can see in the pictures, I could have gotten away with a size 8. Hope the pictures help you making a decision!",

                "reviewText": "Trying to relive your youth through these pants is a bad idea. What was cute in the '80s early '90s it's just not so cute now and the execution on these pants is mediocre at best. There was an acid watch look that appeared cheap. Like you got these jeans from the wrong store at the mall, past the Orange Julius across from sharper image. Not the one you wanted because you couldn't afford the ones you wanted, and had to go to the cheaper store. That really could be the look you're going for I recognize it has a certain appeal, if so you'll probably like the finish on these jeans. These jeans also suffer from that Boyfriend Jean fit fail for anyone with hips and a butt / curvy and by curvy I mean thick but well proportioned. You see a jeanne and think it's going to fit you like it fits a slender person without hips and a butt, the reality is it will not. Sure these pants probably give someone who is more of a straight body type a little bit more of shapely look based on the poofiness. But for the rest of us it just bulges in the wrong place. That slightly awkward fit combined with the cheap looking wash just is not worth it.I really wanted to like them and they at least fit over my butt and hips which is a major accomplishment in jeans world, but ultimately this was not a good purchase. For the price might be worth it for one or two specific outfits and wears, just not exactly the look I was going for. I return them so quickly I forget the sizing but I feel like they were pretty true to size.",

Order your standard size because these jeans are true to size. Jeans are long on my 5ft. frame but, I can roll up bottoms. Good quality for the price. I will keep.",
