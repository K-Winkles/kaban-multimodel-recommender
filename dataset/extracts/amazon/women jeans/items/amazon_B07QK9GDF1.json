                "reviewText": "Fabulous! I'm SO relieved! I NEVER wear skinny jeans because I tend to wear either actual leggings....or bootcut jeans and just never got on the \"jeggings\" and skinny-jean train. However....I wear tons of knee-high boots and although they paid easily with my collection of standard and fleece leggings....they are such a pain to wear with jeans. Always stuffing the legs down into the boots and trying to get it all even. UGH.So finally, I decided to try some jeans that felt and functioned like legging....but were still real jeans. I chose Levi's because ever since my early 20's I find that they may not have tons of frills and bling....but their sizing is right on point for me no matter what the style. These are no different. I actually could have ordered a size smaller, but was unsure of how \"skinny\" would fit me since I don't wear them. I ordered the \"tall\" because normally \"regular\" in ANY pant is too short for me. These are a tiny bit longer than I expected....but fit perfectly from top to bottom. No pulling, bunching, or floppy areas. Most importantly, they didn't get looser as I wore them. They stayed fitted and tight from top to bottom. The color is VERY dark (they were sold out of the other shades and I'd have preferred slightly lighter) but I actually really like how they look and the color is growing on me.I wore them to my family's house and my mother said that I looked like I had \"lost weight\". I don't know if I actually did lose weight or if these pants are incredibly slimming....but that's a bonus for sure! The \"top panel for slimming\" isn't really notable and I'm not sure how much it truly helps any more than a well-fitting higher cut pant of any type....but they are definitely high enough that there's NO tummy bulge or dreaded \"muffin top\". They don't slip down or fold over when you sit. The leg and butt area are super-comfortable and really flattering no matter what your body type and frankly....they've changed my mind about skinny jeans and flexible jeans in general. These are almost as comfortable as my standard, thin, barely-there leggings. And that's stunning to me because they are fully-functional jeans!I really hope they stock more colors because I will be sticking with this style and brand and buying lighter colors for Summer and Spring styles the moment they're in stock. These are cut perfectly for high boots OR for dainty Summer Sandals and you can definitely wear them confidently with sheer Spring styles OR bulky Winter tunics. I absolutely love them so far!*I will add photos and update because I know that can help someone who may have a similar body type as I do, but for now....I'm 5'7 and buy \"tall\" because I'm very long in the thigh area and leggy overall. But I have some pudge around my middle and range from 10 to 12 in fitted jeans/pants mostly because of my belly. My thighs and butt are mostly standard, but these would definitely flatter a curvier butt and thigh. I sized up to a 12 and think next time I'd probably get a 10 instead. So I would NOT buy whatever your \"higher size\" tends to be. They run very true to size and there is plenty of flex to avoid unsightly bulges*. Truly a \"slimming, stays fitted\" jean when finding those in ANY style is so rare. LOVE THEM and totally recommend!!*****UPDATE FEBRUARY 24, 2017*******As you can see, I added photos. I've worn these jeans so many times since posting this original review that I cannot even count. And whether casual or fancy, they have held their form (which is the biggest issue I find with both regular jeans as well as leggings). I've washed them, but not dried them (line-dry only) and they lost no form and continued to stay true especially in the waist, which is the area that I find even the most expensive jeans start to slag, fall, or fold. While it may not always be unflattering to others...it's always uncomfortable when that happens. I've not had that experience with these at all. There is no shrinkage in length (important to me since I'm long in the thick -->crotch area) and no other shrinkage I've noted. These are perfect for a tall-not-tall person like me who has weirdly-long legs....but isn't truly a \"tall\" (I think \"talls\" are 5'8 and above, but I'm 5'7 and cannot wear most \"Regular\" pants). The color also stayed true. And in dark jeans, that's unusual. I washed them in a \"delicates\" bag, but but them on normal Permanent Press and put other stuff in with them. The color didn't bleed and stain my other clothes and they fit just like the first time after line-drying.Again...I sized up on these and would probably dry them in the dryer simply because they were bigger than I needed to begin with. But if you are not planning on heat-drying these (putting them on cool/tumble or line drying) there is no color bleed or shrinkage at all that I can detect. They still stay \"high\" on the waist and don't flop, fall, or fold after multiple wearings and still look good with heavy Winter sweaters or with delicate tops that show the waist on these pants. PLEASE start selling more colors of these for Summer and Spring. If you hate Skinny Jeans, Jeggings, Leggings, or even regular Jeans....these will be the pair that changes your mind! Absolutely buy these! They're amazing in every way!",

The fit is great \u2013 comfortable and stretchy, and they don't lose their shape in between washings! The fabric is durable but still breathable, and they are SO comfortable that I actually don't need to rush home to take them off at the end of the day. Plus I didn't have to spend 1/3 of my paycheck on them, definitely a great price for the quality!Delivery did take a few days longer than expected, but all in all, if you're a little bit curvy and need a new pair of reliable jeans that are actually flattering without suffocating you, I definitely recommend giving these a try! \ud83d\udc56\ud83d\udc99",

                "reviewText": "I have such a problem finding jeans that fit. I'm a straight for through the hips with hardly a butt. These are tighter through the hips and relaxed in the legs for me. I actually find them really comfortable, but they don't fit me as the picture shows. Otherwise I'd give 5 stars. But for the price and for jeans that are actually long enough, these are great. I'm 5'10\" with a thin frame. So the length is what is important for me. I do like that these are thicker jeans. They do have stretch. But they're not \"fitted\" through the legs like I expected. Still comfy enough to keep!",
