                "reviewText": "I'm usually not a fan of \" skinny jeans\" but these I am actually happy with! I have wider calves and so finding good jeans is hard for me! For me personally, these perfectly contain my lower belly, and while fitting properly around my hips and calves. I know with wear they will stretch which is good to feel just snug enough but not like terribly tight. I'm happy with the way they fit now! Actually boosted my confidence for the season my body is in right now..post partum. I was indecisive on color so I bought the dark blue and lighter blue. Love them both. 5 stars for overall feel, price and color. I need the high rise and these don't make me look or feel like I'm busting out the seems. I ordered a size 12 bc I wasn't sure what size I was but went with something probably one size up from before I got pregnant. I am also 5'5\" and got the regular 12 ( NOT long or NOT short). And they go perfectly the my ankles. I wouldn't want them any shorter or any longer. They are just right. I don't think weight matters here..just saying. Get what you'd normally get in your size and if you are worried, size up and compare which one you like best!I noticed on the lighter color, they have a few scuff marks for that \" torn Jean\" look. Not see through holes but just tearing on the outside pant.Hope this helps! I'd recommend to my friends and I'd also buy them again!",
