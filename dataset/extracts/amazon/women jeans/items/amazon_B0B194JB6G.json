No gap at all in the waist, and no muffin top. They are sleek and stylish, and can be dressed up or down with flats or heels. (I bought the darker blue wash with no rips or tears.).Buy your regular size if you want a fitted sleek look. Size up if you want a more relaxed casual look.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Fit big for Levi's.",
                "reviewText": "I got these in a size 30, 31 and 32 (all short), all in the color Tribeca Moves. For sizing reference, I'm usually a medium-large or a 8-12/29-31 in bottoms and jeans. If it helps, I wear a size 6 or 8 in Lulu leggings. I'm 5'3\" tall with a short torso, and my measurements are about 44\"-33\"-44\" (bust-waist-hip) right now, give or take.I think at this point I think I've purchased nearly every single style of women's Levi's jeans, and they have all been in a variety of sizes, as I find this brand is horribly inconsistent in that area. I've worn a size 33 in some, 29 in others, or in this case, a 30 fit me best. The first pair I got was in a size 32 and they were just too loose all over, mainly in the crotch and the waist. I have thicker thighs and calves, so they were fine there. I have pics of the size 32 and the 30, and I made sure to specify what size I'm wearing in which pics. I then returned that size for a 31, which was still looser than what I wanted (I forgot to take pics), and finally got a 30. For me, that was the perfect size. I don't like when jeans like this are loose in the crotch, so that size was perfect. I still have plenty of extra room in the waistband because it's stretchy, but I will say I wish there was a tad more room in the hips, as I have a bigger butt. Still, the 30 was the best fit for me. This is one of the few pairs of Levi's I've tried that I'd say is TTS.The material on these is soft and stretchy, though thankfully not as stretchy as the 711 skinny jeans I tried. I like stretch because it's generally just more comfortable, but too much and they end up bagging out and they just don't hold in the tummy like I prefer. These make me feel held in without being suffocated and they're still comfy. I've worn and washed mine probably about a dozen times now since purchase and they still look great and fit the same. I haven't had any issues with them bagging out, though I suppose they loosen up a tad throughout the day.I also really like this color. It's a pretty normal jean shade without being too dark or light. I'm glad it doesn't have much whiskering (those lines across the upper thighs) or weird patches of lighter material (some of them do that to make the thighs look \"smaller\", but I just think it looks stupid).The fit of these is a good median between a skinny jean and a straight jean. I appreciate that they aren't tight on the calf and I've grown to love ankle length. I got mine in the short version and ended up cutting the very edge of the cuff off to give them more of a raw look.Out of all the Levi's I've tried, I think I'd recommend these first. Comfy, cute, good color, TTS, fairly sturdy. Great jeans.",

As far as length goes, they're just as advertised in the picture and look great with ankle boots, loafers, or even mid-rise tennis shoes. I opted for a 27 regular size, which was perfect for me since I like having some room. However, if you prefer a more snug fit, I recommend going a size down as they were a little big around the hips and waist. Overall, these jeans are worth considering. Trust me, they're incredibly comfortable and feel like you're wearing your favorite PJs all day long!",

I usually hate buying clothes because nothing looks the way I want it to so I never spend more than $25 on anything.These jeans are awesome and they are my favorite pieces of clothing!For $25 they look good, feel good and accentuate my curves.I own two pairs of the Chelsea Scrape - Dark Indigo which are great for business dress down days in the office.I recently purchased the Tribeca Moon distressed jeans and they are so much better than i anticipated. They are soft, have the right amount of stretch without feeling like you are suffocating. I usually stay away from light colors but this color looks fantastic and is very flattering and versatile.I highly recommend giving these jeans a try!",

                "reviewText": "Come on Levi's...you can't afford a couple inches of white fabric for a real front pocket?!? This feature alone completely ruins otherwise nice jeans. It's stupid design--you can barely fit the first knuckle of your fingers. Some people actually like to use their front pockets to rest their hands in, or carry something!",
