I followed reviewer suggestions and ordered a size down. They fit great even after a trip through the washer and dryer.Be aware that the fabric is thinner and stretchier than jeans ordered on the Lucky website. Because of that, these jeans are actually more practical in Texas where I live.",

I don't think that I've ever purchased a pair of Lucky jeans new before. These are nice quality, I like the weight of the denim. The cut is flattering. They are not too big at the bottom, more of a baby boot. I think that I am solidly an \"8\" now (I'm about 5' 6\", 125 lbs with all the weight at the bottom) and these fit snug but not uncomfortable. They contain a decent amount of stretch and I think that the \"10\" would have stretched out too much and would also be too loose at the waist. These were a great price, so I decided to keep them.",
