                "reviewText": "I used to only wear Levi\u2019s when I was in my 20\u2019s. Then I had a baby and I\u2019m not sure if they made the high rise jeans yet but I stopped buying them because of my mom belly. Now I\u2019m 44 and I\u2019m a Levi girl again! Anything Levi\u2019s High Rise works great for me. It provides coverage for my mushy stomach and prevents muffin top. Before REdiscovering my Love for Levi\u2019s I struggled wih the fit, quality and style of other brands, never able to have all 3 and never feeling comfortable which is so important. \u2014 I went a decade of wearing tight belts and having to constantly pull up the waist of non-Levi jeans. I was at a Fry\u2019s marketplace and found Signature Levi\u2019s which is their lighter weight, SUPER stretchy non-REDtabbed jean. Because of the lighter weight (thinner material) they didn\u2019t last long for me because of rips in upper inner thigh area. Walking around with holes in that area becomes quit uncomfortable (sometimes painful). Thanks to Amazon marketplace and the wide variety I was able to venture out from the grocery store jeans and get reacquainted with my red-tabbed Levi\u2019s. The easy Levi\u2019s FIT GUIDE suggested several styles, all high-waisted btw. I am in heaven every time I open my Amazon delivery of Levi\u2019s jeans. No more tight belts or having to constantly pull the waist of my jeans up. These are red tab Levi\u2019s so the jean material is sturdier than their Signature line version but still has a good stretch that makes them look so flattering! It is the only brand I buy because of the consistency in sizing and I know if I order 33x30 high-rise they will fit\u2026 and I have never been let down. I have many pairs and even my oldest pair is still going strong so they are very durable. They have a stretch to them that is a miracle for me. I work 12 hour shifts in manufacturing production I am on my feet the whole time. I always wear jeans and only wear Levi\u2019s. They are so comfortable and flattering.I live in Arizona, so during the summer I wear the ones that have rips or holes in the legs which is like air conditioning for my legs. It is nice to grab a pair of jeans from my closet and always be putting on my favorite GO-TO jeans. I try to always wash and dry them inside out and remove them from dryer before they get super hot. Occasionally I forget to turn them inside out or forget to take them out of dryer\u2026but even then have had no issues with fit.I wonder if I can buy stock in Levi\u2019s because I believe these are the best jeans out there. I\u2019ve never tried $100+ jeans but why would I when there are so many styles and fits to choose from with Levi\u2019s. I love being able to buy 2 or 3 pairs of awesome fitting, stylish high quality jeans for the price of a pair of expensive brand jeans \u2696\ufe0f. Even the highest priced Levi\u2019s are a great buy. They have been doing jeans for a long time and they know how to make us look good while keeping us comfortable!I highly suggest taking the fit quiz.. because there are different style #s for different fits (such as 501, 311 and 711, 724 to name a few). With so many styles and sizes to choose from you are guaranteed to find something that fits you perfectly no matter what you body shape or size.",

                "reviewText": "These Levi's 721s are my absolute ride-or-die jeans! From the fantastic stretch that gracefully hugs every curve to the enduring shape that withstands years of less than gentle use, these jeans are my forever favorites. The material, with its luxurious thickness, speaks volumes about the quality. The color is a true, deep black that has me falling in love with them over and over again. The only reason I have to repurchase these jeans is because I don't listen to the instructions to wash minimally and not machine dry... it's a tradeoff I am okay with but let me tell you I have not once needed to repurchase these jeans due to tearing or other wear.What steals the show for me is the high waist \u2013 not just a style statement, but a confidence booster. It tucks me in just where I need it, making me feel on top of the world. At 5'1\", finding pants that don't demand alterations is a never-ending struggle, but Levi's short size is a game-changer. They fit like a dream, hitting all the right marks for someone with a petite frame.Let's talk real life \u2013 the stretch is a savior after indulging in a hearty meal at a restaurant or... due to weight fluctuations, you know how it is. Comfort and style, what more could I ask for? These jeans are not just a garment; they're a testament to finding that perfect fit, both in size and style. Levi's, you've won my heart! I'm a customer for life.",

                "reviewText": "I have lost 120 pounds in the past two years and I'm still losing, so I'll admit I'm still a little unsure of what fits my new body and what doesn't and I probably could have ordered a size down. I am 5'3\" 230 pounds currently and ordered a size 37 (20).First impression was that these jeans seemed to be well made, I didn't have any issues with weird tags that other people have had, luckily. So I'm confident that I'm reviewing the authentic product. The material itself is a thinner stretchy denim blend that is meant to conform to your body, not the stiff denim that was typical of Levi's I've had in the past so I'm not sure how they'll hold up to thick thighs over time but they are figure flattering. They are also a true high rise jean, they come a little past my belly button, of course they may come a bit lower or higher on you depending on how you're built. Either way though they come up high enough to offer that extra coverage to help hide your belly if you have one, which is the main concern for me.Now, for the two things I didn't like. One is almost to be expected since they were out of 'short' in my size. The regular is a bit long for someone of my height, though it's not so bad that I cant make it work, still not ideal. Then, let me just say, I wouldn't consider myself to be bird legged or anything--haha--in fact, I have a pair of skinny jeans from Torrid that are size 22 and the legs in those are like a second skin but the waist and butt are very baggy, they almost fall off. So I figured a 20 in these jeans would probably work fine, since in the past my experience with Levi's has mostly been that sometimes they run a bit smaller in the waist. I do have a c-section belly and excess skin from losing weight that I have to stuff in them. They fit ok everywhere else, maybe just a bit loose, but the calves and ankles are baggy and it doesn't look great. They're not very 'skinny' at all on me. I'm not going to bother with returning them I'm just going to wear them for now since they don't look terrible, they just aren't what I expected. I likely will need to replace them soon anyway but if I repurchase in the future I most definitely will take that into account and order the smaller size if I'm on the fence about which size I might need.",
