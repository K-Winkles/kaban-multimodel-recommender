                "reviewText": "I recently added a pair of bootcut style jeans to my wardrobe, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. These jeans have quickly become my go-to choice for a stylish and comfortable look.The fit is fantastic. The bootcut style is incredibly flattering, offering a balanced silhouette that complements various body types. The jeans are snug in all the right places, flaring out just below the knee to create a timeless and chic look. They manage to strike the perfect balance between fitted and relaxed, making them suitable for a range of occasions.The quality of the denim is outstanding. These jeans are durable and hold their shape even after numerous wears and washes. The fabric feels substantial yet soft against the skin, ensuring comfort throughout the day. I appreciate that they don't stretch out excessively, so I can confidently wear them all day without worrying about sagging.The versatility of bootcut jeans is another reason to love them. They pair effortlessly with a variety of tops, from casual tees to elegant blouses. Whether I'm dressing up for a night out or going for a more casual look, these jeans adapt beautifully to any style.I also want to mention the attention to detail in the design. The stitching and finish are impeccable, giving the jeans a polished appearance. The pockets are well-placed and functional, and the overall aesthetic is timeless, ensuring these jeans won't go out of style any time soon.One more thing to note is the length. These jeans are just the right length for me, and I appreciate that they can be easily worn with different shoe types, from heels to flats. I am 5'' tall and weight around 133lbs. I got size 27 Short.In terms of value, these bootcut jeans are a wise investment. They offer both style and durability, making them a staple piece in my wardrobe.I highly recommend these bootcut style jeans. They are not only fashionable but also comfortable and versatile. If you're looking for a pair of jeans that combines classic style with a modern fit, you won't be disappointed with these.",

They are very flattering, makes my body shape better! This was my first pair of jeans veering away from skinny jeans and they made me comfortable to do so. Only weird thing is the label on back of jeans at the top feels like cardboard not like traditional leather. Don\u2019t know if that\u2019s supposed to come off but it\u2019s lasted through the wash a few times. Oh and they are stretchy and comfortable to move in. Not a firm jeans fabric.",

They\u2019re a little stretchy & quite comfortable. My only complaint is the pair I received has a crooked seam. The outer seam going down the right leg is not straight & curves slightly towards the front of the leg (hence the 4 out of 5 stars).

Not be-bop look nor granny look. Runs a bit small & per reviews before I purchased, I sized up & they fit beautifully. Comfortable, flattering. For reference I'm 5'51/2 164lb. I ordered & love: Standard 31 short (Cast Shadows color).",

But I\u2019m not really complaining since they do the job and I just needed black jeans. I went two sizes down than usual because they are very stretchy.",

There is a lot of stretch but the waist is stiffer than the rest of the pants .. so I am sure I am not going to be as comfortable with these as with other jeans I have bought.. I got the lapis dark horse color in a 29 x 30. For me they are a true high rise. I am 5ft 3 around 135 lbs. Definitely if they were not stretchy I would not even think of keeping them... cause I will say that I need the stretch with these jeans .. the length is a bit long for me by like and inch . They are I think flattering and hug the butt and hips very well .. but since they are not as comfortable I am insecure that they do not look as good as when I look in the mirror.",
