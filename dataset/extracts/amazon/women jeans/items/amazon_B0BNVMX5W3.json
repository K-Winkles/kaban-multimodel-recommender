                "reviewText": "Great Jean. Great fit. I have to wiggle a little getting them on but once on.. LOVE THEM. wish there was about an extra inch higher on the waistline to pull in all my belly fat but does a pretty good job as is. They are not tight on my mid calf, like most jeans, with these, the boot-cut flair starts just above the knee giving you that perfect fit. Looks AMAZING with cowgirl boots, work-boots & just tennis shoes. Perfect length for me. I'm 5'3.5\" about 200 with lots of momma belly & a saggy butt. These hide it all very well. Very comfortable & doesn't cut off any circulation when bending or sitting. I tried those flamingal jeans and they were same size but fit terribly. This brand will definitely be my go to from now on.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love , love , love these jeans!!! I first read a lot of reviews to judge my size because these jeans run in small , medium, large , etc.. I am 5\u20195 , and weigh around 163 lbs. My average size is 7/8. The sizing said I\u2019d probably be a large. I ordered a large, and I felt they were too big. I then ordered a medium. They fit very good. They did get a little loose after wearing them a full day. I\u2019m hoping after a good hot wash and dry.. they\u2019ll shrink a little. Over all\u2026 \ud83e\udd70 I\u2019ve since ordered two more pairs. These are definitely my favorite jeans !!! They are a must have!! You won\u2019t regret the comfort of the spandex feel. Order Yours Now!!!",

                "reviewText": "If you have even a little tummy, you'll want to wear a tunic or cover shirt. They have no tummy control. Pants will be great for someone who has less than an hourglass figure or a belt will likely need to be worn. The waist / hip ratio is closer than most women's pants. The denim quality seems to be okay, plenty of stretch. Most reviews are saying size up, however, I could have sized down with the amount of stretch. Length of the pants are fine for walking shoes or low heel boot. I'm 5'3'', 185 lbs and I carry most of my weight in my thighs and bottom.",

                "reviewText": "So I did NOT want to buy a pair of jeans from Amazon. Not because it\u2019s Amazon, but because I had no idea who these were even coming from. I thought they\u2019d be cheap, Ill fitting, etc. I\u2019m 61, 5\u20195\u201d, 180. Big through hip/thigh. Nothing ever truly fits. Inseam ALWAYS too long. But I looked at NUMEROUS comments and it kind of seemed like these might be good DUE to the above reasons. I don\u2019t really wear heels but do wear boots and low heels. These are amazing. I threw them into my suitcase as I was about to take a trip - without trying them on because they arrived the day before I left. was going to a football game and had a look planned out and this could have ruined it. I love these jeans. They were slightly snug (I got XL) but relaxed a tad, but not super stretched out to where I grew uncomfortable. They are a little loose in the waist but an elastic belt fixed that easily. Everything is loose in the waist with my body type. My alterations lady will nip them in about an inch or so and they\u2019ll be perfect. I didn\u2019t mind the pockets, they were a bit nostalgic for me. One of the best pair of jeans I\u2019ve ever owned.",

But overall so far 5 stars, we will see how long they last. If I was to change anything about them I would make the butt a touch bigger. I don\u2019t have a big butt however the back of the jeans do dip down with a more flat butt style of cut. The front fits and sits perfectly. Overall even with needing a belt to keep the back in place I still give them the 5 stars.",
