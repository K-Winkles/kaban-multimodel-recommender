                "reviewText": "These look like a decent quality for the price, unfortunately they just do not work for me. I like the color and there is plenty of stretch but I am in between sized and the size I ordered fit my legs well, but they were way to big in the waist. I probably should have ordered a size down but was concerned the leg would be to tight (I hate that) and thought since these were curvy it would be okay. It was not. Hope they work for you - they are cute. To help, I ordered an 8. 5'6 145 lbs, my waist is currently about a 30",

So my pants are tight and I have a small muffin top 360 degrees. I sized up from normal and ordered a 31. These pants have stretch. I would have been fine in a 30 and 29 would have been snug. My husband did comment and say my butt looked good tonight. So that\u2019s a plus! First time he hasn\u2019t seen muffin top in a while! (And he didn\u2019t know they were new!) you won\u2019t regret these pants. Spend the money and order them! Life is short, splurge a little! Cheers to the 2nd most expensive pants I have ever owned.",
