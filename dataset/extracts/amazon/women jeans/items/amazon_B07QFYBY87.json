I'm not mad about it because I need both colors so I'm hoping by ordering again I will just receive the right pair this time. But that's a testament to how could these fit! I normally am in the store for HOURS because I've had three kids and jeans just fit weird but these are perfect in every way. Awesome stretch, fit, hugs in all the right places. I'm 5'4 and 170 (just had a baby) and tried the size 10 when amazon was recommending a 12. I'm super happy with what I received. I fully expected to have to send these back!",

I however will be returning them because the back of the pants is lower than the front, which sets off my sensory issues. They are stretchy, which is kinda nice, but not sure if I'll really like that.I'm 5'6\" and I'm like a 31\" inseam. I bought the 30 inseam, which feels a tiny bit too short, and I'm not going to hem jeans (I don't have time to learn that right now...).These look cute, and would go with a t shirt or a nice blouse, but the comfort isn't there for me. I'm going to be purchasing several different jeans from Amazon in the next week to try to find what I like, and the high rise of this same jean is on my list.EDIT: after trying a high rise pair of these same pants, and a few other jeans, these were the best. I bought them again, again, in a size 10, 30 length.I'll be purchasing a size 12 with a length of 32 next, to see if it feels better.",
