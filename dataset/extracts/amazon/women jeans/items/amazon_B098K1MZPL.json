I would say these are a boyfriend-leaning straight style, loose through the knee and semi fitted through the thigh. The photos in the other review showed an accurate fit in my opinion. Size down if you want more of a \u201cstraight\u201d fitted leg look. It\u2019s stretchy enough that I could fit into a 31 but I liked how comfortable the 32 is. Looks great with a belt and top tucked in (I have to hike up without a belt). I am 5\u20194\u201d and ended up cutting off about 2\u201d in the hem and re-fraying it myself.",
