These jeans are PERFECTlY fit for both my straight shape body- and for curvy shapes. My sister has a curvy shape with a bit more in her behind. She bought the same pair and the jeans look custom-made for her as well! Excellent feel of the fabric. Durable, but smooth - not a rough, thick jean material. It has a slight stretch to it but does NOT look like a lycra pant at all. I purchased the pants in the khaki color and once I put them on today, have not taken them off! They are that comfortable and make you look sleek and slimmer - no negatives about them. I just bought another pair of blue jeans material. Definitely stock up on these!",
