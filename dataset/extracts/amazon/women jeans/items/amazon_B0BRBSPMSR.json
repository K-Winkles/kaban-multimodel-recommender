                "reviewText": "Silver jeans are the best!! i used to be staunchly anti-jeans. they were always too stiff and uncomfortable. i NEVER wore them. Then i found silver jeans and was converted! now i wear silver jeans nearly every day! i have a slim hourglass shape and they conform to all my curves --no gap at the waist and perfect through the hips. the fabric is a nice mix so they look good AND are comfy to wear. they don't lose their shape. The tag says to buy them snug and that's the key to getting a good fit. you need to find what snug means for you. i am one of those people who err on the side of caution. i'd rather have it be a tiny bit too big than a bit too small. i had to adjust my thinking with these jeans. had i gone with the bigger size, they would've been too big. they conform to your shape so they should be snug when you first put them on but they quickly find their way to fit your body. be sure to follow the washing instructions so you don't shrink them. seriously the best jeans ever! (i've got my husband hooked on the silver jeans allan fit.) of all the silver jeans i have (and i have a lot!) these are my favorites at the moment. i like the deep color and the skinny fit that isn't so skinny that my muscular calves are being strangled. i also love that the thread/stitching isn't that horrid orange color! buy at least 2 sizes to see what works best for you --keeping in mind the snug fit suggestion. Keep the tags on and wear them around your house for a few hours to see how the snug fit will conform to your shape. i'm 5'5\" 128 pounds and and a slender hourglass shape. i wear a 27 in suki, though sometimes i go to the 26 to get that snugness that i need to get to my perfect fit. i got the 26s in these but accidentally chose the 27s i also got (and returned) for the review. so i did go down to the smaller size in this particular fabric mix. i have seen these jeans on plus size women and they look equally sexy! no matter your shape or size, silver jeans has a fit that'll work for you. i did not get these jeans as part of any promotion. i just love them so much and i want others to discover how awesome they can look wearing them!",

This pair definitely fit more like a skinny jean all the way through, but the feel was a little bit rougher and not soft like my other pair, plus it came smelling like someone spilled some essential oil on it. With this pair, maybe going up to a size 28, would be more comfortable because this 27 is really tight. I also have the Silver Eliyse in size 25, and I would say my actual size is between 4/6, curvy bigger butt and thigh, smaller waist. It does have good butt coverage, but not comfortable in the legs. Just wished their sizing is more consistent.",

                "reviewText": "I had to order a 2nd pair because the 1st pair, which I ordered according to the size chart, grew to be very large by midday. I don't like my jeans skin tight, but I like them to fit & not bag or have to be hitched up every other minute. I'm 5' 4\" at 119 lbs with a proportional body shape. I ordered the 27x30 the first time & went down to the 26x30. The length is a tiny bit long but I like that with boots and flip flops. These jeans do look really good on & I almost never say that...I may have never said it before. They are very comfortable too. I have a 2nd pair of Silver Jeans now in another style. Just waiting for them to be delivered!",
