I wanted something I could use in the summer without heating up the whole house, so I decided to give this a try. The crust turns out better than in the oven. This thing heats up in less time than it takes for me to roll out the crust. Per instructions, I precook the crust for 5 minutes, add toppings, cook 10 minutes more, turns out perfect. Just wipe clean (I'm pretty careful not to spill cheese on the cooking surface, but it's easy enough to clean if there's a mishap). At a reasonable price, I've already gotten my money's worth having used it ~20 times in the last month.",
