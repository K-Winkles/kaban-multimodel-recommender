                "reviewText": "This is by far a great upgrade to my previous Big Green Egg. The big green egg I had for 25 years and it had been used at least several time a month since the time I bought it, worked great no problems. I was reading about the Kamado Joe and started looking into it. The reason I replaced my big green egg with the Kamado Joe was for these reasons, first it had a removable drawer for the ash easy to clean, the BGE you have to take the grate out and scrape out the ash with a small scoop. Second and this is main reason that I like the Kamado Joe is the split grill rack that are adjustable heights for variable cooking and the half circle ceramic plates. My BGE I did purchase a ceramic insert plate but it was a full circle plate which prevented the flames from burning the bottom of the grill, but I had to take out the grill and ceramic plate every time I need to add charcoal to the smoker for long cooks. The third reason is the main gasket it is made from a stainless steel mesh which last longer than the felt gasket than on the BGE and does not leak air inside which is easier to control the internal temperature. Finally the fourth reason is the pivoting hinge on the heavy top of the smoker that you can open with your finger. There is nothing wrong with the big green egg and I would still be using it today, but I really like these features of the Kamado Joe as I enjoy cooking with it and plan on having it for 25 plus years in the future.",

I was able (with difficulty) to re-assemble it, and now it works fine. The instructions for doing so were non-existent, so even after Googling and YouTubing, I had to just fiddle around with it until I figured it out. Otherwise, the grill is sturdy and well-made, and I am pleased with the quality.",

Kamado Joe would not assist me in obtaining the needed replacement parts to repair myself. You can not reach Kamado Joe by telephone. I had to create a case and then they emailed me and advised that I would have to work with Amazon on the replacement. Amazon only solution was to replace the grill in its entirety.",
