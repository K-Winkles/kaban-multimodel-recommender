                "reviewText": "First, I don\u2019t own a Cuisinart air fryer but I do own an Oster double door air fryer. These Teflon liners were easy to trim with a pair of kitchen scissors to fit my oven and they lie flat in the bottom crumb tray providing great protection for the tray. These liners are very easy to clean requiring only a sponge and a little dish soap to clean. I previously used aluminum foil on my bottom trays but had to be replaced every three or four days. These liners can be cleaned in two minutes and eliminate the need to use large quantities of foil. These liners are safe to use up to about 475 degrees. Highly recommended",

I often like to reheat pizza or chicken strips in the toaster oven so it stays crispy, but hate to always use foil to keep it from making a mess. Well, this makes it super easy and efficient. I cook right on it, and it easily washes up. No more foil in the trash all the time.I do not own a Cuisinart, so I did have to cut this liner to fit my oven/air fryer better. This was very simple to do. This product cuts very easily with any sharp scissors.",
