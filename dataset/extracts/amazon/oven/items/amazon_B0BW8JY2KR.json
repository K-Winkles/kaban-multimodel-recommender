Two are for the temperature, one is for the timer and the bottom one is for the function that is needed. The knobs are turned to set temp and timer and function. After set, push in knob. The food should already be in oven and then it will start heating up. Once it's heated up it will start cooking. It is large, can hold a whole rotisserie chicken, so it does take up a lot of counter space. It took a while to get used to each function because it's a little difficult to figure out the pictures.",

With the different modes you can bake, roast, air fry, toast, defrost and more. I love enjoy making pizza from scratch at home so the pizza mode was the first thing I tried when it arrived. The pizza came out perfect, of course I paid attention to it the entire time since it was my first time using it but the pizza came out great. Overall great oven and I can\u2019t wait to cook more meals in it. Next I\u2019m trying the chicken mode, hopefully is works just as good.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Cutting to the chase: First, appliance has great capacity, but the overly complex buttons/dials for usage make it a no-go for my household. Second, takes a long time to heat up yet is scorching hot to touch in use. Last, every element feels lightweight and cheap. More details below, but there's no reason to choose this toaster oven---especially if you have kids or elderly people in your family.Getting it out of the box I was shocked and concerned at how lightweight it is, considering the large size. Every bit of it of feels cheap and thin (which could be why it gets so hot to the touch when in use). At first glance it looks super-high-tech but the handles/knobs/door all feel more like a kid's toy and not an appliance going for over two hundred bucks.There are way too many options for cooking. You can choose top or bottom heat or both; dough proofing; defrost; or rotisserie. And there are additional presets for pizza and toast. The bottom dial has the main options, with only small icons to choose from (no words). There are additional buttons to press for convection and rotation (for rotisserie). If you want specific temperatures and time then you have to also set those dials separately. Way too much input required!This is described as \"digital\" but that really just means \"digital display.\" There's no keypad to type in temp/time, you have to manually turn little knobs to roll the numbers up or down.The process to start the machine is confusing. Several times someone thought they had the machine turned on, only to realize it never did anything while waiting for all the inputs to be set. When the machine is preheating, the timer flashes wholly; when it reaches the desired temperature it starts the timer countdown and flashes just the right-hand digit. The standby on/off button flashes CONSTANTLY when it's plugged in, super annoying. Timer is in minutes but for defrost/proof mode it's hours, what why?If you need the oven to preheat, then realize it takes a long time (almost as long as my giant wall oven). Just to get to 350F it took between 10-15 minutes. Heating it up for pizza is ridiculously long. It flashes the timer button while preheating and beeps when it's ready. You're not supposed to press the convection fan button while it's preheating, so that's another step you'll probably forget to do when it's time to put the food inside. And be careful, touch the door or almost any other part (including the handle) and you risk a burn!The instruction manual is the typical nonsense that looks like it was written with AI using Google Translate. Comes with an additional recipe book that's not specific to this toaster oven at all.As for how it cooks, during the 2 weeks I had this in use, we cooked: pizza, toast, frozen chicken strips, cinnamon rolls, brownies, chicken casserole; plus reheating various things. In no case was the result super-fantastic or better than the older GE Toaster Oven it replaced (and that one also had air-fry), the food was fine but not worth all the hassle.",

                "reviewText": "I love my WerkWeit Air Fryer Toaster Oven! It's so easy to use and it makes everything crispy and delicious. I can cook a whole chicken in 38QT of space, or make toast and bagels for breakfast. It has a digital display and a timer, so I don't have to worry about overcooking or burning anything. It also comes with a recipe book and some accessories, like a rotisserie spit and a baking tray. It's definitely worth the money and I would recommend it to anyone who loves fried food but wants to eat healthier.I bought the WerkWeit 38QT Air Fryer Toaster Oven a few weeks ago and I'm very happy with it. It's a versatile appliance that can do everything from air frying, baking, roasting, toasting, and even dehydrating. It has a large capacity that can fit a whole chicken, a 12-inch pizza, or four slices of bread. It also has a digital display and easy-to-use buttons and knobs that let you choose from nine preset functions or customize the time and temperature. The air fryer function works well and makes crispy food without using much oil. The oven also heats up quickly and evenly, and has a light that lets you see inside. The accessories are dishwasher-safe and easy to clean. The only downside is that it's quite bulky and takes up a lot of counter space. But if you're looking for a multifunctional air fryer toaster oven that can handle large batches of food, this is a great option. It's a little pricey but feature rich and I would recommend it to anyone who loves fried food but wants to eat healthier.",
