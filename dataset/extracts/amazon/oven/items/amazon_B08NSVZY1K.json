In reading extensively, I found that the only thing keeping my Breville from being an air fryer was a perfectly sized stainless steel cage which fits the rack slots, and a slightly undersized stainless tray (to fit below the cage and enhance air flow).This Cosovi cage fits the tray slots on my Breville perfectly - this cage turns my Breville into an air fryer! So much cheaper than buying a new toaster oven.Highly recommended.",

With the tiny basket can only make French Fry servings for 1.5 people at a time which is not practical when it takes 25 minutes to make them. I have been wanting a larger basket and this is it! This fits perfectly on the rack inside the Omni Plus. No more staggering dinner so that I can have fresh hot French Fries for two! It was FANTASTIC. I am going to buy a second one now so that when I need to turn the fries over I can just dump them into another basket and save time and the dropping of the occasional fry or two when I try to just flip them over quickly. First photo shows how Basket fits on wire rack. Second Photo shows the original basket that comes with the oven inside this Cosori basket to show the size increase you get.",

My original basket got to the point where it was impossible to clean anymore, even with a wire brush and steel wool, so I needed a replacement. Breville doesn't even offer a replacement basket for the 860 series Smart Oven: only their 900 series. This basket is almost a duplicate of the Breville and is very sturdy.",
