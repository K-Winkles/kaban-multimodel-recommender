                "reviewText": "This appliance is so easy to use, instructions are straight forward, and its easy to clean. Trays come clean with just soapy water and a sponge. If you have a postage stamp sized kitchen, its worth the counter space as it is compact in size but can still roast a whole chicken. I like that the beep isn't ear piercing when its done but still loud enough to be heard. I have a tiny kitchen with an apartment sized stove and this machine makes it much easier to stage food to cook so everything is served at the same temp using fewer pots, pans, and dishes. Used in tandem with an Instant Pot and an Instant Slow Cooker I'll likely not have to use the stove terribly often. So worth it.",

                "reviewText": "\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50I recently purchased the Instant Vortex Plus 6QT Air Fryer with Odor Erase Technology, and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations! This appliance is an absolute game-changer in my kitchen.Firstly, the 6-in-1 functionality is remarkable. It crisps, roasts, broils, dehydrates, bakes, and reheats with unparalleled ease. Whether I'm whipping up a batch of crispy fries, roasting vegetables to perfection, or dehydrating fruits for a healthy snack, this air fryer does it all flawlessly.The Odor Erase Technology is truly a godsend. No more lingering smells from frying or cooking - this feature ensures that my kitchen stays fresh and odor-free, even after cooking the most flavorful dishes.Another aspect that I love about this air fryer is the extensive collection of in-app recipes. With over 100 recipes to choose from, I never run out of inspiration for delicious meals and snacks. The recipes are easy to follow and yield mouthwatering results every time.Furthermore, the build quality of the Instant Vortex Plus is top-notch. It feels sturdy and well-made, assuring me of its durability and longevity.Overall, I can't recommend the Instant Vortex Plus 6QT Air Fryer enough. It's versatile, convenient, and produces restaurant-quality results. If you're looking to revolutionize your cooking experience, look no further than this fantastic appliance from the makers of Instant Pot.",

                "reviewText": "It does almost everything it claims to do.THE GOOD:REHEATING - This thing is awesome! I now can use the air fry to reheat things I never would have reheated before. Reheated french fries are sometimes even better! Crispy outside, fluffy inside.ROTISSERIE - I did a Cornish hen and it came out wonderful. You can do a very small chicken but any larger will not fit. It cooked faster than I thought it would. About 2/3 the time it would have spent in the oven. And the perfectly browned and crispy skin all over was as tasty as it looked.AIR FRY - Great for things that were previously fried like frozen fries, chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks... But I'm not giving up the deep fryer for making tbese things from scratch.BAKE - Pretty good. Because of it's size you're not making anything too large in here but you can use both racks at the same time. Be careful with anthing that rises though, the heating element is on the top and you want to make sure to keep your items a safe distance. Also be careful with time and temperature. This does cook faster. Again plan on 2/3 the time and add more if needed.BROIL - This is no different than air frying. But it's still good.THE BAD:DEHYDRATE - There are only 2 racks so you're only going to fit a very small amount in there. The fan will blow your items around as they dehydrate and become lighter in weight. I haven't tried herbs yet but I imagine them flying all over in there. It takes a very long tiime, 14 hours for thinly sliced apples. I really don't want this tied up that long.THE UGLY:TOAST - I have only tried white bread so far. It comes out way too dry to enjoy. I have been able to make it a bit better by putting a cup of boing water on the bottom tray. The only way I could get a good slice of toast was to spread it with butter BEFORE toasting it. It took longer to toast but it was good if you want buttered toast but that doesn't work for cream cheese or other toppings. I do think it will make good croutons though.Frozen waffles are too dry too unless you have thicker, belgian style waffles.OTHER THINGS TO CONSIDER:CLEANING - Easy to clean as long as you do it every time. The racks and drip tray are dishwasher safe but are so easy to rinse clean there is no need to use the dishwasher. And the nonstick coating will last much longer if you wash by hand. The basket is not coated and not as easy to clean. The door comes off to make it easier to clean. While not much fat is used with this there will be small oil splatters on the sides. I recommend cleaning the sides each use or the splatters will cook on and yellow. I hate that but it's up to you how much you clean it.HOT - The racks and anything you put in it will be very hot! Don't let kids use this and do keep an oven mitt nearby.SPACE - The width and depth are the size of a small toaster oven. The height is over 14 inches and you need a couple inches above it to vent. It will fit under most wall cabinets. But, if your cabinets are hung low or you have trim around the bottome of them, this may not fit. Just take a minute to measure first. If you have less than 16 inches between your counter and upper cabinets you shoud look for somthing else.APPERANCE - This looks great in my kitchen. I think it would look good in any kitchen with black or stainless steel appliances. It's very clean and modern.I hope this helps you with your decision.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE (10/31): The door comment I mentioned below turned out to be a non-issue. I am satisfied that the door operates as it should. I just need to be mindful to use two hands to steady the oven when I close it. I do think the oven temp runs a little hot. But, I haven't got a oven thermostat yet, to test it. The smell from the first couple uses has disappeared. Otherwise, this oven is a very good value. And it looks and feels like it will hold up over time. Thx \ud83d\ude0a==========MY EARLIER COMMENTS:I received the oven last week, so this is an early review. As my subject line says, this is very nice oven and good value for the price ($120). But there's a couple of qualifiers to this early review that I am evaluating.First, the door - which feels solid and well made - doesn't always close correctly. It closes askew about 25-30% of the time when closing it with ONE hand. If I put my second hand on top of the oven and then close it, it lines up properly almost all the time. It seems to be something I have to be cognizant of when I use the oven. But it does leave me with a question on how well the mechanism will hold up over time. More TBD.Second, I not sure about the accuracy of its temperature control. I baked a frozen (half) pizza the other day - a good quality pizza at that. It got pretty crispy on the middle rack, after 9 minutes at 400\u00b0F (the oven max temp). The instructions said for 11-12 min at 425\u00b0. I am going to use a temp probe later, to check it's temperature accuracy.Lastly as others have commented, it gives off a chemically type smell during the first uses, which I could also taste in the food (I've used the oven 3 times). That said, I am going to \"season\" the oven by running it at max temp for 15 min (as someone else suggested). I suspect that will resolve the smell issue.TBC ... I will update this post in a couple weeks.",

                "reviewText": "I was going to return this because of a lot of cons i read on the reviews plus I don\u2019t have a lot of counter or storage space but I\u2019m sick of feeding my son and bf fried foods cooked in oil especially my son, who loves fried foods.My take on the cons I read1. Plastic smell- when I opened the air fryer for the first time, there\u2019s a wiff of plastic smell. Per the cleaning instructions, I wiped the inside with damp towel and dried it. I did this several times until I can no longer smell plastic when I stick my nose in it. I also washed the 2 trays and grease tray with warm water and diswashing soap and dried it with clean towel. I ran an empty cycle using Airfryer for 20min and almost immediately, there\u2019s a strong plastic smell filling my kitchen. I did 2 empty cycles for 20min each and I\u2019ve been smelling the vent behind it for plastic smell. During the 2nd cycle, the plastic smell wasn\u2019t as strong as the first cycle. I used it to cook food for the first time after few hours and the food did not smell or taste plastic.Bottomline for the plastic smell, I think cleaning the inside with damp towel and washing the trays really helped get rid of the smell in my opinion. I ran 2 empty cycles for 20min each and the plastic smell was gone.2. Touchscreen not sensitive enough- for this one, I don\u2019t really have a problem with it. Mine is working great. No need to touch it multiples times or even hard.3. Too loud- I\u2019m not sure if its because I always have Grey\u2019s Anatomy playing on my tv whenever I ran my airfryer but I don\u2019t think mine is as loud as some people mentioned.4. Beep too quite- Yes, the beep indeed is quite, but my solution to that is just setting my phone alarm.Food taste so much better and flavourful compared to conventional oven cooked foods.I have not tried the basket or the rotisserie but I\u2019m excited to cook lechon belly in it soon.Overall, I\u2019m very happy with this. This is my very first big appliance purchase since my bf and I started living at our own place. It will help me with dinner especially because I work the graveyard shift and I can cook my son all the fried food his little heart wants.",
