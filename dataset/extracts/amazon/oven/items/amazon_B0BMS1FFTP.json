            "MAKE ADJUSTMENTS ON-THE-FLY \u2013 Want hotter temperature or need to cook it longer? No problem. Simply adjust on-the-fly any time. Starting the cooking process over is not necessary. Bravo\u2019s intuitive digital controls are easy to operate. Control not only the time and temperature but also customize the top and bottom heaters. To bake a perfect pizza, set bottom heaters at full power and top heaters at 30% for crispy crunch crust and perfectly melted cheesy toppings.",
            "INTEGRATED DIGITAL TEMPERATURE PROBE \u2013 Once the desired doneness temperature is set, Bravo constantly monitors the internal temperature of your food and automatically ends the cooking process when the desired internal temperature is reached. You will never undercook or overcook your food again.",
            "LINEAR THERMAL (LINEAR T) TECHNOLOGY \u2013 Set cooking temperatures from 50\u00b0F and 500\u00b0F adjustable in precise 5\u00b0F increments. Patented Linear T Technology executes the set temperature accurately throughout the entire cooking process by continuously monitoring temperature fluctuations and making constant power adjustments every second to maintain the set temperature to ensure perfect results. Unlike the primitive methods of turning the heater on and off, our heater never turns off while cooking.",
            "HIGH-QUALITY CONSTRUCTION \u2013 From the heat-resistant and shatter-proof tempered glass door to the heavy-duty cooking racks, to the non-stick enamel baking pan with broiler rack, and air fry basket, everything that comes with the NuWave Bravo XL is made with quality in mind."

                "reviewText": "I haven\u2019t had a working oven for a few years, so I bought this as an affordable alternative. I am very happy with it! I have made a ton of different meats in it-pork chops, meatloaf, chicken breasts, and steak and they\u2019ve all come out perfectly cooked and incredibly juicy! I have also tried all sorts of things that I haven\u2019t made before due to a lack of an oven and they\u2019ve all turned out great. Things like sweet potato fries, steak fries, asparagus, and fried okra. Everything comes out tasting amazing and makes me look like a much better cook than I am!It took me several minutes to figure out how to set things up correctly the first time I used it. The controls can be a little confusing if it\u2019s your first time using it, but the instruction manual made it relatively easy to get it started.My main complaint with it, is I thought I would be able to have multiple things in it cooking at once, but it doesn\u2019t work very well for that. I tried to cook sweet potato fries on one shelf and steak fries on the other shelf at the same time once and it drastically increased the amount of time it took to cook.Overall I am very impressed with this air fryer. The price couldn\u2019t be beat and the amount of things I make now has increased ten fold and my family is pretty happy about that. I would highly recommend!",
