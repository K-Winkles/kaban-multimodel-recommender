I had the 3 nobs before and just wanted something a bit more straightforward. Saw this one and it was cheaper so I ordered it. The previous one I had I think lasted me a good 3 years before it broke. So I am hoping for the same with this one. Delivery was quick and the product was delivered with care to my home in the box you see shown. What I really love about this BLACK+DECKER 4-Slice Toaster Oven with Easy Controls, Stainless Steel, TO1705SB, Medium is its simplicity! My 12-year-old had a little trouble with the first one but this is so straightforward that she has no issues using it. So far I am like I said happy and satisfied. Best $25.86 spent!!!",

That's the main reason I bought this little toaster oven: it doesn't require a lot of electricity.I've only been using this oven for a week or so. So far, I've used it to bake artisan bread, scalloped potatoes, and cranberry muffins. It works great, except for one thing: I can't figure out how to use the \"Stay On\" feature. Regardless of whether I turn the knob clockwise or counterclockwise, I can't get it to point at \"Stay On.\" Because of this, I have to keep re-setting the timer if I need to bake anything for more than 30 minutes. This is a major annoyance, because the \"Stay On\" feature is the main reason I chose this particular toaster oven over other small toaster ovens.",

I kept it for a month to give it a chance before returning. I gave it 3 stars because the baking feature is ok.",
