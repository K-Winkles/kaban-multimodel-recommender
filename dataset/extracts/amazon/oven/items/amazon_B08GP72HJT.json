We've found that setting it to 375 for 18 min works great for two trays of fries (one layer, slightly spaced). When it's done, pull out the top tray with an oven mitt and move the bottom tray up to that spot and cook for another 5 min. (the top tray cooks faster). Let each tray cool for 4 minutes before removing the fries (especially if you're not using oil) and the fries come free very easily. We've been using this air fryer for more than a year and a half and it's still working great. Also, the trays look new after running them through the dishwasher.",
