                "reviewText": "Bought this for Thanksgiving dinner, since I\u2019m usually the person in my family to cook a feast! \ud83d\ude0aTraditionally, I have always followed the basic traditional method of Turkey in baking pans, basing etc. On some years my turkey would either run a bit dry or just right. \ud83e\udd7a I thought it was time to invest in one and boy, I am glad! I\u2019ll admit, I was skeptical in what it could do.Pros:\u2022 easy to clean (I do see that after a session of Turkey cooking there was some slight build up, but nothing some good old scrubbing won\u2019t fix)\u2022 kept turkey meat moist, crispy on the outside and browned evenly\u2022 a nice holder to prop the turkey up and add your garnishes and herbs to the bottom\u2022 plenty of recipes online to help utilize your oven with measurements etc\u2022 cooking time was relatively faster than traditional cooking for me\u2022 heat was evenly distributed and conducted well\u2022 design is sleek and fitting\u2022 holds up to a large Turkey of 26lbs\u2022 you place your choice of meat and walk away to multitask on other dishes/sides\u2022 nice little glass window opening to peep in on your cooked mealCons:\u2022 a little bulky for some (but I wanted something that was large to feed a family of over 8 people)\u2022 finding kitchen or storage place for it (luckily I have space in my garage)Overall, I was able to make delicious turkey. I made a 22lbs turkey that feed 14-15 people. This electric toaster oven made it possible for me to finish all my sides. I skipped all the parts of basing and worrying about the turkey being moist and supple. My family members and friends also raved about the turkey and I told them to invest in one of these. You could not go wrong with one of these in your kitchen especially if you usually cook for a larger crowd. I love my new roaster oven and will never go back to traditional methods. This oven will also be great for roasting brisket and any other slower cooked methods, which I will be trying out.",

                "reviewText": "I was nervous to try \"something new\" at our big dinner but needed extra oven space and gave it a go. it DOES brown and crisp the skin! It also cooks SUPER FAST! Our turkey went in around 9:20 am and was done before 11:30 am. I had calculated 3 hrs so Dinner wasn't until 1pm so had it turned off then on warming to keep it from cooking too long or getting cold etc. In spite of all that, at 1:15 pm we carved the turkey and it was still good! Nothing dried out at all. Perfectly done. I did use a wired thermometer to keep tabs on the temp and that let us know the bird was actually done way ahead of schedule. It was accurate. We even turned the heat down from 325 to 300 to slow the process down a bit.So the key here is to PRE HEAT as high as it will go and keep it there while dressing the bird. Carefully put it in (husband did this part) and close the lid and DO NOT OPEN IT for at least an hour or more. The window was clear and you could see it fine. I think if you open it too soon you will not get the browned skin effect. It was reading 'done' on the thermometer less than an hour and half in and the bird was already browned. We had to make sure it was actually done so we opened it. Glad we did check because it was done alright. Note: I had separated the skin to put butter under it so during the cooking, half of the breast skin pulled away because I over stretched it. Otherwise it is definitely nicely browned. This was a good purchase. Looking forward to try Prim Rib Roast and other meats!",

                "reviewText": "The unit arrived on time with good packaging and no visible damage. I have owned a roaster before, so I have reasonable expectations. First, it is extremely light weight, which can be good as these are large and can be hard to move and store. Though I ordered and received the item labeled 24 qt, which should technically be larger than my old 21 qt, it \"seems\" smaller. It is narrower, but with the domed lid it is taller. I do hope I can roast a 24/25 lb. turkey. I will update after Thanksgiving! The worst issue might be a deal breaker for others, but I am going to live with it -- The black inner liner has some bent/rough/sharp edges where it meets the main unit. This is not the removable inner cooking pan, but the permanent cooking shell that the pan sits in. I've attached a couple of pics, but it is really hard to see. I did get a small cut when taking it out of the box the first time. Was quite startling! But, it took me a bit to figure out how it happened. Just not great workmanship.",

As we use a roaster several times a month the size is why we ordered it and the glass see thru on the top is bigger than expected. The fact that it can be turned off, where most roasters just turn to warm was another selling point. We used our last roaster for many years and expect to use this one just as long.",
