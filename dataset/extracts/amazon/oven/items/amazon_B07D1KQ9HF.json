        "description": "You won\u2019t find a design like the Hamilton Beach easy reach toaster oven with roll-top door anywhere else. Its unique and large opening makes food easy to reach. And since the door opens above the oven, it frees up your countertop space in front. Best of all, it\u2019s easy to keep clean because food can\u2019t spill on the door. Contoured dials are easy to grip and turn, making it simple to switch between bake, broil and toast settings. The stay-on setting is safer thanks to a stop mechanism that prevents the knob from being turned to stay-on by accident.

The bake function is great for making delicious cakes and desserts. Use convection for crisp, golden-brown pizza and for an evenly cooked, caramelized crust on baked goods. Convection provides more even cooking as the fan circulates heated air continuously around the food. Convection typically reduces cooking time by up to 25%. Fits a 9\u201d x 11\u201d Bake Pan, 12\u201d Pizza, or 6 Slices of Toast With 4 settings and a spacious interior, the Hamilton Beach Easy Reach Toaster Oven can accommodate the foods your family makes most: after-school snacks, toast, frozen pizzas or homemade meals. Easy-to-Grip, Contoured Knobs This toaster oven is the first of its kind to have an innovative design that makes grasping and turning the control dials easy for anyone.

I haven't used the \"convection\" setting yet but overall I am very impressed with this toaster oven. I do wish the power cord was little longer and I really don't understand, if I have turned everything off, why I should have to \"unplug\" the unit after each use. But it doesn't take up much counter space and I love the way the door \"rolls up\" and out of the way. Highly recommended!",

The window stays clean since it rolls up out of the way.Only downside is there are no handles. You have to let it cool down before you move it. I didn\u2019t even think about that before I bought it.I also learned the hard way to remove a dish (left on top to warm) BEFORE opening the slide up door.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using a small Rival toaster oven for years but have wanted to upgrade to something larger. I've had my eye on the Hamilton Beach EAsy Open oven for a while so when it went on sale during Prime Days I got it for half its original cost and took the plunge. I've been using this oven nearly daily for the last few months without complaint. It has exceeded my expectations completely and then some.I love the easy open door... I wasn't sure how much clearance I would have under my counter but it's just the right height so I can easily open and close the door.The control knobs are fantastic and easy to read... I didn't want digital controls (my husband is completely in the dark when it comes to tech stuff) and these are so easy to use... very intuitive, plug it in and it basically explains itself... didn't really even need the manual to figure out how it works.It cooks to accurate temperatures as well. Some reviews stated that the cook temps were off, but I have not found this to be the case and have used an oven thermometer to test the termperatures. Besides using it for toast, I've made cookies, frozen dinners, mini pizzas, and a whole slew of things I would normally use the oven for, but in small batches... not having to turn on my oven and preheat for 20 minutes to cook a small portion of something is not only a time saver but an electricity saver as well.Cleaning the inside of the glass can be a challenge if you have large hands... fortunately for me I have small enough hands that I can get under it with a cleaning cloth and wipe off any grunge.Another thing I LOVE is that the crumb tray is full-size... it covers the entire bottom of the oven and is easily removable from underneath the bottom rack. No having to pop open crumb trays (like my old oven and toaster) amid a shower of toast crumbs. This is really easy to clean.I do wish the provided tray was large enough to fit into the rack slots... why HB only made it wide enough to sit on top of the rack is a bit of a mystery.All in all, for $49, this is easily one of the best things I've purchased for the house in a long time and would gladly buy this again.",

                "reviewText": "We have been needing to replace our 12-yr old Black & Decker toaster oven after burning my fingers way too many times on the glass door from the small ergo gap to grip the handle. After doing product comparison research for a week and reading many user reviews, this product stood out best for its overall size, features, and great price, without having to cave to the ever-popular but overpriced and oversized air fryer option. We have been using this oven for more than a month now.The overall size of this product is slightly larger than our replacement toaster oven, which is OK, given all the wonderful improvements. It is the perfect size for our small-ish counter space, which shares a Cutco knife block. We love the clear, readable, contrasting markings on the stainless panel and the dials are very easy to rotate (compared to B&D) with the perfect amount of resistance, and each dial also has curved ergo recesses on them (nice touch).The roll-up \"EasyReach\" door has a MUCH safer and larger ergo gap handle and the rolling door is SO handy and space-saving. The angled-back door and front panel surface provide us much easier access to reach the toasted or baked items on the rack without burning hands or having to slide the rack out at all as we did with the old one, which would often angle down or fall down completely and spill the items (BIG turn-off!). The roll-up door also prevents any food debris from falling onto the glass door as a regular flip-down door often does, which is hard to clean and often leaves brown baked stains on the glass.The oven fits an 11-in pizza perfectly thanks to the recessed bump-out shape on the back panel and also saves a ton of electricity to not have to preheat a large oven for such a small pizza. The convection setting also bakes a frozen pizza crust to a perfect crispness! The suggested settings for toasting bread slices are also spot-on for how I like mine golden brown.You will not go wrong in choosing this product if you have basic toaster oven needs and only a small space to do it in. VERY, VERY HAPPY! Thanks, Hamilton Beach.",

It looked good in theory and reviews, but what if ?Would I get service ? Would it be what we actually want ?I honestly don\u2019t know because we got it this morning.I am sharing pictures of the item and contents.The packaging was good and everything arrived in good condition.The accessories were again carefully double packed. Someone has paid serious attention to the packaging system.This also leads me to believe the ownership experience will be equally good.Shall update after using.Sharing pictures also of the older oven for a size perspective. Also the front and side photos of the oven racks.HB in blue is the rack on the Hamilton Beach.The build quality of the oven and the accessories look and feel good too. No regrets there",
