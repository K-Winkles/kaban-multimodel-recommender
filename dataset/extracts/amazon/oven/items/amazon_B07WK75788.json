You can also get the perfect slice of toast by selecting the shade you prefer. Easy to Clean You can keep the toaster oven clean with the convenient detachable crumb tray. Tilt the unit backwards slightly and push the dial on the tray towards the rear of the unit. The crumb tray will drop open and allow for cleaning. Dual Position Rack Place food right under the broiler or make room for large items. The upper position is typically for broiling while the lower position is best for baking and toasting. High and low oven rack positions provide the versatility to have great results for all foods.",

                "reviewText": "This replaces a countertop air fryer toaster oven that had computerized controls and was a complete PITA to use. We were so happy when it failed, which sent us back to hunt for a mechanical control version.We bought this particular machine because it has all manual controls, an on/off light switch that stays on until turned off and, BONUS, a rotisserie that has a basket, which we use to roast nuts and soy beans. Included are the usual pans, racks and air fryer basket, along with the rotisserie bar and its basket.The current huge Amazon discount also helped with our decision. We basically bought 2 for 1 when compared to a Cuisinart, which doesn't have the rotisserie basket and didn't last any longer than these imports. Our previous similar Cuisinart died after 2 years; given its cost we deemed it a delete.The controls are easy to read and straightforward. We also appreciate that it's not branded on the face with some weird, unintelligible name; it's not branded at all (thank you).The roasting basket works so well that we bought a second one of these as a back-up for the inevitable failure that looms in all of our futures...lol. We're vegan, so we'll never use the rotisserie for a chicken, but for all you conventional food lovers, the rotisserie really works.We only have a single nit and that is with the air fryer basket - it's too big to fit correctly into the drip pan, but it will drip into said pan when placed on a separate rack position. From our previous oven we have a slightly smaller air fryer basket that fits perfectly into the drip pan, but not everyone has all of these parts.We also find that toasting in any of these countertop ovens requires a different rack/pan, which is available in stainless here on Amazon - search for the \"Joyfair 12.5 inch baking pan\" with rack. It comes in different sizes to fit any countertop toaster/airfryer with a mesh rack instead of a straight wire rack.NB - read the manual for rack placement because it matters for correct cooking. We placed our morning millet crisp on the wrong rack and discovered that it wasn't toasted correctly - burnt on the edges and raw in the middle. We almost sent it back until we re-read the rack placement instructions. Aha! Toasting happens evenly on the middle rack placement as instructed. Duh-oh.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this small oven for my powder coating of small objects. I put it through the tests in the past 2 days and it functions as should be. The preheat is in minutes, temperatures are pretty accurate, as is the timer. I use a silicone cookie sheet cover on the flat plate to avoid any sticking from the powder coat, with perfect results. This oven is light enough to carry in one hand under the arm, so I would classify it as easily \"Portable\".The only negative would be the very short cord, meaning the manufacture wants it close to the outlet for amperage draw over the marginal cord gauge. Price is right, keeps me out of the wife's oven and out of trouble.",

                "reviewText": "Simple controls - there are knobs for temperature and timing. The printed nubmers are difficult to read because they are dim. 1 star off for that. Temperature control is good. I use this only for reheating, so I can't comment about its toasting capability.Interesting mechanism - as you open the door the metal grid is lowered and pulls out partially. This makes it easy to put in items and retrieve them. If you are using a vessel make sure its sides are not too high or it may hit the protective grid over the top heating element. There also is a second element on the bottom.One other thing: The tray that is included is quite small - 6\" x 9\" so you can only fit, for example, *one* slice of pizza on it.",

I am giving the toaster oven a 3 out of 5 because even though it works really well it is on the smaller side. Also the line does not come with differnet pans so you have to make sure when you are buying extra pans and racks that you pay close attention to the side. Also it has a setting for bake, toast and broil but the toast setting is not separate from the bake setting so you really have to watch what temp you have the \"oven\" set at when you are toasting something. Other than those minor things the product is great value for the money.",

I braced for the possibility that the inside could rust after it's first use like my last toaster from B&D did, but that didn't happen ! I've been using it every day since it arrived two weeks ago and it's staying clean. The other thing I like is that it heats evenly with no cold spots. Both heating elements stay a solid orange all the way across. The operation is simple and straight forward. It's so light weight that it feels cheap when you pick it up but when it's in place on the counter top it's door and rack operations are sturdy. One thing I noticed, when I first used it, the door didn't want to rest all of the way down when open. It wanted to spring back closed. So I very lightly forced it all of the way open where the handle rested on the counter when fully open. Nothing broke and it works like it should now. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.",
