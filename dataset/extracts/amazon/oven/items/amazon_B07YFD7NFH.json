It only takes a few minutes to preheat and it can bake two 12\" frozen pizza with added toppings just fine with room to spare between them. Its actually really pretty also. Jut like in the ad picture. The price was awesome. I got lucky and found it with a $30.00 off coupon. Made it $65.00. I'm going to try baking a whole chicken this afternoon on convection. I was looking for a Cuisinart, But I found this and for the price, I got a bargain and I love it. Plus it very easy to clean. It also comes with 2 racks and a cookie sheet. The mini cookie sheets are expensive just by themselves. This was a real bargain.. Plus its really awesome.",

It doesn't have a stop to prevent you from dumping everything on the floor. That picture with the shelf pulled all the way out? Not happening. I complained about this the first time, that's why this time 4-stars. Otherwise, the outside has taken a beating and still looks great. The convection fan still works, and the heating coils still get hot. This is after two teenagers not known for their cleaning ability.",

It wasn't long after that was decided we need something besides the stove, typical apartment oven and instant pot.Hello, Toaster Oven!This has worked quite well for us. The red is beautiful. It matches every red item I have asked my father for for Christmas (He doesn't realize over the years he has slowly been perfecting my Kitchen decor and items with these Christmas requests! ...but I digress).We needed something that worked like a microwave but...just wasn't. I don't have alot of counter space, so the fact I can make hot pockets, toast, pizza, cakes, etc all in one machine? I'm stoked! ....okay, yesy oven can do this but that takes more power and heats the kitchen way more in summer.Now, this little baby gets HOT. ...do NOT put anything on top while cooking... The Verve Buds charge box got heat warped... It melted a tea light......but! If you have those rolls that you have to let rise for a bit before cooking? Ermagod.... Perfect spot to put those babies. Put them on top and Pop the kids dino nuggets in and your golden...they rise a bit faster!We are a family of 5... ....the boys out number me... They eat alot.... 6 months of having it...I need the matching peices now....",

                "reviewText": "Wow. This is a great little convection toaster oven. Well...it's actually pretty big for a toaster oven. It is a perfect size for rolls, cornbread and cassaroles. I don't have a regular convection oven so this actually works better than my big electric oven. Less heat generated and less electricity used if I bake with this. Which is very nice in hot weather. If you want to bake actual standard size loaves of bread (2 will fit) remember to cover the tops with foil or they will burn because they're so close to the element. I kinda feel like a kid using my little easy bake oven.",

It's actually 12 in deep, 10.5 in high by 18.5 in wide. The vents are located on the sides so its good idea to have a few inches of space for it to breathe on both sides. Have only used it once so far but everything works great as advertised. Takes about 15 min to warm it up before you can start cooking. Looks great with our other red small appliances in kitchen.",
