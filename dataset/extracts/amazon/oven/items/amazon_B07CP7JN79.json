And since the door opens above the oven, It frees up your countertop space in front. Best of all, it\u2019s easy to keep clean Because food can\u2019t spill on the door. Contoured dials are easy to grip and turn, making it simple to switch between bake, broil and toast settings. The stay-on setting is safer thanks to a stop mechanism that prevents the knob from being turned to stay-on by accident.",

                "reviewText": "Like my first one so much that I bought another when my old one gave out and at this price buying two in 6 years is still cheaper than an expensive One. Even toasting, a couple spuds cook evenly etc. The door raises up all the way up and out of the way of the tray (and your wrist) so it's very easy to take hot tray out of oven. The door is held on with only one Phillips screw at each(not rickety) end so if you somehow get something burnt onto the door glass you can simply remove the door and soak in a tub of dish of soapy water and reinstall. Easy controls, true heat and timer, and very even heating and browning of things like four Texas toast sized garlic cheese slices., Not one over browned spot on the garlic bread. Smaller than my bread box which is a plus for me. I have a professional ( largest one can buy) oven, a large air fryer with rotisserie so I actually bought this to be my \"toaster\" oven lol. Performed well :)",

It doesn't take of counter top space & a plate can be put directly in front of the opening - because it opens like a garage door. It heats well, & toasts perfectly, even bagels. This is a great toaster ovens. Thanks Hamilton Beach! !",

                "reviewText": "After my toaster over with the slots on top and oven on the side started to malfunction, had a hard time finding a replacement as it was discontinued. My main purpose for it is to toast bread, waffles andheating up bagels (makes is easier to slice and then I toast them).After much research, decided on this model as it was the smallest size for my counter space and reviews looked pretty good; they did not disappoint!The Pros so far from my experience:* Rounded front door helps it take up a little less space than the traditional rectangle version, even visually less space.* Easier access to place/remove food from toaster oven with a wide opening when door is open.* Plenty of room for 4 breads/bagels. I only used for two at a time as in the photo.* Bake Pan, Oven Rack & Crumb Tray included.* Great option for when you don't want to use the conventional oven for cooking! (will update when I test this portion).* The Door Is Removable For Easy Cleaning. [Directions: Open the door, in the open position lift up to remove door for cleaning. reverse process to insert door back into toaster oven.]Con:* The instructions is off when it comes to temperature for toasting bread. Adjust according to your liking. The temperature used in this photo is 300 degrees; not the toast icon all the way in the end by 450 degrees (will be burnt toast). For bagels, I turn the knob down between 250 - about 275 degrees. That is all I can think of for con. Precautions:* Be Gentle With The Timer Knob: If you turn it on by mistake without plugging in first (as I already did, lol), wait for the timer to ding for finish. Then plug it in and restart the timer.Not worth risking breaking the mechanism trying to speed up to reset the timer knob.* Disconnect plug from outlet when not in use.* When finished toasting, wait a few seconds after opening the door (oven heats pretty good) to let the heat out and then remove the food.Happy with the purchase! Wonderful upgrade!",

Awesome for one person meals so I didn\u2019t have to use the huge oven, however after only 5-6 uses within 2 weeks the heating elements stopped working all together. The timer would work and be turned on however nothing would happen with the heating elements so I have returned it to Amazon.Pretty damn unimpressed a Christmas present lasted not even a month with minimal use for the price I paid.",
