                "reviewText": "I can't say enough good things about this oven! First of all it is amazingly quiet. It's got every feature you could want - toast, air fry, roast, rotisserie, dehydrate, pizza, dual function, and a bunch more. You can turn off the button sounds. The menu has actual words, and is very easy to use. The touch control is sensitive. It is well insulated and doesn't put off a ton of heat. The handle doesn't get hot at all. It is large enough to have a really good capacity on the interior, but it's not too massive on the countertop. You CAN actually rotisserie roast a 4-5 lb chicken in it! I cooked one that was just under 5 lbs last night, and it was delicious. The manual that comes with it is detailed and easy to understand. It makes great toast. It's reasonably easy to clean. It works quickly and efficiently. I previously had one of the first generation air fryers - the one that they sold on the infomercials. I had lots of problems with it. This over is leaps and bounds above that one. I've never heard of this brand before, but whoever designed this thing really put a lot of thought and work into making it excellent. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I love this toaster oven/air fryer, and literally haven't needed to use my regular oven since receiving this one, which has been over seven months (and one Thanksgiving dinner) now. It has so many easy to use features, pre-heats quickly, and is very quiet. My kitchen stayed cooler this summer, not having to heat up my full-sized gas oven.But even better than the product itself, was my exerience with their customer support department. I had placed my small dutch oven, which is quite heavy, on the wire rack and it made it sort of sag in the middle. On hindsight I should have used the solid baking pan to better support the weight.I went to purchase a new replacement rack on Amazon but didn't find one, so then went to Aeitto's website to look for one, but again didn't find one. So as a last resort measure, I contacted Customer Support and explained my issue.They were very responsive and professional and within days I received a replacement wire rack. I couldn't be more pleased and would highly recommend them.",

My husband and I air fry potatoes, roast veggies, bake fish filets and chicken breasts and proof breads and nut yogurts. It fits perfectly under our cabinets and doesn\u2019t get that hot on the outer surface of the oven as the description warns, so that\u2019s an added plus. I love the sleek design and super easy to use! Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I need a larger air fryer oven for all cooking/baking (I don't have a standard oven). The actual inner oven size is large enough to use my 9 X 11 casserole dishes and to cook a 12\" pizza (does GREAT pizza!). It heats up instantly, so no waiting. So far, this oven is easy to clean. I'm not sure if the innards are non-stick, but I just wipe off all parts after use and it's clean. Cooked 1/2 turkey for Thanksgiving , and it was the best we've had in years. It's sleek and not too big on the counter. If you want/need a larger air fryer oven, this one is great.",
