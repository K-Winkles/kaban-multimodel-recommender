I've only done a 12\" pizza, hot dogs, hamburger patties, and I make my own corn tortilla chips in it. Really beats my smaller toaster oven that I retired. Planning on doing cornbread soon. The fan is a tiny bit loud but doesn't bother me and only comes on on bake and convection. It's a lot like a real oven.",

                "reviewText": "Very nice overall. It only takes a couple minutes longer on bake mode for most items. Still learning the convection times a little bit. Toast mode is about spot on. Warm mode is okay so far. It\u2019s lighter than it looks. It\u2019s about 95% great for the cons of this oven. Only negative things for this oven is minimal. 1 the door does open a little lower than I like. 2 the font next to the buttons could be bolder. 3 it\u2019s a little lighter cooking on the front right side close to the door; so definitely rotate if need be. 4 my rack times bent a little on the first seasoning of it and it could come with 2 racks instead of one. That\u2019s it for the negatives and easy enough to deal with honestly. Easy to clean if you clean after each use. Works really well so far.Here\u2019s the best tip I\u2019ll give you. It says to run it at full 450 degrees for 20 minutes before use. From other reviews I did not do this. I ran it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and it worked great. No odors and it saved my rack from bending more I believe. I use this more than my main oven now as it\u2019s easier and quicker to cook most smaller to medium items. If cooking a pizza on a pan I recommend 3-4 minutes longer but watch the top of it as well. Potatoes whole takes about 10 minutes longer. Very happy overall. 4.3 stars!",
