                "reviewText": "This was my first year making the turkey and overall it went great using this roaster. With a larger turkey it can take some finagling (will do better tying of the legs next time) to prevent parts from touching the side as it cooks and opens up. Worked great right on the counter top, definitely cooks turkey faster than expected so shave maybe 20-30% of the time you would typically cook. I was worried it wouldn't create a nice crispy skin but it does! Great purchase overall, worth the price.",

I've tried many ways to cook large turkeys and this is by far the best. Rubbed it with EVO and poultry seasoning, good amount of pepper and then, for color, smoked paprika. Came out perfect.Highly recommend. Only downside is no on light but that's only a personal preference. Good, basic roaster oven like our mom and grandma used.",

                "reviewText": "Con: Wish it had a temp light that goes off when internal temp reaches the set temp.Pro: I would give this oven 5 stars except for the light. Very portable, keep the original box. Retains heat very well. I only use it twice or three times a year for turkeys. I have used the oven outside in 20 degree weather. Cooks evenly. This is my second type of oven. Last one lasted 15 years.",
