                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Works great!",
                "reviewText": "I've had this toaster oven for about a month now and, after doing some scavenger hunting on the internet for instructions and a little trial and error, I think it's going to pretty much replace my regular gas oven.Let me save you a little frustration as to the lack of instructions, especially pertaining to the convection feature. If you select the \"Bake\" setting, the convection feature is activated. There is no way to turn it off, which is actually fine.What I have discovered is, if I'm baking baked goods (cookies, muffins, etc) you need to decrease the baking temperature by 25 degrees or reduce the baking time by about 25 %, or both. If you reduce the temp, start checking for doneness about 3/4 of the way through the baking process.If I'm baking a casserole, which contains more liquids or the like('cream of' soups, eggs, cheese, etc) I use the recommended temperature in the recipe and let it cook the full amount of time. I made a tuna noodle casserole last week and it was perfect using the recipe exactly as written.I haven't used the broil feature for meat yet, so I don't have a point of reference for that feature and, as I'm single and just make toast in a regular 2 slice toaster, I also don't have a review for the toast feature (I don't need 8 slices of toast at once.)What I LOVE about this oven is being able to use my regular pans! I had a smaller toaster oven before and got frustrated by having to buy special pans for it. I ended up buying a lot of disposable aluminum pans. With this oven, I can use all of my regular pans (I have several Pampered Chef ones that I wasn't able to use in the old toaster oven) except for a couple of my larger baking stones. So far, everything has baked so much more evenly than in my full sized gas oven that I'm absolutely thrilled.So, as far as the way the oven functions and the results I've had when cooking with it, I am very satisfied with this oven. The only negative comment that I have about it is that the instructions are almost non-existent. An individual shouldn't have to do 2 hours of research online and watch youtube videos to learn how to properly use this product. They really need to include an actual instruction manual, with a few recipes included for each feature of the oven, instead of a big sheet of pitiful basic instructions that are written in about a dozen different languages. I think that most of the negative reviews that I've seen could have been avoided if this were the case. Does the outside of the oven get hot? Yes, it's a toaster oven, not an insulated range, so move it away from the wall. The crumb tray slides into the slots underneath the OUTSIDE of the oven, it doesn't go inside and I believe this is the reason that so many people are saying it never gets hot enough. The convection feature comes on and stays on when baking, there's no way to shut it off. All of this could should be explained in an actual instruction manual.My last comment pertains to the price. At $67 in November, this oven was a great value. Less than a month later, it's $96!!!! Had it been this price originally, I'm not sure I would have purchased it.So, my review is A for the the oven itself, D for the lack of instructions and the $30 price hike just before Christmas.",

                "reviewText": "I wish the crumb tray slid out as the old one did, but the controls are the same (easy and accurate once you learn to use them) and it is perfect for my toast, bagels, and heated pizza and appetizers. The small size is good for my limited counter space--I just don't have room for a convection oven type.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice, very basic toaster oven and for the low price, this is about what you should expect. It has a small footprint, so it works well in a small kitchen with limited counter space. That small footprint translates into a small oven cavity so forget about baking a cake in there. A couple of medium potatoes will fit fine (but see 3 below). The temperature control seems reasonably accurate.A few of negatives (again, consider the price): 1) non-adjustable rack; one position in the middle of the oven. 2) tiny markings on the dials; turn on the overhead kitchen lights and start squinting to see the markings. 3) that non-adjustable rack and small cavity size brings the top of the food very close to the upper heating element, so keep an eye on those large potatoes so they don't burn on top. 4) the timer goes only to 30 minutes; not enough time to bake a potato. So keep an eye on it so you can crank the timer around again when it shuts off after 30 minutes. 5) the exterior does get quite hot, so give other things on your counter some clearance.Definitely not an all purpose do-it-all, but for the price a quite serviceable appliance to bake your potatoes, make some toast, toast an english muffin or bagel (use the broil setting) or bake some frozen french fries.",

                "reviewText": "Well I love it first off, I am primarily using it to toast bread and if I need to do something else I may. And sure I could\u2019ve gotten a regular toaster but we don\u2019t even have a microwave and so going back in forth between getting a microwave, toaster, or air fryer I felt like for me this toaster oven or convection oven just makes everything easier for me, as my husband isn\u2019t big on breakfast and would eat toast with butter the majority of the time, don\u2019t get me wrong he loves my cooking he just can\u2019t eat specific foods due to his condition, but thats besides the point, the reason for my title is well I used it this morning for toasting bread and nearly burnt the bread! I read the directions and left the kitchen momentarily, it definitely took less then \u201c10 mins\u201d as described in the yellow note provided with the instructions, either I wasn\u2019t using my brain or it was just one of those days but I did read those directions, but you know you learn as you go I love it so far, and hopefully will remain that way. Provided some pictures.",

I\u2019ve had multiple toasters across the years, and they never seem to get it right! Under toasted, over toasted. You can\u2019t see how the toasting is going, so you pop it up, put it down, etc. With this unit I can actually SEE what is going on! Toasted beautifully on both top and bottom every time. The other day I tried frozen waffels. Way better than the toaster. Funny thing is that is actully cheaper than the toaster I just tossed out. Highy recommend if you want a good toaster. Everything else is a bonus!",
