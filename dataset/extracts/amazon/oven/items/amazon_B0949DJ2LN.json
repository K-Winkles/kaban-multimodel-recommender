                "reviewText": "First of all let me get this out of the way: This is not in any way, shape or form an air fryer. It is, however, a very nice toaster oven. Controls are a bit complex to use. Very easy to clean. Large capacity. I easily fit a rectangular Totino's pizza in it and used the \"Air Fryer\" option. It actually took longer to cook than normally, but the result was a perfectly done pizza with a great crisp crust. And I didn't have to heat up my kitchen with my big oven.",

                "reviewText": "2nd oven I've ordered, different brand before, arrived with 3 dents. Returned.This arrived in wet box. See pictures. Oven is ok so far. Packaged very well had to have help getting out of box packaged so tightly and well.All components included and fit correctly. Glass door moves up and down smoothly.Unit does get overly warm outside and could burn skin. But handle doesn't. Plug is short, works for me but maybe not some kitchens. Dials work smoothly and are clear. Followed instructions and pre heated to remove new smell, wasn't a strong odor. Washed pans and basket in hot soapy water as instructed. Just received it 2 days ago. I'll send new review after some use. I'm 85 and bought to cook toast, warm leftovers and not have to use my big oven. Thinking HB has improved quality from older bad reviews several years ago.I'll see as I use it.",

It works perfectly for toasting and baking so far. Appears to be easy to clean. And I LOVE the roll up door, which not only frees up counter space for access, but makes access much easier. Very pleased with this purchase. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I will cut to the chase: this is not an air fryer, just a convection oven. I used it to air fry potatoes and chicken drumsticks. The potatoes came out a little soggy after 40 minutes, similar to results from convection baking. The chicken drumsticks also lacked crispness, again more like convection baking. The bake and toast functions work well. The timer is however limited to 30 minutes so you will need to reset the timer if you need more than 30 minutes. The dials are rotary and lacked precise markings for accurate settings. The interior space is ample though, and more than adequate for a 12\" pizza. The price is right for a good toaster and convection oven. However, if you want a truly good air fryer, look elsewhere and prepare to pay more.",
