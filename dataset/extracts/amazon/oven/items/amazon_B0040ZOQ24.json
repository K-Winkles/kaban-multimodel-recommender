But it works so SO well. I did the warm clean option on our old oven in our rental house (so it\u2019s probably never been cleaned before like ever). I wish I had taken a before picture, but I at least have an after picture. It\u2019s not perfect, but looks exponentially better than it did before. I did have to wipe clean with a wet towel and then behind that a dry towel, and had to do this multiple times to ensure all the product was gone. If I didn\u2019t it left like white streaks. I think I used too much though. Anwyas, I highly recommend! Just make sure you open a window and get a mask before using, because this stuff cannot be good to breathe in lol",

                "reviewText": "Although my oven has a 'Self Clean\" function, I've read about some owners having failure issues with their ovens after using the feature due to the extremely high temperatures of the Self-clean damaging some of the internal wiring/electronics in the oven. With my oven on it's 16th year, I thought I'd try Easy-Off versus risking damaging my oven and, \"Wow,\" I'm impressed. Following the directions, I sprayed the oven and let it sit for 15 minutes. The bulk of the burnt greased cleaned up after the first application. A few stubborn areas I sprayed again and let sit for 30 minutes, and they cleaned up, as well. The other benefit of the Easy-Off versus Self-Clean, is that the Easy-Off allows you to clean the door edges that won't clean up with a Self-clean option. Very happy with the results.",

                "reviewText": "We absolutely loved this product for cleaning our oven! We hadn't cleaned the oven since we moved in horrible I know! Bottom of the oven was black and we considered using the self cleaning feature on the oven but were concerned w fumes and maybe catching fire.We sprayed on and wiped after 30 min. Amazing how much had come off then. Agree if your oven is super dirty like ours was it worked best to spray it before bed and then leave overnight. I did have to give certain areas a second of cleaning. But it looked like a brand new oven when we got done with minimal elbow grease and work. We should have used this product years ago! Only thing to be sure is you wipe all product clear as we did notice white areas after drying where we hadn't wiped it all clear. Otherwise amazing and everyone needs to add this to their household supply list.",

                "reviewText": "I recently moved out of my place of 14 years. Thru the years I had lot of roomates, and cleaning was always more difficult with other people adding. My oven has always suffered under used of people that never clean it. I haven't used my oven for some years, as I'm not a baker, but when i was moving out I realized how bad and dirty it was inside. So much layers of grime! I bought this product after watching some YouTube video for best over cleaning products! And wow! This cleaned 14 years of grime like nothing! I had to do it few times, which was understandable after so many years! But after few days of repeat and scrubs the oven looked like new inside! Couldn't even believe it! So, then I decided to use the spray for my Air Fryer pan that I inherited for free and was very brown instead of chrome. And just one soak and scrub the air fryer pan is silver again!",

I did use a scouring pad, but it certainly came up cleaner and a lot quicker than other products I have used in the past. No messy bag or leaving it overnight either. I would recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "Have tried several other products for removing burned on stains to the textured glass surface of a combined microwave / convection oven turntable. The textured finish meant that conventional cleaning just wiped over the stains which were recessed into the fine \"dimples\" of the surface. I even resorted to taking it outside and using my pressure washer to try blasting it to removing the marks but nothing worked.Finally tried this and all I can say is that it's amazing stuff... spray on, leave for a few minutes and wipe off it was as simple as that. I had to do a couple off applications to get rid of the more stubborn stains but considering what I had tried previously this stuff is simply miraculous.",
