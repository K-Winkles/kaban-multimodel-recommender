                "reviewText": "We've only had this Brio for a few weeks, but I'm loving it so far. It cooks much faster than our previous air fryer (different brand). The presets are GREAT - I like having a few of those memorized so I can just punch the buttons a couple of times without having to give it much thought, and then can adjust time or temp as needed. I loving having the light, too. I also like being able to see the food as it cooks, which I couldn't do with our previous air fryer.We bought the round drum rotisserie basket later, but I'm not sure we'll use it very often. So far, I've used it 3 or 4 times, thinking it would get easier with familiarity, but I think the trays will do the same thing without the hassle, so I'm not sure that extra was worth the expense. But the Brio oven itself - yes, definitely worth it.Used the flat rotisserie basket (included with the oven) to cook some Italian sausage links, and LOVED it. It's easier to use than the drum, so we'll use it regularly.All the trays and baskets go in the dishwasher, which makes for quick and easy clean up.",

                "reviewText": "This is a pretty good little grilling cookerIt's easy to use and clean, and with a bunch of time and temperature settings you can easily air grill all kinds of meat and other foods, not like any stove or grillIt doesn't heat up the house or smoke up the place like a regular oven would and with the timer you just set it and it turns it's self off, so that's makes cooking easyWith that DCVIRUS in 19 our bodies do better with more protein foods is my thoughts so I got it to help lose weight by eating more good protein grilled meatsThe draw backs of the black unit is that it's too tall to fit under a counter and needs 3 inches of room around it so, I took the electric burners out of 2 spots on the stove and put it there, but you might need a separate table or other to put it on, or think about getting the other silver nuwave model that looks like it would fit on a counter but under the cabinets.6 muffin pan fits good and are easy to make and cook so yummy muffins and biscuitsIt cooks didn't than a stove so for recipes that call for 400 degrees you probably need to turn it down to 360 degrees and for less time.I am pretty happy with it so far as I had the first round nuwave cooker for years, but didn't like cleaning it and this unit seams to do a much better job and a lot easier to use, and clean so I am using it every day.I put 3 to 5 eggs on a glass plate and put it in on 300 degrees for 10 minutes or so with some cheese on top and it turns out pretty good and I don't have to stand at the stove as it turns it's self off afterwardsHopefully it will hold up well like there earlier models that I have had for many years.When grilling meats I spray the meats with coconut oil spray first because I think it helps shear the food and the flavor stays in the meats better is my thoughtsI had it now for about a month and used it several times a day and it's fun and easy to use, and I bought it for better healthy foods, and post virus cooking needs",

                "reviewText": "Good product...will only hold a small whole chicken....had 2 chickens....5.1lbs and 6.7lbs. The 6.7lbs did not fit. Also design of the air fryer DOES NOT fit under standard cabinets on countertop so for me to use I have to use it on my dining room table because it is 1/4 inch too high to fit on my counter top. I guess I could place on top of my stovetop but it defeats the purpose of being a household item. Another issue....the heat comes from the top so cooking pizza will not work unless you want hard crispy topping and burnt cheese. I have an older version of NUWAVE to where I can set the top heat lower so my toppings don't burn....this NUWAVE is a major step back for size and cooking ability but does have the rotisserie which works well for tiny chicken or hens or fish. Something that I have always wanted. I have 28 more days and I am leaning toward returning it as it will not fit under my cabinets under my cabinets which is a major disappointment. What a shame. I guess the design team didn't think about it fitting on the countertop. To use it you will need an kitchen island or your dining room table as it will not fit on countertops because it is too tall.",

                "reviewText": "At first, I was so frustrated about the use of the oven, that I almost returned it. I don't use the program function, it is too confusing. Just turning it on, adjusting the time and temp is all I need. The probe is amazing and enables me to cook everything to perfection. Food comes out with a crunchy, golden brown with flaky soft insides. French fries are incredible. I cook my tri-tip in my Brio and it comes out with a perfect \"crust\" and juicy insides. It's so easy to clean, the door even comes off so it can be washed under water. When I washed the exterior, the letters came off. I contacted the company and they immediately sent me a template to place over the other control panel and that fixed it. I love, love, love my Brio",
