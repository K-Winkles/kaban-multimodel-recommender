It takes up a lot of counter space but has the biggest cooking space of the combo air fryer toaster ovens that we looked at. I'm very pleased with it and would highly recommend it.It probably isn't the best for baking as tops don't get quite as brown or golden as they do in a traditional oven, but certainly works very well for roasting vegetables and if you don't need things to be pitch or perfect, it does cook very well, even if the tops don't brown quite as well.I have made cookies, meat, vegetables, dehydrated herbs for my guinea pigs, and done many of the things in this oven and I am extremely pleased with it and very happy with my purchase.",

I then did some research and found more positive reviews than negative ones. I saw one in a store and it didn't look as cheesy as it did on TV. So I though I'd give it a try.I bought this last April and have enjoyed using it almost every day and sometimes several times a day. It cooks almost everything. The features are easy to set. From making toast to cooking a whole chicken with the Temperature Sensor.. Works Great!The only thing I have an issue with is the cleaning. This can be a big undertaking, especially if you have room mates that use it too. The Air Fry basket gets pretty Funky if you fry coated chicken in it. The Trays clean up easily. The inside of the oven gets pretty greasy fast. With the amount of use at my house, I need to clean it about a month. I would highly recommend this!",

                "reviewText": "Yes, it is a little big and yes air-fry sounds like a jet taking off, but this thing really does the job. My Breville finally burned out the convection fan after years of daily use. It was great, but I took a chance on this one and have been very pleased. It has a large capacity and the fan at the back seems to cook more evenly. Also, I like the controls on the handle which save space. While the stainless steel racks are nice, it would be good to have a non-stick basket. I bought one from Amazon that is much easier to clean. I also bought some liners for the bottom that go in the dishwasher. Overall I am very happy and feel this is a good value.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using the Ninja Foodi Grill (model AG302 JM1) for several years, but we needed something closer to a convection oven for the kitchen of our small business. The Ninja DT201 convection oven was the right size with enough functions, and it is 1800 W compared to 1760 W for the AG302. I directly compared them by separately cooking French fries and salmon filets for 4 people. The AG302 gives excellent results using the basket for the fries and the grill for the salmon. The DT201 oven potentially could cook both the fries and the salmon together, but I wanted a fair comparison. The fries and salmon were cooked properly in about the same time in the DT201, but the AG302 gave better results because of its design. The biggest difference was the fries because I didn't use any oil on the them due to the lack of a containment tray for the wire rack of the DT201. That resulted in dry fries with little browning, which are great for a low-fat diet. Fortunately I added salt before cooking them, so the flavor was ok. I'll probably try to find a tray that fits under the wire rack to see if it's possible to get better results using olive oil. The only difference for the salmon was that the DT201 oven didn't get the sear that the AG302 grill creates, which would probably be more of an issue for beef. Note that the cooking temperature and instructions for both the DT201 and AG302 are not very useful for most things. The recommended shelf position in the DT201 oven is not ideal, and the cooking time is either too short (for the fries) or way too long (for the salmon) for both the DT201 and AG302. Therefore, checking the food is necessary until you learn what works best. Fortunately the oven has a glass door that makes it very easy to check the food as it cooks. The oven racks, wire tray, and other accessories fit the DT201 oven properly, were sturdy, and could be easily cleaned. Overall it's a reasonably good oven that should work well along with the induction burner and microwave oven in our small kitchen that does not have a full-size oven/range.",

Controls are easy to use.Be careful of falling food hitting and staying on the bottom heating element. Ex: cheese from frozen pizza. We put one of the trays lined with foil on lowest level to catch bits that fall off.On air fry it can be a little bit loud but that is too be expected.You can cook on two levels but watch closely as the racks will cook at slightly different rates.",

                "reviewTitle": "A Phenomenal Countertop Convection Oven Replacing our Full Size Oven!!",
                "reviewText": "Our main oven stopped working, and when we were faced with the decision of replacing it, especially in the current pandemic climate, we were a bit stuck on what to do. Should we brave going out into an appliance store to look at a new full size oven? Then go through the process of having the new full size oven delivered into our home? We decided against this and looked into a temporary solution that would tide us over for potentially the next 6 months to a year, and here enter the Ninja Foodi 10-in-1 Air Fry Digital Countertop Convection Oven!We have been using the oven for about a month at this point, and this product has completely exceeded our expectations! It literally pre-heats in under 1 minute to temperatures around 425 F, which easily is 5 to potentially 10 times faster than our full size oven when it was working optimally! That alone cuts down considerably on cooking and prep times when it\u2019s come to family meals! The size of the countertop oven is also incredible, obviously being not as large as a full size oven, but more than adequate for every meal we have been cooking over the past month for our family of 3!It\u2019s also incredibly easy and intuitive to use, my 3 year old loves to help push the buttons to commence cooking, and if we let him know the Mode, Cooking Temp and Time, even he knows how to get everything started and cooking every time successfully (always with our supervision of course)!I\u2019ve read some of the negative reviews, and I can state that yes, the oven fan does make noise, but it is hardly enough to be considered \u201ctoo noisy\u201d. It\u2019s not silent or super quiet, but it\u2019s definitely no louder than a normal microwave.Also, some negative reviews have stated the oven is difficult to clean due to the design of the heating elements. I can understand this if food splatter or crumbs build up at the bottom of the oven, but after a month of use, we have not had very much mess result from our cooking, but I\u2019m sure with more use we will encounter some cleaning challenges. We actually just use one of the provided cooking pans placed on the bottom rack for any items we cook directly on the third rack, and this has been able to catch any falling food debris keeping the bottom quite clean. In this way, I feel much of the criticisms can either be easily overcome, or aren\u2019t as bad as some of the more negative focused reviews are making it sound.Overall, this product is becoming one of our most essential and most used kitten items in our household, which says a lot of an item we were only initially looking to purchase to temporarily substitute for our full size oven. To be honest, we\u2019re now only using our full size oven for its stove top, which still works, and we may just continue to use the Ninja Foodi 10-in-1 Air Fry Digital Countertop Convection oven as our primary family home oven for the foreseeable future! Even when we get the option to replace our full size oven, which to our family, says a whole lot about the quality and genuine worth of this product! So highly recommended, and I\u2019m also now very excited to look at other Ninja Foodi products to add to our kitchen collection!",
