But the important thing is that I noticed it about 2 weeks into use. It\u2019s bothersome from a safety in cleaning ( it could produce a slight scratch or cut to the finger), durability (what will it look like in 12 months?) and also food hygiene (can bits of glass be mixed with my food at some point?)I called Amazon Customer Service (CS) and they put me through to the manufacturers chat (CS) who the said I bought Asurion warranty. That whole process although easy to type took way too long in real life. Anyway, I\u2019m yet to call Asurion and see what they offer.Re flavour - not sure how this is relevant to the appliance but I didn\u2019t notice a loss or enhancement if flavour.",

My wife loved the FW so being so similar, it should cook equally well. we also have the braun air fryer but the braun does not have a large enough cooking area but does fries, steaks, chops very well. all of these convection ovens use quartz halogen bulbs which are a pain to replace as the screws get distorted over time. we will continue to use the FW bowel as it is much thicker but over all my wife just loves these type of ovens. I like not running the oven during peak hydro times... convection ovens do save you time and money to cook or reheat your food. strongly recommended. 4 stars as the bowel is thinner which may or may not be an issue. lower price than the FW is a +++",
