If you're looking for \"the one\" I can't recommend this one enough.I've had it for around 4 months, using it multiple times a week. The non-stick coating is still perfect, and this makes it so easy to clean. It's thick and sturdy, and won't deform in the over like other pans. I've never had an issue with any discoloring, even after scrubbing off burned on food!Also, the little ridges on this pan make food more crispy! What an unexpected and delightful benefit :)",

                "reviewText": "I had been looking for a nonstick baking sheet to reduce my use of aluminum foil. I found it. This pan works great. It\u2019s recommended not to use cooking spray because the film can build up and take away the effectiveness of the nonstick. Even better. We cooked salmon the other night and with no spray, no foil, it cooked perfectly and did not stick! Washing is easy-simple wipe with a sponge and warm water\u2026I don\u2019t use the dishwasher. During the first use, it buckled but then resumed the normal shape and never buckled again. It\u2019s perfect and worth the money. Highly recommended!!",

                "reviewText": "The OXO Good Grips Non-Stick Pro sheet pan is awesome! I use it mainly for roasting meats and veggies. I can get great crispy skin on chicken with this pan. Roasted potatoes get great color. The pan cleans up in a snap. No need for scrubbers or scouring. Just brush off stuck on food, hand wash, and the pan looks like new! I don't get any residue.The pan does warp under heat (which is typical of most pans like this), but the shape returns once it cools down.Overall, this is the best sheet pan I have ever used.",
