                "reviewText": "Ok here's the deal I have had 2 toaster ovens before I got this one. The first was some off brand (cheap) worked until the glass door kept sticking/jamming but I could open it then one day it jammed so bad I jerked it open and the glass busted in a ton of pieces. The 2nd one I ordered came and it was Proctor Silex but I didn't use it was too small and seemed cheap made. I exchanged it for this Hamilton Beach love of my life toaster oven hahaha Let me tell you if you don't buy this one you really messed up! This bad boy is awesome! I have used it a few times and wow now I know what a toaster oven is supposed to be. I could go on and on but I'm telling you nothing cheap about it, works great, love the lift up door and FYI someone said it's a little hard to clean that would be a no. I'm a man with big hands and it was no problem cleaning the glass door. Sorry to ramble buy for that kind of money I want you to know it's worth it. Thank you Hamilton Beach.",

                "reviewText": "The best thing I like about this oven is the roll back door. Not a lot of whistles and bells - It's your basic \"Plain\" appliance, but it works great. The timer was a bit of a surprise because it only goes up to 30 minutes, which means, if I want to bake an item longer I need to make sure I hear the timer go off to reset additional time for cooking an item that takes longer. It is compact and that is a great thing for a small kitchen. However, I can still cook or warm up a good size pizza. It is very easy to clean and it looks good on the counter. And, it fits my cooking needs.",

                "reviewText": "We have had this toaster oven now for about 11/2 months. It fits nicely in a relatively small space and looks nice. The fact that the contents are slanted away from you and its unique hinged opening due to its design makes it less likely that you will burn yourself when taking toast, etc., out of the unit. It also uses 1400 watts making it acceptable for the average 15 amp household wiring. Those toaster units that are for example 1800 watts (above 1500 watts) need a 20 amp electrical line, which is probably not available in the average older household causing possible wire and electrical outlet overheating. The unit is simple to operate (a plus for my wife who does not like complexity). Note that this unit gets hot so the power cord should not be touching the back of the unit. So far we are pleased with this toaster oven.",

I took a chance on this model as I like the ability to cook a small frozen pizza in this.It's pretty easy to clean and just as easy to use. Sure, it takes up a little more space, but worth it. The way it cooks a Screaming Sicilian frozen pizza is awesome and evenly baked! I have even made a small batch of stuffed shells that turned out pretty good.I sure hope this is a long lasting toaster oven, I really like it.",

THE CRUMB TRAY AND BOTTOM CLEAN OUT TRAY COME OUT WITH EASE. I HAVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND MY HANDS LOVE TO \"DANCE\" SO I NEVER KNOW WHEN THEY MIGHT GIVE ME A LITTLE JUMP...WITH THIS SUPER TOASTER OVEN I AM NEVER NERVOUS WHEN I COOK WITH IT!! I MUST SOUND CRAZY BECAUSE I'M GOING ON ABOUT THIS TOASTER OVEN, BUT I TRULY FEEL SAFE USING IT. LOOKS GREAT ON MY COUNTER WITH EASY TO USE CONTROLS, HONESTLY CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? SERIOUSLY, HAVING SOMETHING IN THE KITCHEN THAT ISN'T DIGITAL IS A HUGE BREATH OF FRESH AIR. NO BEEPS, OR SLIPS WITH MY HANDS SETTING THE WRONG TIME, OR SHUTTING IT OFF!...NICE ROUND KNOBS TO TURN EASY AND I CAN SEE AND CLEAN THEM EASILY. I WISH ALL KITCHEN APPLIANCES WOULD HAVE GREAT DESIGNS LIKE MY LITTLE OVEN IT TRULY MAKES MY LIFE EASIER JUST WITH THE LITTLE OVEN THAT COULD!! \ud83d\ude1d. \ud83d\ude0a MY REVIEW IS SO LONG NO ONE WILL BOTHER TO READ IT..

Arrived new without a scratch in a random box, with nothing missing, so it was a good deal.My main use is as a countertop oven, and it works well for that, and heats better than the 31512C even without convection, but I'm not sure I'd be happy if I mostly used it for toast, which takes longer than indicated on the timer. Can't store unused trays on top of the oven because the door swings up and over, however it's easy on counter space for that reason, so evens out.Main concern is the recommendation to unplug it after each use, which isn't practical for me, as it's plugged in behind the fridge. #YOLO",
