                "reviewText": "This review is for the GOTHAM STEEL Ceramic Nonstick Pot with Lid (Color - Cream White, Capacity - 5 Quarts). I received a free taxable sample of this pot to review in my search for functional nonstick cookware.The pot arrived wrapped in a branded and decorated cardboard sleeve with a set of instructions taped to the sleeve. If gifting this pot, I recommend placing it in a gift bag with a tag and tissue paper. The pot is fairly thin and lightweight at 788 grams and has a circular base of 8\" that then rises 5\" to an outer diameter of 8 3/4\". There are two small protruding spouts on opposite ends of the top rim, and the bottom of the pot has a circular grooved disc of shiny metal that appears to be aluminum. The handles are an interesting mostly plastic construction attached to short metal arms secured to the sides of the pot and which have a twisting knob mechanism that secures the lid in place. The accompanying lid weighs 458 grams and measures 8 1/2\" in diameter on the bottom rim with a depth of 1\" and a top diameter of 9 1/4\". There is a metal handle set into the top of the lid that rises 1\" from the glass top. Two sizes (11x medium, 24x small) of strainer hole groups are built into opposite ends of the lid which roughly measure 2\" x 3/4\".As tested, the nonstick properties of the pot were quite good with an easy release for food and the overall capacity at the brim was 5 quarts. I was surprised by the lighter weight of the pot, but so far it has heated up quite easily and durability of the metal portions has not been a concern. Based on experience with other ceramic cookware, my only concern about the ceramic is that it will turn slightly off color and lose most of its nonstick properties over time. My other concern is for the plastic handles which I'm not sure will hold up to a direct flame even though the digital product literature suggests that this is oven safe (which I did not put to the test). My main dislikes for the handles are their thin clicky noise and somewhat cheap feel as I would have preferred metal handles with a more solid feel. Outside of those concerns, I did like the convenience of having the two sizes of strainer holes built into the lid as well as the option to not use the lid for straining (for noodles, I typically use a stainless-steel spaghetti server). The drainage speed isn't exactly the fastest, so I would recommend first pouring out the bulk of the liquid without the lid and then using the lid to strain the final portion.All in all, this pot is quite sturdy with a nice look and good nonstick functionality. I recommend this as a decent option for a functional nonstick ceramic pot, but also recommend seeing if there are similar options with metal handles.",
