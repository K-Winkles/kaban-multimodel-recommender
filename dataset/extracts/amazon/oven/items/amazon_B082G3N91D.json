                "reviewText": "I was considering this oven and the Breville Smart Pro Countertop oven (which surprisingly was less expensive, even if marginally so) and finally decided on the Calphalon for two reasons: first, I have a cat who sits on top of the microwave in the kitchen so she can stare at the dog when he eats and I was concerned she'd jump on a countertop oven while in use and give herself a nasty burn. The cool touch feature on this oven won me over.Second, I bake bread year round and in the summer my gas range really heats up my kitchen. When I saw the step cook function with proof/bake I was completely sold and ordered it (and yes, a 9x5 bread pan with a lip on both ends fits easily in this oven.)Another big plus was the interior light. Not many of these countertop ovens feature it but it's important to be able to check on the progress of your food without opening the door and letting out heat.The build just screams quality. The finish is beautiful and the Calphalon logo on the (very solid) handle as well as on the top of the unit shows attention to detail. The door glides open and shut quietly and doesn't clang or rattle. Even the included accessories look fairly high in quality. And it looks elegant in my kitchen and not trashy like the old toaster ovens always did. I have it on a finished wood kitchen island and to avoid scorching the wood I have a thick silicone mat underneath it. It preheats quickly and all of the various functions work well.By the way, I've made french fries in it using the dehydrator basket and the oven set to Turbo Convection and the fries turned out crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. It actually does a better job than my air fryer, although obviously I wouldn't put something like wings in this basket. But for fries it's great.If I have a quibble it's the utterly inadequate user manual that's included. It's more of a pamphlet than an actual user manual and it tells you in the (one page) of densely written text that forms the actual user manual portion of this pamphlet that if you need further usage instructions to go to their website. Seriously? It doesn't even cover one of the unique and most important features advertised on this oven, the step cook function, and I'm supposed to scrabble around on Calphalon's website to find this information? Not acceptable to make the consumer hunt for instructions that should be included with the oven. I want a full manual in hand and not this cheaply produced pamphlet. Calphalon, do better.",

                "reviewText": "This was a no-brainer buy. I hope the industry follows what Calphalon is doing now. The product is similarly priced as other top of the line units but with a few great differences. 1) The insulated exterior - sides and front. Much better heat conduction within and much safer around the family. The bottom and back get hot. The top eventually gets a bit hot but much safer with all the insulation. 2) The unit is very quiet! 3) Proofing! Wow, finally a countertop unit that maintains 90 degrees to proof yeast and is definitely used to maintain 90 degrees to allow dough to rise. 4) The reheat option works well. I was able to reheat a cheese quesadilla in 9 minutes at 350 degrees. 5) Very adjustable temperature control. 6) No doors to slam closed. This units downward swing door is weighted well. You remain in full control of the opening and closing for your own safety! 7) Yes, for safety, this unit has a two foot electrical cord. This is standard and safe practice. 8) The plug does not get hot during use. 9)There is a fan that runs for a period of time to cool the unit, if necessary, after use. 10) Yes, unplug it for safety. 11) Removable bottom tray for crumb disposal. 12) Adjustable rack - two positions. 13) Preheating to 400 degrees is quick - maybe 4 minutes. 14) The thermostat is accurate to within industry standards. My ancient oven thermometer measured 380 degrees when this unit was set to 400. The controls allow you to adjust the temperature should you want to be picky about that. 15) A three year warranty! Oh yeah!THE DRAWBACKS 1) The pizza pan in not vented on the bottom. It is of fine quality though. 2) It takes a long time to toast bread. 3) This thing is bigger than your standard cheapo toaster/oven. Measure and make sure you have enough vent space on top, back and sides per manufacturers instructions. 4) Weight is around 30 pounds.",

                "reviewText": "I told my husband we needed a new toaster oven. He told me he ordered one and this BEAST showed up! At first, I was really upset. This thing is huge! (You can see my Instant Pot on the right in the photo to get a size idea). I thought this will be a massive eyesore on our kitchen counter! But, we managed to put it in a corner so you cannot even see it from most places. Then I got to use it. The instructor manual is ridiculously lacking (it\u2019s basically a trifold brochure). But thankfully, it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out. It preheats FAST! It\u2019s easy to adjust cooking time whether it\u2019s toasting bread, toasting a bagel or baking a burrito! I definitely like it! It\u2019s preferable to use over our regular oven since it heats up fast and is the perfect size for our small families needs. If you have plenty of counter space, I\u2019d definitely recommend this!",

Does not get hot on top or sides but the back of unit gets pretty hot. Keep away from the wall. Works very well, very pleased, definitely recommend. Easy to use, the beeps are loud, not real loud which is a plus. If someone is dissapointed in this item, I wouldn't understand why. I used it for many items and comes out delicious. So much better than using the oven. I wished I would of purchased this a long time ago!",

The top was warmer than the sides, but nowhere near how hot traditional toaster ovens get.The unit is bulky, but feels solid, and pricy; but definitely worth the cost, especially with little kids around the house.Other than the cool touch feature, it's a standard convention toaster oven (no air fryer capabilities).",

                "reviewText": "I also own the previous model, and although this has improved on it, it still has the \"wire melt\" back, which can be a fire hazard. The sides and top are \"cool touch\", but the back is still a single sheet of tin that this is a fire hazard for wires or power cables touching it.All the Design errors: 1) The crumb tray is miss-sized. It bangs up against the door when closed. To mitigate this you have to bend the lip on the the tray to be flat. It still hits the door, but less so. 2) The interior light still stays on only briefly which is annoying. 3) The touchscreen buttons are not lit, which makes them impossible to see in a dimly lit kitchen - this is the most brutal design error I've seen so far. The LCD screen lights up, but the touchscreen buttons remain in the dark. You have to memorize their locations to know what your pressing. 4) The lettering on the knobs is hard to read, and the paint was haphazardly applied.Build/Design error: This has been mentioned in other reviews, but the top left corner the of the case is miss-sized and is bent up from the frame it surrounds. This is not damage, this is a design and build error. The left wall is too high for the frame so it bends up on the top left corner. This resulted me in spending a day mulling over whether to return it.I'll update this review after more time with it. But the design flaws are obvious, and they should of known better.",
