                "reviewText": "I started searching for a new toaster oven to replace my older unit. I was looking for something that did more than just toast bread. I did a lot of research on a lot of different brands before hitting on this one. What really got my attention was it had 5 different modes for use. Not only would it toast but it also had an air fryer which I like. (I had a large bulky air fryer before and did not like it). If a buyer wants to purchase meals that go with this oven, can. They can set up an account with Tovala and have meals delivered to their home. I received a four - meal packet when I made the initial purchase. The meals were very good and preparation was simple. The oven has a scanner on the front which scans a bar code on the meal and cooks it accordingly. I chose not to subscribe to the meal service simply because I like preparing my own food. Also, it seems a bit pricey for me as well. That being said, the service might be just the right thing for a really busy or older person who my have trouble preparing their own meals. There are some store-bought brands that the scanner will recognize. A list of the companies is shown in the instructions.One thing I really like about this is I can place a piece of bread in for toasting, press the \"toast\" mode, choose \"1\" for time, (4.35 minutes), and when it shuts off, the bread is perfectly toasted. No under or over cook. No burnt bread.Using the air fryer takes some time to get to know the settings. I've found if the instructions on the product itself is followed, the results are pretty good. I've had to modify the time on some things, such as frozen potato wedges, but after using it for a few times I know how much time is required. Using the basket makes for easy cooking and cleanup as well.Oh, did I mention, you can control it with your smart phone as well?I conclusion, I would highly recommend this oven to someone looking to replace an older unit. It does so much more and does it well.",

My Dyson read our air quality as \u201cvery unhealthy \u201c while baking certain foods.The air fry rack is chrome, which it turned rusty and black after trying to wash it with water and soap. Not food safe, I had to use parchment paper or foil to prevent contamination to my foods (see my pictures).The worst part is their customer service, Tovala won\u2019t take responsibility for troubleshooting their ovens or accepting returns. Thanks goodness I bought it through Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "After using this a few months, I adore this oven. It's very well made, heats evenly, and the smart features are brilliant. My wife is not good at cooking, and having the bar code scanner work with some of the groceries that she eats (I wish it were programmable to add more) has been a godsend.The pre-programmed complex cook cycles are extremely well thought out. I've never been able to cook chicken as good as I did before I got this, and I've started making homemade pizzas in it instead of ordering out because it cooks them so well. I've also added my own programs for things I make regularly that aren't in the database which was very easy. I don't even use my full sized oven anymore.The Tovala meal service has pretty good (not great) food, but it is very overpriced so I cancelled it. The app and meal ordering process are very well done, though.The color, unfortunately, just doesn't match any other appliance ever made and looks very out of place in the kitchen. Also because it's light there are yellow stains from where the smoke escapes around the door that are literally impossible to clean. I would have ordered the black one except I didn't care for the steam aspect of it (it will constantly tell you to refill the water), and I wanted the two-speed air fryer to make things crispier.I might find a way to paint it black, honestly, and it would be perfect. If it ever stops working I'd order another one without hesitation.",

                "reviewText": "If you don't plan on using this oven for the Tovala meals, probably look for something else. The steam function is nice, but I could live without it. Preheating takes as long as a traditional oven. The fan isn't as strong as a regular air fryer, so it takes longer to cook, even at a higher temp, than an air fryer.The scan function for other foods is a good idea, but of the items that have actually scanned, a couple had wildly incorrect heating programs.I really don't like that if the timer ends you have to turn off the oven and completely reset the function and temp.Overall, if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't buy this. I would go straight air fryer or save my pennies for another 2 months and bought a different brand.",
