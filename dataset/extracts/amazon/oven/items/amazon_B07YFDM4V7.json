It's not big.. so no pizza's unless you cut before cooking. The lid tray at the bottom is your catch tray.. so remember to wash after each cook. Haven't tried the griddle.. had to swap my lid top Handel, this ones was missing.. luckily I had one.. so heads up.. other than that ... I've made square pizza \ud83c\udf55 \ud83d\ude0b burritos and biscuits. Nachos tomorrow Yaya!! No drips or leaks from the coffee pot. Came very well packaged box in a box with Styrofoam sides. I think with aluminum foil I could cook steak and chicken.. ohhhh ideas \ud83d\udca1 lol ohhhh red vinaigrette on raw flesh with onions peppers and season's wrapped, with cressed sides folded and broiled for 1 hour.. making you hungry hungry? \ud83d\ude0b wish u had one now doesn't it lol..update 01/19/2024 I've noticed that the heating element reduces in temperature as the timer clicks to zero.. so if your cooking bacon you might need to just keep turning the timer to max to keep it at a constant heat.. other than that.. its big enough to cook 4 ego waffle st one time.. the coffee maker is wonderful.. ohh one issue is the rack is not as big as the toaster racks.. it fits and works if you don't overload it with weight.. overall it's a good purchase and money well spent..",

It's a little larger than I anticipated it to be, but fits right on my RV kitchen counter. I wanted this because I've been using my single serve Kuerig with regular coffee, not kcups, and it was becoming a hassle to make the send cup of coffee. I also love bagels, eggs and bacon for breakfast. This was so easy to use. Living in an RV, you have so much space to use, so if I wanted to cook breakfast, I have to move things around to get to my stove. The clean up on this things was so easy. I have only two complaints at this time: 1. I added 2.5 cups of water to coffee make but it only made 2 cups. 2. The griddle cover should be bigger, as when cooking bacon, some of the bacon grease that filled around the edges spit out even with griddle covered.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for an Oven + Cooking station to carry in my car trunk when I go camping and sleep in the car.I was hesitating between the Teal Elite Gourmet Americana 2-Slice and the Red Nostalgia BST3RR. Both are small 3-in-1.I've bought both to compare them as I felt that there was not enough information on the product pages.First impressions:The Teal Americana is smaller and the coffee maker feels low-end plasticky.The Teal Americana has only one burner top and one bottom, where the Red Americana has two heating elements in the same positions.At first glance, I really liked that the Red Americana's griddle is the entire size of the oven: any bacon grease splatter will stay on the griddle, while it will land on the teal body on the other one. After using the Teal Americana during a trip, there is no bacon grease spatter due to the glass cover.Both are cute and playful. You want to make something to play with it... very fun toys.The buttons of the Red Nostalgia have a flat portion: one knows where they point to. The Teal Americana has round buttons with a minuscule indentation. I had to paint a white line on them to be able to see where they point.The coffee pot of the Teal Americana looked more secure in a moving car due to its 3 walls, but in the end, it's the Red Nostalagia carafe which is held stronger by the pressure of the no-drip ball.The oven rack of the Teal Americana is tied to the door and moves slightly with the door is opened. The Red Americana is independent of the door and has two positions (one for Teal Americana).Dimensions / Measurements: Length (similar): 19\" for the Red Nostalgia vs 18.5\" for the Teal Americana.Body depth (Teal Americana is way smaller): 7.3\" for Teal AmericanaBackspace needed (when water tank open): similarHeight: similar.Griddle Volume: Big surprising difference: the big Red Nostalgia's griddle is very flat and shallow. I was only able to pour 200 milliliter of water before it reached the cover. The cover also did feel very secure to me, feeling very twisted (see picture). The Teal Americana is much smaller in surface, but has a much bigger depth. I was able to pour 550 milliliter before reaching the cover mark. The Teal contains almost 3X more liquid than the Red.Coffee Pot: Similar: the Red Nostalgia is graduated for 3 cups and contains 522ml, while the Teal Americana is graduated for 4 cups and contains 515ml.Power: I plan to use one for Car Camping powered by the inverter from a Portable Power Station like a MaxOak BlueTTi, so I was especially interested in the Watts in operation. I used a Welltop Plug-in Socket Power Meter, Voltage Watt Energy Meter which gives instant+min+max watts used to measure. All numbers rounded to the nearest 5.Coffee Maker Only: Teal Americana: 605W vs Red Nostalgia: 570W = 6% difference = similar.Top Griddle Only: Teal Americana: 490W vs Red Nostalgia: 850W = 75% difference. No surprise here as I expected the two heating elements to burn 2X the power.Bottom Oven + Top Griddle together (no Coffee Maker): Teal Americana: 760W vs Red Nostalgia: 740W = suprisingly similar. Big surprise here. I reran the test multiple times, and indeed, when the four heating elements of the Red Nostalgia are on, I was seeing less power - 740W - than when only the top two were on - 850W -.Bottom Oven Only: Teal Americana: 290W vs Red Nostalgia: 340W = 17% difference.All on: Coffee Maker + Bottom Oven + Top Griddle: Teal Americana: 1300W vs Red Nostalgia: 1250W. Keeping the surprise, the Red Nostalgia uses less power when everything is turned on.The Red Nostalgia reaches its maximum power of 1350W when the bottom oven is off, and the Coffee Maker and the Top Griddle are both on.As I am very limited by my current inverter (600W) and its batteries, I went with the Teal Americana.My Teal Americana fits in the 40 Liter, 22 Inch Duffle Bags for Women, Men, Travel Heavy Duty (Black) from Trail Maker also bought on Amazon.Already used it on a few day trip where we were staying in hotel (no power limitations there) with fridge and no kitchen. It was used everyday and it was so nice to have breakfast in the room (in bed?) and be able to cook / reheat takeout. I recommend hat you get one of those 3-in-1 if you travel by car and camp or hotel.",

The griddle works great but requires time in-between batches of pancakes or eggs to reheat the griddle. The coffee maker works flawlessly but should allow the coffee to sit about 10 minutes to bring it at peak temperature. Overall, this works a advertised and would recommend this to anyone.",
