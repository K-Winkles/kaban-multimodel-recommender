                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Once again, we had an older product from 20 years ago that was way better than this one and cost less with a push start button.We needed this one for the size to fit in a shelving unit. It\u2019s good looking and has some good materials. The heat settings are indiscriminate. The lower levels dont seem to be accurate as we always end up turning it up very high.A few of the biggest drawbacks are:The turn knob will get overused. You have to dial past 20 and dial it back if you want it to ring when it\u2019s done. All this twisting will weaken it. Also, there\u2019s no heat protection from the top of the hot door when you go to grab the handle. It seems plenty of other models have protective strip there so as not to burn your fingers. That is probably the worst feature. The crumb pad isn\u2019t as good as our previous model as it sits in the inside, is quite thin AND does not catch all the crumbs.Seems to me that lots of features are wrung out and pared down for cost and we never see that as a savings to the consumer. We just see it as a profit to the corporation and quite honestly a product that more than likely will not last as long despite twice the cost of the older model. It\u2019s very disappointing. And honestly I\u2019m tiring of seeing these games be played with products across the board.Also, the aluminum pan got rusty pin marks, and scratches the first time it went through the top rack of the dishwasher. Now, regardless of whether it should go in there or not, I would expect that I can. No one is realistically washing that pan by hand.And one last item, the door flings down beyond level with the machine (past 180\u00b0\u2019s), so good luck, not burning yourself. )In summary: best qualities: look and size and under $100,worst: poorly thought design for the consumer and cheapness despite the cost, mesh tray is flimsy and could use a second tray to stack.We use this in lieu of a microwave.",

                "reviewText": "This item looked good in the pictures and had a brand name known to me for better quality. The price point was also reasonable. Sad to say, I was disappointed with my first use. I should have checked for a light inside as being listed in the description. There is none and that makes it hard to see the progress of the cooking. The fact that it is necessary to turn the timing knob to 20 first and then scaling back for shorter time is inconvenient and difficult because the knobs do not turn easily. The oven also gets very hot outside while using and I know this is not necessary because I have another one that does not do this. Finally, the casserole I tried to bake took extra, extra time to bake and did not brown well. So, determine how you want to use this item before ordering as it does not work easliy for all applications.",

The timer is a little strang as you have to turn the timer knob pass twenty and then back to cook time of less than twenty I was told that would damage the timer but I read the instructions twice and that\u2019s what it said",

                "reviewText": "This item has a nice clean look and fits perfectly in the space I have for it. And when in Turbo or Air Fry mode it\u2019s dead silent - you have to put your ear next to it to determine that the fan is on. That\u2019s the good news. At least I guess that\u2019s good news, but I wonder how much air is actually being moved inside it.The bad news: it\u2019s seriously underpowered. I wondered why competing models boasted of their wattage while this Oster omitted any mention. The Turbo/Air Fryer fan (same speed in either mode, near as I can tell) is so wimpy that it can\u2019t compensate for long preheat and cooking times. Expect the oven to take longer than you\u2019d expect for pretty much any task.An air fryer replacement? Forget it. The adjustable shelf doubles as the air fryer surface which means any food drippings land directly on the lower heating elements and burn onto them. I did remove the crumb tray (beneath the lower elements) to wrap it in foil, but in removing it I touched an adjacent trim piece that was so sharp that it slit my finger open. And forgetting the designed-in splatter, the air fryer feature seems to consist of inadequate broiler elements supplemented by an inadequate fan. If you\u2019re looking for air fryer functionality, look elsewhere.Finally, the included cooking tray is comically tiny - much smaller than the already small space available within the oven. So I bought a bigger tray + crisper basket combo to replace it and wring out a little extra performance. It didn't help. Good money after bad.This is one of those instances where you get what you pay for. I\u2019d suggest you consider paying a little more, especially if you use your toaster oven often.UPDATE 10/20/22 - I gave it away. I replaced it with a Hamilton Beach (ASIN B08C8H1PN2) with about the same compact footprint but with much more interior space, better racks and pans, more features and a lot more cooking power. It costs more than this Oster but is well worth considering if you use your countertop oven almost daily as I do, or if you want to be able to actually benefit from the air fryer capability.UPDATE 11/11/22 - Revised from 2 stars to 1 star and made minor edits above. The person I gave the Oster to gave it away to someone else and is shopping for another one. He appreciated the gift even knowing I didn't like it but from his perspective, it wasn't worth keeping at a price of zero. If you look at my reviews I almost never give 1 star. I realize that many others are happy with it so your mileage may vary.",
