                "reviewText": "It is nice mid-size toaster oven/air fryer built for a typical family of 3-4 people. It has Air Fry/ Air Broil/ Air Roast/ Rotisserie and Bake functions in addition to keep warm and several other pre-set functions. There are quite lot of features and functions available, and you won't miss any function.We have been using a Farberware AirFyer/ Toaster oven that started tripping circuit after 3 to 4 years of daily use. So Comfee replaced that. So, it was easy to use functions without referring to its manual. Here are key points:+ Comfee has many functions and it has every feature that you can imagine and will need. So good at that way. Presets makes it quite easy for lay users to set and cook.+ It distributes temperature quite well, and cooking has been consistently good. Electronic Cooling fan automatically comes and stops when needed. It is clearly noticeable when running, but is not loud as to bother you.+ Has a pre-heat function that runs before the actual cooking program begins. That is nice but you need to keep an eye as there is no warning or pre-signal when preheating is about to end so that you can put the actual food tray in.+ Has a squarish tray with 11.5\" X 10.75\"\" surface area (actual size with edges more like 12.5\"X11.5\"). This takes 11\" casserole dish. That works great for us. Unlike some bigger units (30+ liter volume), it will not fit larger 13 inch casserole dish if you have a larger family to feed/cook on daily basis. Bigger Farberware oven, it replaced had almost like 14.5 inch long tray, but took more counter space too. Make your choice!+ You can cook at two levels simultaneously (like a tray + wire mess by separating two different items) at two different levels which we couldn't do in Farberware. This feature can be quite useful at times as you can separate items and cook.+ This is a counter top oven and you can cook a small chicken or chicken piece (less than 4lb) in rotissiery. We haven't tried yet but have no reason to believe it won't do a good job.+ Build quality of unit is good; tray and other accessories look good and well made. The Unit looks good and will fit decor of most kitchens.In short, a good value for a well made unit, with lots of features. Recommended !!",

                "reviewText": "Older counter oven broke so boyfriend invested in this as a gift for me. Works great since I rarely cook up stuff large enough to use my huge oven and my huge oven is way older. Dont think its temp is as accurate as it use to be. Its cheaper to buy one of these compared to a huge oven especially when im not making huge amounts of food. I also dont cook enough for left overs, its usually the amount we need that night and this oven has enough space for that for us.I havent used it to the full extent just yet. I did make my two kids pizza rolls and bagel bites with the air fryer a couple of times to test it out. Its decent. Though feel all the rage of air frying is blown up way more than it is. Or maybe im just the rare odd one. I feel baking them still tasted near the same or better than the air fry. But hoping to do more experimenting. Cooked bacon in it, toasted bread. Love heating up store bought bread rolls in this thing. Set it to 290 for like 5-8 minutes depending on how crispy you want it. I like it lightly crispy but warm like it came fresh out the oven and this does the job.I was worried over how the settings would be with it being digital, but this set up is easy to work with and only took me a second to learn it. Its very versatile and easy. Only thing that bothers me is when air frying, even after it has stopped and you turn it off completely by hitting the cancel button, it still sounds like it is going on the inside. Like fans are still running. They instantly run when you set it to start but they dont seem to instantly stop when you hit the cancel button. it eventually turns off but causes a bit of worry in the back of my mind. So far it hasnt caused an issue since my work area isnt far from the kitchen. The sound is noticeable, but that doesnt personally bother me, its just I just worry safety wise if heat is still going even though screen is completely turned off as in the device should no longer be active or making noise like it is.",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoy this oven. Air frying is definitely worth the hype. I wasn\u2019t sure before getting this but my goodness. It almost makes a frozen pizza taste fresh! And as an Italian from Philly, I take my pizzas seriously and do not say that lightly! Haha\u2026There is a slight issue for me with setting the timer. I just think because it\u2019s a knob that you turn, it\u2019s not always easy to set the exact time you want. But this is not make or break for me. The fact that I can roast, rotisserie, air fry, make delicious pizzas, etc definitely makes up for this small issue.It was just a bit of a learning curve in understanding how this oven works. Still to this day, I overcook things! But this is not the oven\u2019s fault, imho. It\u2019s so powerful and works so well, there\u2019s often discrepancies in time & this oven is done cooking much faster than you realize. (It may also be because I often choose to simply air fry over traditional bake, which is obviously MY error).But once you hit the sweet spot, the food cooked in this thing is delicious. I think it\u2019s well worth the cost and the learning curve. There are also some good YouTube videos on it to understand it more. Overall, I do really enjoy it and I do recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I've had 2 AIRFRYERS now---this one is outstanding!! Easy to use, easy to clean (has a removable try in the bottom) it's large enough to broil a chicken if I wanted to but small enough to keep up on my kitchen counter all the time. I am very happy with the cooking/frying/baking options I've used so far, there are several options including roasting, broiling, toasting, etc!! I use this for two of us almost daily instead of our gas oven--I got this at a great price as well, I'm a happy camper! I have no problem recommending this brand of Air Fryer.",
