Long story short, they sent me the next model up. My new oven also grills. If you want your food fast and save the power needed to preheat your oven, this is for you. It would have been all I needed in college. It can bake a cake, cook a pizza, air fry 30 wings, reheat leftovers. Hate soggy microwave pizza, this is your answer. Just can't say enough.

                "reviewText": "My wife wanted one these for years. I resisted, saying we already had a stove, why do we need another little stove?Dear reader, I was wrong. Turns out this is one of the most useful kitchen appliances I\u2019ve ever bought. Here\u2019s what I like:- Cook times are incredibly short. This thing heats up quick and cooks fast. A 2 lbs bag of cauliflower florets is done in 25 minutes. A frozen pizza that would take 25-28 minutes in the big oven is done in 10-12 minutes.- It\u2019s incredibly helpful to have a second stove when cooking for a crowd.-It\u2019s the summer kitchen I\u2019ve always wanted. It doesn\u2019t heat the house up like the big stove, and if necessary I can plug it in outside so the kitchen is not heated at all.What I don\u2019t like:- Questionable durability. My first one broke in less than a year. The broiler functions stopped working and I was able to return it. I tried a cheaper replacement but it was terrible - slow, uneven cooking. So I got another one of these.This is very basic technology, and if they built it to last I\u2019d have no complaints. Plus, it\u2019d be better for the environment.Overall, though, it\u2019s great. I use it at least four nights a week. If you\u2019re on the fence go ahead and buy it. You won\u2019t regret it.Update April 2021: Bought a replacement on Amazon in July 2020. By April 2021 the function knob failed on the new unit. Waiting to hear back from Cuisinart on a possible replacement, but these are clearly not designed for use in a busy family. They are too expensive to have to replace every 9 to 12 months, and the cost difference between a a cheap selector knob and a quality selector knob can't be more than a few dollars for the volume a large company like Cuisinart is buying. Is doubly disappointing as we typically just leave it on the convect bake feature - the function knob doesn't even see much use.",

I love everything it can do and the size is perfect. The first one died after 5 years of daily use for everything from toast to air frying. A++ to Cuisinart for a great product. Hope this is still being made if I ever need another because I would buy it again. .",

                "reviewText": "Cuisinart TOA-70W AirFryer Oven with Grill in White - Looks nice in white. Tired of stainless bc it\u2019s not truly stainless. Finger prints, oil and smudges become difficult to clean off of a stainless surface so i opted for white and it looks great on the counter. Con - the rack tips and slides out so easily that whatever is resting on it can fall right out. Best to use with silicone hot pan holders so you control the rate of slide w/o burning fingers. I did buy an additional easy clean pan that fits the rack for air frying, baking and broiling and it\u2019s heavy so that\u2019s what slides out easily. Pro - air fry\u2019s like a dream in a few short minutes and reheats prepared food like a charm retaining moisture and flavor. Saves energy bc you\u2019re not lighting up the whole oven or microwaving which is not cool. The included cookbook is useful. I would imagine it can be hard to clean the glass over time so regular cleaning would be better than waiting until it gets real dirty.\u2026..its been a few weeks of use and the oven doesn\u2019t heat evenly. The temp is off. Interior Design is not well done and the heating elements doe not distribute heat evenly throughout the oven so burning and under-cooking happens easily. Too bad.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this Cuisinart TOA-60 for about several weeks now. My comment is for someone who can not decide whether to buy or not. The following two reasons were why I waited for so long.1. Does the machine gets HOT? This was my big concern. Well, it does get hot, but, nothing dangerously. The best place is where it sits back in the corner of your counter/cupboard.2. Does it make toast? Yes! I replaced my Cuisinart Toaster for this. I bake my own bread and it never tasted this GOOD. The reason for this is; it does not dry out. I start with a slice of frozen bread. Just before it gets golden color, I turn it off, butter it, place it on the plate to keep it warm until the rest of the breakfast is ready. My toast is crispy outside and still moist inside, and I can really taste my homemade bread that I could not taste before using a toaster.For dinner, I used Air Fryer to cook; chicken, pork chop, steak, burger, brats. They all came out great, and FAST. Well, you get the hang of it, you prepare your Air Fryer first whatever you are cooking, (watch youtube ) set the time, while you are getting ready for other things such as setting the table, making salad etc., your Air Fryer is working. When the bell rings your entire dinner is done and serve!I have a tip for cleaning up. For Air Fry, ALWAYS line the pan with aluminum foil to catch the dripping. And, right after cooking, soak the rack in the soapy warm water. By the time you finish your dinner, the rack is cleaned in the soapy water. Also, clean the inside of the machine with soapy wet paper towel each after use. Mine still looking like a brand new. Also, if you are not using the machine for cooking, I use it for warming the plates/rolls. For homemade cookies? just place them for \"warm\" for 5 min and you get the flaky, just came out of the oven \"cookies\" every time.I just can not say enough about this Cuisinart TOA-60 that changed my life.I am still learning everyday. I am in my 70's and never thought that my way of cooking was going to change in this way.....",

Like the reviews online dont turn the timer dials back by hand because you could snap the dial off. That is a small price to pay for such a great appliance.
