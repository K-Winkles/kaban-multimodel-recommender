I would like to point out, this oven is COMPLETELY quiet, you wouldn't even know it was on unless you touch it to check for heat. I have never seen an over that did not make any noise. You know it's finished because the buzzer goes off. I'm tempted to sell my oven and get one of these, the heating seems perfect too. Just had to write a review, I'm so impressed.",

It\u2019s controls mimic the digital display and three selection-dial layout of the popular, expensive toaster ovens.The three selection dials\u2014function, temperature and time\u2014make it extremely easy to setup the oven. The oven preheats fairly quickly and can cook almost anything that you could cook in a larger oven unless it is just too big.The oven has a convection feature that helps distribute the heat for even cooking. It performed very well in cooking pizzas, chicken breasts, fish fillets, cookies, etc. It comes with racks, trays and even a rotisserie device.It is a great appliance addition for cooking smaller portion items or additional entrees or side dishes if you have a larger family or company the demands more than a single oven.Why is is less expensive than some of your high-end toaster ovens? It uses traditional tube heating elements as opposed to quartz heating elements. This makes preheating slightly longer and the wattage is slightly lower\u20141,500 vs. 1,800. It also is not as well insulated as some toaster ovens which means the exterior surfaces may become a little hotter. That said, you normally do not want to touch the top, sides or back of any toaster oven when it is cooking at higher temperatures.For the price, this oven is a great value and performs extremely well. Unless you are set on owning a high-end toaster oven (Breville, Cuisinart, Calphalon, etc.), this oven will serve you well.",

                "reviewText": "Toaster ovens all do about the same thing and come down to size, controls, and to a lesser degree features. This oven looks good, it heats quickly and seems to cook evenly so it does the job. But there are 2 issues I have with it to consider when comparing with others.1-Controls. They work, are simple to understand and do the job. But after 30 years of taster ovens with 3 simple knob controls, I have to say that using 3 knobs to then set values that are then shown on a screen doesn't make a lot of sense. For sure if used daily and often as I do, 3 simple knobs with feature, temp, and time are quicker and more convenient. With no screen and just knobs you get used to the positions of the knobs and set the oven without even thinking about it.With an LCD screen, you have to pay attention to each setting on the screen, scroll through choices, sometimes going around the whole range for the setting to start from the beginning etc. And do this for all 3 settings 3 plain knobs and no screen are much quicker I'm afraid and although LCD digital displays are all the rage, they do nothing to add function or save time.2-Preheat. There is no real preheat function on this oven. I'm not sure why a preheat function isn't included on every oven no matter the size. EVERY cooking instruction starts with 'preheat oven to xxx degrees'. Yet, no preheat function. So, you either have to put your food into a room temp oven and set the time and temp to include preheat time... which means the first 3-4 minutes of your cooking time is really preheat time where the burners are at max which can't be good for the food, , or you have to turn on the oven, set the temp desired, set the timer to around 4 minutes and come back when preheated and then put the food in and start over with all the settings fort he cooking phase. Makes no sense.The oven, all ovens should have a preheat feature where you set a temp and hit 'preheat'. Then when the oven reaches the temp a preheat bell goes off and you are ready to cook. For me this is a pretty significant issue because as I said, I end up putting everything in at room temp and then exposing my food to the preheat cycle and have to set all settings, time, temp, feature twice. Not a show stopper but something to consider.Still a good oven.",

                "reviewText": "I love my new Countertop Oven. It heats up really quickly, and cooks very well!!!I cannot promise that the temperature is accurate, because I haven't checked it out. Because it's small, it heats up so much faster than a full sized oven!!! It is very easy to set everything and will cook for a max time of 2 hours. Beware that 2 hours in a small oven can burn your food, if the temperature is set too high!!! This oven gets plenty hot, and it doesn't heat up the house!!! It is wonderful!!! I am thrilled that I bought this oven!!!The ONLY issue or problem that I can see is that it is too small for a regular cake pan - a 9\" x 13\". I like to cook my casseroles in a large cake pan, and that size will NOT fit in this countertop oven, but I knew that this would probably be an issue. I am still tickled to have this over!!!If you folks ever decide to make a larger oven or at least a longer one, let me know!!! I would definitely be interested!!!",
