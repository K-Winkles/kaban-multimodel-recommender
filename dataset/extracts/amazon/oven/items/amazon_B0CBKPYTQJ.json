                "reviewText": "We got this to use as an oven pan rack because the old rack has worn out. While the size doesn't fit perfectly, it works well (although with a slight tilt). Our oven is also deep enough for this rack to sit on top of the oven rack, which is perfect for items like a frozen pizza with instructions to heat directly on an oven rack (without actually using the hard to wash oven rack).It also works on a cookie sheet to raise things off the bottom while in the oven -- another big win! And of course, it can also be a cooling rack outside the oven.We popped it in the dishwasher after it arrived and it looks great afterward -- sturdy and strong enough for most food items up to steaks and chicken leg quarters. A full size roast or whole chicken might be a bit much, but we have a different roasting pan and rack for that.",

The baking paper sheets that come with is awesome and makes clean up so easy. It is not much different than the basket that came with my air fryer, it cleans up easily.

It is sturdy, shiny, and glides perfectly in each rack position in my oven. The parchment sheets are a nice bonus!",

We used it in our oven with the convection setting. Which isn't exactly the same as air fryer but met our needs. The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because I don't know what materials are in the basket coating.",
