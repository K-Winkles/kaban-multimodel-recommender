It offers a variety of functions, including baking, toasting, warming, pizza, broil and much more, all of which work like a charm. The timer is a convenient feature that adds to its functionality.However, it's worth noting that this toaster oven is on the larger side, so be prepared to allocate some extra counter space. On the plus side, it comes with an array of trays that are quite handy for various cooking needs. Additionally, the French doors not only add a touch of elegance but also make accessing your food a breeze.In summary, if you have the counter space to spare, this toaster oven is a fantastic addition to your kitchen. Its impressive performance and versatile trays, coupled with the stylish French doors, make it a worthwhile investment.",

It takes many attempts to change temperature while baking something. That is my only complaint. Oven is large (same size as my previous one), but not very heavy. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with it.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Best Counter Oven On The Market - One Downside",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have been searching and researching for a while to find the best counter top oven to replace my RV oven (that barely holds a loaf pan) to be able to cook in. This one takes the cake! No, literally!ACTUAL BAKING AREA:15.25in W x 6.5in H (depth is rounded at the back)This takes into account the heating elements at the top and the bump ins on the sides for the racks.Pros:SIZE!!! The size of this thing can\u2019t be beat! I fit my glass 9x13 glass pan in with a hair to spare (will not fit the glass pan with the very wide rounded handles). The height inside beautifully gives space for my breads to rise and I could even fit my 5.5qt lodge Dutch oven (I just inverted the knob handle to the inside - would have fit if the heating elements weren\u2019t lower than the opening).I can fit my cookie sheet (note this is the middle size Walmart cookie sheet, not your standard 1/2 sheet (16in wide), this is slightly smaller but bigger than a 1/4 sheet.BAKING OPTIONS: there are so many options to cook in this thing, I use the dehydrate as my proofing for bread as keep warm is just a hair too hot. The air fryer works beautifully allowing the air to get all around. The temperature is pretty spot on, if you use convection, maybe drop the temp a bit when cooking to compensate.FRENCH DOORS: having a small space to work with, I truly appreciate the French doors vs a drop down door.STRENGTH OF RACK: this sucker is STURDY! It easily holds the giant lodge Dutch oven. Not a sway, bend or bounce.Did I mention the size!!?? (That\u2019s like at least worth 5 more pro check marks \u263a\ufe0f)Cons: there\u2019s gotta be something because nothing on the market is perfect.NO KEEP-ON OPTION: everything has to have a time and then it shuts off when the time is done. Our teeny cuisinart has a keep on feature, not sure why this one doesn\u2019t as it actually is more like an oven.TOP IS REALLY HOT: I use my silicone mat for the top of the oven to constantly remind myself it gets hotter than anything and to not place anything on top when it\u2019s on. The sides aren\u2019t too bad and grateful the area around the buttons stay cool too.BUTTONS DON\u2019T BEEP: ok, maybe this one is preference, but I find it odd tapping buttons that make zero sounds\u2026..? But maybe that\u2019s just me.WISH IT CAME WITH TWO RACKS: we have been using the air fryer rack as a second rack and it does the trick, but would prefer two racks to just come with it or have an option to buy after.REALLY SHORT CORD: like I mean REALLY short! I understand how power works and why the cord is short but dang, it\u2019s short! And using in an RV, really limited the spot to put it.EMITS A LOT OF HEAT: ok, not really a con, because it\u2019s an oven, they all emit heat from them. But just fair warning to any small space user, it will heat up your space.FINAL THOUGHTS: I\u2019ve made white bread loaves, sourdough, Dutch oven baked, cookies, casseroles, cinnamon rolls, Dutch baby\u2019s, more cookies, reheated meals, fried, proofed, and more in just the few short weeks we\u2019ve had this and I can\u2019t imagine going on without it.As a Full Time RV\u2019er, I wanted to have the ability to cook and bake like I did in our sticks & bricks, and this gave me that option.So happy with this product!",

                "reviewText": "These ovens are awesome! This replaces an older one that we now use in our RV. It will blow your mind how well this works! I use the convection a lot & this cooks so fast you'll probably over cook some things at first, lol! This has 3 rack slots, old 1 had 2. The new top slot allows you to broil & brown! In the ones with 2 shelf slots you have to put something under your pan to lift the food close enough to the element. I highly recommend Oster, from long time experience. The complaints about the door...Just be careful to open fully! And you should be using oven mitts anyway! Someone said the racks won't stay. I experienced this 1x. I used a pan a smidge wider than the oven. Guess what...it pushed the walls out just enough. Standard 9\"x13\" pans fit but they can't have \"handles\" that round out on the ends. To measure for pans, use the pan that it comes with. Do not use the rack itself! Like most things-use a bit of gray matter aka your brain, lol, before you complain something is faulty! Thanks Oster!!",

                "reviewText": "Haven't used it too much yet but so far so good. This model has improved features over our last Oster we had although we really liked it and it lasted 5 years. This newer model can air fry and what I really like is you set the temperature and when it reaches it the inside light comes on and it beeps. The older model did not do this had to use an oven thermometer. The only thing I haven't' figured out how to bypass the timer - when it's on bake or convections I'd rather just watch the time myself. Size it great - we can put in a roast pan or 9x13 tray - love it. Fingers crossed lasts as long a the last one.",

                "reviewText": "Es el mejor horno que hemos tenido, despu\u00e9s de nuestro antiqu\u00edsimo y heredado de una t\u00eda de los EUA, y que fue utilizado desde 1960 aproximadamente, de nombre Roto- Broiler, nunca podr\u00e1n igualar es calidad de manufactura y con un enorme recetario, muy robusto y grande, nunca tronaba la l\u00e1mina cuando se calentaba.Acerca del Oster que adquirimos, esta muy bonito, bien dise\u00f1ado, y pr\u00e1ctico.Se puede limpiar bien, es r\u00e1pido como debe de ser, me gustar\u00eda que puedan vendernos una parrilla extra de freidora y otra de asar.Ya horneamos, pastel, cup cakes, pies, pizzas, todo casi bien, ya iremos calculando mejor algunos tiempos, ya que en donde vivimos, cerca de la CDMX estamos a 2,600 metros sobre el nivel del mar.Me gusta que el programa de cada operaci\u00f3n, ya sea asar, hornear, pizza, etc. ya viene con el tiempo y la temperatura programadas, y de ah\u00ed podemos subir o bajar seg\u00fan queramos, pero en general esos l\u00edmites est\u00e1n correctos y hay que seguirlos de primera vez y probar, tal vez por eso el manual no es muy expl\u00edcito y no trae recetario, aunque por ese precio bien pod\u00edan entregar uno, sobre todo si sabemos que Oster es una buena marca y es una divisi\u00f3n de Sunbeam.Yo tengo una freidora de 7 litros de GoWiseUSA y es bastante buena, este horno Oster que tambi\u00e9n es freidora, necesito probarlo, ase unas verduras con el modo freidora y se tostaron un poco las cebollas que estaban a la salida del aire, as\u00ed que recomiendo que pongan de ese lado calabazas o zanahorias, en este punto que quedo pensando si es mejor una freidora con el aire en la parte superior y cocine m\u00e1s parejo.Hay alguien que coment\u00f3 que los n\u00fameros del display est\u00e1n muy peque\u00f1os y tiene toda la raz\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s empujar los botones es algo duro, prefiero los botones botones, en este sistema de Oster llegas a fallar pensando que lo apretaste, pero no obedeci\u00f3.Despu\u00e9s de 1-2 horas de uso, los tronidos de la l\u00e1mina, se vuelven m\u00e1s frecuentes, tal vez el grosor de la l\u00e1mina es muy delgada o estructuralmente tiene algunas fallas.Pero en fin estamos entusiasmados y sabemos que no es un Roto-Broiler, no es tan robusto y pesado, pero seguiremos probando.Gracias\u2026",

I'd give it 5 stars, even though it's a bit noisy when it runs, and the timer isn't very loud when it alerts you, even though it seems to remind you in spurts until you turn it off.",
