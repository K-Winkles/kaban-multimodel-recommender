                "reviewText": "OVEN REVIEWI operate a small cottage bakery and needed an additional oven to expand my baking opportunities. Purchased end of September 2021 and has been in use since. So far, this oven has met all of my requirements. There will be a small learning curve, but that is to be expected with any new oven. Temperatures and timings will need to be reconsidered \u2013 keep notes!!!PROSThe oven heats up quickly, about the same as my 30 inch oven. It retains heat reasonably well \u2013 takes a short while to come back up to temperature after loading all three racks. You need to load quickly to not lose too much heat.Not as loud as other reviewers have stated. About the same as my Kenmore (cheap) dishwasher.Alarm beeps 15-16 times and then shuts off. Alarm is not extremely loud or annoying, but you know when it times off!Bakes evenly on all three levels/shelves. There appears to be a cooler spot on the left rear position. I rotate the pan(s) half way through baking to get even cooking/browning.Nice that it operates on standard household current. The cost to install another 240V line was a major deciding factor in my choosing this model.Footprint is not too large. Only takes up a 2 foot square area. Think large microwave.The outside of oven does get hot, but not too hot.Interior is easy to clean.BAKE TEST RESULTS.18 sourdough bagels (6 per sheet/5 ounce each) takes about 15-18 minutes at 425-450FSix 8 inch focaccias (2 pans per shelf) bake in 20-25 minutes at 425-450FBrioche loaves (two 5x10 inch pans) bake in 35 minutes at 300-325FEveryday sandwich loaves bake in 30-35 minutes at 325FCONSAfter 2 months of use \u2013 none so farNOTESBetter to use a nonstick silicone baking mat instead of parchment paper. The paper does get blown around by the fan.",

                "reviewText": "I've had a 1/4 size Cadco, which I bought used, in my kitchen for a few years now. Aside from the fan dying (easy to replace), it's been a great little oven. So, when it was time to get one for my bakery, I looked to Cadco again because I like that it was available in 120V and the price/performance has been solid. This newer, bigger oven is nice, but I'm not quite as crazy about it.Pros:* 120V, so you can use it in more places without wiring hassles* 3 racks with plenty of space for cookies or other flat items* Cooks evenly* The marks in the thermostat dial are too close together. I worry that I when I try for 300, I could be getting anything from 285-315.* The fan is very strong and very loud. I used this at home for awhile, and it was too loud for my home kitchen. In the commercial kitchen, it's no problem. It's much louder than my old 1/4-size oven, though not as loud as the ancient full-size ovens at the bakery where I used to work.* It beeps incessantly when the timer runs out. It's loud and screechy and goes on and on and on. The thing is, if you turn the timer dial the other direction, where it stays on until you turn it off, it also beeps and beeps and beeps when you turn it off. Totally unacceptable for home. To work around this, I set it to stay on and then hooked it up to a power strip with a switch on it and used the switch to turn it on and off.* The racks seem to wander. My counter is level, but one or two racks will gradually vibrate their way forward. They then touch the door and make a loud buzzing noise. All this movement and noise is driven by the vibration from the fan.Three of these four downsides are not a big deal in a commercial kitchen, but are kind of deal-breaker for home use. So far, the thermostat issue seems like it'll be ok for what I make, but I'd consider the digital model if I was buying again.",
