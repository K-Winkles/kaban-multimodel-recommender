                "reviewText": "When I retired last August, I bought a new oven with an air fryer function. This (Samsung) oven that I love so much did NOT come with an air fryer tray (why, Samsung???) so I had to order one. I found this one, and it's large enough to make a lot of food, and very easy to clean. It does indicate that it's dishwasher safe, but I always handwash it because it's so easy to clean. The basket is made of copper coated wire, and is a little flimsy. The tray is very sturdy, I wish that the tray was also. This gets used all the time to air fry foods that used to be cooked in oil, so we are saving calories and cooking oil.",

I do agree with other reviewer as the pan is a bit flimsy and warps at air fryer heat of 400 degrees. It would seem that the manufacturer would have seen this issue too. It should be able to withstand the heat as it is made for specifically for air frying. The pan does return to it's original shape once cool.",
