                "reviewText": "After having a bad experience with a Breville Convection Toaster Oven breaking down on me after a little over a month, I decided that I really didn\u2019t need a top of the line toaster...but I ended up buying one anyways. The Cuisinart Chef\u2019s Convection Toaster Oven is probably the priciest toaster oven I purchased, but dang, does it work well. This little beast pretty much replaced my standard oven when making oven baked items for my family. I\u2019ve made turkey legs, lamb roasts, oven fries, meatballs, cookies, and even reheated leftovers in this thing with great results. Also, this little oven makes for a great slice of toast - it seems to do it all. The oven heats up quickly, has a great convection setting that makes items like fries and chicken skin crisp, and is relatively intuitive to use.As per suggested by other reviewers, I did paint a few layers of clear nail polish over the buttons prior to use, and I haven\u2019t had any issues with the lettering on the buttons fading or chipping off. The outside of the oven does get a bit hot like most toaster ovens do, but the heat and temperature seems to stay within the oven as well - I didn\u2019t have any issues with heat leaking out the door or the door not completely shutting. This toaster oven comes with two wire racks, metal oven tray with metal rack on top, and a pizza stone. It has a light so you can see clearly into the oven - something I didn\u2019t even know I would need or end up loving - and the timer bell is loud enough to hear, but not so loud that I would wake up everyone in the other rooms when it goes off. The oven automatically shuts off once the timer sounds, so you don\u2019t need to worry about keeping track of the unit to make sure it\u2019s off.In terms of cleaning the unit, it\u2019s relatively easy to clean. I have been wiping down the inside and outside of the unit every few weeks, although it\u2019s recommended to wipe down after every use. My oven doesn\u2019t seem to be getting much build up despite almost daily use, although I would recommend wiping it down if you cook foods in it that have a tendency to splatter oil such as meat. I\u2019ve owned this unit for a little over half a year and find it to be one of the most useful kitchen appliances to have on hand - it definitely earned its spot on my kitchen counter. Overall, this is an attractive, well made, and very useful appliance to have in the kitchen - it\u2019s definitely worth every cent that I paid for it and I would buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "For more than a year I'd been eyeing this unit as a replacement for my old and beat-up Cuisinart toaster oven, which served us well for a decade or so but had seen better days. Air frying seemed interesting, but I had zero interest in a dedicated appliance, and thewirecutter.com claimed this model air-fried better than any dedicated air fryer. I finally pulled the trigger a few weeks ago, and while the unit has some minor quirks and is missing what I think is a key accessory, it's overall great. First, the quirks:1. The \"beep\" signal is barely audible and the volume and tone can't be changed. Thankfully we all have timers on our phones, in our smart devices, on other appliances, etc. If you are going to be away from the kitchen, you'll want to use one of those instead.2. The temperature can only be adjusted in 25-degree increments. This doesn't matter all that much; recipes that call for 360 degrees will be just fine at 350 (or lower, see #6 below).3. The light stays on for a strangely long time before auto-shutoff. I usually turn it off manually, for fear of hastening that far-off time when the bulb dies.4. For air frying, you absolutely must get a basket so that the air properly circulates around the food. I purchased the \"EaZy MealZ Round Crisper Basket\" which fits this model perfectly and is well worth the $17.5. After a few weeks I still find navigating the cooking options to be a bit awkward, just the first bit when you are selecting a main mode. Eh, not a big deal.6. There is a learning curve. Recipe instructions for regular ovens have to be adjusted, otherwise you will overcook your food. This is apparently true of many appliances of this kind. For most things I've tried so far (from baking banana bread to air-frying chicken wings) I've dropped the temp 50 degrees and/or reduced the cooking time.Speaking of chicken wings, STELLAR in this thing. Crispy as all get-out, and no oil needed. Here's my recipe, if you can call it that as it's so simple:1. Defrost wings sections if frozen, and pat them as dry as possible.2. Place them in the aforementioned basket (which can fit 12-15 pieces) and sprinkle generously with kosher salt.3. No need to preheat the oven; using the \"dual cook\" function, first \"speed conv\" at 350 for 24 minutes, then at 400 for 12 minutes. Carefully transfer to a bowl and toss with whatever sauce you prefer, if any.Air-frying on \"speed conv\" is also brilliant for reheating fast food fries (in the basket, hit them with an oil spray first, five minutes at 325, salt immediately when done cooking) and leftover pizza (either on a piece of foil or directly on the wire rack, 325 or so for several minutes). Haven't tried veggies yet, but I expect similarly great results. For pre-packaged foods, even if the instructions say to defrost first, \"speed conv\" and experience using this unit allows you to get right to cooking without the defrosting.The unit comes with a broiling pan -- pretty straightforward -- and a pizza stone, which works well but can be a pain to clean.All the general toaster oven stuff works great, no need to get into the details here. There's tons of cooking space for a device of this kind, and I find myself using it far more than I ever did our old unit. For small batches of things, it's now my go-to oven/frying device.In short: Expect to spend some time learning how best to use it for whatever it is you like to bake/fry. It won't take long, and once you do, you'll probably love this thing.",

Very easy to operate and food comes out perfect every time. The drip pan is so easy to clean, not like the cheaper models that you have to scrub. Cruisinart also thought to make it so you able to adjust the bell so you can hear it. The convection part is quiet but definitely running. I love the speed convection. I haven't found anything that I dislike about this so far. Well worth the money. I've had toaster ovens most of my life, even another Cuisinart. This one is the best!",

This oven has a 3 year warranty so I simply filled out the warranty for online. I received a reply stating Cuisinart would send me a new replacement and to simply cut the power cord on the old one and recycle it. Great service!",
