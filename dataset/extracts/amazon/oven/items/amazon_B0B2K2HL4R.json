                "reviewText": "The quality seems good. It is lightweight, average in toasting, bakes well for such a small oven. I like the size and the controls seem to be sturdy and not likely to break. The downside is that one time it started to burn things and run very hot I unplugged it and it seemed to reset, so far so good. The other detail that is bothersome is that the temperature control has very small printing and odd temperatures for people in the US. I can easily work around this because I'm an experienced cook but it might throw someone else off. Another thing is that it comes with no crumb tray. Luckily I had one from another toaster oven. It's a little too small but does the job. I would say it's a very good value for a countertop oven and it's a good size you could probably fit a small whole chicken in there. I can cook a variety of foods with one appliance and that is important to me because I'm in a very small studio apartment and I only have one portable induction burner. Safe to say this is a handy appliance for me. I use it nearly every day.",

                "reviewText": "I got the small (9L) toaster oven. The reasons I give it three stars instead of 1 or 2 are because it's the exact size I wanted for my available counter space (4 slices is a pathetic lie, yet almost par for the course), it has a nice looking all black finish, it provides simple control (less chance for breaking) yet it does all I require, and it looks like it may hold up indefinitely - for all that's bad, it appears sturdy. Although acceptable to me, what's wrong with it is legion: it's near impossible to get a center spot where cooking or toasting is even close to being even - but in looking at similar ovens with one heating bar above and one below, they must suffer near identical issues. So your food is going to be cooked or toasted irregularly, and sometimes really screwed up depending on multiple factors. Yet I'm mostly ok with it since I know what I'm getting.The timer cannot be stopped (don't try) as the knob will only turn one way (time can be extended though) so when you want to stop early, you have to turn the heat off and let the timer run out. The heat control has a big F for Fahrenheit which is kind of weird, and the icon for the timer is alien symbol to me. It's made in China and sold here as 1500 watt but the manual says rated power is 1000 watt. It deserves no stars for that alone.Maybe I'll come back and provide the correct dimensions which took quite an effort to locate before I bought it.The manual/pamphlet is worthless and they tossed in random electrical warning discussion about a 5 amp fuse when it has no fuse. There is no pretense of any kind of warranty. The knobs are weakly marked to indicate which end is the pointer. I added white paint dots.There is one thing that could be of value in achieving more even cooking (although I haven't tried yet because I use it infrequently): preheat for a least a few minutes. I put an oven thermometer in it once and much more than half the time was spent warming up to the target temp.It does look good and it's easy to clean despite not having a crumb tray.",

Does the job and is capable of 500Deg F per an independent temp gauge used to verify.Arrived in mostly good shape except the top of the outer metal cover had a 2\u201d diameter dent.
