                "reviewText": "I've had this for a year now, still like it as much as the 1st day I unboxed it. Easy to use, easy to clean and cooks like it should. I have not measured the temps so I don't know how accurate it is, but I bake bread in it all the time, it works beautifully. Large enough to fit 2 racks of food (this will slow down cooking time) for a full meal. It's become slightly discolored from cleaning, but that's not a bad thing. I clean it every time I use it. It's BIG, almost any pot or pan will fit.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this first as a gift for family; then after seeing it in action, I decided to try it myself.This really is a do-it-all device that makes cooking so much easier on days when you don't feel like making a huge mess on the stove or using the oven. One thing to note, you need to experiment a bit with cook times to get a feel for how it cooks. When first trying to cook an item in this fryer, I recommend pausing and using a temperature probe to test the temp. That way you can develop the ideal cook times for different types of food.Pros:- Easy to clean and tray slides right out of the bottom to dump out crumbs- Well built, but not excessively heavy- Lots of different functions to choose from, and control interface is simple and intuitive- Available app to control it- Nice recipe book included with the manualCons:- A bit noisy when the fan is on- This oven has a pre-heat setting where you have to wait to put the food in, something some competing products don't require- Toast function could toast a bit more evenly. Only the two outside heating elements on the top of the oven get fully heated while the middle two get slightly less hot, which makes the toast color a bit uneven.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this as a gift to myself and am so glad I did. It's the perfect to fit my counter without taking up too much space. The perfect size to cook for 2-4 people, everything comes out fantastic. Crispy fries, fish, pizza, baked goods, etc. I am sorry I didn't buy one of these years ago. So much better for you than deep frying and half the mess. It's so easy to clean, and the crumb tray takes only a second to empty and wipe off. It's taken me a few days to learn how to use it completely but I was shocked at it's easy of operation after only the first use. It's well worth the price and I can highly recommend to anyone, even those who think air frying isn't going to be cooked like you are used to.",

                "reviewText": "We've been using this air fryer/toaster oven for about three weeks now. It is easy to clean. It looks very nice. Sturdy and no operational issues. One thing to note - if you want to turn off the display lights, you hold down the time/shade button for three seconds. There is an error in the instruction booklet about this and I had to call customer service (who called me back the next day with a correct answer) and do some research on amazon through the customer questions to figure out. Also - when you are heating the oven for air frying or baking, there is a three-beep chime that lets you know the oven reached its temperature. The chime is very quiet - if you're more than 15 feet away from the oven or there is other noise going on, you're not going to hear it.We've used this oven every day since we bought it. So far we have used it for toasting, baking, reheating, and airfrying. I didn't want an oven with a rotisserie and room enough for an entire pizza - that was just over the top. This one works really well for our purposes.The oven is rather tall - of course even though you read the dimensions, it sometimes just is bigger than you pictured. There is only about 3 inches clearance between the top of the oven and bottom of the upper cabinets. A little more snug than I would have liked but it's okay.It cleans up very easily. Comes with a baking tray, toasting rack, and airfryer basket. Everything still looks brand new and has all been used multiple times a day every day for the past 3-4 weeks.I did a lot of research online and surveyed about 5 close friends that owned air fryers. Very pleased with the quality and the price of this oven. Worth the effort to do the research so you get what you expect!",

                "reviewTitle": "In-depth feedback - PWR Button* Cosori 26Quart convection oven/airfryer, 2year Warranty",
                "reviewText": "It's important to know this model has POWER and optional PREHEAT buttons. Two models are currently on Amazon under the same name but different listings yet this one is more expensive and could use a closer price, confusingly the product images and descriptions are identical (I know because I ordered both). The other model has automatic PREHEAT on each started function that will beep when heated and needs the start button pressed again, whereas this version will just cook without the prompt and seems faster to use and arguably isn't needed since the oven heats up quickly. Another button only on this is SHAKE that sets a beep to go off at half the time listed when pressed, so you might flip or \"shake\" your food. The fan also turns off sooner when powered off on this model. Though the button labelling is different between the two, the large digital display is the same on both and something really appreciated because they're often too small or not well lit.The performance is great since it heats quickly to every temperature and more uniquely can hit 450F but also dehydrator and ferment levels of 80F. Six total elements are used differently on each function, ie two bottom/two top on bake, four top on air fry, but the fan can be toggled to max on all the modes allowing \"air fry\" convection heat to whatever temperature or element pattern you want.The build quality is excellent with a thick brushed stainless steel frame on all sides, actually identical to a Frigidaire model still available (who is making it?). Heat insulation is very good without any problems to laminate cabinets on the sides or top, even within an inch. There are also insulation strips layered between the door which many countertop ovens don't have. It's important to mention a review reporting the interior roof metal warping but it's the first thing I tested but didn't see any issue.As for the optional smart connectivity through the app on Android/iOS, it also connects through Google/Alexa and I would imagine someone thinking it was a good idea if they want to start it remotely and have some roasted potatoes ready when arriving home, but according to the manual, no. Remote control is only for after manually starting it, \"for safety reasons\", and generally seems to be for anyone who would want to choose a specific recipe within the app and have the settings set automatically. You can also toggle things like the LIGHT and POWER OFF, temperature and time, but personally seems like too much and wouldn't you really need a camera to make it useful?Overall, an excellent choice that cooks food perfectly, evenly, and costs much less in energy and time compared to conventional ovens. If you have a noisy rattling fan out of the box (surprisingly common), don't hesitate and just use the Return and Replace option. It should cost around $250 CAD (or $200 on sale) and supports a 2year warranty - more than most other options except for what I think is the closest competitor, the overpriced large Cuisinart at 5year (ranging from $300 on sale to $500). Consider getting an extended 4year warranty on Amazon for currently $36 rather than throwing your money away after only a couple years, sometimes smaller brands can just close shop and dissapear.",
