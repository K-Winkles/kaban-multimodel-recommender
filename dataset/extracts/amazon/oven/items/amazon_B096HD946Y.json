I mostly used my microwave before this. Not everything is good cooking it in a microwave. Thus, the toaster oven. It works great. I purchased a heat pad for under it to protect my countertop, since the outside does get hot. I wish I would have purchased additional cooking containers, for the convection mode setting. The flat trays included are hard to clean, but doable. thank you.",

                "reviewText": "We moved our old toaster oven off the counter to make room to play with another coffee maker, and I decided it would not go back, we would replace it since it was pretty old (about 30 years!)After spending months and months trying to decide among what seems like millions of options, I happened upon the black stainless model and we both liked the look and features, so it was a done deal.We love the look, and the stainless isn't bright and shiny, but more of a fingerprint-proof finish. Very nice.As for performance, we are ecstatic- the first thing I did was toss 6 slices of old bread in there to see if there was any odor, which is a very common problem with new appliances these days. The toast came out GREAT, and there was barely any odor at all, not enough to ruin even the first bread tested. We've used it to heat a few other items such as frozen snacks and tonight home made grinders, and this thing rocked every time!The ONLY complaints I have - and they are both very minor: 1. The manual does NOT tell much about the oven other than the required safety BS... I had to figure out on my own that turning the power knob to \"timed\" cooking is not reversible- you'll have to let the timer count down in order to shut off- you instead turn the knob to the LEFT to enter the constant-on state. The words are clearly marked on the oven, it's just something they don't mention. The other issue- again, very minor- is just the marker on the knob to set the temperature could be a little more defined; it is a dot instead of a line, not a big deal.My favorite feature is the convection fan included in this model. You simply turn the dial to the icon with the fan or the one without for each feature such as broil, etc. so you can really keep the browning even on any dish.This is really a great oven for this price range, out of all the choices we sifted through we're really happy we chose this one.",

                "reviewText": "Our first Cuisinart toaster oven worked nicely for three years until a sparks and a small flame shot out from the cord at the back of the toaster. The new ones have the cord attached at the bottom so obviously we were not the only ones with the fire hazard experience.After waiting over an hour to speak with a representative at Cuisinart, they offered nothing, not even a discount on a new one. The warranty was only two years.We ordered a replacement Cuisinart toaster oven. The first toaster oven arrived dented, although the box was not. The second Cuisinart toaster oven was not dented, but the elements didn\u2019t heat up. The third Cuisinart toaster oven arrived with the identical dent and non dented box, plus the heating elements did not heat. Our Cuisinart relationship is over for any product.The same types of negative reviews about poor quality were copious amongst toaster ovens of all brands. The size of the newer models are counter space limiting as well.We ultimately purchased a beautiful Krupp\u2019s four slice toaster that toasts every type of bread and bun to perfection. The construction is quality, it functions consistently, takes up less counter space and, did I mention, it\u2019s gorgeous to look at everyday?Anything that we could do with a toaster oven can be done in our convection oven/microwave. Plus we saved money by going with just a toaster.All of the misery of schlepping three toaster ovens to UPS turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Amazon was incredibly user friendly in this debacle.",

                "reviewText": "I do just about all my oven cooking with this device. I mostly use the convection mode where a fan churns the heat around and cooks food faster. I wish the stainless rack was narrower though. Depending on what I'm cooking the food can fall though like fish would fall though...If the rack had the bars closer together the food would stay on top and not fall though so I use a foil to keep food in place. That is my only complaint.",

                "reviewText": "With only one offset rack and two rack slots, it's very inflexible when it comes to toasting or broiling. So far nothing toasts or broils even. Both take minutes to heat up to proper temperature, so so this is not an oven you set, load, and walk away from. Inside height is also much smaller than what you get with a oven like that from Black+Decker, which is what I replaced with this.All in all, not up to Cuisinart's usual standard. Poor design.",
