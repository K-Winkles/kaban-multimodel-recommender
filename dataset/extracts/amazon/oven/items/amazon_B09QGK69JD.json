                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Like the general construction, but...",
                "reviewText": "I'd been hunting for a larger capacity countertop convection oven, that was built to last, but not costing several thousand dollars. I was immediately attracted to the logical/better build and simple 2-knob control, that makes this oven intuitive to use, straight out of the box. Love the double-pane glass door w/ rubbery sealing gasket, solid metal construction of the unit, quiet fan and a heavy duty power cord. I love that I can put pans or sheets in it, that could handle baking 1 dozen cookies at a time. It runs on 1600W, so has no issues being plugged into a household outlet. Also, I very much appreciate that the oven was sent to me very quickly. While some may like the stainless, mirror finish, I'm not enthused--I can never get these kinds of surfaces completely clean! Since it just arrived today, I can't comment too deeply on the quality of the how it works. I grabbed a frozen pizza and shoved it into the oven, to test. I noticed two things immediately: 1) Both the top and the bottom crust seemed to be crispier than in my recently defunct countertop oven; and 2) Although I set it for close to 400 F degrees, the oven only went to 375 F, and kept the temp. there, the entire cooking time. I don't know if this is a defect, or if the oven is deliberately designed to heat up 25 F degrees less than what is set, because it's a convection oven. I do have a minor complaint. The oven was packed into the box with a small 4\" radius & 3/4\" deep dent in the upper left corner side (near the top of the door). The box was torn and roughed up a bit, but nothing of the box's damage, corresponded to this dent. So some quality control issues there. It doesn't seem to affect the seal of the door, so I decided to try ordering a less than $20 car dent puller (aka 'suction cup') device off Amazon. Hopefully, it'll fix/improve the cosmetic damage. I very highly encourage purchasing the 4 yr. Asurion warranty to go along with this oven, just in case it lasts the same as the more lightweight, annually recycled ovens you can buy at the big box stores.Update: 9/12/22Now that I've played with the oven for 11 days, and used 2 different dent pulling kits on it (got my dent shrunk to 1 1/2\"), I accept I'll never be able to get the corner dent completely fixed. But at least, with my test baking, I can confirm it's limited to cosmetic damage. The only other thing to add, is that the calibration of the oven, will only allow it to go to 440 F degrees max, not 500F. Since I usually bake/roast between 325F-425F, I don't mind so much that it doesn't have the full range of heat. The oven's the perfect size for our family use, and I can compensate for the lower temp readings, with turning up the heat dial + using an oven thermometer. Once you fiddle with the dial to where you want the heat, the temp will stay consistent, which is nice. Aggravating not to get an oven in perfect condition, but it works well enough for me, and would be an incredible pain to repack/lug back to UPS or Kohl's for a return; the 26.5\" x 25.75' x 21\" box weight is close to 60 lbs., and quite an awkward size to manhandle, even with built-in handle holes in the box. The oven design/engineering team did a good job. I may be harping on this, but whomever is boxing the product needs to review why damaged products are being sent out.Update: 9/30/23I have now owned the oven for over a year. It's a little sad to think that, in receiving a dented oven, I was one of the luckier customers. My initial complaint about shipping quality and non accurate calibration are/were the only issues. I'm also thankful that I spent the extra $80 for an Asurion extended warranty. Reading other customers' negative experiences, I am now a convert to purchasing an extended warranty for moderately expensive electronics. I don't know if it mattered with my oven's maintenance and continued performance, but I follow the instruction booklet's directive to unplug it, when not in use. Since it's on a wire rack/wheeled cart, I can easily pull it forward from the wall to reach the receptacle. It's also better for putting more space between the wall and steam venting hole at the back of the oven, when in use. Plus, I like being able to get things out of the oven without having to bend at the waist.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this because it was cheaper than replacing my wall oven which has very few options for purchasing a new oven due to the pre-existing cabinet cut-out dimensions. It works alright. I do a lot of baking as I sell cookies as a cottage food baker. The oven does not cook evenly. I do have to rotate the cookie sheets. This still doesn't fix the issue with the cookies on the outer sides to cook faster than those in the center. I found it best to put fewer cookies than I normally would on the tray even though more would fit.When the oven arrived 2 of the racks were bent, one more than the other and there were some scratch marks as well on the oven (one by the handle and one on the side). I contacted customer service to see if they could just replace the one badly bent rack, as it rattles like crazy when in the oven. They told me to just bend it back into position if possible... I just leave it out of the oven and do not use it.That being said, I decided to keep the oven as it was priced much better than many others but I'm not sure if I'd buy from this company again.",

Oven for a while and just bit the bullet and ordered this one. To my surprise it\u2019s worked pretty wellIt took a while for me to configure the temperature changes but I\u2019ve figured out if you bake your macs at 250F then they\u2019ll rise with no issues. In a regular oven I bake at 275-285, so keep in mind to go a bit lower than your average mac temp.As for the sizing you can fit half sheet pans and they fit perfectly in the grooves, although I opted for UNOX trays which are more flat & will give you perfect macs every single time. (Only used 3 trays at once)Please note I haven\u2019t went higher than 350F so I can\u2019t comment on whether it\u2019ll bakes cakes as well but I\u2019m sure it does! If you can bake macs then you can pretty much bake everything else. Hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "Ero entusiasta di questo forno quando \u00e8 arrivato 2 mesi fa. Credevo che le prestazioni valessero il prezzo. Finalmente potevo cuocere i miei lievitati su pi\u00f9 piani contemporaneamente e cos\u00ec ho fatto... peccato che da un lato il cibo abbrustolisce e dall'altro fatica a cuocere. Per le alte temperature devo occupare solo una parte del forno e girare frequentemente le teglie. Contrariamente a quanto si dichiara per i forni a convezione questo forno impiega anche pi\u00f9 tempo a cuocere. Ho contattato il venditore il quale mi ha dato risposte evasive e inconcludenti. Peccato",
