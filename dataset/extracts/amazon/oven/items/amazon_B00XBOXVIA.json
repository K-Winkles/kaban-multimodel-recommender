                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars So far, I am in love with this oven.",
                "reviewText": "Mine just arrived today, and I am in love with it. If it was legal, I would marry it. I bought it as a stand in for a defective oven in the house I rent. While I work on getting the landlord to replace the bad stove/oven unit, I needed something I can cook in that is not going to burn my house down. So, toaster oven and an induction cook top is my solution. Not to mention that these both will be useful after the stove issue is resolved. I have been debating getting a toaster over for literally a couple of years and with my ever-climbing electric bill, only cooking for one, and my oven being defunct, I decided to go for it.Then the questions became...Which one?How big?Features?I REALLY did not want to spend this much on a toaster over. But I couldn't bring myself to buy and El Cheapo, and then hate it for being not big enough, not having features I want as a serious cook, etc. Then reliability complaints about just about every model toaster oven on the market.I read review after review, on and off Amazon, and ultimately the reviews on both thesweethome.com and Cook's Illustrated sold me on the Breville. It was a toss up between the Breville and the Cuisinart TOB-260N1. There were a couple of deciding factors that led to the win for Breville. One was the fact that the Breville has a replaceable bulb for the light. The Cuisinart does not have a replaceable bulb. Another factor was the display. A lot of people didn't care for the display on the Cuisinart and liked the display on the Breville far better. Lastly, there were a number of complaints about the overall construction of the Cuisinart and general quality control. i.e. Inconsistent gap around door, etc.So I decided that for the sake of about $50 over the life of the unit, I would take the plunge and buy the Breville. I am very glad I did. I still have some reservations about longer term quality, but time will be the judge on that score.Much of why I like it is a direct result of just how bad my oven was. However, this thing is still pretty darned great on its own merits. It heats up fast, does not dry out my frozen pizzas, makes reasonably decent toast, and will do pretty much anything I would need a full-sized oven for, with a perhaps an exception here or there.First thing I did was cook a 12\" frozen pizza. It came out perfect. I can't wait to try a fresh made pizza. There was the slightest of uneven doneness right at the front of the oven, which I solved by giving the pizza a 180 degree turn a couple of minutes before it was done. And that was more an issue of me being picky than anything else. Then I made toast. It makes toast as well as my starting-to-flail Cuisinart toaster. Perfect toast was so far down my list as to not really be factor. One doesn't buy a toaster oven for perfect toast, if one really wants success. (My opinion, of course.) This makes more than adequate toast for me. I can always whip out the old toaster if I want to get picky about it.I have an addiction to Trident brand fish sticks sold at my favorite warehouse store. ADDICTION, I tell you. But I hated trying to cook them in my nightmare oven. Cooked unevenly, burning the crap out of them before heating them through. Not to mention heating a huge oven for a few fish sticks. So I am just over the moon excited to try cooking fish sticks in my Breville tonight.I have only done a couple of things with it today as a test run, but my first impressions are really favorable. I am confident this will do everything that I expect and want it to do.Initial impression of manufacturing quality is very good. Nothing weird. No parts that don't quite fit. No obviously poorly made parts. Instructions are good. I find it very easy to use, although I did actually read the manual first. I love, love, love the oven light.I have found that my fancy Oxo 9 x 13 cake pan does not fit in it. There is a rim on that pan that doesn't clear the light on the inside. And my 13 1/8 th inch pizza stone does not fit, by a hair. Not a surprise. I expected that, based on the specs. Not a big deal for me. I will get a cake pan that fits, and a little bit smaller pizza stone. Just something to bear in mind on larger pans with rims or handles that might not clear the light or make for a tight fit.Edit: I realized that I had tried to put my OXO 9 x 13 pan in on the middle rack. Doh! It would actually be used on the bottom rack position. Not the middle. So it does actually fit.All in all, I am super pleased with this toaster over. It isn't even as big as I was thinking it would be. I was thinking it would be tank-like on my counter, but it actually fits very nicely and doesn't look monstrous. It's a very attractive unit, to boot.Time will tell on longevity. I do have some concerns there. I have also yet to do any serious cooking in it, so we will see how this holds up to expectations. With those caveats, I would already recommend this product as a serious contender for someone looking for a countertop oven that will see real duty.",

                "reviewText": "We haven't owned our Breville for very long, but so far it exceeds our expectations. We use a toaster oven for the majority of our cooking. When our old Avant\u00e9 Elite began to cook unevenly, it was time for a replacement. After reviewing dozens of others, we decided to splurge on the Breville Smart Oven Pro. It's slightly larger than our old oven while still fitting onto our cramped counter space. It's easy to operate with the LED display and function, temperature, and time knobs. This oven preheats quicker than any other toaster oven we've owned. It's quiet, even on the convection setting, cooks evenly, makes perfect toast, and is a breeze to clean. We highly recommend this Breville Smart Oven Pro!",

                "reviewText": "I had heard that the Breville line of \"toaster ovens\" were the best, but I had still put off owning one, simply because of the price. Now I question why I even bothered with the others. The Breville Smart Oven Pro is a convection oven, as my last toaster oven claimed, but it is worlds apart from Black & Decker/Hamilton Beach/Oster models because it actually works well as a small oven. I'm not talking about reheating, broiling, and toasting -- I'm talking about real baking and roasting in addition to those. The reason this oven is such a success is the wide array of options that are fine-tuned to the specific task you need.The main settings for the Breville are toast, bagel, bake, roast, broil, cookies, pizza, reheat, warm, and slow-cook. Within some of those categories, you can choose \"frozen\" -- that is, the oven heats the food prior to cooking it. For example, I can choose bagel, which toasts on one side, or frozen bagel, which heats the bagel before toasting it. You can select 1-6 slices of toast for optimal performance. You can cook with or without convection. (I almost always use convection, although a recipe that requires a precise time would be better without.) An interior light illuminates when the food is done or when you manually turn it on. The smooth dials, coupled with an illuminated digital display, make everything easy and inspired confidence that the oven will actually last longer than the cheaper models I've had in the past.The oven's interior is spacious but not huge. The main interior, taking away the jut-outs that hold the racks, is 13.5\" wide and 11 3/4 deep, but there's a rounded cut-out in the back to make room for the end of a 13\" pizza pan. The oven comes with said 13\" pan, with about 12\" of usual space, and a two-piece broiler/drip pan. It has one rack which can be placed in one of three positions. It's probably big enough to cook a roast chicken or turkey breast; since I don't tend to roast meat often, that's not something I've tried. My 9\" x13\" pans are a little too large for the oven because they have lips with handles. Keep in mind that most pans measure the interior area and not the whole pan when supplying measurements. A disposable foit pan of that size should be no problem. I love that the rack, when placed in the middle position, gets pulled out by the door when you open it.The oven does get hot on top, and care must be taken to pull the oven away from walls to give some clearance around all sides for the heat to dissipate.If you think of this as an auxiliary oven and not a toaster, it's worth every penny. It preheats quickly and cooks evenly. The stainless body is heavier and better built than my previous stainless toaster oven, giving me confidence that it will last. I love that it is a much more efficient option than my wall oven for smaller baking/roasting tasks. Yes, it gets hot, but it certainly doesn't heat my kitchen up the way my oven does. I'm looking forward to using it in the summer months for exactly that reason.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",

                "reviewText": "This Breville Toaster Oven replaces a previous Breville, which I'd had for 15 years of excellent use. (The elements burned out, but all digital controls worked perfectly.) As in the previous item, it heats quickly, produces excellent results for a range of baking foods, has easy digital controls with bright digital displays and is attractive. This is my \"primary\" oven as it makes little sense to use my standard and very large oven - especially in the heat of summer.The pricing was nearly a hundred dollars less than another store. Delivery was in 48 hrs. With good care, this oven should last a decade or more.",

                "reviewText": "This is not a compact toaster oven so look else where if you want a compact one.It has been almost a year, and this is not only a good looking oven, but it is well made, well design, and most importantly has all of the ergonomic features and functions. It does what is was made to do and it does it well.!Toasts are toasted evenly and according the the browning setting.Bake item are baked evenly; as good if not better than a full size oven.The broil setting browns as a broiler should do.This is like a mini version of a full size oven without the bulky size. Great if you need to cook something extra while the main oven is busy with your rack of primerib. Great if you want to heat something small and don't want to turn on big oven. It toast bread, bagel, bake pizza, bake cookies (have not tried yet).Lights comes on when you open the cover to put in your food. Turns off one it's start cooking. Comes back on a few seconds before the cooking is completed with beeping indicator!Magnets on the door pull out the wire rack without hinges or other do hickies!All of the features are intuitive to use and make sense. The amount of details that went into the design this oven is incredible! Nothing is missing.Cleaning tray is easily accessible and clean in less than 10s.Breville got this right and it is well worth the price.I rarely rate anything so high, but Breville got this so right (at least with the Smart Oven Pro), and wish other company (K A, De L) would follow suit. A little healthy competition to breed innovations.",
