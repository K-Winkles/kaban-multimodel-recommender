                "reviewText": "I got this for the metal rack, which is the perfect size for my large Pyrex glass baking pan (3 quart).The metal pan is nice, too, but I got it to have a raised metal rack for my large Pyrex glass baking pan.The sides of the Pyrex glass baking pan are sloped, so the bottom is smaller, hence the need for this size of metal rack, which nobody makes other than this one as part of a rack and pan set.I tried other \"cookie racks\", but they were too large--even at 11\" x 8\"--or they were too small. I have smaller metal racks for my 2-quart Pyrex glass baking pans, and they are nice but are too small for the larger 3-quart Pyrex glass baking pan.This metal rack fits nicely in the bottom of my large 3-quart Pyrex glass baking pan.I use it for fried chicken, where I fry the chicken in a cast iron skillet for 3 minutes on each side to crisp it and then switch to baking for an hour to cook the now crispy fried chicken. This ensures a golden brown outside without over browning. If you don't tell anyone about the technique, then they think it's all fried. This way you get the crispy outer crust from frying without overdoing it, since you finish with baking at 300-degrees to 325-degrees Fahrenheit for an hour or so, depending on how much chicken and the size of the pieces--if large thighs cook longer, but drumsticks not so long. The result is perfect fried chicken. The metal rack ensures it's crisp and cooked evenly top and bottom.",

                "reviewText": "The tray that came with my Cuisinart toaster over was in sad shape after years of use. This tray is well-made, solid, and very easy to clean. It also comes with a grill-top, which my old one did not have. I have found that to be a very useful addition. I haven't had any issues with warping, which some other trays I saw at Amazon have had. The highest temperature I have used it at is 400 and I am careful to wait until it is completely cool before I wash it or soak it. I do line the tray with foil, but it is so easy to clean that I suspect that's unnecessary. Well worth the very reasonable price!",
