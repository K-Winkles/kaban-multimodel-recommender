Whether I\u2019m air frying, baking, or toasting, this oven delivers consistent and impressive results. The array of settings is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to cook a variety of dishes to perfection.The air frying feature is particularly impressive. It crisps up food beautifully without the excess oil, making healthier meals without sacrificing taste. The oven\u2019s capacity is generous, accommodating substantial portions, which is great for family meals or entertaining.However, I\u2019ve noticed a slight issue with durability. After some use, the area around the door has begun to discolor slightly. This doesn\u2019t affect the oven\u2019s functionality, but it is noticeable against the otherwise sleek and clean appearance of the brushed stainless steel.Despite this minor cosmetic concern, the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro is a top-performer. It\u2019s a fantastic choice for anyone looking to invest in a multi-functional oven that can handle a wide range of cooking tasks with ease.",

                "reviewText": "I waited a long time to buy an airfryer and this Brevel was out of my budget until Christmas time. It went on sale and there was no questions about buying this unit. It has been GREAT.You try and error because it is not the same cook temp/time as an oven you are familiar with. Once you learn how to use it you'll be as happy as my whole family. It's used once a day if not twice a day.Because of its versatility, we use it more than our oven.Baking cookies and cakes is OK, but that is not what we bought it for. AIRFRY......Snack foods, vegetables, roasted potatoes, toast, croissants, hot sandwiches, etc, etc, etc. Oh yeah....13\" Std size Frozen pizza \ud83d\udc4d.This top of the line Brevel BOV900BSS I don't know if I would pay current price but it is 5 Star Quality, Performance, Ease of Use & Easy to Clean.",

                "reviewText": "We are really enjoying our air fryer. It is easy to use and easy to clean. After the first use we realized that we need to line the bottom tray with aluminum foil to catch the grease and food that dropped on it so it is much easier to clean up each time. I love the diversity of this appliance. So many ways to cook. It also has a convection option and a frozen option. When you hit the frozen option it automatically changes the time and the temperature to accommodate the change. So far we have used the airfryer and the pizza option and the broiler. They all worked well so far. The air fryer works best when you use a single layer and only one rack although it will work if you want to use two racks if you keep shifting the top and bottom racks.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this when our wall oven quit on us around Thanksgiving 2 years ago. Even in a small kitchen we found a corner perfect for accommodating the door swinging down to open. Has many features to choose from and once we acquainted ourselves with the machine we have used it often. In summer it is nice to not have to use the (now new) wall oven & generate excessive heat. Is the perfect size for smaller portioned meals. We love the air fryer feature in particular. All the pans fit in the dishwasher. Big trays like a half-sheet cake pan or a large roaster will not fit but that is the trade-off. Foods cook pretty evenly but not as well as our $3000 convection wall oven, of course, but the power saved in the Breville is worth it. The timer buzzer is very loud for certain! Just this month I purchases the cutting board with silicone feet to place on the oven. It is made to fit the Breville and allows me to sit things on top now that otherwise would have overheated or simply melted and it finishes off the corner spot so well now that I can use that space. After getting the new wall oven, we decided to keep the Breville for its convenience and usefulness for 2 people like us and great for larger parties when an extra oven surely comes in handy.",

                "reviewText": "After a TREMENDOUS amount of research into air fryer ovens, I decided on this Breville. I\u2019m certainly glad I did!! As I normally cook just for myself, I was sick of having to turn on my big old oven, heating up my kitchen and wasting a ton of electricity. This unit has completely replaced my oven and stand alone air fryer with flying colors. My favorite features are its capability to hold full size casserole dishes as well as half sheet pans and other large vessels. The proofing function is most helpful to me as during the winter, dough has trouble rising due to the room temperature. I had an Instant Vortex Oven previously which I did like a lot, but I have more room, control and functions with this Breville. Very high quality, temperature seems to read true, foods cook a bit quicker than in a standard oven, air fryer function is great. So glad I did my research, I feel I made the right decision, especially at this price point!",

                "reviewText": "We live the full time tiny home life, we purchased this as a full time oven, this is the best purchase we've made for this lifestyle. The door actually seals all the way, the heat is perfectly accurate, it's extremely easy to set up and it looks amazing. The price of this nearly scared us away, we purchased the larger sized one, I'm so glad we went with it.As soon as you start pulling it out of the box you can see, and feel, the difference in quality. We were using one of those cheaper convection ovens and compared to this we may as well have been using a candle under a plate. We've burned through a lot of ovens, of varrying quality, and this is hands down the best we've purchased. It maintains an even temperature, though it does remind you to turn your food, and can even fit our Dutch oven with the lid on. The other extra wide oven we used couldn't fit the lid and took forever to cook anything in it.If you're using this for the tiny home lifestyle I highly recommend it, we have been blown away by the quality of the oven and how well if evenly cooks our foods. You can tell they put a lot of thought into making this and it's on a totally different level compared to all of its competitors. I can't speak as to how long the oven lasts, we've only had it for a few weeks, but you can see it's build to last a lifetime. If you're only using it part time you may want to go with something cheaper, it you're looking for something to actually use as an oven then hit the buy now button, you won't regret it.Edit on February 16th 2023.This over is still going strong and works exactly like it did when we bought it. We use it heavily and none of the markings have worn off and it still cooks to perfection. This is hands down the best Amazon purchase I\u2019ve ever made.",

It replaces an older model from a different manufacturer that was good, but the temps were off (esp in baking mode) This model does a great job on everything I've tried so far, including baking, broiling, proofing (who knew I needed this), and air frying. the interior dimensions are great - 16inches across, 12inches (front to back), plus an extra inch rounded for 13\" pizza pan. It was a toss-up between this model and the newer smarter Joule (but the Joule has a smaller interior space) My goal is to use this oven as my primary oven, with the large/standard oven reserved for when I need the space so interior size was important to me.",
