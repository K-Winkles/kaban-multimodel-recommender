I resisted buying an air fryer because I didn't want another one use appliance, so I looked long and hard before settling on this option. I use it almost every day sometimes multiple times. It bakes very well, and the air frying function comes from the convection option. It has a large enough space for a large lasagna and is so versatile I am constantly discovering new uses for it. In the summer months when I don't want to turn on the over, it is terrific. I don't know how I got along without it!",

                "reviewText": "I bought a brand new one and it has been great except that it is impossible to clean the interior. It seems to be aluminum inside but I\u2019m not sure. The instructions booklet says not to use abrasive cleaners and not to put cleaning solution directly on the interior walls. Cleaning solution should be applied directly on the sponge used to clean the interior. Well, anything that splashes grease during cooking is going to splash it all over the inside of the oven and a soft sponge with cleaning solution on it is not going to do the job. Consequently, you will end up with a dirty oven and no way to clean it. Other than that, my oven has worked perfectly.",
