                "reviewText": "I bought one for myself this summer and gave this updated model to my parents for Christmas. They are thrilled! My mom is relearning to walk after an illness and my stepfather has been most of the cooking and taking care of her. My reason, personally, that I say it changed my life is that I rarely use the oven anymore. My husband and I use this to air fry chicken breasts. Without looking at the directions too closely, I evoo'd, s&p'd, herbed the chicken breasts, hit start and in 15 minutes (no preheat), flat, we had the most amazing, juiciest, flavorful chicken breast we have ever had. I am a great cook, but in order for my chicken to be that juicy and tasty, I would use a vat of chicken broth or the like and have to baste them in the oven. Between the time, the cookware cleanup, and the good - but not THIS good! - chicken, this air fryer has changed my life! Besides that, I don't need to make or buy chicken stock or bone broth to baste my chicken anymore or let my chicken cook in its own fat.We have also used it to heat up pizza, Jamaican patties, tortillas, pita, frozen Brussel sprouts, reheat any veggie actually, potato fries, a chimichanga once - just a lot of things I would usually end up throwing away.The cleanup is way too easy without the parchment insert if you decide to not purchase them. I didn't know that was a thing, so it took a few months to start using a parchment liner, but it still cleaned super easily. Better with parchment, and you can also use regular non-formed parchment paper, to save money.My stepdad is really thrilled with it. It saves him from back ache from opening or shutting the oven door, he will be able to clean it easily, cook healthier to help with his blood pressure and cut down on a lot of work that would otherwise take time away he would rather spend with Mom. I highly recommend this NuWave air fryer. It is SO EASY!! It's brilliant. Worth every penny.",

                "reviewText": "As the single father of a 12 yo daughter, \"acceptable\" suppers often involve things like popcorn shrimp, french fries, chicken nuggets [as a farmer I'm still trying to figure out how they get those \"nuggets\" off the chickens], and similar breaded foods.I really dislike actual deep-frying because the oil smokes and spatters, and is a real pain in the ass to dispose of. My alternative has been to use the oven for baking the frozen products, but it bothered me to fire up the oven for 10 nuggets and a handful of fries. From late spring to early fall it also throws a lot of unwanted heat into the house.This air fryer is not only faster than oil or a conventional over, but also far easier to clean than oil and throws off less heat than the oven. Basically, it's a mini convection oven ideal for small batches. Since I bought it last spring my gas bill is down by 5 bucks a month during a season when the furnace is off.This is a large model costing about $120, so the gas savings pay for it in 24 months. After decades in business, I consider any capital purchase covered by two years' identifiable expense reduction to be pretty much a no brainer.This one sure is. Faster and cleaner are fine bonuses, too. In most circumstances it will be money well spent.",

I've cooked frozen fries, onion rings, chicken tenders, reheated fried chicken, mozzarella sticks, and made quesadillas. They were all fantastic and ready in about ten minutes. I can't believe I've waited so long to get one. Purchase this now! You won't regret it",
