It's a great one stop shop!I am really enjoying it. It isn't compact, by any means, so you'll want to take that into consideration.",

The words on the buttons are completely gone and there is some scratching on the shelving inside. It comes with adequate accessories except one that is crucial. Thermo protective gloves. I burn myself daily. Two of my burning adventures ended with treatments to the ER. Before buying, I read all the comments about the unit being dangerously hot. I knew this but bought it anyway.",

                "reviewText": "Original review: I've had my Nuwave Bravo XL for a few days and I wish I could give it a glowing review, but after less than stellar results I can't. I think that over time, I will learn to work around its quirks. My version came with a number of accessories including a silicone mat and a mesh tray/rack but not an air fryer basket (I can use the mesh rack, though it's not as deep).The first head scratch moment was trying to assemble the racks in it since what I got didn't match the instructions. I'll figure out how best the racks and trays fit and ignore the manual. Note: the manual is easier to follow once you've used the Bravo a few times because you'll be more familiar with the knob and buttons.Tried to make toast, burnt the first and undercooked the second. I make my own bread, so will have to experiment with what will actually work, homemade bread seems to toast differently than store bought.Major issue with the warming function. I wanted to proof my pizza dough and chose the warming function. When chosen, it is supposed to default to 140 degrees for 1 hour. You can easily adjust temperature up or down. I readjusted it to 80 degrees. I followed the instructions. You can see the result in the picture (fortunately my husband noticed before we had a real disaster and only lost the container). When I checked the unit it was set to 350. I thought I had messed up, but have since tried this function, manual in hand and find that it ultimately defaults to 350 for 15 minutes. (I learned from customer service that the warm function kicks in after you've performed another function, i.e. bake at 350 for 15 minutes).So does it cook? Absolutely, but be very watchful until you really figure it out.Update 2/17/23: Company contacted me directly and provided guidance and acknowledged that the manual is not very clear and will look to adjust it in the future. 5 stars for customer service!",
