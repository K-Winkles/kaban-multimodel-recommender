                "reviewText": "This item is sold as being non-stick for the tray below and not non-stick for the metal mesh basket. It comes with a pack of parchemin paper so you don't have to clean the bottom tray too often.What they don't tell you is that you MUST use the parchemin paper! Despite being supposedly non stick, the bottom tray turns out to be impossible to clean!I used it only once to airfry chicken nuggets. I had put a very light spray of oil on the nuggets, less than a table spoon of oil for all of it. The cooking in my convection oven set at 400F went very well.Unfortunately, when it was cleaning time, the little amount of oil I had used was stuck to the bottom tray and there was no way to remove it! I let is soak in degreasing dish solution and nothing came out. I tried really hard for a long time to clean it and it was just stuck there, no way to remove it! The bottom tray was ruined in only one use! Perhaps TSP could get rid of it but I did not want to use a harch chemical for a cooking item.If you are ALWAYS using the provided parchemin paper, you may not have that problem. Otherwise I suggest using it with a different under tray, not the one provided. The box should specify that it cannot be used without the wax paper!I am returning it as I cannot deal with such a difficult cleaning. It's too bad as the basket does work well and cleans easily, and it does fit in my Black and Decker counter top convection oven!",
