It cooks great and fast; operating it is so so easy and you can operate it using your phone in the couch or in your bedroom relaxing using the vesync app. My only reason for returning it was the size. It is too small for me; I have a big family. I'd wanted to keep it but I don't have space for it. This is how bad I love this air fryer.The outside of this air fryer doesn't heat up like others that I have used; and this alone makes a huge difference.Please DO NOT hesitate to buy this air fryer. You will never regret you did. It cooks great, very easy to use, and the food no matter what comes out crispy, nice, and delicious. I cook everything from African to whatever.I love it. I highly recommend this Cosori air fryer toaster oven.Thank you.",

                "reviewText": "It's been a couple of months since I bought my Cosori air fryer. I did a couple months of research before buying this model, after purchasing a full sized Cosori convection oven for my daughter's family as a house-warming gift. They really Love their family size Cosori, and I'm rather happy with my own smaller unit as well. I only use it every couple of weeks, since I eat pretty healthy, and still prefer to do my meat and veggies on a gas grill. Originally I bought this because I Love fried fish (I think fish ALWAYS tastes best when it's deep fried). I also wanted to try making healthier egg rolls and wontons. I have to say that the egg rolls and wontons turn out quite well, without having all the grease of deep frying and the cleanup and disposal issues related to deep frying. I'm still playing around with temps and times, but I am impressed with how the food turns out. Things cook much quicker in a convection oven than they do in a regular one, and the smaller size of my Cosori unit means I don't have to heat up my kitchen oven just to cook for one person. The controls are easy to use, and I really like the 'halfway timer' that lets me know when to flip my food. Overall, I think the design of the unit is quite well thought out. I love the link to online recipes and the fact that my phone keeps track of my cooking. Very, very handy! Compared to cooking on a gas grill, I still like the gas grill for roasting vegetables better than using the convection oven. Like others have said, the food still doesn't taste like deep fried - but it is certainly a healthier option that gives you a crispy outer layer while cooking the inside to perfection. I'm still playing around with air frying breaded fish fillets. I haven't perfected that yet. The conventional oven still gives me better results, but I think it's just a matter of time before I hit on the right time/temp/methods to use in my Cosori. I am very pleased with this unit and would highly recommend the Cosori brand. I included two pics of egg rolls I made, and was very happy with the results. I just may have to do some air frying tonight!",

                "reviewText": "Despite a previous review from someone, this fryer will most definitely fry without a preheat if you so desire. It is the perfect size for mid-quantity meals, meaning quick and uniform heating. Much bigger than pull-out fryers but not so big as \"ovens\" that take so long to heat and produce uneven results.AND since this fryer will go to 450 degrees - 50 degrees higher than many fryers - you can set it at 415 and crisp up leftovers or reheat leftovers to the perfect consistency and taste.This baloney that it is hard to learn the controls - not true at all. Very easy. In fact, I prefer these controls over any other fryer I have had. This Cosori fryer is exceptionally nice in all aspects. I hope it lasts longer than 2 years. We will see. But I highly recommend this one!",

I had had one before, but the air fryer part made it hard to clean. I love the airfryer bucket that comes with this one. I use it multiple times a week and it is super easy to clean and stays contained to the bucket. It also toasts to perfection. I have been VERY happy with this purchase.",
