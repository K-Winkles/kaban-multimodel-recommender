Press Convection button, set prefered timing and temperature and press the switching knob to start the process, convection functions equally as air fry. Why does the microwave fan keep running after all the cooking process shuts down? The microwave has a cooling system to prevent the machine from overheated and insure long-term durability, the fan may keep runnnig for up to 3 minutes after cooking is completed depending on the cooking time and modes How to stop/resume/cancel an in-process cooking program? To pause, press once the red Stop/Cancel button to the right of the switch knob. To resume, press the main control switch knob and the cooking command continues. To cancel, press the Stop/Cancel button twice, the unit will be back at reset status. Why does my glass turntable drag while operating/doesn't fit the turntable ring? It's normal that the turntable drags a bit depending on food size and what spot was the food placed, rest assured that it doesn't affect daily use. If the turntable is making unusual noise or you would like a replacement, please reach out to us. Why does the product look different from those in reviews? We have upgraded the design of a few buttons on the panel to make it easier to understand and operate, rest assured that all functions and basic interaction are still the same.",

The food gets hot and the plate is warm after they\u2019re heated, unlike other microwaves which they cause the plate to be super hot and dangerous to grab. It feels really safe. This microwave is high quality as well and I love it so much. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family.",

                "reviewText": "We have had this microwave about 2 months now, after my not-even-a-year-old GE crashed and died, and they wouldn't warranty it. I like this one (it was recommended on CNET, which is how I found it). It's a little more complicated, yes, but it doesn't take long to figure out the basics. I saw someone review it and start by saying something like \"I haven't read the manual and I don't intend to.\" I don't recommend that approach. You should read the manual where the settings are discussed (or at least the quick reference guide). It isn't intuitive, but in exchange you get a fairly clean interface and a compact unit that doesn't swallow the whole countertop. I love, love the defrost function-- it's hands-down the best I've seen in a microwave. The rest are ok. I can do chicken wings on convection, bread on broil, and reheat all sorts of things. I think some of the settings are not necessary, so I just keep the quick guide nearby and use it as a guide (ie I don't notice any difference when I airfry chicken nuggets or french fries on the same setting, except for time, and I check that anyway, so I just pop it on the first one I come to). I love the convect and airfry/micro combinations. They give me crisp food that is also cooked inside. I will use this pretty much exclusively in the summer because I hate firing up my oven when it's hot. A couple of notes:--the unit is not as strong a micro as package times indicate, so you may need to go longer than the cook times on items like frozen veggies. It's nbd (maybe +1 minute), but something to keep in mind.--it doesn't have a sensor (I missed that when I ordered it), so \"reheat\" is just time-based (you need to check the food).--it doesn't get super hot like my old one did around it. That said, I keep it on a heat-proof mat to protect my countertops.--the top heating element is in the back, so food in the middle of the plate (rather than the sides) doesn't get as brown in the oven/broil/airfryer. It must be moved around a bit.If you want something you can just fire up and not think about, I would get a different model (just not the GE, because I'm not the only person that sucker died on for over $400\ud83d\ude21). However, I like how small this is, how nice it looks, and it does a great job for like 95% of what I need. It's also a lot less expensive and, supposedly, will last longer (I'll definitely update if it doesn't). I'm happy with it so far.",

                "reviewText": "So far I\u2019ve been impressed with both functions and ease of use. The first thing I used it for was defrosting 2 chicken leg quarters. No hot spots like other microwaves I\u2019ve used.This morning I made hash browns and then cracked some eggs over the top. It was easy using the convection feature to get crispy hash and the eggs in two additional minutes. No big greasy mess.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this microwave in late November 2022, and am maintaining my original, 3-star review below. This update is from April of 2023. I do not recommend this microwave at all. I have lower usage than average, since I am alone, and air fryer and convection functions I used up till last week now no longer work. For example, I had used the preset air fryer setting for chicken legs, and they were crisp and well-cooked in the past, yet trying the exact same function this week left me with chicken that was raw inside. I successfully cooked meats with convection, much as timing was 'hit or miss,' and the same meat I managed to cook a week ago came out raw inside. My reporting the problem to the vendor led to my being told to be sure food was defrosted and that I used proper cooking times. My last microwave was working well after 17 years - this one failed in a matter of months!I wish I could have replaced the microwave, with grill and roast functions, that I already had, but it was 17 years old, and I feared it might 'die,' so I got this model with a special Cyber deal. I just ruined a steak in it!With my other microwave, I could choose 'grill' or 'roast,' press a number for the type of meat, put in the weight, choose 'rare,' and have the cooking time automatically calculated. This is totally hit and miss. Instructions, and the cookbook, do not list times for broiling or cooking, and the presets are only for air frying and defrosting. Even the air frying presets listed are very limited. I attempted to prepare meat using an air fryer recipe, and it did not work. (I gather that one use 'convection,' enter a temperature and time, and hope for the best.) The 'combi' mode was supposed to give me tender meat, but there is no indication of cooking time for whatever type of meal one is preparing. Pressing 'broil' leads to presets - but the instructions do not say what these presets mean. All times have to be entered manually. The only function I could have used, entering the weight, was defrost - not cooking!I've been using Toshiba products since the 1970s, and thought of them as quality. The inadequate instructions, need to enter cooking times manually (without a clue as to how long it takes), presets that only seem to be for defrosting, and only automatic 'microwave' choices (such as beverage or potato), makes me wonder just how I'm going to prepare meat dishes - and the description on the Amazon page had given me the impression that the 'combi' cooking and 'inverter' would make the meats better than ever.I nearly gave it a '2' rating, but allowed three stars because, with the Prime Deal discount, one could not beat the price.",
