The toaster selector is large easy to see and gives uniform results for same setting every time. I\u2019ve used this daily for over a month now. All the timer/function selectors are the same easy to use eye height knobs and look great imo. I have used all the functions except the grill/griddle and love the ease and results from each. The crumb tray is genius, easily accessed from the outside and a non-stick surface wipes clean! This model has a smaller footprint so saves counter space. I am just thrilled with the engineering, design and functionality!",

                "reviewText": "This type of Cuisinart countertop \u201coven-airfryer-toaster\u201d is available in various versions. Cuisinart has also chosen to create products specific to companies like Costco. I know because I purchased a Costco version of it with a dial and Digital control system for a time and temperature. Unfortunately, it died of premature death due to crappy electronics.Numerous other \u201cDigital\u201d versions are available.This machine, on the other hand, is at the opposite end of the spectrum. It literally uses mechanical clock work timers like an old-fashioned countertop egg timer with a knob.It goes tick-tick!Likewise, the temperature control appears to be old school involving some simple, analog circuitry and a thermocouple.This kind of technology has been around since the 1940s and it is reliable!!!Is it precise? Not so much, but if you are a competent cook, it\u2019s wonderful. My smart phone can serve as a timer. I am OK with possible temperature fluctuations of 25\u00b0 or so.This thing is wonderful. The grill pan is an incredible accessory. I have baked pies in it. made numerous batches of buffalo wings. Roasted half chickens. French fries. Roasted potatoes & Brussels sprouts. Grilled sausages. Meatloaf. Banana bread loaves. Muffins. The list goes on\u2026.Why use a huge oven that takes forever to heat up and uses more energy? Buy this!",

The door was poorly balanced and did not close properly. I read some answers in questions section and figured out that this is indeed an issue not to be ignored. That oven heated and cooked unevenly, back overcooked and front undercooked. The temperature was inconsistent. The first one goes back and replacement arrives. The second one appears to close more tightly and to not steam. Overall this oven is great in its simplicity and effectiveness. The tray easily holds enough food for 4. Hopefully I will get a lot of use from my replacement oven. Would be 5 stars if not for defective first one",

                "reviewText": "My older air fryer toaster oven bit the dust, there were a few things I didn't like about it but in shopping for a new one, a newer version of my old one was looking better and better. Suddenly this popped up and its color matched my kitchen. It was also the size I was looking for as I have a shelf on the wall it must fit on. I figured I'd give it a try. Very glad I did. I use it almost every day. It toasts bread in a jiffy, and it's evenly toasted. I use it to heat things in ceramic bowls up. Heated up pizza slices. I've air fried onion rings, tater tots, French fries and homemade tortillas, all came out excellent. It's quite a powerful little oven. It's designed to have the air fryer basket sit inside a drip tray and most anything you cook, as long as it's not so big as to require the bottom shelf, you can have the drip tray under it, keeping the heating elements clean. It's been a snap to clean it too, never thought I'd say that about any toaster oven. I clean it after each use so the stuff doesn't get baked on. Quick and simple. I highly recommend this little oven!",

                "reviewText": "I have not yet used all of the features this product offers but purchased it because I wanted an air fryer and like the idea of trying and indoor grill. This is a perfect size for a single person or small family. The first use was for air frying chicken wings. My boyfriend, a self proclaimed wings afficionado, immediately commented that he [now] prefers air frying wings over grilling them. The process for figuring out the perfect amount of time took a little practice but we were happy with the results after just a few tries. I've also used this for baking cookies, toasting bread, and warming up leftovers. The time and temp dials could be improved by providing smaller increments for greater accuracy. So far I'm very happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I always hated turning on my large oven for heating up leftovers. Nope, not nuking my food in a microwave. This warms up food quickly and perfectly without heating up the whole kitchen. It gets pizza crust and tortillas to a perfect crisp texture. I hesitated for some time because I didn\u2019t want a big appliance on my counter but it looks nice and really doesn\u2019t take up too much space. Turning on the oven is done by turning the timer which starts at the 10 minute mark so good luck guessing for a shorter time, it\u2019s the only draw back I have come across in my short time using. Look forward to trying some serious cooking, I have high hopes.",

Now I have to find a different one that hopefully is more reliable.",
