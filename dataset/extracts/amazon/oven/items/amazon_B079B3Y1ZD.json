                "reviewText": "I recently bought the Nutrichef Vertical Countertop Rotisserie Oven. I like it very much. So much so, I am making this comprehensive positive review. If you're like me, you will appreciate the depth and scope of my thorough review to help you decide if you want to purchase. First, It came incredibly fast. I ordered it late Sunday night, and it was delivered Tuesday afternoon. Fast delivery aside, I am very impressed with the size of the oven, and with the quality of construction. I read some negative reviews suggesting the construction was sub standard. I disagree with those reviewers. I found it to be constructed very solidly. I like how the curved tempered glass door stays open, when you open it all the way, and shuts by itself, when you put it in any other position besides fully open. Setup was instantaneous, as it was fully assembled right out of the box. You might want to wash the racks, skewers, bowls and pans, as well as the inside of the oven, just to remove any grease or manufacturing residue from the factory. There really didn't seem to be any, but I washed all the accoutrements anyway, just to be safe. The oven comes with everything you could possibly want for making kabobs, for using the rotisserie, and even for baking. I did a 20 minute \"burn in \", to make sure that any fumes or smoke from the initial use did not get on my food. There was a small amount of smoke, when I first turned it on, but it only lasted a few seconds. I like the fact that you can adjust the temperature . I also like the option to set the timer to the \"Stay On\" setting, for slow cooking. Make sure to turn the timer knob counter clockwise to get to the \"Stay On\" position. Don't try to force the dial to go past the 60 minute setting. The timer is very accurate. I cooked a medium sized chicken, and there was room to spare, as you can see from the photo, (attached). I wanted to attach a picture of how neatly it stores away in my cupboard, but you'll have to take my word for it, as I couldn't seem to attach more than one photo. Luckily, I have big cupboards, because this thing is huge! My chicken came out perfectly cooked. It was juicy and tender. The rotisserie motor worked perfectly. I can't really speak to the versatility, as I only cooked one chicken, so far, but I tested the heating elements in both configurations, and in different modes and it worked fine. I've even seen a picture where one element was horizontal and one was vertical. I find the ability to manipulate the heating elements very interesting. That is sure to be useful. I read that a few people thought that this model oven was top-heavy. I agree it may be tipped over easily, if you have a small child, or a michievous cat. That being said, I believe it's perfectly safe, unless acted upon by an outside force. I certainly wouldn't pass up this great bargain, because of a high center of gravity. I just took a little strip of cardboard from the packing material and made a little wedge to place under the front of the oven to make sure my cat doesn't accidentally knock it over. If you look close at the photo I attached, you can see how easily the high center of gravity can be neutralized. One more thing worthy of note is the ease of cleaning. It cools down very quickly, and can be wiped down with a damp paper towel in seconds. All in all, I would recommend it to anybody in the market for a versatile space saving appliance that makes a great addition to your kitchen. It could replace many of your other appliances. It's fun to use, and I feel is well worth the money.",

If you accidentally set it for an hour, but you actually need to set it for 30 mins, I\u2019m not sure if you can reset it. So you have to wait until the timer runs it\u2019s course.

                "reviewText": "I was really excited about this upright rotisserie. However, I noticed that the glass door doesn\u2019t completely close shut. Thus, messing with the temperature because heat escapes through the opening.It took longer to cook a 5 pound chicken than I would\u2019ve in my oven. Also, I noticed that the bottom portion wasn\u2019t cooking the chicken well, as if most of the heat were being emitted on the upper portion of the heating element. I then had to stop the process and adjust the whole chicken higher. Which was a pain to do because it was still hot of course.Clean up was easy, I just wiped the interior down with a damp cloth.Now for the accessories. I noticed that after a couple of washes, they were beginning to rust.The long stake, the skewers, prongs, and the plates had spots with rust starting up.I immediately deemed it unsafe because I wouldn\u2019t attempt to place food on these accessories again, let alone cook with them.I did contact Amazon CS and they had me process a return for a refund. I sent it back and got my money back a few days later.",

                "reviewText": "I had two Ronco's over the pass two years. Neither held up, so I tried Nutruchief. Cleaning is a breeze with the Nutruchief. It has two heating elements, one vertical and one horizontal. With the vertical positioning of a chicken or rib roast drippings do not splatter on sides or back, like Ronco. Always had problems with the Ronco with food rubbing against the heating element and gear slippage. You can also adjust the temperature with the Nutruchief when using the Rostesserie. You cannot do that with Ronco Rostesserie. The Ronco had a tendency to over cook and the chicken was not as moist, all related to the size of the chicken. I bought this to replace my last Ronco which fell apart in about a year. Ronco use to be the gold standard but this much superior at a third of the cost.",

If your not careful the do will slam shut, do to the strong spring if you do not open it all the way and let go. This had happened a couple of times. The door has not broken, I would just like to see a different design of the door. Because the chicken rotates vertical, all the oils drip down nicely but I wonder if it rotated Horizontally like the pro ovens do, if it would not make a better product as the oils would stay more on the chicken. Over all we still love it and use it.",
