                "reviewText": "This is a very nice, modern looking oven. It's a bit deeper and higher than a typical toaster oven so be sure you have a good spot for it in your kitchen. Baking and broiling are comparable to the typical functionality found in toaster ovens. What stands this oven apart is the air fryer feature. A frying tray is included with the oven, and I tested it on some frozen potatoes (French fries and hash browns). The internal fan circulates the hot air around the food, resulting in the \"air frying\". This worked very well but requires some experimentation. Most recipes say to preheat the oven but there's no preheat function. You just have to turn on the oven and give it several minutes to warm up. The length of time you actually \"fry\" food may be stated in a recipe but it's still just guidance.When operating, the oven makes noise from the fan but it's not particularly loud. An internal light is always on when running and you get a good view of your food as it is cooking through the window on the front door. It's well insulated and the air around the oven was not especially hot, although caution is still needed to not touch the metal top and sides of the oven.I've never used an air fryer before, but I can already tell that food cooks faster and some food will cook better than using the baking or broiling feature in a typical toaster oven.",

I have to disclose that I am VERY opposed to using microwaves, so I often cook or re-heat things in the oven. However this convenient Air Fryer/Toaster Oven allows me to quickly cook and heat things. So far I've only used it for toasting garlic bread and re-heating, but I'm sure there are TONS of things you can use this for. It's pretty compact, but has generous space, fitting on the counter. Cleanup is easy and it comes with racks, pans and everything you need. This will be great when I need to quickly make my kids a snack or meal.",
