It is definitely an improvement over the very similar model that I bought 2 years ago for a higher price that did not have the air-fryer feature. The controls are easier to use and to read and the air fryer seems to work well and is a nice addition to this oven. I haven't used it enough to discuss cleaning or how durable it is. My only complaint, just like my last B&D oven is that it doesn't toast evenly. The top of toast gets darker than the bottom of the toast. My previous model was tough to clean once it got dirty, so it might be true of this oven, too. I haven't used it enough for it to need cleaning yet. However, I am really happy with the Black and Decker 4-Slice Crisp 'N Bake Air Fry Toaster Oven otherwise and I can recommend it, especially considering its low price, compared with other toaster ovens with similar features.",

                "reviewText": "PRO: It toasts evenly. Your charcoal briquette will be evenly black.I'm at the age where I usually don't need glasses for much but reading certain text. Microwave dinners that print unnecessarily small text on a colored background, stuff like that. But for appliances: microwave, range, dishwasher, washer and dryer, I don't need them at all -- all mainstream products, no \"vision impaired\" versions here.But this toaster oven has small, skinny black text on stainless. So I first have to get my glasses, then crouch down directly in front of it to see the entire dial. OK, so I'm a fossil, but still, the knobs protrude so far, that if it's on a countertop, you can't see the lower part of the dial without crouching. (If you use it at eye-level, it's not a problem.) The air-fry setting is incomprehensibly a printed gray box with the text cut out to show stainless letters, where there's nearly zero contrast between the box and stainless. It's like inviso-text!For toast, it requires you to turn the timer past 10, then back to the toast setting, and although there are indicators of desired toastiness, they have no correlation to the end result. Anything but nearly white will burn, and there's so little of a knob-twist between burned and hot bread that it's impossible to get consistent results. You just have to stand and watch and pull it out when it's what you want. Which is a pity, because it toasts more evenly than any other toaster oven I've used. OTOH, it also seems to get hotter on the outside than some others.This is yet another product seemingly designed by kids (*shakes fist*) with perfect vision, who've neither taken an industrial design course, nor actually used a product of this type; Needless to say, it's look real cool.",

It was burned and turned black on the 1st use. The burned oil on the pan does not come off. I wish I can return, but I used it unfortunately.",
