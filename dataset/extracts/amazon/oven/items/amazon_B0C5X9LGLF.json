For example, the manufacturer confirmed when broiling BOTH burners are used \"to heat the food evenly.\" I haven't tried the dual heat and probably wont bother at this point.SO it is an air fryer that ACTS more like an oven in daily use. It does cook well and hasn't failed to deliver so I will be keeping it foremost in my kitchen. If the coating on the basket holds up (wash VERY gently) for another couple years I will come back and up my review another star or so.(Also the manufacturer confirmed the top burners do not get visibly \"red hot\" because of the fan blowing down on them. Other info on youtube seems to confirm this is often true in air fryers and types of burners in general.)",

                "reviewText": "My girl threw away our microwave and toaster. She loves it and very pleased with this choice.She says it\u2019s a super high quality and the accessories are excellent (pan, basket, and rack).It keeps temperature well. It's well-insulated and doesn't require a heat mat underneath it. It's attractive. Super easy to clean with the pull-out. And she likes how it saves her space on our kitchen counter.Her only downside is the way you\u2019ve to cycle through the mode. She wished if it was touch or physical buttons for more convenience.4 stars from her due to the buttons situation, 5 stars from me because i loved all the food came out of it \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffcWe both recommend it \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
