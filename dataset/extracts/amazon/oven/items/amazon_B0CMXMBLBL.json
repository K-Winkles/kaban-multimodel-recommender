It will take a while to get used to cooking stuff that\u2019s not an option, but I\u2019m learning that it\u2019s fairly easy to figure out the temp and times due to the options they have.

                "reviewText": "First, please remove all of the front stickers from the unit before you use it. I could tell by some of the reviews that those stickers were left on and this interferes with the operation of the air fryer. The digital display is very straightforward and alternates showing you the cooking time and temperature. I does have a pre-heat function, so you want to make sure to add your food after. Use the light button to cut on the interior light so you can watch your food cook without having to open it and stop the cooking process. It worked just fine. I don't think that it is as intuitive to use as my other air fryers. You will need to read the manual for this one. It came with a nice recipe book, so you have a starting point. Overall, it is a pretty decent fryer.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first air fryer amd I am in love with it! It is larger capacity than others I have seen, and is very easy to operate. The 12 pre-settings are really handy, too. I used the 'fries' setting for tator tots last night, and it turned out perfectly crispy tots. Today, I used the custom time/temp setting (very easy to do), for grilled cheese sandwiches and it worked great. It even alerted me to flip the sandwiches over.The body of the unit is different than expected...I know I ordered white as it stated in the advertisement, but thi picture almost looked like stainless...it is in fact a very nice white. The texture is different...almost like the 3D printing texture you see on 3D printed toys. I actually like it. The matte looks very nice. The window is large and the light is bright...and it shuts itself off automatically so you don't leave the light on too long...but the actual window is not as large as the images make it appear. The black is there, but the actual window is half the size pictured, and much of the black is just framing. The drawer is very large and easy to handle, the handle itself large and easy to grasp.It is easy to clean. I washed the 'basket' (really just a flat grid with holes and a handle) with dish soap and rinsed and dried it. I wiped most of the oil and crumbs from the drawer and then washed with a soapy cloth and carefully rinsed. It states that this is dishwasher safe, but it doesn't really appear to be in person and I would just rather wash and dry it myself. Overall, I really like this. It is fun and easy to use, easy to take care of, and looks nice. 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have been wanting a new air fryer for a while now. I have one that\u2019s 10+ years and the inside is all rusty and I don\u2019t think it works as well as it did when it was new. And honestly it\u2019s lived a life it\u2019s served more than its purpose it\u2019s been great. So I found this one and it\u2019s really quite large 7.5 is more like family sized. Which is great because I have 5 kids and I use it at least 3-4 times per week. It makes a lot of cooking easy, healthy and quick. So it gets a lot of use. I\u2019ve used this one twice and it\u2019s cooked everything perfectly. I used the preheat once and the other time I just started it. Both times a couple of clicks and a few minutes later I\u2019ve had perfectly cooked food. The design is sleek and looks nice on the counter and it does fit conveniently in my cabinet next to my instant pot. There are multiple pre setting which makes it convenient for me to figure out ideal cooking times, I adjust accordingly and it\u2019s been perfect. I used a bit of tin foil on the bottom (burgers get greasy) just to try to keep the basket a bit cleaner and it was so super easy, perfect burgers 8 mins later. I absolutely LOVE the light function on this. It is BEYOND CONVENIENT when cooking you don\u2019t have to interrupt the cooking or the internal temp just to check! This is SO cool and I LOVE it!! When cleaning I just hand washed the basket part with a bit of dawn and water, and it basically wiped completely clean there was so serious effort it was so easy! I was a bit shocked to be honest at how easy it was to clean. The manual has some recipes and ideas which was exciting too! I love to find new ideas. Overall I have been really impressed and happy with this new air fryer it\u2019s certainly making my life easier and my family a bit healthier! I would recommend this.",

It might be the latter since other reviewers' photos seem to show it as well.I noticed that if you pause the cooking timer and take the food out early, it will stop the heating element (good) but it won't stop flashing the screen and will stay lit until you hit the off button. Would be nice if it automatically turned off, but tbh I feel like this is still the best air fryer you can get at this price. It's good looking, easy to use, and no the tray is not sharp to the point that it could cut you lol",
