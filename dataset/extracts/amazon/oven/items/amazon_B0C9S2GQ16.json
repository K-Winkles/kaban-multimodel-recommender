I have been hesitant to buy non-stick cookware due to the chemicals, but Nuwave has none of them. It is truly non-stick, I have not had to add oils or sprays. They work great and clean up easily. It says they are dishwasher safe, but I think they will last longer if hand washed, which is my preference. I've had stainless pots and pans for 20 years, hating how everything stuck. So happy I bought these and would recommend them to everyone.",

We selected these because of the ceramic non-stick coating and because of the fact that the pans have a stainless steel base.We are very pleased with how easy they are to clean and we\u2019ve not had any stains on an outer surface. We feel the 5 pans are a good value for the price. I like the \u201csolid\u201d weight feel of the pans. The material seems thicker than most aluminum pans plus these have a stainless steel bottom that adds weight and durability. Our stovetop is gas.",

I haven\u2019t had any issues with food sticking on it. And they look great! Now for the cons. I noticed the coating coming off on the rim, the part where the lid sits on the pot. That\u2019s kind of unfortunate. And the handles are not ergonomic. The edges are uncomfortable to hold. But it\u2019s not a deal breaker for me. All in all, these pots are great!",

I reviewed a ton of sets before settling on the Nuwave pans. I LOVE THESE PANS!!!! Nothing sticks. They are heavy, not some cheap aluminum ones that warp. Today I made chili. EVERY pot I used before, ended up with burnt beans on the bottom. Not this set! It simmered all day and when I served it, everything was perfect. Nothing burnt on the bottom. When I emptied the pot, it cleaned up like a dream. I can't say enough about them.",

Compared to our Cuisinart pots, many of which are 37 years old and still excellent, these are surprisingly nice: Thick bottom (better for even heating) and walls, a finish that seems very solid, and a tough non-stick interior. Hint: Don't believe that hype that you don't need oil or margarine and the foot will just slip out--but with a squirt of Pam, it will, easily. Glass lids are a toss-up, but we generally prefer them because you can see what's going on, yet you must treat them carefully. You must use non-metallic utensils but most people do anyway.So far, we're thrilled with them!",
