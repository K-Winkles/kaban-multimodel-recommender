Bird came out perfect when they both read 165. It\u2019s also nice to not have to guess at steak doneness anymore!",

                "reviewText": "Update to my review below: Seems as though the more I use the probes, the faster they are able to read the ambient temperature. After about five uses, they now read fairly accurately after about 1 to 2 hours. I increased my overall rating from 3 to 4 stars.Original Review: These wireless meat thermometers are very accurate (for meat only - see below), have a long lasting battery and have a great wireless range. I bought them for the range and I liked the idea of monitoring both meat and ambient temperatures at the same time fro the same probe. I have used them twice so far, once for smoking/cooking an 8lb brisket and then to smoke/cook a chuck roast to make some burnt ends - both using indirect heat and smoke trays in my natural gas BBQ. The battery was good for the entire 14 hour smoke/cook for the brisket!. The only problem is that the ceramic tip takes at least 5 or 6 hours or more to heat up before it will give a reasonably accurate ambient temperature reading, which makes this feature worthless to me. The app works great and I can get readings while I'm almost anywhere in my house. I gave it only 3 stars overall and for accuracy because of the ambient temperature issue. I like being able to charge the base unit using a USB-C connector.",

                "reviewText": "After my 3rd Meater+ went bad, I decided to give this device a shot. First, I would endorse this over the prior device for various reasons, but there is one hiccup keeping it from being a 5-star.The problem:The black probe seems to disconnect randomly. I\u2019ve made sure it is positioned where it doesn\u2019t accidentally touch grill grates, fully charged the battery, and cleaned it spotless prior to every use (carbon build up created signal problems with former devices). I\u2019ve used it separately, and on the same piece of meat and for whatever reason it tends to drop. The receiver and app just show: \u201c - - -\u201c. I can\u2019t ever seem to get it to reconnect once it does this. At least there\u2019s a second spike as a backup. The black spike seems to read lower than the white spike in all scenarios too, but there could be differences in ambient temps due to placement or internal meat temp due to thickness of the cut and so forth. I\u2019m willing to give these guys4 stars right now but not 5 because i primarily use the white spike only as a result of the weirdness with the black - which essentials it a single spike, which is what I was replacing/moving away from. I\u2019d like it if the seller would reach out to discuss solutions/replacements is necessary. Good customer service would be the difference in a 5 star upgrade, or a downgrade to 3 stars.The good (there a lot):1. Dual spikes give more accurate realtime cook info than competitor\u2019s single spike devices for the same price point.2. Spikes are MUCH more robust than previous devices3. Remote docking station is extremely better build/designed than competitor devices in that you\u2019re not tied to using an app that gives you problems mid-cook.4. Battery life is better than previous devices5. Signal range: I can go inside my house from the first floor deck and down into the basement for prolonged periods without losing signal - basement was absolutely not an option on previous devices.6. Docking station isn\u2019t \u201cwood\u201d - my dogs love to chew wood. They chewed two other previous devices up badly. Also, would is porous, so water and food stains are a thing.7. Docking station is rechargeable - previous devices used batteries, and ran through them at an absurd cadence to boot.8. Docking station is backlit - huge advantage during early morning/late evening/night cooks.9. Spike don\u2019t have a \u201ccap\u201d over the transmitter that you can wiggle off during cleaning.10. Overall design lends itself to ease of cleaning more than previous devices11. My wife can pick it up and use it easily in the kitchen without having to be shackled to an app on my phone to tell the temps.In general, I\u2019m happy with this unit and will be using it for the foreseeable future, while the black probe gets wonky sometimes- it\u2019s not every time. That part could be better (hint hint seller), but in general this is a significant upgrade from the previous device I was replacing which also randomly disconnected for various reasons, had poor battery life, shackled you to apps that acted up, and unfortunately attracted the attention of my two dogs when no one was looking.Update 2 months in the black probe has completely crapped out. It\u2019s a brick. Zero response acknowledgment from seller to the original post. No way to get help or ask questions. I just wanted a replacement black probe. The lack of response or engagement feels like commitment to customer experience or quality. Maybe I\u2019ll go back to Meater2+ since it handles temps up to 900+ now. This thing is junk. Bluetooth range has diminished to about 14 feet. Doesn\u2019t send signals through the walls anymore. Doesn\u2019t check any of the original boxes, and the black prob died right in the middle of cooking the Christmas prime rib. I gave these guys a shot and got burned. For the price, it should last longer than 60 days. Since buying and reviewing it, I\u2019ve noticed spikes very similar popping up on other \u201cme-too\u201d devices. I absolutely can\u2019t recommend this thing. \u201cBuyer beware\u201d if you choose to roll the dice on it.Update again mid-cook. Black probe started working but is giving bizarre readings. Analog thermometer that\u2019s always reasonably accurate says 300, white probe says 282, black probe says 143. Oddly the IT on the black is higher than the white by 30 degrees too. Can\u2019t trust that kinda output.",

I cooked a whole turkey on the smoker on Christmas using these wireless probes. It was about 5hrs cook time and these probes were accurate and stayed charged the entire time.",
