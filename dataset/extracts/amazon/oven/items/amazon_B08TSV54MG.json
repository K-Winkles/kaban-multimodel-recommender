                "reviewText": "Wasn't sure I really needed one of these, but after being convinced by a friend with this same brand/style but larger size unit, decided to give it a try. While it may look smaller than an oven, it definitely holds a lot inside, and I have yet to ever fill my actual oven, so this makes a lot more sense. Heats up quickly and does exactly what it says it'll do on multiple settings... I am very impressed - and I'm not even a fan of cooking anything... this totally eliminates the oven for 99% of anything I would usually bake in an oven, and it's so much easier to use, quicker and no hot spots in weird places, like I have in the back of my oven. This replaces a much older basic toaster oven that did it's job for what it could do, but now I have so many other options to work with, I've even started making new things I would have never tried before... Love it!",

It's my 5th air fryer, and none seem to air fry as good as the one you could buy in the 90s, but it works (occasionally you might add 3-4 minutes for more crispness.One, and only one complaint. They give you 4 accessories (Crumb Tray, Rack, Basket, Baking Tray). The Tray is the issue. Works fine but the stuff you put on it stains from first use (I made a roll of cinnamon rolls from a tube). It doesn't look non-stick, it's doesn't say it's non stick, it gives no special handling instructions, but after one use, it looks like the Tray is 15 years old. Don't let this stop you, but If I had to do it again, I'd cook anything on a layer of aluminum foil",

                "reviewText": "To my surprise, it is smaller than I thought it was, and I can fit it in the place where my old toaster oven went. I didn't realize just how much I needed the constant circulating air to evenly cook my food. I can't wait to try all the features this has, but primarily I bought this to heat up my cook unity meals. I had basically beef stew for lunch and it was almost perfect. Quite the change from the burned or freezing cold meals I've been eating lately with that inherited toaster oven. I just need to figure out how to adjust the time to the ideal for my meals but I'm confident I can. Also really excited about having pizza again! There is a very small gap between the two doors, but I'm not terribly concerned about that. I checked several times while it was cooking seeing how hot that area was and it wasn't that hot at all. It was about the same temperature as the glass",

                "reviewText": "I liked the compact nature of this 20L Air fryer, and it was well made, but after using it a few times, i just felt it struggled to do it's job, if you used the drip tray it killed the circulation, so you would have to turn the items constantly to get them to cook evenly, i think the biggest design flaw with this unit is that they use a small fan, likely a 120mm fan, that shoots air from the side, which means that it won't circulate air nearly as well as a top firing fan, the fan is also not very powerful, it's actually very quiet, which is nice, but if it's not moving enough air, then what's the point, the faster the air moves in an air fryer the better. This unit is more like a XL toaster oven with a convection feature, the fan needs to move MUCH, MUCH more air than that to be classified as an air fryer. This was not the experience i was looking for.",
