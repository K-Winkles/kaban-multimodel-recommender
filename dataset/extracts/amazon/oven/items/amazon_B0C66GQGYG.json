Does a great job toasting the bread. Even heat distribution. I love the digital read out and timer so I can see when it will be done. Only complaint would be that both sides go down so not like normal 4 slice toaster where you just do one side. But it is much more efficient on toasting. Warming option is great too.",

                "reviewText": "The toaster has a nice look, the digital time remaining readout is nice. I needed a toaster that I could place horizontally on the counter, so having the controls on the side instead of the end was very helpful. I have to subtract a star because the toaster does not toast the bread evenly on both sides. It isn't enough of a difference to warrant returning the item. It is about one level different (i.e., one side will look like the darkness level set and the other side will be 1 level lighter). The defrost setting works when taking a new loaf out of the freezer and immediately putting a slice in the toaster. I haven't tested the bagel setting. The long slots work well for slices of sour dough rounds and rye breads that have wider slices. For the price, it serves its purpose.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great quality toaster. I wanted to use it for a while before I did a review. It is longer and wider than I expected but I have now learned to love that about it and love all the features. I also love that if you have large specialty size bread slices that they can fit with no issues. The slots are very long and wide with no divider in each slot. Bagels fit with no issues. You can put 4 bagels halves or 4 regular pieces of toast in at one time or just 2 at a time. The timer on the side helps also with my impatience as I know what to expect since it shows how much time is left. It does not put out any heat on the sides but does put out quite a bit from the top. Not enough to be concerned unless I had something in there a long time. I do have it on my counter which sits under my upper cabinet next to my microwave and if I were to need something to be in there longer I would just pull it away from my upper cabinet so it would not be directly below it. The cord is a good length. I have not used the metal holders for anything yet to reheat or keep it warm so I cannot say how it works but I am sure it would work great with the heat it puts out. I do have a smaller kitchen and storage space is limited so I can't put it away anywhere plus I don't like getting crumbs in my cabinets. So, I leave it on the counter. It does take up quite a bit of space but I use it a lot, so it works out for me. The 2 main reasons I got it was the timer and the size of the slots so I can deal with the size of the whole toaster because I love the size of the slots. It also had good reviews.",

                "reviewText": "This toaster has two large slots that can accomodate slices of homemade bread. The digital controls are a bit difficult to understand at first but after a few uses it's okay.It seems to toast the bread unevenly though. One side of the bread will always be cooked more than the other.When I make toast I move the toaster out so it is not directly under the cabinets. That much heat is not good for the cabinet above the toaster. The tray that holds the crumbs does not work very well. I have to clean the counter surface under the toaster to pickup all the crumbs that fall out the bottom.",

Whatever the reason, I will return for money back rather than a replacement because I do not have faith in the fact it didn't turn on at all, and I don't want the inconvenience of having to re-package and drive to a UPS store to return another.",

Why is it available here, when it won't function here. It nearly blew up when I plugged it in!",

Some of the heating element wires don\u2019t seem to get hot or at least hot enough to be red in colour. The countdown clock is kinda hokey! I don\u2019t think I\u2019d buy this toaster again given its performance!",
