                "reviewText": "As hokey as this thing appeared to be, I've used it almost every day since buying it. The first time I used my counter-top air fryer, I got a nasty burn, where the scar still persists, so I was anxious to find something that would help me out without making it harder to grab things. I use this thing all the time now. I like the different angled hooks, so you can push or pull the oven rack easily. The tool doesn't bend, so you can use it to hold the rack up even with weight on it. I've had other varieties that have metal hooks on them, but the one I had got stuck on the oven rack for me in the past, making me have to wriggle a bit to get it off. This hooks well because of the shape of the head, but it also allows for easier releases because of the open design and slicker material. The material also makes it easier to clean than those metal ones - it wipes clean very easily, mostly because it doesn't melt, so the surface stays smooth. The color makes it easy to find in my utensil drawer. Since it's mostly flat, it stores very easily as well. Great idea!And my younger son is just starting to cook for himself, so he was happy to have something that would keep him safer.",

I bought multiple as stocking stuffers because they\u2019re something you don\u2019t always know you need until you absolutely need it. This one is sturdy and has a little weight to it so it just feels like a necessity when pulling out those shelves and pans. Pretty happy with them. Also they make me smile.",
