        "description": "Product Description The fast and easy way to bake frozen, homemade, take-and-bake, and deli pizza. Also great for preparing frozen convenience foods such as chicken nuggets, jalape\u2013o poppers, fish fillets, egg rolls, cinnamon rolls, cookies and much more. Rotating tray turns continuously to assure even baking. Top and bottom heating elements bake foods from both sides. Heating elements are separately controlled, allowing you to select top, bottom, or both elements for perfect results every time. Timer signals end of cooking time and automatically turns off heating elements. Save as much as 60% in energy compared to a conventional oven. Nonstick pan is removable for easy cleanup and storage. 120 volts AC, 6o Hz only, 1235 watts Amazon.com This 1,235-watt countertop oven makes pizza in about half the time required by a conventional oven. You don't need to preheat it--it begins rotating and baking the moment you plug it in. There are independently controlled top and bottom heating elements, so all types (frozen or fresh) and sizes (7 to 12 inches) of pizza can be custom baked. With a rising-crust pizza, for example, you should run the lower heating element for 10-12 minutes before turning on the top element. For a crisper crust, bake the pizza with both heating elements, then finish it off with a few minutes of bottom-only heating. For extra cooking time on your toppings, leave the top element on a little longer. A timer with automatic shutoff lets you set cooking times precisely, and a cooking-time guide for various pizza types is printed on the pizza maker. For safety, the appliance shuts off automatically if it overheats. With the 13-1/4-inch-diameter baking pan in place, the pizza maker is 13-1/4 inches wide, 9-1/2 inches high, and 17-1/2 inches deep. (The baking pan can be removed for more compact storage.) It carries a two-year warranty against defects. --Fred Brack",

Then I decided to try and bake refrigerated cookie dough. Again perfection. The versatility is no doubta great feature of this machine! Directions are easy. So easy to clean. I am sure I will be experimenting a lot. Will do pizza tomorrow and fish fillets on Friday. Only drawback is storing it. Yes the baking plate comes off, but the unit itself is a good size. Also, I would think that the heating elements on top and bottom, which are somewhat exposed, need to be very carefully taken care of...in other words, you cant just shove it into your cupboard. I have already made a nice roomy spot fot so it eont be disturbed. Well worth the juggling that I had to do to accomplish that! I highly recommend, so far. Just the first day for me. But so far each thing I have tried has come out better than I expected. It's really interesting watching the change in food as it cooks too. Very fast shipping. Packed very nicely.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely Fantastic Product",
                "reviewText": "I initially ordered one of these for a relative who entertains a lot, and thought it would come in handy for them. I then later thought about it, and realized this *might* be handy for me/my family too. So...of course, I had to order one.I really had minimal expectations for this product. I knew it obviously cooked pizzas and possibly other little frozen items. I had no idea that I would literally use it all the time. Every day.I have 2 kids who love pizza and enjoy snacks like mozzarella sticks, fish sticks, and other frozen food items that you might typically throw in an oven when you are crunched for time. These are obvious items that can be used easily on this product, and it certainly delivers. It is incredibly simple to use. You plug it in, throw whatever you want to cook on it, and set the timer. You don't waste time preheating. There is no heat adjustment, but it cooks it perfectly. It rotates while cooking, and my kids get a kick out of watching it cook right in front of them. It cooks pizza (even the cheapie junk ones) into perfection. I have made countless homemade pizzas and it makes them perfect every time. Reheating your pizza on it refreshes it to its former glory. Once the timer is done, it stops heating the product (but simply keeps rotating), so you don't burn your food if you get distracted for a minute or 2.What I was not counting on is all the other items we would end up cooking on it. I enjoy making homemade cookies and cinnamon rolls from scratch with my kids, and (so long as they are not large or rise too tall) we are able to cook those with ease, too. I am a vegetarian (mostly vegan), and I can cook my veggie patties and other veggie products on it, and they don't come out soggy like they do sometimes in a microwave. You can add things to your food while it is cooking, and you can see for yourself whether it is done or not (or burnt). Leftovers from a restaurant reheat perfectly on it, too. No more nuking food with a microwave.The cons to this product: You have to watch to make sure you aren't cooking something too tall or close to the heating element (think dough that rises up too high, etc). When I make cookies, biscuits, cinnamon rolls, or anything doughy on it, I make them small or squash them down a little so they don't rise too high.Another con is that if you have a super large pizza, this won't accommodate it. The circular pan thingy it cooks on will cook a standard large pizza (like standard frozen pizza size), but no larger. That said, the product would probably take up too much space if it were any bigger, which leads me to my next con...yes, it is a little bulky if you do not have space for it.While you can certainly burn yourself on it, as with anything, you have to use a little common sense and keep it out of reach from little hands. That said, it is not as drastic of heat and the risk of harming yourself should you touch it is MUCH less than if you were messing with an oven. I have used this product every day (unless we are out of town) for about 15 months straight, and with minimal care, I can't recall a time that I burned myself, and I rarely have to wear oven mitts since I can just grab a spatula and get it off easily onto a plate straight from the pan. My kids have never burned themselves on it either. I always supervise them if they want to add something on whatever we are cooking (which they love to participate in), and they know to be careful. I always worry with an oven, but with a little caution, I really don't worry much with this item. I can touch my finger quickly on the pan while it is rotating and not hurt myself (as long as I pull my finger off right away). Could I do that with an oven and not hurt myself? Uh, no.Cleaning it is a breeze, too. Overall, we love it so much that our microwave hardly ever gets used and our oven is reserved for larger items, like casseroles and other larger home-cooked items.I would recommend this for anyone and everyone, and not just for the pizza lover. It is not expensive, and I would imagine this would be a great gift for the average college student.",

Cooked homemade pizza topped with lots of heavy toppings and meats just as well as my pizza shown in the video with a few select toppings. Plug it in, turn the dial and watch it transform your pizza while tidying up the kitchen. I bought this appliance for my daughter first. She says it cooks frozen pizzas much better than the oven or microwave. It's so easy to clean. The rotating tray comes off and hand washes in seconds like a dream. I love this appliance. It's a brilliant design. I have full confidence that it can do all the things they say it can and do them well. I wish I had known about this appliance sooner!",

                "reviewText": "Read through a lot of reviews before purchasing. Was going back-and-forth between this one and some more expensive ones I noticed this one had quite a lot of reviews which were helpful in making my decision. Very easy to use right out of the box, was able to clean it off and prepare my first pizza. First pizza turned out great took less than 20 minutes. Only thing that caught me off guard is that it turns on the minute you plug it in I was looking around for the off switch. Unless it\u2019s on there somewhere and I\u2019m missing it. The first picture was the before and second picture was after it finished. Definitely recommend great value.",

                "reviewText": "People in my household were always heating the oven to 450 to cook a small pizza, now they can start cooking with no pre-heating and be done in 20 minutes. This machine makes a pefect pizza every time, it heats from the top and bottom, and even has a fan which acts like a convection oven. The convenience, ease of cleanup (basically just wipe the non-stick surface), small size, and extremely effective cooking makes this an amazing unit -- I cannot recommend it enough (not to mention the power being saved by not having to heat up a full sized oven).",

I use this more than my oven, and I cook everything from wings, to chicken fingers, pizza (duh), fries, onion rings. It is one of the best kitchen appliances I have ever bought. No preheating, no issues. My only recommendation is to keep the pan really clean, and when it gets stuff built up (it will eventually) just use parchment paper on it to keep it cleaner.",
