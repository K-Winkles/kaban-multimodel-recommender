                "reviewText": "I have a mid-century house and have decorated my kitchen accordingly so a digital display oven/air fryer would have just ruined the look. I almost couldn't believe my eyes when I found this mechanical control GE unit.Another big problem that ruins so many modern appliances is wildly oversized, ugly logos, I'm thrilled with a tastefully sized classic GE \"meatball\" logo that enhances rather than detracts from the design. This unit looks perfect on top of vintage serving cart.Besides being beautiful and fitting into my decor, the oven works great too, temperatures are accurate and the timer is accurate. The mechanical option also comes into play with making the appliance blissfully easy to use too, just three knobs to set, the function (bake, toast, air fry, etc.), the desired temperature, and the time. No tedious menus to fumble through or learning curve whatsoever! And unlike many ovens like this, the toast function actually toasts things as fast as a toaster.I love this oven!UPDATE - A frequent complaint of air-fryers is the noise, but air fry function on this oven barely makes any noise. You do hear the whir of the fan when it's on, but it's low enough that you can easily carry on a conversation in normal tones, listen to music or TV. For comparison, my old B&D convection toaster oven was much noisier when baking than the GE is when air-frying! Impressive. When using other features you barely hear anything, just the gentle, barely audible ticking of the manual timer (which I like). GE really though of everything when designing this oven, it's a pleasure all around to use.",

                "reviewText": "and an update: did hear from GE but in the meantime I found an ever so easy fix and am happily baking, roasting, air frying, and toasting and warming.a replacement knob: ordered from Amazon: TJPoto Replacement Part Timer knob Air Fryer HF-919B D Type Shaft; within 2 minutes of its arrival my GE oven was operational without the handy pliers to set the timer.Oven is a delight to use and easy to clean. Price is reasonable. If the timer knob is your concern, there are universal replacement knobs out there evnn more inexpensive than the one I purchased.Loved this appliance for 3 months, when the timer knob came off and could not be reattached. The on and off function is controlled by the timer knob: if it does not work, the oven does not work. Even more distressing is that that GE did not respond to any email requests for assistance despite there being a warranty. I have ordered a universal toaster oven knob \"d\" style (as it is on this GE oven) and am guardedly hopeful.Nonetheless-- not even a \"thank you for your email and we will be in touch soon\" from GE. Very disappointing.",

                "reviewText": "G E Digital Control toaster oven - So this was my first toaster oven purchase. The oven itself is good but after shopping around more there are better ovens for the same price range or a little more. This oven doesn\u2019t have an interior light even though the picture looks like it does unless I missed it. I had to keep opening the door to check the food. The pans are not that sturdy and are small. I think the biggest draw back for me was not being able to add more time .. for example when I toasted frozen waffles and they weren\u2019t completely done I had to wait for the oven to finish and cool then restart cooking. Another thing to consider if you are thinking of purchasing this oven is that if you need to return it you can only return it using UPS and there is a significant turnaround time for your refund back to your credit card. I started my return on December 26, 2023 they acknowledged that they received the oven December 29, 2023 but the credit will not be initiated to my card until between January 12th - January 21, 2024. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s takes that long to initiate the refund. Once the refund has been initiated there is another delay before the funds hit my card so I\u2019m not at all happy about that.",

You can always put parchment paper to catch drips but it\u2019s not even worth the time because it cleans so easily. I brought it over to my mamas house during thanksgiving so we would have another oven available and it cooked better than her real oven.Only issue I\u2019ve had with it is the timer knob fell off but I just put some super glue on it and haven\u2019t had a problem with it since. My real oven\u2019s knob has also fallen off and been replaced so maybe it\u2019s user error...",

I use it all the time for baking, and it works fine, although the temperature can be difficult to regulate. The convection function works well. It toasts fine but takes a long time. Haven't had good luck with Air fry. We prefer mechanical to digital, which is why be chose this one. We wouldn't order it again. Another brand with metal knobs might be better.",
