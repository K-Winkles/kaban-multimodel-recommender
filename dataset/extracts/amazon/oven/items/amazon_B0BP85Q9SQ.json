I was looking at microwaves, but they're all insanely priced nowadays. I saw toaster ovens seemed to be way cheaper and found this one. I like the idea that I'm reheating something and not microwaving it too. The quality of food is better tasting in my opinion. It's been great for toast, reheating leftovers, and much more. A little tray is included, and a tip to keep your tray clean is to cover it with aluminum foil. You can change it out when it gets a little icky and your tray is still in perfect condition!",

It says it fits for pieces of toast, yeah cause there's no room for anything else you can just barely fit that. If u are a 1 person house go for it but if you have this as a 2ed over don't waste your time.",

                "reviewText": "This toaster oven is utter garbage The pictures are misleading. This reminds me of Swiss Colony's creative photography. The material it's made of is most certainly not steel. It's more like tin. As far as capacity. There is no way this gadget will hold what it's advertised to hold. You'd be lucky to squeeze a single chicken leg in it. Absolute garbage. Overpriced as well. The delivery was delayed as well. There are much better options on the market. I suggest you explore and compare. My first thought was to throw the piece of junk in the garbage dumpster when I first opened it. If I didn't pay such an outrageous price for it I most certainly would have. But the piece of is being returned. Hopefully I'll get a refund.",
