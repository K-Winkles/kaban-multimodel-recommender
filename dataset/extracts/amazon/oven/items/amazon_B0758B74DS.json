                "reviewText": "Update: I changed the rating from 4 stars to 5. After about two months the main complaint of toast not being brown on the bottom has changed. I'm not sure why, but the toast is now evenly brown all over an dit browns quicker than before. ??? Maybe the elements needed to \"burn in\"? Whatever the problem was, it seems to be resolved now. Hooray!Our toaster bit the dust and we haven't had a toaster oven in years so we thought it was a clever idea to combine both and it is with one drawback (the bottom 1/2\" -1\" so of the toast doesn't brown due to the placement of the elements. It's not a dealbreaker for me because what it does brown is nice and even. The whole slice feels toasted, it's just not all brown. (see update above) You need to hold the toaster lever down for a couple seconds for it to catch and start toasting. You can't just push it down and release. I like that there is a cancel button and you can lift the toast slightly to help in removing it. It's handy that you can toast different shapes of bread in the wide slot. I like the overall size of this oven. It doesn't take up a lot of space in the kitchen. Not much more than the large 4 slice toaster we had. The controls are easy to use and not complicated like some. You do have to turn on the timer to get the oven to work. It has a pleasant timer alert, a must for my husband. Note, the alert only works with the oven, not the toaster. I like that the toaster part closes when not in use by pushing a lever. The oven heats up quickly. We've used the broiler a lot and it works great. I like that you can prop the door partly open to allow heat to dissipate after use. I bought a set of pans made for toaster ovens and am glad I did. It makes it much more versatile.My only real issue is that the whole thing gets quite hot. We didn't put it under a low overhanging cabinet for that reason. You don't want to touch the edges of door (the handle is fine) or outside parts of the oven when taking food out. I got several small burns when I used it the first couple times. I'm more aware now.Overall it's a great little toaster/oven and we're happy with our choice.",

                "reviewText": "Toaster function is flawless, perfect on both sides, even color and through cooked. Ignore people saying it is hard to use. You have to hold the lever down for 1 second until red light comes on. Perfect toast on 2 and half setting. Waffles on 3. 5 is max.There is a reason for this in case you got you toast in there wonky or it slipped sideways and want to fix it real quick, just release. Slot is wide for bagels so some little skinny tiny piece of pumpkin toast might need adjusting. Think you are done and want to eject early? Hit red light button. Done.Corn dogs are notoriously difficult with my older toasters. I put two in the microwave for 50sec to defrost. Use rack on bottom setting. 8 min at 350. They come out perfect all the way around without constantly rotating them. Heated all way through. Kids love it.Fully eliminated two appliances for one and it looks nice too. The lack of digital controls is good. Knobs and buttons, less to break, simple for kids to use also.Ambient heat is no different than any other toaster I have had. The toast may sit low in the slot if your bread is small so yes use common sense when plucking it out. Even my kids understand that one.Highly recommend .",

It\u2019s easy to clean and looks really nice on my counter. I highly recommend this item.",

The oven works well, just remember to switch it from toaster to oven otherwise it will not work. I do wish it cooked the food quicker. We had another mini oven that cooked the food much faster but we liked the 2 in one option of this one. It is a little bigger than our previous countertop oven but doesn't affect us much. We have been using it for about 3 weeks and no complaints yet. Just keep in mind that the tray will make a popping sound and bend a bit after the first use.",

Appreciate this one is a little bigger, allowing for more or slightly larger items. Nothing beats the toaster option, since it's used frequently, plus it toasts more evenly, since bread sits deeper into unit.I zap many items for very short time in microwave then finish off toasting in this little oven--speeding up preparation for a just out of the oven look and taste. Honestly, for our family this is a wonderful combination of traditional toaster and small baking oven.",
