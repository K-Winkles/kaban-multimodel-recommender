                "reviewText": "This particular broiler comes with coil heating element which is 100 times better than the halogen bulb heating. I tried the halogen one and the fan was loud and the whole thing was just too bright. It cooked really well for the 7 months it lasted. One day it the halogen just popped and kind of shorted out. The previous one I had was coil and lasted me over 11 years with pretty much daily use. The only reason it broke was I dropped the lid in the dink as i was cleaning and the fan came off loose. The coil still worked but it was a gonner.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this convection oven to replace my last one that served faithfully for 5 or 6 years.So far I'm pleased, the only complaints are small. The power cord occasionally comes loose from the motor. And the circulating fan is less powerful than previous unit which is good and bad. It does move the air during cooking, and it runs very quiet compared to last. The down side is, where after cooking, I would turn the heat element off, and use the fan to cool off the food to eating temperature. This fan speed isn't as effective for that task. I do wish the metal extender ring was more solid. Treat it gingerly, because if you bend it, it won't sit properly, and could lead to the weight of the lid collapsing possibly causing damage or glass breakage.",

The glass bowl cracks and chips easily. My first unit had small cracks and chips. The bowl for my second unit has cracked in half after less than 3 months. The crack happened while the oven was in use, and not from dropping/hitting something. It's always on the counter, so the bowl was sitting at room temperature before it was used.",
