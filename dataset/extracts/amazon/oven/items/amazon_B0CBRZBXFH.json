Keep the liner away from the oven's heating element. If the oven's heating element is at the bottom, avoid placing the liner on it. Instead, put it on a lower shelf at least one inch away from the heating element to prevent damage caused by higher temperatures near the heater than the set temperature in the oven.",

My GE is not (thank goodness because I had convection in my beach house and hated it). It fit perfect and I have used the oven a dozen times and no issues. Looks like it wipes easily but you can also pull out and handwash. I feel like its a good buy. You get two mats with this one and its nice to have a back up just in case. :) Happy shopping.",

                "reviewText": "I had to buy a new gas stove (and I just dare the appliance police to try and take it to gas stove jail). My old stove is 30 years old, and better than gas stove on the market now, the control panel died. My old stove has a removable oven bottom, I only had to take it outside and clean it like new. Easy!The new stove doesn't have that removal feature. I see myself on my knees, half way inside the oven to clean it. Poo! With that vision in my head, I decided that I need these oven liners. I bought the gold ones because I want more light in the oven. I was dubious about their durability when I took them out of the box, they are so thin. Since there are two, I cut one to fit inside my toaster oven. After I cut it to size, I throughly washed, rinsed and dried it. I don't want factory stuff smoking or smelling up my kitchen. Then I tested it. I set the toaster oven to 400\u00b0 and let it heat for 15 minutes with no food or pans inside. Following the instructions for an electric oven, I put the liner on the crumb tray, below the heating elements. There's only about 3\" between the heat element and the liner, so the liner is very close to the heat. I expected the liner to melt or catch fire. Didn't happen! Wahoo! Pot pies at 400\u00b0, pizza at 425\u00b0, dinner rolls (covered) on the 'keep warm' for 30 minutes ... all good! No problems with the liner. It's great that I don't have to keep replacing the protective foil. I can wash the liner and put it back in the toaster oven, no more replacing and wasting foil. I like how much quicker the liner is to clean and no wasting foil is great.The liner directives are different liner placement for electronic ovens and gas ovens. I can only review regarding my gas oven. The liner directive instructs gas oven placement should be on the lower of the two racks. I cut the liner to fit only over the solid floor of the oven, leaving the open flame vents clear, the flames would probably set the liner on fire. Later, before I used the oven for the first time, I read the full stove manual. According to the manual, the warranty is voided if a liner is used in the oven. I won't be using the liner in the gas oven.I've already cut this liner, but I can still use it in the toaster oven.The top gas burners have large, grill like grates, they are heavy and a pain to clean. I can put them in the dishwasher and that's fine, but here's the thing about the grates. When using the griddle in the middle, any food splatters grease on the unused grates. Sometimes, the splattered grease isn't a lot, but the grates still have to be cleaned to eliminate grease smells and buildup. I put foil over the grates, manual says, don't do that and explains about carbon monoxide build up. Okay, covering them tightly, I understand. I just gently laid the foil on to catch the grease. That's a lot of foil and I don't want to save it for multiple uses because it stinks of grease. I'm going to buy the longer length of this liner and cut it to lay on top of the grates. I hope that will work fine because they can tolerate indirect heat from the griddle and flame. I can easily wash the liner and not waste a lot of foil. I'm not suggesting that anyone do the same. I haven't tried it yet, so I don't know if my idea will be a safe thing to do. I like the liner and if I can use it to reduce cleanup, that's the point. If it doesn't work out, I'll have a lifetime supply of toaster oven liners. I will also use it as a mat for hot pans on my countertop.In case you missed it, there are two liners in the box. I'm guessing you'll eventually need to replace the liner, that's why there's two of them. I don't know how long the liners last, but two of them for the price is a good buy compared to other liner options. Since I've never used liners before, I'm on a learning curve.",

                "reviewText": "You know how sometimes when you cook something like a pizza in the oven you\u2019re supposed to put it right on the rack? What do you do if the stuff falls through the rack? Then it will get stuck on the bottom of your oven, which is such a pain to clean. I got tired of that happening so I decided to get these because I can cut them to the right size of my oven and if anything falls to the bottom these will catch it. Then I can just wait until the oven has cooled off, take these out and wash them off and use them again. It\u2019s so, so much easier than having to get into the oven to clean it and because they\u2019re non stick it\u2019s super quick and easy. I like that they\u2019re free of chemicals so I don\u2019t have to worry about anything getting into my food when I cook and they withstand temperatures up to 500 degrees so I don\u2019t have to worry about them burning. I also like that you can use them in other things aside from your oven, like your air fryer for example. That will make cleaning my air fryer so much easier, too. Oh, you can also use them on cookie sheets instead of foil, so that\u2019s cool too.",
