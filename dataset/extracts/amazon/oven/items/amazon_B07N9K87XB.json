                "reviewText": "I was looking for a small toaster oven that could be used with my solar battery, and had my eye on this one for quite some time. I knew when I ordered it that it was not the end-all-to-end-all of toaster ovens, but it does do a surprisingly good job for its size. We have been using it every day since we received it and are very happy with it. My DH loves hot dogs and has been cooking them in this. The microwave causes the hotdogs to explode, but this little oven cooks them perfectly. Also, the night before I had cooked hamburger patties of which zi had two left over. I wrapped them in foil and put them in this cute oven, wound the timer to its full extent. The burgers came out steaming hot, and much better than nuking them in the microwave. Of course, it toasts bread beautifully -- even large slices of homemade bread, toaster pastries, anything that is fairly flat. This cute little guy gets up to 400 degrees, and only 400 degrees -- nothing more and nothing less. It is important to keep food at a distance from the upper burner to keep the food from burning. I have several Dash appliances and this little toaster oven is like them in that it cooks better with thawed food as opposed to frozen. There are all kinds of ideas on how to use (and not use) this very cute little oven. I can recommend Counter Cooking on YouTube. Who does \"cute\" appliances better than Dash? Also, not only are they cute, but they work! My next experiment for this toaster oven is thawed, flat chicken patties. One more recommendation would be to cover the enclosed baking pan with foil.",

                "reviewText": "This is the most dreadful and dangerous product. I got it because it was small and cute and I needed a toaster and a toaster oven seemed like a bonus for open-face toasted cheese toast. Do NOT let children or even teens use this even with supervision. I am a 62 year old sensible woman and I burned myself twice with this. Once because I underestimated the thickness of the cloth needed to remove the tray after toasting, and then because I inadvertently brushed against the rack while it was still hot. This unit stays hot a long time. It smokes even when everything is clean so I have to use the stove ventilation hood every time and crack the kitchen window. The first time I used it (after following directions for prior to first use) I burnt the crap out of a piece of toast while it was on setting 3. I can only set it on setting 2 for toasting and even then I have to watch it. (Why does it have higher settings?) I don't even want to donate it to Salvation Army or Goodwill for fear someone will be burned in a similar way. This product should not be on the market.",

It works great, it was inexpensive and it\u2019s very cute.**Update**I\u2019ve had this toaster a few months and I love hate it. It\u2019s cute and it toasts but you can only do one piece of toast at a time so if you have someone over it\u2019s takes forever just to make toast. Another issue is the whole toaster gets insanely hot, you need to supervise it while in use and unplug it when you are done. I don\u2019t use it enough for it to drive me crazy but if you want to toast a lot and more than one piece get something else.",
