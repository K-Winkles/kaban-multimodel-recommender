                "reviewText": "I just made breakfast and I'm in love with this Air Fryer / Toaster Oven!So, our 20+ year old toaster just died and I was looking for a replacement 4-slice toaster when I came across this dandy little unit, and I'm really glad I did. At $90 ($81 with coupon), the price is a little higher than most toasters, but it does so much more.I unboxed it and was immediately impressed with both the packaging and my initial quality assessment. the materials and workmanship seem very high compared with other small appliances in this price range. The instructions, and the unit's controls themselves, are simple and easily understood. Very short learning curve, which I appreciate.After the recommended washing of the crumb tray, drip pan, air fryer basket, grill grate, and the oven's interior, I found a place on my countertop (not as hard as I thought since the footprint is pretty compact) and got cooking.First, a package of Johnsonville breakfast sausage went onto the grate, which I set on the drip pan and slid into the lower of the oven's two grooves, based on the instructions. I set the oven to \"Air Fryer\" and set the timer for about 18 minutes. In just 10 minutes, the sausages were not only done, but cooked evenly and perfectly, and just as brown as I like them. I was interior of the oven wasn't as greasy or dirty as I expectedI followed this up by removing the sausages on the drip pan and setting them aside to cool. I set a split bagel on the Air Fryer basket and slid it into the upper of the two grooves of the oven. I set the oven to \"Toaster\" and the timer about halfway between \"Med\" and \"Dark\" and returned to my sausage for plating. When I came back a couple of minutes later, my bagel was perfectly brown and ready for me to butter and enjoy.In conclusion, this unit not only replaces my dead toaster very nicely (i can toast MORE than 4 slices at a time!) but also give me a versatile air fryer and convection oven for cooking many other dishes conveniently and quickly. I think we are really going to enjoy owning and using this.In short, I am really happy I stumbled across this oven BEFORE I bought a new toaster. It's exactly what i needed, even though I didn't know it. I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I cook a lot and so I often have one or two things in my oven, something in my convection oven, something in the air fryer, and something in the toaster oven. I use toaster ovens a lot is what I am saying. This one has a lot of great features and one bad one:PROS:+ Well made and solid+ Spacious without having a huge footprint.+ Easily holds six regular slices of toast or 3 (bakery sized) (sliced open) bagels or a small frozen pizza. More could fit if you crammed items.+ It can be turned up on it's side to make more room, though I don't do this.+ Bakes, broils, air fries, and toasts.+ Has a crumb catcher on the bottom which is easy to remove and clean.+ Has a toasting grate and a baking pan, which are interchangeable (or you can use both).+ Has 2 shelves (love this)CON:- I really really hate the control knobs. (See my 3rd pic) This may be just my own quirk so don't let this dissuade you from an otherwise well made appliance. They are hard to see and hard to read for me (I am 61 years old); I have to stoop down and squint to read them. And also they are (to me) non intuitive. There is no button for baking for example- you set the temp on top and turn it on by turning the bottom knob past toast setting to time settings. For toast there IS a toast button on top, and you turn it on below by choosing a toast setting. There are broil and air fry buttons on top which you activate below by spinning past the toast settings to the timer. It drives me batty. There should be 3 knobs and they should be easier to read.BOTTOM LINE: This unit is spacious, versatile, and well made. I personally dislike the control knobs.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This oven has three functions. It can broil, air fry, and toast. It has four attachments included that are necessary to cook with this oven. It comes with an air fry basket, wire rack, food tray for catching grease and other liquids that could drip off of food, and a crumb tray for catching crumbs. That's it. The best part is that all four of these trays can be stored inside the actual oven. So you don't need to find extra storage just to put the trays away. This oven is very straightforward. So are the directions, and the knobs on the front of the oven. I also like the style of this oven. I like how short it is in proportion to how wide it is. It makes it look somewhat cute, as far as kitchen appliances go anyway.",
