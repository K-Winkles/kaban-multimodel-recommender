                "reviewText": "I have an Anova oven and finally the dreaded descale light came on. I googled how to descale the Anova oven which stated to use a descaling liquid cleaner. This should be easy to find, right?? So, I did a search on Amazon to find a descaling cleaner many of which were for coffee makers. I found a couple for steam ovens and chose this cleaner because of the good reviews and also because it is recommended for Wolff Steam ovens.I ordered this descaling cleaner and received the next day. Descaling the Anova oven couldn't be easier. 1) Empty the water reservoir. 2) Mix 3/4 cup of this cleaner to 1 quart of distilled water and put the solution into the reservoir. 3) Put the flat tray into the bottom of the oven, close the oven, and press the descale button. 4) After 30-35 minutes, the first phase of descaling is done. 5) Empty water from the tray and dry the bottom of the oven. 6) Empty any solution left in the reservoir, rinse it, and add 1 quart of distilled water. 7) Press the start button to continue to the 2nd phase of descaling which takes about 10 minutes. 8) When this phase is done, empty water from the bottom tray and dry it. 9) Dry the bottom and sides of the oven and leave it open for a few minutes to completely dry.10) Done!!I hope this review was helpful for you.",
