                "reviewText": "I love this toaster oven! After more than 5 years of searching for a good quality toaster oven both in stores and online, and being continually disappointed by how tinny and cheaply made most of them seemed to be even at 3 times the cost of this Toshiba, I'd spotted this one on Amazon and decided in desperation to take a chance on it due to the many good reviews it already had. I've not regretted that impulse for as much as a moment, and have thoroughly enjoyed using this toaster oven.It looks great on my counter, is more sturdy than any toaster ovens I had looked at in stores for MANY years, and works great! Since I already had both a built-in Wolf convection wall oven and a built-in Wolf convection microwave oven, I hadn't cared whether the toaster oven had a convection feature or not, but am now glad it did, because I use that feature a great deal more often than I'd ever thought I would. As with most toaster ovens, the exterior of this one does get hot, but not frightenly so. I'd purchased a black silicone 9x12\" mat from Amazon to place on the top of it to diffuse some of the heat from rising to the cabinets above, but mainly so I could place a couple of extra toaster oven pans on it when the oven was in use--when not in use, I store the clean nested pans in the toaster oven. (Amazon has some great options available for extra stainless steel toaster oven pans, and a 12x10x1\" is a bit larger than the standard pans for this size toaster oven, but fits it perfectly.) I'd read one review by someone who'd returned their oven because the display sometimes fogged a little with steam when the convection feature was used. It does do that slightly, but the display remains clear enough to see even when it does, it also clears up again as soon as the oven cools, and has not negatively affected the operation of the oven whatsoever in the 2 years that I've been using mine. I truly love this toaster oven!This Toshiba actually surpasses the former great toaster oven it had taken me years to find this replacement for, since the design of it, especially the sturdy base of it, is far superior to the old one I'd had for more than 20 years. That one had been a quality toaster oven also, and had still been working like a champ, but it's one design flaw had been that one of the legs on it had broken, and I'd grown tired of crazy gluing it back on every few months or so, yet couldn't find any new ones in stores that had been nearly as good as my old one--until finding this Toshiba! This Toshiba actually exceeded my expectations in every way, and I have been delighted with it since the very moment of taking it out of the box, because the quality and design of it had not only surpassed the much favored old toaster oven I'd liked so well, but also the design and quality of the many, many others I had looked at in all sorts of stores over the years, too. I'd expected I'd likely have to resign myself to settling for a toaster oven somewhat inferior to the one I had enjoyed using for many years, so opening the box to discover that this Toshiba was vastly superior to any others I had seen was a nearly transcendent experience. If you've suffered through trying to replace any good quality small kitchen appliance in the past decade or so, you'll certainly understand what I mean. All too often one has to end up settling for appliances that are more cheaply made, cease to work after only a few months, or don't work at all right out of the box! I'll be keeping the Toshiba brand in mind when making any future purchases, because I could not have been more pleased with the purchase of this toaster oven!",

This was a bit deeper than my old (large) Black and Decker oven which did not cook evenly and sounding like a mini helicopter while running. I am still amazed at the quietness of this oven. I hardly can tell that it's on when it's cooking, except for seeing great results. I love that this oven has a light in it as well. Easy to follow instruction booklet included, as is a drip tray, cooking tray, rotisserie tools and a handle to remove. I also love that it will cook 8 pieced of toast at a time. It is higher than my old oven and I'm looking forward to trying a rotisserie chicken one day soon. I couldn't be happier!",

                "reviewText": "Sent back a Hamilton Beach oven because it was extremely hot on sides and top. This oven has better insulation. The heat distributes well, especially good for making toast. Best placement of rack is displayed on the door for different functions. The digital timer counts down, then turns itself off. Very accurate. Everything works great so far. My only complaint is that there is no manual on setting. If you want to preheat, for example, you have to set for \"Toast\" or some other setting. Then you have to select a temperature and watch for the right temperature before the time runs out. It would be better to add a \"Preheat\" option to the selections available.",

                "reviewText": "We wanted to replace our old Kitchen Aid toaster oven, which was attractive but we never really loved it. It was very inconsistent when toasting/baking and I didn't like the rack positioning and how the rack slid out too easily when you didn't want it to.I debated over what to get next, looking at several options and reading all the reviews. I settled on this Toshiba and have been very pleased with it. It's attractive and a great size. It's very versatile and even allows you to tell it how many pieces of bread you are toasting so everything is toasted evenly. It's big enough to toast 6 slices at once. The pizza option is great too. Our Kitchen Aid didn't have that. We have yet to try all the options (cookies, rotisserie). Since it's doing such a great job, I should take advantage of its other features!I like how it looks substantial and more like an appliance than a breadbox. The stainless steel ties in nicely with our other kitchen appliances and fixtures.They one thing I wish it had, that our Kitchen Aid toaster oven had, is a crumb tray you can pull straight out from the outside/front. You can remove the Toshiba's tray, but you have to reach inside to do so.Otherwise, I highly recommend!",

You literally cannot hear a thing while it\u2019s working. Heats up fast cooks evenly and perfectly. No complaints at all.The only caveat I would add is to make sure that you\u2019re not wanting to put your 12 inch pizza pan in to make pizza as it will not fit in this toaster oven. I looked at so many models and I think I was mistaken when I ordered this one thinking that it was large enough for a 12 inch pizza pan. We\u2019ll just be making rectangles from now on.",

Excelente producto sin duda.+ Un horno super eficiente, para calentar 6 rebanadas de pizza congelada en 8 min y con solo 400 grados F. Quedar\u00e1, como reci\u00e9n hecha.+ Un pollo rostizado de 3 kilos, qued\u00f3 en su punto y dorado en 55 min ( obviamente, hay que ir , practicando para que puedas calcular la potencia y tiempo y modo de cocci\u00f3n ) +++ Costillar de res 2 piezas de 30cm ( \u00fanicamente dejar marinar 3horas con hierbas de olor y sal de mar ) en 35 min doradas y te aseguro te vale la pena! ++++ La charola de moronas es un poco inc\u00f3moda para sacarla y limpiarla, \u00fanicamente esperar a que se enfrie y como consejo, cuando la ingreses dejar de ser derecha, por qu\u00e9 si no... Quedar\u00e1 un poco de lado . Pero hasta atr\u00e1s ajusta perfectamente.+ La cocci\u00f3n es incre\u00edble, la mitad de tiempo de cualquier horno convencional.( La opci\u00f3n de convecci\u00f3n funciona excelente)+ Se calienta en la parte exterior obviamente y saca a veces un humo por la cocci\u00f3n, As\u00ed que es normal ( Pero , sin ning\u00fan problema )Finalmente, precio, calidad, funcionamiento, eficacia! Cumplen absolutamente las expectativas!Lo recomiendo al 100%P.d. no es un horno de microondas, es un horno donde puedes hacer papas fritas, casi sin aceite, pero puedes cocinar en la mitad de tiempo y quiz\u00e1s 1/3 de un horno convencional.",
