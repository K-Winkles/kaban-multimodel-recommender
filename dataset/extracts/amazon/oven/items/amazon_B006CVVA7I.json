Easy to use, light as a feather, takes up little room, and produces great results.All you do is turn the know at top to the appropriate setting: cookies, reheat, pizza, bagel, toast, bake, broil, roast.Then, at the middle panel, choose the temperature and time, leftmost and rightmost buttons respectively. Adjust these using center arrows up or down. It will PREHEAT, and beep when preheating is finished.You can check temperature and minutes left anytime, and adjust if you desire.At bottom, press the F or C button, upper left, to toggle between the two.At bottom, lower left, button for cooking frozen food.At bottom, right, press the A BIT MORE button for more time. I think it's an extra 5 to 7 minutes.At bottom, center, is the START or CANCEL button.This unit not only cooks very well, it also radiates heat out, but quite acceptably. It's hot, but not excessively so. The rear is the hottest. The right side, facing the unit, is the coolest.It comes with a really nice baking tray. Use parchment paper, and it should always look like new. There is a sturdy wire rack as well, that can fit in at three levels. And of course a multi-lingual manual: English, French, Spanish.I paid $152 because of a few points I had, but for the price, quite impressive. A pair of tennis shoes cost that, it's priced very reasonably, considering we are in Biden's inflationary economy!Bon app\u00e9tit!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent, compact, efficient toaster oven",
                "reviewText": "I just purchased this toaster, so I can't speak to the longevity, however, my first impressions are very favorable. My previous toaster oven was a larger model & different brand that had convection and other fancy add-ons. Trouble was it took 6:30 min (390 sec) to get toast brown to my liking. I had a suspicion that larger toaster ovens with multiple features may be trying to do too much and fail more on individual tasks. After reading lots of reviews, I decided on Breville, but purposefully chose the smallest option (BOV450XL Mini Smart Oven with Element IQ) with the fewest features. I predominately use this appliance to toast pre-buttered bread, keep plates warm, broil individual servings of food and bake dinner sides (roasted baby potatoes etc.). If you are looking for an oven replacement, this review may not be as helpful. That caveat aside, I ran some tests and have been impressed with the efficiency and consistency of this toaster.One of the best features of this toaster is that it remembers your last setting for a given function. If you always want #2 toast, you don't have to hit the down arrow every time. You turn the dial to toast and hit the start button. Nice. If you like to warm plates for dinner, you can dedicate the ROAST setting to 120\u00b0F and have the bake setting default to something like 350\u00b0F. Nice! The dial makes changing between settings efficient and the buttons all have a positive feel but will little travel giving good tactile feedback that the input has been registered with a sense of durability.Because the unit is small, the 1800W coils are able to heat it rapidly. The toasting color is consistent across the piece of bread and was consistent from test to test for the same setting assuming the toaster had a chance to cool fully (more on this later). The outside is well toasted and the center is warmed and steaming but not even with the outside. This is in contrast to my last toaster that seemed to desiccate the bread as it slowly came up to temperature (again, I suspect the large toaster ovens sacrifice toasting ability to include other features).I have included pictures of toasted bread for reference as I was frustrated in my own search that this was very hard to find. The bread is Kroger brand white bread. In the first series, I have displayed all settings on plain bread from un-toasted to #7 setting (360 sec). The toaster was allowed to cool fully between each piece of bread. The default setting is #4 (160 sec), but my personal preference is a bit darker (#5, 180 sec). The underside of the bread does not get as toasted as can be seen in the photos but this is understandable given the rack.The second set of photos is for bread that had been pre-buttered with about 1/2 tsp of butter per slice on one side only. Here, my decided preference is #5 again. It is interesting to note that adding butter slows the browning of the top side without affecting the underside making the overall toast more even.Following are pictures of my one gripe about the unit. The Element IQ (mislabeled SmartIQ in the picture) does not work perfectly. I toasted three pieces of bread on #5 (180 sec) consecutively, taking the first out, immediately putting a second in and hitting start again. The toaster is programed to account for the fact that it is already warmed. As a result, the duration of toasting for the second slice on #5 was 152 sec and for the third, 146 sec. As you can see, the second and third are consistent with each other but lighter than the first slice, matching closer to #3 from earlier tests. Again, I found that if the unit cools fully and resets to the full time duration, the color is consistent from round to round. Therefore, if you are only using it once every morning, you will consistently have the same toast each time, if you have one day where you are feeding a crowd, maybe up the toasting on the following slices to keep color consistent. This is a small deficiency.The final set of pictures shows what happens when the #4 setting is used and the \"a bit more\" button is pressed at the end of the toast cycle (brings it closer to a #5). Also shown is what happens if you \"forget about the toast\" and leave it in the oven after the cycle is complete until the unit cools down (Does not appreciably darken the bread).Hopefully this review is helpful. If I gain more insights regarding baking/broiling ability or consistency or if I have any mechanical issues I will update the review. (current version May 2020)",

                "reviewText": "I just received my toaster oven yesterday. The packaging was sturdy and the oven unpacked in perfect condition. I ran it through the \u201cstart-up cycle\u201d, let it cool down, and then baked a chicken pot pie. It was perfectly golden and flaky. Also, the controls on the front of the oven are simple and easy to understand. How many appliances or electronics do we own that are so complex we never use half of the features? It\u2019s also lightweight, which makes it easy to move.We have a minuscule kitchen, so the size is probably about as large as I would want. I think I can bake, broil, or roast about anything for everyday meals, since it\u2019s just my husband and I. Obviously, I\u2019d be using the regular oven for a Thanksgiving turkey! I tried my 9\u201dx9\u201d Longaberger baking dish in the oven, and it fits. So, it\u2019s great thus far\u2026 I\u2019m trying a pizza tonight.As I spent hours reading reviews on this oven over the past several weeks, I had these observations regarding complaints from negative reviewers, some of which seem to be from \u201cglass half empty\u201d folks:1. \u201cIt gets hot on the outside\u201d\u2026 yes, and so does your slow cooker, your coffee pot, or a pan on the stove. The instructions tell you that you need to leave room around the oven.2. \u201cThe crumb tray doesn\u2019t slide all the way into the oven\u201d. I think most of these reviewers have it upside down. When I was putting in the crumb tray, it extended out the front of the oven and I thought these reviews were right. Then I turned it over and it fit perfectly.3. \u201cIt clicks\u201d. Yes, it does click when the heating rods turn on and off, but not loudly. That\u2019s how it works to keep the temperature correct.4. \u201cIt beeps loudly\u201d. It beeps three times when the oven comes to temp, to let you know it\u2019s ready for the food. My dryer buzzes when the cycle is done, and the tv has a chime when you turn it on or off. That\u2019s life.5. \u201cThe labels on the door showing where to place the rack for the various functions clutter the look of the oven\u201d. Really? They\u2019re small and on the side of the door by the controls anyway. I am glad I don\u2019t have to continually refer to the manual.6. \u201cThere is no interior light\u201d. I think that\u2019s probably because the oven is small. You can just open the door and check your food if necessary.7. \u201cIt has an odd plug with a finger hole that sticks out too far\u201d. I think Breville modified the plug sometime over the years, because my oven has a flat round plug.8. The rack doesn\u2019t auto-slide out when you open the door. I purchased a silicone push/pull tool very inexpensively on Amazon. It works perfectly with this oven. Or just use an oven mitt.I also purchased the cutting board for the top of the oven, the pizza pan, and the broiling pan. Just make sure you get the ones for the 450XL.This Breville oven seems just right for us. I will do an update if anything changes.",

                "reviewTitle": "A great helper in my everyday cooking!",
                "reviewText": "I have been using this toaster oven for over two years, so I think I am now in a position to write a review on it. The following is my comments:Price: I did considerable research before I made the purchase. At the time of my purchase, Amazon offered the best price which was at least CAD$20 cheaper than any online stores or retailers in Vancouver.Design: It has a sleek and clean design in matt stainless steel which, I think, will go with any classic or contemporary kitchen design. The interior matt stainless steel and the sliding crumb tray make cleaning easy and convenient. The control panel has a user-friendly design, and the function dial, LCD screen and buttons for various settings are all large and easy to read and use. The LCD screen indicates if the oven is preheating, and when it reaches the pre-set temperature, the cooking time will start counting down automatically throughout the cooking cycle. It is almost a fool-proof design!Functions: We use the Toast function almost every day. It can toast up to 4 slices of bread at a time and the browning settings range from 1 to 7 (the darkest). However, I have never made a toast with browning setting higher than 3 and it usually takes no more than 2 minutes to brown a toast to my desired crispiness. The Bagel function is good for toasting bagel, or reheating a pizza or open sandwich as it gives out higher temperature to the top without burning the bottom of the toast.Before the Bake, Roast, Reheat and Pizza functions operate, it first starts at the pre-heating mode. This mini oven takes quite a short time to preheat and can reach a temperature of 425F within just 3 minutes. This saves a lot of energy compared to my conventional oven.The Broil function does not require preheating and therefore makes it a great helper in my cooking. This is particular helpful when you do stir-frying and want to sear certain ingredients, such as fish or meat slices, before mixing them with other ingredients which require just quick stir-frying. I never use my conventional oven for searing because it will cost so much time and energy for preheating.My limited experience with the Pizza function is not particularly good because it tends to make the pizza crust too dry and hard. Perhaps I just need more practice. This oven is large enough for a 10 inch pizza.Special notes:The 'A Bit More' button is a super design and we use it all the time! If the food is not yet cooked to our desired liking at the end of the cooking cycle, we press this button to add just a bit more time to continue the cooking cycle. For example, by pressing the button once, it adds 30 seconds to Toast, 2 minutes to Broil, and 5 minutes to Bake, etc. I can use this button anytime during the cooking cycle or immediately after.This oven has three rack positions where you can place the wire rack. In the manual, it suggests the top position for Broil. I must say that I have never used the top position for any function because this will leave your food very close to the top heating element and you will get it burnt easily for whatever function you use. Similarly, when I use the bottom rack position for Bake or Roast, I sometimes find the bottom of the food a bit too dark. I cannot use the middle rack position for Bake or Roast because the overall interior height is just about 4.5 inches and there is not enough 'height' to move around some food, such as a medium-sized potato or yam. If I were to redesign it, I would just spread the interior height of the oven evenly into two rack positions so that in either rack position, the food will not be too close to the heating element.This mini oven has quite a loud and sharp beeper and it sounds once every time you press any button and three times at the end of the preheating or cooking cycle. I find it a bit annoying, but over time have got used to it. I mentioned it because it might be a nuisance to other members of your household if your kitchen is near a study room or bedroom.Finally, I need to mention that the top of the oven can get very hot during its operation and it sometimes warm up my upper kitchen cabinet a bit. Therefore you need to make sure that there is sufficient clearance between the top of the oven and your upper cabinets. Also, when I Bake or Roast, I would pull the oven a bit away from the backsplash so that the oven is not directly under the upper cabinets. I can also 're-direct' the heat by placing a plate or a cooked dish on the top of the oven and use it as a warming tray.Conclusion: My husband and I both agreed that this was one of the best small appliances we had purchased. What we thought would be used primarily for making toasts or reheating leftovers has turned out to be a great helper in my everyday cooking. I gave it 5 stars even though there is room for improvement. If there was the choice, I would have given it four and a half stars. This Breville Mini Smart Oven is the smallest one in its series and it also comes in two other sizes. I highly recommend this mini oven to small households and would advise bigger households to consider the larger ones. By coincidence, my sister-in-law has been using the largest one for more than two years for her growing family.",

I've made salmon, reheated mousaka, and toasted the best bagels. It is very easy to use with precise controls down to the minute. Heats evenly. Doesn't take up too much counter space. Instruction manual is quick and easy to read. Arrived in two days. Very happy with this purchase. Life is too short to put up with burnt toast!",

My only minor complaint is that I have to pull the crumb tray out a few inches in order for the door to open all the way (it\u2019s possible I have the crumb tray in wrong but I don\u2019t see how else it could go!). I followed the instructions and heated it to 425 for 15 minutes to burn off any protective coating on the inside\u2026 put it on top of the stove and turned the range hood fan on high (it\u2019s vented outside) and when I used it after, there was no smell at all (one of the complaints I read in the reviews of some other models).
