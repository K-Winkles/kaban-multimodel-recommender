                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Small Counter Profile, Big Performance",
                "reviewText": "After roughly a month of daily use, I am very happy with my purchase of Fabuletta's countertop toaster oven. My household consists of two pesco-vegetarian adults. I do not need a large countertop oven to roast chickens, for instance. If you need that, this oven is not for you.The ten different settings work well and foods cook quickly. Toasting bread is excellent--the best I've ever found in a toaster oven, although I question the claim that you can toast nine slices at once. The nine slices of bread would have to be quite small. Four fit easily, six may be possible, depending upon size. The degree of toasting is easily adjusted and is evenly distributed over both sides of the slices. The bagel setting only toasts the top side of the bagel.It may take a little practice to get used to adjusting the temperature and time. But it's simple: You just press the temperature and/or time buttons until the setting starts flashing, then adjust the temperature/time up or down by turning the dial. Press the temperature/time buttons again, and it's set. The dial also serves as the start and pause button when pressed. The included manual tells you everything you need to know about the available settings, accessed by rotating this dial. It also includes a number of recipes.I would have liked to have had a dedicated defrost setting but the reheat setting serves that function pretty well.The oven comes with a mesh air fry basket, a wire rack for toasting items, and a nonstick bake pan which also is also used with air frying to catch dripping oil. The nonstick coating appears to be ceramic but there is no information given about that in the manual.I am new to air frying. I have used that setting only a few times so far, for french fries, both store-bought frozen ones, and fresh ones I've cut up myself, and some frozen fish sticks. It may be more my technique than the fault of the oven but I have not been overly pleased with the results.I love the matted dark exterior finish of this oven. It looks really nice and expensive. It's easy to keep clean and never shows fingerprints, unlike stainless steel which, in my opinion, is difficult to keep looking nice. However, this exterior, top and back especially, gets very hot when the temperature is set at 400-450 degrees so it's important not to have it close to anything that may be combustible. It is easily pulled away from the wall, however, unless you have a tile or stone backsplash in which case there is no need to do that. For this reason, too, it's nice that this oven is not so tall as to be close to any cabinet under which it might be placed.The easy-to-clean crumb catcher sits on the bottom, completely covering the bottom. It is easy to slide out, clean, and reinsert. The door opens and lays flat, out of the way of removing the trays and pans.I spent close to a year researching toaster ovens, hoping to find the perfect one for my needs, my small kitchen, and my wallet. The decision was hard, but I feel I have made the right one. My only hope now is that the Fabuletta toaster oven gives me years of service.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My expectations were surpassed by the exceptional cooking capacities, forward-thinking design, and convenient space-saving features of this countertop convection oven that has 10 functions in one. The adaptability of this device is unquestionably one of its strongest selling points. This oven has 10 distinct cooking activities, including air frying, baking, toasting, broiling, and many more. As a result, it can accommodate a wide variety of culinary requirements and fulfill all of them. It is able to provide excellent and reliable results every time, whether you are making flawlessly crisp french fries or properly cooked pizza. I have had a lot of fun trying out different recipes, and every meal that I have made has turned out to be a real treat for my taste buds. The food is cooked to perfection thanks to the uniform distribution of heat and excellent temperature control, which results in the food having a crisp outside while maintaining a moist inside after cooking. The air-frying capability is one of the most outstanding aspects of this appliance. It eliminates the need for extra oil, which means I can enjoy crisp delicacies without feeling guilty about them. The meal comes out golden and crispy, resembling the results of conventional frying techniques but with a more positive spin on one's health. The air fryer function produces delicious results, ranging from chicken wings to onion rings, but without the oily residue that is often left behind. It has rapidly evolved into my preferred way of cooking since it allows me to get a lovely crunch without compromising the flavor of the food.",

                "reviewText": "I was able to eliminate two older appliances with this purchase. It fits easily into a very small space! The \u2018air fry/air roast feature works well. Using an air fryer liner to catch drips on the tray.I\u2019ve recommended it to others who are in need of an all - inclusive kitchen tool.Note to the manufacturer:At this moment, my only negative comment would be: the slide out toast rack needs to have the same \u2018tray /rack stop\u2019 that is designed in full sized ovens - enabling you to pull out the rack & it stays put, as you re-group and remove your food.This rack/tray is extremely hot after doing its job and as you start to remove it, it totally tips downward, sliding out nearly dumping whatever you were cooking.Other than that I still love it.",

It fits comfortably on the kitchen counter andcan be re-positioned upright to save on counter space when not in use. Don't let the compact size deter you; it can cook a sizeable family meal. The oven is very functional with a roast function that does an excellent job on a variety of dishes from vegetables to beef roast like petite tenders, chicken, pork loin, fish and other such dishes, not to mention traditional fries and surprisingly plantains. This air fryer/oven is well worth the price and so far I am very satisfied with this purchase",

It not only cooks in several settings (bake, air fry and broil), it make the best toast I've ever had because of the even toasting on both sides of the bread/bagel, etc. I highly recommend this toaster oven!",
