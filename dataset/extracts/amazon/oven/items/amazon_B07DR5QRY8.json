                "reviewText": "I LOVE this oven! So far, I've baked perfect cornbread, a nicely browned Thanksgiving turkey, and a casserole in a 9\" x13\" baking dish. (I measured the oven space, with broiler pan in, before purchasing the turkey, to be sure it would fit.). The oven is simple to use; since I preheat, I have been turning the top and bottom element knobs to the desired temp, then the bottom, timer knob to the left for continuous heat, then put the food in to cook when it is up to heat. I just set an timer with Alexa. Alternatively, one could set the timer on the oven longer to allow for preheat time (it heats up quickly!).I detest cleaning ovens but this gem is easily wiped out - even after the turkey! I used a simple kitchen sponge with a little detergent, then rinsed it well. Even though there is no internal light, tbe oven is so roomy, and sitting at counter height, easy to reach inside to wipe out. I'd noticed comments by others saying no crumb tray was included and tbought the same until I checked very carefully - it's there and covers the base very well, just unobtrusive!There are two wire racks; one of them easily held my old, heavy, Pyrex baking dish with handles tonight (I tried it in tbe oven before filling to make sure it fit). The included, enameled baking pan worked perfectly for the turkey - I sprayed it first as usual and used a small rack under tbe bird. Like the oven, the pan was very,very easy to clean with just a kitchen sponge,nylon scrubber and dish soap.I saw some negative comments about the doors and heat loss, but the doors on my unit meet perfectly and I don't believe there is undue heat loss (this is heavy glass, similar to tbe glass in a regular oven door). The right hand door on mine does want to close a bit when I open it wide so I just place a kitchen towel on the counter there a moment to hold it open if necessary. There is a wire handle to use in pulling out the baking pan or racks; it works well but one needs to do that slowly, carefully, as at the midpoint, if heavy, it could tip forward and out. I was prepared with an oven mitt and potholder, though, so no problem.I'm extremely pleased with this oven, its practicality, simplicity and ease of use!",

The timer makes a quiet tick, but there are no fans blowing (all fancy ovens now have fans). Controls are very straightforward and reliable. The timer max is one hour.1. The oven has to be level for the doors to stay shut. We had no issue.2. The trays are in brown cardboard at the bottom of the box. Don\u2019t toss them.3. It\u2019s not a convection oven. You don\u2019t want a noisy convection oven drying your food out.We are looking at an Aga range, but we will keep this little oven.",

                "reviewText": "Love everything about this oven. Works great! Threw out my stove and brought in this oven plus a couple hot plates and I\u2019m so pleased with the results. All the extra workspace I have is wonderful and I have an oven timer which I have not had for years. Read reviews about how hot it gets so I placed it on a fireproof pad. Turned out to be unnecessary. It doesn\u2019t get that hot and the feet not hot at all. Someone complained one of the doors doesn\u2019t stay open. That\u2019s because it\u2019s not sitting level. Use your brains people. I does get hot on the outside so don\u2019t lean on it. It\u2019s an oven. Hot is good.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: August 02, 2022Removed 1 star because of durabilityI have had this oven about 14 months now. I have used this at least twice a week since we got it. It worked great, I baked everything in it, except it just wouldn't cook baked potatoes in a reasonable amount of time for some reason.Anyway, about the first week in July 2022, I noticed that things weren't cooking properly, so I did the normal, added time and turned up the heat.I have now used an oven thermometer and with the oven set at 475, both top and bottom, the oven is only reaching 350. I still use it because most of what I use it for cooks at 350, but I have made adjustments to what I cook in it.When I found this oven, I was looking for a convection oven. I am so glad I got this instead. This is a great oven. It is large enough to use regular size pans (cookie sheets, cake pans etc.) I bake at the same temp and time as in my regular oven. You can set the timer or set it to stay on. I like the timer feature. I have this in my pantry; that is part of an enclosed porch; so I can use it without heating the whole house.I saw in some of the reviews that the shelves were flimsy and broke, but they are as good as any in the other counter ovens I have used. What seems to be the problem with them is that they are slightly too short for the length of the oven. I was thinking of maybe wrapping the ends with foil and see if that helped, but I haven't done it yet. Because they are short, the racks will sometimes come out and drop when you try to take something out of the oven, so make sure and have a good oven mitt or holder.The right hand door tends to close about half way when you are taking stuff out. I got a short bungee cord and hooked it to a handle on the counter I have and when I open the oven door, I open the right side first and catch it with the bungee, no problem.It is probably big enough to cook a turkey in, but I really don't think I would. With something that big and heavy, I am pretty sure the racks would drop out of the slots when you tried to take the pan out. I have cooked a large roast in it though.Another thing is that not all of temperature settings are marked. It is marked in 100 degree increments, starting at 150. 150, 250. 350 & 450. So when I need 375, I figure about a fourth of the distance between 350 & 450. It has worked so far. If you are really concerned, get an oven thermometer.Reading back over this, this sounds like a negative review, but it isn't really, I just listed the things I have noticed I have had to deal with. On the up side, it seems to cook at the correct temps and for the correct length of time. I didn't have to buy special pans to fit it, it runs on 110 current and doesn't trip my breakers in my old house. The time feature is great, because I don't always hear the ding. When it is done, the oven shuts off if you use the timer.When you set the heat, the oven won't come on until the either the timer is set, or the setting is set to stay on. I think that is suppose to be a safety feature.",

                "reviewText": "The information on this site for this product, is extremely vague and contradicting.It says both 1800w and 2200w for same product.It also says white, black and silver.And both 16 slices and 18 slices for same product.It's not obvious what come with it since many reviewers mentioned not getting a crumb tray and there is no mention of anything except the photo.So this is what I got.It is black and silver.That's what I wanted, but the order said I was getting white, so I'm happy.It uses 1800w, I tested it a full power up to 450deg both elements and did not trip my 15A circuit breaker.I also inserted a reliable baking thermometer and found the oven temperature very reliable.As mentioned in instructions, the oven smells really bad on first use, as the protective coating on eliments burn off.So I recommend breaking it in at full heat before putting food in.And be prepared to ventalate, as it does smell strong.It comes with 2 racks a baking tray and yes a crumb tray.The doors are strong, fit straight and close properly, seperatly with magnets.And it's size makes it easy to clean, with my big hands.I love the old school mentality,.No useless pre-programmed buttons that don't apply or work.Oh, and the picture, says the top element thermostat is 450 and bottom 350.That's not a misprint both dails are 450deg, but the bottom element alone, may not get the oven to 450.This is not a problem, this oven works great.I am completely satisfied with this large but simple to use product at the moment.Except for 2 small things.The feet are slippery, so it's really easy to push around, so you need to be carefullSo I put some rubber pads under the feet, that fixed the problem.And the direction indicators on the knobs, are the same color as the knobs, making them difficult to see.I put very small dabs of white cilicon caulking, as shown in the picture, now I can see them. This oven is a great example of a KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid ) mentality, and I love it.The photos, show the unit with my pizza stone (not included) on bottom rackAnd a black non stick liner(not included) in the crumb tray.",
