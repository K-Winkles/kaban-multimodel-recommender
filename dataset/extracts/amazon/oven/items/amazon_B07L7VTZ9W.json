Good size Does not appear to Air fry food as quickly as other models but works. Poor instructions and the function buttons are small and hard to read. Reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "I have had B&D toaster ovens in the past. They worked competently. After three months this timer stopped working. What good is it!Update: I called Black and Decker. The young lady who answered the phone was EXCELLENT. (Please forgive me that I do not recall your name.) She was quick and knowledgeable. The next day I got a tracking number for the new replacement they were sending me. I have received it and using it in less than week.I must say that there are many other companies out there that should take a page out of B&D's book on customer service. Black and Decker's response wall all-around EXCELLENT. Thank you!",

No convect bake and its toaster ability is marginal.Does not toast evenly. Warms up cold pizza pretty well. You get what you pay for. It\u2019ll do until more toasters are available without \u201cforever chemicals\u201d",

I think I unpacked this on the 5th of February.February 7 2024- Temperature control is what just killed and burned my brownies.When I first checked the temp just out of the box. I set the dial to 350. According to my oven thermometer (new) it only heated to 325 degrees. I could deal with that.Last night baked two potatoes, they came out a little dry.This morning I tried to bake a batch of brownies. set the temp to 325 (according to my oven thermometer). 15 minutes into the bake time, I smelled brownies burning. I pulled the pan out of the oven, and the top is burned! I left the oven open to cool it down. Turned the oven back on after it had cooled. It struggled to to get to 300 degrees, eventually it got back to 325 degrees. Currently I am trying to get my brownies cooked, and my house smells like burned brownies.Temperature control is the problem. I now have smoking brownies.Now I can not trust this oven to cook my food competently.I am so disappointed.I am sending this back!Another thing. This oven has the shortest cord ever! Where is it supposed to reach? I am glad I have an outlet it can reach. For anyone else, good luck!Feb 8 2024- I decided to give this a second try. This time to cook 2 sausages. I turned on the oven to 350 (what ever it thinks 350 is) 10 minutes later it was at 250 degrees, another 10 minutes later it got to 325degrees. After a whole 30 minutes the sausages are not cooked, and it is trying to burn the tops of them.I'm done with this. Now I don't know what to trust.",
