                "reviewText": "I got this for my mom as a stocking stuffer this Christmas. I honestly expected it to be one of those things that ended up in a drawer somewhere never to be used again... but it was not at all! After our festivities, our family went on to use both our oven and toaster oven to prepare a holiday meal. We probably used this at least a dozen times during that process. My mom raved about it! I could hardly believe it. What I thought was going to be a \"filler\" type item, was one of the best received gifts I gave all season! She actually had a much simpler version of one of these before, which I didn't know, but it wasn't as hefty and also didn't have a shape profile that was as effective. The deep notches in this one mean that the racks don't slip and the additional silicone rack covers still allow the device to easily pull the racks out. That's another thing I wasn't expecting - that she'd use the rack liners. They're simple silicone tubes that are made to simply cover the front portion of an oven cooking rack. I got this pack because it was cheaper than the others and I figured if the covers worked - bonus. Well, they did work and my mom loved those too.Point is, this is a simple object that just does it's task really efficiently. It's got two different notches to pull out racks, is hefty enough to hold without slipping, and then had a different notch to push the racks back in. Simple. Easy. Effective. It's not something I'd give as a gift alone as it's so simple, but for a stocking stuffer it absolutely won the day.",

I haven't actually tried to touch it, but I feel safer knowing if I do, it'll be mostly covered in something that won't hurt as bad as metal.Now, the puller - it works. It just is not comfortable to hold at all. This sounds like a small thing, but it's the kind of uncomfortable where you don't want to pick it up at all. The wood isn't entirely smooth - it isn't splintery, per se, but it feels like it could be, or may become so later. It is also flat. It's meant to be held in a specific direction, but it is flat in the opposite direction. It feels like holding a ruler in your fist. It makes it very difficult to use.Given that this also feels like an aid for a disabled or elderly person, and it's something used in and near an oven, the shape of the item should fit into the hand easily and be safer to use.",

However they do cover the most likely places that could burn you and they do help.I somewhat like the rack puller for checking on food when I need to stir or baste something in the oven but if I am pulling food out of the oven I already have pot holders so there is no need for a puller at that point. I don\u2019t find the rack puller as useful as I thought I would but it also does work.",

The guards have a split that allows you to simply press them against the outer part of each of the oven racks. The puller is really great, in that you don\u2019t have to touch the racks to pull them outwards to remove the hot dishes that are on them; just hook the puller from under the rack, and slide the rack towards you. You can also use it to push the rack back into the oven. If you want the guard for a smaller appliance, like a toaster oven, it\u2019s very easy to cut to the length of that appliance. I recommend this item.",

                "reviewText": "These are an absolute lifesaver, I didn't realize how often me and my family were burning ourselves on the edges of the racks. The rack puller is also wonderful, and does quite well whether you have the covers on the racks or not. You definitely have a wonderful amount of control when you're pulling out the rack, and it's very easy to push the rack back in with the top of the puller.",
