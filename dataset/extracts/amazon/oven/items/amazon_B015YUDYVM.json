                "reviewText": "I bought this toaster oven in October 2019 to replace a nice Cuisinart toaster oven whose bottom element had warped and eventually, literally, flamed out after three years of everyday use. My criteria for its replacement were pretty basic: cheap, easy to use and clean, fairly small, attractive and stainless steel exterior. This toaster oven seemed to check all those boxes so I purchased it, $48.99 at the time. It gets used daily, sometimes even twice a day.Pros: small footprint; easy to clean; adequately (though not very evenly) toasts bread, English muffins, bagels, hotdog and hamburger buns. Operation is straightforward.Cons: it is very easy to burn your food due to the fussy timer dial - NEVER step away to do something else while you wait for your food to toast. The included pan warps when heated - luckily I saved the one that came with my previous toaster oven. And frozen appetizers and mini-pizzas always seem to need 10 minutes or more than the cooking directions state on their packaging; after several disappointing tries I finally just stuck to toasting bread products.So after adjusting to this toaster oven's shortcomings for nearly two years, today I was horrified to find the bottom front corner inside the door is rusting. My guess is the moisture that naturally evaporates and then runs down the glass during toasting has been condensing at this spot, leading to the rust. As you can see from my photos I have taken excellent care of this unit, so the rust is not from any abuse on my part.So there's my two cents - adequate but not spectacular results. I'm glad I didn't pay what is being asked for it now. And now my search begins for its replacement as rust on an electrical appliance makes me very nervous....",

Unfortunately, they no longer made the previous model, so we got this one. For starters, it's small. Our previous model was not a lot bigger, but it seemed to be able to fit more food in it.Then there is how it actually performs. Not well. It burns most things and does a terrible job of cooking them evenly. The previous model had the little heat lamps above and below in multiple locations within the oven. This one has two and flimsy little heat shields to help disperse the heat more evenly, which they fail at. Not to mention, if anything were to melt and fall on these heat shields, there doesn't appear to be a way to remove them without pulling the oven apart, so cleaning them is really not easy.Some good things though, it is simple and straight forward to use. The settings are simple.Unfortunately, we weren't using it very frequently in the beginning, so it didn't bother us very much. By the time it started really bugging us, it was too late to return it.",

Hasta ahora lo hemos usado para calentar bolillo y gratinar chayotes con queso (el bolillo se dora de m\u00e1s en las orillas superiores que son m\u00e1s delgaditas en opci\u00f3n de Pan Claro, o sea, tiene buena potencia).Estuve preguntando sobre medidas, ya que no vienen en el instructivo, pero no eran claras las contestaciones por aqu\u00ed, as\u00ed que les pongo en fotos las medidas, ya que es muy diferente las medidas del horno por fuera, a las medidas de los espacios que son realmente \u00fatiles.Pros: Excelente para espacios peque\u00f1os, bonito, se calienta r\u00e1pido, se limpia f\u00e1cil, es pr\u00e1ctico, somos 3 en casa y nos es suficiente para lo que lo usamos (para cosas grandes usamos el horno de la estufa).Contras: El espacio de 11 cm entre ambas l\u00e1minas de la resistencia se me hace muy chiquito, me hubiera gustado que fuera m\u00e1s grande, la charola es m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a que la rejilla, as\u00ed que conservamos la anterior charola que ten\u00edamos y la usamos si ocupamos un poquito m\u00e1s de espacio, tambi\u00e9n notamos que se est\u00e1 manchando del acero inoxidable de la superficie de arriba (el otro horno que ten\u00edamos tambi\u00e9n le pas\u00f3) me imagino por el calor que emana, para que no les sorprenda, y por \u00faltimo el cable es corto, as\u00ed que tienen que tener un enchufe cerca.En general, estamos contentos y hasta ahora funcionando de maravilla. Espero que les sirva las medidas, porque estaba con el nervio de que cupiera en el espacio del anterior horno y s\u00ed cupo, pero si hubiera tenido esta informaci\u00f3n, probablemente lo hubiera comprado un poquito m\u00e1s grande, porque es ligeramente m\u00e1s chico que el que ten\u00eda.
