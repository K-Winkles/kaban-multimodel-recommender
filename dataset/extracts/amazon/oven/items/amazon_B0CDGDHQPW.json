I do not see it getting too hot or the fan being too loud, as others noted in reviews; but I have not used the air fryer setting yet.I feel the fan is very quiet \ud83e\udd2b even after it\u2019s completed the cycle.I highly recommend for appearance, stability, ease of use and it cleans up with no issues.I also like it was Italian designed which shows with the workmanship and overall quality.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "Updating my review again...I am pleased to notice that after my initial review complaining of the inaccurate color description, not only does the following review update apply, but the seller actually renamed the color description from Black Stainless to Metallic Gray. Awesome that they cared enough to do that, and I do believe that is an accurate description of the color.I am updating my previous review of this product for 3 reasons.1. The seller went above and beyond to earn our satisfaction. They genuinely wanted us to be pleased with their product and they did not make any excuses, just wanted to resolve the issue if possible. Due to the fact that our issue was with color/description rather than actual product performance, we decided to keep the product to see how it actually performs.2. Upon rereading the description of color, I am wondering if the issue was more of a language or wording issue, versus outright incorrect color description. The product stated it was Black Stainless. We have other Black Stainless appliances, so assumed this would be the same color. But now I believe that the seller meant Black AND Stainless vs Black Stainless, as the sides are black and the front is regular stainless. So perhaps more of an accident with wording. Despite being initially disappointed that it wasn't colored as expected, it is a classy looking little machine.3. We have used the oven 7 or 8 times and actually are very pleased with its operation. It cooks quickly and evenly and we have no complaints with it thus far. We haven't used all the functions, but toast and airfry get 5/5 stars so far.Changing my overall review to 5 stars because we are very pleased with the oven's cooking ability as well as the excellent customer service.Thanks Val Cucina!Original post:We ordered this Val Cucina Air Fryer Toaster Oven in black stainless steel because our other appliances are black stainless steel and this product had good user reviews. BE AWARE that despite the fact that this is called a Black Stainless Steel product, only the sides and top are black stainless. The entire front is regular stainless steel color. And since the front of the product is the majority of what you see, it completely clashes with our other black stainless steel appliances. So very frustrating given that the color was 90% of the reason we ordered this product. It is going straight back to Amazon. Not even going to plug it in. Extremely disappointed in the deceptive color name of this product.",

I have an older air fryer, however this new air fryer really works much better. The food again cooks more quickly. It seems that with the drip tray inside the oven compartment - and easy to see - it will be much easier to keep clean. All in all I REALLY like this product.",
