Cleaning up afterwards is simple too thanks to the stainless steel construction and dishwasher-safe accessories. With its 23L/24QT capacity and three rack oven positions I can customize the baking settings to accommodate anything I want to bake. This gives me a level of control that I'm not able to achieve when using presets found on most countertop ovens. The intuitive knob controls make adjustments easy; simply set the timer, temperature, function (Warm, Broil, Toast, Bake and Air Fry) or fan speed (Low/High) as needed.Baking, roasting and Air Frying in this oven is easy and highly customizable. With 1700 watts of power and 6 precision heating elements, meals are cooked faster than my conventional oven. The air fryer option means I can cook with less fat, giving me healthier options for our favorite dishes. I paired the unit with a 10-inch square baking pan and baked some tasty chocolate brownies.I would recommend the KitchenBoss to anyone looking for an efficient, highly customizable, healthy cooking option in an attractive, easy to operate countertop oven that won't break the bank!",

                "reviewText": "I have had several toaster ovens over the years. I wanted this one for the air fryer feature. That particular option does work very well. I like it much better than the air fryer I tried that had the tiny basket on the bottom. This is a nice size - you can fit a frozen pizza in it and taller dishes, too. I really hate the timer and the way it works as the on/off switch. It is difficult to set to exact times, it is noisy, and I don't want to have to babysit my cooking food. The same for the temperature control. You have to basically guess at in between temps. I really prefer a digital read out. It cleans easily and I do like the 3 levels for putting the trays in. I am a little unclear about the high/low button. It seems to work like a convection oven where the food cooks faster on high but there is absolutely nothing in the scanty set of instructions included. I about 65% like this and 35% don't. I do like the air fryer enough to keep it, though, as I loved fried foods but don't need the grease.",
