We can now make quick snacks for us and our kids, save time on bigger meals, save time washing as many dishes, and all to still have a great and tasty bite! What I love about this air fryer is all the different settings you can set it to, and can even move the racks around to your preferred liking, if you need some things cooking slower than others. I would 100% recommend this amazing life changer to anyone who loves to eat but hates time in the kitchen!",

The 360\u00b0 turbo-flow technology is a game-changer\u2014making my food golden and crispy with a whopping 85% less oil. The 8+2 cooking presets are a dream; with just one touch, I can whip up fries, wings, bacon, and more without breaking a sweat. What's even better? It cooks faster, saving me time and energy. I've noticed my fries, steaks, and chicken are done in a flash, and it's a real energy-saver compared to traditional cooking methods.The classic design is a winner too. The internal light lets me peek at the food's progress with just a touch, and the stainless steel and classic color scheme fit seamlessly into my kitchen decor. Oh, and let's talk about the warranty\u2014it comes with a solid one-year guarantee, and the specs are spot-on for my kitchen needs. If you're on the lookout for an air fryer that's efficient, stylish, and a breeze to use, the Kitchen Elite is the way to go. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I had the ninja air fryer toaster for a few years- worked great but honestly got dirty quickly and was difficult to clean. So I wanted a cheap , large basket air fryer and took a chance on this.Super easy to use, super easy to clean and even surprised me with automatically stopping for a second to beep a minute to tell you to turn the food halfway through cooking time!I\u2019ve used it about 8 times since I bought it two Months ago - no issues.",

                "reviewText": "The first time I used this, I cooked a chicken breast in the fryer basket. Chicken juice dripped on the crumb tray, and after I hand washed it with Dawn and a nylon dish brush, it left behind permanent marks where the metal had oxidized where the drips were. See the picture. First use. Is this normal? So bummed.****UPDATED****Very impressed with customer service. I did not contact them, but they saw my review and contacted me. They offered to send me an entirely new unit, which was not necessary. I told them I would appreciate a new crumb tray, and they were happy to send me one. They actually sent me a whole set of the inserts/racks, so I have extras. I do recommend that if you want to keep the crumb tray and the pan looking shiny and new, line them with foil when you use them, because fats and juices do seem to oxidize the metal.Otherwise, I'm pretty satisfied with this air fryer unit. You have to play with it to get used to it and adjust settings as needed. For example, the default toast setting burned my toast, so I learned I had to change the time from 6 to 4 minutes to get it perfect. You just have to get the hang of it a little.Also, I didn't understand how to preheat the oven, or how you could tell when it had reached the desired temperature. I emailed customer service and they replied within a day or two and explained it to me. That was also nice. I do think it is a good company, and a pretty good little unit.",

The removable trays also make it simple to clean and take the food out when it's ready. The best part of this is that the tray at the bottom picks up all of the garbage and then it makes cleaning it a lot simpler. 100% recommend!!!",
