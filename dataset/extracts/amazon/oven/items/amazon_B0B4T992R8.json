It arrived a few days ahead of schedule. It seems to work very well - cooked a turkey dog from completely frozen to done in less than 8 minutes. Air fry mode worked great when I made some french fries.The dials seem straightforward though I\u2019m still getting used to them. Very pleased with this purchase plus the price is right.",

It bakes, makes toast and can be used as an air fryer so I far I\u2019ve used all the features and it\u2019s holding up well. I guess I well need to allow some time to see if any issues pop up but for the money it\u2019s a great deal and I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "So, obviously, this brand is known for its excellent quality appliances. Knowing that, I almost feel bad criticizing this product at all. It's overall really great. However, there are a couple things I don't like.First, there are hot and cold spots inside the oven. The left side gets food more brown and crispy than the right side. That is really irritating for a product that is supposed to be really high quality. Also, the air fry setting and the bake setting are basically the same. There's not any way to activate the \"air frying\" setting at a lower temperature than the absolute max. Yet the instructions indicate various temperatures that can be used when air frying. If I set it lower than the max setting, it is on the bake setting and not the air fryer setting. The two sound very different so it is obvious. I'm not sure what the deal is with that.Everything else about this is great, though. The toaster works, the timer works, it is easy to clean, and it is one of my go-to kitchen appliances for everything from heating up chicken nuggets to cooking sausages and bacon. I think it seems more like a really fancy and big toaster oven than a real air fryer, though.",
