I like they can be cut to size and are big enough for my big air fryer. I gave 4 stars because they stain are can be difficult to clean all the oils off of them. They do not protect the basket completely as they do have holes in them which is necessary for the hot air to circulate. They are thin and fit well into the basket after trimming. I use my air fryer every day and they have not diminished with use. I recommend these if you would like to save tossing the paper ones after each use.",
