                "reviewText": "I bought this as a replacement for my old B&D toaster oven - which I had for over 25 years. Hopefully, this one will last that long too. The old toaster over had one lever for toasting. Press it down and it toasts for a few minutes, then turns off. With the new one, you first have to turn one dial to \"toast\", then turn another dial past \"10\" (much longer than needed for toasting bread, bagels, etc.) to activate the timer. You then have to adjust the time so the items won't burn, or watch it to ensure burning doesn't occur - all while listening to an annoying ticking sound which is constant until the toasting is finished. There's a bell that \"dings\" when the toasting is done. It's kinda loud - not sure if I like that, but I guess some will find it useful.The tray in the old toaster oven had a handle like protrusion on one side. The new tray, although larger, does not. This makes it harder to grasp the tray using an oven mitt or kitchen towel, without touching the food.These gripes aside, it works well. I'd probably choose something else in the future though.",

                "reviewText": "I have a similar toaster oven that I use at home (another brand) but I wanted a new one for an upcoming road trip. This is the only one on amazon that could be delivered overnight! Easy to use and glad it worked, as I just took it, box and all, on the trip. It is used when traveling, mainly to heat up already cooked food but I have since actually cooked food as well. Didn't realize it was also an air-fryer. Haven't tried that function yet. Overall, perfect size, good value. Recommend!",
