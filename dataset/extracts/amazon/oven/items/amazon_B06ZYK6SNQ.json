Dehydrating, however, I can dehydrate effectively on any rack. It is worth it to have extra racks to have another 2 racks of fries ready to go in when the other 2 are done, though.I heard that there is a finish on the rail bars thagoes away over time. I tried taking a razor to one and cutting the finish, and indeed it is not a solid piece of metal, but metal with a shiny finish on it. So it may not be buy it for life quality, which is unfortunate. These will flake off over time just with the heating and cooling of the metal much like teflon would. How long that'll I can't be certain. The wire on it, though appears to be solid, so at least when does happen it'll still be usable.",

I particularly like the light inside and the option to turn it on at any time. Also the air fryer cooks fabulously. Like that a 9 x 13 pan can be used as well as muffin tray. Bakes very well.Also like adding more trays and that the dehydrator can be used well. Think a whole chicken and a roast spatters too much so clean up is time consuming. Would use my self clean oven for that. The Breville toaster oven and air fryer is a wonderful addition to my kitchen. I have used it daily and am completely satisfied with the options it presents.",

                "reviewText": "These are excellent. There are no issues with them.What I do have issue with is Breville's ridiculous pricing / availability, which I consider a bit of a scam. If you go to their website, one of these is $19. Three of them is $70. So they charge you $10 more than if you bought three individually. So, why would anyone buy a pack of three instead of 3 individual ones? Because the individual ones are always out of stock.Breville's decision to run their business like this is frustrating. I love the oven, but I do not trust and do not like Breville because of this one decision some jerk made in the head office.These baskets are exactly what you think they are because one came with your oven. The pricing scam is annoying as hell.",

                "reviewText": "Perfectly fits my Brevelle Air Fryer Pro (BOV900BSS1BCA1).I bought these additional racks to airfry 2-3 items at the same time for meal-prep.These racks really are stainless steel and are well built, they do not bend/flex even after being heat-cycled.Given that the racks use a diamond-mesh basket design, oil, gunk and residue gets trapped into the mesh.This makes it somewhat difficult to clean. However a pipe-cleaner brush or water-bottle cleaning brush does the trick.I recommend buying these when they go on sale since they're a bit pricey.",
