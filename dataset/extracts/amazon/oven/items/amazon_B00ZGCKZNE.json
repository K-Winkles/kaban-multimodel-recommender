                "reviewText": "I purchased the DASH Clear View Toaster and it has quickly become a staple in my kitchen. This toaster is not only aesthetically pleasing with its modern design but also highly functional. The extra-wide slots are perfect for bagels and other specialty breads, which is a major plus for our family as we enjoy a variety of bread. The see-through window is a genius feature that allows me to monitor my toast, ensuring it's toasted to my liking every time.The 7-level browning control provides a good range of toasting options, from lightly toasted to crispy, catering to different family members' preferences. I also appreciate the one-button defrost, bagel, and reheat functions which make it convenient to use. The slide-out crumb tray has made cleaning a breeze and the auto-shut off feature is great for safety, especially on busy mornings when I'm in a hurry.The toaster has a power consumption of 1100 W which means it toasts quickly, saving me time in the morning. I've received compliments on how this toaster looks and functions, and it definitely stands out on my kitchen counter.My only minor gripe is that not all bread types toast at the same pace due to their different densities, but with a little trial and error, I've managed to find the perfect setting for all my toasting needs. I would highly recommend the DASH Clear View Toaster to anyone looking for a stylish and effective toaster that delivers on its promises. It's definitely a great bang for your buck!The DASH Clear View Toaster has received favorable reviews on various platforms including Amazon and Walmart, with customers appreciating its functionality, aesthetics, and the unique see-through window feature that allows monitoring of the toasting process. Users have also mentioned the convenience of having extra-wide slots for different bread types and the ease of cleaning due to the slide-out crumb tray. Overall, it's considered a great value for the price",

                "reviewText": "Let\u2019s be real, we are talking about a toaster, a TOASTER! Why should anyone want to write a review of the most used and easiest to forget ancillary appliance you own? Because the Dash Clear View Toaster is that awesome!The short of it; don\u2019t waste your time looking for anything else. This toaster can handle anything you throw at it with golden brown perfection, quickly. The Dash Clear View Toaster is the best bang for your buck, hands down!The long of it. We are a \u201csomewhat\u201d healthy eating family. We run the gambit when it comes to bread choices. Hardly ever white, mostly wheat for the kids, and tapioca and/or rice bread for the adults. Not all breads toast to perfection at the same rate. Each one of these breads has a very specific heat tolerance that can make for difficult toasting times. And that\u2019s where the window really comes in handy.With the Dash Clear View Toaster you can sit back and enjoy the toasting experience all while watching the progress through its\u2019 front window. Gone are the days of premature toast ejection just to check on the \u201cdoneness\u201d of a specific bread only to have to reinsert the payload back into the heated bay. Visible perfection each and every time.With the white or Tapioca bread, which toast rather quickly, a quick turn to 4 gives us the perfect amount of crunch. The wheat bread takes slightly longer, about a 5 to a 5.5 max. And then there is the ALWAYS FROZEN rice bread. This beast of a bread (Food for Life brand) is twice toasted. Once as a 7 with \u201cdefrost\u201d selected and a second plunge at a 7 without the \u201cdefrost\u201d selected. AMAZING!The controls are easy to understand, clearly marked and simple to operate. Plug it in, place the toast in the slot provided, push down the plunger and away you go. It takes a matter of a use or two to figure out the proper settings to your liking.The \u201cdefrost\u201d feature just doubles the time on the dial. The \u201cbagel\u201d feature only toasts on one side. With some sandwich breads like rye / pumpernickel etc. that have a tendency to toast really well and tear-up the roof of your mouth I like to use the bagel setting. Put the toasted side to the inside (meat side) and the soft untoasted side to the outside, you get the crunch without tearing up the roof of your mouth. AWESOMNESS!I have yet to use the \u201cre-heat\u201d feature \u2026 so you are on your own with that one. Sorry Charlie.As far as the toast rocketing from the toaster with the velocity of an unladen swallow, African or Eurpean \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter, I have found that to be inconsequential. Does it pop up and sometime flop out on its own? Yes, rarely. But that has happened with my old toaster as well (a re-gifted 2 slice Panasonic that we got as a wedding gift 22 years ago). So really I kind of like the nostalgia of it when it does happen. BONUS! Let\u2019s just hope that I get 22 years out of this amazing beast.So in conclusion, I just wrote an essay on a toaster. What the hell am I thinking?! Yes, it is that great. Click the \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d button and get the Dash Clear View Toaster. You will not regret yourself for doing so, unlike your college spring break weekend. Love you son!",
