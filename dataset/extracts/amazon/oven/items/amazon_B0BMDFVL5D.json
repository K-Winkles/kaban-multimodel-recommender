                "reviewText": "It has now been a year. This oven is heavily used daily. 3 teenagers baking frozen foodsand I use it almost daily to make dinner. The temp no longer reaches 450\u2070 but it holds at about 380\u2070 which works just fine. I am still happy with it.Was delivered yesterday so cannot attest to longevity. But Love this oven. I replaced another that never worked right. For reference we are a house of 5 with 3 being teenagers. So in 24 hrs this little oven has seen a lot of use.Pros. Easily fits a 13x9 cassarole pan. Gets HOT fast. First thing I tested was temp. Set to 350\u2070 my prone read and held 368\u2070. At 450\u2070 held 488\u2070. Possibly high due to probe being very close to racks but higher for my liking is better anyway.Top and sides do get hot to the touch. My kids act as if it is on fire. It is not but it dies get hot to the touch. I can touch it briefly. Under cabinet got warm on the bottom but nothing concerning.Convection works well. Hoping to airfry soon. Have not tested rotisserie.Doirs open on both sides. Read Cons for tip on thisCONS-BE VERY CAREFUL REMOVING FOID. The racks are weak. And will cave if pulled out. This is an easy fix. Only pull the rack out about 1 inch to hold doors open then use oven cgloces to remove food. Problem solved with ZERO burnsThis will be hard to clean. I know because my last one was same design. But it is a damn oven they are never easy to clean.No always on feature. Frankly, my last had this feature I used it once to see it work. Necer used it again in 3 yrs. If more time us needed jyst turn the dial.All in all uf this little guy lasts 2 yrs or more I will be absolutely estatic. Well worth the price for that length of time. Fingers crossed",

                "reviewText": "We've had some small toaster ovens the last couple of years and were having to cut a pizza in half just to cook one for the two of us; it's so nice to have a countertop oven that we can cook for two and more in! I love the simplicity of this thing - you know how there are so many preset buttons on everything now, it can be confusing and just unnecessary. I almost always use the same setting and amount of time for most of what we cook anyway. Of course, with every new gadget you get, you've got to learn all about it, and this was easy and quick to get the hang of.There is one rack and one tray, but as the picture shows, you can use them both for cooking a bunch at once. Because it's big enough to reach in, it's easy to clean inside. It has cooked all our food evenly so far, but our experience has been once you have a small oven for about a year and a half, things begin to not cook as well. That's why it's nice that this one doesn't cost so much since I already figure I'll be getting a new one after that long, but who knows - maybe this one will last longer than that before it starts declining.I do love the look of it, it's just kind of fascinating to see it on our counter! Some cons to note: the doors open together, so I'm always surprised when I reach for one door and the other opens too - don't stand too close while you open it thinking just one side will open or you might get hit by the other ... LOL ... Also, as we all know, the metal parts are going to get very hot and I always watch out for that, but there's a tiny metal piece at the inside top of the glass door that I didn't see. Once I brushed past that as I opened the door and got slightly burned - just enough to hurt a little while but not blister or anything, so watch out for that. And last of all my cons, as one reviewer mentioned (and I'm glad she did) the rack will tip backward when you pull it out and you could get burned or possibly have all your food slide backward and have a mess. This happens because the bumps or whatever you call them on the sides of the oven that hold the rack have a significant gap between the front and back; when the rack reaches that gap, there's nothing holding it up except the front one, so that makes it tilt backward.But I've already told my friends I love this thing and I definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I debated between this toaster oven and two others that cost 3 and 4x more. For just under $80, I feel that I made the right choice :) I\u2019m happy with it. I use it a few times a month and really only cook salmon, green veggies, and butternut squash or sweets potatoes, with the occasional frozen pizza and toast from time to time and I have zero complaints. The only thing that would improve this item for me was if it came with an extra pan, but I think all toaster ovens typically only come with one. You should note that the double doors, the sides, and recently, even the knobs on the control panel get very hot! I\u2019ve burned myself two or three times already with this toaster oven an even though I try to be careful.",

I have a separate oven thermometer inside as a check. As long as you are aware of that and keep an eye on whatever you are cooking it's a great deal for the price. I have noticed that the convection fan does scorch food on the right side of the over, nearest to the fan but I remedied that by rotating the pan. The dials are a little hard to see, the numbers on the thermostats are small. This on takes a little getting used to.",
