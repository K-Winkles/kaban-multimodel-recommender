                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t cook at all but finally broke down and bought this. It has a smaller footprint than the newer model which mattered more to me. I use it to toast bagels, roast broccoli, and air fry tofu. It heats up quickly, and everything tastes great. It does take about double the time to cook as a standard air fryer, but I love having a large flat basket to use. It\u2019s easy to fit a lot in 1 layer and honestly the difference between 8 min and 16 min doesn\u2019t mean much to me. I\u2019m just happy at how quickly it preheats and how simple it is to use.",

I guess if you have an actual toaster this would be a nice little unit but I have a tiny kitchen and probably should have sprung for a higher end device.",
