                "reviewText": "Having used this product multiple times a day, nearly every day, since Jul 2022, I can easily say this is the most important kitchen appliance I have. It has saved me SO much time and made cooking fun again. It took some trial and error to understand that all the cooking times would be much less and that often the temperature had to be dropped by at least 25 degrees due to the constant convection (low on bake function). My only complaint is that it's just not easy to clean, not even a little bit, especially if you've air fried some really juicy beef or wings. Cleaning with vinegar (as the maker recommends) doesn't remove the baked on grease. The most luck I had was using a steam cleaner to melt off some of the gunk from the many nooks and crannies. BUT! Frozen pizzas and wings often cook perfectly in half the amount of time it would take in a traditional oven. You can make a small batch of cookies in no time and most small bakeware fits just fine. The rotisserie chicken function really works and it makes decent toast (but it takes at least five minutes). It really shines as an air fryer and oven and almost made me think we could let go of our microwave too as it even reheats leftovers very well. Wouldn't want to live without it!",

                "reviewText": "Instant Pot has done it again! Made my life easier and more fun in the kitchen! Intuitive and and easy to use but comes with great set of instructions for a good quick start or if you have questions about any of the functions. Love the Digital Touch interface and size of cooking space inside oven with great tray, rack and basket. And MUCH more useful than my old basket air fryer since you can toast or broil as well in the Omniplus without the item like a rice cake or piece of toast banging around with the convection hot air blowing! So far easy to clean but haven\u2019t tried to do rotisserie chicken or pork roast in it yet which could be messier\u2026but I don\u2019t think it will be a problem as long as you wipe down the racks and trays after each use as recommended. This Omniplus does not take up that much more real estate on my counter than the smaller Vortex one that I considered with less functionality so I highly recommend spending a few extra dollars If you need to combine your appliances into one instead of also having a toaster, dehydrator etc). It\u2019s a sleek and good looking appliance also! As far as the noise it makes, it\u2019s an air fryer, it blows air like a convection oven so you can\u2019t expect it to be super quiet but it\u2019s not annoying and it does have little beeps to let you know when to rotate or turn your food or when preheat is done for baking or when your item is finished. The blower will continue for a bit to cool off your oven. This is perfectly normal. I looked at many of these ovens online before purchasing And kept coming back to this one , not only because of the reviews but because I am so impressed with my Instant Pot that I use all the time. You won\u2019t be disappointed in this purchase!!",

Only problem found so far is that it beeps for just about anything. Not a real bother as the beeping is low volume. Accessories are nicely made and easy to use. Door fits good and keeps the heat in, which is a problem on some other units. The outside does get fairly hot, so placement needs to be considered.",

                "reviewText": "Toaster oven and air fryer all in one go. Cleaning it is a bit troublesome as it's a tight fit in some spots, but worth the hassle. There are no cool spots inside so you don't have to worry about uneven cooking. Rotisserie is a massive bonus and is great for doing pork tenderloins or tossing your fries into the basket attachment for it if you opt to buy one.",

                "reviewText": "I do love using my Omni Plus 10-in-1 Air Fryer combo oven, I've used it several times since it arrived November 27, 2021. Update on my problem with the rack. I contacted customer care and shared the problem I was having with the wire rack, customer care responded immediately and offered to send me a new rack, the rack arrived and is ever so slightly wider than the original one, it slides smoothly and fits perfectly, I've tested it with a heavy pyrex baking dish and there is no sign of it wanting to fall. I am now changing my stars to 5 stars. Happy with my oven, its features, and Instant's customer service. Original post: \"The problem I'm having is the wire rack wants to fall on one side when sliding it out to remove the food, whether the food is on a small tray or in the air fryer basket. When this happens it will often cause me to get burned on a finger, right now I have two spots healing from recent burns. I do try to be careful and slide the rack out slowly, but this doesn't always help. I wouldn't want to use any type of cooking pan or dish that is heavy as I'm sure the rack would fall.\" Otherwise, I like the way it cooks the food and would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the rack falling with hot food on it. I will continue to use my Omni Plus Air-Fryer Oven as it's easy to use, heats up quicker than my full-size convection oven and clean-up is a breeze.",

                "reviewText": "We are happy with this. It is easy to use and cooks the food well. I don't really have many expectations for an oven beyond that, so I'm happy. The cons are that it beeps for everything. Make sure you mute it unless you don't mind a million beeps. The temperature control can also be a bit finicky. It's tough to adjust just a few degrees because it will then switch to increments of 10. Not a big deal and you will get used to it. The other problem is that our 1st unit developed a problem with the fan. It would sound like a buzz saw. However, customer service was quick and easy to work with and replaced the unit.",

                "reviewText": "I had an 8 year old table top Moulinex convection oven that was getting long in the tooth and wasting energy due to poor insulation.This beauty has a reasonably well sealed door and works much faster than I expected. Be careful the first few times you use this oven as the cooking times will surprise you.Using it is quite straight forward and the display is excellent. As I am a hands on cook I seldom use presets with my appliances so I can't really comment on that but the operation and quality of the end result is well worth the cost of this little guy. I got mine on a deal for about $300 but knowing how well this works I would pay more than that today.Air-frying is really fast - you must be careful as you can easily cremate food before you expect it.BTW - the best hot dog next to deep fried can be made with this product - in much less time than you would expect.Cleaning it isn't all that easy, but I've found that cranking it up on air fry will get rid of most of the interior build-up.The Instant people provide recipes and support and the operation of the oven is easy-peasy . . . as long as you RTFB.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - and my power bill has gone down $15 a month as I almost never use my full size oven any longer.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this for $250 CAD, which was not a sale price but much lower than the price on Instant's website at the time, which was $250 USD.The oven is quite large on the outside, about the size of a typical microwave but taller (roughly 16 inches W x 14\" H x 14\" D). The manual says you should leave 5 inches of clearance above the unit, which I think should not be ignored since it does throw out quite a bit of heat from the top.I have been very pleased with customer support. I didn't find the rotisserie spit in the box, which could be my own carelessness, not sure. They immediately sent me a replacement, no questions asked. I've been waiting until it arrived to make this review because I was curious to see how the rotisserie function worked.I was able to rotisserie a 1.5 kg chicken with no issues, and the result was incredible. Cleanup is a bit annoying since it can be hard to wipe down some of the inside parts near the elements. Overall very impressed. Other functions also work very well.The biggest concerns are 1) it always spends the same ~5 minutes preheating when you start it up, and you will have to re-\"start it up\" if you want to change any of the settings, such as temperature, cooking time, or function, after you started it initially. This makes it hard if you're working with a vague recipe with an uncertain amount of time. 2) the toast function releases a little bit of smoke when you open it up, which can be alarming.Very happy with my purchase. It has replaced my regular oven for most things. I would note that while a 12\" pizza will just barely fit inside, a pizza stone for that size will just barely not fit.",

The Omni is bigger than the Vortex Plus, so serves more people, and is a true convection oven with top as well as bottom heating elements. We didn't hesitate when the price dropped to approx $270 during Prime Day. It was delivered quickly and more than meets our expectations. It cooks a lot quicker than a conventional oven and is more economical in terms of electricity consumption. It is also healthier to airfry than to deep fry. We rarely ever use the big oven anymore. No need. We love the Omni Plus Airfryer! Appreciate the great support of the customer service provided as well, including tips and inquiries, as well as online IP community involvement and recipes. Great company!",
