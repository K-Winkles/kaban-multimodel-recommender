                "reviewText": "For around 40 bucks you can\u2019t beat this little work horse. I\u2019ve had Black & Decker toaster ovens over the years and they never wear out, but eventually get a little worse for wear cosmetically. I like the stainless steel construction of this one. My last one was similar but had a black body and steel face. Let\u2019s break down the pros and cons, shall we?PROSLooks nice. Fits in to a nice kitchen even if it\u2019s not a so-called high end brand.It works! This baby gets nice and hot. My last one (an Oster, yes I had a brief affair with another toaster oven and I\u2019m not proud of it ) left fish sticks mushy. I don\u2019t think it got hot enough. Now they are crunchy on the outside and flaky in the inside.Makes good toast. Just make sure you don\u2019t walk away. It happens fast. Use the lightest setting.The removable crumb tray helps keep it clean and will make it last longer.The rack is a cool design. The provided cooking tray doubles as a drip tray as it slides in in the bottom. This means you could broil a steak or something directly on the rack and catch the fat drippings. Seems a bit messy to me, but it\u2019s a thing you can do.Nice and compact. Careful where you put it, though. It gets HOT!Well constructed.Bakes, brooks, roasts, and reheats like a champ.CONSOutside gets super hot. Keep your kids away from the outside surfaces. I\u2019m certain you can fry an egg on the top while it\u2019s on. Haven\u2019t tried, but it gets really hot. Be careful where you store it. I keep mine on top of the microwave and nothing over it.The baking sheet is nice, but since it doubles as a drip pan that fits into the underside of the wire rack, it\u2019s a bit small. Investing in a slightly larger one will allow you to fit a few more fish sticks.It smells funny the first time you run it. They all do though. Just run it for 30 minutes on the highest setting and wash the tray, rack and crumb catcher with soap first and you\u2019ll be good to go.That\u2019s it! I will update if things change, but if this review stays like this, I\u2019m still happy.Happy toaster ovening!",

                "reviewText": "I've owned about 6-8 of these over the years, getting about 4 years of life from each, wearing them out completely with the last one's bottom heating element breaking apart. So, I kinda like them to begin with and find I've gotten my money's worth on each unit.This unit is very clean looking, looks nice on the countertop and cooks very fast (of course, I may have gotten used to the old one not being so efficient after many years). I have to use the toaster setting on low, because when it heats up, it toasts quickly and will burn if not careful. It heats evenly, does good work with a variety of items i.e. toast, bagels, tortillas, chicken nuggets/strips, fish sticks and other assorted goods. It puts out heat, exterior gets warm, but doesn't burn, unless you are dumb enuf to keep your hand on it.Negatives:*Has a curved glass door, which is elegant, but the handle does not reach the counter, instead hovers about an inch above the counter, which I do not care for. I think over time, this design will weaken the door.*They redesigned the crumb tray which now lays inside the bottom panel and can easily be removed, WHEN NOT HOT. You'll get burned taking it out by hand when hot. My last model had a separated tray which could be taken out while still warm.*They removed the glass door bracket that pulls the wire rack out a little bit when opening the door. It would also push the wire rack back in too. So now, you open the door and have to manually pull the wire rack out to fully access the Broiler Tray. I would like to see the pull mechanism back in.*Finally, the 3 knobs, even though my last one was the same, seem confusing, and takes some adjusting to, but got the feel for it quickly.In summary, I like this unit, like the way it looks and its efficient performance. Good price on Amazon, and would buy it again. Only 4 Stars because of the negatives, but really consider it a 4.5 Star rating.",

                "reviewText": "We go through toaster ovens at a ridiculous rate, mostly because my husband\u2019s pretty cavalier about what and how he cooks in them. Our last oven, a more expensive brand, was impossible to clean and lasted all of 5 months before I said it needed to go before we ended up with a kitchen fire. This Black & Decker unit was my chosen replacement. Although a little smaller than we probably would prefer (too small to warm dinner plates; next time, measure twice, then order), it is definitely worth every penny and performs like a real keeper. Compared to others, it holds temperature better, toasts more evenly, and most importantly to me, CLEANS up easily (with an easy to slide out crumb tray)! Compared to other brands the controls are a little counter-intuitive, but we adjusted to them quickly. And best: we like its performance so well that hubby\u2019s using great care not to trash it, so it still look great! Would definitely buy again.",
