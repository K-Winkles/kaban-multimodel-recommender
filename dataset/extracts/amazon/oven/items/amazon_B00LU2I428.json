                "reviewText": "Bought this toaster because of it simple mechanical controls, and its extra width, despite poor reviews posted. Yes it is light weight, it gets hot ( it is a oven after all ) but not so hot to be a problem or hazard to life and property as some have claimed. It reaches operating temp in a reasonable amount of time. The dial settings were quite accurate ( temp setting 450f , oven temp. gage 460f) Have no idea how accurate the oven temp gage is, but I think it is accurate enough.Previous to this purchase I bought a different brand toaster oven that cost three times the price, it failed two days after receiving it, that was a waste of my time and money, Yes Amazon did refund money, but it did end up being a less then ideal refund, and it did cost me money. I doubt I will ever shop or buy from Amazon again.",

                "reviewText": "We used the same toaster oven for the first 7 years of our marriage. My husband complained time and time again about how ugly it was getting and that we needed to upgrade. Well, I did that for Father's Day! Now, we use our toaster ovens a lot. Literally on a daily basis. We use it for all of the regular things that you would expect like toast, bagels, frozen prepared meals, pizza, etc. We actually don't have a microwave so we use it to warm up all of our food as well! So it is used for almost every meal of the day.I LOVE the size of this toaster oven and it is just pretty! It is so much more usable than our previous oven and it doesn't take up too much room on our countertop. I have successfully cooked things that I would have only cooked in our larger standard sized ovens previously like casseroles, bread, cookies, etc. It performed just as well as the larger oven. It's also nice not to have to heat up the entire house when I want to cook something. I do have to say that it cooks things more evenly than our previous toaster oven as well.I was specifically looking for a toaster oven with knobs versus a digital display. How many times have I had products with those fancy digital displays break?! Technology is great, but sometimes I just like to go back to the basics and I mean that in a good way. The knobs are easy to manoeuvre, but I did have a slight challenge making toast the first time. I couldn't quite figure it out. I'm sure that if I would have read the directions better that would have helped though. ;-)Now...drumroll, please...the reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars? The buzzer! That sucker is LOUD. That's great when I want to be notified so that I can remove items from the oven, but when my kids are asleep, I have a migraine, etc then I would love the option to turn it off or lower the volume. That's definitely not a make or break detail and I would still purchase this toaster oven again. Especially for the great price!",

                "reviewText": "I have just received my third oven of this model. The other two lasted about four years each with everyday use. Not just toasting in the morning, but this is my actual oven for cooking. I never use my big oven. I am a baby boomer and I have come to terms with things not lasting like they used to. That being said, this oven has served me well. I got it originally for the wide oven capacity. For the two of us, this is perfect. I have read the other reviews, and yes when it was getting older, I noticed it became loud on the cooking part, not the toaster. And then finally the oven part went, and only the toaster worked. But I didn't care if it played a tune while it cooked, I still liked it. No glass ever shattered, and I didn't notice the temperature being subpar either. It cooked chicken, pork, casseroles, everything, or I would not have gotten a third one. For the most part I was quite pleased with it. I noticed they now have a newer version with a air fry option. Nope, I know better. I just stuck with what worked. I don't need any fancy add ons. Just one more thing to break. My guess is it doesn't air fry like a dedicated air fryer anyway. One more thing, I gave it one star because the grate cleans ok and the tray, which I cover with foil anyway. I stopped trying to clean the cavity of a toaster oven long ago, so no. Never bothered. I just bought new. So there you have it.UPDATE: I like honest reviews so I am going to put this here. Having had my new oven for several weeks now, I notice the cooking/baking selection makes a loud noise. Annoyingly loud. My other ones did when they were on the way out. This one is new and it is making the noise. The toaster, broil selections are quiet. Just the low sound of a ticking timer. Needless to say, after this one, I am going to try to find something else. It is too bad because I loved the width of this one. But I cannot listen to this oven. I have to put the TV on louder since my kitchen/family room is one area. I will not stop using it, but to say it is annoying is an understatement. So if this seems like something you can stand, go ahead. The oven cooks quickly, is wide and I like everything else about it. But it WILL be my last because of the noise. Color me disappointed.",

The transformer supplied is not working . I made a complaint to Black & Decker who sent a technician and he rectified the transformer on his second visit . Within the first use , the main MCB tripped indicating overload or short circuit in the transformer . Black & Decker refuses to service / replace the transformer saying it\u2019s not their product . It\u2019s just been a month since delivery and issue isn\u2019t getting resolved . Will Amazon come forward to sort out the mess ?",

Con este modelo podemos cocinar 4 o 5 molletes al mismo tiempo (depende del tama\u00f1o del pan) y as\u00ed servir la cena o el desayuno a todos juntos y no tener que hacerlo por turnos. Es conveniente que cuenta con dos selectores uno para el horno y otro para el tostador, y en ambos casos las indicaciones son claras y f\u00e1ciles de interpretar. Lo \u00fanico en lo que hay que tener cuidado es su tama\u00f1o, ya que si no se tiene el espacio suficiente en la cocina, puede resultar estorboso.",
