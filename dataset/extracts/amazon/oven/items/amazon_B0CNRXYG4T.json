                "reviewText": "As a family that cherishes homemade pizza nights, we found ourselves constantly struggling with achieving that perfect crust in a conventional oven. That's when we decided to purchase the Slice Box Electric Pizza Oven.The product arrived in a robust 44-pound package, ensuring everything was intact. The box contained the Electric Pizza Oven, a pizza stone, an oven door, a pizza peel, a laser thermometer, an outdoor cover, a recipe booklet, and a user manual. The oven itself required no assembly, while the pizza peel and oven door needed minimal setup\u2014attaching the handles, which took no more than five minutes using the included tools.The Slice Box boasts a user-friendly design with two control knobs for the top heating element and the bottom element that heats the pizza stone. We appreciated the simplicity of this design, making it approachable even for beginners.Heating up to the recommended 675\u00b0F took around 20 minutes, easily monitored with the provided laser thermometer. Our first experiment was a frozen pizza which came out crispy and perfect in about 5 minutes. Following this, we cooked frozen soft pretzels that were ready in 2-3 minutes. We then proceeded to make our own pizzas, ranging from classic pepperoni and cheese to large supreme variations. Each pizza cooked beautifully within 5-6 minutes, depending on our crust preference. The process was straightforward: remove the oven door, slide in a pizza using the peel, replace the door, and then simply wait a few minutes before removing the pizza. The ease of use was remarkable.The Slice Box operates silently and cleaning up after use is a breeze. Its compact size allowed us to use it on the same table where we dined, adding to its convenience.Overall, the Slice Box Electric Pizza Oven has been a delightful addition to our kitchen appliances. Its ease of use, efficiency in cooking, and the quality of the pizzas produced make it a worthy investment. The only thing that might stop me from using this oven regularly is the unlikely event of growing tired of delicious homemade pizza. Highly recommended for anyone venturing into the world of home pizza making!",
