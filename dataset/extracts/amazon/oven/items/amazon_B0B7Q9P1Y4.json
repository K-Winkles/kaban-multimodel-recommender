                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Smart Oven",
                "reviewText": "This is an excellent smart oven with a lot of control. There are very quick and easy settings, and those settings can be modified giving great control over its operation. Custom settings can also be saved for making common tasks accomplished with the push of a button. Just take the time to learn to use the oven and you will be rewarded.I wanted to address some things people may be curious about that isn\u2019t clear about this oven from the listing. The oven does have a bump out for the main 5 in convection fan in the back. I\u2019ve included a photo of the bump out and the flush mount cord, which is appreciated.The oven does get hot on the outside, but within 1\u201d from the left and right sides, the air temp is only a few degrees higher than ambient room temp and with my baker\u2019s hands, I can touch the metal sides without burning, though it is certainly hot. The top radiates heat the most as would be expected. Cooking at 450F the air temp 4\u201d above the oven was approximately 125F degrees in a 73F room. The top metal is too hot to touch while in operation. I discovered that the base unit appears to be nearly identical to the Ninja Foodi XL, and I ordered a cutting board with silicon feet for the top that fits perfectly. It was from the Umilife Store and measured 16.3x13.1 and designed to work with DT201 and DT251. The footed cutting board still allows airflow but greatly reduces the heat rising toward my upper cabinets. I highly recommend it.For proofing dough or making yogurt, the large convection fan will not run, but this unit evidently has two fans. Any time the oven is in use, there is a smaller unseen fan that always runs. The large fan can be controlled from 0 to 100% fan speed, but the smaller one cannot be controlled or disabled. For making yogurt that requires 8 to 9 hours or slow cooking, I think the constant small fan running is a slight downside.Preheating can easily be disabled/enabled on the fly as well as saved as a default setting. Also adding additional time or adjusting temperature can be easily done on the fly.The internal light is bright and the food can easily be seen while cooking. This is nice when trying to achieve perfect browning.The unit\u2019s large 5\u201d convection fan is powerful and makes very crispy air fried food. We made fingerling potatoes that had crispy skin and were tender inside. We\u2019ve made fries that are very close to deep fried fries. It makes some of the most perfectly even toast I\u2019ve seen. We also made crispy thick cut bacon on the grill rack using an oven pre-set, and experienced no smoke and almost no grease splatter. The grill pan has two small pour spouts making it easy to pour off grease. After cooking the bacon, the oven was wiped down inside after it cooled and looks brand new. That was a relief.With the door shut and the convention fan on max, it can certainly be heard running, but it isn\u2019t overwhelming. It reminds me of a vent hood sound. When you open the door with the fan running, you realize how well the sound is being dampened. The powerful fan is key to the excellent air frying capabilities.I\u2019ve used the wifi connected app a few times and it works well. Selecting a recipe or preset will automatically set the oven to the proper settings.Someone mentioned the 34 quart capacity as not being correct. I think many of us imagine how many quart mason jars or quarts of milk we could stack in the oven, and it would not hold 34 quart containers. However, a quart is listed as having 57.75 of cubic inch space. And if the oven cavity width x height x depth is calculated, it is around 2000 cubic inch volume, so that matches the 34 qt volume stated and is accurate.This unit also has a clock that can be enabled or disabled. The LEDs are bright and I chose to leave my clock disabled.Right now I give the oven 5 stars. I\u2019ll update periodically with longer term performance and durability. I love that it can replace so many appliances that I use often. I also love that it isn\u2019t wider than my previous smart oven, but it is taller. It actually takes up slightly less room width wise on my countertop.",

It cooks with excellent precision as long as you know what you are doing.this is not a toaster but it will do the job if you adjuste it right. Use preset numbers as starting points( although they are pretty good). I tried the followings:Sea Bass, Salmon , Lamb Chops, Chicken ( breast meet kabab. Wings, drumsticks) \u060c Ground beef kanab, Stakes, focaccia bread, PizzaThey all came out like a high end resturants quality.FYI preheat and rack levels are a key .I also use Amazon Gutham Steel air fryer basket + WILLBBQ 304 Stainless Steel 13.2\" Long Flat Barbecue Skewers from Amazon for kabab",

                "reviewText": "My old air fryer crapped out, and my husband ordered me this giant thing. At first, I was very intimidated. It has endless features and settings, most of which I haven't used. I have only been using it for two months now, so I can't speak to longevity, but I can say that I am satisfied. I actually really like the proofing setting because my house tends to run cold, and I can make baked goods in nearly half the time. It does have a long pre-heat time for the air fryer setting, so I have to plan ahead a bit longer than with my old air fryer. The racks don't fit well in the dishwasher, so I'm stuck handwashing. It has presets for specific meals that are a bit silly, in my opinion, but may be helpful for inexperienced cooks. It does have a light which is nice. This appliance won't be for everyone. If you want a small and quick air fryer, buy something else. It still doesn't hold as much as oven, so it won't always work for family sized meals or sides. I probably wouldn't recommend for the average kitchen, but it does meet my needs and surprised me with the proofing feature.",

                "reviewText": "Have been looking for some time to replace my 22 year old DeLonghi convection oven. After looking and trying a different one (returned), we settled on this Nuwave model and so far are very happy with it. Most important for me:--Contrary to what one or two reviewers said, I find it very easy to use right out of the box if you just want to turn it on and bake, broil or whatever, leaving the factory defaults in place for fan, etc. It is so simple: just turn it on, select bake, if the preset temp of 350 isn't what you need just change it, change time if desired, and hit start. It preheats quickly. Have not tried the various modes, switching the fans, etc. which does get more involved, but certainly is not needed in order to operate the oven. Just depends on how many bells and whistles you want to use--it does have a lot of them!--I like that the light does not automatically turn on all the time while cooking. You can turn the light on and off while cooking or leave it on--up to you. I like saving the bulb. The DeLonghi oven this replaces had the light stay on during the entire cooking time.--The oven is not particularly noisy when running. Also it does not throw off any more heat than my previous oven.--It beeps lightly when the preheat cycle is done. The beep that sounds when it's done preheating and done cooking is gentle, not loud and obnoxious like some appliances.--Have not seen others comment on this, but some countertop ovens have racks that are so wiggly that they actually can slip out of the guides if the dish is heavy, spilling hot food. Both of my previous ovens had this problem so I had to be very careful. The Nuwave oven is not like that: the racks are very sturdy and fit securely in the guides.--The oven accommodates a 9 x13 lasagna type pan as long as it doesn't have handles. That is a must have for me. Would have loved it if they had made it just a few inches wider to accommodate handles. As it is, I use my Wilton cake pan and it fits perfectly.--Love the probe! Have had problems with probes in the past, even in a large Miele wall oven. They often are not reliable. This one is spot on. First thing I cooked was a pork roast with the temperature probe; when it came to the desired temp I used my instant read thermometer to check it and they were identical. It's nice to see the temp rising so you can start to gauge the time you have left to prepare the rest of the meal.--So far I haven't had a problem cleaning it, but can see that if you let it get dirty and greasy it may not be real easy. It's important to wipe it down after use if there is any grease or spills.Overall very happy and would recommend this oven.",
