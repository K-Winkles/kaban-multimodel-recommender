                "reviewText": "We recently purchased a new double oven range and discovered the first time using it that pulling the racks out is a bit tricky. I went in search of a tool that would allow me to more easily to pull the racks out and came across this little gadget. It does pull the rack out... but once it hits the door, then you have to lift it up and over to continue pulling out. You can move the tool to the middle bar to pull the rack out a little farther, but then you're reaching into a HOT oven. The door/rack design is not the fault of this tool though... it's a poor oven design. This tool does help and works *mostly* as intended.It works great to push the rack back into the oven.The smallest cutout doesn't work on the oven at all. It works on my air fryer rack, which is a smaller diameter, but I usually just use the tongs I'm going to use with the food or the rubber oven mitts that came with it to pull the racks out of it.It was fairly inexpensive and it's a nice looking wooden gadget in my kitchen. I just wish it worked a little better with the small top oven in my double oven.",
