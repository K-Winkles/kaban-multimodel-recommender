But adding the extender ring allows me to cook tall casseroles with dinner rolls on top for longer and more thoroughly, and the rolls are done just right now. I also can cook a whole turkey in 2 1/2 hours with juicy meat all done, and a golden brown skin because the ring makes the oven just right for that. Also, the other accessories with the ring are interesting. I have yet to try the air fry basket, but think it will be great for making French fries.",

                "reviewText": "I just got this as an add on to my NuWave oven. I really like the NuWave Primo as is, but this really does give it that little extra to push it completely over the top. The fry basket helps with all things 'fried'. Since is it air fried, the greasy oily taste usually associated with frying is gone. So, the solid flavors of the foods come through more completely.",

                "reviewText": "Since the NuWave Primo Grill oven does not include any accessories, this kit is helpful if you don't already have NuWave oven accessories. This kit includes an extender ring, an air fry basket, a baking pan, and a 3\" cooking rack.The baking pan is the same as supplied with previous NuWave oven models. This pan works well for baking and for dual layer cooking in the oven. I suggest lining this pan with aluminum foil for anything other than baking cakes or baked goods. Baking meats, fish, or anything using oils would damage the finish in the pan. The 3\" rack included is not quite as useful since it is a 3\" rack no matter which way you turn it. It would be more useful if it provided two different heights rather than both the same. The 1\"/3\" rack supplied with previous models is much more useful. The 1\"/3\" rack from older models is a bit large to fit in this oven, but it can be made to work if you place it right in this oven. Personally, I don't care for the stainless extender ring as you can't see the food below it as you can with the clear extender ring. Unfortunately, the older clear extender ring does not fit this oven. I do like the included air fry basket that comes with this kit. It does a good job at air frying frozen french fries which is all that I've used it for so far. The fry basket is large enough that I have eliminated my air fryer.I hope this review was helpful for you, and I will update it if my opinion changes.",
