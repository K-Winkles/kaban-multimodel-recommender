The laser-etched stainless steel hexagonal network of ridges forms peaks over nonstick valleys for increased searing capabilities. Do the handles get hot or are they heat-resistant? Our stay-cool handles are designed specifically to be heat-resistant. However, shorter handles that are closer to the heat will heat up more quickly. So please use caution. And always use oven mitts when removing cookware out of the oven. Is HexClad Hybrid Cookware oven-safe? Yes. Our cookware is oven-safe up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit and our tempered glass lids are oven-safe up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Can I use HexClad Hybrid Cookware on any type of cooktop? You can use HexClad Hybrid Cookware on virtually all household stove tops including gas, electric, glass, and induction cooktops. Can I use metal-utensils with HexClad Hybrid Cookware? Yes, HexClad Cookware is metal utensil safe such as metal spatulas and whisks.",

It was exactly what she wanted. Now she's cooking like a demon, using this thing every chance she gets. It cooks steaks like nothing else. Great sear and crust at high heat. This pan was designed for MEAT. Add some butter and wow. Tender steak. It cleans up very easily with a wipe in the dish water and the cooking finish seems indestructible. Clever design. The ridges keep the coating from getting scratched by keeping the utensils away from the coated surface. Good engineering. The only item that scratches is the LID. Very annoying. That brand new surface has some scratches in it already. UGH. Still, the pan is worth the price, especially for me because I'm the one eating that great food.",

                "reviewText": "I want to sing the praises of this incredible cookware. I started off with the purchase of this pan with lid. I thought the 14 inch pan might be too big but I was wrong. It fits nicely on the stove and can cook anything because of the size. The first thing I noticed was the even heat distribution. I made breaded boneless chicken breasts. In all other pans, even when the oil was hot, there was sticking. Not with this incredible pan. I put the chicken breasts in, let it brown a while and then just jiggled the pan a little. The chicken slid around much to my joy and I had beautifully browned meat that was so easy to turn over. I wish I had known about this cookware 3 years ago because I invested in 3 separate types of pans, all which failed after a year and had to be given away. This cookware is worth every penny you pay for it.The next pan I bought was a large dutch oven with a lid. I made a white sauce first. I've never had a pan like this. As soon as I mixed the melted butter and flour together, the roux bubbled beautifully from one edge of the pan to the other--no hot or cold spots. Perfect roux!My next pan will be the large roaster. Looking forward to that for sure. Every time I cook with these beautifully made quality pans I feel such appreciation for them. Even though the instructions say you can use metal utensils, I still am careful with them. I've never needed to use a metal scrubbie because nothing and I mean nothing sticks....cleaning up is quick and easy. The bottoms of the pans have never developed that golden brown oil build-up like all my other pans have. They wash perfectly clean and look brand-new.",

A lot of cheap cookware today has aluminum. Non stick cookware scratch\u2019s releasing toxins if one doesn\u2019t use correct utensils. . Some research states correlation between aluminum & Alzheimers or Dementia. We must all take better care of ourselves & choose quality over price. Be good to yourself. Downside: There is aluminum in Hexclad but it is sandwiched between other non toxic metals. Therefore, it\u2019s safe & good quality. It\u2019s stated it doesn\u2019t scratch with metal utensils. I don\u2019t know because if you spend this type of $ for quality you\u2019ll use correct utensils & not mess these pots/pans up.",

                "reviewText": "After having a not so great experience purchasing a set of All Clad cookware ($$$$) which for me didn't come close to living up to the hype (too heavy, scratched easily, and handles that dug into the hands when cooking) I decided to try Hexclad and bought this skillet. Now, I've seen Gordon Ramsey touting them on the web and on his TV show-- which actually made me a little suspicious-- but I spent the money and got this pan.HOLY COW.These things really are fantastic. Forget all the hype and just know that you're getting a VERY high quality item. The weight is good, the heat distribution is fantastic, and they have very comfortable handles--especially when compared to All Clad.One review I've read of these says that his eggs slid around \"Like Bambi on ice\"-- and I have to agree.We've used this pan for various things, and nothing stuck. There are some reviews that show eggs sticking all over, which I'm sure is true if you don't use any sort of oil or butter. But if you do, NOTHING seems to stick. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase, and I've ordered a 2 quart saucepan as well, and am budgeting to get one pan a month until I complete my conversion to a HexClad kitchen.I'm very, very pleased--shockingly so, with this product!!!I was literally expecting it to be something cheap-ish, and all TV hype.I'm extremely happy to report that this was not the case. These are the real deal, and work as advertised.",

This is a heavy duty frying pan that can handle being cleaned in the dishwasher and metal utensils being used when cooking with it. It cleans off very easily, I by default always spray or drizzle olive oil on the pan when I cook with it and have had no issues with food sticking to it.",

How dare they at this price point with their super slick (pun intended) marketing campaign.I purchased a hex look alike. Far less money, Returned it because everything stuck. I get this, the real hex, and yep eggs stick. Its best feature is its lovely lid and its pretty just sitting around.The Zwilling Madura pan is faaar superior. Eggs don't stick and it's packaging doesn't contain a warning that eggs will. It is weighty but perhaps that's why it performs so well.",

                "reviewText": "So far so good. I have only had this new brand for about a month using 5 - 6 times a week and absolutely ecstatic about it.I gave up the old non stick brand name so familiar I'd used for years due to health concerns and started a search for a safe durable long term pan. Having first decided on a Granite Stone I got a set which are lightly used and still OK but needed a 12\" so bought one separately. After about 3 weeks it started to stick even after pre seasoning and developed patches where no manner of cleaning methods would work. Discarded it and tried a Gotham Steel 12\" but disappointedly experienced the identical results in about 6 weeks.After weeks of research into every type of pan I could, I bit the bullet for a Hex Clad and so far extremely happy I made the investment as they are not cheap. Quality is worth the investment.Season to directions. I cook low to medium for most dishes with a tiny bit of olive oil and after one month it is just like the first night I used it. Have not needed the dishwasher as a quick two or three swipes with the Scotchguard pad and Dove cleans it totally in about 30 seconds. Hopefully that good progress will continue and the weight and quality of build certainly is up to it's price point.UPDATEStill extremely pleased. Now approaching 3 months of heavy use it literally takes a few seconds with soap and a sponge to come perfectly clean, nothing sticks - best pan I've ever owned!Now 4 months and exactly what I said above at 3 months. So VERY happy with my purchase!",
