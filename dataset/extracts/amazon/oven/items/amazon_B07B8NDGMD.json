                "reviewText": "I purchased the first one of these new. I had it for 2.5 years before I needed to toss it as it was really hard to clean the inside, despite lining the bottom with foil. It just looked really bad. But I loved it so much, that I bought it again, reconditioned, hoping it would be okay. It is.It came with all the parts and manual. I use it to not only toast, but I cook single pieces of chicken, steak, pork chops in it, etc. I also bake. You can cook meat from frozen in this oven. Works very well. But, as a precaution, now I create a foil tent with an opening at the top, and cook the meat that way so that the sides and front won't be splattered with grease. So hopefully, I can make this one stay looking nice and neat for a few years or more.Love it.",
