So easy to clean after use. Made turkey wings in it last night and they came out even better than when I cook them in the stove. Its a bit small but not too bad especially for the price. It fit 4 nice size turkey wings inside with no issues and day before that I cooked 4 large italian sausages again no problem. You cant beat this price! Well worth every penny",

                "reviewText": "The reason I bought the oven is because I do not like to reheat food in the microwave. And using our conventional oven to warm up a slice of pizza took too long. I am also not too sure you can fit 4 toast in there. I do not recommend cooking in this oven, I think it is meant to re-heat some food or toast bread. I have not tried to cook anything big in it because it is small and I think baking a cake, or cooking meat might not be ideal use for this oven. I did try cooking up some fish sticks and fries (frozen) on the drip tray and it worked great, you just have to turn the food half way through cooking. And I also added foil paper to the drip tray to keep it clean. I did try at first adding parchment paper to the tray for the fish and chips ( since I had to do it twice as it only fits very little food in the tray) and the paper burnt!! Need less to say please.......***DO NOT LEAVE OVEN UNATTENDED WHEN IN USE***............. The thing I love about it is that it is small. The oven is light, I keep it on top of my microwave and move it to the counter when I need it. We mainly use it to heat up meat patties, or warm up left over pizza, cook some Frozen fish and chips or melt some cheese on a bagel.....and so far it has done a great job. If I had to complain about anything on this oven, it\u2019s that the knob on the bottom \u201c the timer\u201d is hard to move, and once you set it, you can not go back. So you must choose carefully or if you want you can set another timer separately to let you know when the time is up. Going past the dark toast icon, to the 10, 20 numbers setting is also the same, you can not turn back the knob. Even though the timer may be set for more than you wanted to set it at, don\u2019t worry because once you unplug it, the timer will continue but will shut off eventually!!. The broil setting does just that, and turns the oven only on the top. If you are heating up something that does not drip, do not use the drip pan provided, as the bottom of the food will not heat up as well, just put the food on the rack without the drip pan. ( I put foil paper on the very bottom to help keep it clean) . It is also very easy to clean since we do not cook main dishes in the oven. Overall I am very happy since it is a perfect size for two people.",
