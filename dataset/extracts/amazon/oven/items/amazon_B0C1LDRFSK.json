                "reviewText": "Seems like the heating elements get to glowing very quickly vs my old unit, but maybe all new units do that when new. *dunno*. The interface is much improved over my last toaster oven which was why I justified it. My digital display is a nice bright white LCD. With older units, or my last unit its usually the timer that dies first as mine did because the timer was mechanical -- so then the unit wouldn't always shut off (fire hazard) Hopefully this unit with its buttons, dial, and digital screen will last till my kids are off to college. Did not buy it for 'air frying' so can't speak to that function but the toasting and convection oven seem great.",
