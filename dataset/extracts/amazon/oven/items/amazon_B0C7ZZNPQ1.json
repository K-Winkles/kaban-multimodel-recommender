                "reviewText": "I am adding additional info on this item.It does work well after spending much time figuring out how to operate it and even more time contacting mfg. After using it for quick meals and making toast but not having it on for more than 10 to 12 minutes, I finally roasted a chicken in it. It turned out very well, but something happened to damage the ceramic coating on the bottom black pan. I contacted Amazon and all they could do is have me send it back and they'd give me a refund. All I want is a new black ceramic pan with no defects. For that reason, I am concerned of just how well the walls and top of the inside which are also ceramic will last. Also, I am adding the following in this edited review:In their product info on the warranty, it states: \"We also offer a one-year worry-free refund policy and provide free lifetime customer service. If you encounter any issues with our ovens, please feel free to contact us. We guarantee a response within 24 hours. Trust in TAMARIT, we won't let you down.\"I did contact TAMARIT about the damaged bottom black tray and they didn't respond. So much for their warranty. Guess the old saying of \"words are cheap\" is true with this company. All I want is new black bottom tray. I hope they send a new pan to me so they can save face.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this oven. It's a good size. I used a wine bottle in the pics to give it some size perspective (don't try to cook a wine bottle!). I love the size because it allows us to cook a lot more items. Even though it's pretty large, it's still pretty light, which is great for storing it away when not in use. Not only has it been giving a nice even cook, but it gets things nice and crispy. It's quiet. I like the little handle feature to remove the baking tray. So far, I'm a big fan!",
