For Christmas Eve we made a prime rib. Oh my goodness! It was the best. I've never even tasted a restaurant prime taste this good. For New Year's we're making a beef tenderloin and I can't wait. This is the best cooking investment I've ever made. It's the best. It may be a bit pricey for some but it is so worth it. It was so easy. We seasoned the prime with salt and garlic powder, poked the prongs through the meat, put it on the rotisserie, set the timer and left it alone. It came out medium rare throughout. And, it was just as easy to clean.",

                "reviewText": "My parents gave me an old Ronco rotisserie years ago. I believe it was one of the very early models when they were sold via Infomercials on late night TV. It was one of the best Ronco inventions that was ever sold on those infomercials! The plastic base finally cracked to the point where I couldn't use it anywhere. I had fixed it once, but the glass door would no longer stay on and was unfixable.This is one of those kitchen appliances that you think, \"Do I really need this?\" The first one was given to me so when it couldn't be used any longer I had to make a decision as to whether I should spend $100 to replace it. The answer was 'yes'!This rotisserie makes cooking a chicken so delicious, so juicy and so easy that I couldn't imagine just roasting a chicken in the oven, again. The spits are sharp and easily fit into the chicken and onto the gears which rotate the chicken. There is a rotisserie function or just a rotate function (without heat). My model has a dial to set the temperature (figure 15 min/lb for the chicken). The instructions say that the spits can hold two chickens but the one time I tried two chickens they were too big and didn't rotate properly.I also cooked a boneless beef roast that was around 5lbs and it came out incredible and medium rare. You can also rotisserie a small turkey. I had done that once and it was also amazingly juicy.The product comes with a base on which to put the spits after cooking so you can slice beef, but I have never used it. The pan and pan top (onto which the grease drips) is easy to clean if you line the pan with aluminum foil, first. When my food is finished cooking and I've taken it out of the rotisserie, I clean the rotisserie right away, as it's much easier when everything is hot. As the unit cools down a bit, I take glass cleaner to clean the inside of the glass that usually has grease spatters. The product also comes with rubber/vinyl heatproof gloves to use to remove the spits from the rotisserie after the food is done cooking.I think the original was built a bit better than this, but that's usually the case as years go on, companies design products to be made less expensively.Even with this being slightly less impressive than the original model, I will continue to use on a regular basis. If you like rotisserie chicken from Costco, imagine having the chicken come out JUST as juicy at home with your own concoction of rub ingredients!!",

                "reviewText": "In 2006 I received the older version of this Ronco rotisserie and used it frequently for nearly 13yrs so far as cooking every holiday Turkey, Beef Roast and too many Roasted Chickens to count.All were spectacular, moist juicy and all presented beautifully! Since then I had been unable to reproduce the spectacular results this unit created, thus my new unit arrived a few days ago.I cooked an 8lb Turkey breast to succulent (Basting it with herbed butter early during the cooking process) then apple juice thereafter to succulent perfection. Just to mention I usually place the unit on a small table outside on our deck to save inside counter space and it works nicely. It\u2019s simple and easy to use\u201dJust set it and forget it\u201d you tube has helpful videos for first time users.The clean up can be a be detailed, unlike my last unit this one has a \u201cdetachable heat shield\u201d this really helps with clean up. I covered mine with foil along with the bottom of drip pan. Front glass is detachable and was easily cleaned with Dawn Detergent and a Scrub Daddy. Same for the inside. I am planning to have this model for many years. Yes as some reviewers mentioned it does turn more slowly, the meat was still incredibly moist!It is a big large to store. I saw more compact models available but decided to stick with the original sized unit.I must confess this is my success for rave Turkey and meat reviews from our family and friends.Give it a try.",
