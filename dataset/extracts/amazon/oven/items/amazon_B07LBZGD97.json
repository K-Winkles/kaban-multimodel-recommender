                "reviewText": "One week ago, I bought another brand of air fryer. Everything seemed perfect about it when it arrived but the second time I used it it had an electrical shortage and was dead. I was so disappointed after doing all the research.!!! my sister and I bought the same air fryer and she ended up returning hers too afraid that it would have an electrical short like mine. When the gowise arrived, the delivery person left it on the stairs 2/3 of the way from the front door. The box and unit weighed 32 pounds. It was a challenge to roll that box up the stairs, but I was determined because I had no choice -the other air fryer was so light, I could carry it up the stairs in the box by myself. So I approached this air fryer with much trepidation I like the gowise brand. I'm actually replacing a Gowise air fryer that I really loved for three years. When I finally had the energy to unbox the air fryer and install it I felt hopeful. First it's a solid machine well-made and impressive. It comes with a generous amount of accessories. I've read reviews criticizing the beeping and it's true. There is a lot of beeping when selecting the correct time and temperature. A knob to control the digital temperature and timer would be an improvement. Other than that it's a spectacular machine. I was surprised to find that the first thing that we fell in love with was lightly toasting tortillas to eat them as chips they were so light and so perfectly toasted. It was amazing, I was able to note the time and temperature to be created again and again 360\u00b0 for three minutes! We made onion rings and apple crisp pie and heated up meat pies. Everything was delicious and perfectly heated. I'm excited to discover what else I will be making , I've had an air fryer for the last four years and normally use it just for quick heat ups and fries and finishing ribs out of the oven. But I assure you that the options this model will give you will expand the things I will be able to create in the kitchen , I'm looking forward to having my cousin over for dinner for kebabs and roasted potatoes. I know it's going to be wonderful but my favorite thing to make in the air fryer is hashbrowns. I zap whole potatoes in the microwave for four minutes. Then I cut and toss them with oil and seasonings air fry them on french fry setting and it's perfect every time you have to try it!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace my Philips XL Air Fryer that I accidentally killed by making a terrible mistake: I put it on the stove under the hood, and bumped the burner knob. The bottom was melted and the machine had to be taken out of service. But this GoWise was everything beyond my wildest dreams!I first saw the oven style GoWise used by Lori Shaw, whom I follow because of RP Strength. She highly recommended this Air fryer and the GoWise brand. What caught my eye was that it was like an oven. With my Philips Air Fryer, I hated fiddling with the basket drawer to take food in and out. I had a hard time cleaning the parts. I felt limited by the design.With this GoWise unit, I get the convenience of the oven door. I don\u2019t have uneven heating as indicated by another reviewer. I love that there are multiple shelves and accessories that come with this unit so I can cook more food at one time, as well as cook them more evenly with the rotisserie feature and rotating accessories.The operation is pretty easy. We use the presets sometimes, but if there are \u201cconventional oven\u201d directions for the frozen food we are cooking, we will adjust the presets to the recommended time and temperature. The beeping of the unit doesn\u2019t bother me; I think the presets are great if you don\u2019t have instructions for a food item and I like that I have a way to know I pressed the buttons properly.This unit is the perfect size for my family of four. I love that we can cook corn on the cob for all of us at once, get evenly cooked tater tots and fries, and have so many ways to cook our favorite foods. I love that the unit turns itself off and has a fan built in to dissipate the heat.I think the only thing I don\u2019t like is the light. The light source is only on one side and only comes on when the unit is on. I can see the food okay when the light is on and the door window is clean, but when the window is dirty or I\u2019m cooking a lot of food, the light isn\u2019t enough to know how the food is cooking. It\u2019s not a big deal since I tend to open the door and check / flip food when I\u2019m not using the rotisserie feature. Another minor thing is finding space to store all the accessories. I use them all, but there are a lot of them. I put them in my electric oven which is pretty much only used for storage or large volume baking these days, anyway.The instruction manual is pretty straightforward and the unit came with a cookbook. I was saddened that I couldn\u2019t purchase directly from the GoWise website and was directed to Amazon due to shipping. I originally wanted a white unit and it was not available to ship to me in that color from GoWise and some vendors on Amazon. I settled for black. I don\u2019t understand why only one color is available to purchase based on where I live. Aside from the oven light, I think this aspect was the most disappointing part of my purchase experience. I love my machine enough to overlook its color; the performance is outstanding. I just can\u2019t overlook the shipping restrictions as a limitation to my options. If you can get it to me, you should be able to get me the color I want. I was willing to pay for shipping despite being a Prime Member to get the color I want but it was not an option from GoWise directly nor some of the vendors here on Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "The packaging was well protected and arrived with no damage. It came with all the accessories, air fryer and dehydrator cook books. I skimmed through the cook books and they seem great. Super simple, feverish ingredients and easy to follow. Definitely got some inspirations from them with my own ideas. I got this air fryer because of the rotisserie and dehydrator functions. I only used it once to reheat leftovers. Worked great with equal temperature all around and done in 5 minutes. Will give updates on the other functionsUpdate 1/19/24- air fryer still works great. But finding some of the quirks. The beeping is obnoxiously loud. I couldn\u2019t find a way to turn off the beeping without taking it apart ( doing this will probably void any \u201cwarranty\u201d ) I found a video on how to take the top off and found the buzzer on a circuit board. I took electrical tape and covered the top of the buzzer. This lowered the volume to a very comfortable level. When cooking with multiple trays, the top one will cook much, much faster than the bottom tray. The tumbler is great for roasting veggies and potatoes. But it very difficult to clean. The last thing I would bring up is the dehydrator setting. You cannot change the temperature ( it stays at 130) but you can change the duration. I got this air fryer to try my hand at dehydrating. And not all my recipes have a temp of 130. You could set it manual and change the temperature but the longest duration is a hour while the process can take anywhere to 4-10 hours. Depending on what you are dehydrating.I would still give this a great rating considering the price. But this company makes a newer version of this airfryer with a second heating unit at the bottom. That probably helps to evenly heat multiple trays. If I didn\u2019t buy this one, I probably would have got the newer one.",

The controls are easy to use, the unit is not too loud and the food cooks well for everything we have tried, including but not limited to, Rotisserie Chicken, Chicken Breasts and Wings, Roast Pork and Rotisserie Pork, Egg Rolls and other snack and Garlic Cheese Bread. The cavity is slightly larger than other Manufacturer Makes, which allows for a better rotisserie sized chichen, (apprx 4 lb). The Red is quite nice and adds a nice accent colour to thekitchen. The interior cooking space dimensions: 10 1/4 \" Wide x 9 1/2 \" Deep x 7 1/4 high with the tray in place and 7 1/2 without the tray. I recommend this product.",
