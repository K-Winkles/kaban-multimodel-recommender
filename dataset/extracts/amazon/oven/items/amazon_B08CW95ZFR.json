The only negative i can give this is the amazon driver left it on the back steps to my receiving dept (in the actual box, exposing what is inside). And it was raining out. The product didn't get wet but i thought that was irresponsible of the driver to leave it out in the rain.",

Didn't notice at first because I was so excited to finally receive it after waiting a week and a half for delivery, I was sent the wrong product. Waiting another week and a half for the correct one, I immediately opened it to run it and get the new appliance smell out. Which didn't go away after about a dozen uses. What I was really upset about was the metal rack, it's so crooked that when its in the door doesn't close all the way. The box is so big and I already went thru the hassle of waiting three weeks for this thing it's not even worth it to exchange at this point.Pros: it's easy to use. Fits in small spaces and heats quickly.Cons: cooks very unevenly. Rack is mis shaped so the door won't close right. The racks and trays sit too high so things burn easily if you don't flip food quickly.",

                "reviewText": "This HB all purpose toaster/oven provides the perception of a total solution. While it looks good on your counter and appears to be well-constructed, this unit tends to disappoint. Most notably, the \"air fryer\" option.I placed (evenly) about 8 frozen mozzarella sticks in the provided basket. Moved dial to \"air fryer\", dial to maximum heat and rotated dial to left in order for the oven to stay on. The air fryer cooked unevenly: some sticks were getting burned while others were barely beyond frozen. After multiple actions such as re-positioning and taking out the overly cooked sticks, I realized that before I could achieve a crispy result, the sticks would be burned instead. I was left with a tasteless, rubbery and a very unsatisfying result.The HB toaster/over gets even lower marks for simple toasting. It is recommended to use the top option and keep the rack close to the top. OK -- the top surface can achieve a nice browning (don't walk away, keep observing), but underneath, the bread is still well-below finished. Of course, you can take the bread out and flip over the pieces but is that what you might say efficient and expected?You might ask what did I expect from an inexpensive appliance like this one? Well, maybe the idea of having an air fryer to do small portions to a satisfying crispiness is alot to expect. Scratch that option. But, at the bare minimum, bread that toasts evenly to a desired \"brownness\" is not too much to ask.",
