                "reviewText": "Looks good, seems to work okay so far.Those who say the toast function doesn't work, keep reading.I purchased this specifically to fit in my 15\" wide x 14\" tall appliance garage, It sticks out a bit too far to close the garage door, but I plan to use it daily. Hopefully the heat does not discolor the cabinets over time. It does not seem to get super hot on the exterior when in use, but I have not ran it more than 15 minutes at a time so far. Thankfully it doesn't have a super dorky weird-sounding brand name like so many Amazon products, since it is on display in my kitchen.I am happy that it seems to have all mechanical controls, meaning no circuit boards to randomly stop working. I peeked through the vent slots in the back, and no circuit boards could be seen.It has 2 mechanical timers, one timer for the oven/air fry functions and one timer for the toaster function.The construction quality seems decent, stainless finish doesn't have any dents, door opens smoothly, knobs feel smooth and sturdy, seems to heat up fairly quickly. Interior light is manually operated with a button, and light it is bright. I am concerned the bulb will burn out like so many other reviews mention, but right now it seems to work fine. There is no instructions on bulb replacement in the manual.To the reviewers who say the toast function does not work, try this: the toast function on my brand new unit didn't function until I noticed that the temperature knob must be turned fully clockwise to 450 deg F for TOAST/BROIL. It has a mark on the temperature dial at 450 Deg F for \"TOAST/BROIL\", but it is easily overlooked.To use Toast:Set mode knob to TOAST (5 o'clock on the mode knob).Set temperature to max 450 Deg F TOAST (3 o'clock on the temperature knob).Set the right timer knob TOAST TIMER to the desired time ( light, med, dark, or 10 minutes max).Toaster works fine for me if I do the above steps.Hopefully it will keep working for years to come...time will tell.",

There is plenty of room to bake chicken or a pork loin. For the first time last week, I tried to toast a bagel. The toast feature does not work! Simply doesn\u2019t turn on. I reached out to the manufacturer and never heard back. The device is so wonderful, in every other way, but it\u2019s ironic that something advertised, in part, as a toaster oven\u2026doesn\u2019t toast. Had to purchase a small toaster for our occasional bagels. Bummer.",

                "reviewText": "Simple, easy to use controls if you read the instructions. Also very QUIET. Other brands I tried were noisy, and the digital controls were awkward. The presets that different brands give you are mostly what someone else thinks works for them. I mostly ended up by passing the presets and used my own anyway. So far very happy with this purchase. One thing worth mentioning. The warrunty covers shipping back to the manufacture if needed. Also If you like the air fryer I would recommend getting the 3 year extended coverage Amazon offers. The rep told me that if anything goes out ( light, heat elements, fan) the whole unit must be replaced, not just a part. I will be very happy if we get 3 years of life.",

It had a fairly small footprint for something that cooks large items. I just wish I got more than 5 months out of it!Dislikes: Stopped working after 5 months. The exterior and knobs get VERY HOT. This is what may have fried the control panel because this puts out so much heat. It's very tight trying to flip over during a cook. You have to remove the rack entirely to do this.Overall, this would have received 5 stars if it lasted longer. I can't justify anything but one star for a product that only gives you 5 months and you have to throw it away. No warranty, no returns at this point. I'd avoid it this product.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is my first air fryer/toaster oven. Overall I do like the product but we have had a couple of problems. In less than 1 month the light bulb inside stopped working and no I didn't leave it on. In fact I think I only turned it on once or twice. The second thing that happened is the tray inside that is supposed to be dishwasher safe is falling apart. If you look in the video you can see that it is all pitted and the coating is coming off. I filed a claim with the company 17 days ago and have not received any response other than an automated one saying that they have my claim. Very disappointing customer service. One other thing to note is that if you use this like an oven then you need to add time for example if a recipe says 350\u00b0 for 30 minutes it actually takes between 35 and 40 minutes in this oven.",
