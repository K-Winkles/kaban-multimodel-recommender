So far it has been very reliable as well.(i) The different functions have been great - The BROIL has been great if I'm using my oven for a main dish but need to broil a few sides or finish other dishes. BAKE takes a while to heat up but a lot faster our main kitchen oven when making a small snack for the kids. TOAST is what it says but the timer settings don't line up if you are a doing something frozen compared to a room temp item... not a big deal though.(ii) The trays are not but not sure I notice a huge difference when not using the crumb tray compared to when I do - especially if you preheat.(iii) the one tiny flaw is the design of the door. It doesn't actually open to 90 degrees or more (see my side angle picture) Not a huge deal but when things are hot it makes taking the tray our a little tricky because you almost have to life up a bit which can cause your item to slide on the rack or spill.The key feature for us were the dimensions of the unit - thankfully it has been a great toaster as well.",

                "reviewText": "I have a cabinet with a built in toaster oven garage with a door that is exactly 11 inches in depth. While there are nicer and more high tech toaster ovens I would have liked to look at, this is actually one of maybe only 3 sold by any manufacturer that will fit. I got it to replace a Black and Decker model from the early 90s that had the toaster button with a darkness knob that was very intuitive. The world has moved on and now all toaster ovens use the controls this one does where you set which elements the heat will come from (top/bottom/both), how much power to apply, and a timer knob. When you set the knob you can actually hear it ticking down, and a loud \"ding\" goes off when it is done. As other have noted, it is a bit of an art to remember exactly where to set the knob - you also do not have to set the knob to 10 and then turn back to the left, but you do have to turn it past the mark with the half cooked toast slice or it won't ever stop counting down. Probably most inconvenient thing is that you have to remember to reset both of the upper knobs to \"Toast\" setting if you use it for any other purpose. Cleaning is a matter of removing a tray at the bottom, my previous one had a more convenient trap door that opened the entire bottom. But overall it seems high quality, safe, looks nice, and is a good replacement what I had.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this to replace a previous one where the lower warmer had died. Needed this model because we have limited counter space between our refrigerator and stove. Usually a new model will be improved, but not in this case. Dials much harder to read, turn and set. Needed a flashlight to read them at first. Has 3 settings for toast. None of them are accurate Hard to find the \"start\" or \"set\" position on dials.",
