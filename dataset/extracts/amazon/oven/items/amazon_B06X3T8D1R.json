                "reviewText": "I like it. It's a nice, easy-to-use design but, a few things to be aware.-- As another reviewer mentioned, it's true that the writing on the knobs isn't easy to read because it doesn't have the high contrast that black on white does. However, once you know how each knob works - the lettering is less important.-- The exterior DOES get very hot - it's metal. So, plan on only touching the handle when it's on and not placing anything plastic nearby.-- The interior is not as large as my prior toaster oven which is a bit of a bummer. The good news about that is it toasts things a bit more quickly. The bad news is I can't really cook a small, deep casserole or oatmeal bake in it like I could my prior one.As long as you understand *what* you're buying, it's a good item.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good basic Toaster Oven at a good price-point",
                "reviewText": "This is a basic Toaster Oven - sized at \"4 slice\" so it has a small footprint, unlike the \"6 slice\" which are significantly larger. No frills, low cost, and it works.The GOOD: I like the way they put the drip pan under the rack. It slides in/out when roasting or broiling. Saves having to have a separate drip pan/rack for roasting and broiling - means another 1\" or so of clearance inside oven. Great design idea.I thought the BAGEL option would be useless, but it has turned out to be a good feature. Basically, anything which you want toasted on one side and just warmed on the other (bagels, English muffins, croissants, sandwich rolls, etc.) you put the food on the rack in the upper level cut-side-up and use the BAGEL setting. Works well. Anything you want toasted on both sides - like bread - use the lower rack setting and the TOAST option. Kudos for providing something I didn't care about but found very helpful.The slide out crumb tray is another plus. You don't have to turn the unit on its back and tilt out the tray like some others and fish around inside where live wires are located.It heats fast - appears to have a quartz element instead of the usual wire element and that's good.The \"COULD BE BETTER\" items - I don't like the mechanical timer. But in fairness, it works and the results appear to be repeatable if you use the pictograms on the face of the unit. But in this day and age, a digital timer would have been preferred, together with a digital temperature readout. Others complain about the tick-tick-tick on the timer, but I didn't find that objectionable. It's not really that loud.Many of the toaster ovens have only a 30 minute timer, like this one. I think that's too little - a basic meatloaf takes about an hour. Should have a 60 minute timer.It's hard to read the information next to the dials. The dials are large (easy to grab and turn) but get in the way of reading the settings. H-B has another toaster oven at the same price with what appear to be better black plastic knobs, but different features. Why two designs of knobs?The door slams shut. It would be nice if it were damped somehow.It is bright with polished stainless (so they say) steel outer material. Stands out in the kitchen. I'd like something a bit less visible, perhaps black, or perhaps a brushed metal, or black stainless steel. I know, that's expensive, but the option even at a higher price would be nice.The VERDICT:Overall, this is a sturdy reliable oven (so far), at a great price. There don't appear to be many 4-slice toaster ovens so this is a good choice, despite the things I'd like to see different. It has a small footprint and fits where the bigger ones wouldn't. My criticisms are minor - this thing does the job and doesn't cost a huge amount. Don't be put off by the confusion on where the rack has to be - you'll get used to the options after a few uses. Some reviewers complained about cord length. We didn't find that an issue, although the cord is short. High-amperage heating appliances should not have long cords. It's a safety issue.And by the way - be sure you follow their recommendations and run the unit at high temp for 10 minutes before you put food in, to burn off any residual oils used in manufacture. After that, there is no odor from the oven.",

It serves my needs, and I am very pleased with it. I like the different settings for different foods/toast/bagels/waffles, etc. I've used them all including warming cooked foods, and they are all very efficient. It didn't take long to figure out where to put the timer to get toast to my liking. I would recommend this small toaster oven to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "So yes, it has only 1 heating element, as most do in this size and price range, and you get a bit if uneven toasting but every small scale toaster oven I've owned in the last 15 years has been like this. However I will admit the blank space not getting toasted is a bit more than past toasters of thr same brand and model. It does fit 4 pieces of small bread but tightly, and if you want even toasting your going to have to rotate and move them so using 4 piece becomes a chore and messy. Our main complaint is the same as others, the dial to toast is weird - the toast section is about 1/4 span and to try and find the sweet spot of a proper browning is impossible. Either you get burned or undercooked and going a tiny bit past the light will get you black so you have to babysit your toast which is not something I'm super into nor have time for. If you walk away or turn to cook your food on the stove your food will likely be burned. Moving the tray to the lowest level helps but not much.",
