                "reviewText": "We just bought this oven and have been testing it out. There is a slight learning curve as with everything.The oven gets hot and cooks pizza awesome. We have not yet tried anything but pizza yet.Honestly the neapolitan rocks.Pros- gets nice and hot, cooking time short, thought it cooks fairly even without spinning pizza. All controls worked fine. Nice bright light inside.Cons- the pizza peel is terrible and takes a decent amount of flour to get it to a point it will slide off, which is a must. Tried corneal and that's a little more messy. Cleaning out kind of a pain, should come with a brush and scraper. Takes awhile to heat up and can be loud but not terrible and that honestly didn't really bother meTips- we have not mastered thin crust. But neapolitan we are close. I discovered that i don't love crust made with any oil, it's better with just flour,salt, water and yeast. Our crust was good but we are perfecting and will get even better, just need a few more test runs. We like putting fresh mozzarella on after it bakes to avoid water. Some toppings should be somewhat pre cooked due to short cook time and water content reduction.All and all, we would recommend it even though a little more expensive. You get what you pay for and this oven did not disappoint over all. Gave only 4 rating for pizza peel and cleaning with no cleaning tips or brushes provided.",

                "reviewText": "Here is my take after making 3 Pizzas and two days with this machine:1- Oven hits it\u2019s highest temperature \u2019 in less than 22 minutes (others has stated 30, for me it\u2019s about 18 minutes)2- Oven heats almost even, with area next to the window being slightly cooler.3- It bakes a Neapolitan Pizza under 4 minutes.4- The fan is noisy but not too noisy.5- The top gets hot, but not too hot to cause any danger.6- The lamp inside works well, you can see the pie easily.7- It is not too heavy or bulky.8-The stone and crumb tray are easy to remove and clean. Anything splattered inside, you are SOL.My only negative is questionable temperature. It is high enough for almost any kind of Pizza (just little longer time) But if you are looking for something identical to a wood burner, this is not it.The indoor competition is Oooni 12v and the Breville.Both are hands down better than this at over $1,000 each (after tax).They reach higher temperature 850 & 750. And have more bells and whistles.If you are planning to make Neapolitan Pizza more than once a week consistently and are well versed in the art of Neapolitan Pizza making and for some strange reason you want to have an electric indoor pizza oven (instead of an outdoor wood burner), then you should buy one of those.If you are like me, and you just want to experiment, learn and have fun at a very reasonable price, this is for you.Don\u2019t waste your money on something that may end up in your pantry 6 months from now.",

                "reviewText": "This oven, for the price is fine. Not fantastic, but fine. I have had no problem with the quality of the pizza bake or the peel. But I\u2019ve made many a pizza. NB: for true Neapolitan pizza, your HOMEMADE dough should be made with 00 flour and left to \u201cferment\u201d for 24 hours before using.My complaints are:- controls are not intuitive. Once the pizza heats to temperature, you must press the timer button AND start. Since we\u2019re all used to modern microwaves, I\u2019ve forgotten how to press \u201cstart\u201d every time. One would think that if the oven is to temp, it\u2019s to temp and no more other buttons need to be pressed. It\u2019s redundant and should just be a timer.- they are honest about it, but yes, it takes at least 1/2 for the oven to heat to 600-700\u00b0, and the oven is loud both in the preheat and cool down modes.- the only way to really turn off the oven, according to directions, is to unplug it. This makes me nervous & it\u2019s a pain to unplug in my kitchen set up.- honestly, there are a couple of toaster ovens that heat to 700\u00b0 or so, and they\u2019d be a better buy. This thing really only does pizza and maybe roasted asparagus or green beans (which are admittedly excellent at the higher temperatures.)- I was hoping this would be a bit more multi-functional: maybe I could use it as a salamander for steaks? But no, the spatter would be dangerous and impossible to clean.- do I regret the buy? I think so.",

                "reviewText": "Could not be more pleased . See calzone second from last pic? Looks great and does not take up much counter space. Perfect crust! Easy to clean! Ignore the comments regarding the timer not able to be reset lower. They don't know what they are doing. The timer allows you to adjust down to 30 seconds from any initial setting. It then counts down from there...no biggie! Btw, you do not need timer when making pizza because it cooks so fast, you don't want to leave it alone anyway. One of the best kitchen tools I ever bought!!",
