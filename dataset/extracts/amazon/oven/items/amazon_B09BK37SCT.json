                "reviewText": "This air fryer looks and works like a mini oven, sort of like a toaster oven but it has so much more functionality. You can use it like a toaster oven to make toast or reheat last night's pizza, but you can also use it to cook a real meal since it has so many more functions than a toaster oven. My 20-year-old son is actually learning to cook with this air fryer! For whatever reason, he doesn't feel so intimidated when using this air fryer as opposed to the wall oven or the stovetop.I like the toaster oven styling. I like that the front has a stainless steel door with a glass window so you can keep an eye on what you are cooking. This air fryer looks nice on the countertop and for as large capacity as this thing has, the overall size of it is not too big. It is a good size for even a small kitchen, I think. It is about 13.5 inches high, 13.5 inches across and about 12 .5 inches deep, The seller provides more precise measurements, but if your space will fit the dimensions above, it should fit this air fryer. The top, sides and back have air vents and when you are cooking the air coming out of themis hot, so you will want to have plenty of airflow around all sides of the oven.As for actually cooking with this unit, the controls are fairly simple. I didn't quite figure them all out on my own; they are somehwat intuitive but the instruction book filled in what I didn't pick up by just pressing the buttons and turning the dials. The buttons, for the most part, let you choose between air fry and bake functions, and also turn on the light and start/stop heating. The dial lets you choose a precise time and temperature (or preset cooking times and temps for specific foods, but I have not used any of the presets as I prefer to follow recipes' specifed times and temperatures).This air fryer comes with several pans and racks, as well as a crumb tray to cach spills at the bottom. I like that the oven has various slots to hold the pans or racks in different positions inside the oven, either closer to the top heating element or closer to the bottom of the unit.Overall this air fryer works great and we love it. It is great looking and takes up less space than I thought it would, and it is very functional, whether you are roasting raw chicken breasts for a full meal, baking cookies, making \"skinny\" air-fried French fries, or just heating up a frozen pizza. This air fryer is basically like a mini oven, and while it is a great choice for any kitchen, it would be a terrific option for someone who doesn't have a kitchen, like those who live in dorm rooms, or maybe a or garage apartment that has not been fully built out.",

                "reviewText": "This air fryer is by far one of the best I have owned. The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek design. It being more of a box instead of round allows it to fit in the corner of my counter and frees up a lot of needed space being in an apartment. I also like that you can cook multiple things at a time due to having multiple racks. The cleanup is easy due to the pull out tray, and the functionality is great. It tells you which button to press based on what you were cooking, and it does all the hard work. Did I mention cleanup is a breeze!",
