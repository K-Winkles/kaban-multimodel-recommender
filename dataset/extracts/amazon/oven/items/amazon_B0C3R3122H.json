Just for my mother to make meals only for herself, she got excited to be able to use the Air Fryer option for french fries! It is easy to clean for the most part should any food scraps fall during cooking...The cooking options are easy to understand as well as the temperature gauge, and timer is always a necessity. The surprising \"BONUS\" was this toaster oven also has a LIGHT! This is really a great product, well made and multi-purpose.",

We downsized and moved into a new home, so purchased our second Aumate, of course! After only 5 months, all functions died except toaster. We contacted Aumate directly, with our dilemma. They shipped a new one, after providing our Amazon bill of sale; no questions asked and did not want the broken one. We are extremely happy with customer service of Aumate!!",

The entire oven is the exact same Look of the Samsung, I now am wondering if this company is owned by Samsung? It works Great, I learned to cook with my moms All the countless Items . I do believe bc it\u2019s j just the same Oven, Except A Lot were sold to Samsung & then a Huge lot to this Brand. I Am Very Satisfied since I have no learning to do since it\u2019s exactly as my mom\u2019s Samsung Oven. Just that mine is a Name that\u2019s not very well known. But compare next to Eachother and u would never notice. It\u2019s an exact replica \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb for almost $50 cheaper . I\u2019ll give it a 5.However we still Love to use our Air fryer in our New LG over when we\u2019re cooking for Family holiday meals",
