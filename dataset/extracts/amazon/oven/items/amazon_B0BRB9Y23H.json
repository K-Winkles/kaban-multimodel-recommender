                "reviewText": "I was skeptical about this oven but decided to try it out. Similar double oven units are generally 3-10 times the price.I have been running the oven for 90+ days so now I can confidently write this review.Bottom line is this oven is much more than I expected. For the price I figured I was going to get some kind of a residential grade unit re-packaged and sold as commercial grade. I was wrong. This machine (I bought the double oven) is all commercial grade.Stainless Steel outer has held up perfectly. Cleans easily and no discoloration due to heat. Doors and handles are all still tight with no loosening. Knobs, lights, thermostat all working exactly as designed.The only problem to report was the oven arrived with a broken pizza stone. I don't think this was a fault of the manufacturer because the box showed signs of an overly aggressive shipping company. Regardless, seller was super fast to respond to my email (literally only a couple hours) and shipped replacement stones right away.Oven has been in use in our sports arena concession stand for just over three months days. We have cooked several hundred pizzas and have zero problems to report. Temps are very consistent and the stone cooked crust is better than anything we ever did with a pan and an oven.Overall an excellent experience and will happily do business with these folks again.",

                "reviewText": "THIS is IT !! Was considering a lesser item, but saw the features I wanted here. This makes a pizzeria quality pie every time. A few things: it puts out lots of heat--mine went into the garage, 4\" from nearest walls, made a heat shield to go in back of it--safe. Recommended heat setting is 525F--too hot, made crust hard. I went to my usual setting of 425F, 8 mins, rotate 180 degrees--perfect--may cook a little faster now. Used a Walmart 13\", fresh 5-cheese pie, added my own topping of diced bell pepper, no meat, removed excess cheese--perfecto!Stone is a little thin but works OK, use care with it. May change my name to Luigi!! JW, Las Vegas.",

They were completely raw and had to leave them for 30 mins at max temperature so they would start to raise. They came out burned on top and still raw in the middle, a disaster. When cooking pizzas it had to be at the max temperature and took ages to heat up. Pretty much this over is useless for anything other than to rack up your electricity bill to cook an average pizza. The front sticker became discolored with an off white color. Sent it back and got a NuWave iq360 and cooks everything amazingly quickly and well.",
