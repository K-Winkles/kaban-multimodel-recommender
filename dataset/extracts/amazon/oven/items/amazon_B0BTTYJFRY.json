                "reviewText": "I have been eyeing Dutch Ovens for about a year, maybe 2. Like pretty much everyone else, I ogle over Le Creusets and their beauty out of the cabinets on everyone else\u2019s stoves. The warmth and colors- and of course the mouthwatering food they produce. I couldn\u2019t justify the expense, and most of the other brands either didn\u2019t fit my style, or had a knob I knew I would have to replace for use in the oven\u2026 then I saw this one.The color, quality, pattern and lack of a brand on the top really set it apart from the other off brands available. The turquoise color and lid design match our eclectic Southwestern decor seamlessly. The price was perfect for what I\u2019m willing to spend right now. So even with my lack of knowledge on the Spice brand- the small 20+ amount of 5 star reviews convinced me this was a purchase I could take a risk on.Boy does this baby cook! I have an Always Pan and an Instant Pot that I do most of my cooking in- the real downside is that neither of those can go in the oven. Even with the crisp attachment on the instant pot- I never get that dreamy bubbling crust I crave from cheesy casserole dishes- and I really hate using multiple pots and pans for 1 meal especially on a weeknight. This is the solution! I can do EVERYTHING in this pot and then put it in the oven. The first thing I made was a chicken broccoli bake- and even though my photo isn\u2019t the prettiest to look at- it was TASTY! Evenly cooked all the way through, with a beautiful cheesy crust. Yum! We have a roommate at the moment who isn\u2019t always home at the same time- even an hour and a half after taking it out of stove it was still warm for him!***UPDATE***Cooked a whole chicken and Brussels Sprouts dinner in 1 pot! The chicken was PERFECT! I think I\u2019ll skip doing whole chickens in the instant pot and just use this \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0bI\u2019m a super happy satisfied camper. I will be buying these as gifts at this price for weddings and holidays! I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ll register for a Le Creuset after this! I\u2019ve never personally cooked with the one- but I really can\u2019t see there being a huge difference with how even this cooked.I can\u2019t wait to make bread, braise, make soups, pot roast, deep fry\u2026. Etc!Would highly recommend to anyone! The quality is exceptional and the value for money is on point!***UPDATED AFTER USE OVER A MONTH OR 2***This Dutch oven has been an every other day use item since I got it. I do love it- the food is phenomenal. However the paint is starting to wear and chip on the outside. It doesn\u2019t really bother me. The product still performs. I won\u2019t change the star on it unless the inner white enamel starts to chip.I\u2019m very pleased with food that has come out of it- just did a 4 lb pork shoulder inside on a weekday! I still leave it on the stove- even with the chips. It hasn\u2019t been dropped or washed any harder than a heavy cast iron pan would be. I consider myself to be pretty strong in terms of holding it up- but haven\u2019t had to really scrub it.I bought the turquoise one- which chipped maybe a month or 2 after I bought it.I would still recommend this product\u2026 just might not buy it for someone else\u2026 or pass it down. I will be registering for the luxury French pot when the time comes \ud83d\ude09",

I've used it a couple of times for sourdough bread and simmering beans and soups. Excellent performance and it's very attractive too. It seems that it would last a lifetime as long as it's well cared for. It is heavy and solid.",
