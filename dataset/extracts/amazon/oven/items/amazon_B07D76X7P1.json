                "reviewText": "I spent WAY TOO MUCH TIME looking for a replacement toaster oven to replace the one we had for 13 years. We don't even know which brand we had because it was given to us for our wedding, and whatever label was on it wasn't readable.We are generally thrifty people, so it was tempting to go to the Black Friday sales and get one for $10-$20. We also debated whether or not we wanted one that would rotisserie and air fry. To get those functions we were seeing prices from $200-$350, and many of the reviews said that the toasting function was sub-par. I guess the \"all in ones\" can't really do it all. I went on several review sites, consumer reports, etc., and the top rated toaster ovens would often get many really great reviews and then several that were really negative, depending which site you were on. This De'Longhi Livenza Compact 1800W had none or almost no negative reviews. I think one person gave it a negative or less than \"stellar\" review because the rack didn't automatically come out when you opened the door. OH NO! (Seriously?)We were looking for one that:1. easy to use2. easy to READ (ageing eyes.)3. TOASTED well4. broiled5. fit on our counter without taking up too much space------This one fit those criteria, plus BONUS:1. lights inside when cooking2. beeps when finished3. convection cooking is more efficient4. Stainless steel looks great on our counter topWe have cooked pizzas, pies, and a host of other things in it. It is so much easier than using the big oven when you don't have a lot to make.We put ours up on a small shelf so we can put items beneath it, so I don't notice the door not opening all the way, nor do I notice it gets too hot. We store the pan that came with it and a small broiler pan we used in our old oven on the top of this oven, as the air vents are only on the right side, so there is plenty of room for them without blocking the air vents.Only gave 4 stars for cleaning, because other than pulling out the crumb tray, haven't needed to, and can't speak to that feature. Also only 4 stars for value because even though we got it on Cyber Monday at a cheaper price than it is normally, I still think paying over $100 for a toaster oven is a bit much. Also, we haven't used the app that supposedly is available.We really like it and highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "My mom gave me her old De'longhi toaster/oven and I used it for 12 more years until the top burner went out. This oven is very similar to the one I had and I love it. I read the complaints about the door but decided to try it anyway. The old model had a much better door. It opened flat and made it very easy to remove whatever you're cooking. Sometimes new ideas aren't always best. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. But, it's still manageable. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.",

                "reviewText": "It has been many years since I had a toaster oven as I wanted the perfect one... so glad I waited! This toasts bread, reheats pizza and other items to perfection. I love that it's compact and looks attractive.It's easy to use once you understand the steps. Trust me on this. My mom ordered this a few months ago and showed me how to use the controls which was helpful. She is 86 and figured it out herself!I can't wait to try out the many features this oven has. Really happy with my purchase!",

                "reviewText": "Had a Black & Decker toaster oven for many years and loved it. I like using these for reheating pizza and toasting buns. I thought why not upgrade and get a new one. What a mistake, I thought. I purchased a toaster oven combo on sale for $99 and it did not toast at all. After reading reviews online I decided on a Delonghi. It works great! I'm a happy toasting camper again.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this oven to replace a very out-dated toaster oven. With the kids gone we\u2019re just cooking for two, so most of the time the large oven was over-kill for what we needed to bake. This oven has been the perfect size for us.It doesn\u2019t take up too much room on the counter, yet has plenty of interior space for our baking needs. Temperature is very accurate and pre-heat times are very quick at approximately 100 degrees per minute. I don\u2019t agree with any of the reviews that the controls are hard to figure out, it\u2019s all very intuitive. Easy to clean with non-stick interior and included crumb tray. We also love the interior light so we can keep an eye on the food. It does everything we wanted from a small oven at a very reasonable price, and looks great doing it. We\u2019re very happy with this purchase.",
