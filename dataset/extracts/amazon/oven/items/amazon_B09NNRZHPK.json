I haven\u2019t used my big oven in 10 years; I\u2019m a widow and cook for one or 2 people. The size is perfect, it has a light with a switch on the outside so it\u2019ll stay on when the door is open which my others didn\u2019t. It has timers, one for cooking and one for toast. No bells and whistles to figure out which is important to me. It has regular and convection bake and it makes the best toast in record time. It\u2019s my \u201cdream machine\u201d. I hunted online for 2 days, read reviews till my eyes crossed, and was about to give up when I came across this one. I hope it lasts a long time because I use it every day and I love it!",

                "reviewText": "Have now used 8 times and am impressed. The air fry works great, french fries or tots cook very quickly and are nice and crisp. Most sites say 400 degrees for 10 minutes then shake and another 4-7 minutes.. Well first looked at 10 minutes and they were a little over cooked.. Now use 5 minutes, shake and then another 4 minutes, Same thing with use as reg oven it cooks quicker then full-sized oven. So recommend watching closely until you have experience. Old toaster oven took about 5 minutes for a large muffin, this one only takes 4..",
