                "reviewText": "This was a replacement for an old convection/toaster oven. I love the look of this oven. I wanted something with an air fryer but didn't want a rotisery. The size is small, but the interior is really big. It is good for one person and can be used to cook for 4. I have had it a few days, and it has been easy to use. So far it browned the meat nicely and also browned the toast. I like that it has an interior light so I can see while cooking. I have only found one thing that I don't care for: The display is constantly on. The display dims when the oven is not in use, but I would rather the display be off when not in use. There is no way to program the display to off. I could unplug it, but that would be a pain since I use it almost every day. I rarely use the regular stove and never use the big oven anymore since this is just easier and doesn't heat up the kitchen and blow up the utility bills. You won't go wrong if you buy this model.",
