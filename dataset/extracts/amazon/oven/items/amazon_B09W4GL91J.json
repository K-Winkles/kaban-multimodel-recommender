                "reviewText": "I've been using it 2-3 times a week for about 3 months and it has exceeded my expectations. 5 star review because this thing actually does everything it says it does! Who'd've thunk? You can safely purchase this. It's even easier to use than the YouTube videos would have you think. (Mostly because it's just a very reliable microwave with a capable toaster oven built in. The future is now.)I had a smaller competent LG microwave and a countertop Black & Decker convection oven (aka toaster oven with a fan) that may as well have been my brother. The microwave died. I was reluctant to get rid of my trusty Black & Decker along with the old microwave to make counter space for this but it was absolutely worth it.A couple of other reviews mention taking your time and slowly working your way through the different modes. Excellent advice. The following are test results in order of my experiencing them:Popcorn button test: 100% Nails it across multiple brands.Blindly adding time to reheat pizza test: 100% Nothing caught fire and the pizza was evenly heated.Pizza reheat button: 100% *chef's kiss*Potato button(!?): 100% Everybody needs to know how to microwave a potato. It's healthier, tastier, and more cost effective than ramen. And potatoesrule! If you weren't raised with the ancestral knowledge of microwaving potatoes, this microwave has it.Using the pre-programmed thawing for frozen meat, and bread: 95% This is never an ideal thawing method but it works really well here. Nothing was actually cooked and everything was evenly thawed.\"Air fry\" some frozen nuggets (from frozen): 100% Sometimes you need those nuggets from the red bag and this has your crispy childhood craving covered.Broil some diy English muffin pizzas: 100% AGAIN! Why not microwave a mini pizza? The bread gets soggy. Why not bake it? In a small convection oven like this the toppings may blow around. I hope you have learned something.\"Baking\" a 9x9 enchilada casserole for 30min at 350\u00b0: 100% Good grief! I was very hesitant to even attempt this but the oven in my apartment is a joke and it's summer. The cooking time and temp fell within the capabilities listed in the microwave instructions. Followed the microwave instructions for convection cooking and it came out great. Cheese bubbled on the edges, brown on top, and evenly cooked. Took it to a party.Microwaving a 16oz frozen lasagna: 100%...just because you can doesn't mean you should.Thanks for reading! If you're at all interested in it, just buy it. You'll enjoy the thrill of having an appliance that delivers on its promises and your accompanyimg sense of superiority.",

                "reviewText": "I have now only had a fully formed one of these for about 16 hours after a week of ...a lot of dumb.The one piece important item to pass on to you from that is to verify the mica heatwave guard is intact on the right of the machine. Be careful and do not tear it. Why?-Ge does not make the part for it. They'll talk about ordering another size you can cut down but won't verify it's the same material.- They'll also say you can use it without this guard, but don't do this without research first. What I've found is this little piece of mica paper protects your machine and makes it last exponentially longer.- They'll say 3rd party will negate the warranty while recommending you run it without.- Their CSRs are actually quite nice. It's just the company policy is terrible.(My opinion on this is anger. A whole microwave should not be trashed due to a piece that's built to be replaced....)I digress. Yea, I've only had it for 16 hours but I've run its paces to make sure nothing else is wrong. (I've been through a number of these now due to missing or damaged parts. Fyi: I was doing open box excellent/like new from all companies I was working with so I would not assume this is a base issue with GE but an issue with returned items not receiving a proper inspection for damage or missing items.)Now. Finally, what I think of it.Yall, I've never spent more than $50 on a Microwave. Granted, the original one I spent $50 would be more lile $100 now due to inflation but still. Considering you can buy a decent airfryer or convection toaster oven for under $100... this product is still more money...BUT as long as it is large enough for you (you can look up specs and the full user manual on GEs website...The full manual teaching you how to use it does not come in the box. It only gives you SOME direction. )It's worth it.Why? I now have ONE device instead of three. It lives up to it's name. For those of us that have tiny/efficiency kitchens this is HUGE. This alone makes it worth its weight in gold.It works. The baking function works. The air fry function works...and I've never had or used anyone else's microwave where the popcorn function didn't under or overcook popcorn....Even IT worksYes, the buttons are not lit ...so place it at eye height, somewhere well lit...or get one of those USB strip lights to mount next to it. But tbh... 300 more for lit buttons (based on reading reviews of other similar products) just doesn't cut it. There's some great videos out there comparing different 3 in 1s and I feel like this one is being underserved for the more expensive ones. Which I'd hope for 150% price increase to be... 150% better... but I'm unsure what this thing would have to do better for that to be the case. (Other than needing a larger oven.)All in all...even if you struggle financially if you can find a way to squeeze it... do it.Potentially buy a warranty for it if that's the case? They're fairly cheap for a 2 year... I did.For GE if you need to warranty through them it's a 6 to 8 week process. Yike. Idk about y'all but I can't be without my main cooking source for that long. I purchased from Best Buy in the end (while at one point I had purchased from Amazon) and their warrenty was like...$25. Worth. It.And final note on the mica boards: I bet 3rd party mica boards are fine for some day when mines old and yucked to simthereens.... and then I'll use one of those to keep this thing going as it'll likely be well beyond warranty by that point. If you're having trouble with your microwave definitely look in to these items instead of replacing your microwave... but if you want to replace it. Consider this.",
