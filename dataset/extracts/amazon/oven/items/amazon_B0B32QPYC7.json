                "reviewText": "Remember to measure your space before ordering this & take into account that the electrical cord is only 26 inches long & attached to the bottom right-hand corner on the back. Even though I measured to make sure I had enough space, I still had to install a power strip to be able to plug this in bc of the ridiculously short cord (a trend I've noticed that says it's for safety, but actually makes things less safe bc it necessitates the use of an extension cord).As for function, I really like the way it cooks. My husband & grandson love frozen pizza for my grandsons after school snack & he says this cooks them better than even my convection oven & it doesn't heat up the kitchen as much.Bacon & hamburgers are also standouts.Toast wasn't worth the effort, my dash visible toaster does a better job, easier.Vegetables have been hit & miss, still working on my technique, time & temperature with these.Cleaning is fairly easy, I covered the bottom tray with foil, I also cover the solid tray with foil & use a parchment liner to aid clean-up. I do find that the grease that hits the door will run down it & drip on the counter under it as well as cling to the bottom of the door.I wish I had noticed in the description that it does not have a light inside or a handle thingy to pull out the racks & tray. I'm not taking this off for that though bc it's not the products fault that I miss those details.I would purchase this again & recommend it to others.",

                "reviewText": "I've only had this toaster oven for about a week and I will certainly update this review if it should fail on me at some point soon.I've gone through many toaster ovens over the years, every single one has always come with an inaccurate dial, hated it. Was determined this time to find a digital one. I'm happy with my selection, it's living up to my expectations at the moment.Previous to this toaster oven I had a PowerXL, it's heating element was amazing in the beginning but it's slowly wore out over time.. and the temperature it cooked at was wildly inaccurate, it suddenly stopped heating food randomly, I would come back to my food after the timer dinged and it would be completely cold. I got rid of it and I don't miss it.So more about this Hamilton Beach toaster oven. Right off the bat the things I noticed once I get it on my counter.. the legs are uneven so it wobbles and the front panel was not attached properly so the top right corner has an uneven look. I was afraid to damage it so I didn't attempt to put it back on myself, it feels stuck anyway.. so of course the first thing I think is their quality control is lacking... The last thing I noticed is sometimes while it's cooking the fan can get obnoxiously loud, if you move the toaster oven just slightly it will quiet down immediately.. hoping in the future this isn't going to be a problem.What I really like is the fact that this allows you to preheat before the timer begins. Every other toaster oven I've had begins the countdown once you turn the dial. Once it preheats then it beeps you put in the food, you hit start and then the countdown begins.Now this toaster oven is probably larger than any other toaster oven I've had, it does take up quite a bit of counter space. Which in turn likely does cause the preheating time to increase but I feel the pros outweigh the cons at the moment.My only pet peeve is with the design for the door coming down, because this toaster oven is longer the glass door comes down directly on the edge of my countertop.. the side swinging doors would have been a better design.Overall I really do like it, I just hope it outlives all the other toaster ovens that have failed on me over the years.",

                "reviewText": "Quite a disappointment. I wound up trying this product after the return time had expired due to surgery on both hands. It stated that it was a toaster oven, but there is NO toaster setting! If you want toast, you have to broil it on one side and then flip it over. This is not a quick process, so don't plan on grabbing a quick bite of toast and then dashing off to the airport!!! Next there is NO light so you must pull out the rack to check for doneness. Finally, the door handle sits flush with the countertop when opened so if food has to go back in for more time, there is no good way to lift the door back up without getting burned. I would have returned it had it not been for the surgery.",
