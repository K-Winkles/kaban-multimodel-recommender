I had a toaster oven I bought at a second hand store for five dollars that worked better then this oven I had for five years I gave away because my daughter said get another one and when I seen this one with the burners I thought this would be great I should of sent it back but I stupidity thrown the box out.

                "reviewText": "I have used many of these types of oven over the years and the best feature for this one is the top burners. Very convenient for use in my RV. Even though you can't used both the oven and the burners (way too many watts required for that) you can start the oven and let it warm up, then switch to the burners, cook whatever and use the oven as a warmer, especially on cooler days at camp. Other features I like is the ability to only use the upper or lower elements for cooking. Sometimes I just want to broil. I bought an aluminum grill top for use on the burners. This turns it into a grill also. What I don't like is more of a design flaw. The rotisserie connections inside the oven are in the way of the groove for the top most rack. I have to shove the rack in if I want to broil something close to the elements. Overall, although this oven is not as large as my other ones, it is perfect for my RV.",

                "reviewText": "Love the oven and the compactness of it! The controls are kind of confusing, but you get over it after awhile of use. But, I bought this one over a single oven because of the stovetop burners! It shows in the knobs you can adjust them to 750\u00b0 however, that's the only temp we ever put it on because it barely gets anything to a sizzle! It takes a long time to get hot (warm) so making anything on it takes awhile!!!I would have just bought a larger toaster oven and an electric skillet. Which I ended up buying anything way!Great concept, poor follow through.",
