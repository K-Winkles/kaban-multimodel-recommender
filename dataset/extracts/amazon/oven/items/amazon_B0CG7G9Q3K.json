                "reviewText": "Daughter was begging for an \"Easy Bake Oven\" for Christmas and I remember a wealthy cousin of mine having one and showing it off. Well that thing goes for well over a hundred dollars now and requires specially formulated recipes and items that are sold separately and high priced. Crazy thing is it still cooks with just a bulb.At 1/3rd the price this toaster oven is a huge value and cooks real meals. It is quick and toasts if needed, broils and air fries! Daughter loves it, but we love it more, because she's always cooking up something for us.Oven is quick to cook, and some adjusting of the recipies will be needed. We found most items cook at 250 degrees and \"wavy toast\" icon timer mode at high altitude. Cleaning couldn't be easier.Get this... This afternoon I made a steak in it, and it tasted 2 times better then any restaurant steak I have ever eaten.",

The area where I located the oven does not have the brightest light available. Reading the dials is very difficult. All models of Air Fryers in this price range seem to have the controls on the side. Maybe if my eyes were young operating the oven would be easier.",

                "reviewText": "I got this to replace my ancient toaster oven that finally stopped working. I love that it is a multi-device I can toast, bake, broil, and air fry. Nice size can toast 6 slices at a time and also great for cooking smaller items like pizza and chicken. Comes with everything you need including mesh basket, bake pan, and broil rack. Very easy to use and clean when you are done. Dials are well labeled and easy to turn. You can cook so many things in this all in one it has been a game changer. The nice part in the summer is not having to turn on the oven and heat up the house if we are just cooking something smaller.",
