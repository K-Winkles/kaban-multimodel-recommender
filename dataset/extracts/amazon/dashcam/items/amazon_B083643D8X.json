                "reviewText": "Can't say much for the longevity, but if is like the other 3 I've had, it's not a problem. This is what I've been looking for. Hi resolution front camera, and 180 degree. And a rear camera with infared, and 720p (not my first choice). This camera works well with the drive app, although I find it easier to just hook it to my computer. I bought a nextbase (HUGE mistake), after hearing recordings from it, the Garmin microphone is much better and distorts some with the windows down. The only downside is there is no screen, but it's not the biggest deal, it beeps when you say a command, and you can get on the app and do everything from there. I bought the suction cup mount to make it easier to switch between vehicles. It's actually quite impressive that Garmin packs all of this in such a small package, the nextbase camera is huge and does less than this one does. Another thing to note about this camera is that there is no collision warning, lane departure warning, and speed trap/red light camera warnings on this one, which isn't a big deal to me after the addition to all of the speed traps and such to Google maps. This works well with my keyocera (low model Android) phone when connected to Bluetooth and Android auto. I've been waiting for a camera like this for years now, and I can only hope that Garmin makes a camera that can mount to the exterior of the vehicle in the future, and have it link thru the Garmin drive app, weither it be wired or wireless I don't really care. For anyone that is wondering, I have a 2011 Chevy 3500 pickup for personal, and a 2013 Ford F550 cab chassis truck with a body that will not allow a view out of the back window(company owned). That is why I would like an external camera. I use this camera between the two trucks. This is the best camera money can buy, do not waste your time with anything else. Garmin may time some time to catch up, but when they do, they knock it out of the park!",

                "reviewText": "Many bugs, completely unreliable, lack of common sense features, especially in this price range.I have had this camera for about a month, and while the video quality is very good, the rest of the camera is awful.Camera bugs:The camera locks up about when booting every 3-4 parking mode cycles. I cannot be sure what is happening; I just know that when I come back to the car after having parked, the camera will have a flashing green LED. It will need to be power cycled to start working again and there will be one or two parking mode videos making it seem like it locked up hours ago. Since the camera was locked up for all this time, the internal fan will NOT be running even though it's over 120F in the car, so it's likely that the camera also overheated.The Wi-Fi on the camera only seems to work for one connection, and then it won't stay on. I have to power cycle the camera to get it to work again.App issues:The app can be used to make camera settings, and for this it works great. However, it just fails at anything else. For example, video access is ridiculously slow; it takes a full minute just to populate the library page. In the meantime, it just shows an empty library message instead of some kind of progress indication. The app fails to load the library nearly 80% of the time, so you can never be sure if it's loading or just failed again.There is no way to manually mark a video for saving. If you happen to have an event you want to save, you will have to pull the SD card and plug it into a computer to copy the video or else you risk it being overwritten.Lacking features:The only options for parking mode is off, or some timer interval to turn off automatically. I don't understand how there is not a way to 'geofence' the parking mode so that it won't record at home, for example. I don't need an 8 hour video of the inside of my garage.The camera lacks a way to turn it off manually. In the manual, it states that you can just 'disconnect the power'. Well, since it's hard wired with a parking mode cable, that is a little easier said than done.I really wish I had gone with one of the Chinese brands instead of this one. Garmin is a well-known and respected brand that you would expect to make a high-quality and solid product. They really should be ashamed to release a product this bad.",

                "reviewText": "A few negatives: product comes with two of sticky magnetic mounts but the one that was inserted into the plastic part of the mount had the clear protective cover missing and I immediately had to use the spare. Sometimes the camera does not seem to connect and start recording automatically. It will flash green instead of solid red for recording. You have to disconnect the power cable and reconnect for it to begin recording as normal. Idk the cause of this. Happens to me periodically, just try to check it often. I use the parking mode cable but at times my vehicle sits for about 4 to 5 days. This causes all power to the camera to shut off bc the battery voltage gets below a certain level. It would be nice if it would still be able to register an impact and record or else you would be OUT OF LUCK if something happened.Pros: camera seems pretty good quality. I was able to throw in a 256GB microsd without doing any crazy formatting like the manual says. The parking mode cable box can be opened and there are a few black plastic jumpers inside where you can adjust the voltage shutoff for the camera so it doesnt drain your battery. I changed mine to 12V instead of 12.3V.",

                "reviewText": "The picture quality and video is superb. Size of the camera is surprising small for what I expected. Unit does generate a bit of heat and I believe may be do the size of the fan/heat sink in the camera really not providing enough draw to remove the heat being built up. Double sided tape to use for the magnet to hold the camera in place is useless. Already has pulled loose 3 times while attempting to remove the camera. FL heat must be to much for it...trying another double sided tape before I attempt to hot glue in place or some other method to keep magnet in place. Not even sure a universal suction cup holder sold by Garmin would hold up. All in all good so far except for a few small glitches/issues. Will use another week or so before buying another unit for the other vehicle to see if I can work the bugs out.",

I've had way too many close calls with crazy drivers over the years. Within weeks of buying this, I had another close call and submitted the video to the local police. The video was very clear (and shows my speed and location) and every time I watch it, I can not believe there was not a serious head-on collision. Thanks to the audio, I said out loud what I could read of the licence plate for evidence. A few minutes later, I saw the car parked at a gas station so stopped and snapped a picture of the full licence plate and the driver. The police presented the driver with a violation ticket and the driver apologized for the incident (haha, ya right... pretty hard to deny crazy scary driving when it's caught on camera.)",

All in the cord but i already knew that as per their instructions someone posted a review saying a power bank can be used well its BS so dont believe everything you read that aside this is the best dash cam ever made make sure you by the parking mode cable if you want to use parking mode",
