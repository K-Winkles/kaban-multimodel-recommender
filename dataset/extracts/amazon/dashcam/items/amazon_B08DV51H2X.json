This seems this is a rare issue with some, likely older, cameras.I contacted VIOFO by email and they immediately sent out a new rear camera, no questions asked. Recently installed it and it's working great.Other than that, it's a great little camera - good display, good resolution, good mounting hardware that can be mounted inconspicuously and won't fall off like some cameras. Has a lot of cool features that I haven't tried yet.",

                "reviewText": "I have used plenty of dual system cameras in the past, and I was looking to buy a new one that had great video recording quality at a decent price, which led me to the Viofo A129 Plus Duo. Additionally, I bought a CPL filter for the front camera and used the Viofo HK3 hardwire kit (in order to take advantage of the parking mode). This camera setup is great with the front camera having 2K capability and the rear camera able to record in 1080p at the same time. It doesn\u2019t come out of the box with those recording settings, so you will have to change it, but there are plenty of settings to choose from. It supports up to a 256GB SD card (I\u2019m using a SanDisk 256GB high endurance microSD card), which is great for the parking mode setting. For the SD card, just remember to format the SD card on either a laptop or on the camera itself. In regards of video quality, I\u2019ve only used it a few times, but so far, the quality is excellent and pictures are sharp and clear during the day. The camera video reflects almost true color (while it still distorts color, it does not alter the color too much). Also, the CPL filter reduces glare (does not eliminate all of it), and I would definitely recommend to purchase this item. When driving at lower speeds during the day, it is definitely possible to see license plates when you review the video. However, once you get up to 50mph+, it becomes difficult/impossible to read license plate, but that may just be due to the software and 2K resolution. During the night, image quality is ok for this price (with any low- to mid-priced dash cam, night time quality will be lacking). I was actually surprised by how strong the night-time quality recording is, and surpasses the night-resolution of all my previous dash cam.Finally, the customer service at Viofo is great. When I was trying to install the original HK3 hardwire kit, the cable was not long enough for my vehicle. I contacted Viofo customer support to figure out a solution, and Dane was very quick to respond with a solution. He was able to understand my situation, and the company was able to make a custom longer hardwire kit, which now perfectly satisfied my needs.For the price, camera features, and Viofo customer support, the Viofo A129 Plus Duo is of an excellent value and performance. While it can\u2019t match a BlackVue camera quality, it\u2019s perfect for me and my driving use.",

(Except the rear, they suck) Videos come out in great quality. Parking mode is a no go since it will kill the battery even with a battery connector to stop when volt is low.At this point if my front camera ever dies I will choose a different brand with better rear camera reliability.

The picture is a still from a video I took while working on the polarized filter for it, this is without a filter on. I used the HK3 for the install and it already has saved the battery in her car since we've only been driving it once a week lately. Downloading videos to the phone does take a bit of time, but I'm glad to have that option in an emergency. I like the fact that when you hit the save file button it saves those locked files into a separate folder which makes it easy to find. However, once you lock a file it doesn't seem to have a way to unlock it, you're only option is to delete that file, unless I missed something.The app is a bit clunky when you back out of looking at videos on your phone it automatically stats the recording again. So if you are in the settings menu and accidentally back too far out the camera starts recording and you have to stop it to get back into the settings menu. Also, the car has to be on or at least the key needs to be in the on position to use the wifi. I guess this is to save the battery, but if you have an accident where the electrical system isn't functioning right or it's too dangerous to keep the key in the on position you'll have to remove the SD card to get your videos. All in all, it's been great thus far and I hope we never really need it.",

                "reviewText": "Fairly easy to install and navigate the menus. You get all the accessories needed to mount both front and rear cam. However, I recommend that you use the provided static sticker to stick the dashcam to the windshield. Without using it, the adhesive pad on the cam will not adhere correctly and the dashcam will keep detaching from the windshield, especially when it's hot out. I can confirm that this is due to the adhesive pad not being thick enough, which causes the lack of proper adhesion to the windshield. I ended up replacing the adhesive pad with some 3M mounting tape that I had and it's held extremely well even after the car sat in 100 degree weather for hours.Video quality is pretty good for both front and rear. I have the CPL filter and it helps with the glare from the Sun. Only other \"issue\" I have with the cam is the mic. It doesn't pick up sound very well, but I didn't buy the dashcam for its audio recording prowess so it's whatever.Overall, I recommend this dashcam if you're looking for a good quality front and rear cam set up.",

                "reviewTitle": "A decent quality cost effective option compared to the premium priced dash cams.",
                "reviewText": "Purchased this to replace a 4 year old premium dual dash cam that had failed - probably the typical life of a dash cam in a hot climate. Prior to that an expensive big name dash cam only lasted 18 months.I selected the Viofo A129 Plus Duo because it was almost identical in size, shape and specs to my failed unit and was about a third cheaper than the failed unit to replace, so I figured it was worth a punt. It also had upgraded QHD Front and HD rear cams compared to HD at both ends for my previous brand (I have not named them as the product and support was very good but just too expensive now in comparison.)Installation was generally straight forward, however the Viofo A129 Plus has a UNIQUE rear camera cable so I had to replace the old cable with the Viofo cable. My car is a station wagon (Australia, Estate in Europe) so this was not a simple task. I purchased anyway due to the price differential and the fact I had installed the original cable myself so I knew what I was in for - about 3 hours of careful trim removal and routing of the cable. Ironically the original rear camera mount was identical so I did not have to mess about removing that component.I also replaced the previous hard wire kit with a new viofo (HD3) kit although this was not really necessary as the existing kit was identical, but given it was also 4 years old and I already had the car trim apart the small extra in $ was worthwhile to have an all new setup.So far very happy with the Viofo with improved definition and images at both ends. The CPL from my old dash cam was also identical so that just slipped over the viofo lens without the need to buy a new one. Time will be the test, it just needs to last 2 years to be more cost effective than replacing with my previous brand.So far my dual channel dash cams have assisted me twice. The first was when the vehicle in front decided to reverse into my car while stopped at a red light. The front camera proved he reversed into me, and that it was not me driving into him. The 2nd time my car was rear ended, again while waiting at a red light, the rear cam made it obvious I was stationary at the time. Both low speed incidents but the cameras made it very clear who was at fault if they came to insurance claims.",

                "reviewText": "I am overall satisfied with this dashcam, but I do have caveats you should consider before buying it.First, the app is completely nonfunctional, at least on Android, as experienced by myself and attested by the reviews on the app store. As far as I'm concerned, this dash cam has no connectivity, and you should not buy it expecting as much. Therefore, it completely relies on you being able to retrieve the sd card from the dash cam in the case of an accident, and footage can only practically be recovered by physically removing the micro sd card from the device and ingesting in into a phone or computer with a micro sd card reader, or some other compatible adapter.This product does not come with a micro sd card, which is fine as it does not claim to. It is worth knowing this, however, as you will not be able to use the camera until you have one on hand. Given the minuscule price differences for storage, I'd recommend a very high capacity class 10 card so you can have the camera use its full bit-rate and resolution without having to worry about it running out of storage or accidentally deleting important clips in the case you forget to hit the save button.For my vehicle, the cable leading from the primary camera to the rear camera was just barely long enough to reach the back of my vehicle. I drive a very compact SUV bordering large hatchback sedan. I ran the cable underneath the interior trim pieces in such a way that I did not have to make any modifications to the vehicle. If my vehicle was even a little bit larger, this would not have been possible and I would have had to run the cable in the roof of the vehicle, which would have required significantly more time and effort on my end as well as some permanent modifications to the vehicle's interior.My only other complaint is that the adhesives on the cable routing clips were entirely useless, and did not adhere to the plastic interior parts of my vehicle in any way. The adhesives on the camera mounts worked just fine on the same material, so I have no idea why this is the case. I used my own double sided tape to mount the cable routing clips, so have some on hand before beginning the installation project.I am very happy with the functional parts of the device; the camera quality is excellent, both cameras work flawlessly and with very minimal latency. Picture quality is excellent in daylight and sufficient at night. The camera starts up very quickly, which I appreciate, and the settings allow the screen to turn off after a brief confirmation of functionality so that it is not distracting while driving. The camera is reasonably compact. As far as the camera's components are concerned, installation was easy and required no troubleshooting. The UI is functional. I purchased this used from Amazon Warehouse, and would happily buy it again and recommend it at that price. I would not purchase it at full regular price, given my prior stated issues.",

                "reviewText": "I installed this about six months ago and it's just worked as expected since then without any intervention on my part. I've had reason to pull videos from it twice since then and the quality was quite as good as expected. It's a bit of a pain to install (as is any camera with a wired rear secondary cam) as you need to pull off various trim parts to hide to wiring to the rear of the car, but it's really not that hard to figure out, and if that's something you don't want to do it's cheap enough to have it installed professionally (or you can just leave wires hanging around your car if you don't mind looking like a grot). Overall, if you're willing to commit to the installation, the device itself is worthwhile.I did also purchase the optional wiring kit to allow it to be wired into the car's fusebox so it works in \"parking mode\" as well but to date haven't bothered with it - it works well enough plugged into the cigarette lighter socket. I still think it's a good idea and would make for a neater install... it's just waiting for the day when I have plenty of time to kill and nothing more interesting to do.",

Nighttime is a bit iffy but still clear enough to be a reliable witness to an event.My only gripe is I had to order the hardwire Kit separately as well as the fuse taps. But once I had everything, installation was a breaze.The wifi feature could use some improvement as well, as it sometimes doesn't connect and when downloading video feels slow.All in all this is a very good dash cam.",
