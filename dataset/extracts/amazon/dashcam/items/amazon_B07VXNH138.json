Just something simple to use just like my old one. This fits the criteria. I watched setup instructions video and the whole setup and installation process was simple. I was impressed with the picture quality and wide angle. I like it so much I bought another one to replace the one in another car in our household. Fast forward to last week, I noticed one of the SD card was not working. I checked the other dash cam, sure enough, the SD card was not recording as well. I was not happy to say the least. I contacted seller, and Ying replied right away. She asked me to explain in detail what's going on. Problem was solved with a few messages. I am very pleased with the quick response from the seller. I hope this dash cam will last me a good few years.",

It was easy to set up and the instructions were helpful, telling you what their recommended settings are so you at least have a place to start from it you don't understand what the setting is even for. The view is wide and covers far right and left of your windshield, and the day images are clear, but the night recordings are rather fuzzy - can't read even the largest interstate signs. Perhaps there's a setting I haven't investigated fully yet to clear those up. So don't misunderstand, I think this is a great camera for the money and I plan to get another couple of them for my other cars (this was for my husband's car).",

Camera still recorded, but I couldn\u2019t tell what my settings were. So, this new one seems to have a better picture than the first one, and just like the first one, this one has the place to plug in a back up camera if you want to. My first one came with the back up camera, so I got just the dash camera this time and the back up camera works well with the new camera. Overall, for the price and features, I don\u2019t think you can go wrong with this purchase.",

Also with the broken button if the card needs to be formatted, the card must be removed and formatted on a computer or laptop instead of right on the camera. This can be a downside on a longer roadtrip or even with daily driving depending on settings, etc. The provided suction cup works well and so far has survived in the AZ heat. Short of the broken button, the camera performs as advertised with good video and audio quality.",

                "reviewText": "NO WHERE DOES THIS WARN YOU that if your 12v cigarette outlet is a constant the Dashcam WILL NOT TURN ON/OFF when you start/stop your car,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOUR 12v IS A CONSTANT POWER.I installed this with the supplier suction cup which seems nice, I tucked all the wire leading from the dashcam to the only 12v outlet I have which was pretty simple if you have a little bit of knowledge on the interior of cars.When I plugged it in and powered on the car, nothing happened, so I turned on the dashcam, followed the extremely useless instructions, formatted the card in the menu settings and then started to customize the settings, which by the way IS A HUGE PAIN, not user friendly at all.After all that I turned off the car, the dashcam stays on, the only way it will turn off on its own is if I have the \u201cAuto-Off\u201d setting turned on, increments of 1min, 2min, 3 min. So not a huge deal, I set the Auto-off to 1min and it shuts off, and when I get in I just have to turn it on, no biggie right? Right.But, I was super excited to use the \u201cParking Guard\u201d and the \u201cmotion sensor\u201d for when I wasn\u2019t in the car, I recently got backed into and the person never left insurance info, no surprise there\u2026but with the Parking Guard set, and tested, the Dashcam won\u2019t turn off after a \u201ccollision\u201d is detected, it just stays recording, I watched it for over 5 minutes just to make sure\u2026I assume because the 12v power is a constant, it should turn off after 30 seconds after a collision and 10 seconds after motion is detected, so basically if I have the Parking guard turned on and the car gets bumped it will stay recording all night and not auto turn off.The Motion sensor setting won\u2019t even turn on, I set it to \u201cOn\u201d in the menu, turn it off and wave my hand in front of it and nothing happens, I go back in to check the setting and the Motion Sensor is off, no matter what I do it won\u2019t stay on.You cannot use the motion sensor or parking guard while driving, you have to turn those on every time you park. So that\u2019s dumb too.The night camera is 100% USELESS if you want plate information, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just as useless durning the day, I know it\u2019s wide angle but there is NO WAY you\u2019d ever make out a license plate number if you needed it.Do not buy into these positive reviews, this thing is junk! Quality is ok at best, customer service is terrible and the interface menu is ridiculously annoying to use,Keep looking and spend a little more money, this is 100% a you get what you pay for scenario.I read a lot of things on the internet that said you couldn\u2019t use a USB to power this, but I also saw where you could, I ordered a Mini USB cable designed for Dashcam and such that will fit this Dashcam, I\u2019ll update if it works.But don\u2019t take my word for it, go ahead and buy it and then be like \u201cdarn, he was right\u201d",

Had this for a few days and reviewed many clips to ensure the camera's quality consistency.Pros:- less expensive than other cameras- includes a 32GB micro SD card- wide angle recording as advertised- relatively easy to figure out and install- haven't tried to hide the cable yet so not sure if it's long enough- so far it has been functioning without issuesCons:- picture quality is not great, is very grainy in the dark and even during the day- would expect more from a FHD 1080p camera- won't be able to record any license plates or street names at night. When light reflects the camera can't capture any details- lighting must be perfect in order to capture car license in front of you- need to be within a few feet to clearly see license plateSummary:Entry level camera that records with the video quality being so so. Even during the day the camera does not adjust to the lighting so detailed info (street names, license plates) may not be recorded. The grainy aspect is also something that could be better. At the same time, it might simply be \"you get what you pay for\". If you're not looking for high quality video and just something as a peace of mind then I think this camera does the job.",
