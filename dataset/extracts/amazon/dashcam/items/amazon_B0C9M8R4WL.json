Fuse Installation Insert the fuses into their corresponding sockets (pay attention to the installation positions of the hardwire kit fuse and the automotive fuse).

                "reviewText": "This kit is certainly a better way to install a dash cam or radar detector. I have never been a fan of a dangling cords plugged into USB adapters for devices that will never leave the vehicle. This kit has every thing you need to make a nice clean wiring install without needing to tap into the wiring harness. Also the fuse panel taps make it easy to get the power you need as well as \"undo\" the install without any issues when you do decide remove the device. The kit does have everything you need for the install, no matter what style fuse box your car has. Definitely a worthwhile purchase for any Dash cam install.",
