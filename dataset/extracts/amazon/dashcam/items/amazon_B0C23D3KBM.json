That said it has a flaw that keeps it from being a five star. It only shows license plates when you\u2019re very close during the day. The one time I needed it at night it failed. I could see the car, and the driver roughly but not the plate.It however worked perfectly to prove in court that the city was operating an illegal photo radar and got a $279 dismissed. So it more than paid for itself.Overall for the price it\u2019s a good camera just know if doesn\u2019t quite get everything.",

Then it said to insert SD card (already was). SO then I checked to see if it had files from prior drive. NOPE. NO records of the recordings were found. And the playback features is nonexistent and apple laptop doesn't recognize the device. SO for a variety of reasons this unit is pointless.",

So having this camera to record everything she's doing, going and her driving situation on the road. Just in case of collision we can see the recording. I think this is a great and wise choice. The camera is very stable, reliable and good resolutions. Like the sleek design. If friends want one in the future I'll recommend them to it",

The product feel to touch aren't top quality but the product itself works exactly as shown on the listing so really no issues there. It's held up surprisingly with the suction cup windshield mount so far. Other than all that, I can see this as a beginners dashcam if you're new to dashcams. It offers many features and protects yourself if someone hits you.",
