My husband said I wish we had a dash cam that would be enough for the police so he doesn\u2019t hurt someone. We put the sd micro in plugged it in the usb receptacle, mounted on windshield and drove to work didn\u2019t see the guy for weeks. Saw him the other day and caught him cutting off someone and brake checking them. Police said they are going to be watching for him. Hopefully they get him. They said had there been a collision he would have been charged. The picture while dark was clear enough to get make model and license plate. Definitely worth the investment",

                "reviewText": "I came from a different dash cam from Shrinluck, and omgosh... \"2.5k\". That motherfracker was blurry, and night vision was gosh awful. This one... night vision actually works. I can't see the license plates on cars though. It isn't that clear, but way better than what I had before, but it doesn't matter too much. My desire when getting this thing was to capture road plays that I did or that I saw others doing. Capturing evidence from an accident is just a side benefit.I also liked the user interface better on this one. It shows the videos in groups of six with actual thumbnails, so you can get a pretty good idea of which area you're at quickly. The camera stays on there tight and is rather easy to adjust if you need to do so. It doesn't come with an sd reader, but I had already bought one for the other dash cam in case I'd need it, so it wasn't an issue.Setting up was a breeze, but I did need to buy a separate rear view dash cam to support that area of the car. I haven't really plugged it in correctly as I still just have the red wire dangling, but it's mostly just an additional capture of footage. As I said before, I didn't get this for insurance reasons. Just wanted to view my fast and furious moments and share them with others, and now, day or night, I can capture them with this. Decent product, but it ain't crystal clear. You want that? Fork up more money. This one is good for its price",

                "reviewText": "Have had this in a daily driver for over a year and a half; and for the price, I am satisfied with it.Pros:1. Price, price and price. My first dashcam, I wanted to try one, to see how I liked having it, without spending a lot.2. Smaller size on windshield.3. Good color and picture; but only 1080p. Newer cams offer better, but for more money.4. Decent recordings from front cam.Not as good:5. Rear cam resolution is not adequate to read license plates, or see details; similar to a VHS tape.6. Mirror image from rear cam. Haven't found a menu setting to reverse it.7. Marginally short cord for rear cam. Installed in a conventional cab pickup; and barely reached top of left side of rear window; inside cab. Would never reach the rear bumper area of the vehicle.8. Battery life for parking protection is short, especially in cold weather. Good for an hour or two, and then it's dead; wouldn't record an incident beyond that. Less time in cold temperatures.9. Some reviews mention the additional red wire to the rear cam. This wire is usually connected to the backup light circuit. The rear cam I received did not have this wire. Are there different cam models? Different rear cams?* Overall, an OK product so far, especially for a budget price. Am considering another one for an older vehicle we don't drive very often.",

I\u2019ve been looking for a new dash cam and there are far better choices , Don\u2019t be like me and a year down the line your looking for a new dash cam because these just stop working out of nowhere \u2026\u2026peaaaaaace lol",

The camera doesn\u2019t seem cheap or feel cheap but it just won\u2019t work from day one I started having problems, the camera won\u2019t stay on it will come on and off randomly. On day one I set it up with the settings I wanted it to be while my car is parked, G sensor and parking mode, anyways if you set this 2 settings on, the camera will start turning on and off while driving so I had to manually disable those two important settings in order to stop the camera from turning on and off, after doing that the camera started to work normal but what\u2019s the point if those 2 settings you have to manually turn \"on\u201d and \"off\u201d every time you park the car. So I did all the troubleshooting and the camera started working until I did turn on again the G sensor and Parking mode, the camera started acting on me again and now the camera won\u2019t even turn on, you can see the blue light on but the screen is black, the camera has been plugged all the time so is not like the battery is low\u2026 so I\u2019m deciding to write this review for those who are looking to get this dash cam but I don\u2019t recommend this specific camera maybe the expensive ones work better.
