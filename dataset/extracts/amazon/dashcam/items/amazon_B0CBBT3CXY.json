                "reviewText": "I purchased the Focuway T6 dashcam as a Christmas present to my wife. I installed the camera about two weeks ago and couldn\u2019t have been more pleased.Back to the beginning. I\u2019ve wanted to get a camera for my wife\u2019s car. After numerous weeks of research, I landed on this camera. Not only did I look at reviews, but I was searching for max features. The T6 fit the bill.Opening the box I found a user manual, front camera, rear camera(with wire), reset pin, 64 memory card and a sealed bag with an install tool, and a cigarette lighter adaptor. It was my intention to hardwire the camera into my car, so I didn\u2019t have to take up my cigarette lighter receptacle. Well, the folks at Focuway thought of that too. On the back of the cig adaptor is a port where you could power an item as well. Nice! But since I was still hell bent on hardwiring the unit, I also bought a hardwire kit. So, unless you want to hardwire the camera, everything you need is included in the box.The set up is very easy and I recommend following the instructions in the book. Before I ran my cords throughout the car, I downloaded the app and I used the cig adaptor to power the unit. Once I got that all connected, I disconnected the cig adaptor and started to run the wires. Both cameras offer enough wire to place them where you would like in your vehicle. The small tool used for leveraging trim to tuck the wires was a nice touch.More about the app. I have an IOS phone and had no issues. The only thing I thought was a bit odd was that the camera is a hotspot and when you hook your phone up to it, the recording stops. Not a huge deal since you shouldn\u2019t be driving and looking at your phone anyway. The app is intuitive and easy to operate. You can download video directly from the camera to your phone. Or you can remove the card, put it in a Micro-card reader and download to your computer. Watching the video in the app is a bit deceiving as you\u2019re watching compressed video. But it\u2019s still clear. Once you download it to your phone or computer is VERY clear!!!It came with a 64 card, and I know it can take larger. The camera will record all the time and when it gets full, it will start erasing the oldest stuff first. No worries.There are quite a few features in the app and you can adjust according to your needs. It even has GPOS that shows the path your car has taken (in each video clip).I\u2019ve only had this hooked up in my wife\u2019s car for about two weeks and I really love it. The price was right, and the technology is good to go. I plan on getting three more of these for my other cars. I\u2019m even going to put one in my daughter\u2019s vintage VW. Maybe I\u2019ll do a review on that installation\ud83d\ude0aDo yourself a favor and order one for your car!Pros: Price, Technology, and ease of set upCons: None so far",

                "reviewText": "For months I\u2019ve searched dash cams far and wide,cheap to expensive. Came across the T6 and looked up a YouTube video on it. One of the biggest features I sought after was,dual front and rear cameras and a dash cam that didn\u2019t need the app to run. This has both of those features including 4k (front cam) and 1080p (rear) cam. The app (Okaycar) took 5minutes to set up which allows ease of use and fine tuning with the settings. The box comes with the front and rear cameras,both wired,are more then long enough to reach pretty much where ever desired. Using the included tool I hid the extra wire up in the roof paneling. Within 1 hour of install,it was completely up and running with no issues and image looked better then expected. I did also order the hardwire install kit so the camera records 24/7. Definitely recommended for extra protection wile away from your vehicle. With the included usb-c cable to power the front camera,it shuts off when the car is turned off. The hardwire cable allows it to run off your battery. All in all,I give this 5 stars and can\u2019t recommend it enough!",

                "reviewText": "I couldn't find the question option so I'm doing this through review. I won't give a final till I see how this goes. My camera and the app doesn't seem to be functioning together. I can't get the app to show me the images/clips. When I try to open the app it asks to \"make sure wifi signed in\" but says couldn't open. I deleted the app and redownloaded. Doesn't let me go to settings either. So basically it's useless to me right now. Set-up was a breeze. Though in their video it would be nice if they stuck with one car (different hatch backs) and explain/show best spot to place the camera. I placed it where the gentleman in the video does and at the time when my camera functioned for a little, it shows that I need to center my camera since the left side of my car doesn't show. If the vendor reads this, please help. This is not my final review.Thanks,Marc",

                "reviewText": "I have tried several dash cams prior to this one. Those were all returned because they stated they were \"4k\" but the picture quality was terrible or rear cameras wouldn't work. This dash cam has clear videos and photos. You can actually see the other cars license plates, not just pixelation like others I've tried. Even the rear 1080 camera has better quality than others main \"4k\" camera.This camera was very easy to install even with the rear cam, plenty of wire to run all the way from the rear license plate to behind the mirror.The camera is very sleek and I like the display when it's active. You can fully turn off the volume so you don't have to hear the messages every time car turns on. Has a nice red accent around it which is a nice touch.The dash came with an additional mount which great because you can just slide the cam off the mount with out having to fully remove or install a new piece of double sided tape. The camera also came with a 64gb sd card which was an awesome surprise since many others recommend certain cards but include none.Highly recommend this dash cam for the price!",
