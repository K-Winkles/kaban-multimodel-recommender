                "reviewText": "I used this dash camera most of the summer in a Nevada high desert area and was impressed with the results. First, it stayed securely stuck to the windshield in spite of being exposed to some extreme temperatures while parked in the desert during very hot days. I\u2019ve experienced adhesive melting and camera coming loose with a previous camera. Also, it was very easy to download the phone app and get the camera paired and running in little time. Processing the video files for editing or adding to a movie clip are easy and straightforward. One negative observation that I haven\u2019t been able to figure out is that occasionally the video will have a slight \u201cflicker\u201d from light to dark during playback. It doesn\u2019t happen often and it\u2019s not that much of an issue to me, but it\u2019s the reason for only 4 stars. Overall I consider this camera to be a decent value for the money.",

It does take atleast a minute to hook up in up but app is easy to use and the cam starts recording everytime you start your car .The issues are that a high speed SD card is required for it to work properly and quickly . I had a spare SD card but not high speed enough for this cam and now an annoying voice reminds me every so often to use a high speed SD card . A nice feature that it tells you what's wrong but a regular Joe SD card is not recommended . Also while it does support 24 hour parking mode , you need to buy a hard wire kit to even use this feature as a hard wire kit is not included and the cable that is included only works when car is on .So make sure you have a good SD card and a hardwire kit for the 24 hour parking mode feature . Other than that a solid camera . Works good even at nightThey should include an option to include a hard wire kit at check out.",

The cord is long enough for you to sneak it around the edge of the window and not hanging down in your field of view.The major drawback is that this is hardwired into a 12 volt lighter plug-in. Unfortunately, mu cars have USB plugs not 12 V/cigarette lighters. In my car my only 12 V plug in the driving cabin is in the center consul between the front seats. That leaves this camera, for me, not practical. It would be better if they created this with a USB end.I did receive this item for free. However, this is my fair and honest review.",
