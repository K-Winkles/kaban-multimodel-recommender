                "reviewText": "The Milerong Dash Cam kit comes with both the main front camera/recording unit, and a rear backup-style camera that you can place really where ever you wish. The kit comes with the power cable, two different mounts, the microSD card for memory and the cable connection for the additional camera.Operation of the dash cam itself is very straight forward, there are a series of menus with very blatant options and ability to change them. When the dash cam powers on it immediately starts recording. This is great for just having it plugged in on a accessory only 12v supply or in a cigarette power adapter plug that is only active when the vehicle is on. That way you aren't draining your battery and it goes off an on when you start and turn-off your vehicle. It can record audio also, but I have tried it and it picks up a lot of open window noise or car radio sound. The power cable is long and you can easily mount it where you want and hide the cable around the windshield interior framing.The camera takes great video in 2.5K resolution and it's very smooth. There are no hiccups or blurring or tearing video frames when replaying. It's very clear, and for the price point, is one of the better dash cams I have tested. The night vision is ok, nothing to write home to mom about, but it does the job. I wouldn't expect to be reading plate numbers at night unless you are literally riding the rear bumper of the car in front of you which I don't recommend. However, day time video is great, color is nice, and I was impressed with the clarity and sharpness of the output. The 64GB card is ample memory for it and it has an automatic overwrite mode that just continues with recording over the oldest saved video when space ends.Overall, I recommend the dash cam, for the price point, its a quality device and will get the job done without costing you a ton of money. I have run mine in the freezing winter and heat of summer beating on the windshield and it has not failed me once or froze or overheated, even the suction cup mount has never let go since original install. Great product, give it a try!",

                "reviewText": "I reviewed this once and Amazon didn't approve the review, I am not sure why. This is a great little camera for the price. As far as video quality goes, I think most dashcams are woefully inept at providing a good picture. But this one holds its own with any other dashcam out there, at a much more attractive price point. The kit comes with a front-facing camera as well as a rear-facing camera.The one thing that I wish this camera included was a GPS. In the event of a crash, it would be nice to know which way you were going, and the speed involved, etc... But this camera is more than adequate to establish fault in a collision. And that is really what we are looking for in a dash cam.",

                "reviewText": "Updated: I reached out to the company and they sent me the missing parts quickly. I only needed to confirm my order number. The front camera has been working well. Now its time to install the rear camera using the parts they sent.----I tested this out in my living room first to set up the preferences and make sure it all worked. The controls are not intuitive but I eventually got it. It is menu driven and you have multiple buttons on each side so you have to memorize what each does since you can\u2019t read them once mounted. And one button takes pictures so I ended up with a lot of those.I didn\u2019t notice I was missing the mounting screws and double sided tape for the rear camera until I had laid it all out in the truck. So for now, the rear camera is not set up. I did check the wire length for it though and it was good for an interior install Oddly, the rear camera has a red wire that pigtails out of the connector and is not described in the manual. I have not idea what it\u2019s for. The camera does work without it being connected to anything.I set up the front camera and the wire length was just about perfect. I only had to tie up about 18 inches of cable after the install. The kit comes with a mini pry tool to get the wire behind the trim. I tried it and it worked, but I ended up using my own trim tools since I had a lot of ground to cover. The kit uses a cigarette lighter connection that also has a USB-A outlet in the back. I would have preferred a T-Tap and wish the kit had included this as an option. Since this used the only outlet of this type in the truck, I can\u2019t use the Radar Detector plug if I ever needed to and have this camera run at the same time without buying a power splitter.The kit comes with little baby wire holders but I found they were too small for the wire and didn\u2019t stick to the plastic trim parts. It also comes with two front camera mounts. One is a suction cup which I used. The other is a double sticky tape mount. The suction cup was actually pretty good so I plan to stay with that for now.For the price, this isn\u2019t a bad kit and the install can be easy or hard depending upon how you run the wires. There are a few design and parts issues they really need to look at addressing. I may make my own tap to free up the outlet and I may reach out to the company for parts to install the rear camera For now,, we\u2019ll keep this and see how it goes over time. .",

                "reviewText": "In my previous car I had a front/back camera setup, and it came in handy when I was rear ended. I got this for my Mazda CX9 and installed it in about an hour. The cables are plenty long and I had no problem routing them. I mounted the rear camera inside at the top of the window as opposed to outside near the license plate. I've been using it for about a week now and the front camera can be set to display just the front view, the back view, or both side by side. When I power up it displays the front view with the back view in the upper right quarter of the screen, which is where I leave it set. It can be set to use Wi-Fi and playback on your phone, but I just remove the memory card and view the videos on my computer. This setup has a much larger display screen than my previous one and good quality video both front and back. I have it in case something happens while I'm driving but it has other features. Only thing I could not figure out was the extra red wire coming out of the rear camera. I did not see anything in the manual that addressed it for my installation. Good setup for the price.",
