                "reviewText": "Follow up after few weeks.I had made several road trips after I installed the dash cam. The video quality is pretty good. However, you have to format the SD card from time to time, otherwise the emergency file folds could be filled and not able to keep latest incidents.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My old 720P resolution dash cam started to show signs of aging after few years. With the worsen traffic and criminal records in Nor CAL area, I would not risk of going out without a good dash cam. My priority is a 4K front resolution with rear camera, plus parking monitor, as I read few \"hit 'n run\" incidents in nearby malls, including one from the Costco recently. I am not tech savvy enough to hardwire the power cord into fuse box for continuous parking monitor after power off, thus the one dash cam with a small built-in battery for few hours parking monitor became my first choice. Of course the price has to be affordable.After certain survey, I decided to go with the Heaboli HP88, which almost meets all my wants. The only concern I have left is whether the included rear camera cable long enough for my minivan. I sent an inquiry email to its tech support team, and gladly received its positive reply overnight.Upon receiving the new unit, I found the package was good ovre all. The manual was readable, installation guide was clear enough. Android APP was easy to download and setup, but could need some fine tweek. The included self-adhesive fixer and pryer were quite handy. I watched some Youtube clips, and had some knowledge before I started to install. I needed to replace the existing Micro USB cigarette charger with the newer USB C, which increased some extra efforts. Otherwise the total installation process was quite smooth and took about 40 minutes. I was worrying the length of rear cable, turned out I need to found a place to hide the extra 2+ ft excess cables.Have not started to do a road trip to test it yet, but hoping for the 4K resolution should offer much better video images than my previou 720K. I will do a follow up review after few weeks of usage if needed. So far I am quite satisfy with the product built quality, as well as prompt technical support response. Hope it could last another few years and never need to review the clips whatsoever.",

                "reviewText": "D200 has a better image quality than the previous 4K model I bought for the other car. I recently bought and returned a dash camera that claimed to be 4K, I don't think it was. This dashcam is leaps ahead of my previous one. When you open the box, you'll see that the D200 is well built and sturdy. Unlike other well known dashcams, it comes with a 64GB microSD card, so you don't have to spend extra money to buy one. Installing it is easy, all the tools you need are included. I really like the voice control feature, so you don't have to mess with it while driving or stop your car to press buttons. The voice commands are limited but work well. Also, the voice control is very responsive, and the dashcam easily understands all commands. The only extra thing you might need to buy is the 3-lead hardware kit to use the 24-hour parking monitor mode, I wish it came with it. Overall, it's a great dashcam with excellent picture quality and a sturdy build.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this dash camera after a friend who has one recommended it to me. I drive seven days a week for work and after hearing about so many hit and runs in my city, I felt this would offer me a lot of peace of mind. It was easy to install and the wires were plenty long enough to hide within the interior of my vehicle. Hooking up the rear camera seems optional, as the front camera can be hooked up standalone and will record but I wanted both views. It works as it should and automatically begins recording once you start your vehicle, and stops recording shortly after you shut off your vehicle. There are also optional settings to have it record \u201cemergency\u201d videos if it senses impact while your vehicle is off/parked, when it wouldn\u2019t otherwise be recording. Putting it in WiFi mode to connect to it via the app on my phone is a bit confusing at first but Heaboli Customer Support is fantastic and answered every one of my emails in a timely manner. Once I got the hang of it, I have no issues now connecting to the app to download my videos. The included SD card works just fine but does not support recording in 4k, which is the highest the camera offers, so I picked up a better SD card a couple days after having the camera and everything is working perfectly now. I also like that the monitor can be disconnected easily if I am parking somewhere I do not like to leave valuables visible in my vehicle. It\u2019s a great camera and I have considered purchasing a second one for my husbands vehicle. A dash camera is the type of thing you hope you never need but will be grateful you have it if you ever need it!",

                "reviewText": "First off, this dash cam fits perfectly underneath the rearview mirror of my 2023 Camry. Due to its compact size, I can easily hide it in plain sight. The setup was pretty easy and it took me less than 30 minutes to complete. The camera can be used with the app and that was also very easy to use. After having the dash camera for a few days, I can confirm that the quality is great for the price point. Both the front and rear cameras capture license plates clearly. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a dash camera.Bonus points for the parking mode! The camera detects any movements and begins recording immediately, which is something I was looking for when shopping.",
