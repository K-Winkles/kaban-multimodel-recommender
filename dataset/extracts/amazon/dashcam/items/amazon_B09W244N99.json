                "reviewText": "This is my first dash cam, and I decided to invest in one after someone ran into me and totaled my last vehicle. I only set up the front dash cam (not the rear one which I felt was a bit much for me). The dash cam set up was super easy! I almost went to Best Buy to have them install it and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t because it would have been a waste of money.It\u2019s been awesome having this and I consider it to be essential at this point with the way people drive. Recording starts as soon as my car turns on and I love that it\u2019s simultaneously recording a wide range of the road AND recording inside my vehicle. I haven\u2019t had any issues with the suction on the mount however the camera has slipped out of the slider piece that\u2019s connected to the suctioned mount a few times - no biggie, I just make sure the camera is sitting securely in the holder every few days so it doesn\u2019t happen again. Camera is super clear at night too. I\u2019m thankful to have this!",

                "reviewText": "First time getting a dashcam. Did a lot of research and decided to try the low-cost versions first. I expected to have the video not clear and maybe an issue with the recording, or just something. Installed this on an Audi A6, which took some effort to get the rear cam cable ran. Then just run the power cable from the outlet, under the dash, up the A-pillar, and across the front of the headliner until it gets to the camera. Still not bad at all for install, and setup was easier than that! I let it run for a few days and check the card to see what errors and quality level there is. All three cameras record clearer than I even thought possible, given their sizes. I was even surprised at the audio quality. That reminded myself to not be weird in the car anymore. I'm only irritated about the short videos being individual \"files\", but that's only because I suck with technology. I've now had this over a year and it still runs flawless. The ONLY negative about this whole system is the slot for the suction cup on the top of the camera loosens up in southern hot summers. That causes the whole camera set to fall off onto the dash, or wherever the cables permit. It dropped a few times and now the inside camera is jacked up. Absolutely my fault for not supergluing it after the first time. About to buy it again, this time supergluing that slot before I even suction to the windshield.",

                "reviewText": "This dashcam worked fine during my test run, which included both day and night, all three cameras, and testing out voice pickup. I would rate this dashcam 5 stars based on the price: it's an excellent value. Setup was simply, and directions were clear. Daytime picture quality was very good, while night time was fairly good. It does have an option to adjust brightness, which is great for night. I will say that the picture quality is not as good as a smart phone, but to be honest, from what I've seen, even expensive dash cams don't have an better picture quality. This dash cam picture quality is good enough though, and serves the purpose of providing a clear picture of what happened. I will say that the mic quality is not that great, as it picks up the noise of the car, making it difficult, but not impossible, to pick up voices (I tested speaking). Speaking is clearly heard up to 45 mph, but gets a little more difficult at higher speeds. Granted, my car is noisy. Overall, a good value, and a good option for a dashcam.",

You literally can not hear someone talk and only hear loud screeching. So this camera is excellent for visual but not to record videos.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two dashcams because ppl suck at driving (me). The first one I bought was an over the mirror digital display by Pelsee and it was GREAT. Sadly though, I have to angel the mirror downwards to get a good view of the front but then I can\u2019t use it as a regular rear view because it has to be readjusted. If your way taller than 5\u20193 and own a sedan, those type of cameras might workout for you. This camera was my second purchase and I love it too! I LOVE that the angel is wide and can be adjusted, I LOVE that it is tiny and doesn\u2019t obstruct the view of my rear view mirror. I wish the car port offered a usb port so that I could still use my phone charger. But anyways, this camera is great and though the screen is small, you can still see and even change format to view interior of car.",
