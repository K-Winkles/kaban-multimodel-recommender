This fits into my cam perfectly and seems much sturdier and secure than the original mount. It is a bit bigger than my previous mount, so I did have to move the placement a bit so it's not a distraction, but that's no big deal. Overall, it's a great replacement mount and highly recommend for the Apeman c450 dash cam.",

                "reviewText": "- Purchased this dash cam suction mount based on the vendor images that show this mount can be used to replace other dash cam suction mount bases by using the old mount parts on it. See review images for reference. The new suction mount works great with the old round part that has the screw-on part that my old dash-cam uses. Just take the new part that comes with the new suction mounts out and replace it with the one from your dash cam uses if it fits. An additional note, the measurements or dimensions provided on the product page images are accurate, which the round part that inserts into the mount base measures 16mm across.- One of my dash cams that I have for many years that works great, the suction base had become brittle in the sun from many years of use. So when it was time to replace the mount it was nice to find these suction mounts here on Amazon that can be used by replacing the round threaded part that screws into the dash cam.- The materials of these mounts are well made, the suction part feels tight against the car windshield when installed, and the dash camera has less play when tightened up or snug, when compared to my old dash cam mounts, which I still have one in use to compare it to. Overall, these mounts have been in use for at least two months from the date of this review, and they work great.",

                "reviewText": "When I got the Mount, I was a little worried because it didn\u2019t look like it was going to fit. The hook didn\u2019t slides into the slot perfectly and it seemed a little loose once it\u2019s in. After playing around with it for a few minutes, I decided the lift/bend the tab up just a little bit and it slid in easily. Once it was able to go in, it fit snuggly. The rest of the mount worked perfectly. With two in the box, this was by far the best option.",
