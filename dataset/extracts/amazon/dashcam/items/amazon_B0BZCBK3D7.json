                "reviewText": "With so many bad drivers out there, I thought it was time to possibly protect myself in case of an accident by installing dash cams. I really like how this one has the dual cameras - one for the road ahead and one for the inside of the vehicle. This way, if something should happen when my teenager is driving, I will be able to tell if it was in any way his fault. The cameras work perfectlyy and was very easy to get set up in the car. The video playback is nice and clear too. I think this is a really nice set up.",
