                "reviewText": "Picture quality is great, you can see details that can be useful for an accident. Case in point, I was accused of a hit and run in a parking lot. Another car suffered a broken tail-light and dented bumper. A witness said they saw my truck parked behind the car in the lot. We live in a small town so cops were able to use the description to locate me and my truck. I was accused of hit and run, however when I pulled up the video you could clearly see that I in no way hit the other car and in fact the damage was present before I even parked. So I was clearly not at fault. It was an aggravating and stressful situation, but in the end all charges were dropped and I was in no fault of anything. Having this camera was the reason and it saved me from a huge headache of a witness who didn't see me hit a car but said i was parked near the hit car ...thus someone's word agains mine. This camera proved their word was wrong. Money well spent.",

It was easy to install came with plenty of length for the cord and cord holder adhesive has not come off. Great value for a nice little dash cam",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this dash cam for a friend of mine, i had helped her set it up initially and several times afterwards, in the days and weeks ahead she asked me to make sure her camera was working because it would stop recording randomly. I made sure the recording was set to loop, and she had purchased a 128gig micro SD card so we thought it was all good to go. Needless to say, this morning while we were both driving, we ended up in an accident and as soon as i had a chance, stuck her sd card into a reader to see review the accident, only to find out nothing had been recorded since the moment she started her vehicle that morning. I have purchased other dash cams that recoded continuously all the time annd thought i would give this one a try after all the great reviews. No thank you, if you have to constantly adjust your camera settings because it stops recording then its a waste of money!!! take my advice, invest a few more dollars and get a better camera!!!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this dash cam to replace an old one. The vedio quality is pretty good for the price I paid but unfortunately I had to return it due to two reasons. The first one was that I was only able to connect the built-in WiFi to my phone once and never again (it would not broadcast signal). The second was that it would not keep the time correctly. After it shutoff and turned back on, the time would be off by one hour.The loop recording may be set to 1 or 3 minutes (Not 5 minutes). I did not have a chance to try night vision.",

                "reviewText": "I originally received a defective unit. It didn't seem right because the quality looked and felt high-end. Customer service reached out to me and my replacement was received within 7 days of being contacted. Holly was very professional, knowledgeable, and caring. The new unit is installed and performing perfectly. Great customer service, and a willingness to stand behind one's product are huge +'s. Holly could have let the negative review get buried and forgotten about, but instead made it a point to fix the wrong. A++ Customer Service.Now, let's get to the meat and potatoes-This camera is it. It has everything you could want/need. Including it's very own App that can connect directly to your camera without removing the SD card. You can download your clips directly to your wifi device. You can stream the live video feed through your app to check the quality and accuracy. It has great night vision, with an ultra HD 4K resolution. You can see the fly you just splatted on your windshield before it hit. Pair that quality with added parking protection, a g-sensor that automatically locks recordings in case of an event, optional recording lengths, and that ever-so important GPS Speed Monitoring (&recording) this truly is the total package. And the size is just right. It doesn't intrude on your view of the road at all. The only question you should be asking yourself is \"Why am I still reading this review!?\" GO BUY THIS CAMERA!!!",

The trim tool was a nice bonus, because I\u2019m not the organized gal that remembers to put her tools where they belong and never can find mine for very long. This one gets to live in my car.Once it was mounted I kind of forgot it was there. Pulling the video off through the app is slowwwww. I recommend just popping the sd card out and using a card reader on your computer.Videos are brilliant, just wish they were not looped - but probably a setting I haven\u2019t bothered to look for.Contacted support when my mount broke and they sent a replacement promptly (got it within a couple days!)I\u2019d bought another highly rated cam to use while I waited and I dont like it as much (if at all) & it cost a lot more. I\u2019ll probably give that one to hubs.The only thing is change is the power input from micro usb to usb c. (As it\u2019s easier to insert without good visibility due to mounting location)",
