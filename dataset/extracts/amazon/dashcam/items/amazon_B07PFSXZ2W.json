                "reviewText": "The camera itself is of good quality and the rearview camera is a nice option. The screen itself could be a bit bigger but is adequate. The picture resolution and quality are very nice and the anti-shaking feature works well. The suction cup mount would not hold but s tape mount is also included, and I hope that will hold better.Installation of the cameras is not easy and did not work well with the Prius. There are a lot of wires to tuck away and hide which requires some disablement of the car. A wireless version would be nice. The instructions on install are not very helpful. I had to google a video to get help. The red wire for the rear-view camera has to be attached to the brake lights and I am not car savvy enough to know how to disassemble the car to do this as well as hide all the wires. To get the cameras set up properly I will either have to hire someone or find volunteer their time and help.I do not have a SD Card, so I was not able to play with all the options but reading through the manual I like how there is sever recording options. In particular, I like the fact the camera can record for 24 hours whether the car is off or on. I also like the motion detection setting. If something happens to your car while you away these options can help track down the culprit.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars compact and solid quality dash cams for its price range",
                "reviewText": "I am pleasantly surprised by its compact size when I opened the box and delighted to see the solid build of both front and back cameras for its price range (I paid $54.99 + 32GB Samsung MicroSD card). Took me about 10 minutes to set up the first time since I did not bother to hide the power cable and connection cable from the rear cam, in case I don't like it or it has quality issues. I will try it for few days, if I like it I will then make the efforts to hide the cables behind the dashboard and side panels. There are many YouTube videos showing you how to do it.I initially used the suction cup on the front windshield, since some comments here stated that it may fall, so I wrapped the power cable around my rear-view mirror in case the suction cup does fall, the camera will not drop to the floor. Unfortunately during my test drive for an hour, it did fall off couple of times. So I changed to the adhesive mount instead. For the rear camera, the little adhesive pad just does not do its job, so I used the screws to fix it to the ceiling panel. I have an 8-seat 3-row SUV, the extension cable that's included in the package is long enough to cover the whole length from front to the back and still has some slack. Maybe your car is longer or you need to run the cable to the bottom license plate area, then you may need to order a longer cable extension.Powered it on and drove out for a test drive. I did not even need to format the 32 GB Class 10 SD-card and it started recording. The on-camera display can be toggled between front, rear and both on a split screen with different sizes. After a while I noticed the camera became really hot to the touch, so I turned on the screen saver mode (while still recording), this cools down the unit a bit, and let me focus on the road. Later when I got home I took the SD card out and inserted it to my PC card reader to view the videos (you can also take the entire front camera out and connect it with PC via the included USB cable). The front images are clear, the rear ones a bit blurry, but still OK as long as you don't try too hard to read their license plates.One more thing I see people here complaining is that the rear cam video image is mirror-reversed. This maybe a good or bad factor depending on how you view it. Your rear-view mirror is also giving you the exactly same reversed image, so the camera shows the same on its display. If it does not, it may confuse you since your brain has been trained to the rear-view mirror reverse images. Of course when you play the video on your computer, you see a reversed image and feel it's strange.Another issue is the 32 GB SD card is a bit small. I drove about 3 hours this Sunday and it's full. The front and back camera each writes a lot of large files to the storage, especially when you choose the highest resolution.Pro: price, quality, ease of installationCon: suction cup, 32 GB storage too small",

                "reviewText": "Scroll down for major complaint (second paragraph). Ok so I am the type of person where I really like a clean setup and the wires are hidden. First time having to run wires throughout the car. I decided to route my rearview camera on the exterior. Firstly, my issue was the adhesive that came with the rearview did not stick. I had to go out and purchase some exterior 3M tape from autozone in order to get that setup. By the way, it can be a real pain to wire that the first time so you might want have a couple (like 2-3) hours to spare or you'll find yourself with a dangling camera on the back (hello new scratches on my new car). Used WD-40 on the exterior before placing the adhesive which cleaned the spot up just right to place the camera. When it rains, no good use for the rearview image due to droplets of rain. Also, look at the space above your license plate to confirm if this is a good fit for you, or hassle. Camera position can get wonky so it is just a camera, not a good use for back up camera as you have to place your foot on the break to have that view or you'll find yourself switching the main view which is not worth it.I was kind of hesitant to buy this living in south Florida. Seemed to stick just fine. Last day to return was August 15 (who would want to return something they spent so much time wiring and lives a busy life?), it is now August 18th. First fall was on the 16th. I thought to myself, \"Eh, no biggie, I will just clean the window and stick it back on.\" Haha boy was I fooled, and feel played. So the camera and their functions are decent for the price. Not worth a SINGLE CENT if the functions are completely worthless because it cannot properly stay in place. For that, a single star rating as I am out of $50.00 (medical student so I can't buy another one) now and for at least 3 months cannot venture another product. Not worth getting a new one to have to rewire it or spend all that allocated time with the hassle. Now I have wires in my car with no function. Talk about useless.",

To get both front and rear cameras for simultaneous dual recording, at this price, I think is excellent value for money. The picture quality of the front camera is pretty good, the rear camera perhaps slightly less so, but again, for the money, I'm more than happy. The camera case actually feels quite well made too, and the sticky pad on the windscreen mount felt pretty strong when I stuck it on. I've only just fitted it today so can't comment on the night time picture quality yet - I'll leave that for others to comment on.",
