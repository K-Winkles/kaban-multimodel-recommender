                "reviewText": "This is my second dash cam with the first being an e-prance d101 which lasted 5 years before the memory card slot stopped detecting sd cards. This one feels well built and looks more sleek than my first and easier to use with the touch screen. My prior one did not come with a rear camera but now that I have it I cannot go back to just a front camera. The install was easy but I could see how it could be more difficult if you are installing the rear camera on a nicer car since you may need to make modifications to mount it on the outside. Since I drive a beater, I am not worried about wedging the cable into gaps and drilling a hole in the trunk. There is the option to stick it on the inside but you will get glare and reflection. The one minor thing I dislike is the sound it makes when clicking through the different options on the screen. It is the same sound as if you are dialing a number on your phone.",

                "reviewText": "After having it for about a month now, here is my opinion. First, The packaging is nice and adds an element of \"high end\" electronics. Inside is packed with everything one needs to install and more. There are extras in the event I want to reinstall in a different vehicle and also has the tool for tucking and hiding the wires which is a nice addition. The camera itself is very nice looking yet small enough to not create a blind spot. The rear camera is small and inconspicuous if installed correctly. I mounted the rear cam inside, on the roof looking out the back window, so it has a nice wide viewing angle. The rear cam can also be hooked up to the reverse lights so that it becomes a backup cam when the vehicle is put in reverse. The main camera feels well made and not cheap and the touch screen is very responsive giving the feel of a high end cell phone. I love the feature of just touching the right side of the screen to toggle through: Full screen main cam, Main cam with rear cam in window overlayed, rear cam with main cam in overlayed window and full screen rear cam. The video from the main cam is great quality (although I don't think it is true 4k) but still better than full 1080p hd. It clearly captures license plate numbers in front within a reasonable distance. The PC and Phone/tablet apps are nicely laid out with both the video and GPS map. Although I can't get them to synchronise on any of my computers, tablets or phones, and one of my computers is a custom built recording studio computer that has massive amounts of RAM and storage that runs in Mac or P.C. and still can't get the video to play smoothly or synchronize with the gps. So I definitely think that the apps still need work to speed them up. I can, however, get the videos to play smoothly if I open them up as just a video without GPS using a video playing app. If I had to pick 1 thing I don't like and/or needs to be redesigned, It would be the release button. I can't and don't leave the cam in my car when I'm parked due to the heat. Just going to the store and home for a total of about 30 minutes heats this thing up so much that It is actually too hot to touch. Given the ridiculously hot summer this has been, I don't know if it's only the heat from the sun or a combination of sun and operating temp. So, Every time I get home, I remove the cam from the bracket using the release button and it is a major pain in the @$$. I know exactly where the button is, as I can feel it, but I still spend 5 or 10 minutes trying to get the camera to release from the mounting bracket. It should definitely have the button on the front somewhere or a much larger release mechanism. Due to the type of car, the angle of my windshield and the very limited space in my car, reaching the windshield just below my rear view mirror is quite difficult, and made harder by the steering wheel pressing into my chest and the fact that I have to fight with the camera just to get it off without ripping the entire mount off the glass in this heat is enough to make me pretty irritable. Also, I know that people leave it in their car at night because it will record any disturbances to the vehicle but if some one is going to break into a vehicle to steal anything worth money, they are probably going to grab this camera first, defeating the purpose of it being there in the first place. Having said that about the release button, I still do like this cam and think it is worth the price and would highly recommend it to anyone. It is for this reason and because all the pro's out weigh the 1 con that I still give it a 5 star rating.",

The only thing I'm not satisfied with is the fact that I can't access the videos through the app when I'm outside the car. The only way I can access the videos is when I use the app inside the car.",

                "reviewText": "Updated Review:So, I was contacted by a customer service rep as a result of my review and the customer service I received was excellent. For that alone, I\u2019ve updated my review and stars. She was kind, prompt, and rectified the situation by sending me a replacement device.I\u2019ve installed it today and so far it is working fine. However, only time will truly tell because in the beginning, my original one was incredible too! I just hope this one stands the test of time. Hopefully I\u2019ll be back after some time to update my review to 5 stars.Original Review:The video quality of the camera is fantastic\u2026when it works. I\u2019m actually quite bummed that I took this long to write a review because every time I thought about writing one, it would function somewhat normally again and I\u2019d forget about writing a review. But now it almost never works normally that I\u2019m finally coming around to writing the review I should\u2019ve actually written 1.5 years ago.So, the product actually had power issues even from the very first month I had this. It wasn\u2019t too frequent, but it would happen at least once a week. The power wouldn\u2019t automatically come on with the car and I\u2019d have to manually press on the power button to get it powered up. Then, it would be fine. If this was the only issue now, I\u2019d still just make do with what works.Then, as the months progressed, the power issue happened more frequently. Until, eventually, my rearview camera stopped working entirely. It isn\u2019t a black screen, or anything that indicates a broken camera. It literally just has no input into the main body. I\u2019ve attempted to take out and plug back in the rearview camera jack, and there\u2019s no change on the screen. It is fixed on the front view camera only. So now my rearview camera is useless with power issues still happening.Finally, what\u2019s happening now is that it almost never powers on with the car. I actually will get power maybe once or twice a week. The issue now though is that it won\u2019t even turn on when I press on the power button to reboot it. So I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s even functional now.I just don\u2019t get how this is possible. 2 years is really not too long of use for this type of technology. And I understand if the response and feedback eventually slows down due to memory and such, but to have it be almost dead most of the time even with active power input? That\u2019s an indication of a poor quality item especially in the times we\u2019re living in.I\u2019m not sure if all hope is lost at this point, but I hope there is some sort of solution or rectifying the situation on the seller\u2019s part, to which I\u2019d gladly edit or update the review. Otherwise, do not purchase Kingslim products. They\u2019re not worth your business.",
