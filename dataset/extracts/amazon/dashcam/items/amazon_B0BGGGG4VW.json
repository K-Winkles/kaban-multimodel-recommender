                "reviewText": "Coming from an older Viofo A119 v2, I am most impressed with the size and build quality of the Vantrue E1. They have somehow packed a fantastic, feature-rich dash cam into a tiny, unobtrusive cube. It has some weight to it, and is not built with flimsy plastic. Video quality is super sharp during the day, and very impressive low light recording at night. Still haven't played with all the different resolution settings and HDR, but there are plenty options to choose from when I get around to it. Audio recording was ok but was picking up lots of of ambient cabin noise, but passable. The app works well for controlling the E1's settings, and transferring recordings to the phone. It was very easy to pair the camera to the app. Live View stutters a bit as it appears to be streaming at a lower fps, but not a big issue for me. Haven't used the included remote control, as the built-in voice control does the trick.What I really like is the magnetic GPS windshield mount. It holds the camera quite well, and makes it easy to remove the camera when needed. This was a weak point with the A119, the contacts would eventually become loose, and the power would randomly cut out until i re-seated it. With this E1 magnetic mount, it feels so much more solidly attached, and doesn't seem to mind some bumpy driving.All in all the E1 is a small yet very capable full featured dash cam, that gives lots of bang for the buck. Well packaged with everything you'll need to get it set up, and it's a Vantrue, a well respected name in the industry. Very happy so far!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a small dash cam that was not too obvious so this camera fit the bill. The features are impressive and the image and function is very good. I use the voice commands and also like the remote. control. It takes a little while to figure out all the features and download procedures but once you learn it is very easy to use. I also purchased the LATEST 3 wire hard-wire kit from Vantrue. It has minimum voltage control as well as the timer control. I set it at 11.9 volt cut off and 3 hours of parking. Both have been tested and work as designed. I did not use the static attachment sheet and just used the adhesive tape square directly on the windshield. It sits behind the rear view mirror so does not obstruct anything. I'm an electronics person so the installation was very easy and straightforward . The instructions don't mention the need to find the \"hot\" input to the fuse and to orient the fuse tap correctly so both the original and new fuse provide proper fusing of the two circuits . I think that if you are not knowledgeable in electronics and do not have a DVM voltmeter or similar voltage. tester you should have someone that has this knowledge. I like it a lot!",

The photos show the camera installed on the windshield, and the remote control on on dashboard. The WiFi feature comes in very handy to change camera settings, downloads, and general camera controls. Very easy to remove camera from its magnetic mount and bring it to your computer for download or settings. Windshield mounting is to first mount the supplied plastic sheet to your windshield and then attach the camera to the plastic sheet, for easy removal in the future. Surprisingly great camera for such a low price.",

                "reviewText": "I've owned this dash camera for 18 months, using it in two different cars. I\u2019ve been extremely satisfied with this dash cam. I love the small size and the way it attaches magnetically. So easy to attach and remove. I took my car to the dealer for servicing the other day and the service advisor said they don\u2019t allow dash cams to be on in the service area. I just reached up and pulled mine off so easily. The service advisor asked me what brand it was because he\u2019d never seen one so easily removed. The clarity of the recordings is excellent. I like the ability to connect it to my cell phone and the Vantrue program for Windows is excellent. Using that program displays not only your video but your speed and location on a map. I do not have the dash cam hard-wired. I've found no negatives regarding this dash cam. I\u2019m so glad I purchased this brand and model.",
