This unit is great, clear instuctions, easy set up and a large sd card. Really like the screen saver feature that blanks out the sceen while displaying a recording indicator. Pulled the card last night and checked a few files - clear recordings.Ger a dash cam. I was rear ended and even with my camera facing forward....I was able to prove to the insurance co that I held my lane for 5 minutes prior to the crash. The 17 year old that hit me gave a rexcorded statement that I was cutting in and out of traffic....leaving him no choice when I cut in front of him and stopped. The camera proved different ......I sent the file to the adjustor and 10 minutes later they declared the 17 year old 100% at fault.",

I believe it will work well for me and highly recommend it to anyone needing a low-cost dash-cam.I did have a problem powering the camera; They supply a very long power cord with a lighter plug fix attached. Problem is my new truck doesn't have any lighter outlets. (They are being phased out.) It does have lots of USB connectors, both Type A and Type C. The supplied USB cord is too short to reach anywhere and suffers from the problem outlined below. I used a longer cable with the correct connector. The truck sees a USB device and wants to connect to it. The Camera obliges but only as a camera or mass storage device. I don't want either mode. I want a dash-cam. There appears to be no way to turn data transfer off in the camera setup. I had to resolve the issue by using a USB cable that only had power wires and no data wires. That worked just fine. I believe this camera will serve me very well.",

The camera comes with everything you see in the picture.An added bonus is the usb port on the back of the car power adaptor for the dash cam, so you have a port for charging your phones. the cable is plenty long enough for hiding and running along the car headliner and trim so not cable is dangling in your windshield view. it also provide a 64GB SD card.All in all a great little camera that you deserve to own.",

                "reviewText": "Did not expect to see a lot of extras in the package to help make the installation of the camera power cord easier. Nice stick adhesive, multiple mounting bracket. Simple to operate once you get the hang of the menu buttons. Read the manual, it will help out a bit. Great camera for the price you pay. Quality is as expected, I just need something for the insurance company so they cant just go 50/50 fault or blaming me for causing the accident.",

Only bad thing I can think of is trying to \"hide\" the wire when I mount it on the windshield, but I'm the only one driving so I don't care.",

Excellent to keep on the windshield and does not interfere with the view of the road. I recommend this camera for purchase!",
