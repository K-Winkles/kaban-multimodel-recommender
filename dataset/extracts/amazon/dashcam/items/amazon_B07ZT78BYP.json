                "reviewText": "I just received the COOAU Dashcam D30S and so far it's performed exactly as stated...I installed it on my 2021 GMC Sierra, just to the left and slightly behind the rear view mirror, using using the GM taped mounting bracket. The suction cup mounting bracket seems to work well, however I wanted to use the lower profile one.I plugged the dash cam into the USB port instead of the 12v adapter port (GMC Sierra's 12v adapter port is always on unless you move a 50 amp fuse). Upon turning it on I found the menu was easy to navigate and quickly set the dash cam up.I installed the Ficam app on my phone and was able to quickly connect to the dash cam's Wi-Fi. I did notice that if you want to use the app outside the vehicle you will have to disconnect the dash cam and reconnect it to a micro USB (close to your phone) whenever you want to use the app. I can understand this as the dash cam has to be on when downloading video to the app.GPS seems to work okay, however I have noticed that when sitting still, especially inside a garage, the display sometimes shows that the vehicle is moving approximately 1 mph.So far the video looks very good on the small viewing screen and through the app. I've only had it installed for a day and have not used it a lot, so time will tell.The bright blue power and blinking red recording light are a little bit annoying when it is dark, however a small piece of electricians tape can take care of that. There's still a red dot on the screen that blinks when they dash cam is recording.I did not want to hardwire the dash cam to my vehicle at this time, as you need to purchase the wiring separately, so I guess it will not be using the parking mode (maybe at a later date).Pros:... Small profile... Easy to install with various options... Accepts up to 256 GB micro SD... Both cameras have good video... Can record front of vehicle, inside vehicle or both... View screen can show front of vehicle, inside vehicle, PIIP front of vehicle main or PIIP inside vehicle main... View screen can be set to turn off or go into screensaver mode... Navigation through the settings is very easyCons:... Blue power light and red blinking recording light are bright and annoying... Wiring harness to hardwire and be able to use parking mode has to be purchased separately... No internal battery, which would be nice to keep from having to hardwire dash cam to vehicle",

                "reviewText": "This was a nice camera at an excellent price. I wanted both front and rear facing cameras but didn't want to run a second camera to the back. This has front and rear cameras on the same unit so it records in front of the camera through the windshield and out the back. I have a pickup truck so that setup works perfectly. I also got a little power cable that uses the power supply on the back of my rear view mirror for power so I didn't have to run any wires to the fuse box or anything! That came from Dongar Technologies. They have them for several vehicles so if you get this dashcam (or any dashcam), check that out to see if one of those cables is compatible because it makes the installation tons easier. For me, I think it took only five minutes to install.The app is easy to use, as well. We have cameras in our other vehicles that are okay but the software/app can be clunky. This app is better than the others we have. I definitely recommend this camera as it's outstanding for any sub-$200 dual camera I could find. The quality is great and it's easy to use.",

                "reviewText": "This dashcam fails for at least 4 major reasons:1.the online description states in red highlight a \"64 GB SD Card included\" - but the box contained no SD card, worse yet there is no warning until you go to the online user manual that normal SD cards will not work - the manual online provides the specs for a more expensive SD card than the normal SanDisk Ultra class 10 that my other dash cams use and that I have handy2.the power cord plug that goes into the cigarette lighter outlet does not have a usb port to also charge your phone in the car - the dash cam hogs the whole thing, unlike other manufacturers that design that as standard3.the settings menu is impossible to get to once you put an SD card in - the unit starts recording and does not allow you into settings, so you have to take out the SD card and set up the unit like the first time if you ever want to change a setting4the Ficam app to use the wifi features is rated \"3.2\" on the PlayStore and the most recent reviews say it is full of glitches and causes many problems on phones it is used on - so definitely do not use - which makes this dashcam mostly useless.Strongly do no not this manufacturer or the COOAU Dash Cam D30.",
