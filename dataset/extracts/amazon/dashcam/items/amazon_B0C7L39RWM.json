                "reviewText": "I did a lot research on Dash Cams before I made my purchase. I realized that I did not want features I'd never need or use, nor did I want or need the LCD Screen showing me what was being recorded. I wanted a compact Dash Cam that did not obstruct my vision and was Plug and Play simple to use, but with high enough resolution to read license plates. I decided on this Dash Cam and I made a great choice. It comes with a 64 gig micro SD card already installed. Setup was fairly easy and straight forward. I installed the Dash Cam on the windshield right behind my rear view mirror and took my time hiding the power cable where the headliner meets the windshield upper trim and over to down the the support arm, then under the passenger glove box dash area to the central cigarette lighter 12v power outlet. From inside my Sonata, you can't see the Dash Cam or any wires at all. From the outside, you have to look really close to see the Dash Cam because it visually blends in with the rear view mirror right behind the cam. It's been installed for a week now and it works great. the recorded videos are viewed on my phone. I have an iPhone and the setup and operation of the Cam was problem free. When I start the car, a voice prompt tells me its working. When I stop and turn off my engine, a voice prompt tells me its shutting down. I have more piece of mind driving now that it is installed. My girlfriend and my buddy both want me to install the same Dash Cam in their vehicles. Maybe I did too good a job installing it in my car. LOLI highly recommend this Dash Cam if you're looking for compact, simple and high resolution.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This dash Cam offers high-resolution recording and comprehensive coverage for a reliable and safe driving experience. License plates are some what readable if paused and zoomed in but just like most dashcams, not the best. One of the standout features of this dash cam is its WiFi connectivity, allowing seamless connection to your smartphone via the mobile app. This feature enables you to watch and download recorded videos and photos directly to your phone. Also, no need to constantly update the date/time stamp like other dashcams as it pulls the information from your smartphone.With its compact design, the 4K dash cam can be conveniently hidden behind the rearview mirror without obstructing your vision. Installation is simplified, and users can easily set it up using the detailed instructions provided. However, wifi only works with the car charger and does not work when connected to a PC usb port. Night mode was briefly tested and captures surrounding traffic details.Comes with a 64gb SD card worth at least a 1/3 of the cost of the dashcam, which is a huge plus! Overall, tested the dash cam for 2 hours (gets warm in temperatures over 35 degrees C but nothing unexpected and has a supercapacitor so less prone to explosion) and it combines high-resolution recording, convenient smartphone connectivity, average night vision, and reliable functionality. Well worth the price if you are searching for a minimalistic design and specifically great in cars with smaller wind shields.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the DashCam Pro, and I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance. This little device has exceeded my expectations in every way. The video quality is outstanding, capturing crisp and clear footage even in low-light conditions. It's like having a reliable witness on the road, providing me with peace of mind knowing that I have evidence in case of any unexpected incidents.Setting up the DashCam was a breeze, and the user-friendly interface makes it simple to navigate through the settings and recordings. The loop recording feature ensures that I never run out of storage space, and the automatic collision detection is a real lifesaver. I appreciate how seamlessly it integrates into my car's interior, without obstructing my view. Overall, the DashCam Pro has proven to be an invaluable addition to my daily commute, offering safety, security, and convenience all in one package.",

                "reviewText": "So I liked this dash cam because is not as expensive but gets the work done. It can be annoying sometimes because every time I turn the car, it would say something and it can be annoying. But I liked how it records and that you can access through your phone. I have another dash cam that was more expensive, and this one kinda resembles it since it has the same functions. I highly recommend this dash cam if your car is not as expensive but still want to record in case of an accident. It is very affordable and decent quality. It already comes with a SD card, which is awesome! It is pretty easy to set up so no need to worry about that either :)",
