                "reviewText": "Easy install. I like how the rear facing camera has a mount that pivots. It can be placed with either double side tape or screws. I purchased this model because it utilizes an app to view video files from the cam so that the SD card doesn't have to be ejected to view. The camera is small and hardly noticeable. Fits nicely between the windshield and the rear view mirror. I am very pleased with this product. I plan on purchasing another for my wife's vehicle. Definitely a great buy!",
