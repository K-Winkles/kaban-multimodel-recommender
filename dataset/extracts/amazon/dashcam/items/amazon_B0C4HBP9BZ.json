Pictures are really clear. A great value for the price.I have it for a few months and still working without a problem. Love this dash cam.",

I have a Toyota Tacoma, so I chose to mount the camera on the back window, didn't feel like spending a lot of time under the truck besides there is a backup camera installed already. I ran the cable from the rear cam under the plastic floor panels on the door frame. Front cam, tucked the cables into the space between the window and roof then down the door frame (another plastic panel) and behind the glove compartment. only 2 complaints, in the description of included parts some paragraphs state a 64 gig SD card included (not a big deal). Bigger deal: included is a second suction cup for the back cam. There was no way I could see to attach the rear cam to the suction cup.I had to drill out the mounting plate on the rear cam a little then attach with a small nut, the thumbscrew would not fit. Overall, a good deal for $50.00",

                "reviewText": "My only real 'issue' is the attachment point to the windshield suction cup bracket.. its a small screw on thread, so if you want to detach the camera you have to physically unscrew the unit and be very careful not to drop it as it comes off the last thread. Or you can release the suction cup from the glass, but I prefer to leave the mount in place. A clip/slide on style would be better here in my opinion.Otherwise, it functions as it should. I'm happy with the video quality and even the sound it picks up inside the passenger cabin. Unit is mostly user friendly, and I had no issues with install and initial setup. You simply run a wire, plug it in, follow instructions to format the included memory card, and it's working. Even plugging into a pc was simple; it was recognized right away as a usb mass storage unit, and I can easily save/view the video clips onto my computer.One thing to note, I haven't installed the rear cam yet, but I had to order an extension cable separately for that because I drive a full cab/long box truck and the wires it comes with are not nearly long enough to get to the back.Good product overall, works great, well worth the money.",
