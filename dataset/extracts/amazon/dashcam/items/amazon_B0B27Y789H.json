A: Check whether the TF card has enough space and is locked. Q: Can't charge? A: The normal dash recorder has a built-in battery, which can be used for 3-5 minutes in an emergency. Because the battery will be exhausted during transportation, it needs to be charged for a period of time after receiving the recorder before it can be started. If it still cannot be turned on, then the car charger is probably damaged. Q: Why is the card full after a few days of use? A: You need to check whether the G-Sensor, Parking Monitor and Motion Detection functions are turned on, because the videos recorded by these three functions cannot be automatically overwritten. Q: Why does the rear camera not display and have no image? A: The reversing camera needs to be connected well before the power is turned on. It is recommended to insert it several times. There may be burrs in the production process, which may cause poor contact.",

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY...After speaking to someone from their customer service department, she said she would issue a full fund but, I have to forward the refund email to their finance department, someone from that department replied to me saying they would be happy to issue the refund if I removed the negative rating I gave the dashcam to a 5 star. Rating....my only regret is that I didn't screen shot the email .for some strange reason the email dissapeared and the finance department stop responding to my emails....",
