                "reviewText": "We live in So. FL where traffic is high and drivers... well, let's just say they drive erratically. I had an older device in my wife's vehicle that seemed to have a bad power source wiring causing the camera to glitch and constantly restart. I labored at what to buy and did hours of research and narrowed my choice down to Pelsee, a brand I've come to admire. As video attachment examples cause large file sizes (not my thing to deal with uploading ) I settled for images but trust me, the playback on one's phone or PC, the resolutions are very crisp and detailed indeed. It's 2K/1080P is really all you need in this fine camera. Honestly.Every manufacturer brags about theirs being able to clearly read license plates but not all do as I've owned 2 different brands before and it was debatable. Pelsee however does and exceptionally well! I guess I was looking something unobtrusive and user-friendly with not too many buttons for my wife to have to press or complicated menus. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT an entry level camera, but rather a slick, modern, and quite sophisticated device, which I wish I knew existed and bought before. It is absolutely a delight for my wife to use... Plug and play. Upon engine start it announces it is recording and does it's job. It sits right in front of the rear view mirror and one thing she insisted on was that it not be distracting. The samll footprint is hardly noticeable but a must-have. It can turn off the LCD screen but since I drive the vehicle too, I like to see it.A magnificent feature is the ability to pair one's BT phone and see not just recorded files, but real time if you want to put your phone in a holder and view it. A feature request I might add is if the phone app could pinch to zoom but you can always increase the magnification if the file is downloaded to a PC. The device does not get hot which I am pleasantly surprised with given the narrow size. Any heat disipates almost immediately. It feels solidly made, qualitative and if my wife is happy, so am I! Thank you Pelsee.",

After I received it and tested the product, I was so surprised that the quality was higher than I expected. The front camera image is crystal clear, and the back camera is very good as well. Installation is a piece of cake; it only took me about 15 minutes to get it done. Night vision is acceptable, the simple smart voice control works great, and you don\u2019t have to push the dash cam button to take a photo, stop, start recording, or lock the video. Overall, excellent dash cam for this price range.",

                "reviewText": "Pulled the trigger on this dash cam about two weeks ago, and it's been a game-changer for my daily commute to work. The dual front and rear cameras capture crisp footage, and I love the flexibility to switch between 4K for the front and 2K/1080P combo. I've fitted both to my car. Whenever I need 4K, I unplug the rear camera. The hands-free voice control is a handy touch, making it easy to manage recordings without fumbling with buttons whilst driving. The built-in Wi-Fi and app control add a modern twist, letting me quickly access and share footage straight from my phone. The night vision is surprisingly sharp, and the 24-hour parking mode provides peace of mind. While the dash cam has impressed me in many aspects, one drawback I've noticed is the rather small 1.5-inch display. It's a bit on the compact side, making it a tad challenging to navigate settings or review footage directly on the device. However, the app control feature somewhat compensates for this limitation, allowing for more convenient management through a smartphone. Overall, it's a reliable, user-friendly dash cam that ticks all the right boxes.",
