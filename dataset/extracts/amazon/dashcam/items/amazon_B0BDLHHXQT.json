                "reviewText": "This isn't a bad dash cam. It is by no means crystal clear or the best one out there (720P model), but it's proficient for a basic dashcam. The suction cup mount has been good. I've had no issue with it falling off or coming loose, so I like that it stays in one position securely. What's nice is that it turns on and off with you car when connected to a 12v power source or usb port. I prefer to keep the cable hidden, so you may have to some maneuvering to cover it up, but the cable is long. Picture quality is basic and not the clearest at times, but it's enough to provide some peace of mind in most situations. Only short duration recording times, so I can't see how a bigger SD card would make a difference if it just loops after 5 minutes.",

It only took a couple of minutes to set up date/time, license plate number and recording resolution. The camera does require constant power via a cigarette lighter, not just a battery charge. I was concerned that the cord wouldn\u2019t be long enough and that it would be an eye sore. Im happy to report that routing the cable only took about 10 minutes. You can see it where it plugs into the camera and at the other end into the cigarette lighter outlet. I was easily able to get it under the mirror cover, headliner, down the A-pillar, through the paneling, glove box and the center console. The few pics are included are to illustrate this point, not just random pics of car angles. The camera mounts firmly, without any movement, slippage or dismount. I like how easy it is to unplug, then slide the camera for easy removal. It\u2019s great that a micro USB card is included. It may be small at only 4GB, but it will get you going right out of the box, with the ability to upgrade to a 32GB of storage. Im impressed with the large field of view, capturing everything in sight. It\u2019s actually larger than what is show in my video, because I cropped the bottom out to remove the license plate number.Unfortunately, that\u2019s where the positives stop. I recorded at 1920x1080, or what is commonly known as Full HD. The video is grainy and jittery. You can see in my video the Camaro that passes me on the right has a glitchy motion. It candle handle any amount of glare. I was unable to use anything where I was driving into the sun. Even driving away from the sun, you can NOT see that the license plate on the car in front of me. It was only a matter of a few feet and stopped at a light. Audio is cheap. This one recorded without sound altogether, but that was most likely me hitting something in the settings, because it does have audio. i also experienced several recording failures. The camera can be removed from your vehicle and plugged into a computers USB port for file transfer. 8 out of 28 files were corrupted and would not play. That is the error message pic that I have posted.What does all this add up to? If you\u2019re in an accident you\u2019ll be able to tell what cars were where and who did what, provided they\u2019re within the field of view. Could you make out a license plate? Probably not. If someone vandalized your vehicle, you *might* be able to get a good enough recording for identification. All that IF they video file itself doesn\u2019t fail. As much as I wanted to love this, I do not, nor can I recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Everything seems to be working well, we haven\u2019t had to really use it for anything like an accident or what not but it does keep recording and the screen goes blank after 5 minutes so it\u2019s not distracting the driver, which is nice. My only complaint is the instruction manual. It\u2019s could definitely be written in a more user friendly way bc it is a bit confusing. You will need to read and go through it a few times and keep it handy until you\u2019re used to everything on the camera and how to use it. Picture quality is okay, I mean it\u2019s not 4K but it\u2019s also not horrible either. I think it will be fine if the time ever came to have to use it and have evidence. I pray to God I never need it. Worth the money. Easy to install in the car, but you will need to use some kind of tape to keep the wiring up out of the way and ran along the seams of your car to the lighter outlet so there isn\u2019t cord in your way. My husband did a great job hiding the wire for 90% of the cord length but in the picture I posted you can see the one spot he had to use tape. I don\u2019t mind though. The suction power is great and it has stayed on the windshield so far (have had it up about 4 weeks) Overall I think the price is worth it and it gives me peace of mind knowing I have it bc people drive like idiots these days!",

I love that it already comes with a Micro SD card inserted, and you can transfer recordings and pictures onto your computer very easily. It stores everything in a gallery and is very easy to navigate. The suction is very firm and I'm confident that it will stay on the glass effectively. It turns on automatically and begins to record when the car ignition is turned over. You can stop recording with a push of a button and turn it off just as easy if you don't want to use it. The view can be changed by rotating the cam, and the resolution is decent. Low price for a good quality dash cam.",
