                "reviewText": "This dash cam has phenomenal picture quality, even at night, which is impressive given that it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I am also impressed by the wide field the camera captures. It's a breeze to install, even for someone like me who isn't the most tech savvy person in the world. Because it's so small, I can barely tell it's attached to my windshield - My rear view mirror almost completely blocks it from my view, so it's definitely not a distraction. Despite its small size, I was able to use the various buttons without any issues, and I found the settings to be intuitive and very easy to navigate. Be aware that you will need to buy an SD card - I purchased one with 256 GB of memory, which allowed me to set my camera to the highest quality picture resolution without having to worry about running out of memory too quickly. Overall, I am very pleased with this dash cam!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Easy to setup, easy to use, impressive video quality for dash cam",
                "reviewText": "Pros: - Setup was a breeze, much easier than my other camera. - Camera can be fully configured via Wi-Fi. All of the options on the camera exist in the app. - Wi-Fi can be disabled for security reasons and re-enabled later. - Camera is extremely responsive. You can watch a live feed and it's even faster than my home surveillance system. - Camera quality is surprisingly good. It looks like a professional grade video you would expect to see on a business vehicle. I think this is the most surprising feature. - Audio recording can be disabled. - Watermarks/speed/date can be disabled from video. - Screen can be turned off with a single button press. - Buttons are sturdy, easy to press, and the menus actually make sense. - Not broken English! - You can take a still picture, and also activate an emergency recording which cannot be deleted. - Recordings can be played through the app without having to remove the SD card from the camera.Cons: - Daylight Savings Time (DST) is not supported, but most dash cams don't anyway - Wi-Fi password is shown by pressing Wi-Fi information option, which is insecure, although you can disable Wi-Fi and re-enable it when needed - You have to create an account the use the app, although it just takes a minute - Timezone is not staying set. It continues to revert back to GMT -4, although this doesn't matter because the time is kept correctly. Contacted support about this issue. - Support bubble in the app cannot be turned off, although this did make contacting support extremely easy and you can drag the bubble to a corner. - Green LED flashes when recording. The green LED is not distracting at all, and you likely will not notice it unless you are looking at the camera. - Camera files are saved in .TS format which is actually MPEG-2. Quality is fine, but most people aren't familiar with .TS format. Files can be converted with third-party software. The file format won't matter unless you're trying to share files, then the other person may need VLC player or similar to play unless the file is converted.Overall thoughts: - I really love this dash cam. Definitely better than the other one I purchased a few years ago, which was actually more back then! - The quality is outstanding for the price. Even at night. Others mentioned you could read license plates, but I found you could only read license plates if the vehicle was directly in front of you. It was not able to see the characters on plates in a parking lot. - I would purchase and recommend this camera to others. What I love is that you can configure everything from the app. No need to fiddle with buttons. - I also love that you can watch your dash cam live, and play back videos on your phone without having to remove the SD card. I wish that videos were in MP4/MKV format, but those can easily be converted with ffmpeg on the computer or various apps on mobile. - Saved files can be played through the app without having to remove SD card. This is a lifesaver. With my previous dash cam I had to remove the SD card and use a special adapter on my phone to play them. With this one I just turn on Wi-Fi, connect the app, and instantly play the files.",

Installing and setting up this dashcam was very easy and straightforward. And because it came with a long cable, I didn\u2019t have any issues mounting it to my windshield. This dash cam captures high quality footage, ensuring no details are missed with its wide angle lens even during the night time. With that said, I loved this dash cam and I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a inexpensive high quality camera to document their journeys, then this dashcam would be prefect for you.",

Video is crystal clear and covers a wide path. I was actually very impressed with video play back,better than the more expensive one in my other vehicle. Overall I am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a small ,inexpensive dash cam !",

                "reviewText": "This camera is small which makes it easy to install wherever you need it. The one important thing to consider is the power cable... the power cable this comes with is very long which is nice but if you want to ensure that the installation is clean and doesn't have any wires hanging, you will need to put some effort into that process. Regular use is easy, the camera starts recording as soon as it gets power and records a file at the interval determined in the settings. Once that interval is reached, a new file is created. The files stay on the SD card until the card is full and then new footage overwrites old footage. If you have the additional accessory power kit, you can have this camera record while you are parked, activate on motion or take periodic photos depending on how the settings are configured.I had an incident last winter where a large sheet of ice flew off of the SUV in front of me while we were on the highway. It was impossible to avoid and it hit my windshield causing serious damage. We were able to exchange information with the person but when it came time to get insurance involved, the other driver denied responsibility. If we had a dashcam, we would have been able to prove the situation and our repair costs would have been paid for. I can tell you the repair costs were greater than the cost of the camera... well worth installing and this camera is a good model to use",
