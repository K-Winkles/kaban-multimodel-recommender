                "reviewText": "This 70mai Dash Cam \u2018Lite\u2019 is very easy to use and is offered at reduced prices.Pluses:1. CAM will store about 4-8 day\u2019s of driving video\u2019s on a 64GB Micro SD card (about 10hrs of video recordings). Older files will be automatically overwritten. Individual photos can also be generated on demand. User has to supply the SD Card. Files have user-friendly date/time names and are arranged in well-named folders.2. Video quality is good for both day and night conditions. Can read license plates at 1-2 car length distances.3. User friendly features and software including Audio alerts and announcements: The CAM generates a WiFi HotSpot and connects to your smartphone \u201870mai\u2019 App where you can get real-time video, download/playback photos & videos, etc.Issues:1. Don\u2019t use the \u2018Electrostatic\u2019 Sticker; it will hold for only a few hours even after carefully wetting the mating surface with the windshield with window cleaner. Attach the unit directly to the windshield with the supplied sticker.2. At first use, Low battery warnings occurred when vehicle was powered off. I connected the USB power plug into a USB Power Bank overnight while the CAM was in \u2018Parking Surveillance\u2019 mode to resolve this (I assume the new unit needed time to fully charge the internal battery).3. Tiny paper manual is useless. The online manual is much better.4. The video files take several minutes to download via Wifi to your phone. It is much faster to download from the Micro SD card to a computer via a SD reader.The details:When the car\u2019s USB or Power port is active, the camera starts recording and will store in 1, 2 or 3 minute sequential clips. Each file has a date/time label. Three minute files are about 300MB large.When power source is stopped, the unit uses it\u2019s internal battery to stop and store. If parking mode is enabled, the unit will automatically generate a new video if there is movement in the camera field. It is also supposed to record if the built-in accelerometer detects a collision/bump. The battery has about 30minutes capacity. Typical power consumption was about 0.8Amps at 5V. The camera will power-off if there is no movement detected for 30minutes (this ensures that the car battery is not drained if the car\u2019s Power Source is always on).",

                "reviewText": "I bought this new 70mai Dash Cam Lite and two SanDisk High Endurance 64GB microSDXC cards on October 11, 2023 as a gift.When setting up the dash cam today (Friday, Nov. 24) first time, it failed to format either one of the SD cards and cannot recognize any known good C10/U3-rated SD cards but keeps saying \"The SD card is damaged. Please change the SD card to continue recording.\"I tried their Customer Service USA phone number listed on their website but that number was not working at all (yes I was calling within their business hours), so then I submitted a message on their website and am waiting for a response.By the way, I know it's my negligence that I should have tested the device (ANY Newly Ordered Devices, to be precisely) within 30 days in case it's a DOA. So now in this case I am hoping to get a replacement from 70mai. Lesson is learned and remembered! However, I have another Dash Cam Lite of the same model that was bought last year and it's working with the new SD cards. So the problem is not on the SD cards.* Update - On Nov 28, 2023, I received the odd reply from 70mai Customer Service and it reads:Thank you for getting back to us.Could you please try another brand sd card?Like Samsung. We recommend using Samsung EVO Plus U3 if you don\u2019t have anything in mind.I checked Amazon website and 70mai website, and nowhere they mentioned anything about using the \"preferred\" Samsung SD card for their dash cam. Isn't the SanDisk High Endurance microSDXC card C10/U3 100 MB/s READ and 40 MB/s WRITE good enough??? Their response just doesn't feel right! Besides, I already told the Customer Service that my old Dash Cam Lite (bought in 2022) works fine with these SanDisk SD cards without any issues.* Update - On Nov 29, 2023, after emailing back and forth with 70mai Support and providing them with photos of this DOA device and Amazon invoice, I received even odd and contradictory replies from them -JL: I bought it at Amazon.com just last month (October 11, 2023) and Amazon's Customer Service pointed me to you / 70mai Support because it is under 70mai's one-year warranty. Attached PDF is the Amazon invoice for my order.70mai Support: I checked that warranty of your order has expired. Hope you could understand.JL: No, I don't understand. How long is your warranty for Dash Cam Lite?70mai Support: one year limitedI am so speechless now. Just unbelievable! Is 70mai a trust-worthy company? Is 70mai qualified to continue selling products at Amazon? What else can a consumer like me do?* Update - Late on Nov 29, 2023, after questioning the 70mai Support why my order date \"October 11, 2023\" is beyond their One-Year Limited support, I received this reply:70mai Support: Okay,sorry my bad. i thought it was 2022.Ok, I think I have mentioned at least 5 times throughout my communications with them that I bought it just last month, October 11, 2023. So, I am speechless again.Final update - On Nov 30, 2023, the Support agreed to arrange a replacement. I asked for the tracking number and the Support replied saying they will send it over once they have it. I NEVER received the tracking number BUT received the replacement itself on Dec 2 which formatted the SanDisk High Endurance C10/U3 microSD cards just fine. Oh well, at least I got a replacement that was working out of the box.* My suggestion is: if you have a 70mai dash cam that should fail within a year, then you certainly have the rights to request a replacement, but better be firm and prepared to spend some time for emailing back and forth with their Support.",

You can\u2019t silence the audio messages. If you start an emergency recording, you can\u2019t stop it until it times out. It seems to have a remarkably weak back up battery because regularly reminds you to plug into power. While driving one day, it randomly when into parking surveillance mode.",
