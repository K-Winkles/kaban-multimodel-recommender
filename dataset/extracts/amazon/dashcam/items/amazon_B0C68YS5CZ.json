            "Upgraded Version Dash Cam Hardwire Kit: The hardwire kit is the 15A Mini-type fuse. Attach the red cable to ACC, the yellow cable to BATT, and the black cable to GND(the vehicle's metal part). Please make sure your car's fuse type is matched.",
            "Low Voltage Protection: Comes with a sensitive voltage sensing switch, which will monitor the car battery voltage in real time. Once the voltage is lower than 11.7V or 23.7V, it will cut the power supply, leaving enough power to ignite the engine.",
            "Compatible 12V\u201324V Vehicles: The hardwire kit connects the dash camera directly to the car, truck, SUVs, etc., for continuous power, and accepts voltage from any type of vehicle that runs on 12V\u201324V.",
            "Easy Installation: The Hardwire Kit is 3.5 meters. Simple hidden wiring keeps the car neat and tidy and releases the cigarette lighter for connecting to more devices. Suitable for most Dash Cam GPS, and Mirror cam(USB-C Interface).",
            "Compatibility: This hardwire kit is compatible with most dash cams or other device on the market. We still recommend that you inquire if your device is compatible with it before purchasing!",
            "Warm Tips: Please make sure your dash cam supports parking mode. We suggest you test the hardwire kit before using it. When connecting the hardwire kit, please make sure that the engine is off. If you are unsure of the circuit system we advise that you hire a professional to do it."

This hardwire kit is compatible with most dash cams or other device on the market. We still recommend that you inquire if your device is compatible with it before purchasing! No need for extra cable from the car cigarette lighter socket, replace it with a permanent hidden cable. Works with most dash cams!

Q1: Why can't the dash cam be activated by inserting the red line(ACC) alone? Answer: The red line(ACC) is a signal line, and the yellow line(BAT) is the power line. When you plug in the yellow line(BAT), it can boot directly. However, if only the connected yellow line(BAT), the car's battery will be damaged. Q2: Why do I need the red line(ACC)? Answer: The red line(ACC) is a signal line. When the yellow line(BAT) is connected to the battery for parking monitoring or motion detection, if the battery voltage is lower than 11.7V, the driving recorder will automatically shut down. If you don't connect the red line(ACC), it can't detect the signal that you have switched on your car, the hard wire kit chipset will stop outputting current, and the driving recorder will not be able to start. Therefore, the red line(ACC) is for signal detection, and it must be connected in the car together with the horizontal yellow line(BAT) and the black line(GND).",
