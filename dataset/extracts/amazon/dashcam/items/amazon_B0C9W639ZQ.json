                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a car 12v phone charger with dual USB-A ports (One is QC3 capable, the other is just 5 volts at 2.4 amps). It also has a 6.5 foot USB-C 90 degree plug cable that is permanently attached to the bottom designed to power a USB-C powered dashcam.There is a small blue LED light inside that illuminates the inside of the ports so you can see them to plug in at night (and also escapes through the seam of the plug where it is not fully flush).It includes two user replaceable fuses, which you shouldn't need (I mean, if the USB charger is limiting power draw properly, it should never blow the fuse) but is a nice safety feature in case something goes wrong with the USB charger.Pros: Low cost. Easy install.Cons: 6.5' cable is not long enough to route under the dash and around the door and across the roof to the dashcam, it just goes straight up. The two USB-A ports provide enough power to charge your phone(s) at 10 watts, but unless you have a QC3 capable phone it does not support \"rapid\" charging.",
