                "reviewText": "Out of the 16 mounts, only one of them works with the Yi Nightscape. At first try I thought none of them worked, but the one in the middle in the picture I attached is the one that will fit in the Yi Nightscape's mount hole. The mount that fit is about the same size and shape as the original Yi Nightscape ball mount.Pros:- 16 different mounts in case you buy a different dashcam in the future.- Suction strength is pretty good. I didn't use the alcohol wipes that came with it, instead I wiped the windshield glass with paper and added a few drops of water to the suction cup before pressing it to the glass.- Comes with 2 suction cups and 2 sticky pads in case you don't want to use the suction. I only used the cups though because of their reusability.Cons:- Plastic bag and the mounts have a strong chemical plastic smell. I had to pour them on the floor and let them air out before touching them.Overall, it's worth the money to be able to move your dashcam around the windshield however you like and not be stuck with the \"permanent\" mounts that came only with your dashcam.",

                "reviewText": "If your car dash camera connector broke and or the suction fitting has lost its mojo, then this kit maybe just what the doctor ordered. It has a bunch of different fitting mounts to fit as a replacement for various car dash cam designs.I have a good camera but the original mount broke. I could not find the same brand here on Amazon. I ordered this kit and found that came with an equivalent mount to install my window (rear window) can on my SUV. It came with two suction mounts and there is also a tape mount if you prefer that rather than suction.Very pleased. It was easy and inexpensive, it sure beats buying a whole new camera system.FYI - My dash cam on the rear window has a silver colored ring around the lens that faces out towards rear window and cars. The silver reflective surface makes that camera more visible behind the rear tinted windows. This way cars see that you have a camera facing them. I believe it provides me peace of mind with good video and also \"informs\" other drivers at my rear to \"smile, you are on Candid Camera\" ( and to please not tailgate, etc).Drive safe and take care.",
