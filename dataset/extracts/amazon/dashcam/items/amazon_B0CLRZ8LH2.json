                "reviewText": "I was surprised how good the quality of its photos and videos are. This is the first dash cam I have bought . It meets my expectations of a dash camera perfectly. However, the instruction manual was not comprehensive and I asked Gloryes customer service team to get the complete instructions on how to operate it. They are very professional and patient and will do their best to solve my problem! Thanks again!Clear videosThis dash cam takes videos at 1080p resolution and you can see the front licence plate very clearly during the day and at night. The rear camera is also clearer and works fine in the rain.Easy to operateConnects to power and automatically turns on to record video.1.Press the power off button to pause recording.M button to enter the setting interface, up and down button to select, power off button to confirm.2.Pause the recording, long press the M button to enter the photo mode. In photo mode, long press the M button to enter the video playback interface.3. Under the pause recording situation, press up and down key to switch the combination of shooting lenses. If you have all three lenses installed, there will be 4 combination forms here, Front Camera, Front+Rear, Front+Inside, Picture in Picture (taken by three cameras)4. After a minute of automatically recording video it will go into screen saver mode, this can be done in two ways, one is a completely black screen and the other is a screen saver mode that keeps time. If you don't want to use the screen saver feature, you can go to settings and find screensaver and select off.Simple and compactThis dash cam is relatively small and fits nicely in my car not blocking the view at all. It's really friendly to first time car camera buyers like me. The buttons are on the right side which is also nice to operate. My friend's car recorder has the buttons on the side and she doesn't find it as easy to operate as mine.Mirroring functionTheir customer service team also provided me with updated software to flip the video horizontally as my request.Overall, I am very happy with this camera and think it is a great value for money.",

                "reviewText": "It turned out to be a very decent product for the money paid: pretty compact, easy to install, and quite high-quality video (well, it is noticeably better during daylight hours but even at night it is acceptable).The best - it's a complete kit, which includes a 32GB SD card and rearview camera so I could install it all at once and forget about wasting more time shopping. Also for the rear camera, I recommend having a professional and electrical automotive worker do the work for you.We'll see how it will behave in the future and how long it will last - but as for now, considering the price, recommended as an amazing bang for the buck!",

                "reviewText": "This camera is about what I expected it to be for the price. That's not a terrible thing but there's definite room for improvement. This is a somewhat rudimentary dashcam with features you'd expect - records from a forward facing camera, rear facing camera and an optional back up camera. I didn't install the backup camera as I didn't want to drill a hole through the back of my car. This comes with a micro-SD card, the camera, short and long power cords, backup camera and attached cabling. It also has a mount with double-side tape and anti-static stickers to mount in a more permanent fashion as well as a suction cup mount. I used the suction cup mount and mounted it toward the top & center of my windshield, then used the provided tool to hide the long power cable behind the trim, along the windshield and while some of it sticks out across the dash... it's still a fairly clean install. Once I turned it on, there are a few things to set up - language, date, time, etc... Once I was done with that, I turned it off. I started my car and it powered back up and almost immediately started recording. After a few adjustments to how the camera was sitting, I was off and drove around my block to test it out. The video was clear and really does have a wide angle on the front and rear-facing cameras. It captured oncoming traffic and was able to see vehicles and people on the side of the road. It probably goes without saying but records audio, as well.So, yes, it does everything I expected it to and seems to do it well. I gave a 4 star review for the simple reason there could have been a few simple things added to improve it. First - no micro-SD card adapter so if you want to play back or transfer any of the recorded files you will have to find an adapter. Also, the adjustments for angle off the mount could be finer; it kind of locks itself in to a slots that have a lot of room in between where the camera would be perfect but as it sits, it's just okay. Lastly, the keys are very small and it's difficult to see what you're pressing from the driver's seat. It almost makes you remove the camera from the mount in order to change settings or play back a file. Otherwise, it's fine and will serve the purpose for which it was designed. I like it and if someone were looking for an inexpensive dashcam, I'd recommend this one but make sure you have a microSD adapter and some patience for the installation and usage.",

It looks great mounted on the windshield and is very minimalistic (doesn't distract from driving). Formatting the SD card is a little tricky but once you get it formatted on the camera and your PC, you'll be good to go.Excellent picture quality. Plus we have fun when on a road trip going back and looking at part of the drive. It's pretty cool to see. I don't normally save them, unless there was something we wanted to see again.All in all, it's a great system and perfect for someone who is installing a dash cam for the first time.",
