                "reviewText": "It has a wide assortment of video resolutions you can choose from. I went with \"standard\" high definition, rather than \"2160\" 4k recording. This should be able to get over 24 hours of recording time on my 256gb card. This should be more than adequate to capture what is happening should I need it for whatever reason and the SD card will last longer than if I recorded at higher resolutions.Set-up was VERY easy, logical and intuitive. Screen is larger and very bright. Suction cup works very well, very secure. I did not use the self adhesive mounting, since the suction cup worked so well, I didn't think I needed it. The adhesive option seemed a little too permanent for me in case I ever wanted to move it.Pricing was excellent. It replaced and older Escort dash camera, but the newer Escorts were a LOT more expensive. the only thing I might miss at some point is that in order to turn on sound recording, I have to push a button on the Rove. My Escort responded to voice commands, which was nice, but in my opinion, since the Rove was less than half the price, it was a good trade-off. I was lucky enough never to have had to turn on voice recording in the 4-5 years that I had the Escort so I shouldn't miss it.",

                "reviewText": "I've had the camera for a few months now, and it honestly works just fine. This review is mostly intended to talk about some of the concerns that I'm sure many other people have already discussed.Pros:1. The camera was very easy to install right out of the box. The instructions are clear and comprehensive, and I had the camera running in less than 5 minutes.2. The picture quality is pretty good. Like I mentioned, the detail does drop off at a distance, but honestly that's to be expected. It's a dashcam - you're not going to be filming 4k movies with it.3. I like that I don't have to do anything with it. I turn my car on, it turns on. I turn my car off, it turns off. Does exactly what it's supposed to.4. For the camera, it's a good value for the price.Cons:1. It's very weird that in 2023 they're using an obsolete charging cable. It comes with a ~10 ft long mini-USB charging cable. Mind you, that's \"mini,\" not \"micro.\" If I had to hazard a guess, it's to make it harder to replace without going through their company, but I'll get to that in Con #2. This is also very minor, but it bends at a 90 degree angle from the camera, which is totally fine - but the orientation of the charging port causes it to bend \"up,\" which is a little odd.2. To address the elephant in the room: the SD card. I have experienced the dreaded \"Memory card is too slow. Please contact us\" message multiple times in the few months I've owned it. I read the disclaimers. I saw their instructions. I ignored them. Here's the thing: it's very bad business practice to tell people \"Hey, you know the most reliable, well-known, and reputable suppliers of SD cards? Don't use those. Instead, use ours which cost twice as much.\" (Looking at you, Apple) In their description, they will use terms like \"not genuine\" or \"third-party\" to describe other companies that make SD cards (such as Samsung). I'm sorry, Rove, but YOU'RE the third-party here when it comes to technology products. I took great care to ensure that the memory card I purchased met the exact recommended specifications, while admittedly ignoring them requesting I purchase their brand. If they happen to read this: I would have bought your card if it wasn't literally twice as expensive. It kind of feels like a shill: invent a problem (annoying message) and sell people the solution (buy OUR card).All of that being said, if you get this message and have an SD card that actually meets their recommended specs: turn off the camera by hand and turn it back on. Problem solved.",

There is a wealth of information that accompanies the camera and the quality of construction seems to be really, really good.Set up was a piece of cake and the Wi-Fi feature is super helpful. We live full-time in our RV and because of the incidences of people cutting in front of us or merging into us and our limited ability to brake, a dash cam is absolutely required. We really look forward to using this camera on our travels.For Rove, I would recommend a modified attachment for flat vertical windshields (both suction cup and 3M adhesive). It works for us with a slight downward tilt but there is very little room between the camera lens and the windshield.Overall, the price point is totally fine for the features you get with this camera. It really is a solid piece of kit and we are looking forward to documenting our continued travels on the road.",

                "reviewText": "\"After years of buying things on Amazon, it is my first review ever!I spent hundred of hours online to look and compare dashcam specs, price and reviews. This one had all the specs I was looking for, including a reasonable price. But what caught my eye for this one, were the reviews explaining in details how great their experience was with customer Serivce. Another thing that caught my attention was the fact that this company offers firmware updates and an app for your phone.So I bought it and got it the next day! You gotta love Prime!IIn the box, you get 2 usb cables, one short to connect the dashcam to your compter and another one of 12ft long for your car. I quickly released that the 12ft cable was defective. I was not impressed to say the least. Info provided in the box explains that you can contact customer service Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm via text or email but it could take up to 6h. Well, it was a Saturday when I got the dashcam so It was another bummer for me to have to wait until Monday to speak to customer service. I live in Canada so I did not want to text. I decided to email customer Serivce that same Saturday I got my dashcam. A hour after I sent my email, Joe from Rove customer service replied to me and asked me additional info to confirm my credential etc.... Joe was very professional in his communication and on the second email reply, Joe let me know that he shipped a 12ft cable my way and provided me with the UPS tracking #... Unfortunately with the pandemic situation, I got it 2 weeks later, no fault to ROVE neither for the cable, it happens...Here is my review:CUSTOMER SERVICE:5 stars, and I must say that I was impressed with their packaging: easy to read, friendly Manuel, well done!!!HARDWARE:The dashcam does not look cheap at all, very slick and good looking to my point of view, see picture. time will tell but it is a solid 4.5 stars in my bookINSTALATION:Super easy to install, once again the instruction in the box are very well done. In the box they give you a plastic stick to be used to hide/tuck in the wire (see picture). It took me 5 minutes and if I can do it, you can do it!APP:The iPhone (I have the 12pro max) app has a terrible rating on the apple store. Unless the prior versions were glitchy, I can only assume that it was a user error, not the app. The app works as advertised, zero issue for me. I will give the app a solide 4 stars. The app can always be improved and I wish you can have the same options in the app that are available in the dashcam. For example, I would like to be able to change from mile to km within the app without doing it in the dashcam itself. in short, I think the app should mirror the dashcam when it comes to the settings.USER EXPERIENCE:Easy to use despite all the options available for that dashcam. The engineers really had the customer in mind when they created the operation system, they have done a great job with the menu and settings.FIRMWARE:When you have company that provide firmware update, you know that they stand behind their product!VIDEO QUALITYI have zero complains, as advertised, night and day, it looks goodJust for the customer service alone, I will recommend that product. Add to this a dashcam packed with options that are easy to use, installing is a breath, the dashcam video/ picture quality is on point and all of this for a reasonable price.. I have to give overall 5 stars as the company provide app and firmware update and will keep improving this product! \"",

Beim zweiten Versuch hat es dann geklappt.Die Cam l\u00e4\u00dft sich intuitiv bedienen, man stellt die Sprache auf Deutsch um und schon klickt man sich durch das Menue durch und ruckzuck ist alles eingestellt. Die Betriebsanleitung in englisch ist jetzt keine besondere technische Herausforderung und versteht auch der technisch Unversierte. Der Saugnapf h\u00e4lt bombenfest auf seinem Platz. Die Aufnahmen sind gut, daran habe ich nichts auszusetzen. Allerdings darf man sich nicht der falschen Vorstellung hingeben, man k\u00f6nne auch bei Hochaufl\u00f6sung ein Nummernschild wirklich lesen. Bei Autos die einem entgegen kommen und bei Abendd\u00e4mmrung so gut wie nicht, es sei denn beide fahren nur Schrittgeschwindigkeit. Das Nummernschild des Vorausfahrenden kann auch nur gelesen werden wenn man nah genug aufgefahren ist. Aber letztlich geht es im Zweifelsfall um die Darstellung eines evtuellen Unfallgeschehens und daf\u00fcr ist sie von der Aufzeichnungsqualit\u00e4t absolut in Ordnung. Bei sonnigem Wetter ist die Lesbarkeit von Nummernschildern und Ortstafeln besser. Das GPS Signal kommt, je nach Verf\u00fcgbarkeit, nach 200 m Fahrzeit und zeichnet korrekt auf. Das Anbringen der Cam an der Windschutzscheibe ist simpel und dank der geringen Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Cam st\u00f6rt sie auch die Sicht nicht. Ich hab sie bei mir direkt neben dem Innenspiegel leicht versetzt angebracht. Das Stromkabel habe ich nicht extra verlegt. Mich st\u00f6rt ein kurzes Kabel das offen liegt nicht. Es ist ja ohnehin nur eins, da das GPs Modul im Ger\u00e4t selbst enthalten ist. Bei einer anderen Cam die ich habe, ben\u00f6tigt man eine gesonderte GPS Antenne und schon hat man 2 Kabel. Insofern ist die L\u00f6sung mit GPS im Ger\u00e4t deutlich besser und es entsteht kein Kabelsalat. Die Aufnahmen selbst k\u00f6nnen \u00fcber den PC problemlos angeschaut werden. Zeit und gefahrene Geschwindigkeit werden korrekt wiedergegeben, \u00fcber google maps kann auch der Fahrtverlauf dargestellt werden. Nachtfahrten hab ich mit der Cam noch nicht durchgef\u00fchrt, insofern kann ich zur Bildqualit\u00e4t hierzu keine Aussage treffen. Bislang erf\u00fcllt die Cam die Erwartungen und insofern eine klare Kaufempfehlung.",
