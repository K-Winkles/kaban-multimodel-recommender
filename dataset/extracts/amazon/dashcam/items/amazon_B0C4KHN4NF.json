Without connecting the car charger, even if the battery of dash cam is fully charged, it will turn off automatically within 1 minute. It's not a battery problem, it's an automatic shutdown set by the system to save power for the purpose of recording video in emergency. All dash cams on the market are like this, please don't worry about the battery. \u2714\ufe0fPlease always keep the dash cam plugged into the car's cigarette lighter to achieve the continuous operation of the dash cam. 4. Before inserting or removing the micro SD card, please be sure to turn off the power of the dashcam to avoid data loss. 5.
