The only thing I would have liked to see would have been some clips or something to help hang the wire. I don't have a space to tuck the wire into around my windshield. I am also waiting to see how well it stays on the windshield with the heat from southern US beating down on it. The heat has destroyed or demounted many other dash cams.",

I was able to use the existing power cable (micro usb - not the C type like most) Voice commands are great ( you cannot use them when app is open )- multi function power button for features (off, format card, etc ) Air venting is great for these cameras - they get very warm. Female voice prompts easy to understand. Clear pics. Good, basic dash cam without all the obstruction of bigger units cluttering up the windshield (why the need for monitors?) Hope this holds up - I will update after longer use.",

Don't know how or why but it did. I put it in my wife's car not expecting much but, amazingly, everything works as it should and the video quality is amazing.
