A: Select a commonly used mobile phone and scan the QR code in the user manual, or search for \u201cViidure\u201d installation on Google Play or APP Store. Q: Can't connect WiFi or connect failed? A: Please remember to authorize the App with the album, location, WLAN & cellulardata and turn off the VPN, security software and anti-virus APP of your mobile phone, otherwise you will not be able to connect to wifi. Q: Why doesn't WiFi connected automatically? A: Let me explain to you why we set the wifi to need to be connected manually instead of automatically connect the wifi as soon as it is turned on. Since many mobile phones on the market are single-channel mobile phones, the SIM card cannot be used after connecting to WiFi. We are worried that the automatic opening and connection of WiFi will cause some mobile phones to be unable to use 4/5G and miss important information. Q: Is it possible to watch live video when the app is not connected to wifi? A: When the app is not connected to the recorder wifi, it isn't possible to watch live video, you can only view the downloaded and saved video files in the app. Q: Can't recording/taping? A: Please use genuine Class 10 or above high speed card, suggest using 16GB-128GB SD card, and check that the memory card is installed correctly, or the memory card is not formatted or not, please format SD card in APP. Note: When the memory card is inserted into the camera for the first time, it requires to be formatted on APP. Q: How to activate this dash cam's parking monitoring function? A: DC-Q3 dash cam support 24 hours recording only when it is connected to a mini USB hardwire kit (NOTE: HARDWIRE KIT NOT INCLUDED), please connect the hardwire kit to you fuse box. (If you don't know how to install the hardwire kit, please ask a professional for help)",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a gift for my 74 year old mom. She had an incident where someone kept backing into her causing damage to her vehicle on the highway stuck in traffic. Unfortunately she didn't have video proof and was forced to suck up the deductible. This should definitely help of that happens again. The camera is small and that's exactly what I wanted for her. Easy to mount and install and hardly noticeable on the windsheild. The app is easy to use and the installation was very easy. The picture quality is good and very clear. I would recommend this for a good front view dashcam.",

                "reviewText": "I like how small and discreet this little camera is. It's not distracting because there is not a view screen to look at while driving and the little lights to alert that it's on are not big or overly bright.I like how I don't have to worry about hitting any start/stop buttons when I get in my car, I just start my car and the camera starts right up. The video and sound quality are also really good. Night video isn't top notch, but it is still decent with brights on.The app was easy to load and connection was easy once I figured out the wifi password, but all the instruction are right there with the little paperwork that comes with it.My only issue was getting the camera to stay on my windshield. It kept falling for a few days, but after a nice hard press for about a minute, it's now been up there without falling for over a week.",
