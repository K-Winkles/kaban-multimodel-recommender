                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Wifi doesn't work at ALL, GPS does not set clock, it uses Mini-USB connectors",
                "reviewText": "I just bought an A129 Pro Duo to replace a Mini0906 (that thing was NOT one of the best cams like dashcamtalk claimed, but was a complete turd).=== Let's get the negatives out of the way:On the A129 Pro Duo, the wifi feature is not broadcasting. I have tried 2.4GHz, 5GHz auto, and 5GHz forced to channel 40, and 5GHz forced to channel 36, and forced to 161; the SSID is never broadcast. As the MAC is not listed on the device (SHAME ON YOU, VIOFO!), I checked for new APs without an SSID and toggled wifi on and off, and no new MACs showed up, so it appears wifi is totally nonfunctional.It is otherwise a fantastic unit and I will be updating the review after I test night recording. I'm docking four stars as one of the reasons I bought this unit was wifi connectivity, and yet, I will be forced to pull the microsd card and use dashcamviewer to review footage. WTF, VIOFO? Fix the firmware please. Docking four stars for this.Also, Mini USB connectors? Why not USB-C? WTF? If you had used USB-C I could have prewired my car before the camera arrived.No volume setting for that infernal beep? Only On/OFF? I want the beep, I just don't want it to be eardrum-piercingly and nerve-gratingly loud. Do us a solid and give us a volume control for the beep, please, even if it's just \"LOUD - MEDIUM - SOFT - OFF\"And, why not a full kit which includes the hardwire kit, bluetooth remote and polarizing filters for both the front and rear cameras?OK, so with all the negatives that garnered a 1-star rating (only because I could not rate it zero) out of the way:=== Positives1. IT HAS A SCREEN! I skipped the Thinkware U1000 because even though it's objectively a better product, I wanted an integrated screen in case WiFi fails2. DAY, FRONT Video quality is GREAT - at least in daylight (I will update this review over time).3. It is easy to install4. I like that there is a prewiring kit and a customizable parking mode (again, I will update this over time)5. I like the visual recording, wifi, and mic LED indicators so I can check without having to wake up the screen6. THANK YOU for implementing a screen timeout/\"screen saver\" feature. With most dashcams with screens, I need to manually turn the screen on and off. It's nice being able to tap a button and check status and let it time out and turn off on its own7. I like that it's low profile and will not interfere with the visor as much as other models do.8. I like the faint LED in the GPS mount; with the camera pulled off the mount, I can see that the GPS mount is receiving power9. I like that WiFi can theoretically be toggled on/off with the overlay button (I say theoretically because WiFI actually doesn't work at all)10.=== Suggested improvements: * Switch over to all USB-C connectors * Support 1TB+ MicroSD cards * Allow your app to read MicroSD cards (since wifi doesn't work at all) * Implement a more active cooling scheme (phase changing heat pipe + maybe a fan) * Cloud recording/storage/vehicle tracker/locator connectivity: Cloud connectivity? (I'd subscribe for $5 to $10/month if you would archive 30+ days of coverage and allow easy merging/exporting from the cloud - this would be a nice recurring revenue stream for you) * Car locator feature (easy with GPS + cloud connectivity), with live view * Android Auto/Carplay integration to use rear channel as rearview mirror in infotainment for those of us who drive vehicles with useless back windows (sportscars, trucks, etc.) * a full kit which includes the hardwire kit, bluetooth remote and polarizing filters for both the front and rear cameras? * 3 channel support * higher quality sensors both front and rear <---<< * flip screen or android auto plugin to display either channel, use rear channel as supplemental rearview mirror view=== Update day 2:I haven't recorded any footage for a review/sample video yet; I have been playing with parking mode settings and H.265 vs. H.264 and when I used H.265 and let parking mode run overnight and retrieved it in the morning, the camera was so hot it felt scalding - it hadn't been in the sun yet and the car interior was still cool. I did not have my IR thermometer handy so I did not actually measure it but I'd guess it was 70c at the very least. I was nervous letting it run in my Stinger so I disabled H.265 and reduced the video bitrate from maximum to high.Resolution maximum, WDR enabled, bitrate Maximum, EV = 0, rural/light suburban roads:Reviewing day footage on 4K screen w/Dashcam Viewer, I can easily read license plates of cars I am following. It is very difficult to find any frames where license tags of oncoming cars are readable. However, nighttime capture of registration tags are not readable. There is much blooming which of course obscures much of the scene.Rear channel, 1080p:Reviewing night footage, WDR enabled, bitrate Maximum, EV = 0, rural/light suburban roads:License tags of oncoming and following cars unreadable. Rear camera underexposed, difficult to make out detail on rural roads, cannot read following vehicles' plates (expected). Basically, meets expectations, provides some protection.== ExchangeVIOFO want me to send the camera in for exchange. If it comes to that I'll do an Amazon exchange, returning the replacement box with the old camera since I had already installed the cables and tossed the package in recycling. I was hoping they'd come back with \"Oh the firmware is buggy and here's an update\" :-( On the bright side they respond fairly quickly.=== Corrections to previous complaint:Time DOES appear to update automagically via GPS.=== Update: ===I received a replacement - I submitted a support ticket and they made the exhange super easy, with advance shipment of the dashcam. I am pleased to report that the wifi features work on the replacement camera. I am happy with the unit so far. The high temperature does concern me a bit though.=== Update 15 months later: ===Unit is under the extended warranty (I had to register it because the original came DOA). I was previously very happy with it but now the camera is freezing when powered through the integrated USB port. When powered through the GPS module/mount it functions fine - NO freezing, but the unit runs hotter and drains the battery quickly when powered through the GPS mount (this is a common problem discussed on messageboards, mentioned in a couple reviews here, etc.). Well, they tried to blame the USB cord (uh, no, I am using the hardwire kit), or the SD card (I already indicated I write/read tested the SD card using both Windows and Linux, so the SD card is not the problem), or parking mode (No, I will NOT turn off parking mode, as that is THE feature which prompted me to select this product).As such, all the way down to 1 star because their customer service has declined and they're obnoxiously patronizing with their canned responses.=== Another update, a few days later ===I just learned they are off for Chinese new year. With that in mind, I can only conclude they took the time to try to lend some support during the holiday so I am restoring my original rating of the product, and I humbly apologize to Viofo for my jumping to conclusions.",

                "reviewText": "So I did my little research, and apparently, this is the best dashcam you can get. It has better image quality than any other 4k dashcam. It has parking monitoring, GPS data, movement sensors, and all sorts of good stuff.I hardwired the dashcam myself. I was pretty confident that I got every step right. And the reality was that I did get everything right for the installation part but I messed up the last and the easiest step: putting in the correct memory card!!! This is important! You don't want to just put in a 512G memory card into this thing as I did. It says in the description that this dashcam doesn't support any memory card larger than 256G.Because of the 512g memory card, it hasn't been working properly for an entire year after I got it. It couldn't automatically start recording with the car. It couldn't perform any parking monitoring even if I turned on the settings in the app. It couldn't save recordings. I didn't bother so I just left it as it was. In last month, the dashcam started repeatedly showing an error message on the screen. I finally decided to change the memory card to a 256g card, and everything started working perfectly! Now it starts recording automatically and it performs the parking monitoring perfectly. So there wasn't anything wrong with the dashcam. It was just the memory card.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A dashcam that tops all.",
                "reviewText": "Let me preface by saying, I would of uploaded a video of the footage, but there are tons of other great videos out there demonstrating the product, and I do not want to give out my coordinates. So you are just going to have to take my word for it. If you are a tech-savvy person, read on. If not, whatever, Im not getting paid.I personally have the highest speed recommended MicroSD card inserted into the dashcam, which is a Samsung microSDXC Evo Plus 256GB, UHS-1. The speeds I get writing to my SSD are around 33-40MB/s. Which.. is decent. I would recommend this card because its the best you could get thats recommended in the manual. Although samsung doesn't have a warranty on this MicroSD, due to dashcams having an intense write to the card.With that aside, I recommend writing the footage from the MicroSD to an SSD, then archiving it to a spinny disk of your choosing. I use my laptop for portability.Now.. This is a true 4k dashcam. I have seen dashcams that claim that they are 4k, but do not have a true resolution of 3840 by 2160p. The front dashcam is 4k, and has a very high bit-rate, which makes this dashcam topple every other dashcam in the market. The rear dashcam is unfortunately 1920 by 1080p, and does not have the best bitrate in my opinion. This is probably to save space on the card, but for $250, you have to cut corners somewhere.I will section off this review by going over the front and rear dashcams, but let me start off by saying I have 5% tint all around, and 70% tint in the front windshield. Also, Ive driven for about 90 minutes of footage now and I have used up 40GB worth of footage. I run my dashcam on the highest resolution on both cameras, and the highest bitrate on both cameras, sectioned off into 1 minute clips, both front in rear. The dashcam sections these off into numbers, for example: \"20200818_101037R\". These break down into the following: 2020 - year, 08 - month. 18 - day, _ - separates the day with the exact time, 10- military hours, 10 - 10 mins, 37 - 37 seconds into the minute, R/F - Rear camera and Front camera respectively. The dashcam records these files in MP4 format, so every computer has the capability of reviewing the footage, IIRC. Its easy to see which Front footage goes with the Rear, because they share the exact same time stamp, so there is zero confusion there. Audio records from the front facing dashcam, and shares the same audio when looking at the rear footage.Front: Ive previewed the footage on my 4k laptop and cross checked on my Samsung 4k monitor, and the resolution is very crisp, and quite frankly amazing. Every frame you pause the video on, you are able to make out EVERY SINGLE LEAVE on every single tree. The high bitrate is outstanding. The resolution is outstanding. With cars parked on either side of the vehicle, you are able to make out the license plates, the camera lens makes no compromises from extreme angles. The only con I have about the front dashcam is when the sun is shining directly onto the license plate from your point of view. As you know.. license plates are extremely reflective, and when the angle is right, you are unable to make out the license plate due to the shine from the sun. Night driving is spectacular, with 70% tint, I am still able to make out license plates from 3-4 car lengths away. Note that both dash cams auto adjust their exposure levels.Rear: **PSA: Please make sure you mount the rear dashcam ABOVE your heating element, so the sticky pad does not ruin your rear defroster, if and when you decide to remove it, and make sure the camera is looking THROUGH the heating element. This is to prevent foggy footage if your windows fog up during the night time.**Looking at the footage, day driving looks good, not great. You can barely read out the license plates when looking through the rear dashcam, but if a vehicle passes you, the front dashcam will pick up their license plate. In my opinion, the rear dashcam is a \"I'd rather have it and not need it, then need it and not have it\" type of situation. Its useful by determining the make/model/color and prior damage of the vehicle, but picking out plate numbers from the rear is a challenge. You might be able to make out one or two characters of the vehicle's license plate, but good luck. Like I have said before, I have 5% tint on my back windshield, however, at times before 7PM, the rear dashcam is very effective. Looking through the camera at night, the only thing you are going to be seeing is your 3rd brake light shine, which is a good indicator that you are pressing on the brakes in the event of an accident. The other party will not be able to say that you weren't. Thats IF there is no car behind you. If there is a car behind you, thankfully the dashcam adjusts the exposure, and you are able to see the car's front hood and two lights. You're really banking on being under a street lamp to see anything more than that, if your car has 5% tint. I wouldn't worry about it too much, because the chances of a car being behind you at night with no lights on is very slim..Interface: There is dedicated buttons on the front of the camera, so no need to touch the rear camera after installation. Dedicated Mute button, dedicated wifi, dedicated \"lock footage\" button are all very welcome. Yes I said WiFi, yes, the app is trash and crashes from time to time. In the box, it includes a MicroSD to USB, which is welcome if you do not have a MicroSD card reader, so there is no reason to look at the app to check the WiFi footage (supports 2.4ghz and 5ghz connections). Some people have the hard wired kit and say they can look through the dashcam when the car is off, but I can't confirm/deny that because I do not have the hardwire kit. I will take a battery pack with me and use it whenever I park in the city if I want to be extra cautious.Audio: Worth a mention, the microphone used in this product is pretty good. It picks up the higher notes of music, so if you have a bass heavy sound system, you are still able to hear, and wont get drowned out by the bass.TLDR - I recommend this product. I gave this dashcam 4 stars because of the low bitrate for the rear camera, making it near impossible to read out license plates. Other than that, its a solid product.",

The image quality is great and comes close to its competitors that are currently available on market at this time. The only downside is at night time it does struggle to read license plates especially if your headlights are shining directly on the car in front of you...I like the app Viofo has and paired with it you can definitely unlock more of the cameras potential. Ive recommended this to all my friends and family as its rather affordable and you get peace of mind knowing that in the event you need a dash camera you have one!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using my GoPro Hero 8 as my dashcam for many years, however, it gets too hot and turn itself off many times during the summer. Then I decided to get a solid and reasonable price dashcam instead. I have reviewed several dashcams online, and finally decided to get VIOFO 4k Duo from Amazon. First, it's under my budget of $300 (honestly I don't think $800 BV is worth it) Secondly, it's 4K and the quality is one of the best after few reviews over the years. Third the App is easy to use and there are lots of tutorial video online about this one, it's easy to learn and easy to operate. However, I quoted a price for dashcam installation in my Ford Ranger, the bodyshop I used to visit, asks for $300 for the whole process. After viewing several DIY videos on YouTube, I decided to do it myself. The good thing about Ford Ranger, it has a USB slot right behind the rear mirror, I could connect the dashcam using a short power cable, which is the same type of GoPro Hero 4. It only took about one-hour and I saved $300 easily! I tested it several times, the video quality is really good, especially under 4K, I could save the video directly from my iPhone and edit the video on the phone. I would say it's a really good deal if you are thinking about the protect your valuable car and win the claim after the accident. I would recommend it to others.Please note, don't hide your cable near the airbags as I shown in one of the pictures. I accident did it first and one mechanic told me that it would create more damage to the driver when the airbag pops out. So always hide the cable through the bottom section of the door frame.",

                "reviewText": "On some review website, someone \"claimed\" to have tested this product's power consumption (I'll get to why this is important) and including the GPS module and back camera, it was supposed to consume around 3.1W of power at most.Quality of the front and back camera seems good, as this is my first dashcam for my car, I have nothing to compare it with, I was recommended here by Youtuber reviewers (LTT).The problem, I bought a 50Wh battery assuming it would consume 3W, set it up at 10pm at night for parking recording. Next morning at 11am, DEAD battery.My reaction was like \"WTF\", power consumption should be about 90% loss, so I should have a 45Wh, which should be around 15 hours MINIMUM with a 50Wh battery. Then I had to get out my tools to measure the ACTUAL consumption. It wasn't 3W or 3.1W, nowhere close. I ensured the dashcam was setup to parking mode, and waited for atleast 10 minutes sitting inside the car, in a garage with no one else. The camera would waver around 3.9W to 4.1W, most of the time at 4.1W. Doing nothing. Since park recording ONLY records when there is movement it was still burning 4.1W. I even disabled the GPS module, didn't matter much, still consumed a little over 4W.This required some massive innovation, or lack of. I refused to hook to car battery, so I had to get a 100W PD capable lithium ion battery at the size of 99Wh. I couldn't use LiFePo as they came in 70Wh, and costs about $400 EACH. (Life expectancy of LiFePo should be about 4+ years, Li-Ion would be 2+ years, 1500 cycles vs 500 cycles)Even with the 99Wh battery, I killed my battery in under 20 hours. I ordered another, hooked up a Y usb connecter. With two 100Wh hooked up to 200Wh, I had about 40 hours of power before it dried up.Why use 100W PD? Because 100W PD charges 80% of the battery in about one hour from a 100W charger for a 99Wh capacity. (batteries trickle charge after reaching 80% mark). Anything slower than an hour is no good because my driving sessions are regularly around 40 minute mark.All this work, just because this camera consumes a lot more power than expected. (25% extra power consumption is nothing to sneeze at.)",
