The mount looked almost identical although I believe the slot for the camera is smaller than what I needed. However, the suction mount and most importantly the tightening nut were identical and the nut worked perfectly with my original mount which also had a GPS antenna attached. If that mount ever breaks, I should be able use these mounts and either transfer the antenna module or skip it as the GPS never worked well anyway. I'm glad I took a risk on buying these and now I even have an extra set as a backup.",

Decid\u00ed darle una oportunidad y... en qu\u00e9 buen momento lo hice.El soporte ha resistido las alt\u00edsimas temperaturas del sur durante nuestras vacaciones como un campe\u00f3n. El montaje no puede ser m\u00e1s sencillo: poner en el cristal y bajar la pesta\u00f1a. Autom\u00e1ticamente queda totalmente sujeto.Ah, y un detalle: a parte de los dos soportes que trae el paquete, incluye un lector de tarjetas microSD. De momento muy satisfecho con la compra.",
