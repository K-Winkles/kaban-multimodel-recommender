                "reviewText": "Very Surprising Camera. First off, the suction of the window holder is top notch. It has survived sitting on a hot windshield for hours and not a once did it fall, or even seem loose. Major plus for me since I have had GPS devices that fall over and over again installed in that manner.As for the camera itself, video quality is pretty good. It's pretty clear and shows a great picture at night as well. Videos are loop recorded, and you can save a video manually if you want, or stop recording with the push of a button. It also records audio.The box comes with a full set of instructions that actually explain what each button does, as well as accessories such as MicroSD card reader USB Adapter to view the videos you record. A 32 GB Micro SD card is also included, but you can use a larger card if you choose. The Camera supports constant recording if installed to an always-on Power supply, so you can record video even when not around your vehicle. Would work great for those hit and run situations.In conclusion, this is a very well built, High Quality Dash Cam, and can easily be used in personal, or fleet service. For the asking price, the quality can't be beat.",

                "reviewText": "If you are looking for your first dashcam and have knowledge with navigating through multiple menus on a 3\" screen then this may be a good choice to see if a dashcam will be beneficial. Here are the Cons. Con #1- A 32gb micro SD is to small. With limiting you at a 32 max you won't be able to record a complete day of AVI files. You'll want to bring a couple more cards with you to swap out during your trip. Con #2- it saves files in AVI and my Chromebook I keep with me wouldn't open the files. You will need to install an app to covert them to a jpg or MV4 before being viewed. Con #3- It's not easy to navigate through the menu options and if you have thick fingers you'll have the tendency to push the wrong button. Con #4- Once you have it mounted onto your glass it's difficult to change menu settings and remove the SD card. Pro #1- For entry level it works. $39 with card is a pretty good deal. When you upgrade to another camera keep it as a backup or put in your kids car. (They'll love you for it \ud83d\ude02) Pro #2- it has a metal case and unlike my previous plastic one it hasn't split in half yet and spewed it guts all over the dash when the suction cup decides it time to let go. Pro#3- it works and it cheap",

It looks almost as if it's daylight, however, when you pass cars the entire screen turns white, so the light filtering is not very good. It is also really good during the day and has high-quality video, but if the sun is in the frame, it's just a white screen. Other than the light filtering, it's a very good dashcam. Make sure it's plugged all the way into the outlet or it will randomly turn off. Buy a larger SD card because the one that comes with the camera will fill pretty quickly.",
