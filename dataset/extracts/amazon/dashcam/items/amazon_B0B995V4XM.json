                "reviewText": "First and foremost, the video quality is outstanding. The crystal-clear recordings capture every detail on the road, from license plates to street signs. Even in low-light conditions, the camera's advanced sensor technology ensures that the footage remains sharp and clear.Installation was a breeze. The adhesive mount securely holds the camera in place on my windshield, and the compact design doesn't obstruct my view at all. It's great to have a device that's so easy to set up without any complicated wiring or intricate installation procedures.One feature that really stands out is the built-in GPS. Not only does it log my speed and location, but it also provides an extra layer of evidence in case of an incident. The G-sensor is a game-changer too \u2013 it automatically locks and protects footage when it detects sudden movements or impacts, ensuring that crucial evidence is never lost.I was pleasantly surprised by the camera's user-friendly interface. Navigating through settings and reviewing footage is intuitive and hassle-free. Plus, the companion smartphone app makes it incredibly convenient to view and share recordings on the go.The loop recording feature is a lifesaver. I never have to worry about running out of storage space, as the camera automatically overwrites the oldest files when the memory card is full. This means I can keep recording without constantly managing the storage.Lastly, I can't ignore the peace of mind this dash camera gives me. Knowing that I have a reliable witness for any unforeseen incidents on the road is priceless. I feel safer and more confident while driving, especially during long trips or in busy city traffic.Overall, I can't recommend this dash camera enough. It's packed with features that not only enhance my driving experience but also provide essential security and accountability. If you're looking for a top-notch dash camera that combines superior video quality, user-friendly features, and easy installation, this is the one to go for!",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE:4-12-23I am writing to update my review.I was contacted by a representative for the company and they resolved my problem to my satisfaction. No jumping through hoops. Their customer service is top notch! The product so far has been great since getting the original issue resolved.I really love the way it works and starts recording when the car starts!The multiple angles that you can record at one time is awesome with the two cameras on the unit and then a third camera for the rear.I love how you can set the cameras to record in clips. I use 5 minute clips. I find this makes it pretty simple to review if needed.To this moment, I have not had any further issue's like I was having before working with the representative from the company that reached out.I will come back and update this review if issues come back.ThanksOriginal post below:I have tried to reach out to the warranty department and also find an email or phone number to talk to someone about the issues I am having before I left this review. Maybe someone will contact me here.I do not want to return camera because I drive daily and at least have it as a deterant for would be thieves.The issue I am having is I can get in the car and start it up and the camera comes on and starts recording. Then as I am driving, I notice the camera is still on, but stops recording!!!!The only way I can get it start recording again is to disconnect it from power and then turn it back on (which is dangerous while driving)But then that only seems to last for a short time before it stops again.It just started doing this all of the sudden.I work in IT so I have done troubleshooting. Including redoing the power connector, replaced the micro SD card, completely reset the camera and settings. Nothing has worked.I would also like to mention I am using premium Micro SD cards.I have formated them according to specs for the camera and am using the recommended size. As I said, this is a recent issue that just started happening and now won't resolve.I actually love the camera and the angles it records at, when it works.Hopefully the company will contact me and send a replacement or offer troubleshooting steps I've missed.Very disappointing.I am hoping the company will reach out to me with a resolution ASAP!Please help, I really don't want to return. I WILL if I have to. But might have to order a different brand that will atleast help their customers.Thank",

                "reviewText": "This camera is literally amazing for the price.You literally get three cameras in one. This is an amazing tool for rideshare operators such as Lyft and Uber drivers.In the main camera assembly, there is both front and rear facing cameras. There is also an additional third auxiliary camera which can be installed in the rear of the vehicle to capture rear facing traffic, or you can easily install it in the backseat of your vehicle to capture customer interactions.And this way, it\u2019s perfect for rideshare drivers because you could have one camera facing the road one camera facing yourself, and another camera facing your customers, providing you with a ultimate degree of video, surveillance and accountability to customers and your employer.This camera is super high-quality and has amazingly clear video. I also really liked that. It was very easy to install and comes with this neat little tucking tool, allowing you to easily conceal the wires behind the trim without having to pop off any of the trim and risk, breaking the little clips that secure it inside the cabin of the vehicle.I wish that it was sold with a memory card. I did have to supply my own, but ultimately for the price I still think it represents exceptional value.I\u2019m very happy with this camera and will absolutely be recommending it to all of my friends that also operate as rideshare drivers and I am very happy to give this a five star review.",
