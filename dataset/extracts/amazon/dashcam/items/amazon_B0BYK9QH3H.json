With sharp and vivid images, you can read number plates, road signs, and any other important detail with ease. (Class 10, U3 Speed Micro-SD Card for 4K Video is required)",
            "Super Night Vision: Super clear vision on fast-moving objects day and night thanks to StarVis f/1.6 large aperture, and WDR (Wide Dynamic Range) that adapt to different light levels and reduce image noise in low light conditions. This dash cam gives you all day peace of mind.",
            "GPS Tracking and More: This dash cam comes with GPS built in. So things like tracking your driving route, speed, location, etc. can be done at once easily. In addition, you can remotely (33ft) track the car on Google map via the app (WiFi required) or your our Windows and Mac GPSPlayer (USB-C cable required) and have extra peace of mind in case of an accident.",
            "Never Miss the Key Moment: With high, medium, and low sensitivity levels, the 3-axis G Sensor will record 30 seconds before and after an incident and save a 60-second emergency video even the engine is off for you. And with Loop Recording, the SD card will never run out of space, as old non-emergency files will be auto overwritten for continuous recording. Plus the Parking Mode (hardware kit required, not included) records your car's surroundings 24/7 when you are away.",
            "24/7 Peace of Mind: Built-in G-sensor detects impacts and locks the recording in case of an accident, so you can be sure that you'll have evidence of what happened. Along with the loop recording to ensure that you never miss a moment, ideal for long-distance driving. Also, a hardwire kit can be purchased separately to enable Parking mode.",
