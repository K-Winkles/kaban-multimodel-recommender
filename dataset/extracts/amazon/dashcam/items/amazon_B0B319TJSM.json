Connect the yellow wire from the hardwire kit to the constant power fuse slot. You can use a fuse tap or a fuse adapter to make the connection. 5. Find a suitable grounding point near the fuse box. It should be a metal surface that is securely connected to the vehicle's chassis. 6. Connect the black wire from the hardwire kit to the grounding point using a ring terminal or a suitable grounding connector. 7. Once all the connections are secure, tuck away any excess wires and ensure they are safely routed to avoid interference with the vehicle's controls. 8.
