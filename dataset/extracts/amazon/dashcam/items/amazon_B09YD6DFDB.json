                "reviewText": "Camera quality is good in daylight and OK at night. Installed with an Atoto A6 PF in a 350Z. Only two real complaints. One is when you pick MPH instead of KPH, it only changes video tag on bottom to mph. All remaining numbers (speed and distance) remain in Kilometers. Why not update all?And two, the ADAS warning of \"vehicle to close\" either never warns at all in \"low\" setting, or warns constantly with any vehicle in sight in \"medium or high\" settings. Seems to me this could work much better since the distances shown on screen seem pretty accurate. Also direction indication written out does not fit well in display. Why not just NE, SW, etc.? This would be 5 stars with proper software. Lane change warning is useless, sometime works, sometimes no warning at all.",
