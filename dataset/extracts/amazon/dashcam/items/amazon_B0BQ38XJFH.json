                "reviewText": "I was originally looking for just the front-facing dash cam but the passenger recording feature is a nice add-on. I've used it for a couple of weeks now and my experience has been great. I've it mounted on my dash instead of the windshield and it records great videos. Not only does it record incidents but also great videos in general during your road trips. The night vision is crisp and clear. Loop recording is standard . My favorite feature is the app and wifi and it enables saving videos, GPS features, and 24-hour monitoring especially any incidents while the vehicle is parked, etc. recommend this product.",

If anything happen at the back that this front only recording is useless. Two camera system is good but you need to pay a pro to run the cable to the back trunk and drill a hole for camera lens. Until this model that has build-in two camera that I really like, I can just remove the center headset piece the the back view is easily recorded into high res 4K video I\u2019m very impressed the quality!!!",

The quality of the recoding is better than my previous dashcam that I got a year and half ago.Highly recommend it, I think I need to get another one for my dad too.",
