If you need to find an ignition switched fuse, put the key in the vehicle, find the fuse which is not lit up while the car is off, and test it by turning the car on to see if it lights up. If your kit requires constant power, turn off the car and remove the key to see which fuse slots stays lit on. Connect the Red Wire Once you've determined which fuse slots you need to use for your hardwiring kit you can crimp the red wire of your hardwire kit onto the Add-A-Fuse. Gently remove the fuse you identified. Install the fuse you just removed into the installation kit add-a-fuse circuit. Plug the add-a-circuit into the fuse box in the correct orientation. Ground the Hardwiring Kit Slip the black wire (which is in the shape of a C) under a metal bolt or screw in your vehicle (this is the ground wire). Check that it is not attached onto plastic parts. You will typically need a socket wrench to loosen the nut or bolt that you choose to ground with. To attach the grounding terminal, loosen the nut or bolt enough to slip it in and tighten it back up afterwards.",

The dashcam goes off and on with the ignition just as the wife wants it. Just take your time installing and it will work great for you.",

The connections made it very easy. I love that it came with different size fuse taps depending on where you want to use it. I also like that it had a mini and micro usb option. Just wish it had a usb type c but I bought an adapter that took care of that. Plenty of length in the wiring. All in all good product.
