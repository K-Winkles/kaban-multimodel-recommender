If your kit requires constant power, turn off the car and remove the key to see which fuse slots stays lit on. Connect the Red Wire Once you've determined which fuse slots you need to use for your hardwiring kit you can crimp the red wire of your hardwire kit onto the Add-A-Fuse. Gently remove the fuse you identified. Install the fuse you just removed into the installation kit add-a-fuse circuit. Plug the add-a-circuit into the fuse box in the correct orientation. Ground the Hardwiring Kit Slip the black wire (which is in the shape of a C) under a metal bolt or screw in your vehicle (this is the ground wire). Check that it is not attached onto plastic parts. You will typically need a socket wrench to loosen the nut or bolt that you choose to ground with. To attach the grounding terminal, loosen the nut or bolt enough to slip it in and tighten it back up afterwards.

                "reviewText": "Product seems high quality. Installation was straightforward. I purchased this \"single lead\" kit for my Garmin Dash Cam Mini 2 because I did not need or want the Parking Mode feature. I used an \"Accessory\" fuse. The dash cam worked fine, but I noticed it turn off after a few minutes, then back on a few minutes later, and then back on... Garmin (understandably) does not support 3rd party installation kits. They were not helpful except to point out in their literature that 3rd party cables are not compatible with Garmin products. I went ahead and bought the Garmin Parking Mode cable ($35) and installed it using Accessory fuses for both the battery (normally always powered) and Accessory leads as I do not want the device powered when the vehicle is off. So far, so good. No issues with the device cycling on and off. When you start the car, the camera comes on. When you shut the vehicle off, the camera is off. Not sure why the other cable kit didn't work with the Garmin, but I had issues. 5 stars, though, for what appears to be a good quality kit.",

I don't remember seeing instructions for that anywhere, so the install isnt completely idiot-proof.I liked that the kit includes a plastic tool for popping panels and fixtures off so i didnt have to buy a separate one, also the kit has multiple fuses and adapters so you likely have what you need.The only thing i can complain about is that the included fuse was not the right amps for what i needed, i had to get a kit with one that was the right size and amps for my particular install, this may be specific to my car though.",

                "reviewText": "This hardwire kit was easy to install using the provided fuse adapter. Put it in a key-on location. I would have no problem putting it in an always-on fuse location because the low voltage cut-off absolutely works. After installing, my camera would intermittently shut off while I was driving, then come back on a few minutes later. This never happened when I used the cigarette lighter adapter. I thought the hardwire kit was to blame. Turns out I had a bad voltage regulator and my battery was dropping to 11v before the alternator started charging and it cut off at 12.4v. The kit was going into low voltage battery saver mode as designed, on and off as the voltage changed. I never had a dash light come on for the charging system, but this kit working as designed gave me a reason to troubleshoot.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to hook up a mini dashcam in my SUV and it worked fine after a bit of setup.I needed the right angled micro connector to keep a small footprint on the windshield and this seemed like the perfect fit.After routing the nicely flexible black usb type cable under the headliner/panels etc to behind the fuse box in the passenger footwell I still had a good 18\" left over and zip tied the excess with the converter box to the frame behind a panel. Screwing on the ground wire was no problem and one of the fuse extenders fit perfectly but then I hit a problem. After everything was connected I had no power to the camera and after quite a bit of messing around I found that the red wire that connects the converter to the fuse extender had broken off at the connector. This wire is super thin and was being held onto the clip by the plastic sheath so it was hard to see the break. I had to solder this together in the footwell, upside down, which was a challenge but when reconnected everything was fine.One thing to be conscious of when doing this work is if it took a long time to route everything and the vehicle lights were on, the battery may have gone below the safety threshold causing the converter will turn off. This will look like no power until you actually start the engine [this happened to me after the solder job causing me to doubt my soldering skills].However despite the problem I had, which may have been me not being careful, I recommend this product though they could use thicker wire.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, a good accessory to have. Keeps the USB plugs at the console free for my regular stuff. Most of the time needed to install the kit was finding a fuse that did not power off when the ignition was turned off. I wanted camera monitoring while the car was parked. Note that the fuse adapter is not marked to indicate which slot should have the larger amperage fuse. If you remove a 20 amp fuse, it needs to be inserted into the correct adapter slots or the 5 amp fuse provided with the power module will actually be in the 20 amp circuit......and a new 5 amp fuse will be needed when that seat heater is turned on! This takes a few minutes to figure out with an ohm meter or continuity light. Make sure your selected fuse is not a critical circuit like headlights, control computer, etc.Placing the wire under the interior trim and headliner edge to reach the mirror location was pretty easy in my car. Highly recommend placing the camera end of the wire at the camera location and checking the wire length along your planned wiring route to make sure the power module can be mounted out of sight. The installation prying tool that was provided with the kit was helpful, but having two helped with tight fitting trim pieces. I have a small kit of plastic trim prying tools from the local car parts place. An extra one came in handy.So far, module works fine. Will update.Update - module still working with no issues. A good option for a permanent camera installation.",
