        "description": "The ONN dual 3'' LCD dash cam with a 120 degree wide angle lens ensures wider coverage of surroundings, & automatically records 1080p Full HD video while driving & at the same time records what is happening inside the car at 480P resolution. With its IR night vision, the cabin camera captures crisp details day & night. The cabin facing camera will provide additional security solution for recording videos for taxi or shared ride drivers. Loop Recording automatically overwrites the earliest file & records over it when storage fills up. With G-sensor enabled, the dash cam will automatically lock the current footage to prevent video from being overwritten when it detects a sudden shake/collision, which ensure important footage is protected . With the built in variable G-sensor, even when your car is parked, the dash cam will start recording video if your car is impacted (the impact level can be changed in settings) for up to 3 minutes. The Dash cam has a 16GB micro SD card included & supports additional cards with up to 128 GB of capacity. You can view the recorded videos (.MOV) by taking the memory card out of the dash cam & playing the content in compatible device or playback on the 3'' LCD screen.",

                "reviewText": "Getting the initial settings set up was easy/intuitive with settings buttons on the front of the camera and clearly marked. (Can't say that for another brand dashcam I owned, it was a mess). Nice, wide-angled front and occupant cameras. Comes on when it's supposed to, shuts down when it's supposed to. I did have to buy another/longer power cord to install the camera in my Ford F350 pickup, but I anticipated that. The suction cup mount with the adhesive cord holders keep the camera securely mounted. However, I wish the mount was configured/articulated differently to provide more flexible mounting options. As it is, I have to mount it kind of low on the windshield so it doesn't pick up the edge of the rear-view mirror or the blacked-out area at the top of the windshield. The camera itself, though, is top notch. Very pleased with it.",
