                "reviewText": "The set-up on this item was VERY straightforward, all you really have to do it pick the language you prefer. After that, make sure a micro-sd card is inserted and you're good to go.The camera quality is great on both cameras - the interior-facing cam has a wide enough angle that the driver, passenger and other occupants are clearly visible. The road-facing camera is good as well - things are clear and easily distinguishable, and the night vision on both cameras is stellar; I was actually really surprised at the quality of the interior facing camera, especially with night vision on! It was so bright and clear, I thought it was a mistake, lol.It comes with a dash mount and a suction cup - I've opted for the suction cup. The power cord it comes with is *plenty* long enough to run around the creases and seams so as to not be in the way.All in all I am pleased with this cam. I'm happy I waited and ordered this one, and have no desire for another.",

                "reviewText": "This is nice, but not a fancy, feature-laden dashcam. It nicely covers the forward view as well as in-cabin view with an option for adding a rear camera if you wish.Build seems fine and could take a knock or two. Instructions explain button purposes and screen symbol displays, but a lot is left to the user to figure out just by fiddling about and doing homework on the menu options. You can opt to record in different resolutions, adjust display of each camera, activate parking monitoring, and control many other options not covered by the manual. There is a 32 GB microSD card that is included to start you on your way, but getting a larger capacity card will allow more video before videos are overwritten, but it only supports up to 64 GB cards.Installing can be done using the double-sided tape on the windshield or with the included suction mount. The USB A cord plugs into your car's 12V DC lighter socket for power and the cord is very long allowing it to be run under your car's interior headliner, A-pillar, and dash crevices and they even include a plastic spudger to help getting the cord into nooks and crannies or removing interior clip-on panels. For a more permanent power option, there are fuse kits online that you can research or just take it to an auto store that specializes in aftermarket items.Quality is good and I haven't checked video in a lot of conditions, but gives you a sufficient record of what is going on around you that can help prove or disprove fault in various situations. Viewing the video can be done be shlogging through the on-camera menu or you can remove the memory card and download it to a PC to use with compatible software you can find on the webs. Exterior and interior cams are stored in two separate files. No fancy access to these through fancy phone apps with wifi access here.Overall, this is a good start to protecting yourself with a record of your driving. The weak instructions and clunky menu options can be overcome by exploring and experimenting, but the company should work on giving a better experience to learn about their product. Wifi or cloud access to your saved videos would be great, but at this price, it's no surprise it's not included. Start with this and upgrade later if you can't afford to jump directly to the next tier for a little better quality and experience.",

The power cord is nice and long so I had no issues getting it tucked in around the frame and plugged in and it starts up as soon as I turn on my car. It is also a really nice size and doesn't take up any additional visual space when driving.",

                "reviewText": "The Dash Cam arrived not DOA, but I was unable to get it to view anything and could not navigate thru the menu. I contacted customer service, PRAYING that they would be able to help, but this being what I thought was a Chinese product, I was not hopeful. To my surprise and delight, within a couple of hours, I had a reply telling me that they would do everything possible to fix my problem. The first attempt failed, and the next day, apparently as soon as their workday commenced, I got another reply, sending me files to put on the SD card to update the cam. That did not work either, and we corresponded back and forth 3 times over the course of a few hours. They then said they would just be sending me a new one, which arrived yesterday. It powered on immediately when I connected it and the camera worked this time, and I was able to plow my way thru the menu and set it up. It was unfortunate that the first one didn't work properly, for whatever reason. The instructions could be a little clearer, but I imagine a person a lot smarter than me wouldn't have much difficulty figuring everything out!! It's now in my car and working perfectly. Normally I would take off one or two stars for my initial difficulty. But the customer service that I received was unmatched by any company I have ever dealt with. I'm an old guy and I've been down this road with many, many other companies for lots of different reasons. So in summary, you have nothing to worry about with this product. It's functional and this company would get 10 stars for its customer service if I could give that many!",

The video quality is pretty crisp for how small it is and that\u2019s honestly a bonus because it really doesn\u2019t take up almost any FOV space.I\u2019m really hoping to never be in a crash, but I\u2019m much more confident about being on the road now that I\u2019ve got some video of whatever ends up happening :)Definitely recommend!",
