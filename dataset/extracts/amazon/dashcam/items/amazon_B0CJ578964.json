                "reviewText": "This is a bit different from other dash cams I own, both in some of how it functions, and in size. Which for me, is great. Because I have on car that is tiny with a small windshield, and also some motorcycles where I will use this. It makes my GoPro look like a monster, and weigh like one.In short, I'd tell you its small size is the big upside. Smaller than even my Rexing & Vantru (more or less twin) cams. Yes, those are both loaded with some added features, and both included and support good quality rear cams.But installing those cams can prove to be quite a job, and on another car (Jaguar XJL), frankly not possible due to rear sunshade. I'm not saying those are superb cams, but they were also just too big despite being fairly compact for my tiny Lotus.So I really wanted a cam for that car that took up minimal windshield space, and a rear cam just wasn't a high priority. So I gave this one a try. And so far, I'm very happy with it. I will say the image quality isn't quite on par with the Rexing/Vantrue cams.And those also offer a nice tilting lens, so you can ideally position that and the display for viewing. This one you just tilt the whole thing, so a bit of a compromise that might disappoint some users, but didn't affect me. With the cam pointed straight out, the display position for me is just right.This cam also takes a very different approach to internal power. Rather than a battery that, to be honest, will probably be dead in three to five years (summer heat and winter cold will cut that time down), this uses a capacitor. Or as the like to call it, a super capacitor.Either way, it stores energy when plugged in and then runs down like a battery. Only I'm quite sure its runtime is innately less once power is cut. That's not an issue in routine use, nor would it be in a crash. It will run for quite a while. But if used to record while parked, left at the airport for more than a day, it will probably die. Whereas a lithium battery would probably go longer. Just a thought to keep in mind.Again, doesn't really bother me. I don't leave my cars at the airport anymore. I take uber or a limo. Any other parking I do is just shopping or miscellaneous appointments, and only a few hours. Since my top desire was compact size, not long parked battery supported monitoring, this works just fine.I'm also finding a SD card of just 128Gb records a lot of days before it overwrites. So that's a good thing. I had a 256Gb card I could have put in instead, but just really don't find I'd need it. Formatting ahead of time is a bit of a twist. Most cams can format internally. But the instructions and process is very simply, and only needs to be done once unless the cars self-corrupts. Then pop it out, see if it will reformat, and if so, back to work.Understand what this cam does and doesn't do if important. But if windshield space is at a premium, and you don't care about a secondary rear cam or long-term parking monitoring, I think this is a winning ticket. It suits my needs just fine, and having other cams to compare with that are top of the line, I'd call this one a great little bargain.",

                "reviewText": "This little dashcam is absolutely tiny, I don't think I've ever seen one so small. The suction cup holder works perfectly, it holds the camera in place firmly, but you can still rotate the camera and adjust the angle in the holder, and even tuck it out of the way when you need to. It includes a more permanent adhesive holder if you prefer that, but I use the suction cup so I can easily swap it between cars and take it with me on travel to use in rental cars.Note: The camera requires micro SD cards, but the storage card is not included. I bought a couple of Samsung UHS-1 A2 U3 V30 128GB cards separately. The 128GB card records for several weeks of day-to-day driving before it reaches the the point where the camera starts overwriting.Note 2: the camera comes with a very long USB cable, and a USB charger that plugs into the cigar lighter. There is no hardwiring kit included. You need continuous power when the car is turned off for the parking monitor to work, so if you need that, you have to look for a hardwire kit separately.The view out front is panoramic, it really covers everything in front of you, and from the car hood to the sky very well. Of course, replaying the video on the little built-in screen is just for general video checking, you won't be able to make out any significant details. If you want to review the video you best use a computer to play off the video card.The picture quality is the main concern with dash cameras, and not just this COOAU camera, but every one I have seen or read about. They all mostly use one of the three main camera processors on the market, and all of them have the same limited video quality. In broad daylight, if you pull up to an intersection with a hanging street sign in front of you, you can read the sign in the video clearly if you are stopped and not more than 3 or 4 car lengths away. However, when moving or if you are more than 4 car lengths away, you may have a hard time reading the street sign in the video. At night, clarity is distinctly reduced.License plate capture, even in broad daylight, is a challenge also. When you are moving at a reasonable distance behind the car in front of you, it's pretty difficult to get a good read, but it depends somewhat on the road and the brightness. If you are more than a couple of car lengths away the image degrades rapidly. When you come to a stop behind a car, you can make out the license plate of the car in front of you, provided there are no bright reflections off the plate. However, reading the plate from a car in the adjacent lane 2 or 3 car lengths ahead can be difficult. At night, it can sometimes be better if there is good lighting because of the nice contrast of plate numbers versus the white background. But in most cases it is unclear at best and illegible at worst.The camera does have some nice features in the setup. You can stamp your license plate on the video if you desire that, but I don't. It allows you to set how many minutes each video segment can be from two to five minutes. The camera loops the video, so as you use up the space it will automatically overwrite the oldest video. However, it does not let you use up all the space. Storage cards are cheap, so this is not a big deal. The camera will also allow you to format the card on demand, so you can easily clear the content.Overall, I'm satisfied with the camera for basic recording as a way to have some record of any incident while driving. However, I hoped it wold have better picture quality. It would also be nice if it had a GPS location stamp on the video so you can easily mark the location of an incident. For the price it is decent, and will suffice for my needs.",

The digital menu is pretty easy to get through and I didn't have any issues with that. I thought there was a battery inside the device, but you need to keep it plugged in at all times or it won't work. Not a problem but I just didn't know. Great device.",

                "reviewText": "This unit is powered by a capacitor instead of batteries which allows it to operate in hostile cold and hot conditions. The unit comes with plenty of cord length for a large SUV. Limited menu options which are easy to use. The video quality on the device itself is pretty bad, but if you take out the memory chip and put it in your computer, its much better. The unit only po wers up when your 12V socket is energized and willnshut off immediately when the power is shut off. Its no go-pro by any means, but will produce a video good enough to show your insurance company or police officer if there is need.",

The picture quality is surprisingly sharp in both day and night conditions.The camera features a nice wide angle lens which easily captures all activity before the vehicle. The 2\" screen is easy to use even in bright daylight conditions, you can snap photos, The audio can be muted easily at any time with the press of a button.I like that the G sensor when triggered will lock the system and save the video file.In the 24 hour mode the camera will automatically capture video in the event of the G sensor being triggered or motion detection while being parked is really helpful!Now all is needed is the rear view camera!",
