                "reviewText": "There\u2019s much to like about the size of this dashcam, it\u2019s best feature. It is slim, inconspicuous, and the direct adhesive mount system is great - compared to the suction cups. Features are ok, not a lot of advanced technology in terms of audio, frame capture rates, etc. it works and for $99, a decent option. But I only use this for front facing and the occasional cabin view. That being the case - there are other options and better ones at the sub $100 price - eg from Rove. But the trade off is size - for more features and better technology. Of note - this dashcam is restricted to 4K when only the front camera is used. Once other cameras are used - the resolution drops. If you\u2019re using front and rear - two cameras sub $50 offering 4K resolution is another option.However - the biggest letdown here is the flaky wifi. I\u2019m on my 2nd unit and on the verge of sending it back unless I can figure out the randomness of the wifi working, not working, desire to be in 2 or 5 GHz mode.IMO - not very stable, there are better options. But the form factor is great - it\u2019s biggest advantage - but may not outweigh the down sides.",

                "reviewText": "Please don't go by the people's reviews on YouTube. Most of them have exaggerated the conditions and situations.1. The dash cam becomes so hot in the winter that it shuts down on its own. Not good if you are parking the car in the sun2. The new model M550 Pro has an issue with the software/firmware. Reboot several times for what not reasons. It restarted 30 times in 30 minutes.3. The inner camera with a C-type attachment flickers so hard that the dash cam reboots very frequently due to an error4. The dash cam doesn't work when both the inner and back cameras are connected. So 3 channels fail to work in the M550 Pro model5. The WIFI fails to connect and the dash cam reboots. I was not able to connect to WIFI as it rebooted every time I tried to connect6. Observed that GPS signals are feeble compared to an older model that my friend has7. The video had all sorts of noise, more than expected. Not sure how bad it sounds after driving8. The clarity on the back camera is really bad compared to an older model9. You need to install a hardware kit for parking mode to work. Without a hardware kit, it is just a toy10. There is no battery in the dashcam. Once you turn off the car the dash cam will shut down. If you use a hardware kit, that drains your car battery.Totally it was a waste of time, effort and money. Finally had to return this China product.Amazon sent me a PIN to receive the package which says it is a high-value product. Currently, initiated for a return with a refund. I will update this review on how the return works and the time taken to refund the amount.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:Electromagnetic installationCons:None so farRequires some extra wiring if your 12V outlet does not auto shutoffThis comes with a couple of electromagnetic pieces of plastic that adhere to your window without any glue and is surprisingly strong. You just wash and dry your window, place the plastic on the window and then stick the mount's double sided tape onto the plastic. If you want to move it you can slide the plastic around and easily take the plastic off without leaving behind residue or any kind of tape mess. I was impressed at how easy that was.You want your dash cam to automatically turn on when you turn on the car. If your 12V outlet is connected to your ignition then you simply plug in the usb cord to the included 12V car charger. My Ford Fusion is wired this way. My older Volkswagen Eurovan is not though. For my VW I would have to remember to unplug the dash cam and re-plug it in every time I drive. That's prone to forgetfulness. So I bought a fuse tap and wired a new 12V USB outlet to a fuse on my fuse box that is wired to the ignition switch. For me that was my car seat heaters. Alternatively, you can buy a Hardwire kit that will monitor your battery and turn off if the battery is low, that will also provide 24 hour recording - even when your car is turned off. I am not taking off any stars for this, as it is standard on every dash cam I have bought and really depends on what kind of car you have.The camera provides a very clear image and the inward facing camera can be easily disconnected if you don't want to record your passengers. My wife prefers not to have a camera pointing right at her face, so I'm glad that I could remove the inward facing camera. But that extra camera would be great for someone driving an Uber to record the passenger's activities. It can also catch a bit of what is happening out the side windows.I was happy to see that it came with a 64GB SD card. It's reassuring that this package comes with everything you need.",
