It took 20 minutes to install and most of that is routing the cables so the tabs on the cover fit without pinching the wires. The install video here on Amazon is perfect, It all works flawlessly. I would highly recommend if you have an auto dimming mirror in your car. Wish I could do this to the other car but it doesn't have auto dimming power mirror. Saves you from having to route the dashcam wires all over to get to the 12v plug.Ford makes most of their 12volt plugs have constant power, so if you forget to unplug dashcam in every time, it stays on and drains your battery. With this adapter you don't have to worry about remembering to plug or unplug your dashcam. Love it.",

This pigtail was definetly the ticket to a successful job. I pulled down the panel located above the mirror by pulling straight down. Unplugged the mirror connector and installed this pigtail inline. I did use a dremel to enlarge the small notch that the mirror wire exits from so my wires exit through the same hole. The pigtail did exactly as advertised, was small enough to fit inside the cover/trim, and was easy to install. What more would you want.",

No matter what the routing, you have to have the power wire to the camera run outside of the cover. The Mach e doesn\u2019t have a proper cut out to allow for that.",

                "reviewText": "I recently acquired this product, and it certainly serves its intended purpose well, with a few noteworthy aspects to consider.Pros:- This product does precisely what it's meant to do, providing a practical solution for managing your cables and keeping them organized.- It comes with three different types of USB cables, which is a nice bonus, ensuring compatibility with a variety of devices.- The inclusion of sticky clips for securing loose wires is a thoughtful touch, helping to maintain a tidy and clutter-free workspace.Cons:- One minor drawback is that the adapter could be a bit shorter. A shorter adapter would result in a neater and more compact fit inside the housing, enhancing the overall aesthetics of the setup.In summary, this product is a reliable cable management solution that does its job effectively. The inclusion of multiple USB cables and sticky clips adds value to the package. While there's room for improvement with the adapter length for a cleaner look, it's a practical addition to any workspace or home setup.",
