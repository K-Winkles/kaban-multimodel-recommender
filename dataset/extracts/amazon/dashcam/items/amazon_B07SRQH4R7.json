                "reviewText": "This is the 4th Viofo A119 V3 I have purchased, for myself and family members. These dash cams are simply great. Easy to install and set up and the video it provides is very, very good. I have had a couple of these in my cars over the past few years and have never had a problem with them. That is why I continue to purchase the Viofo brand dash cams when I need to (for family members), and have upgraded my A119 from a few years ago. The original was still working with no problems at all when I upgraded for my own vehicle. Never having to obtain warranty service for any of the Viofo cams, I am confident that if I ever need it, Viofo will be standing behind their products and will no doubt be very helpful. Viofo makes several different models of dash cams, but I can only vouch for the A119 models. However I am sure their other models are just as reliable as the A199's they sell. Prices are also good on their products. In my opinion, everyone should have a dash cam in their vehicle ... if you don't have one now, do yourself a favor and purchase one of the Viofo models. I am very happy with the A119 V3!",

                "reviewText": "The VIOFO A119 V3 2K Dash Cam is a feature-packed device that offers exceptional performance and impressive picture quality for the price. The setup was very simple as it was an adhesive mount and the cord given was certainly long enough to be hidden within the interior trim and still make it to the car charger port. The car charger supplied by viofo uses 2 ports so you can still use the port for your phone or other devices.The camera quality was as expected in a dash cam. It did a commendable job in capturing detailed footage. Compared to other dashcams within the price range, the Viofo A119 V3 does a better job at identifying objects and liscence plates. With that said, I would still say the liscence plate of the vehicle out loud as a precaution whenever something happens. The dashcam does a good job during challenging condition such as driving in a storm where the roads are flooding. The GPS Module provides accurate speed and loaction data.The dashcam was a lot smaller than I had anticipated which was good since it was unobtrusive to my view. This camera is a great option for budget orientated shoppers looking for a dashcam.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Impressed. Very good video.",
                "reviewText": "To begin with, like many of you reading this and other reviews, there are so many dash cams to choose from and you want the best bang for your buck. I read reviews, watched videos, etc... and did much research. One particular video compared many dash cams from $50 ones and up to over $300 dash cams. In the end, this VIOFO A119 V3 was highest ranked for affordable dash cams and had quality very close to the $300+ models. Well, I had to see and use it for myself....Unboxing, it was well protected and in taking it out of the box, it felt solid. It seemed well built and instructions were good.I installed it in my Tacoma and though I hate sticking any type of tape or products on my windshield, I took a chance without testing it first and stuck it on my windshield, wired it to my cigarette plug and hid wiring along windshield and down dash, etc... It was pretty easy to do and looks great. Barely enough wire to do what I wanted, but it was enough.Setup was pretty easy and after playing with different settings, frame rates, quality and all, I found that the default settings were best overall. Although some other settings looked a bit better for day time, night time quality was poor. The settings by default seemed to work best for both day and night. These settings were important to me as I go to work in the dark and come home when it's light.Quality of video overall were very impressive. Bright and pretty vivid colors in day time and night time looked pretty good too. Night time had a few more artifacts in the overall video, but that was expected and really did not hurt the quality much. Day time worked very well, though when you drive towards the sun, reflections can be an issue, but again, quality was still quite good. Not sure if a more expensive dash cam would be better or not, but quality was not poor enough for me to try other dash cams.Clarity when moving was good enough to see everything and wideness of the video was enough to cover the essentials needed in most situations on why one would buy a dash cam. As you travel, it was clear but clear enough as you pass road name signage and say, gas pricing on signs, but if you freeze the video, you can usually read them. I also travel in inner lane on a four lane road at 40 mph. License plates when moving were clear as you got close, but otherwise a bit blurry. But again, if you freeze picture, you can usually read them. This includes cars you pass or are passing you and the ones in front of you. I really have nothing to compare to, except Go Pros, but in videos I have seen on internet, the videos this camera shows are so much better than most I have seen. Travelling at slower speeds, you were able to read signage a bit better. Even though some signs were a bit blurred, overall video quality is very clear from slow speeds to highway speeds.It does not come with a memory card. I purchased the Samsund Pro Endurance 256gb and it has done wonderfully. 256gb is biggest card the camera can take according to manual. You need a card that can take the use and heat of the camera and elements and this card was recommended. It is easy to put in and remove. I did this many times as I tested different settings and viewed on computer. The size of this card is great as it will hold over a week of my driving habits before overwriting older videos. I was able to do this with camera mounted. You can also easily unmount and mount camera from windshield as needed.I would highly advise to buy the polarizing filter for this dash cam as the quality improves tenfold. I tried video with the polarizer and without. The quality is so much better with the filter and the $15 or so extra for it, is very well worth it.I would recommend this VIOFO A119 V3 dash cam for anyone wanting a good quality camera with very good video overall for an affordable price. You buy one too cheap, quality is usually horrible. Buy an expensive one, video quality may be a bit better, but is it worth the 3X price tag? I'm very happy with this camera and have not looked back.NOTE: I have not tried the parking settings, nor do I have it hooked up that way (you can buy a wiring setup to enable this camera to be used in this matter).",

                "reviewText": "Update 5/22/2023,After the initial review, I had a few conversations with the company's CSR, and they were able to provide additional support and replaced the broken dashcam under warranty. While it is unfortunate that my original dashcam broke due to normal use, it's rare and refreshing for a Chinese company to actually stand by its product.Hopefully, the replacement dashcam will last longer than the last one.Original Review,The VIOFO A119 V3 dashcam is a complete disappointment, especially since it died after just one year of use. Despite its promise of high-resolution video and advanced features, the camera is simply not built to last.The camera's design is flimsy and lacks durability. The plastic housing feels cheap and lightweight, and the camera's mounting mechanism is prone to wobbling and shifting during use. This can cause the camera to become disconnected from its power source, leading to loss of footage and eventual failure.Furthermore, the camera's software was also problematic. It frequently froze or crashed, leading to lost footage or corrupted files. The menu system was confusing and difficult to navigate, and the camera's settings were not intuitive.Despite these issues, I was willing to overlook them because of the camera's affordability. However, I was extremely disappointed when the camera died after just one year of use. The camera simply stopped working and could not be repaired. This was a waste of money and a major inconvenience, as I relied on the camera for my daily commute.",

So we are now happy to gossip in the car about everyone!Also we didn't activate the GPS attachment, as we live rurally and sometimes our speed might be slightly over the limit on empty roads. The Police don't need to know that.Anyway this is an excellent very little and discreet camera that we don't even see when we drive now.We hope that it will save us in Court one day :)",
