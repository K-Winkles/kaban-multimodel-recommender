                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Why did I not get one sooner?!",
                "reviewText": "I had been planning on getting a dash cam for about a year and just couldn't settle on one. But after watching so much DDS, MegaDrivingSchool, Sergey22, etc. on YouTube, I decided on a VanTrue. The day after I made my decision and started seriously looking for one, an older gentleman pulled out of a gas station while not looking my direction and SOMEHOW, at less than 15 mph, totaled my car. I am still in disbelief! I went home and purchased this right away.I love it! High definition, high quality clips that you can set up in 1, 2, or 3 minute loops. Night vision is great. Some people have complained about the mount included (slipping) but mine has been on for several months in a Sacramento summer and now cold, wet weather with no change in position. I did get the GPS mount (tracks speed and coordinates) but haven't set it up yet.The inside facing camera is great, definitely keeps you more aware and tuned into the road knowing you have a permanent witness with you. Lol. But it doesn't just see inside, it's clear enough to see behind me as well, though mainly larger and more obvious details like car type and color rather than license plate numbers. The front camera gets plates, bumper stickers, signs, everything else though. It lets you take pictures in addition to recording manually. Parking mode is easy to set up and you can set the G shock sensor to a very sensitive setting but thankfully, I haven't needed it yet.All the settings are easy to set up, uploading clips can be done by taking the card out of the camera and uploading to the comp or the easier way, detach the whole camera (very easy to do by pushing a little lever and sliding it off) and connect using the USB cable. The playback is smooth and seamless, audio is not the best sometimes but I bought a camera not a microphone so I can't list that as a genuine con. However when it's really quiet (no radio, late night driving) you can even hear the blinker and windshield wipers going. Hit or miss.A card is not included, and when you buy one you need to format it before inserting it and recording. Very easy to do though, and my 256 GB Samsung (from the \"recommended with this purchase\" section) works great. Holds hours and hours of video so I can record as I please without running out of space or overwriting videos which is what happened with my last camera (gifted.... it broke). That being said, there is a note about the manually recorded/\"event\" videos potentially being overwritten once you hit something like 70% capacity. So if you care about that, stay on top of extracting your videos.My ONLY con after owning this for probably 3 months now, is the actual initial set up. It comes with all the cables and cords necessary to hook it up via the cigarette lighter port thing (idk) *but* the plug they gave me was too big for my port. Like, way, way too big; there was no realistic way it could fit in my 97 Honda Civic, so just keep that in mind if buying for an older car. I have a stereo/deck with a USB port so I can connect the camera to the power source that way using the USB cable meant for the computer, but it hangs down from the windshield and sometimes gets in the way, either of my hands or the inside facing camera. But again, only con here. Doesn't affect the operation and it was an easy fix. I've never bought a piece of technology that hasn't given me problems within the first 1-2 months but here I am reviewing the exception.Let me tell you, the piece of mind this gives you is overwhelming sometimes. I can't tell you how many times I've de-escalated someone else's road rage by simply pointing to the camera (or prevented my own by remembering it's inside watching me too! Ha!). Plus, I've caught some funny, unique, and just plain weird things on it, like a semi on fire on the freeway, a murmur of birds by the river, a troop of turkeys 45 strong fighting in the middle of the road, a crow dropping a rock on someone's windshield and cracking it, a homeless man pulling his sweats all the way off to tie his shoe in the middle of the road then pulling them back on to keep jay walking... Excellent gift for paranoid, angry, or new drivers, Lyft/Uber drivers, or just anyone with long commute who sees more than the average driver. You can't beat the price for the quality and customer service. 10/10 would buy again",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Quality Video, Great Build Quality, Extremely easy to use, Tons of Features. Very Highly Recommended.",
                "reviewText": "Short and Quick Version:> Very highly recommended. Don't mess with cheapos.> Setting up is extremely easy. Matter of fact just pop in Micro SD card and that's it.> Video quality is great. Tiny LCD is very useful. Cabin camera and Audio recording work great.> The size is really compact, almost disappears/blend in front of the room mirror and behind the glare of the front windshield.> Quick Start guide may be all you need and it's in English !!! (NOT Chinglish :P)Now, this is for those (like me) who like to do a bit of research before purchasing anything.I am not going to go in fast shipping the nice packaging and all that. That was all great! But I am going to break the review down to what I was looking for in a dash camera.SIZE: I was totally amazed by the size of this thing. Did not expect it to be this small and compact. That was one of my main concern while purchasing a dash cam. My car has been broken into once and the dash cam was stolen. And I think that was mainly because the camera looked just like a GoPro (Yi Smart Dash Camera). Anyways, I installed it right in front of the room mirror and it's really hard to tell if there is something in there or not. It blends with the black back of room mirror and the glare of the front windshield really helps, making it a nice stealthy camera.BUILD QUALITY: When you are spending like $200 you expect quality. And I have to say this camera is very well built and feels the premium product in the hand. Only time will tell how well it will do in this hot summer and coming cold a$$ winter. But I have a positive feeling that it should definitely hold up.SETUP: I received my order right before I was leaving to run some errands. I really could not hold myself, so I opened the box turned the camera on and I was on my way within 3-4 minutes. It was super easy to set up. Basically, I did not have to do anything. The factory defaults were just perfect, I basically cycled through all the settings a couple of times and that's it. It has two different places to attach the power cable (nice and long!), on the side of the camera or on the windshield mount! Very cool! So if I wish to take the camera out or detach for whatever reason (data transfer), it is very convenience to do so. The attachment works great.* The date format is DD/MM/YY which is annoying for me. Common you guys, this is US MM/DD/YY is what we understand here.VIDEO QUALITY: This is the most important factor when it comes to dash cam. Without a good quality video, the device is useless. I have been recording only in 1440p and it looks really great. I can read license plates just fine, the FOV is enough to cover a good amount of front of the vehicle and night vision is not bad at all (a lot better than I was expecting - not the greatest for sure).* One gripe about the resolution of the video is you can only record in 1080p 30 when you are also recording cabin (inside). The 1080p 60 and 1440 30 is useless if you want to record inside as well.DATA TRANSFER: This is really not of my concern at all, because you can pop out the Micro SD from the camera and/or detach the camera very easily from the windshield mount. However, they use Mini USB port, which IMO is ancient. Good thing it comes with a cable and the Micro SD I purchased also came with an adapter. Once again really does not matter but a Micro USB or even Type C would have been great!EXTRAS: The camera has few more extra features which could be useful for some people. Snapshot, Timelapse and the Parking Mode. Because it has a built-in battery it will record while the vehicle is parked. Timelapse looks really amazing and could be really useful say if you are a Vlogger or just want to make a video of where you going or even what is happening in front of you etc. The User Manual is actually very very useful and totally in English (LOL). It's not Chinglish, great work you guys!FINAL THOUGHTS: I am glad I purchased this camera instead of messing around with cheaper options. And I highly recommend it to anybody who has a need to record cabin and audio as well as catch those idiot drivers out there. I am giving it Full 5 Stars.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Was introduce by a friend to this dash cam that they have very good quality and good price for the built and specification, so i gave it a try. Below are my true review.Order on sat and got it on monday afternoon, very speedy delivery.First unbox of the dashcam got my surprise with the built quality of the dashcam, just like what my friend recommended. Box was well designed and packed, the dash cam itself its design and built with quality housing, camera lens is good too with both dual camera for front and back for in car view. We have the option to ON/OFF in car camera. Both lens quality is good, very clear and sharp video. I have attached a sample clip from my dashcam.The configuration of the dash cam is very simple to operate, its very easy to mount and dismount if you require to view the video clip. Just a simple press and slot it can be easily remove and mount, love this features.I might be considering getting the GPS unit for location tracking and speed displaying with simple top up of $20. It's another good thing about Vantrue as they design parts into modular to reduce selling price as some of us may not require of the parts so we do not need to pay extra for something that we do not need to use.HIghly recommended for anyone looking for a good and simple dash cam with modular add on anytime they required.",
