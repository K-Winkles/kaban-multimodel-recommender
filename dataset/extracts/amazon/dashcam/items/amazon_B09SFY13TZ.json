I often find my dashcams lying on the seat or the floor after a hot day. So I contacted RedTiger and asked if they had any other methods of attachment. They guided me to this mounting bracket that uses 3M tape to permanently attach to the windshield.Suction cups are great for people who move the camera from car to car, but I keep mine installed all the time. This little mount is fantastic. The camera is secure no matter what the weather. And a big thank you to RedTiger for their customer service. I am very happy.",
