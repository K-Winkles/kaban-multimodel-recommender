                "reviewText": "I have been wanting to get a hardwire kit for my Vantrue N4 Pro dashcam for some time now, but have been dreading trying to access the fuse box on my Mercedes as they (purposefully) do not make it easy. So I've been holding off which means I've felt like I've only been getting half the use out of my dashcam. Without the ability to power the parking mode, the dashcam completely shuts down when the engine is turned off. Plus, I'm not terribly crazy about the plug permanently sticking out of the lighter port as it looks out of place and often pops-out with the normal motion of driving shutting the camera down.So when I saw this connector that was USB-C to OBD, I was absolutely thrilled.To be honest, I wasn't even aware that connecting to the OBD port was even an option, so this was a very nice surprise. Prior to running the cable, I plugged in both connectors with the car off just to make sure it would work. Happily, the camera powered right up with no problem. So working back from the original cable, I was able to simply push the new cable in as I removed the old - following the same path under the trim. The cable to this connector is a little thicker in diameter than the temporary cable, so getting it fitted around some of the curves was a little more difficult, but in all, I had the full cable run in about 20 minutes.I was a little concerned that the cable connects to the OBD head on the opposite side of which the cable had to be run, thinking this may leave a visible loop or slack since the cable was run from the right, but terminates on the left. Fortunately, in my case at least, the cable was just the right length to make the run, so there was no extra slack and the installation is rather clean.An added bonus - and a feature I didn't even know I wanted until I had it - is the toggle switch on the OBD connector allowing you to cut power to the camera when it is not needed. I love this feature as my car is often securely garaged for extended periods, so there is no need to run the camera and potentially drain the battery in these instances. This toggle switch is a great feature allowing me to enable the camera while I'm parked in public - or if I were to ever be pulled over - but disable it when garaged at home.Given how happy I am with this set-up, it is easy to say that I highly recommend this OBD cable and would go so far as to say that I think its an even better choice over the fuse box option.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to power an Android Auto/Apple Carplay device in my Rivian and while it does work in that I am able to draw power from the OBD port, apparently, the port is always fully powered and I can't get the screen to turn off. I tried the switch on the back of the unit in both positions but it made no difference at all, the screen just wouldn't shut off. So, clearly this would be great functionality for powering a dash cam or something that needs power all of the time but doesn't draw that much power but it's not for my use case. It was super easy to install and I did like that it came with the few extras that it comes with. I'm just going to have to find another way to use it since it doesn't work the way I need it to in my vehicle.",

                "reviewText": "Currently this cable is less than $15 and I could not be happier. The whole thing feels well made for the cost and it works exactly as described. I am using it to power my dashcam as my car shuts off acc power when it is turned off and it works flawlessly to keep everything running. I also wanted to be able to still use my OBD port while not having to plug and unplug this cable so I paired this with an OBD splitter that allows 2 things to be plugged in at once so I can run a scan tool and this without putting added stress on my OBD port by plugging and unplugging over and over.I love that it has voltage monitoring and the switch to go between ACC and Constant. That way, if I'm parked in the city I can leave the dashcam running but if I have the car at home in the driveway, I don't need to leave it running and it isn't a hassle to quickly change what I want it to do.Overall a great cable and a great price.",
