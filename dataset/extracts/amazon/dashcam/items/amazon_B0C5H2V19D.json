There are a few things worth mentioning - both cameras are great during the day, however as with other cameras there is a challenge capturing a moving liscense plate more than a car length away. The nighttime video is great unless there is a light nearby and then the quality decreases somewhat - this seems to be an issue with any camera. For the price this seems to do the job quite nicely.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: I have tried six times over two months to get pictures added to my review, but Amazon keeps denying them for unknown reasons and they will not respond to my support requests about it. Sorry there's no pictures to see what I'm talking about.It's a really interesting kit that sounds great on paper. I also noticed that the really long power cable is made with a super nice, supple, and thick coating! The cable for the third/rear camera is pretty typical PVC stiffer coating, but also fairly nice.As with so many dash cams, the forward facing and rear facing cameras cannot give a clear picture of a license plate beyond maybe a car length and a half, possibly two. So far I\u2019m also disappointed with the low light performance despite having WDR turned on, but maybe I need to fiddle with the settings to get it to do a bit better. My Flex is pretty long and I\u2019m having issues figuring out how to run the cable for the rear camera as it isn\u2019t long enough to route very nicely. The video quality is also not stellar for the rear and looks worse than the front cam facing cam. The interior cam has the worst quality by far, but for the most part should get the job done.Generally setting it up and going with a SanDisk industrial microSD card was simple enough. The suction mount for the cam seems quite stable and has held for over a month with no signs of letting loose despite the camera being in the hot sun often. The manual and accessories are quite good overall. I feel like it\u2019s a nice intro level triple cam setup, but really would like a little more clarity on license plates. I did find it a bit odd that the file types vary depending on the camera. The front and inside are MOV while the rear cam is AVI format.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this camera for few months now and I can say that it is good enough for insurance claims and disputes among parties but not so good for a hit a run.First the good and the like....> The back-up camera comes with a cable long enough for a standard car but for my truck I needed an extension cable. no big deal and was able to easily find one that worked flawlessly.>The booklet says that the cameras stop recording when you are backing up and have the power lead hooked up for the camera to operate as a back-up camera, but my camera continued to record all three cameras. That is good.> Simple set up and running the cables as desired.> Cost effective way to protect yourself on a tight budget.The Bad...> Sometimes the camera would just stop working for no apparent reason. The first few times this happened I touched the camera and it was hot so I thought this was the reason. But one time in the cool evening the camera stopped working and just gave me the blank screen while i was driving. But the camera was cool when I touched it, so who knows why the camera stopped. The GOOD NEWS is that the camera will reset by itself or you can manually reset the camera (see the booklet for instructions). For \"automatic\" resetting of the camera without a factory reset I found that I just need to disconnect (pull out the power plug) power to the camera and wait until the camera cools down and then try to reconnect power. Sometimes I just wait overnight and the camera is ready to go the next day with all my previous settings.> I tried two sim cards. One card wrote at about 100mb/s speed (32GB) and the other wrote at 140mb/s speed (256GB). The 140Mb/s gave me a slightly better quality at playback than the slower card. I recommend getting the fastest reading card you can find/use for the best results.BUT the overall quality no matter what card I used was still so so. The camera took great still pictures and the video looked great while the vehicle was stopped, but once the vehicle moves the quality suffers no matter what speed the vehicle was traveling at. Reading details like license plates becomes difficult if not impossible however the camera still recorded with enough clarity to see and determine what is happening.> NIGHT TIME - Forget it. once there is a headlight or street lamp you will not see anything but orbs from the lights. You could still piece events together but it will be difficult with all the light orbs. When there are no light shining at the vehicle then you can see a little of the night events but still not great.",
