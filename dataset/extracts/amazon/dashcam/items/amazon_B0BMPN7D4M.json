It isn\u2019t easy to find another one to replace it and I had to buy a couple and use pieces to make a new one cuz guess what? The tape didn\u2019t hold up through even 2 days! The pic and functionality are great! Just the mounting issues. I wish it came with a suction cup option and not the cheap double sided tape",
