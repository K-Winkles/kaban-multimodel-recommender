Additionally, the loop recording feature ensures old files are replaced by new ones without taking up memory space. The G-sensor system locks specific files or data for added security and peace of mind. With its built-in WiFi feature and free AZDOME app, users can easily access their videos on their iPhone or Android phone while on the road. Warm Tips: 1. The packaging does not include a memory card; you will need to purchase a Class 10 U3 Speed SD Card with a maximum support of 128GB. Avoid fake memory cards and format your SD card with your dash cam before first use. Search ASIN: B09K78CNM8 2. Use external power while using the dash cam since the battery is mainly used for emergency file saving purposes only. Parking Monitor requires continuous power and an AZDOME JYX02 3-lead Mini USB Hardwire Kit (not included in packaging). Search ASIN: B096G6FKZP 3. If you want to install the front camera on your car's rearview mirror, consider purchasing our Mirror Mount Holder (not included in packaging). Search ASIN: B09J58VZ6Z 4. Although loop recording is set up, it's recommended that you format your SD card every four weeks for smoother operation. 5. We provide updates for dash cam firmware and accessories. 6.

I was previously using Magellan, Garmin and a Viofo over the years and the viofo was way too complicated requiring formatting to fat32 which I couldn't ever figure out, and the fact it never recorded when I needed it to, so I got this one. WELL it was great having an easy to use dashcam and the peace of mind knowing it would be a witness when needed, well thats until the POS doesn't work. I was involved in an incident today when a box truck blew a red light without warning and almost killed me. Told the troopers that I have it all on dashcam. So I go to review it and what do you know, it recorded all 83 minutes of my 90 minute commute this morning EXCEPT the 7 minutes I actually needed. To add insult to injury it even recorded me taking it off the windshield to play back the video \ud83d\ude44. What use is a dashcam when it doesn't do its job? I've bought 4 of them to put in our personal cars and 7 for our company, I will be replacing them immediately. Don't rely on this garbage",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Took a bit to figure things out, and that is coming from a senior lady, that gets easily frustrated. I did read other reviews, because those are usually quite helpful, with extra tips. You do have to turn your mobile data off, to connect to the camera. Not really a big deal, but it won't work if you miss that step. To connect the app to the camera to see videos, you have to be within 10 ft of the camera, so to download, you'd probably have to be in the car, with the car running, so there is power to the camera. Downloads take a bit, so patience is needed. A long video would probably take quite a while, but I haven't tested that yet. The daytime video quality is excellent, in my lowly opinion. Nighttime driving is rare for me, but I will update as I figure the camera out more. See the video, and judge the quality for yourself. Will be back soon with updates.Second update with a night time video. My windshield was a bit wet as you can see in the video, but the video quality at night is fine.Currently on sale for 50% off. I bought a decent mini SD card from Amazon, and didn't have any problems formatting it. 08092023",
