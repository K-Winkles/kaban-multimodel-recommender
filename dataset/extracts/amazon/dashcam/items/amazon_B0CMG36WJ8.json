In addition , this dash cam at least includes a memory card. I do wish it was a higher capacity card as 64 GB is too small in my opinion. That being said, the dash cam does incorporate loop recording so when the card is full it will start overwriting. The upside is that it overwrites the older recordings first.The additional features I liked was the parking monitor which I consider \"must have\" in a dash cam.This unit also functional well at night. The footage, whilst not perfect, was above average. I found the wifi capabilities to be one of the best things about the dash cam. I was ability to easily connect it to my phone, download recordings, which is exactly what I need to be able to do, if I have to submit video evidence. You also get to see other information, in the app, such as speed, location and other details.Overall, this is a great feature rich dash cam, that was easy to setup and use. The negatives are that It does not record inside the car nor does it record the rear which would be useful if you are read-ended..",

                "reviewText": "Unfortunately I had some issues that I wasn't comfortable with in attempting to use this device. First of all... the camera, mounting bracket, cable, supporting materials & documents seem well put together. Here is where the issues begin. On the side of the box and on page 24 of the instruction manual there is a QR code to scan in order to download the supporting App from either the Apple or Android App stores. When I scanned the QR code on page 24 with my iPhone, I got a message \" No Source Found\". The scan on the side of the box takes you to a website. Then I typed into the search bar of the Apple App store \"AutoSky 4K Dashcam\" again nothing was found for a Dashcam. Then I emailed their customer service for assistance. To my surprise, I received a reply in less than a minute advising me the App is called \"Vidure\" and a link for the App. Normally I don't click on suspicious links but I said what the heck I wanted to use this cool dashcam. I downloaded the Vidure App to my iPhone. After reading the \"Privacy Policy\" I was again feeling uncomfortable and a little suspicious of the App. It wanted me to grant permission for personal information, (although they won't share) access to all images the camera would capture as well as GPS data. It also wanted me to connect the camera to my home wifi network in order to proceed any further in setting up the camera. Additionally, there was no mention of \"AutoSky Dashcam\" anywhere that I read in the \"Privacy Policy\" of the Vidure App agreement. So I immediately removed the App from my iPhone and as a result I am unable to use and experience this Dashcam. Now... AutoSky if I am mistaken in my review, please correct me. I would like to use your Dashcam. AMAZON... you may want to look into this product a little further for authenticity.",

The cable is long and I was able to route and tuck it neatly alongside the windshield and down through the passenger seat and to the 12V lighter port. I would recommend testing out the view of the camera before attaching it to the windshield. The image resolution is fine during day and night. 64GB SD Card is enough if you don't need to review footage more than a week. Overall, this dash cam is compact and the setting up was a breeze.",
