                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Surpassed my expectations",
                "reviewText": "Pros: I like almost everything about this little cam. It has tons of features you can tinker with, but it also works right out of the box, just by plugging it in. Very little work to get it up and running. I also bought ROVE's memory card, which worked without any issue. The software and instructions/documentation are fantastic - very clear and well thought-out, which is rare for electronics these days, with most stuff being made overseas by folks who don't know English well. This camera is designed in the USA, manufactured in China - like Apple products. The unboxing experience was surprisingly fun, and obviously Apple-inspired. Build quality looks really solid - I see no flaws. Camera is very easy to mount. ROVE even included cleaning wipes for my windshield in the product packaging! It's little touches like this that show they put a lot of thought and care into this product. It's also really easy to get the videos onto my computer; I appreciate the no-hassle experience.?: I haven't tested the night vision yet. One other feature I'm excited to try is time lapse mode.Cons: The camera stops recording as soon as the engine is turned off. I understand why it is designed this way. But I want to be able to record while I'm pulled over with the engine off. For example, if a police officer pulls me over. Cops usually tell you to turn off your car engine. If you do that your camera shuts off and you'll have no footage! ROVE sells a kit that allows you to hook the camera up directly to your car battery, but I worry that will drain my battery; might be better for owners of electric vehicles. The other major flaw with this camera is that it only records the forward-facing direction; if someone rear-ends you, you won't have any footage of it (you'll need to buy a whole second camera for that). Finally, the built-in speedometer seems to be biased 1 or 2 mph too fast, imho. That's going to make you look bad if you try to use the videos in court - it makes you look like you were driving faster than you were! There ought to be a setting to tune this up or down 1-3 mph. Fortunately there is a setting to just turn it off.",

                "reviewText": "It arrived in a nice box and well packaged but you can tell it's a cheap product by the really odd wording on the box like \"smart and beautiful rove app for IoS and android\". The mount is really cheap too. The camera feels cheap like a 35 dollar dash cam I had prior. I'm willing to overlook that if it works when I need it to. I've owned Magellan dash cams, Garmin, Viofo and Azdome. Was really let down with all of them except for the Garmin, but that lacked image quality.The suction cup mount is a little bit more sturdy with less side to side flop. The image quality is good though, the app so far has worked well. Was easier to set up than some of the other dash cams I've used. I have high hopes for this one I picked it over the rexing because they kept talking about formatting in fat32 and I won't buy a camera that requires formatting on a computer in a different mode before being able to use it. Anyways I think the price for this should be in the $60 range",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars SOLID, RELIABLE PERFORMANCE",
                "reviewText": "Summary: the R2-4K Pro is a straightforward 4K dashcam that does only that job but does it very well without extra bells or whistles. Easy to set up and use, good video and photo footage, solid apps, excellent customer service, and an attractive price point, especially for 4K. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to a friend.Key specifications and features: video up to true 4K ((3840 x 2160 @ 30 fps), photos up to 12Mb resolution, time lapse photos at 1, 2, and 4 fps, 150 degree field of view, 2 band wi-fi, GPS, and parking mode with G-sensor (cam \u201cgoes to sleep\u201d when parked but records again if it detects motion or if something hits the car with sufficient force - note that this requires the optional hardwiring kit). This dashcam can\u2019t connect to a second camera or upload videos or photos directly to the cloud. There are no safety features such as lane departure, collision, or speed trap warnings. Menus are logically arranged and easy to navigate. A micro SD card (up to 512 Gb capacity) is required to record and must be purchased separately. Rove recommends their proprietary card and warns against using SanDisk and Samsung cards.The cam comes with a 12 volt power cord, suction cup and adhesive mounts, with 2 sheets of electrostatic windshield film for use with the adhesive mount. The cam is adjustable vertically and horizontally. The user manual, 4.5\" x 6\" and printed in color, is reasonably well organized and has useful information, but, due to its size, some of the images are too small to read without a magnifying glass. The binding is weak; after less than a month, the pages are starting to separate. How-to info for the smartphone and desktop apps is marginal.I paid about $170 for the cam, a 256 Gb memory card, and circular polarizing filter. I installed it plugging the power cord into the car\u2019s 12 volt power outlet. The cam turns on and begins recording automatically when the car starts but must be turned off manually. I haven\u2019t hardwired the connection, so I can\u2019t use the parking mode and G sensor features. I first set video resolution at 2K (2560 x1440) and then at 4K; photos at 12 Mb and time lapse at 4 fps. All settings gave what I consider useable footage in daylight. I did not see much difference between the 4K and 2K video, maybe because I do not have a 4K display. I have not used the camera yet during night driving. Playback is smooth and uninterrupted on the device and the smartphone and desktop apps. Settings are easily accessible from the camera while it is installed. The cam is easily disconnected from the mount. The connection points are plastic, so I wonder about durability and whether metal points would last longer. I\u2019m not sure the filter was a good choice; its effectiveness changes as the camera\u2019s angle to the sun changes which, of course, is constantly while driving.So far, customer support has been superb. Phone support is available but Rove encourages use of texts and emails. Rove has responded to each of my emails in less than 48 hours with on-topic information.",

After installing the Rove unit, reading licence plates is a piece of cake. Using the iPhone app to manage the camera is intuitive, and retrieving videos is extremely easy.
