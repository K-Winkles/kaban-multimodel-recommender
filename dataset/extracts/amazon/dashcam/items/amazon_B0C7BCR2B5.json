                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the YEECORE dual dash cam Model# H22, Real 4K+1080P, front and rear, built-in Wi-Fi GPS, 3\" IPS screen, HDR night vision, 24H parking monitor, wide angle, and G-sensor loop recording. I can confidently say that it's one of the best dash cams on the market for cars. It has amazing features, including dual recording, super night vision, loop recording, built-in GPS, Wi-Fi app control IOS / Android true WDR, HDR, time lapse, G sensor, 7/24H parking mode, screen saver, H.265 advanced video compression and 512GB max storage capacity.What sets this dash cam apart from other models is its real 4K+1080 UHD resolution. The incredibly super clear images even in low extreme light conditions. In addition to the front camera capturing an ultra wide angle view of the road ahead, the rear camera also provides ultra wide angle coverage. The HDR High Dynamic Range technology ensures that videos are balanced even in the low light or exposure conditions.The YEECORE 4K+1080 Dual Dash Cam also comes with built in Wi -Fi and GPS capabilities.

I hate to pull out the microsd card to download the footage\uff0cbut this camera can using the app on my phone, it\u2019s easy to find whatever event I need to view and save, easy to provide this to the police or insurance.Setting it up is a breeze: simply plug it into the cigarette lighter, attach it to the windshield, and you're ready to start using it. The only challenge is managing the cables if you want a tidy setup, but overall it is easy to install. If you want to hardwire it into your car, you will need an additional wire. Also the camera mount with the the tape, I feel the stickiness better than suction cup mount.highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "This is my second dash cam of a different make to install in my other vehicle. I really like the dash cam. It was easy to install. Taking my time to run the cables, install and set up the dash cams took me about an hour. Some others may be faster. Picture quality day and night is fantastic. The camera and app are very user friendly where downloading and using the app is a breeze. The front dash cam swivels and can be moved up or down for viewing preference. The back dash cam is also able to move for viewing preference position. I highly recommend buying a U3 card that is at least 256mb or higher to be able to store more recordings and set your recording loop for 1 minute for faster downloads. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because in the video library, it does not have a visible date/time stamp to easily retrieve and view a recording for downloading if needed like my other dash cam does. Definitely an inconvenience if there are multiple recordings in your library and you are trying to find that recording that occurred at the time you are looking for. It would be a huge benefit if the manufacturer can push an update to the system that fixes this date/time stamp issue in the recording library for user friendliness. This is a very good dash cam and if you decide to purchase this one, you will be happy with your choice. I am.",
