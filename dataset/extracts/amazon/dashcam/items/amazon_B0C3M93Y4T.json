Took us around an hour to set up and get all the cable management going so that it wouldn't look like a giant eyesore.You can't access any of the recordings unless you're actually in the car, which is a major nuisance. Over all it seems to have more cons than pros. It doesn't do parking recording, so if anything happens to your car while it's parked, that's too bad. It is small and compact and you get two. One for the rear and one for the front, which I really liked that, but again, there are so many little inconveniences that just add up. I would call this an interim dash cam. A dash cam you use while you save up for a better one.",

                "reviewText": "I installed the Azdome M301 dash cam inside my Toyota Corolla.The installation was simple, and everything needed including the Micro SD card were part of the package. It took me less than 30 minutes to complete the install (still need to clean up the wiring though).To access the dash cam and make any changes to the configurations I had to connect my iPhone WIFI to the dash cam. Doing so disconnect the phone from CarPlay and disconnect you from Internet.Pros: - Compact design - Front and back cameras - All the parts are shipped with the unit including a 64GB Micro SD card (it supports up to 128GB of class 10 Micro SD cards) - WIFI capable - Good operating temperature (-4F to 158F) - G-sensor will lock the recording in event of collision to protect it from overwritingCons: -No GPS data (locations and speed) are part of the recording - No internal battery, Most of newer dash cams comes with an internal rechargeable battery that continues recording for hours after engine is shut off. You need to purchase a wiring kit and install it before using the parking mode.This dash cam has voice command support although Voice control is only limited to 7 commands and not always working.Overall, this is a good dash cam that does the basic and very comparable to other dash cam at $40 price point. Note the list price is $69 but there is $30 coupon that makes the final price $39.99. Recommended.",
