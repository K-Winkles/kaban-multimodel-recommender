                "reviewText": "For what this cost, a few gallons of gas, it could save you thousands for someone's mistake. Or a ticket if a cop is wrong. This is almost a required accessory today.The quality is more than sufficient. At night, the display looks clearer than looking thru the windshield. Videos are saved in 3 minute intervals. Comes with a manual explaining all the features, and a REAR camera for this price, which is almost unbelievable. It can work as a backup camera too. Picture quality among even expensive cameras is similar, but they may offer more features that may or may not be useful.I would suggest a \"durable\" SD card (inexpensive) and a hardwired kit (optional). The vendor has an email and they send you a 64GB card if you contact them, but to be safe there are \"Ultra\" SDs made for dashcams (this would be true for any brand). Probably good to change once a year.The app can also do real time recording, so if really want peace of mind you can use that feature.Requires a \"trapezoid\" shape mini-USB connector for power, comes with an adapter. Only Con would be the adapter that needs a round 12V port, but there are other options for this. I could not imagine being without it for what it cost.",

                "reviewText": "Front and Rear dashcamOverall this is an inexpensive but functional dashcam with rear camera. It has average picture quality but is good enough to see what's going on. It will definitely be able to prove the accident wasn't your fault.Installation is easy with the included suction mount. I prefer something more permanent that has no chance of coming loose or falling down in a critical situation. I also purchased a hardwire kit to hide the power cable and connect it directly to the fusebox.Everything needed to get it working is included, along with the memory card. How well rated this micro SD card is for high and low temps a vehicle interior can experience are unknown, but typically most dashcam manufacturers recommend a high-grade card. The included one doesn't seem to have any of the ratings to indicate it's more than just a bog standard version.It claims to have a force sensor to secure the video in an accident so it isn't erased by mistake. A great feature if it works.Dashcams are like insurance, nice to have but hopefully never needed.",

It mounts easily enough and has a long power cable. I was not able to use the rear facing camera as the cable was not long enough - but that was an issue with my vehicle being too large (van).If you need a cheap camera to get you a dash cam, this is it. But don't expect high quality videos.",

The cords provided for both the front and rear camera are long and reached where I needed them too just fine. The memory card included was ready to go without formatting, although I still did. The suction mount is easy to use and stays in place well. The rear camera is a little bit more difficult to install, but it does come with adhesive pad and screws. The picture on the camera is great. It is better than the other dash cam I have. Super clear and crisp. The camera powers on when I turn the car on and records automatically. I would recommend this camera dn rate t at 5 stars.",
