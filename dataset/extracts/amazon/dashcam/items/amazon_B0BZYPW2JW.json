I had to go in a business trip for over a month and my wife started using my car leaving the SUV at home. Two days pass and the SUV battery is dead. I'm not at home, we have to call home mechanic and he charged the battery and sayd he couldn't find anything wrong. A week later same thing, we replaced the battery (a good one, we later find out) thinking that was the issue. Few days later again. I told my wife to keep using the car until I get back. Since it was a new battery I took it to the car shop for warranty. They said the battery was fine just under charged. I told them ok but that they must honor the warranty in my next visit. So I head to the mechanic for a electrical system checkup and, off course, it came out good. Then I came to realize that the only thing done before issues started was to hot wire the dash cam with this... kit. Since we had the camera for over a year I re-plugged the original power cable and left the SUV seat for a whole week and it started without hesitation. I hot plugged back with this product and within 48 hours the battery was at 9.15VDC Unfortunately the return period is long gone and I have to keep it. With the back and forward we spent almost $400. Oh boy!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this kit after reading good reviews.I'd previously powered my dash can through the 12v socket between the driver and passenger seat in my mk 7 Golf GTI but wanted to tidy this up with a permanent install.Before attempting the install I watched a few YouTube videos on how best to fit this to my model of car.On receiving the kit I found that the magnetic interference piece was missing so contacted the supplier who quickly replied and offered a partial refund with which I purchased my own.The rest of the kit seems to be of very good quality, with various fuse types to connect to the fuse box.I decided to attach to a fuse with a permanent power feed as my dash cam (Goluk T1) has a setting that automatically turns off the dash cam after the car has been stationary for 20 minutes and so far it has performed faultlesly.I'm planning to test the Parking monitoring setting on my Goluk T1 dash cam soon which would have it looping video and saving clips when either the vibration or motion sensors are activated whilst parked. This will then test the hardwire kits function for turning off power to the dashcam before the car battery gets too drained to start the engine. I will update my review at a later date to confirm how this performs.So far though really happy with my purchase, would have been 5 stars if the magnetic interference ring had been present and would have been less stars but for the suppliers quick reply and rectification of the issue.I would recomend",
