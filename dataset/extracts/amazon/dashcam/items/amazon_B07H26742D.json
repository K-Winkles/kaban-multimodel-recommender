There are several months worth of random getting in and out of the vehicle but there are very little recordings of us driving. So basically when you hear the camera start up it records for a short time then seems to shut off until you stop the vehicle and then it begins recording you getting out of the vehicle. Not happy. Not impressed. Would not recommend!!!",
