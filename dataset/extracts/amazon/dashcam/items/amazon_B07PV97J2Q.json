                "reviewText": "The camera I purchased and wanted was a corded camera that plugs into the side of the Nextbase 522 or 422gw dash-cam. With roughly 22 feet of cord, this camera will easily meet your requirements for installing on any foreign or domestic passenger vehicle. As one of the reviewers said \"test the cord and camera first to confirm functionality prior to running the wire and camera in your vehicle.\" I used the little cord tool device that came with my Nextbase 522gw dash-cam to hide the wire in between the ceiling of my car and the pillars, and opted it to trail the wire down along with the cord that connects my OEM mirror on the front windshield. The camera itself has a base that has 3M foam tape that appears flimsy, but has held well now for over two months to the rear window of my car. I recommend the following:Do a dry run - try leaving the cord out and using the camera while driving prior to doing the final install (In case you don't like it)Plan the route of your cord, this helps with detours and having to take the wire down just to restart again.If you have a lot of excess wire left over, coil it in several paces rather than at the end or beginning - otherwise the wire bunches up, pops out, or pushes against what ever you place it behind, I had roughly 18 inches excess, so I coiled 6 inches at the end, middle and beginning, this way if I wanted to move or have to get around it later, I didn't have to deal with a big mess/re-running the whole cord.Do test runs and compare your video - make sure your camera is pointed to optimally catch the whole rear view, at first I had almost all pointing to the passenger side, then not enough on the passenger side.A few things I found out after setting it up:There's a picture in picture on the dash-cam screen when you plug this camera in, it pretty makes it impossible to look at the screen when driving (distracting). I found hiding the dash cam behind my rear view mirror helps and turning on the screen saver.Now you'll have up to four video files of the same time - depending on your settings there will be two videos one of the forward facing cam and one of the rear view, not the actual picture in picture as stated above.The camera captures video well even with window tenting, this changes at night depending on the ambient light/street lights, etc.It works well for what I want, I haven't had to use it as far as a car accident, but it brings me piece of mind. The manual states that the sd card should be formatted routinely (dash cam internal feature)I hope this helps",

                "reviewText": "I bought the dash cam, the rear window cam and the hard wire kit. The installation was easy to do, neat out of the way and mostly well hidden except for the wires at the tops of the windshield and rear window. I ordered some small 3M cable clamps to stick at the top of the windscreens to take care of that. There was no way for me to shove the wires under the window trims without breaking something.I chose to use unswitched power for the setup. Power is always available even when parked. If someone were to bump the car or worse if someone tries to break in, the cams G sensor gets triggered, the cam turns on and records the event. The rear window camera is very useful for backing up. The field of view to the rear is wide enough to see most things on your blind spots but as expected not all. Still this is many times better than just the mirrors. I like the rear view feature so much that I leave it on all the time. It's great for monitoring cars in your blind spots in the city and the highways.I have only one small gripe. The daytime view of the display is a little too dim for my old eyes. That's probably because I enabled the light sensor which will automatically adjust the brightness of the screen to the ambient light which is great for night driving. I wish there was a way to customize it.So that's it folks. Buy it!",

This rear view camera is intended to look out the rear window. There is also an identical looking back up camera intended for viewing the interior of the car as well as a camera which mounts directly to the rear window. The latter is more difficult to instal and probably intended for larger SUVs. The system as whole works great.",

But the 622GW does not know the rear camera is attached. No picture in picture. NOTHING! It just doesn't work. Did a reset, Nothing! Tried it with and without the SD card, Nothing! Either this rear camera is crap or the cable is crap, or both. I JUST WASTED MY MONEY. And there is no option on Amazon to contact the seller so I can exchange the unit.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have had this camera attached to my NextBase 322GW for 16-months.If you want a discreet, tidy installation with the cable hidden as much as possible, then this is more challenging than for the front-facing camera because that cable has to travel a long way. But with patience and a little forethought I'm happy with how it turned out.I had to get a new micro-SDHC card because adding this camera to your main camera you need a FAST high capacity card inserted or the rear camera just won't be recognized.After installation, everything is just set and forget, and the video quality is IMO perfectly fine. For each minute of video capture you get two files on your SDHC card labelled e.g. 220814_093026_332_FH.MP4 and 220814_093026_332_RH.MP4. With my video settings the front camera file occupies about 112MB, and the rear camera file is 61MB.EXCEPT for one very irritating design flaw. The camera attaches to its rear windshield mount by magnet. But... the camera is spherical, and there is nothing to lock it in a fixed position. It is free to rotate around like an eyeball in its socket. So after a while with the normal vibration and bumps of driving, and opening and closing the tailgate, the camera ends up pointing all sorts of weird angles. Maybe a spot of hot-glue will be a semi-reversable solution?",

It\u2019s small and does not interfere with vision. Need to look at wiper sweep as first time fitted centre but wiper missed in rain. So have moved over to one side for best vision when raining and wipers on. Would recommend",
