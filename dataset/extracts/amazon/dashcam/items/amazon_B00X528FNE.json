                "reviewText": "This was very easy to install. It comes with an adapter that uses the cigarette lighter plug. But that would leave a wire hanging down from the windshield. I don't think the power wire is long enough to run around the edge of the windshield, unless you had a very small car with a very small windshield. Instead I spent the extra money on this: Dash Camera Vehicle Hard Wire Kit - Mini USB Compatible with G1w / G1w-C / G1WH / GT680W / Mini 0801 / Mobius Action Spy Tec Camera and More | Car DVR Camera Recorder Dashboard Dashcam | Black Box Video Recorder | and this: Pico 0956PT 10 Amp ATM Mini Blade Fuse Add-A-Circuit Fuse Holder The hardwire kit will work with this camera. The Add-A-Circuit should be vehicle dependent...so be sure you get the one that matches the fuses in your car. The one I posted here should work a lot of cars, but you should double check. It's much easier than just jamming the power wire into the fuse box like I used to do.Anyway, with those parts the install was easy. The camera itself seems to work great. I haven't had to go back and use the footage yet...but I've checked the card a few times and it's recording fine. BTW, as other reviews mention, get the 32GB card max.The settings out of the box are fine...I didn't change much. But the manual is actually very good (nice surprise) and it's easy to change anything you want.I had been thinking of getting this for a while, but never pulled the trigger. I was riding in a car the other day and it was struck by a guy driving recklessly. Fortunatley it wasn't my car, and I wasn't driving (and no one was hurt), but I remember thinking that if there was a dash cam installed, the issue of who was at fault would be much more simple. I pulled the trigger that night, got the camera in 2 days, and was up and running a couple hours after that. Worth it for the peace of mind.**Update 4-18-16**I've been periodically checking the SD card and the recordings are sporadic. It will record for 5 min, then it stops and doesn't start a new recording. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. Also, the other day I saw someone driving crazy on the highway, I hit the red button to save the file, but when I got home, it wasn't saved. So, it only records sometimes...which is definitely NOT OK for something like this. The point is to have a recording when you need it. With this unit I have no confidence that it's recording.Maybe my unit went bad? At this point I would not buy again.**Update 7/9/17**I kept this unit going until I sold the car recently. Here is what I found over the past year. The type of SD card you use seems to matter. I don't recall what SD card I was using initially, but something about it was not compatible with the unit. I cheaper card seemed to work much better. The biggest issue is that cold temps prevented my unit from working. The unit won't turn on until the temp inside the car is warm enough. I don't know what the unit has inside for power (battery), but whatever it is, doesn't seem to work when it's cold. So the first 15-20 min of each drive is not captured until the unit warms up...in the winter only. Aside from that, it seemed to work OK. I'd still keep my 2 star rating. In my new vehicle, I'll look around a bit before installing this again.**Update 1/21/2020**Rexing has been contacting me about some of the negative issues I had with my unit and sent me a new unit to replace my old one. This unit is an updated version and seems to work better than my original unit did. No problems with the recordings or power like I had before. It's a good unit and I'd recommend it for sure. Form factor is the same as the previous version, which is good. Some units look big and clunky, like a go pro stuck on your dash. This fits nicely behind your rear view mirror and is not visible at all. Good unit.",

                "reviewText": "I've used this dash cam for a few weeks now, and I've got nothing but praise for it. The first unit I received had an issue with the USB power slot on side of the device. I returned that unit through Amazon and received a replacement that has worked splendidly. Some summary thoughts are listed below.Pros:- Amazingly wide viewing angle.I really underestimated how wide the angle on this thing is. I initially mounted it right next to where my rear-view mirror was attached to my windshield. However, the corner of the video was blacked-out, as it somehow caught the mirror mount which I believed to be directly lateral to it. Consequently, I had to get another mount from Rexing and move it over a few inches. Rexing was very responsive and after a re-mount, the recording was unobstructed. It captures everything that you can see ahead of, and diagonal to your own point of view.- Easy to navigate menu.I've seen a few other dash cams, and this one has a very simple and intuitive menu and settings compared to the competition. I had no issue figuring out how to configure the device to my liking. The manual provided is clear, and actually in English. I had previously purchased a budget dash cam that had a manual that was in broken English, and completely unintelligible. No such issues exist with this Rexing model. Every setting has a brief description that actually makes sense.- Clear, actual HD picture.The picture quality on 1080FHD mode is excellent. I have a 32GB card in the device, so storage isn't an issue. Other cameras state that they capture in FHD, but this one actually DOES. The difference between this camera and budget models is night and day. I had no issues making out license plate numbers when reviewing footage. I trust that with this device, I'm getting a quality unit. I originally purchased a much cheaper device, thinking that it would be unlikely that I'd ever have to review the footage. I do not regret upgrading in the least. I consider this my second insurance policy on my car.- Camouflaged.When mounted around the rear view mirror, this device is very difficult to notice. Unless you actually point it out, folks in public will never know it's there. Rexing did a great job of designing this to fly under the radar. Cons:Supplied Plug/Cable -The device comes with a ~15ft cigarette adapter power plug that has a USB port built into it. I preferred to use a slightly shorter and thinner gauge mini-usb cable. This is personal preference, granted. The stock cable also has a 90* bend at the base that plugs into the device, but the bend goes downward toward the dash, not upward toward the headliner. This should be reversed to more effectively conceal the cable.Mount -If you screw up mounting the device the first go-round, you'll need a new mount and 3M adhesive pad. The included sticky pad is amazingly adhesive. This is great, in that I know the device will never suddenly fall off the windshield. However, removal is very tricky. Plan on measuring twice, and mounting once. Again, Rexing kindly supplied me with additional mounts. Perhaps they should consider adding an extra to the box. Additionally, cable clips would be a nice touch, too!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The first highlight of the product is its size and shape. It tiny as a pebble and its shape indeed makes it a disguise.Second, people might have their preference for the suction mount but for me, it works the best. It doesn't obstruct the field of view. Moreover, the stuck one is more reliable in winters less prone to vibrations.Third, the interface is very simple. You don't need too many controls while you are driving anyways. If you do need, the wifi pairing does the job.I am yet to validate the quality and performance against the cheaper Chinese versions. They are feature-rich and better value for money (on paper at least).[Update], For the price I would give full score to the image quantity. It also picked audio very well.The buying experience with Amazon has been always been top-notch. The product arrived the next day (in less than 24 hours). Well packaged and bundled with SD card (that I ordered separately).",
