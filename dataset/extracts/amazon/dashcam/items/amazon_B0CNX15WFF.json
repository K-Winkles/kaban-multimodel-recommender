                "reviewText": "I\u2019m really liking this dash cam so far! It\u2019s small and sleek so it doesn\u2019t distract when on the dashboard. The image recorded is crisp, clear, smooth, and widescreen. It captures nearly the entire front window in a very clear image. I do wish that it had a battery so it didn\u2019t always need to be plugged in, as the cable is a little bulky hanging off the dash. But I do like that it auto turns on when the car starts up, so I guess it\u2019s a trade off. And you could always hardwire it to hide the wire better.I also wish the app was Bluetooth instead of WiFi as I don\u2019t love connecting to generally unknown WiFi networks. But the good thing is that you only need to connect to modify settings or to review footage. It will turn on & record once powered, even if your phone isnt connected. It records right to the sd card (great that it\u2019s included!) and can be reviewed either in your computer or via the app on WiFiWhile there are some changes I\u2019d like, I\u2019m still quite happy with this dash cam. My first test with it was a 5hr drive and it performed perfectly.I\u2019ll be adding a suction Mount to it to make it more versatile. But very pleased and would recommend it to others.",
