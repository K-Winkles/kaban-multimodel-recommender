The video quality is as good as any other dash cam I have owned, but I don't spend hundreds of dollars on them either. This unit will do the job very nicely and paired with the Eonon Android head unit, it is a must add on.Oh, and I tried a high quality Samsung 64GB SD Card in it and it would not recognize it. I guess the 32GB limit is a hard limit, but still, 32GB should be plenty of room for several hours of recording before it starts over writing the old footage.",

                "reviewText": "Great price. It is good for capturing live footage. Captures the music playing in the background. Has a good steep angle view in my 2004 f250 to see well ahead.32gb max micro card limit isnt bad. It uses a push in, push -in- further to release memory card. I read a review that one person had to take the entire unit apart to retrieve their card. Probably didnt push the card in further enough to spring the card out. It is a cheap unit ($30 including a sandisk 100 speed card). Buy a card and only take it out if needed?Good quality in the unit and how it records. Apk is already loaded in the internal memory of the camera and you access it the way you would with an attached memory card to install it's app (called traffic cop I think)Only records 3 mins at a time. Should have option to record entire drive as one file, or max at 30 mins.Ties up a usb port, no other options, the data port on the radio. Glad the radio works with wireless android auto. It would be hard for me to give up the data wire to wired android auto in my worktruck if that was my only option.I drive to 10 places per day. The traffic is getting worse in my area, and so is the caliber of driver. I've seen people pass school busses stopped letting kids off. This should be helpful for the police to properly conclude what happened, as long as it survives a hard crash. No reason to think it wouldn't.",
