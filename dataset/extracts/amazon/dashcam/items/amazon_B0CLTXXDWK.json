                "reviewText": "Installation of the front camera, rear camera and hardwire kit in a RAM 3500 crew cab pickup took about 3 hours. All of the supplied cables were more than long enough to use in a vehicle that size. Getting the cameras up and running after installation was really straightforward. The picture quality, day and night, is excellent and I would buy the 70mai A800S again. That said, nothing is perfect and so I found things that need to be improved. #1 on the improvement list is the setup instructions. During setup the user is given several options. For instance, options for video length and options for how long the camera stays on when you exit the vehicle, however, the instructions give no information to help the user decide why you may want to choose one option over another for your particular situation/needs. #2 on the improvement list is the 70mai app. The app does allow you to connect to the A800S internal WiFi and it does a good job of allowing you to view video saved on the SD card. The issue I have with the app is that it takes way too many keystrokes to be able to view a saved video. It seems that every user command input simply brings up another warning window that the user has to clear to finally arrive at being able to view the saved video. A little information about video playback. On my first attempts to view recorded video from the SD card, both on my iPhone XR and on my laptop, the video quality was lacking. The video had a somewhat 'liquid' look to it, a sort of motion blur. The quality was good enough to show what happened leading to a traffic incident, but impossible to get any detail like a license plate number or road signs. I replaced the SD card with no improvement so I actually thought the camera was defective and requested a replacement from Amazon. Before the replacement arrived I found the answer to getting clean, crisp video from the SD card. I downloaded a VLC media player to my laptop and when I played the saved SD card camera video using the VLC player, BINGO, clear crisp HD video! I have now purchased a Lightning to SD card reader from Apple (about $30 on Amazon) and downloaded the VLC media player to my iPhone and iPad. If I want or need to view clear, crisp HD video I simply remove the SD card from the camera, insert in into the Apple card reader and play it through the VLC player on the phone or iPad.",

                "reviewText": "This is the second camera I have owned from 70mai. The first being the pro. I had it for several years, and t still works. This is a major upgrade. The GPS is built into the camera instead of the mount and includes the rear camera. I had an issue with the GPS on the pro because of it being in the mount and having connection issues. I do not expect that issue with this model since it is built into the camera. However, the camera itself worked flawlessly for the 4 years I had it. I expect the same, and the rear camera is a must. I have already had a few close calls that were inches away from needing the footage from drivers trying to fly around me while I was merging. Do yourself a favor and buy one of these. I've seen them on sale here at times for $100, but even at full price, it is well worth it to protect yourself.",

Controls are easy to use, I love the form factor and the screen is angled good to be fully usable.One, well, two, issues, both with retrieving videos using my Galaxy phone:The card is not formatted in a standard FAT32 style, but close. Using a card reader, it is almost never properly seen when plugged into my phone, and when plugging it into my PC I have to re-plug it two or three times before it'll be seen as a usable card. And attempting to use wifi to download to the phone absolutely failed several times yesterday (fortunately, it was only for something I was interested in seeing rather than something I needed to save).No battery or super-capacitor, it turns off within seconds of losing power so if you want to keep recording when stopped, leave the engine running or hardwire it. And turn off the parking detection as that will turn it off a few minutes after it detects no movement.",

It keeps going into emergency recording mode every time I hit a bump in the road and actually tells you it is doing so, which is annoying. And while it is in this mode you cannot do anything else. The worst part of all is you cannot get any help. The \"manual\" is quite brief and the app is not helpful with installation either. Definitely will be sending back ASAP",

I've been able to record clear footage of accidents and other incidents that happened at night.The app is also pretty easy to use. I can easily view my footage on my phone, and I can also download it if I need to. The app also has a built-in editor, so I can trim and edit my footage before sharing it.The only downside is that the rear camera is not 4K, but it's still good enough for my needs. I mostly use the rear camera to record traffic behind me, and it's more than capable of doing that.Overall, I'm really happy with the 70mai A800S. It's a great dash cam for the price, and it's definitely worth considering if you're looking for a high-quality dash cam with good night vision.",
