                "reviewText": "This was a Christmas gift for a family member (my husband) with whom we share the same vehicle.I carefully read ALL the reviews about this product before purchasing it, both good and bad (and in-between as well). I was optimistic this dashcam would be a good choice, especially for the lower price point and with features only found on much higher priced dashcams. I must've gotten one of the duds!Installation was a breeze with great instructions. This was NOT connected to the fuse box which would require additional purchase in order to bypass the power cord for 24/7 \"parking\" monitoring. We just installed with the power cord hanging under the rear view mirror until we were certain it was what we wanted, then we would have purchased the kit for permanent mounting with constant power via the fuse box but it failed before that step was ever an option. I'm glad we didn't install it as a permanent dashcam since it would have been an additional expense for nothing.Camera on this dashcam seems to record absolutely amazing quality pictures and videos (when it did work for a week) but since Installation there seems to be something that's gone completely wrong because it has gone from being a great dashcam to an annoying piece of useless equipment!The dashcam has never been in the vehicle with any accidents, it hasn't been dropped nor exposed to extreme temperatures either. It hasn't been touched since installation where it worked great for a week but now this ANNOYING voice keeps repeating \"VIDEO LOCKED\" ......\"VIDEO LOCKED\"......\"VIDEO LOCKED\".I removed the SD card which was purchased along with this dashcam as a suggested purchase addition that was recommended for this dashcam (Samsung SD card) so I tried removing the SD card that was purchased with this dashcam and put in one that was also new but had never been used. I unplugged the dashcam from the power cord and even uninstalled the app, then started over as if doing installation for the first time. Still the same annoying \"video locked\" voice every few seconds at random \"cluster events\", even with the vehicle sitting still! I assume it's somehow glitching as if it's been involved in an accident or \"event\" since apparently that's when a video will automatically lock on this unit, yet this has never been in any accident nor anything remotely silimiar to what it could possibly conceive as an \"accident\", such as stopping suddenly or abrupt and fast acceleration. There's been absolutely nothing that this unit could have interpreted as an \"accident\" or \"event\" that would prompt the unit to \"video lock\" so often and so randomly.Since it was bought the beginning of December 2023 for a Christmas gift for a family member (my husband) and it wasn't installed until February 2nd, 2024, the window for returning it has long since passed. Lesson learned!I've spent far too much time on trying to \"fix\" this issue with basic troubleshooting, all to no avail, so this will be tossed into the electronics recycle bin since it's useless as it is. I'm glad it wasn't over $50 but still it's a loss nonetheless!Perhaps I just got one in the bunch that has a manufacturing defect, which happens and it is totally understandable, but it is what it is.I can't in good conscience leave a 5 star review when this unit is malfunctioning.It may very well be an awesome dashcam, as so many people have reviewed as such, but for our family, getting a few days of incredible video footage when this did work well, to a week later having it fail, it just isn't worth a 5 star review, sorry. It would have been great to have the experience like so many others have reviewed with this dashcam, but ours just wasn't a good experience. It was great for a week, even night vision video was mind blowing for the price of this little dashcam but not just for a week of use.Into the electronics recycle bin it goes.",

The camera comes with the static adhesive pad and the claw tool to help wedge the cable for an inconspicuous installation, it could've been 5 stars. However, the automatic greeting playback when starting the vehicle...boy, oh, boy... it IS extremely annoying and it cannot be disabled; which is sadly why I took out one star. In my case, well, I will be replacing it; but there is no rush. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this simple, efficient, great video quality, and overall budget-friendly dash cam.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE this camera! It works in every level of light and the picture is clear. I love the peace of mind I have knowing that there is a camera on board with me. I did not hard wire this camera into my car so the only annoying thing is that my car must be on to view the videos recorded. That being said, it was really easy to install, though there was some user error in getting the camera placed where I wanted it. The cord is long enough to go from behind the mirror, across the windshield, down the frame, under the floor mat and plug into the car charger. Sometimes I think about getting another one for the rear view, but I don't know if they would both work on the app.",
