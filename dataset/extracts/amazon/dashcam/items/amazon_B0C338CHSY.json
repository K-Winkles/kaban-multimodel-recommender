The front dash cam is very simple to set up and connect with the app. The quality is pretty good and is nice to have as a piece of mind. However, the back dashcam is a lot more work and can even require some modifications to your car so I have not installed it yet. Everything feels well made and I have not run into any problems with recording or anything. Good relatively cheap dash cam.",

The fact that it has both front and back is great but keep in mind you do have to run a wire from the front of your vehicle to the back and that can be quite a pain to hide the wire.We got this for my husband's truck because my car already has a dash cam and I have found it very valuable for long trips (and short ones for that matter). The main issue we have with this is that it mentions that it has the option to run while parked which is a great idea, however, you need to have an extra kit to do this because you have to run a wire all the way to your battery in order to keep the camera working while the car is turned off. I'm not sure that part of it is worth the effort and we will likely not set it up but if that is something that appealed to you about this product note that you will have to take these extra steps.",

                "reviewText": "When considered as an entire package, this is a pretty good dashcam/rearcam combo that should suit most peoples' needs. The camera is fully featured with tons of neat stuff including an adjustable G-sensor (hard braking, impacts, whatever), time-lapse settings for when the car is parked, and of course, a generously-wide viewing angle on the front with the appropriate screen. Its overall size is compact so it won't get in the way or be obnoxiously distracting. The device comes with a 64GB card for storage, but the device can support up to 512GB.Managing the cameras is done via your phone or tablet through an app and by establishing a connection to the camera's local network. From the app, you can extract videos as desired. The physical display also has a handy physical button to snap photos on demand without having to open the app. Pretty much all of the available features are listed on the product page, so if it all appeals to you, then you're off to a good start.I found that the auto exposure adjustment was pretty good which is important for night driving (when you're most likely to get into an incident because of them unruly nighthawks) and the video quality was excellent. As far as features and functionality go, I was pretty impressed by this device.That said, a few things I didn't like which aren't necessarily dealbreakers, but definitely noteworthy. First, this thing runs hot. The page says it's supposed to run hot, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. It makes me worried about longer road trips, for example, or just the heat wearing the thing down in general. A heatsink would have gone a long way to solve this problem for a minimal cost, but alas. Second, the rear camera is hard wired, which is to be expected, but again, I am not a fan. Moreover, they suggest you run it through your car and drill holes into your trunk/hatch to hang the camera from above your plate. Perhaps if I still had my older rusty bucket, I wouldn't have minded, but my car is only a few years old; I'm not putting holes in it for anything or anyone! However, you can get creative and just point it out your back window instead and you'll be fine. Cable management is an issue, too. You're going to figure out how to deal with the two cables coming out of the display; one for the rear camera and one to reach your cigarette lighter power supply port. Moreover, they recommend even more wiring to make the most out of the parking settings. Meh.Overall, I like what's here and I am creative enough to work around its limitations. That said, I think there's too much expectation for you to make modifications to your car just to get this thing working as they recommend it - it's not necessary and you can definitely work around it, but the audacity to expect that this is something everyone will be okay with doing is just wrong. Also, it wouldn't have killed them to add a heat sink to the main unit. But either way, having this camera set is better than having none at all. Protect yourself and drive safe.",

                "reviewText": "I recently got my hands on this new dash cam, and diving into its features has been a bit of a journey. At first glance, its compact size caught my attention. There was a moment of doubt, wondering if such a small device could deliver on its promises. But after setting it up and taking it for a spin, I discovered that the video quality was genuinely top-notch. Both daytime and nighttime recordings showcased clarity and detail that I hadn't anticipated. Especially during evening drives, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it adapted to changing light conditions, capturing crucial moments with precision.The user interface was intuitive, making the initial setup and any subsequent tweaks almost effortless. It felt like the device was designed with the user in mind, considering how quickly I could navigate through the settings. I also found out that the storage capacity was more generous than I had first assumed. The continuous loop recording feature meant I didn't need to worry about frequent manual deletions. It seamlessly overwrote older recordings, ensuring I always had the most recent footage at my disposal.One of the standout features was the automatic incident detection. During one of my drives, I had an unnervingly close encounter at a busy crossroad. Without any prompt, the dash cam instinctively saved that segment, providing a sense of security, knowing I had that clip safely stored should I ever need it.However, no product is without its flaws. While the video capture was commendable, the audio aspect had room for improvement. The built-in microphone managed to pick up conversations and sounds inside the vehicle adequately, but it struggled a bit when it came to external noises. Road sounds, other vehicles, and general ambient noises sometimes came across as muffled or distant. It's not a major downside, but for those who value crystal clear audio alongside video, it's a point worth noting.Considering it needs to stay plugged in, I had to be mindful of how I managed the cable. A neat installation ensured it didn't become an obstruction or distraction while driving. This, however, was a small trade-off for the peace of mind and functionality the dash cam offered.In wrapping up, my experience with this dash cam has left me mostly satisfied. It's a blend of impressive video quality, user-centric design, and some smart, thoughtful features. The few areas where it could use some enhancement are relatively minor when weighed against its strengths. It's a worthy companion for anyone looking to document their drives, whether for safety, accountability, or just capturing scenic routes.",
