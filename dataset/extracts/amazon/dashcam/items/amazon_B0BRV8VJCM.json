                "reviewText": "On the camera I received, the SD slot is very mis-aligned with the case, so when I put the SD card in, it just vanished inside the camera and is rattling around. There is no way to open the camera to get the SD card back out. The \"App\" that comes with is not in the Google Play store and Android flagged it as a potentially harmful application. This was a Christmas present, and I regret buying this.UPDATE AS OF JAN 12, 2023 - The Seller sent me a new camera quickly which worked as designed. I ended up breaking open the old one to get my SD card out, rendering it useless. On the new camera, the picture is clear, the menu items make sense and is fairly intuitive. Other rear-cams get power from the main camera, but this one requires to tap into an existing wire. In my car, it's actually a bundle of wires, so it took a bit to find the right one. It did make me nervous to pierce a wire, but it worked. I took the SD card out and view on a computer and the image quality, even at night is pretty good.",

Tried checking everything, wire is good camear looks to be undamaged, it was working just fine one second, then just stopped the next. Caused the front camera to keep going on and off until I unplugged the rear camera front camera still works though. Also can't get a replacement rear camera or wire. So it is useless now",

I am very satisfied with this good quality and cheap dash cam. And the seller can solve your questions well and quickly. I recommend it to you.",

I have not picked up any detection motion unless I literally wave my hand in front of the camera. I would not recommend.",
