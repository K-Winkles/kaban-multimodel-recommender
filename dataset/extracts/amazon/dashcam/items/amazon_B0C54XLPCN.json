The new video overwrites the old one. Is the video of the car camera clear enough? This upgraded dashcam records very clear video, and it is small and easy to install! In what cold and hot weather can the dashcam be used? Will there be any damage? Dashcams use supercapacitors, which, unlike batteries, pose no danger of overheating or exploding. The operating temperature of the recorder is -4\u00b0F and 155\u00b0F, at which the recorder can work normally. Are the three dashcam cameras working at the same time? How does the rear camera record? This dashcam has two screens that work on the screen at the same time. If you don't install a rear camera, it will only record two front and interior views.",

                "reviewText": "This product does met what\u2019s said on description. Just a piece of junk. I spent over 1/2 day took cover off run cables found out quality videos just blurry and horrible picture color like back in the 60\u2019s movie definitely not 4k quality. Web description said front cam 4k, cabin cam 1080p and backup cam 1080p BUT actually when I downloaded videos front cam 1080p, cabin cam 640p and backup cam 720p very frustrating me, plus buttons on camera very hard to press. Also videos show front cam recorded full screen but cabin & back cameras recorded split screen.",
