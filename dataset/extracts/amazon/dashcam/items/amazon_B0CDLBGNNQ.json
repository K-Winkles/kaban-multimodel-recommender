                "reviewText": "Works very well. Installation isn\u2019t real hard with video reviews and planning. Cameras work very well and images are sharp. I like many of the features. Easy app to smartphone with WiFi, set up with multiple features. I put one in my Toyota Camry and another in our Subaru Outback. I bought a multiplug adaptor for the cigarette lighter feed for the outback and have run the power cord to the inside of the console. I like the little tune it sends when it is turned on or off. Changing the screen is easy with 5 options. Downloading images or videos is easy as well as taking a snapshot. The loop recording feature is very good! I have it set at 1 minute, but 2 minutes and 5 minutes are options!! Price is very good for features offered, and all the wiring is included except for an alternate power source to operate the parking monitoring. The wiring is there to make the rear camera work in backup mode. The windshield suction mount is extremely well made, no issues if windshield is cleaned well before installation. Would I buy it again? Yes! Bought 2 to start with and am very pleased!",

The ability to grab videos or screenshots off of the dashcam without pulling the memory card is very handy.The quality of the video and screenshots are decent for what you need and its not bad to install, no better or worse than installing any other dashcam.I do dislike having to install a special app for everything nowadays, but I get it and its worth it to have access to the cam when you need it, like after an accident or incident.",

The rear camera cable wasn't long enough to reach the back bumper of my Tacoma after going thru the head liner & down the left A post thru the fire wall and followed factory wiring to back bumper. I emailed seller and they sent me a longer cable no problem & no cost that's a A+ for the seller. Daytime clarity of the picture is better than my older cheap camera & rear view as well. Have not tried it at night. So, all & all I'm satisfied with it for the cost.",

I think it connected one time for me. I Purposly got this for the sole purpose of the wifi and it sucks. The only reasons why i wouldnt return it is simply becasue I have already installed the cam and set the wiring and dont want to deal with the traffic and hassle to take it back",

I got 2 units with the same problem. I think it needs a firmware update.Other than this , it is a very good unit for the price for both front and rear cam.Latest update:After serval communications with customer service , right now I can view the cam files on my PC. They are going to update the user manual. In order to hook up to the PC , the cam needs to be set on charging mode instead of the mass storage mode as mentioned on the manual.",

I haven't tested out picture or video quality via SD card yet so will have to come back with an update. Video quality while playing back from the camera appears to be good quality. (I still need to test out night time video quality).Like many others have said about this dash cam, it is very good value for the price point. (Clock setting is 24 hour format only which I didn't like but not a deal breaker).Very fast responses by their customer service. I did inquire with the seller about a hardwire kit, which they offered to send out and arrived in about 10 days.",
