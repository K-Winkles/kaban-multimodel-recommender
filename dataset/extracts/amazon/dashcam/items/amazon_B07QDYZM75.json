It was quickly replaced by Amazon customer service. I used the parts to repair the broken one and kept the replacement as a backup. So far so good. The camera looks inside and outside and records everything! Even though it's in color, it seems like most clothing is purple. I got it because I heard about other people who had accidents and it was a your word against mine situation. Never expected I would have to rely on it until someone ran a red light and Tboned my brand new car! In my city, unless you're bleeding or dieing the police don't respond to m.v. accidents. You have to go to the precinct and file a police report. I did not realize how much this little camera captures! \ud83d\ude33 the incident was easy to find and download, but beware that if you are using Google drive to send it to your insurance company you have to turn permissions on or they can't open it. Anyway, the video clip clearly shows my light was a steady green despite what the other party says. I'm very happy! If you don't hard wire it to the battery, make sure you don't drive off without activating it. Could save you alot of aggravation and money!",

                "reviewText": "Bought one a few days ago. I like it so I just ordered another one. Here are the reviews so far :Pros :- very easy to use, plugs into the cigarette ligther socket, works fine recording when car is started and stopped- suction cup is extremely secure and steady once you mount it on the windshield. I did not use that \"static shield\" or some plastic film thingy that they included. I don't know what is that thing for ?- Easy button navigation through menu items- video quality is very good. For reference, a 1-min video at 1080p 30 frame rate(\"FHD P30\") is about 74Mb. I compared 720P(\"HD P30\") and realized there's not much difference in video quality but file size is smaller at 50Mb. I could still make out license plates at 720P so I changed mine to 720P(\"HD P30\") setting- night infrared inside cabin is excellent- rear cam can see the entire cabin, all passengers, and all side windows and rear windowCons : (See photos)- power cord is in the way and gets recorded in the rear cam. I had to bend it really far back to prevent it from being in the rear video footage. The power cord orientation should have the cord at the bottom instead of the top - support team please take note of this design flaw- at night driving you cannot make out any license plates. See the photo showing me at a complete stop and the license plate is just a blur.I did not test any app, wifi, parking, or any other advance functions so I don't know how well those work. Partly because I don't need those, I just need a basic dashcam that records. I hope this review helps others in the decision-making process !",

                "reviewText": "Product looks very Sturdy. And high in quality. Gonna try it out the upcoming weeks/months and we we will see how it holds up.Update: I like the fact that this dash camera doesn\u2019t have a battery In it. All the other dash cams I had in the past came with internal batteries and when the battery went bad the camera stopped functioning properly. And they don\u2019t make it easy to replace the battery.Update 2: week and a half of use.I\u2019ve been using the dash camera for about a week and a half (about 70 hours) so far. It\u2019s worked great. I haven\u2019t had any major issues. There was once when I unplugged the hardwire kit from the mini usb from the dash cam and the camera reset to original settings. Out of 3 times I\u2019ve unplugged it it happened once. I noticed when the screensaver didn\u2019t come on and the camera stayed on without turning off the screen. I I\u2019ve also noticed that when the parking mode activates when I get in the car. And I turn on the car it has trouble turning on the infrared night mode when it\u2019s night time. So I gotta turn on the car quickly before parking mode comes on. Another issue I had today was the camera started freezing as it was recording today it would get to about 1:36 and freeze and stop recording. I think this was caused by me taking out the sd card from the camera. I find it easier to view the videos from my iphone lightning cable to micro sd card reader. No matter what the camera wouldn\u2019t work properly. I tried a bunch of things like formatting sd card and nothing. What fixed the issue is disconnecting it from the power completely by disconnecting mini usb from cam and it fixed the problem. It\u2019s working like the first day I got it again.If you plan on getting this cam make sure you remove the power from it every now and then so it can reboot properly. Even personal computers, androids, and iPhones should be shut off and rebooted every now and then so they can work properly. Sometimes they slow down from being on to long.Update 3. Had to take away a \u2b50\ufe0f. I\u2019ve been using this camera for a little over a month and it\u2019s gone threw about 3 sd cards. Samsung Evo 256GbScandisk ultra 128gbScandisk extreme 256gb.In my previous different old camera I had a Scandisk ultra 128gb and it lasted more then 2 years with 50-60 hours of continuous recording weekly.In this camera the sd cards work fine in the beginning but after about a week or so of use it starts freezing which means the sd card starts failing. Cause as soon as I put in a new sd card it works as it should. I\u2019ve also emailed support about the issue I\u2019m having and they stopped responding. They were responding so well before but as soon as the 30 day return window closed on Amazon they stopped responding. Maybe it\u2019s a coincidence. Or maybe not.Im trying one more sd card. \u201cSamsung pro endurance 256gb\u201d. If this one fails as well I\u2019m gonna give this camera 2 stars. And look into buying another dash cam.I bought my girlfriend a different front and rear dash cam and the first sd card I put in it 128gb worked good and never freezes with no problem.It seems like this camera is picky with the SD cards. I\u2019ll keep you guys posted on how this Samsung Endurance pro 256gb sd card turns out.",

Customer support says to factory reset and format the SD card, I did and the camera would seem to work well for temporarily, but then would start acting up again. My Pruveeo F5 installed in my other car has been super reliable, so this brand knows how to build dash cams...or used to...this unreliable D30H is my second and last Pruveeo.",
