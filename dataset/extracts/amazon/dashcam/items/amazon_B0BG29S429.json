Holding it down for 10 secs turned the camera off, but it turned itself back on immediately.I wasted almost an hour pressing buttons, holding buttons for many many seconds, etc...etc...etc.I finally realized I was wasting my time.

                "reviewText": "This has been running a LOT since I got it. Every time I get in the car, both cameras are rolling. The picture quality is good to go, the sound is crystal clear, and it was a breeze to get set up and installed. It came with a 32GB SD card, so I didn't have to provide my own, which I appreciated. You can just leave this on loop recording, and unless you have something noteworthy happen, it will record over the oldest footage once it gets full. If you have something happen that you want to save, just pop the card into a computer or phone or something and save it. Very easy. I especially like the picture in picture mode.",
