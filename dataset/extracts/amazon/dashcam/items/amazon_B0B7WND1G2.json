A: The cellular data will cause the live feed not to be viewed. Please disable the \"Peztio\" cellular data of your cellphone. Setting\u2192Peztio\u2192Disable the \"Cellular Data\". 2. Q: Can't connect WiFi or connect failed? A: Please remember to authorize the App with the album, location, WLAN & cellulardata and turn off the VPN, security software and anti-virus APP of your mobile phone, otherwise you will not be able to connect to wifi. 3. Q: Why doesn't WiFi connected automatically? A: Let me explain to you why we set the wifi to need to be connected manually instead of automatically connect the wifi as soon as it is turned on. Since many mobile phones on the market are single-channel mobile phones, the SIM card cannot be used after connecting to WiFi. We are worried that the automatic opening and connection of WiFi will cause some mobile phones to be unable to use 4/5G and miss important information. 4. Q: How to activate this dash cam's parking monitoring function? A: Q3 support 24 hours recording only when it is connected to a mini USB hardwire kit (not included in the package), please search B0BFFGCMDZ and connect the hardwire kit to you fuse box.",

The video is good the sound is good and it has all of the basic functionality you'd expect. Where this camera really shines compared to other cams I've had though, is in the instructions, customer service and app. The instruction manual is thorough, has large print and is written in clean, proper english. The app is the same; very intuitive, simple and not jankey at all (unlike most of the other camera apps I've used). Customer service reached out immediately after I bought the cam and gave me contact information in case I needed any help setting it up. That really went a long way with me. All in all, I think this a very solid dash cam, and the customer support is excellent. I don't think you can go wrong with this one.",

Once it's connected, it performs faultlessly. The night vision works well and even in dark unlighted roadways your headlights provide a decent video. Additionally the customer support is second to none. I have a RAV4 and realized the adapter plug provided took more space than I was willing to give up. A quick email and within days I was provided a USB adapter cord which solved my problem. I would not hesitate to recommend this company for any product.",

As long as you spend time reading the provided manual booklet (which takes about 5-10 minutes to read) or at least skim through it, then setting up and using the product is easy.Pros:- Great price (based on the other dash cams available on Amazon)- Quick and responsive customer support; even provided a follow up email checking on whether I got my requested USB cable replacement (which was free!)- Easy to set up- Camera provides decent film qualityCons:- Doesn't come with required chip (have to buy it individually from elsewhere on Amazon, etc.)- Doesn't come with USB cable (have to ask customer support)- NOT WIRELESS (cord can be a hassle if you're not willing to decorate the cord around the inside of your car)Besides the cons, some other minor areas for improvement would be adding more of those wiring clips for the dashcam wire and providing substitute tape for the clips. I found 5 clips to not be enough for me to hold the wire around the inside of my car and when I had to peel off the clips to move them around, the tape ripped, so I'm planning to place adhesive tape over them to get the clips to stick again. Nevertheless, these cons/areas of improvement are not a major burden to me.But again, great product and would recommend buying this product if you're looking to just have a dash cam for your car.",

This one sits behind the rear view mirror and is completely out of sight. However, this cam also has a small information screen, which is great because it just shows instant info at a glance: recording status, audio status, wifi status, card status and the clock. You can set a setting to turn the screen off after a timeout. The quality of the video is very good day and night. You can clearly see all the details, no shaking. Downloaded videos (which you download by connecting with your phone to the camera's wifi) are saved in your album and are playable/shareable right away. Very happy so far!",

I wanted to take a moment to share my experience with the 'Arifayz' Dashcam that I recently installed in my car.I am thoroughly impressed with this product and felt compelled to give it a well-deserved 5-star rating! First off, the video recording quality is great with a clear 1080p resolution. The installation process was a breeze, thanks to the easy-to-follow instructions and the included glue clippers, which help in neatly hiding the wiring. I also appreciate the thoughtful inclusion of a transparent sticker to prevent any glue damage to the glass when mounting the camera. The customer support provided is excellent, with helpful video tutorials that guide you through the installation process. The accompanying application is a fantastic feature, allowing you to control various settings such as recording length, video resolution, and even download videos and photos directly from the device. Moreover, the dashcam comes with a 24-hour parking mode system, night vision, and G-sensors, all of which add to the sense of security and functionality of the product.Overall, I'm extremely happy with the 'Arifayz' Dashcam and would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a reliable car dashcam.",
