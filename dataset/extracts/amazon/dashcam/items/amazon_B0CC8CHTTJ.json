                "media_text": "FQA FOR WANLIPO DASH CAM WITH WIFI Q: Do I need to download a dedicated app? If needed, how can I download the app? A: At present, this 4K dashboard camera can be connected to WIFI to operate in the app, or not connected to wifi, and you can playback the recorded video on the wifi dashboard camera under the condition of ensuring that the wireless dashboard camera is recording (the blue indicator flashes once per second to indicate that it is recording). But if you don't like connecting to wifi and managing front dashboard camera through the app, we sincerely suggest that you do not turn on wifi, and suggest that you playback on the dashcam if you need to. If you want to manage wireless dash cam through an app, please download the Viidure app. Here are the methods to download the app: Method 1: Search and download viidure in the App Store or Google play. Method 2: Scan the QR code of the menu in the dashcam to download the viidure App. Method 3: Scan the QR code of the user manual to download the viidure App. Q: Do I have to connect to the Viidure App via wifi using this wireless dash camera for cars? Is it possible to connect via bluetooth? A: Yes, this 4K car dash camera 2160P only connects to the Viidure App through WiFi, please note that there is absolutely no Bluetooth connection. Please refer to the following steps to connect WiFi: Firstly, turn on the 4K dashcam, press the \u201cOK\u201d to stop recording, and long press the \"Up\" until the WiFi icon appears on the wifi car dash camera screen. Secondly, the WiFi account and password will be displayed in the lower left corner of the screen. Thirdly, turn on the mobile phone WiFi, find the WiFi account corresponding to the 4K vehicle dash camera, and enter the initial password 12345678. Fourthly, when the mobile phone is connected to the WiFi, if the WiFi logo of the wifi car camera dash cam is green, the connection to WiFi is successful. Finally, open the viidure app and click the \"Access Camera\" to synchronize the video of the 4K car dashcam.",

                "media_text": "FQA FOR WANLIPO DASH CAM WITH WIFI Q: How to playback the video of 4K dash cam\uff1f A: Method 1: When the wifi dash cam stops recording (press the OK key to stop recording), press the \"M\" to select the video file and press the OK key to playback the video. Method 2: After the mobile phone is connected to the wifi of the front dash cam, view the real-time recorded video on the app. Method 3: Put the dash cam's memory card into the memory card reader, and then connect the card reader to a personal computer to view the video. Q: Why does this 4K dashcam suddenly turn on when the car engine is turned off and the doors are opened/closed? A: This is because you have activated the parking mode. When the car is turned off and in the parking state, the vibration of opening/closing the car door is recognized as a car collision. This will turn on and record emergency videos before turning off. If you really don't like this, we suggest that you turn off the parking mode. However, please note that if parking mode is turned off, once your car is hit during parking, it will not start up to retain important evidence. Q: Why do I have to reconnect to WiFi every time I open this WiFi dashcam? Is there any way to solve this problem? A: Because for Android phones, constantly connecting to WiFi may prevent you from using cellular data to access the internet and receive messages, the default setting is to open this 4K dash camera every time. If you need to connect to WiFi, you need to reconnect. In fact, you don't need to connect to WiFi all the time because playing the video can also be on the front dashcam under the condition of ensuring that the 4K dash camera for cars is recording. The blue indicator flashes once per second to indicate recording. If you don't want to reconnect to WiFi every time you turn on the front dash camera for cars, please support us to obtain a special software upgrade file to solve it. Q:Does this 4K car camera require the purchase of additional hardware? A: No, absolutely not. This wifi car camera does not require the purchase of additional hardware kits to support parking mode. In fact, this front car camera comes with parking mode (default off). If you want to turn on parking mode, you need to click the menu when the 4K dashcam for cars is stopped recording and go to the settings to find [Parking Mode] to turn it on. Some friends may have been prompted by the app's settings to purchase additional hardware for parking mode, but in reality, it is not necessary. We will fix this error in the app in the near future.",

Please carefully read the product description on Amazon's website when purchasing. Q: Is the car ignition powered? A: Yes, the build in low battery of the front dashcam for cars is only used for emergency video recording, there is not enough power to record the car charger worn in the packaging must be used to connect the interface to the car designation for normal recording. Q: Do I have to connect to WiFi to use and operate this 4K dash camera? A:No, absolutely not, this wifi dash camera can connect to the app via wifi to play back videos and manage settings. When the front dash camera is in normal recording state, the blue indicator flashes once per second to indicate that it is recording. You can play back the video directly on the 4K car dash cam, or insert the memory card of the wifi car dash cam into the card reader and then connect it to a PC to play back the video. Q: Does the package include only the 4K camera for car? Does the wifi camera for car with wifi have an inside camera and a rear camera? A:Yes, currently this 4K dashcam for cars only comes with a front dashcam for cars. Please be particularly careful not to include the inside camera and rear camera. Please carefully read the packaging description of this 4K car on-dash mounted cameras on Amazon's website when purchasing. Q: Why is the suction cup mount not sticky? How can I install and fix it to the windshield? A: This suction cup mount itself is not sticky and is mainly stuck to the windshield by turning the [twist knob] of the suction cup mount to \"lock\". If you still do not understand how to install the suction cup mount, please refer to the manual . Q: If the car is turned off, will this 4K car cam still work? A: Due to the connection between the wifi car cam and the car ignition device through a car charger, once the car is turned off, the front car cam will also immediately shut down and cannot continue to work.",

                "reviewText": "This dash camera really surprised me with how nice it is. It was really easy to install and hide the wire. It came with plenty of cable length. It has 24 hours recording capabilities. The camera itself is very sensitive. That's my only issue, as it seems to record when someone slams the car door too hard or even the lift gate. But honestly, the more I think about it, that should be a good thing. I want a camera that's going to pick up someone messing with my car. The app is fairly easy to use as well. The camera even included a micro SD card so store any accidents that may happen. The picture and video is pretty decent. Better than expected. Currently, the price for this unit is $59 and some change, but at the time of this review there is a 50% off coupon and I don't think you can beat 30 bucks for a nice dash camera. It's a fantastic buy.",

I have a Rove 4K for my primary vehicle, but didn't want to spend as much for my classic car which gets driven very little. But, having had it damaged in a collision recently, I wanted a 4K recording capability. The WANLIPO caught my attention because of its 4K capabilities and its price; PLUS it included a 64gig memory ship (Rove doesn't). The dashcam itself doesn't have the same quality look & feel as the Rove, and the image produced doesn't include much of the Rove's meta data (GPS location, Speed, etc). However, once I made it thru the somewhat difficult-to-read Chinlish instruction manual and tried it out, I found it was great for what I intended. And the video image quality was as good as, or better than that of the Rove.",
