                "reviewText": "To look at, you wouldn't think this dash cam was able to produce the fine images and videos it does, - I am really impressed with the end results.The 170\u00ba wide-angle videos are crystal clear with good color balance. Being such a wide angle, I was surprised there wasn't more edge distortion.I installed the front camera on the passenger side of the windshield. Must change that to a more central location as the lens captures too much of the right window trim. It would be better placed beside or directly under the rear-view mirror.Getting the power cable from the power supply to the camera was fairly easy, but getting the cable to the rear camera was more difficult.I had plenty of cable length to play with, but hiding it was not easy.I had my rear camera installed on the rear window using a spare suction cup.This idea didn't last long as the rear defogger grid prevented a long-lasting suction seal. Changed that to the supplied adhesive pad.The manual describes how to install the rear camera by the rear license plate.... This was confusing to me as there was no specs on the camera to say it was weather proof. Plus it indicated I had to drill a hole through the car's body?!... And why would I have to connect the red cable to the car's reversing light?The instructions were pretty skimpy in this regard.The set up buttons on the main camera were easy to understand and operate. My preferred method to set up the camera is through the Viidure app using a wifi connection \u2013 which works well.For now I am not using the parking monitor or motion detection features. But I suppose I could without ordering their additional hardware kit, as my 'cigarette lighter' power supply does not shut down when the ignition is turned off.As mentioned, the quality of videos and jpegs that are saved to the SD card are exceptional.However, the video's format, .ts (MPEG-2 Transport Stream) will not play directly on my Mac without additional software.. I use VLC Media player. Also if I want to edit a saved video, my Mac's video editing app does not recognize the file format either.Recording time varies depending on video quality chosen, but you should get at least 6 or 7 hours of recording time (using both cameras) before old files are over-written by new.That's using the supplied 64GIG sd card. Upgrading to a 128GIG card will double the recording time.All things considered , this complete dash-cam set is a good deal.It comes with everything you need to continuously record your travels, both front and rear, in high-quality videos. It's versatile features are easy to operate and is unobtrusive .Even with my file format issues, I would definitely recommend this dash-cam set from KUSSLA.",

                "reviewText": "This dash-cam was meant to be a replacement for my SUV. Overall it was fairly simple to install, and really doesn't require the rear camera to be installed for it function well. The iPhone application for use with the camera, actually had step by step instructions for adding a new camera to your profile, and unlike other cameras like Nexar, did not require me to create an account or have an email address. My only problem with the camera is the connectivity of the wifi. When those \"egg-heads\" Kussla co-opted the app, I don't think they added provisions for background usage. Basically once you connect to the camera's network, using your iPhone cellular data services is next to impossible, and almost always produces an on-screen prompt to either continue with wifi or use cellular data. In other words, your iPhone will think the dashcam is actually some kind of modem or wireless gateway, that has no connectivity to the web",

                "reviewText": "Pros:The picture quality is a bit better than bargain cameras. License plates still need to be within 10-15ft to read. (The box it came in says 1080, but the camera has a 2.5k setting and the video is indeed 2.5k)When you put the car in reverse it automatically switches to the rear camera with parking guidelines.Included 64GB card is a real 64GB card (60GB usable).Multiple mounting options included.Cons:Buttons on sides require you to remember where the different buttons are and what their function is.Parking mode requires installation of a hard wired kit per instructions, but all it needs is constant power. If your power outlet stays on when the car is off it will work. All parking mode does is continue loop recording and lock the video segment (so it isn't overwritten) if an impact is detected.Parking mode must be manually turned on and must be manually turned off before returning to normal driving mode, otherwise video from driving will be locked and fill the card with locked videos.Battery is only large enough to power the camera for 5-10 minutes. If your car battery is damaged in an accident, the camera will only run another 5-10 minutes after it lost power.Overall the picture quality is better than the cheapest dashcams, but the small battery and poor onboard interface make it hard to use its full potential. Perhaps the wifi interface is more intuitive, but I did not want to install an app or follow a QR code. If you need a backup camera and good quality front video to record in a loop and aren't worried about parking mode, this camera might work for you.",

                "reviewText": "I received it well packaged and it contained all of the parts needed. Installation was pretty simple, just stick the camera mount to the window, attached the camera, plug in the 12 volt cord and finally (the hardest part) mount the the backup camera and run the cord all the way to the windshield. I installed the backup camera on the weekend (the front facing camera can work just fine without it). Operation is pretty simple: when you plug it in it starts recording, when you start the car it starts recording, when you turn off the ignition it stops recording after a few minutes. The only thing I didn't like about the camera is that in order for the camera to record if someone bumps your car you have to buy a different wiring harness \"sold separately.\" The problem is that I couldn't find the wiring harness so it's only going to record when you're driving. For me that's not a deal-breaker but I'd rather pay an extra dollar or 2 and get everything I need instead something that is questionably available for an additional fee. It is a nice camera otherwise, the video is easy to download and it appears to be durable and well made.",
