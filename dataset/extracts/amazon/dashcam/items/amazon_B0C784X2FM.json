For 4K dash cam, 2.4G wifi could not meet requirements, the transmission speed of 5G is about 2-4 times that of 2.4G, up to 10MB/s What is the difference between H.265 and H.264? The main difference is that HEVC (H.265) allows for further reduced file size. H.264 (AVC) can be chosen for compatibility with older desktop and mobile devices. We recommend VLC Media Player on PC to play videos. How to use parking monitoring function? Do I have to buy a separate hardwire kit? Yes, parking monitoring function require the hardwire kit and protect the car battery from depleting. Hardwire kit is not included, you need to buy it separately (Asin: B0BNPWTSBH). Is normal for my dash cam to get hot? OMBAR 572 allow withstand extreme temperatures from -4\u00b0F to 158\u00b0F(-20\u00b0-70\u00b0), the normal working temperature is about 30\u2103 to 50\u2103, so it is normal for your dash camera to run slightly hot, especially in 4K recording. What should I pay attention to when using it for the first time? Pls tear off all protective film before using the dash cam for the first time. You MUST formate the SD card before the first-time use. Pls ALWAYS connect with power when using as it is built in Super Capacitor(without battery).",

Installation was tedious as expected for any front & rear dash cam, but I was pleased to see the product came with a tool which made it much easier to tuck in and hide wires. Easy to install. Small and unobtrusive - not an issue at all after installing it on the windshield below my mirror. Immediately connects to my phone every time I start my car. Creates great videos and easy to download a video directly to my phone if needed. Will recommend to anyone who looking for a new dash cam.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I shopped around for dash cams and then finally landed on this one and I couldn't be more impressed with its performance. I can finally go on daily commute with a sense of security. The packaging was quite an overkill giving a quiet premium feel which is justified with the price. Installation was easy, just peel off the plastic and the stick to the windshield (Honda Civic 2015). I forgot to clean off the windshield before sticking it on but it seems sturdy enough to last a long time. The included car charger was quite long and meant to be tucked into the rubber panels of the door and the windshield, but I didn't do it because of the hassle. The dangling power line doesn't bother me anyway. The recorded video was quite crispy and good clarity. At highest resolution, a 1 hour commute takes about 10 GB storage. With a 128G micro SD card, it's enough to record 5 days of commute for me, which is more than sufficient. The angle is wide enough to capture everything I can see through the windshield. The night vision is clear enough to record all the license plates of cars around me, a peace of mind for night driving. I haven't tested Wi-Fi connection yet, but I can see why it may come handy when needed. The unit is in black so it can be warm to the touch under California sun, but it's not affecting the performance or caused any issue. Playing back on the LCD on highest resolution can lag a frame every few seconds, not easy to notice, but once you do it becomes more obvious. Not a deal breaker as mostly the videos are being viewed on a computer or cell phone. Overall, it's being a good investment. For a dash cam you'd want something of good quality and reliability instead of some cheap crap under $50.",

Rear camera took longer (just over an hour), again routing the cable uner the trims. Set up is very easy. Connection to device wifi is stable. Once connected the phone app is quite easy to navigate through. Videos and photos can easily be downloaded from the app. Wifi needs to be turned on in the camera setting each time the camera is turned on, which is a little tedious but it works. Working with the buttons on the camera is a little clunky. Once you get used to it then it's ok also. Video quality, day or night, is exceptional on both cameras. I find the magnetic connector very useful to take the camera off or put it back on a again. Very happy so far! Will report back should anything go wrong in the coming days/weeks.",
