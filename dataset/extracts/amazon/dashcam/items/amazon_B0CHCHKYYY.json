The provided power cable has more than enough length to hide it through your interior panels and if you turn the voice off, you can get in, drive off, and know that your drive is being recorded without even thinking about it. That's the *only* thing I do not like about this unit.. . . the annoying voice prompts, but as previously stated, you can turn it off in the settings.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Simple and Reliable Performance",
                "reviewText": "The AQV Dash Cam offers protection in the form of visual evidence in a simple, and basic form. Basically, if it is attached to your cars power via the supplied cigarette lighter adaptor, it turns on and starts recording when you start your car. And really, that is as difficult as it needs to be. It will record in 1-minute loops, automatically erasing the oldest of them when the inserted SD is full. That\u2019s all the features you need, in my opinion. Thus far, it has performed that task reliably.The camera has one resolution, 1080FHD at 30fps, that is plenty if you\u2019re not trying to view license plates that were 100 yards away. Image quality with whatever the lens/sensor combination may be is pretty decent, enhanced as it is with WDR.The AQV does have an associated app that can be downloaded, one that fortunately does not require creating an account and password. If you\u2019d like to see what the camera is seeing or change settings, you connect the app to the camera via your phones Wi-Fi setting. I found the connection to take place without much fuss, another attribute of the AQV I appreciated. Once in the settings menu there are a number of settings, although I found the defaults to be just fine. If you find that the AQV starts recording emergency videos when there isn\u2019t an emergency, then the G-Sensor setting can be adjusted to less sensitivity. So far, this has not been a problem. Curiously, there is a setting for \u201cVoice Prompt,\u201d but there is no mention of a voice prompt capability in the little multi-language booklet that is provided as a user manual. Thus far, the AQV has remained mute to any of my inquiries, even when being my most polite. In fact, the AQV has a very limited vocabulary, spoken with a female voice using the English language with Chinese syntax. My kind of girl.The AQV Dash Cam is supplied with everything noted by the seller on the point of purchase page. You stick it on your windshield, run the wiring under the car\u2019s interior molding with the supplied hooked tool, and plug it in. Start your car and it starts recording, turn off your car and it stops. There is a button on the side that allows the user to start and stop recording. Along with video recording it records a sound track. You can tell it not to do this in the settings menu. If you are involved in an impact, the Dash Cam will automatically start recording an \u201cEmergency Video.\u201d There is no reference to what that is in the manual, but I am assuming it is distinguished by the fact that it won\u2019t be automatically erased; but without further inquiry, I don\u2019t know that for a fact. But I\u2019m not going to inquire farther.Apparently, as asseverated by the seller, you can \u201cEnjoy live streaming, download videos, tweak settings, edit footage, and effortlessly share your captures with friends and family on social media.\u201d Is that safe?I appreciate the simplicity of this device, and for my part, have it installed for no other reasons than to record anything that might impact my automobile or anything I might hit. Of course, we all hope neither of those things should come to pass.",

                "reviewText": "Right out of the packaging, this camera feels different. Constructed with a metal housing (vs plastic), it feels solid. Its many impressive features are too numerous to list, but the important thing to mention is the beautifully clear, high-definition picture this camera captures.I wish I had this dash cam installed when a hit-and-run driver rear-ended my new car recently. It might have caught his license plate as he sped off. This incident was my motivation in ordering this dash cam. This camera records on a continuous loop. From the camera\u2019s menu, I chose the 5-minute loop. After recording video for five minutes, the camera records the next five minute video over the previous. If there is an image worth saving, simply push a button on the side and that video will be preserved. Easy! It also has a built-in sensor to detect the impact of a collision. In this case, the camera automatically preserves the video.Like I mentioned earlier, the camera has too many features to list in this review, but this also touches on the one weakness of this camera\u2026the manual. It\u2019s not well-written and fails to explain some of the camera\u2019s options. This wasn\u2019t a big issue. I scrolled through the camera\u2019s various menus and figured most of it out quickly. I relied on the internet to answer a few questions on features and settings the manual didn\u2019t cover well.Overall, it\u2019s a great camera at a good price. It provides a little peace-of-mind while out on the increasingly chaotic roads.",
