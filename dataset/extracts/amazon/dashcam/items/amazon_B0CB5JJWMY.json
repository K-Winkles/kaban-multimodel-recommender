Yes, you need to purchase a hardware kit connected to enable 24/7 parking monitoring. After the engine is turned off, 24 hours of video is automatically captured. (Note: Hardware kit must be purchased separately) How many times can the driving recorder be used normally in hot and cold weather? It uses supercapacitors, which are more heat-resistant and do not pose a danger of overheating or exploding. The operating temperature of the recorder is -4\u00b0F and 155\u00b0F, at which the recorder can work normally. Can the rear camera be mounted on a vertical window? There are two installation methods. The first is installed on the inside of the rear window of the car, and the second can be installed on the vertical external glass with waterproof function. Can someone tell me if all three cameras work at the same time? How does the rear camera record? Yes, this dashcam works on three screens at once. If you don't install a rear camera, it will only record two front and interior views. Why do I always have to format the memory card with the dashcam? Buying the Azacvb dashcam comes with a 32GB memory card that asks you to format the locked video when it's full. The recording time can be increased 16 times to ensure the integrity of the video.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The installation of the front camera is fast and easy, but the rear-one requires a little more workI liked the fact that they included a 32GB SD card compatible with the recording high-speed (saved me time and $)The camera is quite small, yet wide-angle but does not get obstructed by the mirror or the windshield frit pattern (see picture) Note that only the from camera its recorded in memory, the 2 other ones are not. The daytime recording is fair (attached snapshot) but the quality of \u201cin-built super-night vision\u201d is slightly deceiving (see video). Overall it\u2019s a good purchase and I hope it will last several years of un-interrupted recording",

                "reviewText": "A rear end hit and run prompted my first thought of a dash cam. A year later research led me to this one, the Azacvb unit. All I neee was:- simple setup and use- a clear display- front, interior, and rear views- a reasonable priceSo far, so good on all points. Setting up the main unit took maybe 15 minutes to hide the wiring. I used a blunt bike tire replacement took to push the wire between the trim but could easily have just used my fingers. Clearly marked buttons on the bottom of the unit made choosing which views to display easy. Changing that view is equally simple - just toggle back and forth. Keeping the cam plugged into the car's 12v port means it turns on and off with your engine.It comes with own sd card so you don't have to know which type or capacity to buy separately. Basically this unit is plug and play. Simple.I only connected the rear camera this morning after using the cam flawlessly for 2 1/2 weeks with the front and interior views. The displays are a bit over exposed with the sky blown out on very bright days. But it isn't extreme and license plates etc., are clearly visible, so not a deal breaker.Caution, most newer vehicles have a sensor box behind the rear view mirror. I attached my cam too close to it so it blocks a small amount of the peripheral view to camera left (see photo). A second double sided tape came with the unit so I can reposition it when I'm ready - it hasn't posed a problem yet.The rear view looks good. If issues come up I'll update this review.Disclosure: 2 weeks after my purchase the seller requested a review and provided an incentive. I'd already formed a positive opinion and am glad to share it above.",

                "reviewText": "This 4K Dashcam is a great value for additional driving assurance. The price is reasonable, and it comes with both a front-facing and rear camera, as well as a 32 GB SD card. The front-facing camera also has an vehicle interior camera as well. The camera adhesive is pretty sturdy on the windshield. The camera has pretty good picture quality for the price. Camera installation difficulty is relative to each vehicle, but be sure to hide the wires as much as possible. Users need to format the SD card prior to using the camera. The instructions are minimal, so be sure to watch a few Youtube videos prior to installation. The menu selection for the camera is cumbersome, however.",

                "reviewText": "If you're buying a dash cam, its probably because you want the piece of mind that if anything happens, you have adequate evidence of the incident. This camera very easily records a front view, and an interior cabin view. With provided cables and some handyman skills, you can also fairly easily record a rear view as well. It comes with everything you need (even an SD card) and set up is very simpleThe front view camera's field of view is lacking (when positioned directly in the center, you can see most of the window's view out with some edges cut)The interior cabin camera's field of view is incredibly small. I can only see the passenger seat and nothing else. Would really like a wider field for this. (granted, I drive a small hatchback, and the camera ends up quite close to the persons face)The rear view camera is solid, not movie quality by any means but does the job.At the end of the day, if you are buying this purely to have a backup recording in case of an accident, its great.",
