                "reviewText": "I have three cars and I've gotten two generic A119 cameras and never had any problems. They don't have a lot of bells and whistles, like an app that can connect to the camera and view/download the videos, but they've dependably recorded without issues. I got the Garmin for my Porsche, I wanted to be able to view videos on my phone rather than having to take an SD card out and view it on a computer. Even though the generic cameras had no issues, I felt the Garmin would be a more reliable option since it was for my more expensive car. Boy was I wrong, the Garmin worked fine for two months and then would intermittently record. The camera comes on, shows the red light indicating its recording and I can even connect to it, but it won't record videos from some 75% of the the drives unless I manually tell it to record (the manual recording is only meant to record short clips). I went to Garmin's site and followed all the directions to fix this issue, this mainly entails formatting the SD card and making sure the camera is plugged in. Nothing has helped. The worst part of this is that the entire time I thought I was protected in the event there was an accident and here this camera was not doing anything. I am just glad I discovered the issue before something happened. I'm going to go back to the old dependable A119s, the Garmin is garbage.",

I have looked high and low for a suitable cam, but all the ones I found seemed to be big and clunky, and I was worried about someone breaking in to my truck just to steal the dash cam. The Garmin Mini Dash cam2 was the perfect size and had all the features I wanted. To start with, this cam is very small and when mounted, you have to really look to see it. It takes outstanding video in Hi-Def, and I paired it with a 128GB Micro SDXC card, so I know I have plenty of space to record. I also installed a Dongar direct connect adaptor, so I plug the power in to the power outlet of my rear-view mirror (yes, I didn't know that was there either). This means you don't have to have an unsightly power cable or the headaches of trying to tuck the cord around the perimeter of the windshield. There isn't a screen on this cam since it is so small, but you can easily pair your Mini Cam2 with your phone via the Garmin app. The video will stun you with the definition and quality of the video.",

                "reviewText": "Overall a good dash cam, but I wish there was another way to view the footage on your phone other than connecting it to your phone with bluetooth while using wifi. The only way I can see the footage is if I'm sitting in my car close enough to the house where I can use the wifi from inside. But overall it has been good at capturing those moments when I have to brake harder than usual, and I like that it's small and inconspicuous and doesn't block my view. The video quality is good enough for my needs.",

I\u2019ve used Garmin products for years and can say that this is just as simple to use and as reliable as I can expect from Garmin. Installation was a breeze as well! Definitely look into the OBD adapter as well.I love it and highly recommend it.",

The red record light is a bit intense in your face when driving at night, but I just put some black sharpie over top of it to dim it. I didn't find the adhiesve to be very good so I replaced it with 2 way Gorilla tape, now it's rock solid.",
