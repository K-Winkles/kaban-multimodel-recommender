If you need to find an ignition switched fuse, put the key in the vehicle, find the fuse which is not lit up while the car is off, and test it by turning the car on to see if it lights up. If your kit requires constant power, turn off the car and remove the key to see which fuse slots stays lit on. Connect the Red Wire Once you've determined which fuse slots you need to use for your hardwiring kit you can crimp the red wire of your hardwire kit onto the Add-A-Fuse. Gently remove the fuse you identified. Install the fuse you just removed into the installation kit add-a-fuse circuit. Plug the add-a-circuit into the fuse box in the correct orientation. Ground the Hardwiring Kit Slip the black wire (which is in the shape of a C) under a metal bolt or screw in your vehicle (this is the ground wire). Check that it is not attached onto plastic parts. You will typically need a socket wrench to loosen the nut or bolt that you choose to ground with. To attach the grounding terminal, loosen the nut or bolt enough to slip it in and tighten it back up afterwards. DUAL SLOT FUSE HOLDER It provides one fuse holder to protect original circuit and provides a lead with the second fuse holder for new circuit.",

After opening the bag I noticed the ground lug was bent and it made me think that this was a returned item. I then started to install the unit taking my time to make sure it will look like a professional install. After several checks and rechecks, I found the 12 to 5 volt transformer was faulty. I had to cut the low side cable in order to check the transformer but that was the reason I did not have voltage on the low side (5V). I have reordered the same unit and I will be returning the faulty one. You would think that if it was a return item, they would test it before shipping it out again.",

This product is suppose to be wired live so that if motion detection would go off it would start recording. What it did do was kill my battery. Checked my battery with digital battery tester we use at work that does print outs. Battery tested good and it should since it's only 8 months old. Not impressed at all with this product. I did move the power source to a different fuse just to try other options buy again... no crank no start the next morning. Would not recomend",
