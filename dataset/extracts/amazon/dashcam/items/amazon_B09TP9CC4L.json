Then the camera started to turn itself off and on intermittently while I was driving. I assumed it was the camera, took it inside to check power and it worked fine inside. Back to the car and it was turning on and off again and then within a couple more weeks, the camera would not turn on at all when hardwired but worked fine inside. The installer came back, checked all wires and found it to be the box part of this wire kit. He said it was fried. So I\u2019m buying a new hardwire kit from another company. Maybe it was just a one off bad piece but I can\u2019t rate it any higher than a 1. I paid around $15 and got about 2 good wks out of it.",

The fuse tap did not go as deep as I'd have liked but it is making a reliable connection so I suppose I don't have anything to worry about.The adapter box for the kit was a little bulky, but it still fit inside the windshield pillar and made for a very nice and nearly invisible dash cam install.",
