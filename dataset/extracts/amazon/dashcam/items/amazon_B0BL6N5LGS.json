Pls short Press 3 times WiFi button in a row to shift to 2.4GHz if your phone can't search DC42 WiFi. How do I get my rear cam to work? It's not showing in the app. Make sure you plug the rear camera in while the main camera is not connected to power. If had this problem, we suggest that disconnect it, unplug the front one from power, the plug the rear one back in and then the front one to power last. What is the difference between H.265 and H.264? The main difference is that HEVC (H.265) allows for further reduced file size. H.264 (AVC) can be chosen for compatibility with older desktop and mobile devices. We recommend VLC Media Player on PC to play videos. How to use parking monitoring function? For using dash cam's parking monitor function, it requires 24h hardwire kit (not included), you can purchase it by searching Asin: B0BL6YMCN9. What should I pay attention to when using it for the first time? Pls tear off the protective film on all camera before using the dash cam for the first time. Before first time use, you MUST formate the SD card. (reverse insertion will result in damage to the card slot.) More Details Pls Refer To the Manual.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently regretted not having a camera installed when I got into an accident. Until now, I\u2019ve always had dash cams installed by professionals at a car shop, so discovering I could do it myself was a revelation. After some research and tutorials on YouTube, I found that installing one is quite straightforward, especially if you manage to hide the wires properly. It was a valuable learning experience. What\u2019s great is that this can be done for under $100 without any installation fees, making it an affordable option for basic needs.To my surprise, despite its budget-friendly price, the dash cam does not look cheap at all and has a premium appearance. It came with a tool for removing car parts, like a pry bar, and included two spare 3M stickers, which means I can easily reuse it if I switch cars. While the camera boasts 4K quality, it\u2019s not exceptionally clear, but it\u2019s more than sufficient for reading license plates of surrounding cars, which is crucial. Initially, I found the startup sound a bit loud, but I was able to easily adjust the settings through its app. The built-in Wi-Fi allows for live viewing on my smartphone, although it can be a bit sluggish. Sometimes, the app crashes when I try to view recorded footage, but unless it\u2019s necessary, it might not be worth the hassle to use. Considering its price, cost-performance ratio, and quality, I highly recommend this product. As someone who is not very knowledgeable about cars, I found the installation process to be straightforward and believe anyone can install it. I plan to buy another one for my husband\u2019s car!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this car dashcam after reading many positive reviews online and I am very happy with my purchase. The dashcam is easy to install and use, and the video quality is excellent. It records both the front and rear views of the road, and has a wide-angle lens that captures everything. The dashcam also has a night vision mode that works well in low-light conditions. The dashcam automatically saves the footage in case of a collision or a sudden brake, and has a loop recording feature that overwrites the oldest files when the memory card is full. The dashcam also has a built-in GPS that records the speed and location of the vehicle, and a Wi-Fi function that allows me to view and download the videos on my smartphone. The only thing I wish is that the cables are longer, as they are a bit short for my car. Other than that, I have no complaints about this dashcam. It is a great device that gives me peace of mind and security on the road. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a reliable and affordable car dash-cam.",
