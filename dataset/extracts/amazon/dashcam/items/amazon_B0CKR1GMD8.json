                "reviewText": "The 3 Channel 4K WiFi Dash Cam really caught my eye with its crystal-clear 4K resolution and the fact that it covers all angles with front, rear, and interior cameras. What's super handy is the WiFi connectivity, making it a breeze to access footage straight from your smartphone. But, I gotta say, it's a bit on the larger side, and you might notice it hanging there. On the bright side, setting it up is a piece of cake, and it's user-friendly all the way.The camera's built tough, and the night vision is pretty impressive. The only hiccup is dealing with those high-res recordings \u2013 they're fantastic, but the file sizes mean you've got to stay on top of memory management. Despite that little snag, it's a powerhouse when it comes to keeping an eye on your ride.",

                "reviewText": "We have a one-year-old baby. When I drive, I cannot see my baby at the back (in his car seat), which makes me worried. This dash cam is of great help, as now I can see the back of my car and other angles freely. The dash cam is of good quality; people, cars, and other surroundings can be seen very clearly in real-time. Switching to different modes is easy. The provided memory is sufficient, so I do not have concerns about storage. I think that it is a great deal, especially for families with little kids.",
