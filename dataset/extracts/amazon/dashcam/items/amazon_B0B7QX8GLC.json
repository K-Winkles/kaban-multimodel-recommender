I bought this dash cam in mid March of 2023, after a few months of using it, the camera no longer retain the settings and randomly restart and constantly goes into screen saver mode. I try adjusting and resetting it back to default but it still not retaining the settings. Since I was past the amazon return period, I contacted the seller and seller was quick to respond with help and troubleshooting. The issue was not resolved so seller offer to send me a new one instead. Definitely worth getting, good camera, mine was just maybe defected some how. Overall this is a great camera for the price. Would definitely recommend it due to seller great customer service and standing by their products.",

                "reviewText": "I installed this about 5 weeks ago and it's working excellent so far. The hardest part of the installation was fussing to get the wires tucked in behind the door panel trim. It comes with a tool, it's just a tedious step. I installed both the front and rear cameras but you can do just the front. There is the option of recording both audio and video. Mine is set to video only - not sure if this saves recording space.To view the footage, I removed the front camera (disconnect the cords and slide it off the stand - no need to remove the camera holder). It comes with a USB cable that connected directly to my computer which had no problem recognizing the files or playing the video clips. It opens with two folders - front camera and rear camera. Each folder has several 3-minute video clips. They're named with the date and time (be sure to set the date and time when you install it so you can find videos later!) I wanted to check out some footage but I drove for an hour afterwards. I was worried it had been overwritten from the loop recording mechanism. But it was there - about midway through the list of available files, nowhere near being overwritten. I didn't make any changes to the USB. If you're worried about how long it will hold on to recordings, I recommend just getting it and testing it out before deciding what to do.By the way - the quality of the videos is great!Cons - I can't properly install my sun visor now because the camera is in the way :/ And the screen on the camera itself is too tiny to be of use. It's good for setting up and making sure it's recording the area you want, then it's better to just let it go black so it's not a distraction anyway.",

                "reviewText": "Camera was easy to install for me. Button functions are not very user friendly when it comes to navigating to what you want to select, but gets easier the more you use it. I do want to point out that this device will NOT hold a charge and has to remain plugged in. Although my car will allow that while not running, I'm sure it cannot be easy on my battery. I like to leave the camera on over night for the motion detection function seeing as though there has been a major uptick in vehicle burglaries around my area. So I am giving 3 stars mainly for that reason because I do recall one of the descriptions, and selling points, was that this device can hold a charge. If my device is defective and this company is willing to replace it, I am more than willing to change my review.All in all this was a good purchase considering the price and the quality of the video/photos. The suction cup is really good as well, hasn't fallen off once",
