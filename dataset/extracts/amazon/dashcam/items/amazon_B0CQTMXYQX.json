                "reviewText": "The install wasn\u2019t too difficult for a diy er like myself. I really appreciate the extra parts that come with this kit like the different types of fuse taps, fuses for the fuse taps, and the other hardware included. If I were to get all this separately, I probably would\u2019ve spend a little more than what I had spent on this kit\u2026 which is why I think this kit was worth it and it works well with my Type S 4K dash cam.",

                "reviewText": "I love that this kit comes with just about everything needed for a DIY installation of a dash cam. Technically it could be everything needed, I just happen to have a plastic rivet tool I also used, but the pry bar included would have worked.It comes with multiple fuse taps, zip ties, pry bar, simple voltage presence probe, etc. It also has built in protection to keep your device from contributing to battery drain.Altogether great kit to grab if you want to go hard wire and want everything to DIY.",
