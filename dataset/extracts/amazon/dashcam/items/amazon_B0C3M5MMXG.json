But I had to buy extension wire for the rear camara because the wire was 2 plus feet shorter.3 days after the installation, the camara stopped working. So when I tested, the power cable got bad, so I had to buy extra power cable. The power cable that I got was almost as twice as thicker than the one that came with the camara.At the end, I could have got a much better camara with the same money that I invested in this one.",
