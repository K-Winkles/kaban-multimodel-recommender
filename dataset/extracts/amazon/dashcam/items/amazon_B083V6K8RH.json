                "reviewText": "I am upgrading from Ventrue N2 Pro dash cam to the new N4 Dash cam.The reason for upgrade is because I was in a 3 car accident, someone rear-ended me, and push my car bump into the car in front of me. When there is no clear evidence to show who caused the accident, 3 car accident can be a messy lawsuit. With camera footage on hand, it is so easy to determined who is at fault and don't have to worry about lawsuit.Because N2 Pro do not have rear camera, I decided to get an upgrade and try the Vantrue N4 Dashcam. I am very impressed with the N4 on the price and video quality. The video quality is wonderful no matter day or night you get the best video compare to other dash cameras. Front Camera is at 2K or 1440P resolution, cabinet and rear cameras are at FHD or 1080P, all at 30 frames per second. and you can purchase the hardwire kit to have it monitor your car 24/7, which is what I did.One can find all the dash camera specs on Amazon page, so here is what I think the pro and con to this dash cameraPRO1. The video quality is impressively good, I am able to get good video from all 3 camera lens in day or night. A clean windshield and rear window also make huge difference. Night vision is so clear both inside and outside of the car. With new CMOS sensor and F1.4 aprture in the front, night time video is super clean. and 4 IR LED lights for interior camera help to see everything inside the car in night time as well.2. The Dash cam take up to 256GB of Micro SD card, since you have 3 lens all working at same time and at full resolution a 3 minutes clips from all 3 cameras will be about 700MB in size, you will need large SD memory card to hold all the video footage.3. Super capacitor instead of tiny battery is a must for hot or cold weather. I had many other dashcams that come with tiny battery pack, none of those dashcam will last long in extreme hot weather. In summer the temperature inside a car can go all the way to 150-160F, those tiny battery pack won't last a summer. Capacitor are weather resistant and I don't have to worry about dead dash cam when I need it.4. Larger LED screen is a godsend, because you have 3 camera view now, the larger LED make it much easier to read. and you can switch between different 3 cameras to the main screen to monitor. It is easy to operate and review the clip.5. Wiring the rear camera is surprisingly easy. I was worry about wiring the rear dash cam to my car, but after watch some Youtube video and read other feedback, I was able to do it in 15 minutes. Maybe my Camry is just easy to do it, I didn't have problem to hide all the wire and make it look good.CON1. No Wifi or App support. I think with today's digital age and smart phone, the dash should come with a quick way to access video footage wirelessly to download and share.2. No internal GPS support. a builtin GPS will be a nice feature, you will have to buy GPS mount if you want to get GPS data on the dash cam.3. No Y cable to power and connect to rear dash cam. you will need to run two cables to the main dash cam, one for the rear camera to the side of the main unit, and another cable to provide power on the mounting unit of the main camera. Wish there is a Y cable I can connect both USB C connector to have just one single cable to run to the main unit.4. Video is on codec h.265 format, if you have older computer, it might not support h.265 format. I understand why they need to use h.265 codec because all 3 cameras at 2K or FHD do increase the video size, and h.265 has better efficiency compare to the h.264. So don't be surprise when you try to watch the 2K video on your 8 years old laptop, the video is not able to play, you can still hook up the dash cam directly to your 60+ inch TV with Micro HDMI cable. Another way you can do is upload it to Youtube and it will encode again but you will lost quality on the video.Overall: The Vantrue N4 is a very good upgrade from N2 Pro, and one of the best 3 channel dash camera you can buy in the market. If you need to get a dash camera for you car, don't settle on the budget camera that will go bad in a year, get the N4 and have peace of mind to know it will work every time you start the engine with clear video when you need it.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this after a fairly brief look at online comparisons. Installed this system in a 2016 extra long MB Sprinter based RV. Suction mount reasonably secure. Rear camera mounts with UHB tape, and they include an extra piece if you want to move it. Setup was trivially easy. Video quality is good. Video is *not* 4k on the front camera unless you run it by itself; best you can do with all three cameras running is 1440p front and 1080p cabin and rear at 30 fps. That resolution is, however, more than adequate for anything I want to do with the camera. Files are stored time stamped, in mp4 format, with an 'A', 'B', or 'C' at the end of the file name to indicate which camera it came from. Event recorder is a little touchy with factory setting, which is OK. 'Event' files get stored in a separate directory from the continuous ones so they don't get overwritten as soon. You can force the current recording into the Event directory by touching the leftmost button on the top. All in all a fairly sane setup.Cons: No wireless access to the files, let alone live feed. I can sort of understand this as it would increase power consumption, but in an age when your refrigerator has wifi your dash cam should have some kind of wireless capability. I was unable to get the camera to connect to a Linux laptop via USB-C, but the laptop could read the card just fine in its own reader. The screen is pretty small if you want a usable backup camera. To get GPS tagging on your files you have to buy a separate GPS mount... but its cheap. I like the camera well enough that I ordered the GPS mount (which uses UHB tape instead of a suction cup). Rear camera view at night is just black without additional light (pretty hard problem to solve with the camera mounted behind tinted glass -- could put an IR LED on the back of the van I suppose but not sure if the back camera does IR). Side view on the front camera is blacked out at night (again, hard problem to solve when you have full headlight illumination in the center of the field of view, so acceptable).Pro: They actually seem to have a customer service department! I mounted the camera in a vehicle that is over 21 feet bumper to bumper. The 6 meter cable they include for the rear camera, which would be fine in almost any other vehicle, isn't long enough to do any kind of sane cable management in the van. The cable is USB-C on one end, but the end that plugs into the camera is a weird, I assume proprietary 1/16\" or so 4 conductor phono plug. It wasn't clear whether a USB-C extender would work. I looked for a longer cable online and there was nothing (except, it turns out, on the Amazon Japan website). I contacted the company via email and received a prompt, intelligible reply; turns out they have a 9 meter cable available in China and Japan, and they are sending one.Unknowns: I haven't been in a position to evaluate whether files will finish saving before the power goes out in a wreck (see another review that mentions this). I am hopeful that the high bond tape mount will help with this if it ever becomes an issue. I am not sure how well the GPS position and speed tagging works, but hope to find out soon. Another reviewer mentioned a problem with the GPS format.All in all seems like a solid product so far, and one of very few solutions if you want a camera looking ahead at the road, another looking at the cop coming up behind you, and a third to show that you weren't texting, weren't speeding, and didn't do anything suspicious.",

                "reviewText": "Update: After some back and forth with customer support and sending them more information about the problem, they sent me a replacement camera. I've updated my review to reflect that and my general happiness with the camera itself.For 18 months (not coincidentally the length of the warranty), I loved this dashcam. It was easy to set up and operate, and the picture quality from all three cameras was great.At 19 and a half months, the main (front) camera died. Tried the basic stuff - reboot, update firmware - with no luck. So I contacted support. In fairness, they responded quickly and were at least polite. However, there response was that their corporate policy was to provide no support for any hardware issue outside of the warranty period, nor would they offer a paid repair option, and I would have to buy a completely new camera from them to resolve the issue.I knew the camera was out of warranty; I was ready to pay even half the cost of the camera to get it fixed. But at $300, I expect a camera to last at least two years and to get more than an 'oh well, bad luck for you' from support even outside the warranty period.",
