Really like that once installed it turns itself on when you start the car and off when you turn the car off, so its always recording with little effort on the driver's part. Easily paired with your phone via the app, able to pick any recordings to download to your phone and save to your camera roll or text to someone else. Very happy with the product and have ordered a second for our other vehicle.",

                "reviewText": "As far as dashcams go, this is pretty standard fare. I won't go into highlighting all the goods, as if I don't mention it, you can assume it's fine. I bought this as a gift for family member but I have had experience with multiple types of dashcams myself.For the main power cord, it's USB-C. That's great. The problem is the 12 volt power connector is integrated with the cable which means it's all one piece. A better solution would be a 12 volt power plug with a USB type A connector, and then a USB type A cable to USB type-c cable to deliver power. For some cars that don't have multiple 12 volt power ports or USB ports, this occupies the entire 12 volt port. Fortunately since it's Type-C, I can easily swap out the whole power cable with a 15-watt rated 12 volt power plug, and a 10-ft USB type A to USB type-c cable.The rear camera, as far as I could see, did not have a software function to flip the image. Initially I installed the camera upside down. There was no indicator I saw as to which direction was correct. Fortunately, the adhesive did not set fully and I was able to readjust it. A pro here is the rear facing camera is adjustable easily, and is not the crappy kind in a lot of dash cams.Comes with a trim tool and extra parts which are helpful with installation. Comes with an extended warranty from the manufacturer. So far decent image quality. I was not able to test the Wi-Fi function and have yet to see actual footage, as the vehicle isn't mine. For the price, this is great overall. It's not perfect but completely livable.",

Clips cut and loop every 4 minutes or so and doesn\u2019t take up space on my phone since it\u2019s all in the app, unless you download them. Comes with 64gb storage so you don\u2019t need to buy anything extra, except an external hard drive if you want 24hr monitoring, which I\u2019m fine without. Video quality is decent for the price, the front camera is noticeably better quality than the back. Been having it for 2 months now and works well. Overall gets the job done if you want a system that documents proof of car accidents.",

                "reviewText": "The camera is easy to set up and run. Picture quality is good enough to read license plates at maybe 25 ft - not quite what I had hoped, but still pretty good, considering it's an ultra-wide-angle lens. The exposure isn't bothered too much by sunshine. Haven't tried it yet at night.My only gripe is that the power adapter goes from a male cigarette lighter plug to a USB-C plug. Most cars (like mine) have only one cigarette lighter jack that runs off of the accessory circuit, and we often like to run more than one device (e.g. cell phone charging). It would be so much more useful to have a USB-A to USB-C cable, so that it could be plugged into a cigarette lighter - to - dual USB port adapter.The rear camera cable is probably long enough to go from the windshield, around the ceiling molding, to the rear of a full-sized SUV (I think). I recommend powering the device by installing a 12V to USB-A adapter in the interior fuse block area, using a piggyback fuse holder. Then run an extension USB cable behind the trim to the upper windshield. Make the final connection with a very short USB-A to USB-C cable. They're available on Amazon as short as 6\". Using this method, you won't use up valuable cigarette lighter connections.",
