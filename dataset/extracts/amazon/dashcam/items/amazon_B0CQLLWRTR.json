This dash cam supports a maximum of 128GB SD card (64GB TF card is included in the package). 4. Regularly format the micro SD card.

The included power adapter sports a very long cable, good for the long run around the windshield to hide the cable. It doesn't have an always on internet connection which is good in my opinion, you need to get the footage off manually. While the sensor is very small it does take a reasonable quality video. H265 encoding is included which should extend the life of your SD card and enable more recording, most computers support this format now.Likes- Easy installation and operation- No need for the app unless you want to change a setting (defaults are 2K @ H.264)- Included car adapter has a USB Type-A port- Confidence monitor on the back of the unit lets you in on vital stats and operation- Lightweight, which is good in case of an accidentImprovements- A 12v accessory passthrough would be more welcome than a USB Type A port- App is required to change settings and is not on the app store, so there's a security risk involved- Confidence screen in the rear is very small limiting the usefulness of the information displayed- Single button operation is very limitedOverall for the cost at the time of writing ($56 + 25% coupon) it's a great way to get into dash cams. You'll get everything you need to get started and gain some valuable experience with dashcam technology without breaking the bank.",

                "reviewText": "Well packaged 2K dashcam with few features or options for mounting. There are two options for software, Waycam which is a QR code listed in the instruction manual was difficult to install and was flakey working. The camera itself had a QR code to install GoLook which looked like a different version of Waycam but worked much better and was more stable. You must use a WiFi connection to your phone to get video\u2019s off the camera, or you can remove the 64gb mem card from the camera to remove video\u2019s manually with a card reader on your PC. Video clarity was good using the 2K setting. The only mounting option was 3M two sided tape, so permanent, but the only power option provided was a cigarette lighter plug which I deem as temporary. They should have included a suction cup mount for temporary installations or a long USB-C hardwire cord for permanent installs. As an emergency video recorder this is OK but there is no way to add a rear camera to the system. The manual, as with most electronics that comes from China is almost useless except for an extensive troubleshooting questions/answers guide, apparently there are lots of things that can and will go wrong. Still, for $57 it\u2019s OK if it lasts.",

                "reviewText": "If all you want is to record video while the car is moving, this will do the job. Not many extra features but it has what you need. There is a small screen on it so you can see any error messages and that it's recording. The screen cannot be used for playback. I kept getting an SD card error (64gb card is included) so I put in my laptop and repaired it. The error went away. We will see if the error comes back. To play back video you can remove the SD card and put it in a computer or use the GoLook App in the play store. Do not use the App that is referenced in the manual as that takes you to a Chinese web site where they want you to side load a different App. I would not do that! The GoLook app connects to the camera via a private access point in the camera. A bit awkward, but once you connect you can view saved videos and change some settings. I did not see any settings that needed changing. Some of the settings just display a blank dialog. App appears unfinished and has poor English. I probably will not use it. Good value for the price.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The Good:- The camera quality is good. There is a good field of view and decent framerate. It captures video and details well at night. When the car is stopped, I'm able to see the license plate of the car in front of me (day or night).- It's small, so it doesn't take up too much windshield space- It can work with a standard USB C cable and car charger that I normally use to charge my phone- Comes with 10 ft long charging cable and 64GB microSD cardThe Bad:- The screen CAN NOT be turned off or dimmed. Luckily it's small, but it can be distracting while driving.- There's a constant blinking LED to tell you it's recording, which I don't know why it's necessary since the screen has a recording status on there already. Again distracting.- There's only one method of install, by using the sticky tape on your windshield and it can not be tilted up or down. But I think it'll work for most people (behind or just below their rear view mirror).- Changing settings can only be done through the phone app- The app (WayCam) isn't available on the Google Play Store. Have to download from some Chinese site that I wasn't able to install on my phone due security settings I need for my work. I instead installed the app on an old unused phone. There isn't much on the app other than to download the files from the camera to your phone and a few settings. If you are just using the default settings (which I am), I would just manually take the SD card out and download the files to my computer if there was actually an event I needed to save...and I would skip the app altogether.- There is no ability to mute the mic or pause the recordingOverall, it's a low profile basic dashcam with a tiny screen that stays on all the time and nothing else.",

If you invest some time in going through the provided manual booklet (which only takes about 5-10 minutes to read), or at the very least, give it a quick skim, setting up and using the product becomes a breeze. The features and quality at this price point are unbeatable. So far, I'm very pleased with this product.",
