                "reviewText": "Review of Dash Cam Front and Rear, 1080P Full HD Dash Camera for Cars with 32GB SD Card, 2.45'' IPS Screen, 170\u00b0Wide Angle, Night Vision, Parking Monitor, Loop Recording, Motion DetectionA few months ago, I was at a stoplight, in a turn lane, with a large work truck in front of me and a car behind me. The driver of the truck decided that he wanted to go to the next turnoff instead, so he throws it in reverse and hits the gas. He backed into me hard enough to total my little 1991 Ford Escort. Fortunately, he was honest enough to not take off and admitted to what he had done. Had he not been, I would have been left sitting there or trying to prove that I did not run into him while he was stopped. Most people that are not involved in an accident won\u2019t bother to stop and provide a witness statement either anymore. So, I decided to get a dashcam for both of my vehicles.This had good reviews overall. It is not an expensive dashcam and it has a rear camera too. It comes with a 32GB SD card, and with the loop recording, it is sufficient to do the job. This thing is pretty small, but it does not obstruct your view and is easily mounted out of the way, plus has very little weight to it. It comes with 2 ways to mount it on the front windshield, a suction cup (my preferred since I don\u2019t like to adhere things to parts of my car with 3M) and 3M tape. The suction cup worked well and has a little dial to turn to the right to finish the suction. I note this because I did not notice this at first and wondered why it was not suctioning all the way. Also provided are some (3 or 4) cable retainers with 3M backing, and I used 1 of these to keep the rear camera cable up near the top of the front windshield where it feeds into the front camera.There is no phone app. The User Interface is all on the front camera and is not overly complicated with a little fidgeting. The camera is easy to position and tighten down. The rear camera is easily mounted too. I found it somewhat difficult to ensure that the rear camera was plugged in all the way, both into the front camera and at the joining of the cables for the rear camera. The power cable is ample, but I plan to use a fused hardwire kit so that I can utilize the parked feature. The resolution (front 1080P HD front, 720HP rear) is sufficient for my uses in this, my work vehicle that replaced my totaled one. The rear is rated waterproof. The field of vision is sufficient.The rear camera cable is long enough for smaller cars with some left over probably. I put this in a 2002 Ford Taurus SEL. I saw where some people put the rear cameras on the outsides of their vehicles, under a spoiler, or even near the license plate. Even if I ran the cable just onto the floor down the middle of the vehicle, it would not be long enough to get to the rear of my vehicle onto the spoiler or license plate. I did hide the cable along the right side of the inside of my vehicle, from top to bottom, and then along the right-side bottom back up to the rear windshield.The screen on the camera is small enough that I really can\u2019t see it being of much use as a backup camera, especially if it is in split-screen mode. It does not sense backup movement and does not switch modes automatically either. It has a screensaver function, and it can be set to off, or timed to a couple of short modes. I opted to utilize this function and have it set to 30 seconds.For the price, and the features and resolutions, this camera is great. I will strive to update this review with anything relevant. For forty bucks, this is a hard deal to beat.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using another cam for 2 yrs and it was dead. This is a replacement for old one. I was hesitating to buy it at first due to price. I paid $150 for old one but this is a lot less than that. I was curious about quality. But I made my decision and gave it a shot. What a surprise!! It even came with rear cam and micro SD. Set up was super easy and everything was well organized in a box. Tricky part is hiding all wires all the way to backside. But it took me less than 30 min to install neat and clean and turn it on right away when engine starts. Menu is easy and picture quality is great. It is working as same as my old $150 cam. It's a steal with this much of price and quality. I had a car accident before, and my dash cam recorded everything. I submitted my recording and insurance company accepted other's fault right away with it. Recording can be legal proof for accident. I hope that kind thing never happens again, but you'll never know. This is a must to have in your car all the time.",

The camera quality isnt the best but it does the job, at night time it isn\u2019t any better. On the plus side you can sey the time duration to 1 2 or 5 minutes I believe it was. I was super happy to find out it can sense a hit if the cars off and it\u2019ll start recording!!! Definitely worth the price in my opinion",

When reversing the dash cam can serve as a back up camera if your car lacks one. It is easy to operate and set up. I\u2019ve had it for about 2 months now, and I have not had any issues with it. The rain does not impact the rear cam or it\u2019s wiring. I have the wires running outside my car for the rear cam hidden in the trim. It comes with two ways to set up the front dash cam. I used the 3m method and it has stayed in place without issue. It is very easy to lock in video footage while driving. It is just a single click on the cam. The video quality is good. I think this is a good deal as it is an affordable camera. I would purchase from this company again.",

The camera quality is great for both the front and back cameras and the control menu is intuitive and easy to use. It comes with a 32gb memory card that's pre-formatted and it worked straight out of the box for me. It also has little adhesive wire holders to keep the wires from blocking anything important, which I really appreciated. The adhesive holds up really well on those too, I did a 14 hour road trip with the sun hitting the adhesive the whole time and the wires didn't fall down. You're getting a great product for your money's worth with this dash cam. I would definitely recommend it.",

But when I used it, I can't express how thrilled I am with this incredible device. It has truly been a game-changer for my daily driving experience, and I want to share my positive thoughts about it. Setting up the dash cam was a breeze. The user-friendly interface and clear instructions made it a hassle-free experience. I appreciate how it seamlessly integrates into my daily routine. It is a wire dashcam, however, it's super easy to hide and its long enough to connect the back camera and the front camera. The record quality is really good and even at night, the quality is still really good.In summary, I can confidently say that this dash cam has been a fantastic addition to my daily commute. It offers peace of mind, enhances my safety on the road, and provides valuable evidence in case of unforeseen incidents. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and feature-packed dash cam. It's an investment that I'm extremely satisfied with, and I can't imagine driving without it now!",
