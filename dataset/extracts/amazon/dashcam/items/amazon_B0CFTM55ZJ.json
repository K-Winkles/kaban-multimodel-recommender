                "reviewText": "The camera was easy to install and has very clear pictures. This product came with a main front camera and a smaller rear camera. The front camera is suction mounted to the windshield and is on a rotating piece that makes it easy to adjust. Also even though the camera itself can be moved in many ways, once it is set it does not move until you move it. Unfortunately the rear camera that comes with this set does not attach like the front and in fact the rear camera has small screws to mount it with and while this is not a bad thing, this type of setup does not work too well with a pick up truck (specifically flat rear windows). Another thing is that this type of setup does not work for those who do not wish to potentially damage their interior trying to mount this camera properly. The rear camera aside the main camera works perfectly.",

Quality of picture clear, night time vision clear enough and could improve but it\u2019s worth the buy. Back up camera is a plus addition. Only took one adjustment and the length of wire is good enough. Just have to keep up with SD card in and output of media to keep reusing card. The app setup was a process but has been running smoothly. My sister loves the product and was great watching her setup and raving about it on text about what and how it\u2019s been going and it has been only good things. So happy it was great choice!!",

You will need to buy your own double sided tape because the one recieved with the cam didn't work at all, but that's really nothing. Instructions aren't the clearest, but its easy to figure out. I definitely recommend this because it works great.",

                "reviewText": "1st - as far as I can tell, this is not a front and rear view recording camera. It appears to record only front views, but acts as only a back-up camera for the rear view and does not record the rear view and actually I think continuously shows the rear view - with no interlock to power from the reverse lights (the instructions sure don\u2019t help here). So\u2026 if you are impacted from the rear, the incident will not be recorded by the camera.2. The instructions are microscopic. At least the manufacturer could do is to give you instructions you can read without a magnifying glass. The height of the printed letters here are about 1/32 of an inch.3. Not only are the instructions microscopic, but they are an absolutely awful translation from Chinese into English. - worse even than there typical awful translations found in Chinese products.4. Here\u2019s what the instructions have to say about installation of the rear view camera:\u201cThere are two installation methods: 1. The rear-view mirror (I think this should read \u201crear-view camera\u201d) is installed above the inner of the rear view windshield\u2026 (accompanied by a picture of where to in still it) . 2. The rear-view mirror is installed above the rear of the car to take pictures\u201d (with exactly the same picture as in method 1). Not particularly helpful.What I think these instructions say is that the camera may be mounted above the rear window on the interior of the car, or above the rear window on the exterior the car .5. It would be helpful if there an explanation of exactly what the rear view camera does. Is it just a backup camera with no recordation - or does it record a rear view from the rear of the car?6. This helpful message is included in the instructions:\u201d The mount is adhesive and may be destroyed if it is removed from the windshield\u201dThe mount is not adhesive - it is a rubber suction cup - which will not destroy anything if it is removed. The rear camera is apparently installed with screws through a metal bracket on the camera.This camera is going back.",
