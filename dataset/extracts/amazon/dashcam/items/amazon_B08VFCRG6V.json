                "reviewText": "Notice: On a sidenote... Depending on where you reside and your local jurisdiction, the suction mount provided, may be an illegal method to mount this camera on the windshield. Check with your local ordinances, rules and regulations.In my opinion, this is built a bit on the bulky-side. It can draw unnecessary attention, indicating to others, you have a camera. This can be good and/or bad. Not a fan of big/large branding logos on the products itself.The camera itself, is built solid. Camera lens is clear for general purpose day use, but does lack in other aspect. Lens/camera, picture, contrast, color, exposure, settings, are adequate for its intended purpose. Transcend is a solid brand, well known with the PC industry. The memory card it comes with is a 64 Gb Endurance series. The power cable it came with, on the other hand, is the standard straight-plug and not the 90 degree plug, as it's shown in the manual.The camera is packed with features. Please study (with trial-and-error) the online user guide thoroughly to understand each function. The app is useful, but can be improved. Video recordings has time, date, GPS, estimated speedometer and other information. Transferring and obtaining files is somewhat intuitive and easy (either removing the card media and transferring them manually or transferring via the app. Transferring speed is fast. The unit is smart enough to store all previously set settings and powering options will trigger modes you set.The only downside I saw, was during night time use. (Front-facing camera is set to the highest setting - 1080p @60fps) Other vehicle license plates cannot be read unless the camera is within a distance of about ~5 to ~7 feet away (in other words, less than a vehicle's length). This might be due to exposures, but will have to continually test to find out. Daytime videos are somewhat better. Anything past this distance becomes a blur. This happens when headlights are both ON or OFF. When ON, the camera sees the plates as washed-out. When off, the camera has a tough time picking-up letters and number, even with surrounding ambient lighting, other vehicle headlights or other neighboring lighting from streetlights, building lights, etc... This wouldn't be useful in a, say, hit-and-run incident.Rear-facing camera is ok (both day & night use with infrared lighting); can give important details during an accident, but can be improved.",
