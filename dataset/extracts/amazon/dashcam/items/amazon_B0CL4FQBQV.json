                "reviewText": "Vantrue S1 Pro 2.7K Dual Dash Cam Review: A Feature-Packed Option for Savvy DriversThe Vantrue S1 Pro is a premium dual dash cam that packs a lot of features into a compact and discreet package. With a high-resolution front camera (2.7K at 60fps) and a 1080p rear camera, the S1 Pro captures clear and detailed footage day and night. It also boasts a range of impressive features, including:Sony STARVIS 2 HDR Night Vision: This sensor and technology combination ensures excellent low-light performance, capturing crisp details even in dimly lit conditions.5G WiFi for Easy Video Transfer: Share your footage quickly and easily with your smartphone or other devices using the built-in 5G WiFi.Built-in GPS: Track your location and speed data, which can be overlaid on your recordings for added context.Voice Control: Conveniently control the dash cam hands-free using voice commands.24 Hours Parking Mode: Keep an eye on your car even when you're parked, with motion detection and collision recording.Support for up to 512GB SD cards: Store hours of footage without having to worry about running out of space.My Experience:I've been using the Vantrue S1 Pro for the past few weeks, and I'm overall very impressed with it. The video quality is excellent, both day and night. The HDR technology does a great job of balancing the contrast in bright and dark areas, so you can always see important details like license plates. The 5G WiFi makes it easy to transfer footage to my phone, and the voice control is a handy feature for when I have my hands full.One of the things I particularly like about the S1 Pro is its compact size. It's small enough to be tucked away behind your rearview mirror, so it doesn't obstruct your view while driving. The installation process is also straightforward, and the included adhesive mount is secure and easy to adjust.Here are a few things to keep in mind:The S1 Pro requires a separate hardwire kit for 24-hour parking mode.The touch screen can be a bit small and finicky to use at times.The price tag is on the higher end for a dash cam.Overall:The Vantrue S1 Pro is a top-notch dash cam that offers excellent video quality, a wealth of features, and a user-friendly design. If you're looking for a feature-packed dash cam that won't disappoint, the S1 Pro is definitely worth considering.I would definitely recommend the Vantrue S1 Pro to anyone looking for a high-quality dash cam with all the bells and whistles. It's a great investment for peace of mind on the road.",

                "reviewText": "In 2021 I purchased two Vantrue S1 4K Dash Cams Front and Rear, 1080P Dual GPS Dash Cameras for my two cars. Both of the camera sets are reliable and have worked very well. The videos are clear and very useable. I had the cameras hard wired into each car. The cameras have provided excellent documentation of two near misses involving 18 wheelers while on long cross country trips that would have been invaluable had there been an accident. The S1 is a very good value.I have since purchased (2024) the newer version of the S1, the Vantrue S1 Pro 2.7K Front and Rear 5G WiFi Dual Dash Camera. The S1 Pro has the same high quality video recording. The newer camera offers several upgrades and improvements over the S1, but at a higher price. The S1 Pro cameras are more compact. The front camera is slightly smaller than the S1and the rear camera is quite a bit smaller. The S1 required removal from its windshield mount since it was mounted behind the rear view mirror and to be unplugged from both its power supply and the connection to the rear camera and then plugged into a power supply to reset any changes made from its menus,. The new S1 Pro can now be controlled from The Vantrue Phone App on your phone or by voice control making it much easier to use and the changes can be made with the camera mounted. The menus built into the camera are somewhat confusing to use, but the initial set up and making changes from the app are very clear and straight forward. The S1 Pro also provides for a larger memory card 512gb vs 256gb. The GPS seems to be more accurate on the S1 Pro as well. The Vantrue phone app provides other features, such as a map of your route and downloading the videos to your phone, that would not otherwise be available.In addition to using the cameras as dash cams, I have also used them in our boat to record views from our boat and when I Autocross a classic sports car. When viewed on my computer, the picture quality is excellent. When using the cameras in these ways I use extra windshield mounts and a regular power cable.Vantrue has provided excellent customer support and service.",

I recently picked up the Vantrue S1 Pro 2.7K Front and Rear Dash Cam, and as an amateur, I'm genuinely impressed with what it brings to the table.The 2.7K resolution is a noticeable upgrade from standard dash cams, giving me sharper and clearer footage. The STARVIS 2 Dual HDR Night Vision is a game-changer on dimly lit roads, ensuring I capture what's happening even after sundown.What really caught my eye is the 1440P 60FPS feature \u2013 the video playback is so smooth, it's like watching a mini movie of my drives. Plus, the fact that it's a hidden dash cam means it doesn't distract from the overall look inside my car.The built-in GPS is handy for keeping tabs on where I've been, and the voice control adds a cool, futuristic touch.I'm no tech expert, but having these features at my fingertips makes me feel like I'm driving into the future.The 24 Hours Parking Mode is a peace-of-mind feature, especially when my car is parked overnight. I don't have to worry about potential incidents going unnoticed.As for storage, supporting up to 512GB is more than enough for my needs.I can record my drives without constantly worrying about running out of space.The 5G WiFi is a nice touch for easy file transfer and accessing footage on my phone.The app is straightforward, even for someone like me who isn't super tech-savvy.In summary, the Vantrue S1 Pro has made me feel more secure on the road, and the extra features make it a fun addition to my car.For an amateur like me, it's been a solid investment in upgrading my driving experience.",

                "reviewText": "The video quality of this dashcam varied - very good for bright sunny days, but below average in night-time videos (compared to the 4K dashcam that I already have), even with its HDR capability. This may be a consequence of its 2.7K resolution vs. the 4K resolution, but the difference was quite dramatic, as its night time video had trouble with clearly capturing license plates of cars beyond 15 ft from the dashcam, even with the license plate illuminated by my car's headlight. However, in daylight, the video is sharp with good quality colors. With the video recorded at 60fps (you can also record in 30fps), the video is smooth, and you can pause the video to clearly see the road sights zooming by even when the car is going 70 to 80 km/hr.You can use up to a 512GB microSD card with this video, great for storing and recording large volume of videos. I very much appreciate the fact that I can set the video loop time from 1, 3 to 5 minutes, which my other dashcam does not provide.The GPS accuracy is not the best -- there speed calculated by the onboard GPS seems to be about 3 to 4 km/hr slower than my car's native speedometer. So, I probably would not rely on the speed recorded by this dashcam for any critical or legal applications.The one performance aspect that I didn't find particularly consistent was the parking mode -- it doesn't consistently trigger the recording when the car experience an impact (i.e., as I suddenly push down on the car's front, or walk across the field-of-view while the car is in parking mode). I will continue to experiment with the the customization for motion detection area to see if it can improve.Setting it up was super easy - it took me all of 20 minutes to mount it on the inside of my front windshield and routing the cables down to the power source.",
