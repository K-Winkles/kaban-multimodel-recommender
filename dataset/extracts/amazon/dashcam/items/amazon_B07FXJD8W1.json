If you need to find an ignition switched fuse, put the key in the vehicle, find the fuse which is not lit up while the car is off, and test it by turning the car on to see if it lights up. If your kit requires constant power, turn off the car and remove the key to see which fuse slots stays lit on. Connect the Red Wire Once you've determined which fuse slots you need to use for your hardwiring kit you can crimp the red wire of your hardwire kit onto the Add-A-Fuse. Gently remove the fuse you identified. Install the fuse you just removed into the installation kit add-a-fuse circuit. Plug the add-a-circuit into the fuse box in the correct orientation. Ground the Hardwiring Kit Slip the black wire (which is in the shape of a C) under a metal bolt or screw in your vehicle (this is the ground wire). Check that it is not attached onto plastic parts. You will typically need a socket wrench to loosen the nut or bolt that you choose to ground with. To attach the grounding terminal, loosen the nut or bolt enough to slip it in and tighten it back up afterwards. DUAL SLOT FUSE HOLDER It provides one fuse holder to protect original circuit and provides a lead with the second fuse holder for new circuit.",

                "reviewText": "Update April 3.Bought two kits for me and my wife. Installed in Jan. Both Worked perfectly for a couple months, then it started having issues. First the camera would turn on/off intermittently while driving. I thought it was the fuse so replaced that- moved it to the radio so it had constant power. Then the power would cut mid drive, usually as I brake and accelerated. I figured it was a loose connection. After tinkering for a week, I decided to replace the kit with the original cable and charger (plugs into the cig lighter) and works perfectly. Drove it around and no issues.So the problem was the power supply... probably something came loose inside. Either way, 2 months is unacceptable. I did mangle it trying to fix it, and being $10, it\u2019s not worth the hassle to return.-original review-This is for the wiring kit only. Works perfectly, and the instructions on YouTube makes it really easy to follow.Takes about 30-60 minutes depending on how fast you can wedge the wires behind the A-pillar and route it to the fuse box.The fuses are on the cheaper side. I installed one, then decided to move it to another location. When I went to pull the fuse, it fell apart, so I had to go to O Reilly\u2019s and buy a new fuse for a dollar. No biggie- just a bit of a bother.The camera comes with a wedge tool, and having the second one from this kit makes it very easy to walk the wires behind the panel pieces.Very much worth the price to route the cables out of the way, and connect directly to the fuse box. Otherwise, the camera would have to be connected to the lighter/aux for power, and that just looks ugly.",

                "reviewText": "NOTE: This is not instructions of how to install this product. You do so at your own risk. Have a qualified installer install this as you can do, but not limited to, destroy your car, damage the dash cam or cause a fire.I purchased three of these kits and installed it with the AKASO DL9 Rear View Mirror Dashcam.It comes with a pry tool which is fine but it is on the smaller side. A separate pry tool kit may make it easier. A simple multimeter is also required as you'll need to find power with accessory or ignition (up to you) as will as ground. A screwdriver or drill driver may be necessary as well.Installation was self-explanatory. Before you unpackage the item, visually inspect your car and find where the fuse panel is located. In one car it was near the kick panel on the driver's side and on another it is located inside the glove box.Once I found the fuse box, I mentally made a note of how I was going to route the wiring from the fuse box up to the rear view mirror. This determined what covers I needed to remove. Open your dash cam kit package and verify its contents.I started by probing at the fuse box with the multimeter to find power when accesory is on. Then I used the included fuse taps. The fuse taps unfortunately did not fit on one of my cars so I just hardwired it into one of the fuses itself. I put it on the legs that sends out power, not the one that receives it. It's an added layer of security for myself but still it is NOT RECOMMENDED. Also found ground on a metal on the cars chassis. I used an existing screw that was on the car body near the fuse box.Also to be on the safe side I added an In-Line fuse between the red power wire going from the fuse box into the circuit on the dash cam kit. Used wire cutters to cut off the metal connector on the end of the power wire and then spliced the inline fuse wire in. Soldered and then used heat shrink wrap for wires to cover the splice. The circuit apparently comes with a fuse inside but I didn't want to take any chances.Took off pillars, plastic covers, etc. and routed the wiring up to and through the headliner near the camera. In one car I needed to unscrew the vanity mirror or other screws in order to give space to send the wiring through.This is an excellent product and I have not had any problems",

I desired to use the parked protection functionality of the dashcam and one of these kits was recommended. I opted for the fused ones since they seem to be easier to install than the others that require wrapping wires around existing fuses. These types add an additional layer of protection to your automobile\u2019s electrical system.There is ample cable to hide the wires and run them up to the windshield mounted dashcam like I want to do. If you\u2019re like me and are not mechanically inclined, I encourage you to watch a couple of YouTube videos to get a better understanding of how to install these correctly. It is not all that difficult, but the instructions that come with it do not thoroughly explain how to do the install properly. Also handy to have is a multimeter or volt pen so you can check fuses to use. Comes with a tool to assist in tucking wires.Hope this helps someone decide about this product.",

                "reviewText": "This is the kit you need to buy if you're looking to hardwire your dashcam. I initially purchased another hardwire kit (atato) and it not fit in into my fuse box, unfortunately. After looking around Amazon, I came across this product and I'm glad I did. It comes with everything you need and a selection of various fuse types and the matching fuse tap cables to go with it.Installation was very straight forward, however, make sure you get a circuit tester or a multimeter to ensure which terminal is positive and negative in the fuse slot you are tapping into. If you install the fuse tap in the incorrect orientation you can blow a fuse so double check your work. There are many youtube videos that will you give you step by step instruction on how to properly select fuses whether you're looking for constant or acc power installation. In addition, these videos will show how to check which fuse is positive and negative. Before you start working in your fuse box, be sure to properly read your car's manual and see which fuse you can safely tap into, do not tap into any fuse that are critical components of the car such airbags, abs, and any fuses that are related to the engine. You want to find a fuse that is labeled as an accessory or nonessiential.I installed this fuse tap into my cigarette lighter fuse and it worked beautifully. The power cable on the hardwire kit is long enough so you can tuck it under the panels of your car to have proper cable management and a clean looking install. I'm very happy with this product and would highly recommend this kit to anyone looking to hardwire your dashcam in your car.",
