                "reviewText": "I've had several car dashcams over the years and I was interested to see how this one would perform. First off, this dashcam like most others have a fish-eye effect. Similar to other dashcams, navigating the menu options are awkward. It takes a while to get used to the men controls to customize your dash cam.The suction cup mechanism is about as good as my previous one so far.The color of the videos it records isn't as vibrant as my preferred dashcam. I don't like that the files are saved with a weird file extension. It confused me because I was expecting a MP4 file extension. However, I am happy to report that H.264 video settings plays fine.I played with the WiFi feature and I was able to get it to connect and work during testing. However, I still find myself preferring to pull the MicroSD card out directly and then insert it into an SD card adaptor to access the files. The reason why is it is still a hassle to try to get your phone to connect to Wifi to get the files.In any case, I tend to prefer to download videos directly to my computer because that is where I do the most of my video work.I have not yet tested the rear camera capabilities mainly because I don't want to bother running the wire to the rear windshield. I feel I have enough cables in my car as it is and I'm not yet motivated to record the rear view.Overall, the camera is okay. It works but I really look for vibrant colors and minimized fish-eye effect where I can.",
