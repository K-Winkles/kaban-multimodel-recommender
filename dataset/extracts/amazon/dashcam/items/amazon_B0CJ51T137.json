                "reviewText": "This is the perfect dashcam if you want something you can set up and forget about it until you need it. No annoying visible light emitted at all, which is very nice for driving at night. No GPS either and you can turn off the speaker and all sound recording.Setup is very simple and intuitive. Somehow the dash cam knows the correct time and date even the right time zone without having to be set. I have no idea how it does this.I did not use the included micro SD card because it is only 32gb.The only negatives to this dash cam are universal to all 2.4ghz wifi dash cams.1. If you have wireless Apple CarPlay you can initially connect to the dash cam but it is going to constantly disconnect and reconnect to CarPlay.2. Video download is painfully slow on a 2.4 ghz WiFi connection.My workaround to both these problems was to buy a microSD card reader that plugs into my phone. Works flawlessly whenever I want to review footage.",

Must be plugged into the car's cigarette lighter outlet, which means you will be running a wire across the top of your windshield, down the side and back across the dashboard. There are instructions for how to tuck it into the trim, but it takes longer than it should. Also a problem is fitting it on a windshield that comes with the upper part blackened for vehicle advanced features. Because you need to attach it to a clear space, that means you'll be putting it far enough down to partially block the driver's view. And, you will have an ugly wire reaching down from the top of your windshield. Doesn't work with my car, but your results may differ especially if you have a more basic or older model car.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently took the Cosuvow 4K Front Dash Cam for a spin, and the simplicity coupled with its powerful features left me thoroughly impressed. This dash camera doesn't rely on complicated controls or voice commands; instead, it boasts a straightforward one-button operation and a great app (named Viitdure) that allows me to set up settings, and see/download/share media easily! It has crystal clear 4K resolution (3840 x 2160P resolution at 30fps), and stable WiFi that connects to my cell reliably. No need for a Dash Camera display since I have my app helping me to see media and adjust all settings! Brilliant design \u2728\u2728The absence of voice control might seem like a drawback to some, but the simplicity of the design is where the magic lies. One button is all it takes to start it or lock manually the recording, making it incredibly user-friendly. When I turn it on, the recording starts automatically, and the voice announces \"Start Recording\". When I stop recording from the app, the voice announces: \"Stop Recording\". While the voice has a hint of robotic charm, it serves a practical purpose. The dash cam diligently announces when the video recording starts or stops, providing a helpful audio cue. This feature, although seemingly minor, is a game-changer. It ensures that I'm always aware of the camera's status, adding an extra layer of convenience to the overall experience. I would recommend a more pleasant/clear voice though :)\ud83c\udfa5\ud83d\udd0a Now, let's talk about the settings:- Video resolution: 4K or 2K;- Loop recording duration: 1min, 2min, 3min;- Timestamp and audio recording can be set up on/off, and speaker volume adjusted;- COLLISION SENSING: this can be set up as Low, Medium, or High; it will lock the video at the time of the collision. I always prefer to set it up on a medium;- Time-lapse Video FPS: 1sec, 2 sec, 3 sec - 1FPS (frame per sec) is the most memory saving option;- The WiFi name will be displayed as S1-20230823 - and connect automatically- Camera file management: very simple - keeps files in 4 categories: Loop, Snapshot, Locked, and Parking; I can delete, or download as I wish.\u2728The 4K image quality, day or night, is as stunning as ever, capturing every detail with precision. The \"Viidure\" app continues to impress with its intuitive controls, allowing me to manage the dash cam effortlessly from my smartphone. The inclusion of the 24 Hours Parking feature, G-Sensor, WDR (Wide Dynamic Range), Loop Recording, and the bonus 32GB card make this dash cam a comprehensive and reliable choice.In conclusion, the Cosuvow Dash Cam 4K Front strikes a perfect balance between simplicity and functionality. It's a no-fuss solution for those who appreciate a straightforward approach to recording their journeys. The robotic charm of the voice announcements adds character to the experience, making it a dash cam that is effective and keeps me in control. I recommend it, and I will keep in mind this brand for future products \ud83d\ude97\u2728",

                "reviewText": "When I initially ordered this item the title had said Wireless 4k Dashcam and what I have is not that. This product does not feature a rechargeable battery or any type of battery and therefore comes with a long power cable that needs to be wrapped around your windshield and down into the port. Some of its selling features like the 24 hr surveillance and 15 second auto recording actually need a \u201chardwire kit\u201d. Is that the power cord it comes with or something else, I don't even know. So I can only review the most basic of dash cams. And it's fine. The size is okay, small and discreet. The video quality is decent, not a true 4k really but it's not grainy or pixelated. I love that the company included a 32g miniSD because these can be expensive. Though I don\u2019t love that it needs to be formatted on a computer first since none of mine have the miniSD port and I need to buy the adapter first. The adhesive it comes with is great, it's held up in direct sunlight and -15 temps without peeling or falling off. The price for it is okay, pretty comparable for other basic cams.",

                "reviewTitle": "Native 4K camera sensor for sharp videos and powered by USB Type C",
                "reviewText": "This camera is simple to operate using a one-touch button to power on/off and built-in voice speaker which indicates recording status. It's also one of the biggest drawbacks since the camera lacks LCD screen, positioning lens angle can be difficult without having to rely on a smartphone app to preview live stream, check recordings, or change settings over WiFi.// 4K SensorNight vision performance is decent for city driving in well illuminated areas being visible but at a high noise and artifact ratio while darker areas are hard to see due to the high level of contrast on this camera sensor. In daytime the 4k footage outperforms in clarity making plate numbers as far away as 15 to 20 feet readable while stationary and capturing ultrawide angle in detail. There is motion blur from its low 30 FPS frame rate which mostly affects the side edges of camera footage in fast moving scenarios.Internally the camera PCB has markings for native 8MP sensor for clear 4K30 resolution and built-in MicroSD card slot as the only recording mechanism. It does have a Realtek WiFi N chipset outputting limited signal range of about 10ft in open areas or limited to inside vehicles.// PowerPowered by USB Type C not only does this camera work great for driving with decent low-light performance but I've used it flexibly like an action camera or capturing time-lapses at 1 to 3 FPS on its wide angle lens.Although it simply lacks any kind of built-in battery or super capacitor meaning the camera instantly powers off along with the car degrading last few frames of video captured. The included 12V car adapter has a 5V at 1 Amp DC converter with a lengthy USB Type C cable which I was able to hide behind side panels for simple installation.// StorageLive picture stream inside the app only shows preview at low SD 960x544 resolution and requires manually copying 4K footage from MicroSD card to a PC to get full 4K. Included memory card is small 32GB capacity that quickly fills up within an hour of recording because of high bitrate of uncompressed 4K stream but can be configured inside camera settings to 2K resolution.Overall this WiFi camera has sharp 4K videos at 30 FPS on its native 8MP sensor while being easy to configure with single button operation and comes with 32GB MicroSD card capacity to store captured footage.",

                "reviewText": "This Cosuvow Car Dash Cam despite the lack of details in the listing a very decent camera to have at a good price. It is surprisingly better at some things than other dashcams. It uses an adhesive sticker instead of suction cup (you also get an extra adhesive pad, just in case). I hate suction cups, they end up falling all the time, especially when there is a big swing of temperatures. It can record audio and video up to 4K. Personally, I just went with 2K (1440p) as I found it more manageable quality wise and storage wise. The dashcam has a good manual included that explains all the things that you need to know. Surprisingly, a 32GB generic no name SD card is included. It is surprising, as most dashcams do not include an SD card. The SD is not the best, but it will get the job done. The dashcam connects with a USB-C, which is always a good advantage in case the original cable does not work anymore. The camera will announce every time it starts or stops recording, an extremely useful feature to avoid any surprises. The app is decent and does the job as intended. A 2 min video at 2K resolution will take about 260MB of SD storage.There are a few things that I hope it gets fixed in a software update. The camera announcement voice is not very loud, and if there is any external noise, you will have no idea what it just said. The camera angle adjuster is really stiff, and it could be really hard to just adjust it a little bit. The camera app can lag a little bit, and cause some settings to not register.Overall, this dashcam impressed me with some nice features, and I certainly would hope to see more functions added to it.",
