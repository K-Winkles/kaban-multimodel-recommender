Instead, I was pleasantly surprised when the included instructions were very detailed and in passable English. They even included a clear explanation of the types of fuses included with the fuse taps in the kit. I was able to install two of these kits in about an hour with the majority of that time taken up with understanding how to disassemble my glove compartment to access the fuse box. If you are looking to install low amperage USB-powered devices in your car or truck I recommend this kit. It has been in my car for around a month and has worked consistently at every start.",

                "reviewText": "It looked promising when it arrived. It came with multiple connectors, fuses, etc. The install was very easy using a fuse tap and it worked for a total of about one hour in a car that is occasionally driven. All of a sudden, the camera would not charge using this hard-wired cable. The camera was tested and works perfectly (it is new) using the original power adapter. I checked the fuse for this kit and it was not blown. Removed the cable and found that it felt broken in 3 places. This was carefully installed and no sharp corners were encountered. The cable went from above the rearview, across the top of the headliner, down the A-Pillar, to an interior fusebox located in the kick panel. This was a straight forward install that took 15 minutes with no reason for the cable to have broken. THIS CABLE IS FLIMSY AT BEST. DO NOT BUY THIS...THIS IS COMPLETE GARBAGE.",

                "reviewText": "Instructions are kind of vague when it comes to the finer details. If your new to wiring a dash cam in your car, the video on youtube for wiring isn't the best. The fuse tap comes with a 3amp fuse. It just blew right away. So you might want a bigger fuse with it. The tap also was flipped on the accessory fuse port. it doesn't say that upfront in the instructions. But the pictures shown that way and in my case my fuse tap was that way..(It doesn't include a circuit tester for fuse orientation testing so you will need one of those too) There's no cable ties either so you will need to provide those or figure something out. They provided enough cable to have a lot to spare, so that was nice. Mine also had a bad ground connection. They used a needle thin ground wire and it wasn't even spliced enough to make contact with the screw clip. So you may have to splice that when you hook your ground up and it doesn't work.. overall. You pay for what you get. Its alright for the price.",
