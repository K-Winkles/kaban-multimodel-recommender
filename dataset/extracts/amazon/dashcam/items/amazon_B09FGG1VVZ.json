                "reviewText": "2nd Dashcam Ive had to return due to lying in ad or omitting important functions. Got this message after I received it. Why wasnt this sent when I purchased it right away????????Hi friend,This is Surfola Direct.Thank you for your support on Surfola.Have you received our product - SD310?For your better using experience, here we provide you with some warm tips:\u2460You are suggested to use a class 10, SDHC 128GB max supported TF card (We do not suggest you use the 64GB TF card). A TF card should be formatted on the computer as FAT32 64KB and formatted on this unit again at first use.\u2461With the loop recording on, the newest video will automatically overwrite the oldest one when the TF card meets its maximum capacity. However, there is also a function named G sensor in this cam, so the cam will lock the current video when there is a sudden collision/shake and the locked videos won't be overwritten even in loop recording. Also, the videos under parking mode would also be saved from being overwritten. So I do suggest you format the TF card regularly and set the sensibility of the G sensor to a lower value to prevent there is too much locked video taking up the storage space.\u2462After a while the screen shuts off during recording, which is a normal phenomenon named screensaver mode and you needn\u2019t to worry about it. It's just for energy saving while the cam is still recording. If you want to keep the screen stay on when recording, please enter the setting mode and turn off the \u201cscreen saver\u201d.No matter what questions or problems bother you, please contact our professional after-sales team:support.dc@surfola.co(put 5 lines in 1 line)Thank you for your purchase. Have a nice day and take care.Kind regards,Surfola Direct",

If I use this then my cig lighter is useless for other items. If you update your connections I'd keep, but not outdated retired USB type cable. At least A types are easier to find without having to plug into cig lighter directly. You can have this back. I'll pay more for current connections",
