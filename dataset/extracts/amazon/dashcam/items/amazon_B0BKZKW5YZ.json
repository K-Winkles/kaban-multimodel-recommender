I corresponded via e-mail with the company and they were able through videos provided and explanation of what I had tried it was determined the camera was faulty. They immediately sent a new camera to replace the original. Upon receiving the new camera is worked great. It was very easy to set up and operate. The picture quality is fantastic and I am thinking about getting a send camera for our other car. Would definitely recommend to a friend.",
