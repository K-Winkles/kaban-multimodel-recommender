                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Things I wish I knew-Bright red light and iPhone & Wireless Car Play is an issue with Garmin App",
                "reviewText": "The compact size is great and non-obtrusive*. I don't need a screen of my driving on or a large block in my site line. I only want a camera in case of an incident. This fit the bill. I bought 2 of these, the first was for a '20 Mustang without all the Safety sensors and nanny systems tied into the rear view mirror. I liked that it was compact and I put it on the passenger side behind the mirror. More recently, I bought a new Jeep GC 4xe with all the nanny systems. I already had an EZPass tucked on the passenger side with all the sensors spreading into the passenger side, there was no room to tuck the camera like I did on the Mustang. So, I put this latest Mini 2 on the diver's side, using a hard wired Donger USB port (highly recommend) on the driver side. Several issues I have. First is the red light* at night. There is a steady red light indicator that is too bright. I thought I did a good job putting the camera behind the mirror, but I did not account for the little red LED causes a glare, looking like a brake light in my peripheral vision. I had to move the mirror out of my comfort zone to block it. You can tell me to readjust or move the camera but it's a lot of work. Why? Because the next issue is with wireless Apple Car Play. It is not easy to set up with Apple Car Play being wireless because the Bluetooth on my iPhone 13 is a slave to the Car Play. You have to un-pair from Car Play completely to set up your Garmin view, then re-pair with the Car Play (no issue with the hard wired Car Play version in the Stang). So the issue is the Garmin app and wireless Car Play cannot co-exist; you will not get a \"live view\" if connected to wireless Car Play- you will need to disconnect your phone from your car to get the live view. The camera's WiFi shows up on the phone, it just doesn't give the video feed. Not sure if I will keep this one for the Jeep. So be aware of the bright little tiny light and Apple Car Play.",

                "reviewText": "Update October 2023:*****To the other reviewer with the CarPlay issue in their Jeep 4xe****- I have the same car you do not need to completely unpair your phone to connect to the garmin app. All you need to do is click into your device manager by tapping the CarPlay icon on the bottom nav bar and tap your phone to disconnect bluetooth between the two. Then you can connect to the garmin app with no issues and when youre done just tap your phone in the device manager again to reconnect.This dash cam is F***** AMAZING. I cannot believe that this thing is still working like it did day one out of the box. I've never had a dash cam work so well even a year later. Every few months when I turn on the car, it will ask if I want to reformat the sd card to make sure files can continue to save properly and the camera itself can do that. That's awesome! Less human interaction, less human error overall for this, which I believe is also the reason other dash cams start to fail as most users don't even know they need to reformat the sd card let alone know how to or have time to. Most dash cams DON'T do this.It still gets confused with my electric mode when its toggled on (I have the 22 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe), and also when my car will continue to power itself as I walk away and when I walk back up due to the fun tech that registers I'm near (and it starts itself up) so that sometimes screws up parking mode but in the times I've been away and something shook my car it would record and save it. It even would register large movement like the times I'd open the garage door to go take trash out and save it as motion detected.Unfortunately, its not high def enough to catch most plates (but otherwise its quite high quality!), but the one time I really needed it I clicked the save video button and yelled out the state and plate numbers. It caught what I said! Speaking of the microphone I listen to music WAY to loud, and this thing manages to somehow turn down my audio in the recording but still pick up my voice clear as day. Absolutely fantastic. Will be buying a second one for our Jeep Rubicon and off road adventures.I am still confused to this day how it knows my exact coordinates and what speed I'm going... maybe it uses my phone I'm not sure, but it records where you are and your speed and the time, which is great if you ever need it. Honestly might buy a second one just to put it on my back window of my SUV if I can figure out how to get power back there for it. I mean, the app lets you have multiple connected at once, I gotta try this out now that this thing has proven it can last.---------------I have only had this dashcam for at most a week now, so I will come back to update if this dashcam fails me.I've used around 5 or 6 different dashcams in my 8 years of driving and I have to say I've learned a thing or two about what you want to look for when purchasing one after being burned so many times. I've used a few top sellers on amazon, which turned out to be crap. I then tried Vantrue, which also ended up corrupting all my files and never saving them after only a few months. Then I got on the OwlCam train, and got really burned by it. Not to mention, too expensive for such a piece of crap machinery.Now this dashcam I put a *lot of thought* into before buying. I can't stress enough how many times I've been burned. I decided to look based off of the following features:1) is the company that made it real? Like real with their own website?- Most of them aren't, but Garmin has been in the game for a while with car products, so I figured hey give them a try.2) Can the dashcam connect to an app/my phone? If yes, look that app up, see it's reviews in the app store.- This camera as of writing uses the Garmin Drive app, and this app has 4.5K reviews and 4.7 stars on the iPhone App Store. No other app I could find connected to any dashcam had so many and such high reviews. This gave me hope.3) What is the actual recording resolution of the camera? Some companies lie, and it's not actually 4K or whatever they say. Look at youtube reviews with proof of the file format.- Garmin, they did not lie to my knowledge. I can see it. I can't read license plates, but let's be honest. None of the dashcams you can find will. Maybe some in some bizarre cases, but no - don't expect to be able to catch a plate. If something happens, just yell out the plate State and Number so you can hear it in the recording later. Also, don't be stupid, get UNDERinsured driver insurance AND UNINSURED driver insurance. From experience, this saved my sister's literal life.4) Can I have a Live connection to the camera somehow?- NexarOne and Owlcam both have these options, but fail horribly at them. Garmin has a different version of live, and given that this dashcam checked enough of my other boxes, I said fine to this. Better not to be forced to pay some subscription fee anyways. Their Live option just requires some internet connection, so I connected mine to my house wifi, as it sits in my garage. Those who park outside/away from wifi would just have to let it use their phone's data when they are near it instead (which is nice when you are away from home if something happens).Here's my experience so far with this camera:- Placement in the windshield -> I placed it in the center, directly behind my review mirror. I can't see the screen of the dashcam because of where I placed it, but I don't care personally. It blends in with the black interior of my car, you wouldn't know it's there unless you look hard. This is great to not attract as many thieves. It's also SO TINY I am amazed.- Recording--> After trying the different resolution options, I picked the 1440p one. It's the highest def. I also am amazed at the 180\u00b0 view. You can really see the sides of the car, if someone came in to t-bone you I am sure the camera would catch it.--> It starts recording as soon as I turn on the engine, and I noticed in the video recordings that it ironically records my speed as soon as I throw it into drive. I don't know if this is coincidence or not, but I like that it records my speed.--> I like the feature that tells you \"Traffic is in motion\". Sometimes I zone out at long red lights, and this feature is also on my Subaru, but it won't be on my new car when it gets here, so the fact that the dashcam does it is a huge plus to me.--> It has a feature that beeps quickly at you if you cross a solid line. I think it was created to alert drowsy drivers, but I personally don't mind it going off. It's so quick, it only takes your attention for a second or two.--> It also has a feature to yell at you if you're tailing someone to close and it could result in a bad accident. Mine has never gone off, but I also don't tail people. I think it might annoy someone, but at that point don't drive like an ass LOL.- The App & My Phone--> Now I don't know if this thing has a battery in it. I am assuming by it's size that it does not. My car is newer, so it turns off all the ports after I shut the engine off. This camera uses a USB (i have usb ports in my car, it works with those) and comes with an adapter so you can use it.--> I don't have to have the app open, unlike Nexar for example, for the dashcam to work. The dashcam basically works on its own, and has a great integration with the app. You have options to use it basically (whether you want the app or not). I personally prefer the app, as it is easier. I make sure to leave my car in electric mode before I turn it off to double check that the footage was recorded. It's so nice, you just connect to the dashcam via it's \"wifi\" signal, and then you can view the footage on the memory card (or you could plug it in to your computer really easily, but I haven't found a need to do that).--> On the app, you can choose a video that was recorded and upload it to the \"Vault\" from the memory card in it where if you have a \"free\" subscription it will delete in 24 hours. You really don't need footage unless you were in a wreck, so the only way I could forsee someone being screwed over is if the camera footage is only accessible via the app for some reason (maybe the camera was nearly destroyed in a wreck or something) and the driver was unconscious and couldn't get the footage before being taken away. Then again, I could see how you could still get the footage back later, because the dash cam won't overwrite footage that's been labeled \"accident detected\". You're just screwed if your car is robbed and they take the camera with it.--> *AN IMPORTANT NOTE* is that the dashcam will show you lower resolution footage in the app, but if you \"export\" the video, it will compile the actual higher definition footage to which you can easily push it to the \"vault\" (cloud) or to your phone's storage (so the Photos app on iOS).- Things that I didn't expect but love--> This dashcam is the *first* that I've had that can handle how loud I put my music and bass. It doesn't mess the volume up at all. It just lowers the music volume in the recording, but my voice is still loud and clear. AMAZING.--> How tiny it is, so easy to hide. Tuck the wires for it into your side panels, super easy.--> that it uses USB, not hard-wiring. Now when my car is in the shop, it will still record what's happening instead of needing to be unplugged to do data updates and smog tests.--> that you can connect multiple cameras to your account on the app. If this camera holds up well for 3 months, I will buy another and put it as my back camera. They can sync in the app to give you a two in one video with both angles.--> that it doesn't use a suction cup but rather a strong tape, so it won't fall off the window on you. You *can* buy a suction cup attachment for 15$ from garmin if you want--> garmin's website has an interactive manual, which is super nice and easy to use.TLDR: I did my research, so far it's paying off. I hope i don't have to come back and give a negative review in a while when I've been putting it through wear and tear. This dashcam has worked the best out of all I've used, but I am a Computer Scientists, so tech comes very easy to me. I want to say it's fairly simple for non-techy people to catch on to though.",

                "reviewText": "So overall I am happy with the camera, I just have a few small gripes.the good - decent image (only 1080p), easy to use interface, reliable connection for reviewing and dowloading video (my old camera never gave me one clip I really needed, so its a huge improvement there) It works well with the dongar usb adapter that takes power from my mirror so I don't have to wire a cable through my headliner and A pillar.I was also worried about it having no screen, but its really not a big deal and I actually prefer it since it helps keep it lower profile.The bad - no included SD card. It mentions it in one of the pictures in the body of the listing but it should also be listed in the bullet points to be extra clear, if you don't look at every picture you won't know it doesn't come with it.Also, the LED is super bright at night. It doesn't dim compared to daytime. During the day its barely noticeable, but at night if the camera is in your line of sight its very bright. Luckily its mostly behind my rear view mirror so its not too bad for me, but as a passenger it would be annoying.No USB C - I think they kept it micro usb to keep in line with their other accessories, but in todays world I would rather have usb c, but its not a huge deal.Since its not a wedge style camera, you do get a bit more glare compared to other cameras that get closer to the glass, but its not a huge deal. You can get a polarizing filter for it but haven't tried it yet.",

                "reviewText": "For the money this is a solid product. The picture and sound quality are excellent.I knew going in based on other Amazon reviews that transferring files between the device and a cell phone wasn't worth doing. That is very true and the only negative, and really for me just a very minor negative not even enough of an issue to lower my rating. Why the app wants to connect to the device via Wi-Fi is a mystery since it's a pointless means of connecting such devices. There is no Wi-Fi connection while driving, even in your laneway a home Wi-Fi connection is horrible.If you purchase a small SD microSD card reader with USB C connector ($10 to $20 on Amazon). Which is what I did, you can pop the microSD out of the Dash cam and view the videos right there on your cell phone.I downloaded the app created my id, stuck the device on the windshield plugged it in, the device synced with the app and did an update. I closed the app, you don't need it running, the device begins recording once plugged in. I'm not bothering with their paid subscription stuff, I don't see any need.The device records and creates a video file on it's own in 1 minute increments and writes onto the inserted microSD card. You want a video clip from 10 minutes ago it's right there on the microSD in a nice small size to copy, move, delete or share.Since the app uses Wi-Fi to communicate with the device, you won't be watching live views or transferring clips using the app. Unless you like punishment! Bluetooth would be no better so just buy a microSD card reader and enjoy. I will be buying another for the wife's car.",
