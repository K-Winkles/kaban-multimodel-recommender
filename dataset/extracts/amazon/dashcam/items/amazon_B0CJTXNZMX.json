This dashcam was a replacement for another I used for years but finally quit.The screen is small, and it will only show one of the other views (inside and rear). After less than a day, the rear camera view lost its contrast to where the display only shows bright lights, the rest of the view is gray.I'll be shopping for a better dashcam later, you get what you pay for with this one.

The included cables are plenty long enough and it even includes a rear camera (powered by hdmi cord from main camera unit). Camera quality seems to be pretty good, wide angle like most dash cams. I was able to hide the entire length of the cables on my install and put the dash cam behind my rearview mirror so that I can't see it when driving and it captures exactly what it needs to.The bad:-Power cables are MINI USB?! Seriously??? Its 2023, make it USB-C! Mini USB was released in 2000 for crying out loud!-There is a startup jingle that you can't mute or get rid of in any of the settings (I even asked the seller), you can only mute the menu navigation sounds.-Menu options and instruction manual seems like it was translated using Google Translate from Chinese to English.In all, I can live with the cons, it does what it says it does, and works.",
