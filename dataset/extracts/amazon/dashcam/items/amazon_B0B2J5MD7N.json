                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Dash Cam Front and Rear, SPADE Dual Dash Camera 1080P with 32G SD Card, and I am extremely satisfied with its performance. This upgraded version exceeded my expectations in every way possible.First and foremost, the video quality is outstanding. Both the front and rear cameras capture crystal-clear footage at 1080P resolution, ensuring that every detail on the road is recorded accurately. The night vision capability is impressive as well, providing clear visibility even in low-light conditions. I feel confident knowing that the camera captures everything I need for evidence or review.The waterproof backup camera is a fantastic addition. It offers an extra layer of safety and convenience, allowing me to monitor what's happening behind my vehicle effortlessly. The image quality is remarkable, and it greatly assists me in parking and maneuvering in tight spaces.The DVR function is another standout feature. With loop recording, I never have to worry about running out of storage space on the included 32G SD card. The G-sensor technology ensures that any sudden impact or collision triggers an automatic lock on the recorded file, preventing it from being overwritten. This feature has provided me with peace of mind knowing that important footage is always protected.The parking monitor is a valuable asset as well. It keeps an eye on my parked vehicle and automatically starts recording if any motion or impact is detected. This added security measure gives me confidence when leaving my car unattended.Lastly, the overall build quality of the dash cam is exceptional. It feels sturdy and well-made, and the installation process was straightforward. The user-friendly interface and intuitive controls make it easy to navigate through the various settings and customize the camera to my preferences.In conclusion, I highly recommend the Dash Cam Front and Rear, SPADE Dual Dash Camera 1080P with 32G SD Card. Its impressive features, including the waterproof backup camera, DVR functionality, night vision, and parking monitor, make it an excellent investment for any driver. I couldn't be happier with my purchase and the peace of mind it provides.",

                "reviewText": "I went through all kinds of dash cams with different prices and landed on this one. It was easy to install it. I could hide the cable behind the inner cover around the windshield. The front camera is attached to the monitor and the suction cup is strong enogh to hold the monitor. Even on hot summer days, the monitor never came off. It came with long cable for the tiny cam for the back side. The cable was long enough to connect the hind cam to the monitor. I made a hole right above the tag and installed the camera without any trouble. I didn't even need to use the stickers that came with the camera. Even though the hind cam is installed outside, it is not easily noticeable as it is quite tiny.The video quality during daytime is better than I'd expected. Night vision is not impressive but to be fair, I think it's because of the glares from other cars' lights. You can change the views on the monitor like big front view with small hind view, 5:5 front and hind views, front view only or hind view only. The last hind view only is useful to me when I back up for parking since my car doesn't have native camera.After all, after using the dash cam for over two months, I will say this is a very good product. If you are sensitive about price but want a decent quality dash cam, this could be a good choice.",

                "reviewText": "After a lot of research and deciding on this dash cam for both of my vehicles, and after months using this dash-cam, here is my honest and fair review: If you\u2019re looking for a quality economical, entry-level dash-cam, you will not go wrong with this one.1. The front camera has good resolution for its class. Not 4k, but it is higher than that of other brands at this price point. As long as you\u2019re not looking for image quality of a $100-200 product, you should be satisfied as this item will provide sufficient evidence on the road. License plates are quite visible when cars are close enough and likely record it in an accident.2. I have used this in some hot weather. It seems to tolerate heat well, although it\u2019s too early to tell. The quality of this product seems good.3. Customer service and warranty are top notch. Very responsive and helpful. They helped me when the rear cable was a little short for my long-bodied car.4. Everything you need is provided in the box. The 32Gb memory card is sufficient and I never had to re-format it after my initial format from the camera, although it is recommended to format it at least every month. I might upgrade it to a 64Gb or 128Gb card later.*Here\u2019s a few additional tips:- Make sure you remove the adhesive taping on the front camera\u2019s lens before installing. I made this mistake of not removing it and it was burry..- Make sure you clean the windshield front and back to get clear images. I thought the recordings were a little blur, but I found out it was my fault that my windshield had been dirty! Sometimes, the reflection from the dashboard to the glass causes glares too so keep that in mind.- When installing the suction cup, press it against the glass and turn the rotating dial to make it firmly stick. Mine never came off after my initial installation. Also, clean the surface before sticking the cup or cable clips!Hope this helps!",
