This is normally found by the foot well on the driver\u2019s side of your vehicle or under the engine hood. 2. Open the fuse box cover plate to find the fuse map. Locate the Fuse Box and find a Constant Fuse Slot, or ACC Fuse Slot(for NOT USE 24/7 Surveillance Mode). 3. Remove the fuse from the constant fuse slot and insert it into the bottom slot of the fuse we provide the same size. (IMPORTANT: Remember to insert your car's original fuse into the fuse tap if applicable) Use the circuit test pen to identify the positive pole of the fuse slot. 4. Connect the Yellow LINE to the positive pole of the constant fuse slot, or ACC Fuse Slot(for NOT USE 24/7 Surveillance Mode). 5. Connect the RED LINE of the hardwire kit to the positive pole of the ACC fuse slot in the fuse box. ACC fuse slot energizes only when the ignition switch is on. (IMPORTANT: Remember to insert your car's original fuse into the fuse tap if applicable.) 6. IMPORTANT: If the hardwire kit does not provide power, please try to insert the fuse tap in the OPPOSITE direction.",

Installation is very straight forward and easy. In my case, I modified the kit by adding a switch on the Batt wire to be able to disable 24 Parking mode while in my garage. No matter what I did, this first kit would not work. Since I had modified it, I choose to simply order a second kit. This second kit worked only when the Batt wire was connected and switched on and would not work via the ACC wire. I can only assume both items are defective and as such can not recommend this item.",
