                "reviewText": "As we live in Florida with lots of older drivers and we had just bought a new car we felt having a dash camera would be helpful. Cost was also a factor. This camera is a great value, the picture is good, and was easy to install. Hope fully there will be a wireless or Bluetooth version in the future. While the picture is good at times in bright sunlight it is difficult to see from the driver's seat although it is probably where we have mounted the camera more than the camera itself. I would recommend this product.",
