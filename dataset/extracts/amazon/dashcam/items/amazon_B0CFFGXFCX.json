                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this product, and it has exceeded my expectations. The main highlight is the video quality. Both the 4K front and 1080P rear cameras capture crystal-clear footage, making it easy to read license plates and capture details, even in low light conditions. The super night vision feature truly stands out, providing excellent visibility for nighttime driving.The 3.12-inch screen offers a clear and convenient view without being obtrusive. I particularly appreciated the inclusion of a free 64GB SD card in the package, which is a thoughtful addition and saves the hassle of buying one separately. The WiFi connectivity is seamless, allowing for easy transfer and viewing of footage on my smartphone.Installation was straightforward, thanks to the comprehensive set of accessories provided. It's a plug-and-play device with a user-friendly interface, making it suitable even for those who are not tech-savvy. The Type-C port is a modern touch, ensuring fast data transfer and charging.I would definitely recommend the Otovoda 4K Dash Cam to anyone looking for a high-quality, reliable dash camera system. It's a worthwhile investment for both everyday drives and longer road trips.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a gift for my mom since she doesn't have a dash cam. I thought this would be a good candidate since it has 4k resolution and a lot of great features. Also, it was on sale and the price is hard to beat!Pros:- 4k resolution for the front camera and even 1080 for the rear camera!- Great pictures and video quality. I'm not concerned about being able to catch detailed information in the case of an accident.- Also has an app for both Apple and Android that easily connects to your phone via wifi and allows for smooth operation of the dash cam as well as being able to download and save the files you need.- Typical camera features such as G-sensor, lock recordings, loop recording, and even comes with its own 64 gb memory card. The slot allows for up to 256 gb.- Huge 170 degree front camera angle lets you catch a very wide spectrum.- Comes with a rear camera as well to catch anything hitting you from behind.- Simple to use and setup is a breeze.Cons:- NoneOverall, if you're looking for a great little dash cam to put your mind at ease while you drive, I'd recommend getting this one. For the price, it's a great deal. You get all the features of a high-end dash cam, but at a much more affordable price.",

This camera was easy to install and has an amazing picture. the frame rate keeps up with real time as you are driving. the reverse cam can be installed on the outside of the vehicle with an option to attach the wire to your reverse system, so it activates when placed in reverse. also has a park aid feature when installed this way. I installed it on the inside of the vehicle for my own convenience. I have boughten cheaper cameras in the past and have got what I paid for. many problems. so far, no problems with this camera and so easy to install. It came with everything you will need. and the included Micro SD card was an added bonus. nice touch. I highly recommend this camera. great picture and picture in picture when recording. up to 5-minute loop feature with overwrite capabilities to save space on the SD card. BUY THIS CAMERA if you are in need of a good camera. it has many features such a G-sensor and motion detection. and many more.",

                "reviewText": "I had a dash cam several years ago and it was not good so was hesitant to get another. However, this little dash cam is really great and works good for me. I do believe all the things said from all the good reviews. It's clear day or night, always works, records front and rear views separately, easy to setup, easy to install, and the Viidure app seems to work fine to access camera and when using wi-fi.I installed the front camera kinda behind the rear view mirror so when driving, it's just not blocking any view. I don't really look at it when I'm driving anyway.Instead of installing the rear camera above the license plate, I installed inside at top of rear window - seems to work fine as long as the window is kept clear of snow. I did not connect the rear camera to use as a backup camera so don't know how that works.But nothing is perfect - I found the 3M stickers to hold the cables were not very sticky and did not hold but I then used 2-sided carpet tape and that works ; I like all the features including the mic but would like to turn the mic on or off by pressing a button instead of having to go into the menu ; I currently cannot delete nor unlock the locked videos but have contacted customer service (maybe I will need to format SD card, don't know yet). I consider these all to be minor.I think the price is good when discounted and would buy again, maybe for the wife's car. Based on other cameras, I think the price, functionality, features, and options, are certainly worth it.",

I am currently in search of a dash cam on the Amazon.ca website that offers 4K image resolution, a complimentary SD card, and the capability to connect to a smartphone via WiFi. I believe 4K resolution is essential, as high-resolution images can be incredibly helpful in the event of an accident. This product meets my requirements well, and although there are numerous dash cams on Amazon, I found this one to be suitable within my budget.The installation of the dash cam was straightforward and only took a couple of minutes. The recorded images are exceptionally clear. I drive approximately 60 km each day, using a 4GB SD card, so a 64GB card should last around 10 days without overwriting. In reality, there's rarely a need to review driving history from ten days prior.My car starts with CarPlay, which automatically connects to my iPhone, preventing a simultaneous WiFi connection with the dash cam. However, this isn't an issue for me since I prefer to download videos to my laptop. I discovered that Windows 11 can't open MP4 videos by default due to licensing issues; you need to download free software like VLC Media Player to access MP4 files. Additionally, a cellphone may not have enough storage for a 64GB video if you wish to preserve your holiday travel history.I am delighted to have found a charger power cord with a USB port, allowing me to use other devices (although my car has a USB port, I use it for listening to music). I highly recommend this product; it's an excellent choice.",
