A1: Regarding the question you mentioned, because there are many fake cards on the market and problems related to card compatibility, we cannot ensure that all 128GB cards can be used. What we can be sure of is that 32GB is definitely applicable. If you want to try a 128GB MicroSD card, please format it to FAT32 or EXFAT or other format on the Computer first, and then format it again on the Camera before use. (Please don't click Quick Format when formatting the SD card on the computer.) Q2: Will the dash cam turn on/off automatically when I turn on/off my car engine? A2: Yes. If not, please check and make sure the connection between the power ports and cables are tight or reach out iZEEKER for help. Q3. Should the dash cam always be on charging to keep recording during my driving? A3: Just like all dash cams on the market , this dash camera is built-in battery, the battery capacity is small. As a dash cam, it is used with power supply all the time during driving. Large battery will cause the security affairs like battery explosion. If you prefer the long time monitoring during parking, we suggest to use a hard wire kit for power supply. Q4. What if my card cannot work on the dash cam and creating damaged files? A4: If your card cannot not work on the dash camera, please get a good and new class 10 or higher speed 32GB MicroSD card or reach out to iZEEKER to get a free 32GB Micro SD card. Q5. What if my car doesn't have a cigarette lighter? A5: As all car chargers that come with dashcams need to be plugged into car cigarette lighters, if your car does not have a cigarette lighter, please get a USB power cable without any cost from iZEEKER official. Also, please kindly note that due to long-term transportation, the built-in battery of the dash cam may be exhausted during the process. Therefore, after receiving the dash cam, please charge it for about 15 minutes before using it. Note:Please submit queries and discussions about the product itself in the Customer Questions and Answers section. Suggestions and sharing related to the use of the product are also encouraged and valued.",

After around 3-4 months, I ended up witnessing and recording an accident (which I retrieved and sent in as evidence), and all I had to do was plug in the dash cam using the same cord to my computer. I accidentally took off the suction cup not realizing the camera can slide off the suction cup holder, but it stuck back on great and hasn\u2019t fallen off! The photo attached shows what the camera quality looks like at night when parked. It\u2019s not perfect, but good enough to make out any important details. If you\u2019re looking for a cheap dash cam, definitely recommend!",

The new one is working so far after about 4 days of use. We will see how this one fares.Was:I bought this camera a while ago but only started using it about 2 months ago. It worked fine for about six weeks. But now it no longer records. It tries, but it repeatedly switches between record and stopped mode every 3 seconds or so, writing 31.5MB files every time it switches. The files have no video content in them. The menus are very slow to respond.I reset it using the reset button as well as reset to the default settings. The menus were fast for about 10 seconds after that, then back to the old, broken behavior.I tried to visit the iZEEKER website for support but it is non-responsive.I guess I'm out of luck. I would look elsewhere.",

I purchased this product for the 2-year warranty and especially the free USB cable they claim to provide if needed (my car doesn't have a cigarette lighter).I learned the hard way, this only applies to sales made directly from the iZeeker Store. Purchases from the Amazon Warehouse and third party resellers have NO 2-year warranty, NO free replacement parts, and NO USB power cable upon request.Again, it's a great camera for the money, but if you need the USB power cable be absolutely sure you are purchasing directly from iZeeker. Do not follow the \"Buy New & Used from...\", nor the \"Other Amazon Sellers\" links unless you don't need the USB cable nor want a 2-year warranty.I have followed the \"report an issue or error on this page\" link and asked that the warranty and parts replacement text be edited to clearly state it does not apply to iZekker products sold by Amazon Warehouse nor any other \"third parties.\"I have been in contact with iZeeker and Amazon. My only recourse is to return the camera to the seller (Amazon Warehouse). All I wanted was the advertised USB cable so I could enjoy the camera. \u2026Hoping this helps other buyers. \u2026",

Which i like. i want to be 100% i am recording. NOW- my problem is AMAZON. because AMAZON in the description says it has this option.

So now it's October and I can say it's one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon. And really everyone should have one in their car. And for the price it's within anyone's budget. Thank God I havent had any accidents but I've captured a lot of near misses. I live in Jersey and people drive crazy in this state. And should I ever have an accident, I'm confident this camera with document what happened. I had an issue with the memory card I was using and contacted the seller who was very nice and sent me a replacement at no cost - and it was a good one - SanDisk... I actually bought this camera over others based on the good reviews that mentioned the excellent customer service. Cassie from Izeeker answered my emails promptly and was very nice \ud83d\udc4dAll in all I haven't had any issues with the camera. People complaining about the suction cup - if you clean the window well with alcohol it should hold well. I been through cold weather and a hot summer and it never came down even once. I haven't had any issues with the card reformatting that I seen a few people mention and the video quality is good and reliable.Hope this review helps!",

But it does work, it records well, and it's easy to install. So like a 1/10 for video quality, and so far a 10/10 for 'does it work'.",
