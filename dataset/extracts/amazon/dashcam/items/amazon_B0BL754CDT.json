I got this to hardwire a mirror dashcam, and those have the USB-C input power connector on the top side, if the mirror has very little clearance from the top side to the ceiling of the car, you simply cannot connect that super-long connector. I ordered a 45-degree USB-C adapter here on amazon to see if using that, I can have enough clearance to position the mirror dashcam in place while being able to connect it. but if I can't, then I have to undo the whole hardwiring and return everything.If you're planing on using this for a regular dashcam and you don't mind having the long connector sticking out on the side of your camera, then this is just fine, but if not. just use something else.",

                "reviewText": "Works perfectly. Installed in a 2014 Ford Taurus for a Wolfbox i07 dash cam. The hardest part was figuring out which of the car's fuses were switched and which are always on. My fuse box is very crowded, but since the wire comes straight off the top of the included fuse adapter, this wasn't an issue. I did have to peel away some of the outer insulation at the fuse box end because the amount of exposed ground wire wasn't long enough to reach a chassis ground point, so I deducted a star for that. Also, the car's fuse box cover doesn't fit back on tightly anymore, but I don't mind since most fuse boxes don't even have a cover. I tucked the wire in under the headliner above the windshield, in behind the A pillar, then behind the driver's door weather stripping until it was low enough to roll the extra up and tuck it all out of sight under the dash near the driver's knee. Nice tidy installation, and works perfect. Now the camera powers on when I start the car, and goes In to parking mode when the ignition is off. This isn't possible using a 12v accessory outlet. All in all very satisfied, especially for the ~CAD$17 it cost.",

                "reviewText": "the fuse ends are not fuse add-a-fuse taps but rather just fused leads which would plug directly into a fuse panel. These will not work when you intend to \"tap\" into an existing fuse circuit, but are designed to replace, not share, an existing fuse position. Add-a-fuse taps are already wired so the ends on this unit will need to be cut off and spliced to this wire. And the built in fuse can not be used for an add-a-fuse set up as this fuse is built into the end socket. So you will need a fuse along with an add a fuse kit.",
