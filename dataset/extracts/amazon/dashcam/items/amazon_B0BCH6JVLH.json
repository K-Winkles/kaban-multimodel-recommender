                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a good little entry level dash cam for cars. I say entry level because it does not have night vision or inside the car recording for the inside portion of the car. It only records outside from the windshield and the rear camera records from the rear outside only and there's no recording for the inside car cabin. Unless you turn the camera around, which is point less because in the dark it does not show anything. The resolution of this camera is pretty good, It records at 2.5K. The built in GPS records the speed limit which is imprinted on the video file along with date time-stamped on the video file. The app can be confusing at first, but the manual explains everything clearly. The rear camera is made of plastic which feels very cheap and clumsy. The front camera has some good weight to it so it feels a bit durable. The length of the wire is pretty good, especially the rear camera, it can be Installed in small cars or SUV's easily. The wire gets connected to a USB port, but If you don't have a USB port, then this camp comes with a cigarette lighter plug that you can plug in the cigarette lighter port. The entire navigation and setting is done through the app on the phone. the camera does not have LCD screen or any buttons, basically every thing is controlled through the app and the app name is DDPAI.",

                "reviewText": "So far so good. I've tried out several in the past and never loved one - so far this is my favorite for a few reasons* Came with long enough wiring to run back camera to the front of my Nissan Xterra SUV with no issue - there was spare wire I ended up tucking behind the A Pillar.* \"Always On\" parking mode which can be turned on or off, and if on has different time out options if you're worried about battery life. In this mode it take snapshots to make a timelapse so you don't get full recording which would kill your battery but you get some insight into what and who was around if a parking lot ding happens. Note that your USB source will need constant power for this to work* multiple levels of sensitivity for the G Sensor \"emergency\" video save. Normally this is useful if you get hit, bumped or some other jolting action occurs - it automatically saves the video. THe initial setting was too sensitive and crossing highway reflectors would trigger it but I was able to turn it down to only register heavier jolts.* Picture is good. Not the best, but good at this price point*App is decent - not great but gives access to the settings you need, and can also preview videos easily by day and session, then choosing to download any that you want.",
