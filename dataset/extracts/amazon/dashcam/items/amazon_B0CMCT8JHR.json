This one has a wide angle feature, where it captures some of the areas that you don\u2019t usually see in a typical dash cam setting. This is an important safety feature, as you want to make sure you get every shot possible.Setting up took no more than 15 minutes. I was able to follow through with the instructions with no problem. The suction on the dash cam, that allows it to be uphold on the windshield is such a life saver. I\u2019ve gone through speed bumps and potholes, and the dash cam has not fallen out.The quality was super clear and not pixelated. When I turn my car on, it automatically turns on and begins recording already.One key feature is how compact yet large the screen is on the dash cam, making it super visible to see every part of the camera.",
