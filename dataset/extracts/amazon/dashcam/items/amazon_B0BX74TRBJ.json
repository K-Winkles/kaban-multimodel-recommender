                "reviewText": "This is the first dashcam I have tried and was excited to see how well it worked. Unfortunately after installing in my vehicle, I immediately got an SD card error message. I attempted removing, inspecting and reinstalling it but this was unsuccessful, so I purchased a comparable better quality card thinking this would fix the issue but it did not, I get the same error message. Aside from it not working, I wasn't crazy about the mounting option as you only get an adhesive backed clip that you slide the camera into. I would also like to see it have the option to hard wire it rather than use the 12v plug. I found the rear facing camera wire fitment to not be the best and adds an unattractive look. I like the screen and found toggling the options to be ok but not the best. I like the option to have a sensor that would record when the car is parked but that requires an add on. I don't like giving bad reviews but I cans only share what I experienced. I would spend the extra money for a better camera.",
