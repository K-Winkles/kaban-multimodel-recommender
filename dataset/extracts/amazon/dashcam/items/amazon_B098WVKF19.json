                "reviewText": "I have purchased 2 dashboard cameras from REDTIGER. First in April 2021, and the second in April 2023. Unfortunately, the second camera failed after just 3 months. It begin to reboot at random time, making all sorts of noses.NOTE: the original review as negative (I give REDTIGER only one star). I decided to change this review from negative to POSITIVE after resolving the problem with the REDTIGER customer support.If you have a problem with REDTIGER's Dashboard camera, I highly encourage you to contact REDTIGER and work with them!From the moment I reached out to the REDTIGER customer service team, I was met with a level of professionalism and attentiveness that is increasingly rare in today's fast-paced world. The representatives were not only knowledgeable about their product but also genuinely committed to ensuring a smooth and satisfying customer experience. They patiently addressed all my inquiries, providing detailed information and guidance that went above and beyond my expectations.Now, let's talk about the star of the show\u2014the new dashboard camera F7N. The device boasts cutting-edge technology that sets it apart from the competition. The video quality is nothing short of exceptional, capturing crystal-clear footage both during the day and at night. The wide-angle lens ensures a comprehensive view of the surroundings, leaving no room for blind spots.What truly impressed me was the camera's advanced features (touch screen) and user-friendly interface.One standout feature is the intelligent parking mode, which automatically activates the camera when motion is detected, providing an added layer of security for my vehicle. The device's reliability and robust construction instill confidence, and its sleek design adds a touch of modernity to my car's interior.In conclusion, the exceptional customer service combined with the top-tier performance of this dashboard camera has left me thoroughly impressed.

This camera has consistently impressed me with its high-quality performance. The clarity of both its standard imaging and night vision capabilities stands out, providing crisp and clear visuals regardless of the lighting conditions.It is quite easy to install, and you just forget about it while it does its job, then it is there when you truly need it. Reviewing the footage is very friendly, either through the camera, the SD reader or on the phone through the app. They upgraded their app not too long ago and it is very nice to use and work like a charm.The customer service provided by REDTIGER is deserving of special commendation. Their support team truly shines. I encountered some issues when using large capacity SD cards with the camera. I teached out to them via email, I was met with prompt and attentive responses through every email exchange until my issue was resolved. Their dedication to customer satisfaction is genuinely commendable.All in all, this is a great buy and then some, and I am very satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this for my wife's RAV4. I like having both the front and rear cameras and love how compact they are; they are fairly unobtrusive in both locations. The front camera is mostly behind the rear-view mirror (the camera is small enough to easily fit entirely behind the mirror, but the car's OEM black box against the windshield is already occupying the ideal real estate). The rear camera is tucked up at the top of the rear window (just at the top of the rear wiper sweep area) and is barely noticeable. I liked that I could rotate the rear camera in its holder to the view angle I wanted. The cable length on the rear camera was more than sufficient to reach front-to-back in this car (and easily tucked away behind the headliner and other trim pieces), but I'm not sure if it would be enough for a full-size SUV like an Excursion. It does have an inline connector near the rear camera which was convenient when installing the rear camera and running the wire and may allow for an extension to be used.The video quality looks great. I set my front resolution down to 1080p since I feel that will be sufficient for our day-to-day needs. In my opinion, the quality of the footage will be impacted more by how clean the glass is and the weather conditions outside than the quality of the cameras.I like that I can set whether and how long the screen is visible when the dashcam is on. Most of the time, I prefer to have the displays screen off. It takes some clicking to get through all of the menus, but I found the UI intuitive and easy enough to use.The included lighter adaptor worked fine, but I got the hardwire kit (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WCTZ3Y8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) to run permanently and to enable Parking Mode (see note below).I also got the 3M Mount (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SFY13TZ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) so I could mount the camera a bit higher behind the rear-view mirror. I'll use the suction mount and lighter adaptor when using the dashcam on trips in a rental car.You'll want to get a larger (e.g. 256 GB) High Endurance U3 SD card (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P4HBRMV?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) as the included SD card is only U1.NOTE on the hardwire kit and Parking Mode: I connected the wires as instructed (yellow->BATT, red->ACC, black->GRD) but did not see the behavior I was expecting from the dashcam: the dashcam immediately turned on even though the ACC power was off, and I could not turn on Parking Mode. This led me to believe that the documentation was wrong, so I reversed the red and yellow wires which resulted in the dashcam not turning on until ACC power was on and allowing me to set Parking Mode (or so I thought), so I felt that I had figured it out. However, I then realized that the dashcam would not stay on - it never recorded any footage while the car was on (or off). Gratefully, I found a Q&A response from \"Elizabeth B\" back on 10/7/2021 which explained how to properly set up Parking Mode (which doesn't appear to be documented anywhere with either product):1. Connect wires as described above (Yellow = constant 12v, Red = switched 12v, Black = ground).2. Turn on acc power (but do not start engine).3. Press menu button and select \"Parking\".4. While blue message box is shown on the F7N display, turn off acc power (this has to be timed well). You should see a new blue message box and the F7N unit will power off.5. Turn acc power back on (but do not start engine).6. Press menu button and select \"Parking\".7. You will now see the menu options for Parking Mode and be able to configure it how you like.credit: Elizabeth B.(Attention REDTIGER: You should include these steps in your documentation and compensate Elizabeth.)After reverting my wire connections back to match the documentation and following the steps above, my hardwired dashcam is now functioning perfectly - including Parking Mode.Even though my installation and set-up experience with the hardwire kit wasn't ideal, I do have to say that the REDTIGER customer service was outstanding! They were responsive, proactive, and empowered to do the right things for their customers. Thank you Nora!As for the apps, the Android app seems to work sufficiently well. It does take a LONG time to download the video files over the dashcam's wi-fi. I prefer to remove the SD card and copy the files directly to my PC.I'm not very impressed with the PC app (Windows 10) yet. I tried it only once, but it seemed to have a hard time after viewing the first video, and even that wasn't great. It's intended to show both front & rear video simultaneously, which I think is great, but I haven't been able to get it work very well. I'll try again and see if I can get it run better. I was surprised to discover that the rear camera records audio, so it doesn't sound great when both front and rear audio are played at the same time. I muted the rear audio and used just the front audio.The video files run just fine on third-part video players.Bottom line: I love the dashcam and rear camera; easy to use; good video; absolutely fabulous customer service.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this cam sometime in July. I was having troubles with the suction cup in high and low temps so I bought the adhesive one. I haven\u2019t had any issues with it coming off.The picture is better than low quality cams and for the price, it is good. You should have no issues seeing the license plates of cars beside you when it\u2019s light out. The night vision should allow you to clearly see the license plate of a vehicle in front of you. There was no issues with setting it up and mounting it to my car. I haven\u2019t done the rear facing cam yet though.Since I haven\u2019t used the suction cup in a while, I lost it and I needed to use it for my work van. I can\u2019t put an adhesive mount on since the vehicle isn\u2019t mine. When I first messaged customer service asking them to help me, I was fully expecting to pay for it and shipping if that was even possible since they don\u2019t ship to Canada and Amazon.ca doesn\u2019t sell a replacement mount. I never imagined this would be solved so quickly, but least of all that I\u2019d get it for free just because I lost the other one. Thank you so much Crystal. You did an amazing job helping me and you really deserve a raise!",

                "reviewText": "This camera is amazing... I was going to say amazing for the price, but I'll just say it's generally pretty regardless of price point. The video quality is fantastic and high resolution, with audio recording included as well as that could be useful in some circumstances. It was very easy to install, but that will of course vary by car depending on if you have somewhere throughout the car where the cables can be hidden, and the cables are a great length... I have quite a big car and had a lot of cable left over, so don't worry at all if that is your concern.The accompanying software to view your clips is also great and you can search by date, time and location as the cameras clip on mount contains a GPS like device, so you can see were you were on the map depending on what clip you were playing. It's super easy to take off the amount and retrieve the footage if you need to do so.This camera has already saved me from a not fault claim, as well as prove in fault claim that the actions/damaged I caused were in no way as they claimed (they tried bundling existing damaged on the claim to avoid having to pay for it themselves). However due to the great video quality during the day and night, the insurance took their claims forward to be fraudulent. Would 100% recommend!!!!",

Und wenn was ist,ich denke der Support ist einsame Spitze und wird das schon regeln.",
