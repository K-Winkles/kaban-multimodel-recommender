Why there is even a need to have different USB-C kits for one camera manufacturer?Edit:Seller contacted me and explained why there are different hardware kits and fully refunded the cost of an incompatible hardware kit as well as a partial refund for a dashcam itself. Just based on that I'd say the seller was a pleasure to deal with and stands behind their product and fully committed to make customers happy, 5 stars from me. Dashcam itself works perfect and produces great videos, would buy from this seller again in a heartbeat. Just watch folks and don't repeat my mistake, order a proper kit for the dashcam you're buying.",

                "reviewText": "I spent so much time looking for the best hardwire kit only to find out accidentally that RedTiger provides these as well. It\u2019s logical that if the price is right, you can\u2019t go wrong with getting a full setup from the same company. As the RedTiger cameras have been serving me for years I was confident in my choice.For all people installing hardwire kit for the first time. Yes, it might be confusing at first but after being quoted almost \u00a3200 for 5 minutes job (from professional perspective) I decided to do it myself. To be honest the kit comes with the plastic wedge and installation quide which is quite clear and self explanatory.Going back to the kit itself, the product is very nice and feels reliable. The length of the cables is standard/sufficient to go inside the cabin from the fuse box around the front window. Also it already comes with car fuses, so if you know what you are doing then you can\u2019t go wrong with it. In my situation I simply went to Halfords and purchased extra 2x 10A fuses (this was specific for my car, but it may not be for yours) just in case. After I figured out which fuses are ACC (power only when engine is on) and which one are BATTERY (constant power), things got simple (it is important to understand which side is + and which one is -).Going back to the main subject, the installation went smoothly and the setup has been operational for days without a hiccup. Also stay reassured that the device has low voltage protection, so it won\u2019t drain your battery flat. If that doesn\u2019t convince you, then I don\u2019t know what.Highly recommended.PS: In case of any problems, you can always message their support. They are not available 24/7 but they always respond.",
