The full rear display is 1.5 times larger than an ordinary rearview mirror, which has significantly reduced rearview blind spots.",
            "12'' LARGER SCREEN & BROAD VIEW - Upgraded from most rearview mirror cameras, WOLFBOX 170\u00b0 front, and 140\u00b0 rear lens provide an ultra-wide view, minimizing the blind spots for safe driving/reversing. With the smart screen split function, you can observe a dual-lens display simultaneously. With a 2.5D curved screen, the body is more smooth and more suitable for the curvature of the human retina. Its OEM looking makes the mirror camera perfectly integrate with the existing mirror.",
            "CLEAR IMAGE & ENHANCED NIGHT VISION - With a built-in high-quality chip, the WOLFBOX mirror camera records 4K front and 1080P rear videos. The mirror dash camera applied an upgraded low-reflectivity LCD to reduce reflection during the day. With incorporated WDR&HDR tech balancing the lights, and the help of a starvis sensor and 6-glass lens to capture higher quality images, driving at night or in any challenging lighting situations should be more effortless.",
            "GPS TRACKING ALL THE TIME - With the external GPS antenna plugged in, you can view the GPS info on display while on the wheel. Playback recorded videos on GPS Player, not only can you check the double channel videos on one screen, but also accurately trace back all the GPS metrics.",
            "24H PRECISE PARKING MONITOR - Aside from loop recording for safe driving, your car will still be in safe hands after being parked. The time-lapse mode is there to monitor at very low fps which saves power and capacity while having everything recorded.",
            "NEW UPGRADE, USB C POWER SUPPLY - To make the use process more stable, the G840S Mirror Camera has been fully upgraded from Mini-USB to a USB C socket, which can largely avoid restarting, high-temperature deformation, and so on. (if you need a hardwire kit, please buy a dedicated USB C hardwire kit. Asin: B09X1L1GMX)",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great dash cam/smart rear-view mirror for the price",
                "reviewText": "TLDR: Your satisfaction with this item will depend on your need. If you want a all in one device - dash cam/rear camera/backup camera/GPS Speedometer/compass and the occasional rear camera view because your view is blocked - this is a must buy. But if you're planning on using this in rear camera mode all the time - this may not be the product for you.I was surfing YouTube one day and came across a video of a Smart Rear View Mirror and was intrigued. I have a midsize SUV and with the cargo area full of boxes, balloons or people, I can't see out of the rear view mirror. I always wanted a rear view camera as well and this crossed off a lot of my needs. We've come a long way when a touch screen product like this with all these features is a little over a hundred dollars. I went with the 12\" because I saw how the 10\" rear view mirrors had to extend the camera out so your original mirror doesn't block it. So it ends up being 12\" anyway and doesn't look as clean. But I made sure I measured everything and that my sun visor wouldn't block it before getting the 12\". After two weeks with the mirror, here is my list of Pros and Cons:Pros:-Quick install. I mounted the rear camera with the double sided tape to the glass of my SUV tailgate. That way it doesn't get dirty or wet. The higher position also reduces the camera being blinded by headlights straight on at night as opposed to it being mounted by your license plate.-At night, I find the screen at the lowest brightness works well. It's no brighter than the cars infotainment screen.-The large screen makes navigating and watching recordings easy. The UI was surprisingly easy to navigate.-Comes with a 32GB Mini SD Card so you're ready to go at the start. But I highly recommend getting a 64GB card, anything higher might cause issues.-One of the reviews said you couldn't set the screen to display mph or 12 hour time. I was able to set both, either they fixed it via a firmware update and the new ones are updated or some people are just not tech savvy.-My SUV already had a OEM crappy backup camera, so I didn't spend time tapping into the reverse light.-There isn't a app to wireless transfer the recordings. So you have to plug the miniSD card into a computer. -Navigating the folders to the files are pretty intuitive. But if you need to have both the front and rear recordings playing at the same time, you'll need to download their GV Player. Which I will add as a Con below.-Excellent and responsive customer service. Just make sure you email service.wolfbox@gmail.com and not what's listed in the manual.Cons:-Firmware. No mention anywhere how to update the firmware. I'll reach out to support to add me to the email list when new firmware is available.-Speed warning setting. Can't change it from kph to mph, but a firmware update in the future could fix this. Not that big of a deal, since you will only have to set this once.-No automatic brightness adjustments. In modern cars when the headlights come on, the tachometer and infotainment would dim accordingly. But I can see how this could be a liability as well.-I use this as a normal mirror, but with the time/date and GPS overlay on it. I have noticed the glare issue others have noted - especially when it's overcast (even with all my windows tinted -except the front). But since I'm not using the rear camera live video feed 100% of the time, it doesn't bother me. I was more interested in the rear dash cam ability.-I wish there was a saturation/hue and contrast setting, maybe in a future firmware update.-The GV Player has a little bit of a learning curve, especially when there is no manual. The user interface is also dated. I also couldn't figure out how to get the GPS portion working in the software.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this a few weeks back and installed in My 2019 Jeep Wrangler, I primarily installed for when I have the top and door offs to supplement the small side mirror I have. This thing works great, I had no problem installing, I used the rear accessory plug in for power and switched the fuse to be on only with the ignition so as to not run the batteries down as some other reviews indicate may happen.I was able to run the wires through some of the existing holes for the rear to the front with plenty of cord leftover. I mounted the rear camera internally using some 3m double sided tape and attached to the interior light pointing towards the rear of the vehicle. With this in place and the top off I can see the blind spot on both sides of the car with ease, I have also used this with the top on and the camera us flawless in that application as well, it gives a good view through the rear window. I have not had issues with the camera being flooded out with headlights and it is able to get through rain drops on the rear window as well. The view in the daytime under direct sunlight is acceptable- I have yet to see it drowned out and that may be solely due to where I mounted it.I tried the \"gps\" unit and it does not offer any real advantage and seems spotty at best, from what I can tell it gives you direction and time and speed and the cord for that was super long as well.The Jeep already has a backup cam so I do not use that feature either.The unit does record and you can view the videos on the mirror or take the memory card out and view on a mac or pc, it does seem very sensitive as far as bumps and things go and it going into recording mode but I am good with that and there have been a couple of incidents already that had something happened I would have had a recording of the event.The touch screen is sensitive and I did find it hard to scroll through the features, but it was not a deal breaker, you can easily switch from from to back to front to dual view with ease, though I keep it on rear view at all times. Thus far it has started up flawlessly when I start the engine, boot up time is about 10 seconds.Overall 4 stars for this, at the price point it is a great product",

Rear camera takes a bit of work to feed it through and mount it in the rear, in some cases you need to drill a hole for wire access (make sure you don\u2019t leave the metal bare, use rustoleum or something. The trickiest part of install is tapping the reverse light (optional), you\u2019ll need a wire tap, and it\u2019s not included.The cameras at night have a bit of glare from headlights, particularly the rear one, other than that it\u2019s great quality video. You\u2019ll probably want a larger memory card but that\u2019s optional.",

                "reviewText": "** Updated**Ok, so I bought this based on the reviews.I originally gave it 3 stars, but upgraded it to 4 then 5, because of interactions with their service team, whom are very keen on making things right. I upgraded it again to 5 because their solutions and actions were great.So, now that I have this all installed, I went out in the deep darkness for a test.I thought that it works pretty good, but let me get into the details.Cameras:I found the original rear camera had a rather grainy image in the dark, but useable, I suppose I was expecting it to be a bit more of an eye into darkness than it turned out.Am I disappointed?; well no not really, maybe some\u2026 but I did think it should be a bit better than it is.Graininess shouldn\u2019t be affected even considering it was installed inside the rear hatch window. The forward image is great and it\u2019s behind a window\u2026So The next day it was sunny and I went for another drive. So now i find some new issues:When driving with the sun out, looking at the rear image, there is a lot of problem with reflections. I am guessing it\u2019s because it\u2019s mounted on the inside, oh well, for now that will have to do until I can figure out how to mount it outside in such a place that is useful, I may try adding a small black cardboard sun shade over the lens to see if that helps.I don\u2019t really want to mount it outside And offset from the hatch handle (the handle is right in the center) for several reasons, first being that I don\u2019t want it staring straight into the guy behind me\u2019s headlights and second I don\u2019t want some punks walking by and seeing it dangling there and decide to damage it, rip it off or diddle with it. So inside it stays for now.** Update **Wolfbox customer service got in touch with me after they read my review and offered to ship me a new better model rear camera, it came very fast and now that it\u2019s installed, i can say i like the rear image much better. Much less grainy.Front camera:I find the clarity and overall look and brightness are really great.Software:So when using the setup, I found a problem that bothers me. If you are dealing with the reflections and want to turn off the screen, and use it like a regular mirror, it stops recording if you are in the brightness mode.If you put it on \u201cscreen off mode\u201d, that issue is avoided, because it turns off the screen and keeps recording after it stays lit for 30sec, so ok\u2026 but it would be nicer to have an onscreen button that you could do that with because now if i\u2019m driving at night and want it on, you have to go into settings and monkey around to get it back to being on all the time\u2026 grrrr And then of course the screen is really dark in mirror only mode which is very sad. The manuals descriptions of the modes is poor.** Update **Tech support said that \u201cquick\u201d touching the power button will also turn it off but allow for continuous recording in mirror only mode. Ok, that helps!I love the touch screen, and the software is clean and easy to use minus the issues I mentioned with the screen off options.I love how i only have to touch the screen like an iPad to move the image angle up or down.Also, the file system seems very weird. After reviewing the files on my computer it seems that I can see all the files as expected, you can only review forward files while on the mirror, I can\u2019t see any files for the rear camera on the mirror, only on the computer\u2026 not a deal breaker at all.Device body and design:Another issue I have is the very poor \u201cthought\u201d design of the cables where they connect to the unit\u2026 3 different shapes and angles, you would think they would design it in such a way that they would all face the same direction and sit nicely side by side instead of all hap hazard\u2026 see pics. (i\u2019ll get a better pic soon)It would be nice if the PCB had the memory card to one side or the other rather than in-between the rear cam and gps wire connections. But not a deal breaker.GPS and LDWSI tried the gps gizmo and took it out - absolutely useless and distracting.Supplied cables and lengths.I have a 2013 grand caravan and I found the rear camera extension wire was \u201cjust\u201d long enough, if i have to mount it down near the license plate it might not make it unless i routed it as a straight shot through the head liner rather than around the perimeter under the edges.Also, The front power wire is just barely long enough and i mean barely it would be nice to see it 6 inches or more longer.I originally bought a 10inch unit - and \u201cthat\u201d was too small just incase you\u2019re trying to figure out which one you need.Security Features:There is a consideration to make when you buy one of these you may need to know.It has to do with the leaving the camera on 24/7 on a non keyed 12v outlet, I tested the unit after i installed it and it is drawing about 0.3amps, so if you have a 45 or so amp hour battery, the battery will be dead or unable to start the car in about 3 to 6 days, so if you don\u2019t drive everyday - so as to recharge the battery, you might want to not bother with the security cam feature.If you do, you should get the adapter kit that is suppose to prevent drawing the battery out completely, but again, if you don\u2019t drive it everyday, that kit will only just cut off the battery so it doesn\u2019t kill it, and you\u2019ll still be not recording after maybe 4 - 6 days.However! - just to be clear, all this draining on a 24/7 recording program, is going to hurt your battery long term, because draining a flooded lead acid battery to 75% every 3 - 6 days is not good for it.You might want to get a heated LifepO4 lithium or at least an AGM battery rather than a basic lead acid flooded battery. But I am ranting here\u2026 this not the fault of the dash cam\u2026 you could buy your battery at costco and just replace it under warranty in 3 years if it gets weak.Or, maybe getting a small dedicated additional battery that you hide somewhere for the camera to draw from, which your alternator charges maybe with an isolator switch to have while your driving, just saying.That of course will likely have to be professionally installed to be useful. I just wouldn\u2019t bother.I am just going to use it in my keyed 12v outlet thanks, and for that it seems so far to be great. I find if i need security recording - i just switch the prong to my non keyed outlet for as long as i need it then i put it back.**Update**I received some info from tech support concerning the recording in off keyed mode, apparently they say that there is circuitry embedded that prevents it draining the battery past 12v. I knew I wasn\u2019t going anywhere over the holidays, So I put the adapter into my non keyed outlet and after 3 days my battery was stone dead at 8.4v - yup had to get a jump to start it.So I will leave it in the keyed adapter from now on, but regardless I still don\u2019t like the idea of leaving any sort of parasitic device eating away at my battery even if I am charging it every day.I know many of you are not electrically savvy and think that there is nothing to consider when making changes to your systems, that all is rosy and possible.As I said; if you do use it in non keyed mode or with it running straight off the battery AND you tend to not drive everyday, you should have something other than a lead acid battery installed, and the additional kit that protects the battery because LONGTERM your going to shorten your batteries life and unless you drive everyday, you are going to drain out.So overall - you can\u2019t go wrong buying this unit! Support is great, and the product is well thought out for the most part. I may be a bit weird about protecting batteries, but that\u2019s me. If you\u2019re looking for a good dashcam mirror, this one is worth getting in my opinion.my 2cents",

Bei der Standard rudknkamera st\u00f6rte mich die etwas zu dunkle Ansicht, daher lieber die qualitativ bessere WDR Kamera Ordern.Mir gefiel auch der Support den ich durch durch wolfbox erhielt. Freundlich, L\u00f6sungsorientiert und schnell im umsetzen.

                "reviewTitle": "2 Reviews in one - G840H and G840S",
                "reviewText": "There are two reviews here. G840S & G840H===============================================================Review for G840S:Although initially I though the device is quite bulky, after installation and setup I quickly changed my mind. I had doubts that the device will 'fit' my mirror but once again I was wrong. Just after few seconds of moving it around it fit perfectly and I was stunned how securely it holds.Installation: one important thing to remember is that the camera is on one side of the device as such the device itself will slide more to one of the sides of your mirror. Initially I thought that this will bring the 'picture' too close to my face, but actually it feels very natural and comfortable.Video: I have different 4k camera in another vehicle and after few days of driving and comparing the quality it is hard distinguish the difference. Needless to say, I spent a lot of time doing my research before the purchase, so when this one landed on my lap I was surprised with this shot in the dark.Box: the box comes with a number of gadgets that you can but don't have to use.1) Beside the camera itself and the mounts, you can use the GPS device. This is not compulsory, but if you want the GPS/speedometer info, it\u2019s a must. The add on is very small, consequently you can conveniently install it behind the mirror. From driver's perspective you won't see it at all and it won't impact your vision.2) The other device is the reverse camera that captures picture in the industry standard (for reverse cameras) of 1080p. Initially I thought that the 140 angle on reverse camera (170 front) is insufficient but after driving a few days, I can confirm it's perfect. After reviewing videos I have no problems reading number plates, so in the case of unfortunate accident, you can stay assured, the evidence will be there.3) Cloth, nice bonus for cleaning the camera or device itself4) Plastic wedge to feed and hide the cable during installation5) Few cable holders (there are doing just fine during hot day). Also they can be used multiple times so if you decide to swap the cable (during hardwire installation) this can be done easily. Before installing one or few make sure you are confident if your choice as they hold very well.6) Power adapter7) InstructionsBuild quality: The device feels nice in hand. You get the premium feeling and after opening the box, I almost felt like it's Christmas.Pros: Material, Quality, Ease of installationCons: this one is difficult. NONE in short, but if I was to try and find one thing I don't like, well... not for me but the reverse camera cannot be mounted directly on the window. I know there are people who would prefer do it. Consequently its a matter of preference I guess. Would be nice to have an option to chose which reverse camera option you prefer... but I'm nitpicking now.===============================================================Review for G840H:It pleases me to be given opportunity to once again test another product of this company. A frind of mine was recently involved in a car accident and regrets not having one.Cutting to the chase just like G840S, the G840H provides you with the same quality feeling. The reverse camera feels heavy, but it must be due to its very good build quality. I have seen some plastic reverse cameras which I would not risk putting outside of the car, but this one, without a doubt in my mind can be easily installed over your number plate and configured with the DashCam to be your reverse prinking camera.The box comes with everything you need to do the initial installation. If you need the 24/7 parking mode enabled, a hardwire kit is required. This is standard across the industry. The hardwire kit is not expensive and you can get a good one for areound \u00a325.Picture quality:The camera records in 1440P and can be configured in settings to use either H.264 or H.265 compression. On the paper, 265 is better as offers better compression and more footage on the same memory card. In my private opinion I prefer the old H.264. I found it provides marginally better quality picture and the loss in form of bigger video files is the price I'm prepared to pay. Let's be honest, the 256GB cards are not that expensive these days.Reverse camera records at 1080P which is industry standard.Front and back camera angle coverage:Front record at 170 and captures nicely everything you need, even vehicles that are practically parked next to you. Back camera provides 140 degrees angle and this is everything you will ever need. There is currently nothing with wider angle or better quality from what I can see, but you are welcome to do your research.Memory card:The box comes with 32GB memory card. This is perfect to get the DashCam up and running straight away, nevertheless I do recommend upgrading to at least 128GB, or 256GB if you plan on using parking more.Installation:This cannot be any simpler. If you don't count the time to plug it into the power source, I doubt it will take you more than 30 seconds to get in installed. It's hard to describe it, but my advise it to simply put it over the mirror and wiggle around until you feel it sits comfortably, and then secure with straps.Settings:The camera has a huge screen and it is super easy to configure from software perspective. I do prefer this over cameras that need to be connected to over iOS/Android system. It is super responsive and provides immediate feedback.Box:Comes with everything you will need to get the device up and running. I have attached picture with items available in the G840H box.Pros:Just like G840H, the product is of premium quality. Also, if you like to see clearly what is behind you and could use a bit of zoom, think no more. The dash cam screen is big enough to provide you just that, and not big to make you feel like it covers the windscreen. Further to the above the cam comes with GPS so it can also record your speed and location. This is a huge advantage in case you have an unfortunate encounter and someone refuses to accept liability.Cons:This is more of preference. Although the 1440P video is perfectly sufficient to read the numberplates and to be used as evidence, I do prefer the 4k quality cams. If this is also your preference G840S from the same seller ticks all the boxes.",
