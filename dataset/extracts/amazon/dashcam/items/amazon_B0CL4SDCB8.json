                "reviewText": "I got this camera for my daughter to use during her commutes to and from work daily. She is a nurse and has a daily commute of over an hour each way to work daily and has to drive through congested areas on her trip. I think that it is always a great idea to have a dash camera in your vehicle for all trips as video proof during any accident or to have as video proof of other accidents that you may witness. This camera was a great choice due to the 1080P video clarity and it even came with a rear camera which van be recorded, unlike the backup camera on your vehicle. It locks in the video in a crash so that you will have it if you need it which is a great feature and the camera was easy to install and use. We have been very satisfied with this product.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Instructions as a little unclear, best you have some experience",
                "reviewText": "First of all I have to say that the screen on this camera is so small I searched through the box a couple of times before I realized that the camera back panel IS the screen. Definitely need to keep the reading glasses around for any in-vehicle reviews of the recordings.The second camera is tiny - smaller than a marshmallow, as it is simply a secondary with no capabilities other than sending the signal to the main camera. It looks like all the brackets you need for installation are included, along with both the SD card and the reader. There are several cables provided - one is a charging cable USB-C to your vehicles' cigarette lighter or similarly-shaped power outlet, USB to USB-C data transfer cable and the connection cable for the rear camera - that is where the limitations beyond the tiny screen come in.The item page reads that you can use these cameras in a car or truck, but that means the back window of the TRUCK CAB, not the back window of any topper you may have on your truck bed - there is not enough cabling for that. It doesn't seem to me to be enough cabling to reach the rear window of an average-sized SUV, either.The instruction booklet is pretty thorough once you get past the poor translations and I feel confident that I won't have too much trouble hooking it up. Now, successfully hiding the cable stretching from dash camera to rear window camera... probably not so much. I got this hoping I could find a way to install the rear camera in the back window of my RV trailer for added security but I would need many more feet of cable and a disconnectable junction at the rear tailgate for when I am NOT towing the trailer.If I can find the right cable as an extender I will update this review, but no news means I have only installed the front camera.This dash cam front and rear are rated 4.7/5 by the new users (this particular model was released Oct. 23, 2023), however I was unable to find anything about longer cables or modifications to that end. So far :)All in all without having been able to test it so far I can recommend it with a grain of salt - there seems to be a lot of attention paid to all the little parts you need to be able to install this yourself, the rear cam looks easy, just with a lot of cable-tucking.Recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I embarked on using a camera of this kind for the first time, making it a novel experience for me. Unboxing the product revealed a rather unexpected surprise \u2013 the viewing screen used to power the camera on/off and complete the setup is exceptionally small. For someone of my age, it's excessively tiny. Nonetheless, I resorted to using a magnifying glass (yes, I truly did) to navigate through the setup. It wasn't overly complicated and generally intuitive.The front-facing camera affixed to my windshield with a suction cup, which was straightforward. However, the rear camera presented a different dilemma. It's designed to be screwed into the carpeted board under the rear window, which poses an issue for a pickup truck like mine. Regrettably, the kit only included a suction device for the front camera, leaving the rear camera's mounting unresolved. I'm still exploring mounting options, and I'll update this review if I find a solution.The cord for the rear-facing camera is sufficiently long to stretch from the rear window to the front camera, but not long enough to be discreetly hidden. Similarly, the cord for the front camera is quite lengthy, resulting in most of it being coiled and tucked into a cubby near the plug.The camera comes with a micro-SD card pre-installed. \"Micro\" is indeed the operative word here, as my fingers are almost too large to handle it. Additionally, it includes a USB stick into which the SD card inserts, allowing you to download videos onto your computer \u2013 a handy feature for accident evidence.I deliberated between giving this product 3 or 4 stars. What nudged it lower on the rating scale is the minuscule screen size (making it difficult to read) and the issue of mounting the rear-facing camera in a pickup truck scenario. Nevertheless, I believe this serves as a decent entry-level camera. If you're seeking something that integrates better with your vehicle (concealed cords) and has a more legible screen, you might want to explore other brands.Pros:\u2022 Easy setup.\u2022 Easy installation (except for pickup trucks).\u2022 Micro SD card for video storage.Cons:\u2022 Extremely small screen size.\u2022 Limited options for mounting the rear-facing camera.My Take: I would recommend this with reservations.As a Vine reviewer, I'm mindful of the influence my reviews can have on fellow consumers. Just like you, I rely on reviews when making my own purchasing decisions. Therefore, I'm committed to providing valuable insights to those considering the products I review. Additionally, considering that I'm obliged to pay taxes on the retail value of the products I receive (approximately 40%, with 15.3% in Social Security/Medicare taxes and 25% in Federal Income taxes), I prioritize delivering honest reviews for every item I receive.For reference, here's how I rate products:- 1 Star: Do not buy. This item has serious flaws.- 2 Stars: Do not buy. Not as bad as a 1 Star, but it still has major downsides.- 3 Stars: Buy if you can't find an alternative. There are some issues that need to be worked out.- 4 Stars: Recommend purchase. This item met my expectations.- 5 Stars: I love this product.",
