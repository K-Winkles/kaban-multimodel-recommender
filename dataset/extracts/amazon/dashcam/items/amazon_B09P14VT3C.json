            "\u30101296P QHD & 140\u00b0 Wide-Angle FOV\u3011Equipped with a 3-megapixel camera, the 70mai Dash Cam M300 records in 2304 x 1296P HD high resolution, featuring almost 1.5 times clearer than the standard 1080P dash cams. The 70mai Dash Cam M300 can easily capture license plates, road signs, and other critical details on the road. With 140\u00b0 wide-angle FOV, this dash cam enables you to monitor more lanes with fewer blind spots",
            "\u30103D Noise Reduction & WDR Technology\u3011The 3D Noise Reduction algorithm removes unwanted pixels in the image and the WDR (Wide Dynamic Range) technology helps balance exposure level. Even in the low-light conditions, the 70mai Dash Cam M300 solidly provides you extremely clear and smooth image quality. No worries about losing important moments when driving in the tunnel, or under other undesirable lightings",
            "\u3010Parking Monitoring & Built-in G-Sensor\u3011With a built-in G-sensor enabled, the dash cam can detect sudden shakes or collisions around the vehicle even when you are away. The dash cam solidly provides a 24-hour parking monitor by automatically started recording as well as capturing any potential incidents around your vehicle and will notify you through voice alert once it's turned back on (Kind Reminder: The 70mai Hardwire Kit is required for parking surveillance mode and is sold separately.)",
            "\u3010Time-lapse Recording\u3011By compressing every 30 mins of footage into 1 min, your M300 enables long-term continuous recording at one frame per second while the car is parked. Hours-long surveillance video can be played back in minutes and catch crucial events quickly (Kind Reminder: The 70mai Hardwire Kit is required for time-lapse recording, and is sold separately.)",
            "\u3010Loop Recording & Evidence Protection\u3011The dash cam automatically overwrites the oldest videos with the latest ones. The videos can be automatically saved and stored locally on a microSD memory card while driving, which ensures the video evidence will be captured and safely secured from overwriting. It supports high-endurance Class 10 (and above) microSD memory cards from 16GB up to 128GB (not included)"

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the 70mai Dash Cam and I must say, it has completely exceeded my expectations. The standout feature for me is undoubtedly the app connectivity, which I consider a game-changer in the realm of dash cams. Being able to seamlessly connect the camera to my phone and access footage instantly is not only convenient but adds an extra layer of security.The camera quality is impressive, providing clear and sharp recordings, which is crucial for any road incidents. The design is sleek and unobtrusive, blending in well with my car's interior. It was easy to install and set up, which is a big plus.However, I believe there's always room for improvement. An enhancement in night vision capabilities or wider angle coverage could make this product absolutely perfect. But as it stands, I'm really satisfied with my purchase. The 70mai Dash Cam offers great value for its price, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and advanced dash cam solution.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I had a 70mai dash cam last summer, but I can\u2019t quite remember what I did with it. Decided to order a new one because not only is the price point good, but I\u2019m fond of the video quality. I previously had a 1080p model and chose to go with the 1296p model this time around.Pros:\u2022 Sleek and not large - it doesn\u2019t block your vision when driving\u2022 Comes with an electrostatic sticker instead of an awful suction cup, and so it sticks to the window better\u2022 Has a mobile app to adjust camera settings and review footage\u2022 Video and audio quality are goodCons:\u2022 Does not come with cable clips\u2022 Does not come with a trim tool to conceal the cord\u2022 USB adapter that comes in box only has one USB port\u2022 Does not come with Micro SD card\u2022 The mobile app can be challenging to navigate if you\u2019re a new user\u2022 You have to be in wifi range of the camera powered on before you can review footage4/5 stars from me! If there was a way to review footage in a cloud instead of needing to be near the camera, I\u2019d give it a 5.If you don\u2019t already have a Micro SD card, you\u2019ll need one. I believe this camera can accept one as high as 128gb. Totally recommend buying a car trim tool so you can conceal the cord. Recommend buying a USB adapter that has more than one USB port.",

Easy enough to do by pressing the on button 3 times, you don't even have to take thr card out but if there was something in the last 4 hours I would want to keep it would be lost. I thought maybe it was just the memory card but I have tried a few different ones. Same thing. The picture and video quality is really good. Very wide view aswell I can see about 10 feet each side of the hood of my vehicle. I would buy this again.",
