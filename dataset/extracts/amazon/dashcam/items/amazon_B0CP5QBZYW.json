Seamless Loop Recording When using the car cam, it is recommended to turn on the loop recording function, then the continuous recording will use 1/2/3 minutes of video clips to save in the memory card, reducing the trouble of manually formatting the memory card. Note that locked videos need to be deleted manually. 24H Parking Monitoring When parking, turn on the parking function. When the built-in gravity sensor of the dash cam with parking mode detects a collision, it will automatically record and lock the current video to retain important evidence. The 4k dash cam supports 24-hour monitoring.",

                "media_text": "FREQUENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q: How to playback the video on dash cam \uff1f A: Method 1: When the dash camera stops recording (press the OK key to stop recording), press the M button to select the video file and press the OK key to playback the video. Method 2: After the mobile phone is connected to the wifi of the dashcam, view the real-time recorded video and the recorded video on the app. Method 3: Put the dash cam's memory memory card into the card reader, and then connect the card reader to a personal computer to view the video. Q: Why does this dash camera suddenly turn on and then shut down when the car engine is turned off and the doors are opened/closed? A: This is because you have activated the parking mode. When the car is turned off and in the parking state, the vibration of opening/closing the car door is recognized as a car collision. This will automatically turn on and record emergency videos before turning off. If you really don't like this, we suggest that you turn off the parking mode. However, please note that if parking mode is turned off, once your car is hit during parking, it will not automatically start up to retain important evidence. Q: Does the package include the front snd rear dash camera? Does the dashcam have an inside camera? A:Yes, currently this 4K dash cam comes with the front and rear dashcam. Please be particularly careful not to include the inside camera. Please carefully read the packaging description of this 4K dash cam with wifi on Amazon's website when purchasing. Q: Do I have to connect to WiFi to use and operate this WANLIPO 4K dash cam? A:No, absolutely not, this dashcam can connect to the app via wifi to play back videos and manage settings. When the dashcam is in normal recording state, the blue indicator flashes once per second to indicate that it is recording. You can play back the video directly on the dashcam, or insert the card of the dashcam into the card reader and then connect it to a PC to play back the video. Q:Does this 4K dash cam with wifi require the purchase of additional hardware? A: No, absolutely not. This 4K dash cam with WiFi does not require the purchase of additional hardware kits to support parking mode. In fact, this dash cam comes with parking mode (default off). If you want to turn on parking mode, you need to click the menu button when the dash cam is stopped recording and go to the settings to find [Parking Mode] to turn it on. Some friends may have been prompted by the app's settings to purchase additional hardware for parking mode, but in reality, it is not necessary. We will fix this error in the app in the near future.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. When my better half purchased her new car a few years ago, I was really impressed with the backup cam function on her dash display.But my somewhat older car wasn't set up for that type of electronics display.But the more I drove her car, the more I realized just how helpful having both front and rear cameras would be in my normal everyday driving.Especially in SE Michigan, where winter conditions can create havoc on the roads, making you wish you had the ability to document what went down when things went sideways.So when I saw this Wanlipo Front and Rear Dual Dash Cam with 3 inch Screen, WiFi, G-Sensor, and Parking Monitor function, I decided that I needed to give it a try.Let me tell you, this kit more than surpassed my expectations!It has everything you need to get both front and rear cameras working with a minimum of fuss and bother.It includes a 12V power adapter, all of the cabling needed to run from the main camera to the rear camera, adhesive cord control pieces, a 32 GB SD card, and even includes an SD card adapter for transferring images from your cameras to a computer or other device.All of the buttons for operation are conveniently located on the camera housing.And although not required for full operation, there is also an app that you can download to assist you with the operation.About the only thing that I think I will add to this setup is a license plate mount for the rear cam vs using the supplied mount, and maybe a larger SD card, of which I have plenty.So if you have been thinking about adding a Front and Rear Dash Cam system to your vehicle, be sure to take a good long look at this Wanlipo Front and Rear Dual Dash Cam with 3 inch Screen, WiFi, G-Sensor, and Parking Monitor.I'm willing to be that you will be every bit as impressed as I am!",

                "reviewText": "This dash cam packs a lot of features for a low price. Installation was mostly a breeze. The camera locks onto the suction cup mount. Once positioned on the windshield, the suction cup holds the camera securely in place. The power cord is a suitable length to run it so that it\u2019s hidden from view. The included prybar and mount clips make it easy to push the cable into various gaps, so they are hidden and out of the way. In my car, I ran the cable along the top of the windshield, down the passenger side of the windshield, and underneath the glove compartment. The optional rear camera has an equally lengthy cable that allows it to be mounted on the rear window, but tucked away and hidden to where it plugs into the main camera. The rear camera can also be wired into the backup lamp, so that it only comes on and records when the car is put into reverse. I chose to have the rear camera constantly record just like the front camera.The device powers on when the car is started. The front camera takes up most of the screen, with the rear camera image displayed in the upper right corner. It automatically goes into record mode when powered on, but it has buttons on the side to switch between various options, start and stop recording, and take snapshots from the front and rear cameras.There is an optional companion app which allows the camera\u2019s memory card to be accessed over wifi. The card can be removed and inserted into a card reader directly on a PC to access the videos as well. The included memory card, while small in size, is a nice bonus.Despite a mostly informative manual, it didn\u2019t give a good explanation about the rear camera. The lack of proper documentation left me believing that it had to be connected to the back up lights and only operated when the car was in reverse.",

                "reviewText": "If you are in the market for a dashcam and totally new to what they do for you as a driver, this is the best choice for you. This dashcam comes with everything to get you started and install this important device in your car. In comes with a front AND a rear cam. The instructions are included to install (and you can find tutorials on YouTube). The front camera is nice and the picture is very clear. The box comes with wiring, adhesives, mounts, and even a tool to snugly hide the wring in your car's interior dash. The wifi capability is great for when you have to view an accident right when it has happened or show a police officer. The sound effects help to allow you to know when the camera is on and recording. It comes with SD cards and instructions, so you should have this up and running in your car within one hour.",

                "reviewText": "Many dashcams these day come with WiFi connectivity and require Viidure app for configuration. This camera recommends installing the app, too, but you do not have to. The camera has a considerably large screen on the back and a set of navigation buttons on both sides that can be used for reviewing images/videos and for configuration. Menus use large icons and are easy to navigate.4K resolution is an overkill for dashcam needs, 1080p is more that enough to record evidence. This camera allows recording 2K front plus 1080p rear. It is more important to have great nighttime recording capability. This camera, like most cameras in this price range, does not have a great sensor, and nighttime footage looks a bit grainy and blurry.Another downside is the suction cup mount. Adhesive-based mounts tend to stay on no matter what, in any weather. My experience with suction cup mounts is that most of them fall off after at most several hours in direct sunlight.",
