                "reviewText": "Good product for the price. They ought to invest a little more in customer service or product support because there is no telephone number or email on file. I would like to see this technology improved. I am unaware if there is a product that is closer to meeting my needs. What would it take to save all of these videos on the cloud? The SD card can be stolen and that makes the data vulnerable for loss. I also installed the 24 hour parking radar and it seems to work fine however the problem is with the app integration since I can only view the videos once I start my car. I thought I could connect the dash cam to a hotspot and have the videos accessible on my phone via the app from far away at any time just like a blink or ring camera. Aside from that as far as driving is concerned this dash cam will do just fine recording while on the road. In the event of an accident and I must save the evidence (hopefully this doesn\u2019t happen) I guess I will have to screen record my videos or take out the SD card since I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to download the videos and save it to my phone or cloud. I reported a bug on the TsCam app because the menu options contained words spelled incorrectly words like Videos and Emergency are spelled like \u201cVidoes\u201d and \u201c Emgncery\u201d so please fix.",
