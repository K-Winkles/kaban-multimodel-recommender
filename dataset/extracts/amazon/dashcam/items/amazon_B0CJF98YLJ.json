The video is very clear both in day and night.It was very easy to install the camera following the instruction, the app works very well. Due to loop recording, the 32 gb memory comes with it is enough.I'm fully satisfied with this product and its a must have item for every car.",

                "reviewText": "The dash cam does its job, and it\u2019s relatively easy to install, but there are a few downsides to it. It doesn\u2019t have amazing night settings; it\u2019s hard to see through the lights to actual other cars, as I noticed when I played back someone cutting me off and found that you can only see their car once it\u2019s directly in front of mine, even though the camera had the other car in its scope for the entire time. It\u2019s not super quality video, but again, it gets the job done. The settings are a little difficult to navigate, and it almost seems like an older camera, especially with the loading screens and beeps it makes, which thankfully you can disable. The suction cup works great, but the fastenings for the back-up camera (the screws) were either missing in my order or misplaced, so I didn\u2019t end up installing that portion. I only really wanted it for the forward-facing camera, anyway. The audio recording isn\u2019t amazing either, you can\u2019t hear things super clearly, but again, it does what it\u2019s supposed to do. It\u2019s small, so it doesn\u2019t take up too much of your view, and the wire the plugs into the lighter outlet isn\u2019t bulky, so you can hide it pretty easily in cracks. The power is a little finicky, though. If you don\u2019t have it perfectly lined up, the thing will turn on and off randomly on long drives, over and over until it just sort of seems to make up its own mind and starts working again. So yeah, it works okay, but there are probably better cams out there for the money.",
