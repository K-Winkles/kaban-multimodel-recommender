I started accumulating crazy incidents on the road almost immediately. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the water here in Eugene, OR, but people drive a bit weird.The problem.After installation, well, exactly 10 days after installation the unit failed. First, the main camera would not record, the file would form but my computer wasn\u2019t able to see the corrupted file. The back camera kept working but those files also would be corrupted. Then the main screen went all purple, see attached picture. The voice commands, which is one of the best nicest features of this dash cam always continued to work perfectly. I reset the thing 3 times but the errors continued. I was so frustrated that I unplugged the dash cam and gave up. I don\u2019t know what happened but when I tried to find costumer service for Viofo, I was directed to a sight where people were posting issues, but there were no solutions there. I was like a forum.The Solution.I forgot about the dash cam for a while. Life happens. Anyhow, one day I was messing around with Amazon and the item came to my attention. I decided to put a review complaining about my experience with the camera and the failure. Incredibly, not 24 hours after that review, the company contacted my using the Amazon system. They were very concern about my issues with their dash cam and extremely apologetic that I had to go through those situations with it. At the end, we could not solve the issues and they decided to issue me a complete refund. I had to send them the dash cam so they could do an autopsy of the thing and see what went wrong, I figure a bad chip somewhere. It happens from time to time wit electronics. Belive me, I had my fair share of bad machines in my life. But one thing I have never had is a company handle a situation like that as efficiently, and fast as Viofo did with me. I am dry happy and pleasantly surprised of their reaction to my review. If toy ever have a problem with any of their products, contact them, they will help you right away to solve your problems or refund you in full if they can\u2019t help you. To Viofo I say, thanks you guys for all your help with my problem.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I strongly recommend this dashcam (A229 Duo Front & Rear)",
                "reviewText": "I watched and read about a dozen reviews prior to purchasing this dashcam. The biggest determinant for me was the implementation of Parking Mode (which includes it's myriad of features and settings) and I am VERY pleased with the features and settings that this camera system provides. Thumbs way up for the A229 Duo!PROS:It does many things really, really well and while I am still in the first week of actual use, I can already tell that this one is a keeper, from the excellent menu layout to the minimalistic design of both cameras and their cable connection locations. I just hope it is well-made and lasts a good, long time.I think the best feature of this camera is the super capacitor, in lieu of the lithium battery that we typically see in most other dashcams. This is a technological innovation and leads to a cooler running and longer life, in my opinion.I also love the small display screen and buttons on this camera because I don't EVER have to use the app in order to review videos, make setting changes, etc.The single coaxial cable to the rear camera is super thin, stiff and tough and was just long enough to run from the head of the dashboard to the center of the rear hatch window of my Volvo XC60. Many reviewers and videos are out there so I will not repeat what many others have discussed but I think the plethora of menu options and the fact that I can use it without an app if I choose are two of its greatest strengths.The Parking Mode on this camera is the main reason why I chose VioFo over the other brands. Everything about this mode is what I was looking for - motion detection with three sensitivity settings or time lapse with several different frame rates (WOW!), then you can set the bit rate, too and the resolution. It is pretty crazy to have so much control over things that it could be a CON to some people (so I listed this as one, below)The hardwire kit (sold separately) makes the Parking Mode recording possible and this simple to install kit deserves recognition for affordability (other kits from other OEMs actually cost a lot more) and even has a physical voltage drop protection toggle switch to protect your car's battery.CONS:The Menu/REC button does not always register my press to enter the menu. I've had to power it down, then restart it a few times over the last two weeks. Rebooting takes a few seconds so it has not been any trouble. I don't see this as any sort of dealbreaker.I mentioned that there are lots of different options to configure and for me, it is pure love. I will be spending a week or two fine tuning the experience but there are probably many folks out there who will find the dozen or so settings and sub-menus a little daunting, especially if they are not tech-savvy. The manual is not the best so I would suggest looking on YouTube and the VioFo websites for instructions and help. Tech support will be key for you. I listed this as a CON not for me but for those whose eyes glaze over when we start talking about 2K resolution (is not really 2K on this device, it's actually a little higher!) and don't know how to calculate GMT from their local time zone.I only have one concern and it is with any dashcam with a parking mode - what effect will this have on the alternator over a long period of time (say, a year or more)? For the convenience this technology gives me, I'm ok to go along for the ride ;-)",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great all around dash cam",
                "reviewText": "Solid feature set and very good quality. I believe this model hits the sweet spot as far as resolution goes. Although you're not getting 4K, it more than makes up for it in low light performance. The 2K rear camera produces great quality video as well. The smaller connectors on the rear video cable were a plus as far as routing around pillars and through the headliner, but be very careful as the connector ends are very delicate. I ended up damaging one end when it got stuck behind the B pillar on my truck. I'd recommend wrapping the ends with some electrical tape before subjecting it to any rough handling. In case you're in a bind and need a replacement cable quick, the Blackvue coax cable with MCX connectors will work for the Viofo rear camera (although the plugs don't seat as far into the camera as the original) and you can get it from Amazon in 2 days. Getting Viofo customer support to send me a replacement cable was a slow process that was going to take a month with shipping and a Chinese holiday.The 5 Ghz wireless and the phone app work great once you figure it out. I had to put my Iphone into airplane mode before it would stay connected to the dash cam. Once it's connected, it's very easy to change settings and the 5 Ghz WIFI makes managing video clips quick and painless. Make sure you use a high endurance SD card as Viofo recommends (Samsung Pro Endurance, Sandisk High Endurance, or Viofo brands). Also, ensure you're buying your card from a reputable seller such as Amazon so you don't get stuck with a counterfeit SD card that will drive you nuts when troubleshooting camera issues.I'd also recommend getting the circular polarization filter for the front camera to get rid of glare on the dash and windshield. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "After using the VIOFO a229 Dual 2K dash camera for three months I can honestly say this is by far the nicest dash cam I've owned so far. It is also the most expensive camera I've had and I have to admit, the quality of both the build and video is superior to my previous cameras so I feel the price is justified. In my experience you truly do get what you pay for.Video quality in the daylight is very nice. In the dark or at night, much like every other dash camera you do lose detail but it is still good enough to do the job it is intended for. I have yet to see any dash camera that produces excellent night results. That just asks too much of the current technology and to be honest, if it was able to happen, the price of the dash cam would be much more expensive. But I'm am completely happy with the video output.VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure you order and use a recommended MicroSD card. Others have had issues but I made sure I got a quality card and haven't had any issues yet.I also ordered the polarized lens cover which helps with reflections and glare on the windshield. And I have purchased the Bluetooth remote trigger to lock videos and it works very well so far.I have no issues recommending this camera to others. My only advice would be to save it to a wish list and monitor for price changes as it does go on sale for much less from time to time. I got mine at a reduced cost.",
