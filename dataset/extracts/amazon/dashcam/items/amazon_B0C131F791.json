                "reviewText": "This might be a good product for your vehicle/dashcam, but for me its a hard pass. My first issue is fuse type compatibility. There are at least 4 different types of fuses for cars: ACZ(micro2), ACS(mini), ACN(LP-mini) and ACU(ATO) . This product uses type ACS but my car is ACU. My bad for not paying better attention to this before ordering. This is showstopper #1 for me. The design is also is assuming you have an open slot in your fusebox - as these are not piggyback leads. showstopper #2. Examination of the product reveals that the fuses are permanently attached to the leads (glued?). If an electrical problem occurs on your dashcam, the fuse will blow ( as it should !) but there is no way to replace the blown fuse once the electrical problem is corrected. You will need to replace the hardwire kit. Expense and hassle of reinstall. showstopper #3. This one is being returned. Edit: I added two stars to the rating as the customer service team proactively contacted me after the initial review.",
