                "reviewText": "It messes with the phone operation however for the price it's worth it if your not on your phone's bluetooth the entire trip . It's annoying but I'm probably not returning it . Because the cost to replace it is alot compared to what I spent. And once I unplug it every thing is back to normal. So if you can deal the price is right. The video is good but upgrade the memory card.",
