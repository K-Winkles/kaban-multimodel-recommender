                "reviewText": "I have the 140 in my truck and love it. It has a screen for viewing.This mini is perfect for my new car for its size and ease of mounting. I have one facing forward and one in the rear.My car is an ioniq 5 limited with 6 built in cameras that you can not download or store video from. So you have to mount dash cameras next to installed cameras. Ugh.Fortunately, this mini is small a d easy to mount in tight places. The front camera is on the passenger side of the rear view mirror mount. The rear camera is just below the rear viewing camera where it is hard to see the camera but has a great view.I had best buy install both cameras. Front camera is being powered from the 12 volt accessory outlet under the dash, centerline next to bluelink port. Not hardwired. Rear camera is powered from 12 volt accessory outlet, driver side back left corner of the boot area. There is a good OBD2 dual usb power plug available from garmin with a selectable power type. Power for 10 minutes after shutdown, 24 hours, or continuous power. I. Ight switch to that but that would mean a long cord for rear viewing.I put in a 256g card for storing video. After 1,500 miles I still haven't filled the card. Make sure you use the garmin recommended card type. Trust me, it makes a difference.My only issue is the constant red light. Thankfully, I can not see the forward one from the drivers seat and the rear viewing one is not in my rear view due to my rear view mirror is actually a video view from the car's rear camera just above my garmin one.Flawless integration with App. If you really need to download video take the card out of the camera and download directly to phone, tablet or computer to save time. Downloading with App takes forever.",

Good quality picture as well, i plug mine into the 12v outlet in the car because it turns off when switch the car off.Only thing that is a pain is the connectivity with bluetooth/wifi it drops out and is a little awkward to connect. So that is why i give it 4 stars",

When you get the video from the SD card, the quality is FANTASTIC. I got a Micro SD reader that plugs in to my phone. It\u2019s perfect!Original:The camera is amazing. I have one on my front windshield, one on the rear window. They sync together! However\u2026 I have to take the Micro SD card out of the cameras to utilize the footage!! This is due to the absolute CRAP app that Garmin has constructed. I can\u2019t get a single thing to load, not even the live view. These cameras still serve my needs and I can still make the settings however I want. I\u2019d say they\u2019re worth it.Also, I like how there\u2019s no screens! No extra light in my cabin to tire out my eyes at night.",

                "reviewText": "After having this device and the constant power attachment to the OBD2 port for a few months here's a few things about it.\u2022 sometimes it doesn't even work.- I have it hooked up to my OBD2 port so I can utilize the park mode when my car isn't on. After about a month of use sometimes the device doesn't even turn on. It's happened to me twice where I almost got into an accident and it wasn't even recording.\u2022 It doesn't automatically save to the SD card I have in it.- sometimes things will happen and I want to show people some of the dumb things people do on the road because I spend most of my time driving so I see a lot. By the time I get around to showing people, the video was never saved and had already been written over.\u2022 The export time takes forever- the app is VERY buggy which makes it hard to use, device loses wifi connection mid-export and even just to export just a minute of footage it takes 10 minutes. Good luck with anything over a minute.\u2022 Gets very hot- like the first generation's overheating issues, this one also gets so hot you can't touch it. Nice window defogger though. At least it can still see when there is dew or snow over the spot because it melts it right away.Some good things about it at least\u2022 very small easy to conceal\u2022 has an app to access videos and settings (if you can get it to connect)\u2022 resolution is good and clear\u2022 audio on/off featureOverall, I would not recommend it. Other garmin devices may work better but this is just not it. I wasted my money on this. Save yourself some heartache and go with something else.",

I bought 2 cords for it so I can just pop it off one car, and when I move to a different vehicle I plug it in and go. Easy. The UV filter helps a lot in Southern California sun. It\u2019s an expensive addition but helps a lot. I might buy a second am for the back window. Garmin will always be a great company for cameras, gps and watches.",

                "reviewText": "Its clever to take out the built-in screen used on other cameras that is not needed most of the time. This saves space and money.The camera is easy to setup and install.Mine didnt come with the cloth as advertised.2 cables are included, one for power and one (shorter) one for data transfer.The very sticky windshield mount is small and 2 are included. The ball socket is tight and gives infinite adjustment. The camera is lightweight and stays in place.The power cable is long with a mini-USB on one end (for camera) and a USB-A on the other. A 12V cigarette lighter adapter is included if you need it, or you can plug it directly into a USB-A port.Because of its size its easy to mount this anywhere. I mounted mine in front of my rearview mirror and I cant see it when im driving. 2 LED lights on the unit indicate status.Downloading the free Garmin App and connecting is simple. You can live view for adjusting and also adjust other settings and view recorded videos and pictures.Image quality is HD and files are a good size, unlike 4K files which are large.Im using the recommended high quality microSD card (Sandisk High Endurance) to ensure fast and reliable recording.Overall a very good dashcam from a trusted brand.",

Repito, cumple con su funci\u00f3n, calidad-precio, y pues llevo poco tiempo us\u00e1ndola, pr\u00e1cticamente 25 d\u00edas, pero ha funcionado a la perfecci\u00f3n, actualizare alg\u00fan detalle que pudiera surgir mas adelante, y se los hare saber.",
