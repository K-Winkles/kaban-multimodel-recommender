The second one I purchased worked for a few days but now it just chimes all the time when it's plugged in and does not record. I would not recommend this camera . I am so disappointed that the two cameras were defective . I wasted all this time and effort to put them in the car. I know next time when I buy a dash cam to give it time before I hide the wires in the car and make it all nice only to have to disassemble it and this was for the two cameras.",

                "reviewText": "I like this dash cam. It works as expected.The design and overall appearance looks good. No external imperfections could be noticed, it comes across as a clean and well-built gadget.The dash cam is made of plastic, which feels fairly strong. The quality of the material used here makes it quite durable, a good attribute for a device meant to be used in a vehicle.The installation process was simple, taking about 10 minutes in total. To install, all that was needed was to connect the dash cam to a power outlet and then to the phone. I particularly love that no batteries need to be replaced, and it uses a car battery for power through a USB-C cable, which is really convenient. I particularly like that it uses USB-C considering it is the new cable standard, meaning all new devices are coming with this cable so if this one gets lost or broken, it can easily be replaced.After a fairly easy configuration process that took about 15 minutes, it worked as expected. It has a good quality camera and multiple configurations that makes this camera really useful. What I\u2019m most interested about is its loop recording, which means I don\u2019t have to keep deleting stuff to make space to keep recording, and that it has a good quality camera, which it does.Overall, I believe this dash cam to be a good investment. It's convenient to use, easy to install, and it works as expected.",

                "reviewText": "Let\u2019s face it, we live in uncertain times and when it comes down to he said, she said, it\u2019s nice to have irrefutable proof of what happened in a particular situation. Installation in my Kia was fairly easy. I don\u2019t like putting apps on my phone, I find most to be buggy and intrusive. However, I installed this on an old phone that I use for experimenting and it was a little wonky to use at times, but it did the job. There isn\u2019t a lot of customization after the fact so how you install the actual camera is critical. The multi picture view is a cool feature. The case seems fairly rugged but I don\u2019t know if it could take a lot of abuse, like in a work vehicle. However, for the typical passenger car, this will be fine. For a permanent installation, you will have to be creative with how to run wires. That will take a lot of time and effort to do right. For the price, the resolution is acceptable. If you are a person that drives all day every day, I\u2019d probably upgrade to something a little better and more robust. If you\u2019re just looking for a little extra security on the road, this is a good place to start. You\u2019ll probably want to upgrade your memory and storage capacity.",
