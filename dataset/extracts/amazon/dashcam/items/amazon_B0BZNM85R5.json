A: Since the dash cam and the car ignition are connected through a car charger, once the car is turned off, the dash cam will shut down immediately and cannot continue to work. Q: Why does this 4K dash cam with wifi suddenly switch on and off when the car engine is turned off and the doors are opened/closed? A:This is because you have park mode on. When the car is closed and parked, the vibration of opening/closing the door is recognized as a car crash. This will automatically turn on and record an emergency video before turning off. If you really don't like this, we recommend turning off Parking Mode. However, be aware that if Parking Mode is turned off, it will not activate automatically to preserve important evidence should your car be hit while parked.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because I wanted to get a dash mount camera for recording video when I drive. I drive a lot for my job and I think it\u2019s good to record what\u2019s happening on the road in case something happens.This was fairly inexpensive and had features I was looking for. First I will say that it takes pretty good video. It\u2019s not as good as some of the very expensive high end dash cam systems but it\u2019s more than good enough for what I need. I like that it records to an SD card so I can move the video to my laptop or other external storage. The system even comes with one but I purchased a much larger 2TB one.The picture is bright and easy to see but you have to really be careful how you mount the camera. Take your time and do lots of testing with placement so you do not end up with video of the sky or your vehicle hood.It comes with double sided tape to mount the camera. This is good to make the camera easy to remove. It\u2019s definitely not a permanent mount option. If you want to permanent mount the camera, you will need some silicone adhesive.The app is pretty straight forward and allows you to review the video during and after it is taken. I worry about the privacy of the app data being that it is a foreign company. I don\u2019t put anything personal on the app if I can help it.The camera could be a little smaller but it\u2019s not too bad. It doesn\u2019t block the windshield as long as you mount it high enough. I do wish it was a smaller foot print but I understand that it contains both the camera and the recorder.My big issue is the long cable that needs to run from the camera to a power source. The kit comes with these little stick in clips to run the cable but they are garbage. They don\u2019t stick very well to the glass and/or dashboard and they break very easily. There has got to be a better way to run the cable or make it rechargeable with a built in battery.The install was frustrating and I actually went and purchased my own 3M mounting tabs and clips. I had to get creative and run it under my dashboard so it was hidden and I wouldn\u2019t kick it by accident.Overall it\u2019s not a bad solution. But I think they should rethink the install process. Put more thought into the install process. Use a rechargeable battery for example.I\u2019m taking a star off because of the installation. Four stars from me on this one.",

                "reviewText": "The camera records in 5-min blocks of time starting at the top of every hour. When memory fills up, the oldest videos are deleted to make room for the new ones.If something happens in front of you that you want to retain, you simply press the \"lock\" button on the camera. This will save it forever so that you can (connect with your phone and) review it later. The \"trick\" with this is that it will only lock the 5 minute video block that you are in. So if the incident happened at 4:44:30 and you hit the lock at 4:45, you'll lock in the 4:45-4:50 block. This means you should go back and review your locked videos as quickly as possible to make sure you have the correct one saved.To access the camera you connect to its wireless access point with your phone and their dedicated app.I noted that when the camera is set to record at the best quality, it does take a while to copy video to my phone.As far as picture quality: It's pretty good but like most inexpensive dash cams, it isn't quite good enough to get a CLEAR picture of license plates. That said, I WAS able to get partial plate numbers in a couple of situations. This combined with the obvious color, make, and model of a vehicle provide all that is needed to positively identify it.",

                "reviewText": "If you're looking for a dash cam that can capture every detail of your high-speed adventures, the GoodTS 4K Dash Cam might be what you need. This sleek and shiny device delivers what it promises to deliver: 4K ultra-high-definition resolution up to 3840*2160P@30fps, F1.6 aperture and 6 glass lenses, and a nitrous oxide booster that lets you accelerate your video recording with the push of a button. Well, I feel that, like my nitrous oxide booster button claim, those specs were also exaggerated.The GoodTS 4K Dash Cam Front is not just a camera; it's a companion. You can connect it to your smartphone via built-in WiFi and control it with the Viidure app. You can live preview, download, and share your footage with your friends or the world. There were supposed to be voice prompts guiding you through the settings and functions, but I never heard anything.The GoodTS 4K Dash Cam Front also has some smart features that protect you and your car. It has a G-sensor function that automatically locks the current video in case of a collision or a sudden braking event. It also has two parking monitor modes that record what happens when you're away from your car. You can choose between collision parking monitoring mode or time-lapse recording mode which supports 24/48/96 hours safe parking. These sound like cool features, but I didn't try any of that stuff because I'm not interested in using it.The videos play well on my phone, both in the app and after being downloaded. However, when transferred to my PC, I couldn't get VLC to play them without stuttering. After re-encoding using VidCoder, they play fine using VLC. I'm not sure what is going on here.The camera should have some better options for mounting. I drive company cars, and since it's rarely the same vehicle, I can't leave anything in it when I'm done. My last dash cam could be easily clipped to the sunvisor, but this cam has nothing of the sort. It just has its own non-standard window mounting bracket.The cam has a USB-C input for power, but I couldn't get it to work with any power cord other than the provided cigarette lighter cord. I've tried a variety of USB-C cords, chargers, and power sources. NOTHING worked but the provided cord. Some of my work cars even have a USB-C power output port on the dash, but I can't make use of them. With this camera, it's the cigarette lighter cord or nothing.I deducted one star for the power cable limitation and one for the lack of mounting options. The best parts of this camera are the well-designed Viidure app and the video quality itself. It's very sharp and crisp.The GoodTS 4K Dash Cam Front is a great dash cam for anyone who loves speed, thrills, and adrenaline. It's like having your own personal Fast and Furious movie every time you hit the road. Just don't forget to buckle up and drive safely.",
