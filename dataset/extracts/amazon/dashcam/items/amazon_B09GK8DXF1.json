The dual dash cam can record video with the screen turned off while you use the screensaver feature, it won't distract the driver and protect privacy. If you want the dash cam records video with screen turn on, just turn off the screensaver feature. How to install the suction cup mount to keep it won\u2018t fall off the windshield\uff1f Fristly, put the mount into the slot of the dash cam, and push it to the right to fix it. Then clean and dry the windshield, remove the protector film of the suction cup. Next attach it to the windshield and twist the bracket to lock it. Does the dash cam need to always plug in when it is recording? Yes, the small built-in battery is used to save setting and time, and parking monitor. It won't last too long, so when the car camera is recording it needs to be continuously connected to the power supply. What kind SD card does this dual dash camera need? This uber dash cam can use high quality U3 above 32~128GB Micro SD card. There is a 64GB U3 Micro SD card in the package, please kindly format the SD card when first use. How does one download the videos to view? There is a mini USB in the package, use it connect the dash cam to computer, then you can view and download the video. Or you can remove the SD card from the dash cam and use a SD card read to replay and download the video to your computer.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great dash cam, works great for my car, holds well, good clear picture",
                "reviewText": "The first thing I will say about this is that you should charge this device right away as the camera could already be low on power. I would recommend charging it in your home before installing it into your car so you can have plenty of power before installing this in your car. It does come with tools needed to install or uninstall (it came with a prying tool). This is a pretty nice camera to have if you are looking for the bit of additional security for your car. The camera does require a cable to charge or power the device. The nice thing is that the cables that it comes with is super long. This can make the cables easier to hide in your car as you can tuck it into the edges. It also runs pretty far. One thing the cables are fairly thick so it can be a challenge to fold to your liking but at least you know it's durable. Also, the small screen is not very noticeable on the dashcam which is great for space saving while giving you the option of playing back the video. When driving, the screen does turn off so it does not hinder your driving but it is still recording. It also does not blind you with the screen brightness although this is placed in front of my rear view mirror. Again it does have an internal battery to keep the device running while you are away from your car. It will not constantly record and shut off after a certain amount of time. It comes with a suction to mount it on your window which is what I recommend for the best view. Mounting it on your your dash can damage it overtime also I am not really sure if you can invert the image when recording (never tried). Right off the bat, this product does come with all the wiring you will need to hook this device up. It also has the necessary length. The nice thing is that the second camera can be turned around to face you and record the inside of your car. This is great if you happen to be driving uber. You do need to turn the second camera around as it is facing forward when you first get it. Also the screen will always default to the forward camera as well when you want to view it on the small screen. The cameras themselves are fairly easy to install in the back and front. I had a chance to test it in rain weather and the camera still provides a good picture through the rain soaked window. In my option, the front camera is actually nicer than the other in terms of video and picture quality. That being said, it provides the best recording in case something was to happen. The controls do take some time to get used to. The buttons do have labels on them that you cannot really read from a distance but I got it memorized overtime. I would recommend having it plugged in at all times to let it recharge during the drive. The battery has not degraded from all the constant charging that I can tell. There is a down side to this in that the device does not always power on when I turn my car on. It sometimes resets and turns off which is a bit annoying. Because the screen is off when on stand by and driving, sometimes I do not notice it is not on at all. Now I have never ran into anything so I am unsure if it will actually continue to record on collision nor would I ever want to be in a collision. It does however keep a pretty good recording. Be aware the screen is not touch screen and has to be controlled via controls on the side. I did try installing at 128 gb card but it does come with a 64 gb micro sd card which should be more than enough memory for what you need. The 128 gb did work with it but I did not try anything higher than that so I am not really sure if it will work. It records in a loop so it'll override any old footage. Overall the dash cam is nice. It turns on by itself when you power the car on. It has decent video quality and it is nice that both cameras are on one unit. Be aware to turn the camera in one direction as it will not turn in the other. Also do not turn on the hinges too fast to avoid breaking it. I also like it provides a lot of different accessories and tools. It also easy to remove the camera from the mount so you can easily take it to remove footage and such. That being said there is no kind of security lock of any kind so the camera can easily be taken off.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first dashcam but did not want to spend a lot of money on a product that I was not sure I would like. I took a gamble on this treasure and think it is absolutely amazing. Firstly, it is very inexpensive when compared to the name brand dashcams, but it looks and works the same. It comes with the option of using a glue mount of suction and I mounted it on the right side of the rearview mirror at the top edge of the roof/window frame. It does not obstruct my view, even at night the light is barely noticeable; perhaps due to the distance it is from me being that it is in a SUV. Installation was easy and everything needed for installation is included. The only wire that is visible is about 4 inches on the window frame when crossing it from the windshield seal to the door seal, but it crosses right above the glove compartment and is barely noticeable. The viewing area is small and having the outside view and cabin view both displayed is a little challenging to see from a distance (don't forget it is in a SUV), but the high dollar dashcams do not have a large viewing area either. The description says that it will capture an accident and store the video while in park mode, but I was not sure if it worked until one day I did not turn on the camera and was driving through a parking deck with speed strips and bumps and when my SUV shook from driving over the strips the camera came on and started recording. My gamble paid off. Great camera, great picture quality, great price, and easy installation. Having inside cabin and outside road recordings is just a little more assurance for safety.",

                "reviewText": "The Lamtto Dual Dash Cam offers front and inside recording at 1080P resolution, making it an attractive choice for those wanting comprehensive coverage, especially for taxis or vehicles frequently on the road. Its IR night vision capability ensures that nighttime recordings remain clear and detailed.However, there are areas where the product could see improvements. Notably, stability is a concern. The hoof to attach the mounting plate to the camera is not designed deep enough, leading to the camera easily detaching, especially when encountering potholes or rough terrains. It's a significant downside for a dash cam where reliability is crucial.Additionally, while it comes with a 64GB memory card, users may find this storage capacity insufficient for extended use. Considering the high-resolution recordings, it quickly fills up, necessitating frequent data transfers or a need to upgrade to a larger memory card for more extended periods of recording.In conclusion, while the Lamtto Dual Dash Cam has its strengths in video quality and night vision, potential buyers should be aware of its stability issues and consider investing in a larger memory card for optimal use.",

I'm a fan of dash cams as as security feature for every car and this product has checked all requirements so far.Installation was fairly easy, the power cord is connected to the lighter outlet. Using the tool provided the power cord can be routed underneath the headliner for a clean install. The camera turns on and start recording both front and interior whenever you start the car, nice feature.The video quality is great with crisp images and wide angles. When the lighting is poor it switches to night vision automatically.Pros:- Small size, easy installation- Lots of features and easy menu accessibility- Quality of image and video, and sound- Ability to record inside the vehicle (this feature is what the kids like the most!)Cons:- No major issues so far",
