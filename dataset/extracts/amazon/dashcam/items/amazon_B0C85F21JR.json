                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is an absolute stunner of a dashcam at this price! After comparing many products, I bought this dual-cam dash cam for my new car.After using it for 2 weeks, here is what I think.PROS:1. Extremely easy to install. The booklet and the YT videos make it very easy to install the product on you own.2. Picture quality is super clear (@ 2.5K/1080 resolution). The full HD resolution ensures clear footage, even in the dark. The lens has a wide angle view capturing every details.3. The product comes with an app which can help you setup the camera settings. And it is extremely easy to format the SD card in seconds.4. The G-sensor technology detects shocks or collisions and automatically saves that footage, which I have confirmed myself.5. The loop recording feature is a plus, without you having to worry about storage.6. Customer support from the seller is amazing, they promptly responded to my queries.CONS:1. The rear camera requires some effort to install (it could be just me). The rear camera quality is okay as compared to the front. You can make out license details from the rear cam recordings, but will find it difficult to find minute details.Overall, I am satisfied with the purchase and would recommend to my friends as well.",

I\u2019m only going to use the front cam, because I want to avoid using the long cord to connect the two. The picture on the camera is very clear and the suction to keep it on the front window is very strong. This will be handy to use on long drives. I\u2019m glad I decided to get this.

The camera turns on/off whenever the car is turned on/off which makes it easy to use. You can easily download the footage directly to your phone or computer.It works great, with 1080p, which is all you really need because you don't want to use too much space and gives more spread of the timeline of recording. It will overwrite previous recordings which is nice so you only need the footage of when something happens and not worry about managing the storage.Overall, a really good budget camera you can easily install and forget about!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a dash camera to mount in a vehicle that I drive back and forth from western NL to Florida in. When traveling such long distances on busy highways, a lot can happen and I wanted protection in case of a dispute. This camera had all the features I needed and then some and had good reviews. For the price I think its a bargain for the protection it provides. It even has an extra camera you can direct out the back window, or at the driver and passengers or wherever. The front camera mounting hardware with suction cup seems to be of good quality although the little cable clips for securing the cables are kind of cheap and will barely stick to smooth plastic or glass. I had to get creative when running the cable for the rear camera but they were plenty long even for a full size SUV. I used the provided bracket and 3M tape and stuck the rear camera to the inside of the back window but you can mount it outside on a bumper as well although it would get pretty dirty out there I think.You can save video on the camera itself or use the app on your phone and save and share video from there. It was fairly easy to set up and use. It comes with a built in memory card which is convenient. You can lock videos manually with the touch of a button or the camera will automatically lock it if it senses a sudden jarring like when an accident occurs. You can also set it up to record video if it senses movement when the car is parked overnight in a driveway or parking lot and someone is trying to steal it. However you have to connect it to an uninterrupted power supply to the car battery in order for this to work which I didn't do.Both cameras front and back have very good video quality both day and night, even licence plate numbers of other vehicles are readable.Overall, I think its a good investment for the protection and I'll see how good it is a year from now and beyond. Hopefully I'll never have to submit any video to the police!",

                "reviewText": "This is based on front and rear installation, just one trip and downloads, but have not tried motion sensing or parking features so read on:Well packed in the box with components not looking cheap at all. There is an extra unmentioned plastic tool for installing cable behind rubber seals. User manual is a good quality booklet in colour so not cheap at all. It would be nice to have one or two spare 3M sticking pads as I found out.Installation was straight forward with adequate, sturdy cables, unfortunately of plastic so inflexible at 0\u00b0C. Suction cup and lever for installing are good. One design fault is that above the camera there is little room for the mount, cable from rear cam and power cable. See in the photo how the USB cable end is pushed over by the suction cup and there is no room to get fingers onto the cam position lock nut. I think the rear cam cannot be installed with cam above mount (like on the roof) because the image would appear upside down. No provision in software to invert it.Can't comment on picture quality but don't forget to remove lens plastic protectors. Seven buttons on the sides of the cam are accessible and labeled on the front bezel so you can see what each does. Connection to the phone app is straight forward and video clips download via WiFi OK. I note that the cam records files for both front and rear whether you want the rear or not. I will keep the rear plugged in because my van needs it as a back-up camera, which performs that function well.So 5 star and so far so good.",

                "reviewText": "I've had a couple of months with this camera now and overall it is a great dash cam. The front-facing camera has exceptional image quality for the price and the rear camera is pretty decent. Installation is relatively simple and the build quality feel is good. I've had no issues with the camera so far over the last couple of months using it. There are a couple of small things that could be addressed to make this better. First, the USB C connector for the camera is a straight cable and can be challenging to plug in and unplug if your vehicle has a sloping windshield. As you can see, the cable is wedged up against my windshield which is not ideal, but it's the only way I can plug it in. It would be better if the USB C had a 90\u00b0 end on it. Second, the adhesive on the provided cable clips is not very strong. Overall, for the price I paid, it is a solid camera.",
