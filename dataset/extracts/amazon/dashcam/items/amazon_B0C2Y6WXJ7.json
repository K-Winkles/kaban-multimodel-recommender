                "reviewText": "So far so good with my dash cam. It was simple to install the dash cam (I am not using the backup cam that came with it since my car already has one). The camera comes on when I start the vehicle and the videos have all been clear. The screen does not constantly run, probably to not cause a distraction, but the unit is still recording. It is a nice little camera. I've only used it a few times in the dark. It does record but picture is not as clear in night vision as I need. There may be a setting that will make it better but I have not investigated that yet. The screen is small and installed on the passenger side so I would need to unmount to see the screen. Overall, I am happy.",

                "reviewText": "The daschcam is pretty nice. It's a little complicated to set up, not bad though, if you have someone to help you it's good. I haven't been in an accident yet, so I haven't had the chance to use it- but there have been several close calls. With the buttons- it's a bit confusing, but it's easy to learn once you get the hang of it. The quality is nice, and I would say it's a trust worthy cam. Haven't installed the rear one in yet, but you will probably need someone else to help you install it unless you know your way around a car. Setting it up is decent, it's honestly great for the price, and I would say it's worth the money. It's not some super star dashcam, it's decent quality, and it works",

                "reviewText": "First I would like to say the dash cam works very well, haven't had any problems and the video quality is good but the compression is sometimes a bit much. However, the plates and such are still very readable so it checks off that. Next the accelerometer detection works very well and is configurable, this is pretty nice because this means the dash cam doesn't need to be connected to the battery for catching hit and runs. Lastly the only reason I have it a 4 star is because of the GUI/software is just clunky and the buttons do not align with the legend on the screen, however its very easy to learn what the buttons do.",

                "reviewText": "I recently installed the SUVCON 3 Channel Dash Cam in my car, and it has significantly upped my sense of security while driving. Here's what I love about it:360\u00b0 Coverage: This cam covers all angles - front, cabin, and rear - ensuring no blind spots. Whether I'm cruising down the highway or parked, I feel like I have an extra set of eyes around my car.G-Sensor Reliability: The G-sensor feature is a lifesaver. It automatically locks footage during sudden movements or impacts, which is incredibly reassuring, especially when I'm not around my car.Hassle-Free Loop Recording: It continuously records and overwrites old footage. The fact that it came with a 32GB card was a pleasant surprise, eliminating the need for immediate additional purchases.Night Vision Clarity: The night vision is crystal clear, capturing every detail even in low light. It's comforting to know that my night drives are as well recorded as day ones.Easy Setup: Installation was a breeze - a simple plug-and-play setup. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to operate, even for someone not very tech-savvy.In Summary: The SUVCON Dash Cam is an essential addition for any driver. It's like having a vigilant co-pilot, providing a comprehensive safety net with its wide coverage and smart features. For anyone looking to enhance their car's safety features, I highly recommend it.",
