I have 2 cams pointing out my side windows which other dash cams do not have this feature they have out the front and out the rear and or interior.

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Limited Compatibility and Functionality - A Disappointing Experience",
                "reviewText": "Rating: \u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606I purchased the Pruveeo Dash Cam Hardwire Kit with the expectation that it would keep my dash cam running even when my vehicle, a 2004-2008 Ford F150, was completely off. Unfortunately, my experience with this product was far from satisfactory, leading me to a 1-star rating.Issues Encountered: 1. Compatibility: The first major issue was compatibility. The kit is designed for specific types of fuse boxes, and unfortunately, mine was not one of them. The presence of multiple relays around the desired fuses in my fuse box rendered the provided tools useless. This was a significant oversight, as there was no disclaimer or warning about potential incompatibility with vehicles like mine. 2. Installation: What was supposed to be a DIY project turned into a need for professional installation. Despite this added expense and effort, the technician informed me that the kit did not work as intended. The dash cam would turn off along with the vehicle, defeating the purpose of the hardwire kit.Positive Aspects:Despite the issues, the concept of the kit is promising. If it were to work as advertised, it would indeed be an amazing addition to any compatible vehicle, providing continuous dash cam operation without draining the car battery.Product Quality:The kit\u2019s overall quality also left much to be desired. The sticky tabs meant to secure the wires were not only inadequate in number but also lacked the necessary adhesiveness, further complicating the installation process.Suggestions for Improvement: \u2022 Universal Compatibility: It\u2019s crucial for the kit to include a wider range of tools and connectors to ensure compatibility with all types of fuse boxes, especially those in common vehicles like the Ford F150. \u2022 Quality of Accessories: Enhancing the quality of the sticky tabs would greatly improve the user experience, ensuring secure and discreet wire placement.Final Thoughts:I can only recommend the Pruveeo Dash Cam Hardwire Kit to individuals who are certain of their vehicle\u2019s compatibility with the kit. The lack of clear compatibility information and the poor quality of installation accessories significantly undermine the product\u2019s value. Potential buyers should proceed with caution and perhaps look for alternatives that offer greater flexibility and reliability.",
