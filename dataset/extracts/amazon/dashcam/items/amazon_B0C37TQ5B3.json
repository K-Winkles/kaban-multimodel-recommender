                "reviewText": "Very pleased with my purchase. Actually, I bought two of them: one for myself and another one for my wife. Very well packed, light weight, compact and attractive appearance. Suctions cup holds very firmly on the windshield. Setup was a breeze; menu is user friendly and intuitive. The quality of the picture is very good, even at nighttime. Wi-Fi application works perfectly fine, was able to upload video files without any problems. If you take a snapshot and zoom it out you can easily read a license plate on the car in front of you. Glad that I have chosen a dash cam without SD card included. Instead, I bought high-capacity ultra speed SD 128 GB card just for $10. Camera starts recording as soon as you start the engine. USB cable very short, tried to use it to charge my cell phone - was very slow. Cigarette lighter car charger has no extra ports to charge a phone. Overall, pretty good quality and all you need to protect your car.",

                "reviewText": "Unfortunately I don\u2019t have a photo of the camera to provide as I bought it for my girlfriend for safety reasons so she has the camera. But it was rather quick and easy to set up and the clips that came with it were helpful as well. The camera screen is rather large for dash came which is nice. But the fact that it comes with an app to access the camera is even better, it is very clear when reviewing the footage and easy to access the videos. Just make sure to set the G sensor to low other wise it will save just about every video recorded and quickly fill up all the SD storage in a matter of days. I know because I experienced it. Other wise the camera works perfect and is worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good dashcam that is well-made and easy to install. The suction cup grips the glass like it's superglued. The picture quality is fine for such an inexpensive device. Very good value it seems to me. It is fitted with quite a long wire so that running it to the cigarette lighter is to problem. I'd buy it again and recommend it to anyone looking for a dashcam that's of good build and not crazy expensive.",

                "reviewText": "3 month update:The camera never gives off it's \"wifi\" signal anymore, meaning the app used to control the camera no longer works. I can't access videos through the app anymore, so if I needed to say, show a police officer video evidence of an accident, I wouldn't be able to do show it through my phone. You can still access the videos through a PC, but the point of the app is to be able to show someone, like a police officer, on the spot to prove yours or someone else's innocence.Another thing I learned after accessing the videos through my PC, the camera does not overwrite old videos the way you think it would. The camera saves every video until the storage is full, and then only overwrites the last video made. I had videos from when I first purchased the camera on September to the end of October, but nothing from the November, and the only video from December was my last minute of driving home just now. Utterly useless because it does not save a log of events, it just deleted the very last video made, so the minute before the most recent! What use is videos from 3 months ago when people rely on these in accidents that happen in the now?! USELESS!Luckily, I have not had to rely on this camera at all since purchasing, but heed my update as a warning. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!------------------------Video quality is pretty good. It's very easy to install and the suction cup is fairly strong. I keep mine under my rear view mirror. The power cord that comes with it comes pre wired to a cigarette lighter plug. I think it should have come with a USB cord instead so you can plug it into your computer.The only thing that loses this a star is the app for it. The app is terrible. It either crashes or does not want to connect to the camera and needs to be reset. As far as I can tell, you need the app to set the camera up.",

                "reviewText": "Had a really hard time finding a Dashcam in the under $50 range that check all my boxes. This was it. Two other brands i tested didn't work right out of the box. of the remaining units i tested, this unit had the best image quality (clear and bright, even in low light). Like that it worked great out of the box with out installation of any phone app. Full control using the screen and buttons (though an app is available to monitor, control, and download videos if you like). I'd rather just pop the SD card out and go directly to the computer. I'm sure you can get better image quality with a higher end camera, but for under $50, this one was impressive. Overall operation was straightforward and easy to get it to do what i wanted. My only complaint is the unit is too big (some folks may see that as a plus). For a Dashcam, i want small and unobtrusive, but enough screen and indicators to tell it is working. I'd recommend this unit.",

                "reviewText": "In short, I am very happy with the product. It was easy to install, just following the instructions which are written in good English. I especially loved the crank on the suction cup, never seen these before. Suction cups are usually a weak spot for windshield-mounted devices but this one works very well. Connecting to the phone was smooth. One thing I noticed later was that when the phone is connected to another WiFi network, the device would not connect to the phone. But, turning WiFi on the phone off and then back on solved the problem.I really love the ability to download the video and watch/show it right away without moving the card to a computer.In short, I find this device to be a great improvement over what I used to-date and a great value.",
