                "reviewText": "We bough this dash cam set from the merchant named \"the Biuone Store\" from Amazon on April 29, 2022, based on i) the needs to have a safety & tracking device for our young daughter's SUV; ii) 2652 verified reviews that rated them at 4.3 stars out of possible 5.Our acceptance criteria were: Costs, Functionalities, Engineering Excellence, Ease of Use, and Customer/Online Support. We have been very very pleased with our purchase:Cost: This Bioune set included 2 cameras for front and rear PLUS a 32 GB Micro SD Card! All for under $59 as compared to other, at least, 20 + cameras of equivalent functions available on Amazon that cost more.Functionalities: This camera set have all mission-critical functions such as Recording for both front & rear, Lock file, Play on demand, Looping processing, Motion Detection & Shock-activated Recording, Night Vision, HD photo & Video Quality (at very decent 1080P rating), Ability to set recording at Full time or Only-when-driving modes, 4 display options for front & rear cameras, PLUS all other standard functions like water proofing for the rear camera (have not tried to put the front to the water test yet as I mounted inside the vehicle for safety reason).Engineering Excellence: The front camera comes in at a very compact size in a very study PVC strengthened case with function buttons fully accessible with a slight touch. Electrical cable could be improved (our SUV is a long wheeled base one). But Customer Service Rep named Emma was so gracious and helpful! She gave us a free one to connect to the provided one that met our need. Otherwise, if you have an SUV like Land Cruiser, the one came with the set will be sufficient.Ease of Use: It did not take long for us to learn the camera set menu & buttons functionalities. After few iterations of operation sequences, we learned the camera logical pattern and use it with ease.Customer Support: We have not tried online so we can't rate this criteria. But we did contact the merchant and have been very satisfied with their support and focus attention. There is an assigned rep that worked with us from the beginning at point of purchase until we became satisfied after having received the extra free cable that they sent us from their home factory in China.Conclusion: While some may have different experiences, we are a happy customers and thought by sharing ours, folks can make decision for themselves in buying this dash camera set from this merchant Bioune Store.We are so glad that we have bough this set from this world-class merchant who went out of their way to delight their customers. We did not receive any compensation from having shared our review; we paid in full for this set.",

                "reviewText": "Background:I have never owned a dashcam or had any experience with one. I wanted to get one and didn't get to do my normal research before purchasing, but I added this one to my cart to remind me. Alexa notified me of an Amazon \"deal\" two days later, so I decided to jump on it for $40. I see now that it is still $40, so I'm not sure about the \"deal.\" Either way, it was worth a try for $40.Review:The camera itself is very light with a plasticky feel to it. The installation mount seems to be of higher quality than the camera. Installation was pretty simple. I wanted to do a hard-wire install to keep the wiring clean, but this product (as I suspect many others) runs on 5v (the USB standard) rather than 12v (the auto standard.) The instructions are clear (assuming you can read and understand terribly written English, as is the case with many guides written by non-native English speakers) to only use the supplied cigarette lighter plug to power the device. It does have an internal battery, but the directions are also clear that this is ONLY to provide a short time to complete a recording after the power is turned off. You MUST connect this camera to power to use it. It does NOT run on a rechargeable battery.I contacted the seller to inquire about a hard-wire option. They were extremely helpful and responsive (next-day replies that clearly responded to my inquiry.) They offered me their hard-wire install cable for free. (Well, purchase on Amazon and then they will credit back the purchase price.) This product is still waiting to be shipped and has been delayed once already. I decided to do a quick installation using the cigarette lighter plug so that I could determine if I would keep this dashcam before my 30-day Amazon return window closed.My 12v cigarette lighter plug is hot only while the car is on, and I think this is the only way this device will work automatically (turn on and record when the car is started, and stop recording and shut down when the car is turned off.) If you use an always-on accessory port in your car, you may need to turn it on/off and start/stop recording manually, or plug and unplug it with each use. I chose to NOT connect the rear-facing camera at this time since I don't want to end up re-routing any wiring if I need to reposition the front camera if/when I permanently install it.When installing the rear-facing camera, you have a CHOICE:1. Connect a wire to your backup light wire, which will activate the display when in reverse (like a backup camera,) but will NOT record video when doing so -or-2. Do NOT connect the wire, which will record video while reversing, but will NOT display on the screen while backing upReviews commenting on this should be interpreted as though they are commenting on the product's design and not on the product's \"failure,\" as this is clear in the instructions and in the Amazon description. (Again, you'll need to interpret this from broken English, but it should be clear.)(I also remember reading somewhere that if you use the rear-facing camera, you should set the resolution to 720 instead of 1080. The front cam is 1080, but the rear is only 720. I can't verify this setting now as I write this review.)There are also a few other settings recommendations in the manual to help avoid issues from arising:1. Motion detection - keep this off2. Shock/G sensor - keep this off to avoid auto-locking files, which will cause the memory card to fillThe included 32GB Micro-SD card is acceptable. You should get ~3hrs of video+audio from the front-facing camera at 1080 resolution. If you plan to connect the rear-facing cam and step-down to 720, frankly, I'm not sure if this will allow for more time or less. (I don't know if this cam creates separate files, or split-screen files when using both simultaneously.) Either way, it's enough to capture an \"event\" should you need to. Just make sure to stop recording to avoid having the file overwritten.The Micro-SD to USB adapter worked quickly when attached to my PC. Accessing the files for playback was fast and easy. Just open them in your default video player application right from the Micro-SD card. No special or proprietary software is needed. The files created are in MOV format.Video quality during the day is great. Not as good as a high-quality lens, but very clear.Video quality at night is barely acceptable. - Flare from approaching lights is very noticeable - Reflecting street signs are so bad you can't read them until you are right next to them and they are lit by the edges of your headlights - Lighted signs are unreadable (too bright as the camera attempts to deal with both very dark and very bright objects in the same scene) - Only areas directly hit by your headlights are visible; light falloff is drastic outside of your headlight coverage - Overall low-light recording is extremely poor and grainyThere may be other dashcams available at this price point. Overall, I would say that this is worth the $40 I spent trying it out. Assuming I get the hard-wired kit for free, the \"all-in\" price of $40 will be a little sweeter when this has a much cleaner installation. It's very nice that under \"normal\" installation, this product includes everything you need to use it, so there's nothing else to buy. (Cables, mount, Micro-SD card, SD reader.) But, if you do a lot of night driving, and high-quality night video is important to you, then I would consider looking at a more expensive dashcam.I'll update this review if anything changes over time.",

                "reviewTitle": "Excellent quality, easy to mount and easy to use. Would recommend for a budget dashcam solution!",
                "reviewText": "This camera looks really nice, doesn't look cheap, and the quality of the front camera is surprisingly really good! VERY clear. The rear camera could be better but I think it's not so important for the rear camera to be high quality, so it's definitely good enough, so I'm not so much as complaining about it, but would prefer a higher quality.As for installation, the included mounts make it very easy to install, and it's very easy to set up and to figure out how to use it.PRO TIP:When testing the camera, I was worried that the rear camera wasn't working, because they included a USB cable as well as the car lighter power cable. When using the USB cable in to a wall socket (to test the camera) the rear camera wouldn't work, then realized that maybe it's not receiving enough voltage. So when I went out and plugged it in to the car lighter socket, the rear camera worked perfectly! So just keep that in mind if you're testing the camera before installing, the rear camera requires the full voltage (which I assume is 12 volts) which can only be given through the car lighter plug. The USB cable in to a wall, usually only gives 5 volts.Other than that, this camera set up is excellent and would recommend it to anyone who wants a front and rear camera solution for an affordable price. EVEN if you only want a FRONT camera, it's still worth it, the front camera quality is honestly VERY good. I may try to attach another camera for the rear to see if I can get a better quality camera for the rear, but like I said, the rear camera's quality is good enough for it's use. You can still see clearly, but just not very far.",
