                "reviewText": "Good, inexpensive dash cam. Very easy to set up and get started for basic needs.I have a backup camera but I wanted a full time rear camera also in case of accident. The cord for the rear camera is NOT long enough to fully pass through (hidden) in our built out Ford Transit so for now the cord is just dangling. Ordered an extension to see if that works.But overall, easy to use once you play with it a bit. Like others said, directions are fine but hard to understand until you actually start messing with the camera functions. And you will need glasses...the font is tiny.I assume to get all 3 views on the screen at once, you have to tie the extra red cord into your existing electrical, which I am not doing. But I don't get all 3 camera views simultaneously on mine...only 2 at a time.The mount is not suction based, but rather a 3m tape so really not designed to move to different vehicles.",

He was cursing me out because I stopped (due to traffic moving too quickly for me to pull out).He was mad because I had a big Navigator with a trailer hitch and he ran into it. Zero damage to me, but it messed up his bumper.He kept getting in my face. I offered to call the cops and let them review my dashcam video, and suggested that with him being inebriated, it's just best he drive away, which he did.He knew he was at fault, and my video was evidence he couldn't fight. I had no damage, so it wasn't worth me pushing the issue.These things will help you when you need. And even if it's not you in an accident, maybe you can help someone else with your recording.I bought this for a grandson, and with the interior cab recording, he knows he needs his passengers to behave when they are driving somewhere, as this can be reviewed by his parents too.",

                "reviewText": "Terrible quality through and through. Claims to be a 4k camera and yet I've owned rocks that could give a better image quality. Straight out of the box this thing feels like a cheap hunk of junk. Not to mention the seller changed the item, so all the 5 star reviews on this page aren't even related to this dash cam. (Just read the reviews for yourself).The navigation is confusing, it is not user friendly at all. The image range is also nowhere near the advertised range. The camera facing inside the car to record passengers can barely even span across one seat in my car.Also, who puts the charging port ON THE TOP of the device, so that you have to bend the cable downwards in front of the camera lense in order to plug it in to charge?I just received this item today, and will be returning it today. I wouldn't even pay $5 for this dash cam.",
