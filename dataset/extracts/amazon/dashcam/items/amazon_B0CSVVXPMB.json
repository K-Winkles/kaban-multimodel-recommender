                "reviewText": "I was in the market for a dashcam as I recently bought a new car and wanted some extra insurance in case something were to go wrong. I had done a lot of digging for a dashcam and ultimately decided on either a 1440p or 4K dash cam. This goes without saying, 1080p simply isn't a good enough picture quality if you really want to be able to capture the entirety of your surroundings clearly. I have to say, it really has blown me away especially for the money. The picture is crystal clear and it functions perfectly at night as well. Everything gets saved to the app and you can easily retrieve footage through the app. This dash cam You really can't beat it at this price point, and it even comes with a high-quality original 32GB SD card, all for under $40. In the end, this is an absolute steal of a dashcam and the app is easy to understand. It's small and as long as you place it under your rear view mirror, it won't distract you at all. A must have for anyone on the road, regardless of whether your car is new or not.",

The resolution is 1440P which is better than standard HD cameras and will allow you to crop to get a larger image to retrieve a plate number, etc. without loosing too much image quality.Secondly, the installation is a simple affair, setting up the dash cam is a hassle-free process, taking approximately 10 minutes to complete. The accompanying mobile app, allows users to easily view and download recorded videos, enhancing convenience and accessibility. This integration with a mobile app simplifies video management and ensures a user-friendly experience.Furthermore, I particularly appreciate the voice broadcast working status feature. It provides real-time audio updates on the dash cam's operational status. This keeps me informed and reassured that everything is working as it should.Overall, this WiFi Dash Cam exceeds my expectations. Its compact design, robust materials, and advanced features make it an excellent choice for anyone in need of a reliable and convenient dash cam. I highly recommend it to fellow drivers.",

The unit is small, lightweight, and allows for an expandable micro SD card allowing you to record many hours worth of video without overwriting old footage. The unit is unobtrusive, mounts easily, and does what it claims to do. It will automatically record video on a loop and store those on the SD card until its full, or files are deleted, and will automatically begin overwriting old clips once full. The app is easy to connect and allows full control over the unit's settings. As long as you're OK with having the device plugged into a 12v outlet, then I recommend this device. 5 stars!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this dashcam for only a couple of days now, but i am blow away with how this $39 works and compares to $79+ dash cams.For starters, out of the box it seems well made, its a solid little unit, it doesnt feel like cheap plastic, and it looks quite sleek and stylish.The setup i recommend you do before you install the camera as it makes it easier to fiddle around with the buttons on the dash cam and setting it up on your phone. The WiFi-mobile app control feature is a game-changer. I can easily connect my smartphone to the dash cam and conveniently preview and review recorded videos whenever I want. It's incredibly handy to modify the working parameters of the dash cam right from my phone as well. This level of control adds a new level of convenience to my driving experience.The video quality itself is amazing, I still cannot believe how incredible this dash cam is for the cost. The image is crisp, clear, you can read license plates and make out faces from a good distance away.It even came with a free 32gb SD card! Seriously, all of this for $39??Its an amazing dashcam at a fraction of the price. I love it!",

The ability to use Wi-Fi to download the videos is very convenient.Overall worth the price and I would defiantly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the E-YEEGER 2.5K Car Camera, and I must say I'm quite impressed with its performance and features. Here's my detailed review:**Video Quality (4/5):** The 2.5K resolution provides sharp and clear video footage. Daytime recording is excellent, capturing license plates and road details with ease. Night vision is also commendable, though it could be slightly better in extremely dark conditions.**Ease of Installation (5/5):** Setting up this dash cam was a breeze. The included 32GB SD card is a nice addition. The user-friendly app makes it easy to configure settings and view recordings.**Durability (4/5):** The build quality seems sturdy, and the camera feels well-made. It has held up well in various weather conditions, but long-term durability remains to be seen.**Features (4/5):** The E-YEEGER dash cam is packed with features. The G-sensor automatically locks and saves footage during an accident, ensuring crucial evidence is preserved. Loop recording is seamless, and the 24-hour parking mode is a great security feature. The support for up to 256GB SD cards is a huge plus.**App Integration (4.5/5):** The app allows you to easily access and manage your recordings, making it convenient to review footage on your smartphone.In summary, the E-YEEGER 2.5K Car Camera is a reliable choice for those seeking a feature-rich dash cam. While it excels in most areas, there's room for minor improvements in night vision quality. Overall, it's a great investment for your safety and peace of mind while driving.",

The mini and hidden design of the Dash Cam allows for an unobstructed view while driving. However, it is important to note that this Dash Cam does not have a built-in lithium battery. One of the main factors that influenced my decision to purchase this Dash Cam was its 1-year warranty and 30-day full refund.Installation:The installation process is straightforward. The dash cam comes with a long enough cable to run behind the roof liner, A-pillar, and under the glove box to the console. The USB cable has a USB-C end, which attaches to the camera, and the other end is a 12V Cigarette Lighter Plug. However, it would have been better if they had provided a separate USB-C to USB-A connector so that users could use their existing multiple-port USB cigarette lighter outlet.Operation:Navigating the camera itself is easy once you read the manual. You need to use an app called VeeCar to view recorded videos. The camera connects to your phone via Wi-Fi. The recording loop can be set between 1/2/3 minutes.Picture Quality:The picture quality is good but not exceptional. Although the video resolution is decent, I don't think it is 4K quality when viewed through my phone. However, considering the price of this camera, it is hard to beat.Overview:This is an affordable Dash Cam that comes with a 1-year warranty and a 30-day full refund, which is a great option. The video quality is good enough to provide evidence when you need it. Although it has some drawbacks, I would still recommend this Dash Cam.",
