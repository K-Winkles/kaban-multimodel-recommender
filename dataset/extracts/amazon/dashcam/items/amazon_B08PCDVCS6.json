                "reviewText": "I was surprised this showed up as quickly as it did. USPS gave no updates from the time the label was created, but was in my hands 4 days after I ordered it!I got this to wire my dashcam in my 2018 Subaru Outback Premium with Homelink and without eyesight. Upon opening the box, I wasn't sure if I got the right part since it didn't look like the part on the listing, and didn't look like the picture on the box... but it appeared to all be intact.Dropping the map light console takes about 3 seconds, and the connector for the mirror was right there. I was able to plug in the adapter very easily, and with having the separate power cord, was able to hook it up and run the wiring easily. My camera uses a USB mini B cord, which was included with the packaging (as well as the cords for USB Micro B and USB C connectors). Each cord was about 8\", which gives some good flexibility to be able to hide wires easily.Before closing everything up, I tested the power by turning on the engine and my camera powered up flawlessly.Overall, il very happy with this adapter. Took about 10 minutes total to fully install and test out, and no longer need to have a power cable running up the A pillar to use my dashcam! Highly recommend!",

Ran the cable under the auto-diming mirror wire harness cover that runs from the auto-dimming mirror mounting (on the windshield) up into the overhead console. Check out available videos for installation. My auto-dimming mirror was factory installed and required the 5-pin connector.",

                "reviewText": "The connector matches with my 2020 Forester Limited. I was able to plug it in with no issue. However, there was no USB power. Upon looking closer at the adapter, I noticed that the power uses the middle wire and one next to it. In my vehicle there is no middle wire from the car entering the harness. So either the ground or the 12V Acc is missing. Perhaps this works with previous years, or maybe a different trim level, but not in ours.",
