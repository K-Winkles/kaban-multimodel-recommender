Everything works perfectly until we attempt to set up the parking and collision modes. The dashboard cam displays a message of \"Please make sure that the device is connected to the 3-Lead Hardware Kit.\"I've checked all the connections to make sure they're secure. I've validated that the constant fuse relay is always active at the right amp level. Ground is grounded. The alternate connection is connected to the cig / usb connector. Even made sure I clamped down on the connectors. Doesn't seem to be a problem there.Car Information: 2015 Toyota Venza LX (constant on is fog light) (alternate is cog/usb connector).Neither Amazon Tech Support nor I could figure out how to factory reset the device.Please advise,Ken H.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------support - Jan 7, 2024, 8:01 PM (4 days ago)to Ken H.Hi friendhardwire kit we sincerely hope that you could ask help from local professionalhad many customers happen issue when they install it by themself and solve it by professioanl help\"Please make sure that the device is connected to the 3-Lead Hardware Kit.\" mean that you don't install it correctly.any questions pls feel free to contact ussupportsupport@ombars.com\u7b7e\u540d\u7531 \u7f51\u6613\u7075\u7280\u529e\u516c \u5b9a\u5236---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ken H. - Jan 7, 2024, 8:38 PM (4 days ago)to supportHello Support,Not quite the support response I was expecting and what I read on Amazon.

I went to Car Toys to have them professionally troubleshoot the problem with the Hardwire Kit and the camera. The receipt and Tech write-up are attached.Results:1. I wired the Hardware Kit correctly (Ground, Battery, and Alternate)..2. Problem: The connectors in the Hardwire Kit were not soldered correctly. This caused the error of the 3-wire issue being displayed on the camera.3. The technician also believes there still could be a problem with the camera, it shuts off for no reason and/or freezes up for no reason. Before asking, he wants me to test it for a couple of days to confirm. I'll test for a week and provide feedback.I would like a refund for the Hardwire Kit as that was a problem. If possible, I would like a credit for the Car Toy charges I paid to validate a problem with the Hardwire Kit I need your assistance with correcting.Regards,Ken H.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------support - Jan 8, 2024, 9:24 PM (3 days ago)to Ken H.Hi friendso many thanks for your patiencewe could provide total refund for the hardwire kit by Amazon, pls share your order number, we will arrange the refund asap when we get your information.thankssupportsupport@ombars.com\u7b7e\u540d\u7531 \u7f51\u6613\u7075\u7280\u529e\u516c \u5b9a\u5236------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ken H. - Jan 8, 2024, 9:45 PM (3 days ago)to supportThank you.
