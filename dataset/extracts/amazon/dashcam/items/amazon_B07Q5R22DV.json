                "reviewText": "TL;DR, I would happily recommend this dash cam!!I've been using it for just over a year now and I'm still very happy with it. The power cord did stop working about a month ago, but I contacted the sellers and they were incredibly responsive and willing to help. I received a brand new power cord within a couple of weeks - tracked & free of charge. Amazing customer service; I would recommend this product for this experience alone.As far as the camera itself goes, I'd say it's good value for money. It was pretty easy to set up; I have it so the rear camera is inside my car taped to the top of the rear windscreen (I couldn't connect it to my brake lights like this, so I can't use the parking function...but I don't really care about that since I can use the rear camera to look behind me anyway). The mount for the camera has only fallen from my front windscreen once in my entire time using it, plus I don't find it to block my vision while driving. Additionally, the wires are plenty long enough to allow you to run them along the sides of your car and have them not be stretched out or in the way (for reference, I have a Peugeot 206 and I still had several arm lengths of wire left after setting up the rear camera).The menu is fairly simple to navigate. The video and audio quality isn't particularly great, but it does the job just fine. I do find that, at night, bright headlights close behind me completely whites out the image, but I'll take that over having the camera outside the car as intended. The image is fine if cars are the correct distance away from you and the glass is clean. I have the recording set to loop every 2 minutes and I found that, with a 32GB micro SD card (which doesn't come with the camera), I can store roughly and hour and a half's worth of clips at once. I now have a hilarious/scarily large collection of clips showing the bad drivers I've come across while recording that I can laugh/cringe at. Having a dash cam brought my car insurance down a little as well. Would 100% recommend.",
