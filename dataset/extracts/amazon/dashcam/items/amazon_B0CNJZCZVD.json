If you need to use the 24h parking monitoring function, you need to connect the Dash Cam to an external power supply. \u2714\ufe0f3-Lead Hardware Kit is required here, which is not included in the package. And all the sellers of the dashcam do not provide this accessory, but you can contact the after-sales mailbox in our manual, and we will help you solve it. 2. Because some brands of new cars do not have a cigarette lighter, but now the dash cam industry generally uses a cigarette lighter as a charging port, because it is more stable. \u2714\ufe0fIn order to solve the problem of no cigarette lighter, you can contact our after-sales mailbox on the manual, we will give you a solution. \u00b7 Warm Tips: 1. A high-speed 64G SD card we presented as a gift, which is specially customized by a cooperative manufacturer, has been placed in the package. And please format it when first use: Find the option of \u201cFormat\u201d in dashcam and click \u201cOK\u201d button. 2. Our S7 dashcam are made of aircraft-grade aluminum alloy, which is not only resistant to high temperature but also to low temperature, maintaining good stability and durability even in harsh environments. Working Environment: Operating Temprature: -31\u00b0F (-35\u00b0C) ~ 176\u00b0F (80\u00b0C); Working Humidity: 5-95% 3. Without connecting the car charger, even if the battery of dash cam is fully charged, it will turn off automatically within 1 minute. It's not a battery problem, it's an automatic shutdown set by the system to save power for the purpose of recording video in emergency. All dash cams on the market are like this, please don't worry about the battery. \u2714\ufe0fPlease always keep the dash cam plugged into the car's cigarette lighter to achieve the continuous operation of the dash cam. 4. Before inserting or removing the micro SD card, please be sure to turn off the power of the dashcam to avoid data loss. 5. When you need to access the menu settings, first press the OK button to stop video recording. 6. When you turn the car's engine ignition on/off, the S7 car camera will automatically turn on/off, which is a normal phenomenon. But if the dashcam keeps turning off and on, check if the adapter is connected well or try a new one. Then format the micro SD Card and restore factory settings in the menu.",

                "reviewText": "I recently saw a video on youtube that showed an accident that happened where neither party admitted they were at fault. Luckily for one driver, he had a dashcam that recorded the accident and it was clear that the other driver ran a red light. Without the dashcam, it would have been more difficult to prove who was at fault. I feel like I didn't want to chance something like this happening to me so I started researching dashcams.There are many models and features to choose from. I mainly wanted something easy to use and the video quality that will be high enough quality to tell what happened in case of an accident.Setting up the camera is pretty easy, just plug it into the cigarette lighter 12V outlet and it starts recording. Of course, I wanted to hide the wires, so I used the little tool provided to wedge the wires in the upholstery of the car. It looks pretty clean and professional. It took me about 45 minutes to install the rear camera and hide all the wires.There are many options including automatic HDR, G sensor, and time date stamp.Here's my take:Pros:1. Includes front and rear video cameras2. Large easy to see screen3. Quality mounting hardware - the suction cup is especially of nice quality4. Includes everything needed to install and hide the wires.5. Good image quality for the front camera 1600p6. Includes 64GB memory card7. Very good price for the quality of the cameraCons:1. The rear camera resolution is 1080p. This is pretty standard in most dual camera dashcams but something to keep in mind.2. Can't speak to the longevity since I've only had this for a short timeTLDR - If you're looking for a best bang for the buck front and rear dashcam, you can't beat this one.",
