                "reviewText": "I recently installed the dual dash camera in my car, and it's been an absolute game-changer for my daily commutes and long-distance travels. This compact device offers crystal-clear footage from both the front and rear cameras, ensuring full coverage around my vehicle. The setup was straightforward, and the camera's interface is user-friendly.The video quality, both during the day and at night, is impressive, capturing details with precision. The wide-angle lenses provide extensive coverage without distortion. Moreover, the parking mode feature adds an extra layer of security while I'm away from my car.The only drawback I've noticed is the battery life when operating in parking mode for extended periods without a power source. However, considering the peace of mind and protection it offers, this is a minor issue.Overall, this dual dash camera is a reliable witness on the road, offering both safety and security. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their driving experience.",

                "reviewText": "My husband and I have been seeing a lot of videos online and reading articles about scams happening on the road like people jumping in front of cars, people slamming carts into cars and purposely causing accidents for insurance fraud. So, a dash cam was on top of our Christmas wish list. Plus, our car is older and does not have a back up rear camera so a dash cam with a back up camera would be ideal.After searching Amazon for a few months, we decided to try this one and are so glad we did!Key Positives* Video quality - the video quality is extremely wide and very clear and sharp. They aren\u2019t kidding when they say 8k.* Memory card - We were surprised this dash cam came with a 32GB memory card. Other dash comes sell this separately which can be frustrating.* Easy set up - Set up was extremely easy. I set up the front camera without looking at the manual while my husband was driving. The rear camera was set up separately in minutes.* Stays on the dash - We live in Southern CA where the harsh sun beats down on our cars. The dash cam has stayed on without budging. The adhesive is strong!* Compact design - I like that the camera is relatively small and sleek. It does not distract the driver from seeing.",
