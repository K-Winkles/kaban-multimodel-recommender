                "media_text": "FREQUENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q: Does it have built-in GPS? A: At present, this 2K dash camera does not have GPS. Please carefully read the product description on Amazon's website when purchasing. Q: Why does this dash camera suddenly turn on and then shut down when the car engine is turned off and the doors are opened/closed? A: This is because you have activated the parking mode. When the car is turned off and in the parking state, the vibration of opening/closing the car door is recognized as a car collision. This will automatically turn on and record emergency videos before turning off. If you really don't like this, we suggest that you turn off the parking mode. However, please note that if parking mode is turned off, once your car is hit during parking, it will not automatically start up to retain important evidence. Q: Does the package include the front snd rear dash camera? Does the dashcam have an inside camera? A:Yes, currently this 2K dash cam comes with the front and rear dashcam. Please be particularly careful not to include the inside camera. Please carefully read the packaging description of this 2K dash cam with wifi on Amazon's website when purchasing. Q: Why is the suction cup mount not sticky? How can I install and fix it to the windshield? A:This suction cup mount itself is not sticky and is mainly fixed to the windshield by turning the twist knob of the suction cup mount to \"lock\". If you still do not understand how to fix the suction cup mount, please refer to the manual. Q: Do I have to connect to WiFi to use and operate this 2K+720P dash cam? A:No, absolutely not, this dashcam can connect to the app via wifi to play back videos and manage settings. When the dashcam is in normal recording state, the blue indicator flashes once per second to indicate that it is recording. You can play back the video directly on the dashcam, or insert the card of the dashcam into the card reader and then connect it to a PC to play back the video. Q:Does this 2K dash cam with wifi require the purchase of additional hardware? A: No, absolutely not. This 2K dash cam with WiFi does not require the purchase of additional hardware kits to support parking mode. In fact, this dash cam comes with parking monitor (default off). If you want to turn on parking mode, you need to click the menu button when the dash cam is stopped recording and go to the settings to find [Parking Monitor] to turn it on. Some friends may have been prompted by the app's settings to purchase additional hardware for parking mode, but in reality, it is not necessary. We will fix this error in the app in the near future.",
