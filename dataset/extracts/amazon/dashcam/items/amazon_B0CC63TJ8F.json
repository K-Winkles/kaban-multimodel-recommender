                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the POFOTO Dash Cam, and it has completely transformed my driving experience. This little device is a game-changer for road safety!First and foremost, the video quality is exceptional. The POFOTO Dash Cam captures crystal-clear footage in high definition, ensuring that every detail on the road is recorded accurately. Even in low-light conditions, the camera performs remarkably well, providing a clear image of the surroundings.One of the standout features of this dash cam is its wide-angle lens. It offers an impressive field of view, allowing me to capture not only what's happening directly in front of my vehicle but also what's happening on the sides. This wide coverage ensures that I have evidence of any incidents or accidents from multiple angles.The POFOTO Dash Cam's loop recording feature is another aspect that I love. With loop recording, I never have to worry about running out of storage space. The camera automatically overwrites the oldest footage when the memory card is full, so I can keep recording without interruption.Setting up the POFOTO Dash Cam was a breeze. The instructions were clear and easy to follow, and the mounting system was sturdy and secure. The device itself is compact and discreet, blending seamlessly with my car's interior without obstructing my view.All in all, the POFOTO Dash Cam is an exceptional device that I highly recommend to all drivers. It offers top-notch video quality, a wide field of view, and essential features like loop recording and a G-sensor. With this dash cam, I feel safer on the road, knowing that I have solid evidence in case of any incidents. Don't hesitate \u2013 invest in the POFOTO Dash Cam today and experience peace of mind like never before!Disclaimer: This review was written based on my personal experience and opinion. Individual results may vary.",

                "reviewText": "I rented a new car while mine was in the shop and enjoyed the proximity alerts and the front and rear camera view, especially when backing up. So I decided to get one for my SUV. I like having both the front and rear cameras and love how compact they are; they are fairly unobtrusive in both locations. The front camera is mostly behind the rear-view mirror (the camera is small enough to easily fit entirely behind the mirror).The rear camera is tucked up at the top of the rear window (just at the top of the rear wiper sweep area) and is barely noticeable. I liked that I could rotate the rear camera in its holder to the view angle I wanted.The video quality looks great. I set my front resolution down to 1080p since I feel that will be sufficient for our day-to-day needs. In my opinion, the quality of the footage will be impacted more by how clean the glass is and the weather conditions outside than the quality of the cameras.The included lighter adaptor worked great. You can get the hardwire kit to run permanently and to enable Parking Mode.I also got an additional mount so I could mount the camera a bit higher behind the rear-view mirror. I'll use the suction mount and lighter adaptor when using the dashcam on trips in a rental car (to record my trips).You'll need to get a U3 Class 10 SD card with a capacity of 32GB - 256GB. This is how to hardwire the camera to have parking mode. ,(the way it's listed in the manual was not very informative..\u25aa1: Connect wires as described above (Yellow = constant 12v, Red = switched 12v, Black = ground).\u25aa2: Turn on acc power (but do not start engine).\u25aa3: Press menu button and select \"Parking\".\u25aa4: While blue message box is shown on the F7N display, turn off acc power (this has to be timed well). You should see a new blue message box and the F7N unit will power off.\u25aa5: Turn acc power back on (but do not start engine).\u25aa6: Press menu button and select \"Parking\".\u25aa7: You will now see the menu options for Parking Mode and be able to configure it how you like.After reversing my wire connections back to match the documentation and following the steps above, my hardwired dashcam is now functioning perfectly - including Parking Mode.Even though my installation and set-up experience with the hardwire kit wasn't ideal. I do have to say that the POFOTO customer service was outstanding! They were responsive, proactive, and empowered to do the right things for their customers.As for the apps, the Android app seems to work sufficiently well..I was surprised to discover that the rear camera records audio, so it doesn't sound great when both front and rear audio are played at the same time. I muted the rear audio and used just the front audio.The video files run just fine on third-party video players.Bottom line: I love the dashcam and rear camera; easy to use; good video; absolutely fabulous customer service.",

                "reviewText": "If you are a safe driver then you need a dash cam. It's a crazy world and having video evidence could be a lifesaver.My last dashcam had a robust app and a lot of bells and whistles, most of which I did not use. When looking for a dashcam replacement video quality, built-in GPS, and easy of use were the most important factors. The Pofoto was not a brand I was familiar with, but it touted high quality video, two cameras, and GPS so I took a chance.Now with a few weeks of use so far I am happy. I'll list the pros and cons below.Pros: \ud83d\ude03+ Easy to set-up and simple app to use.+ Excellent video quality, both daytime and night.+ Has a rear-view camera.+ Wide-screen on camera for easy viewing.+ Camera adjusts easily on the ball mount.+ Camera removes easily for storage.+ Uses newer USB-C connector.+ Camera starts and stops recording automatically when my SUV is started and stopped.+ Has small unobtrusive LED indicating the camera is recording.+ Built-in GPS so speed and location is recorded.Cons: \ud83d\ude10- App is clunky and shows no signs of being updated.- Logging into the dashcam requires several clicks on the app.- No Micro-SD card is included.- Camera removal from mount was a little difficult at first.At first I thought the cons might be a deal breaker, however they turned out to be mostly non issues.* Micro-SD cards are very inexpensive and the ones that come with most cameras are low quality.* After a few uses the camera now removes from the mount easily.* Now the camera is set-up it starts recording automatically when I start my SUV, I don't use the app. Plus I'm sure there will be firmware updates coming.So far so good, I'll update this review if I experience any issues. \ud83d\ude03",
