                "reviewText": "This Flyneei F10 3-channel dashcam is pretty poor. The front camera is quite poor in daytime and night. The cabin and rear cameras have a narrow field of view so don't capture much.The front camera has a decent wide-angle view and would capture wrecks in the front and who was at fault, but little more. License plates are only readable when right in front or to the side, otherwise they're blurry. Even street signs are hard to read until they're right next to you. This is very poor performance for a 1080p camera. Taking a photo in the camera at maximum resolution it's clear the camera is not 1080p, probably 720p.Night time performance is also poor, though it does pick up low light decently, and you can see the street under just streetlights or headlights. As with daytime, it would capture another vehicle impacting you in the front. License plates are unreadable even if right behind the vehicle (due to over-exposure). Blurriness seems even worse due to halos around bright things. There is no wide dynamic range.The mic pickup is decent, in case you need to verbally read out a plate or make a comment.The interior camera has such a narrow field it doesn't capture much of anything. The windshield mount doesn't even allow turning the camera enough to capture the driver's face, and of the back seat it only shows the center bit between the front seats. Its night vision is good, capturing things in pitch dark.The rear camera's field of view is also narrow, so it would only capture a small field of things happening right behind the car. It might still help determine fault if someone rear-ended you, though.Video is stored in an archaic MJPG encoding (AVI file), which gives poor quality for the space used. This limits how far back you can go in recordings.",

I feel safer knowing that everything that happens in the front, rear and inside my vehicle is being recorded. All 3 cameras have a wide panoramic view in all directions that gives you almost a full 360 degrees view. So you can capture everything going on all around you including the sidewalk. You can set the screen to split the view to show all 3 cameras on the screen at the same time or set it to show 2 views or just 1 camera view.I took away 1 star because you have to buy the additional hardwire kit to use the 24hr. motion detector car monitoring function and the manufacturers suggested you only use a 32gb memory card for the best performance of this dash cam and I would prefer to have more memory capability in case I need to go back and see what happened last week. However, the recorder will automatically loop and record over old footage when the 32gb is full. OVERALL I AM HAPPY WITH THIS ITEM.",

                "reviewText": "OK, this was a free product via Amazon Vine. Biggest issue I had, that would make me consider other options, is the difficulty making out license plates, especially at night. The purpose of the camera is to record a traffic incident, if the other party speeds away and you aren't really able to get the license plate, that's a bit of a problem. I don't have another similar camera to test it against, but this max'es out at 1080p, I would lean towards something higher-res.There are 3 cameras, however the one facing you is fixed, you will not be in frame unless you turn the entire device towards you. I preferred to have it sit on the other side of the rear-view mirror, to avoid distracting me while driving, but that mean the reverse camera only saw an empty seat. Personally I never tried the 3rd camera, didn't want to fuss with all the wires hanging in my car.To be fair, if you insist on a 3-camera setup, this package makes that possible at an affordable price. Won't be the best quality but it works. Also the camera is very very light, no problem with any suction or dropping from the mount.I fully understand that high-quality cams might cost double, even triple of this item, however it seems like an investment that is worth it. If you get in a traffic accident, you are potentially facing thousands, or even tens of thousands, of dollars in liability, replacement, investigation and injury costs. You will want the maximum proof of exactly what happened and who's fault it was, at that point I think you'd wish you had spent an extra $100 to get a better-quality camera with more detail and definition.",

                "reviewText": "Out of the dash cams out there, this is one of the nicer ones. It has all three channels. That means in front of the car, inside the car, and behind the car. It comes in the box with everything you need to install it. Installation is a breeze, the hardest part is hooking up the rear view camera, and even that is simple. Once it's installed, it is ready to go with very little setup. It has all the same options as most dash cams, including parking monitor, and g sensor, which are the two most important probably. The camera Works great, picture is clear and easy to see. It saves to the SD card automatically in case you need the tape for evidence. Overall it's a great device for the price, highly recommended.",
