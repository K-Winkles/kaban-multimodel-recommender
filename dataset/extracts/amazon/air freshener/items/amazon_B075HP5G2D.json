I put it together according to the directions, but it never showed the blue light. I decided it had to be the batteries, so I put three new batteries in and it worked fine. I thought it might just have been that one of the original batteries was dead so I exchanged the old and the new until the blue light went on and the mist came out. So it turned out that one of the original batteries was dead. But otherwise, it's a great idea and I'm looking forward to sleeping more soundly now that there'll be fresh scents floating around my bed.",

                "reviewText": "I admittedly don\u2019t write good reviews often, I usually only take my time if I need to tell people how bad a product is. I don\u2019t usually go out of my way to tell people how great a product is but listen, buy this. You need it.I\u2019m BIG on home fragrance. I\u2019ve definitely wasted a lot of money on things that didn\u2019t work. I use wax melts, incense sticks, candles, wall plug ins, sprays, etc. We recently shampooed our carpets and it unfortunately brought up old pet smells that we are now having to tackle. But my whole living room and kitchen area smelt like a\u2026 excuse me\u2026 pile of dog s***. It was absolutely disgusting and while in the process of trying to fix the smell in the carpet, I\u2019ve been lighting candle after candle, wax melts, sprays, you name it and I did it. But you could still smell the awful smell. I saw this oil diffuser while doing my Amazon fresh order and figured why not try it? I\u2019ve been let down by at least 5 oil diffusers so why not give another a try. It came with the batteries it needed and a bottle of oil. Super easy to start up and use. I put it on the lowest setting and placed it by my front door. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to work well so I figured if it works at all, at least let it work where people are entering my home so they\u2019re greeted by something a little more pleasant than my carpet.Shortly after turning it on I had to leave and came back about an hour later and you guys, my house smells amazing. My whole front area. I have a fairly small house but my living room/kitchen area is about half of my home and this whole area smells amazing! And maybe I\u2019ve become a bit nose blind in the last 2 days since the smell resurfaced from my carpet but I can no longer smell it.I cannot recommend this product enough!",

The little bottles are real easy to replace, though they could last longer. Of course, I manually goose mine to get a hit of scent any time I'm near the thing, so...See, this particular scent (Lavendar and Almond Blossom) makes me irrationally happy. I just love it. Maybe you will too, maybe not. The only other scent I've tried is one labeled as \"Happy\", which is pleasant enough, citrus/peach sorta, but pales in comparison to Lavendar and Almond Blossom, the single best air freshener scent ever made, for me anyway.",

Then I saw this product - which is very affordable and decided to give it a go. I am very happy I did! I have tried five scents so far and they are all gorgeous! The smell is quite potent so I just turn on the machine when I want to freshen up a room. Let it run for maybe an hour, then shut it off again and the room smells great again. It does gobble up batteries pretty good, so I find this to be a good compromise to letting it just run day and night. A great little buy in my opinion. Give it a try. :)",

                "reviewText": "The smell is okay, although it does smell more chemical than natural if you are near it when it discharges.The don't last long. The bottles/refills are not full, and the portion that absorbs the liquid does not reach the bottom of the bottle, so it's not efficient is getting all the liquid out. They were supposed to last for 45 days on low. I get closer to 30. And they burn through batteries like crazy. It would be best to use rechargeable, as I change the batteries almost as much as I change the fragrance bottles.But the worst: The timer makes no sense for working from home. It's on 8 hours, off 16. There is no way to change that. If I work an 8 hour shift, I have about 1 hour before and 7 hours after. Meaning only 50% of my day is covered by this. 8 hours off, when I'm asleep and don't need it, would make more sense. The only way to accommodate might be to maybe have 2 side-by-side, and have them cycle? But hardcoding the timer feels like a flaw where there should have been adjustable. If I could do half stars, this would be closer to a 3.5. It's just \"okay\".",
