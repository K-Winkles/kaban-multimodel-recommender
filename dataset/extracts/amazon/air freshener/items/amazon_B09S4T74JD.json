From the moment I opened them, the fresh scent was strong (in a good way) and was very noticeable for the first few days. If you have any issues with fragrance sensitivity, these might be too much for you.The fresh scent lasted over a month and outlasted other fresheners we had used. They are also just the right size to hide away in a bathroom or near the litter box without being too visible.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Berry and Bramble scent July 11th and I've already burned through the 4 pack (Aug. 9th, technically the week before that but I hadn't gotten around to writing this review until now), so definitely did not last the 45 days they advertised (and I'm assuming its 45days for 1). The scent was great, I love it, it wasn't too strong and it was just a great smell. The problem is that they don't last long, at least in areas that you have more air movement like say with a fan or A/C blowing on it. I use these to help combat the smell of cigarettes so I have 1 on the nightstand next to my bed and one on my office desk. It's summer so I have a fan blowing which is constantly hitting the air freshener. It's the only thing I can think of that helped contribute to how quickly I burned through all 4 air fresheners, considering I also bought the Unstoppables air fresheners for the bathroom and they are still almost completely full. The difference is that they are in areas that don't get a lot of air flow or at least not nearly as much as the ones I have in the office and bedroom.I bought these because I don't have an outlet that allows for the plug in air fresheners which I love and have in another bathroom of the house because the outlets I have are sideways which doesn't work for those air fresheners. So I thought these would be a great alternative. Scent wise it was great, but if I'm going to burn through 4 in a months time during the summer it's hard to justify buying.",
