                "reviewText": "This is the finest room/linen/air freshener we have tried. The pump always works well - without clogs, failure, or fault.The Rosewater scent was instantly a hit at our house - and although they are all worth trying, this one is my fav so far.These bottles seem expensive - but they do last a very long time, despite our habit to overspray most of the time we use it!Very nice scent - not thick or overpowering - but just the perfect spirit of mist - freshening up - without overkill or obvious masking out.We give it a thumbs up across the board!",
