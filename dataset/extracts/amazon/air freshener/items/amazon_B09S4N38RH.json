                "reviewText": "I bought this product that says \u201csmall spaces\u201d thinking it would be great for my slightly above-average size bathroom. It smelled good and definitely worked well, BUT I would not say it\u2019s for small spaces. The smell was so strong that within a couple hours, my entire house smelled VERY strongly of the scent, so much so that I decided to move it to my garage instead. My garage has kept its strong scent now for about a month so far. So\u2026great product, but not necessarily for small spaces (unless you like really strong smells).",

Only downside is when you first open a new one, the smell can be super overwhelming\u2026.luckily that only lasts for approx 12hrs or so. After that it\u2019s a perfectly even, subtle fresh laundry scent\u2026.perfect for closets, bathrooms/powder rooms, really any space that could use a nice fresh scent. Not sure how long one lasts yet as this is my first one and I only opened on July 16, 2021 so we\u2019ll see. So far though I\u2019m absolutely in LOVE with these!!! Plus the price is way cheaper than if bought in store (if you can even find them)",
