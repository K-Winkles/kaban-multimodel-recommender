                "reviewText": "Decided to try these toilet pods to keep things fresh and blue in the bowl. Here's the scoop after giving them a go.Pros:- They do exactly what's promised\u2014turn the toilet water a nice blue and leave a pleasant smell.- While they may not last an eternity, the quality during their effectiveness is top-notch.- Perfect for concealing stains, especially with well water. Some stubborn stains persist, but the blue water helps mask them.- Last longer than other brands I've tried, providing a decent duration of effectiveness.- Pleasant smell without an overpowering color, and they seem to last longer due to this balance.- Clear and straightforward instructions make placing the tablets in the tank a breeze, requiring a 30-60 minute wait for optimal results.Cons:- The longevity might not be the strongest suit, so if durability is a priority, exploring other options could be wise.- While they help maintain a reasonably clean bowl, they won't replace the occasional need for manual scrubbing.- Color release might be less vibrant with shorter intervals between flushes, but this seems to contribute to a longer-lasting effect.Additional Thoughts:Overall, a solid choice for toilet maintenance. I will definitely be ordering more of these. Hope this review helped!",

                "reviewText": "The Vacplus Automatic Toilet Bowl Cleaner Tablets provide convenience but have limitations. While they effectively clean and deodorize, the scent might be strong. The tablets last for a considerable period, yet results can vary based on water conditions. Each tablet last mainly for 2-3 weeks and can leave clumps at the end making the toilet bowl dirty but can be flushed to remove.",
