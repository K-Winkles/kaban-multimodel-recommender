                "reviewText": "Thank you dear product developers! This French Lavender and Honey Blossom is a hit!I will tell you honestly. I quit buying Air Wick refills altogether. A couple of years ago, the company quietly discontinued the Lavender and replaced it on the shelf with (an almost identically packaged) and awful smelling (IMHO) Lavender and Chamomile. It smelled like cheap cologne, that hit my olfactory sharply when I entered a room with a warmer. But, I digress.I will say, the new scent is not as beloved to MY olfactory as the old Air Wick Lavender, or the even the Lavender and Vanilla, that I have been using in it's absence.But, of it's own merit, the French Lavender Honey is very, very pleasant and fancier flowery scent. And it seems to be a slighter stronger scent. The AC carries it gently throughout the whole house and my peeps approve. To me, it seems like a potpourri smell I experienced in the past, from a closet or a chest. Although I have only used it a week and half, it seems to me it will it last as long as other refills. I put the one of the Air Wick warmers in the the laundry room, and another in the AC/Furnace closet. I use the gentler fragrance Lavender and Vanilla in locations that are physically close to people (dining table, home office, near living room recliner) and I turn those down so they last longer, and are only barely noticeable. I use the giant Mediterranean Lavender warmers in the bath.This product does not come in blister packs. It is boxed, bottles loosely sitting in two cardboard trays. As some reported, a couple of my bottles leaked a little on the cardboard during shipment. I used those two bottles for my warmers. And then I stored the trays under my bathroom sink. So, I don't even consider it to be any problem that they leaked a tiny bit. I bought the ten pack, and the price per bottle is close to the price I pay per bottle in the five packs (of mostly inferior scents IMHO) available in the grocery store. I am so happy to put my stored Air Wick warmers back to work.",

We have 2 of the plug-ins in our small office and every patient that comes in comments on how great the office smells. When the plug-ins are set to High or just under, they last for 2-3 weeks and the smell is just as strong when they stop working as the first day. They do not gradually lose scent and are not overpowering either. I hope this is a scent that is not discontinued in the future.",
