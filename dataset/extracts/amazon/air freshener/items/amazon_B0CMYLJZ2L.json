When he would use them he was always peeing the edges so some ended up on the carpet. I have a heavy duty carpet shampoo machine but it just wasn't cutting it. I finally switched to a commercial grade cleaner and turned his old crate into a potty for him since it has a plastic bottom and hung 2 of these charcoal bags in the area of his old pee mat spot and one on top of his new potty. Everything together has worked because there's no more smell. Hallelujah lol",

I placed the 4 packets out in the sun, as directed to refresh, and will continue to do so...... OLD review ... I read all the positive reviews and thought, okay I'll give it a try. But like many of the reviews with one star, this product does not work. I first placed in the sun for a few hours and hung the 4 pouches inside a small cupboard which has a musty smell even after cleaning it first with bleach and disinfectant. I bought two packs of four. I opened one. The other unopen package I returned.",

Ajoutez a cela le fait que notre b\u00e9b\u00e9 dorme avec nous et que nous ne pouvions donc pas utiliser de Febreze ou \u00e9quivalent, et vous comprendrez que nous \u00e9tions un peu d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9s. Mais ces sachets se sont av\u00e9r\u00e9s tr\u00e8s efficaces, j'ai directement mis les 4 dans la chambre. Le premier jour il pleuvait donc impossible de les activer au soleil et effectivement \u00e7a n'a rien fait Par contre, le jour suivant, apr\u00e8s quelques heures au soleil... Apr\u00e8s 24h l'odeur inf\u00e2me \u00e9tait partie !Efficace et \u00e9colo, je recommande vivement !",
