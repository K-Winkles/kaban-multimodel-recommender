                "reviewText": "First let me state this isn\u2019t like your usual essential oil diffuser. It runs for seconds at a time every 10-17 minutes depending on the setting you have it on & it does so over an 8hr period then goes to \u201csleep\u201d for 16hrs. Essentially it\u2019s a new fancy take on the air freshener auto sprayers. If that\u2019s not what you\u2019re looking for, this isn\u2019t for you.This is perfect for my needs & I\u2019ve admittedly gone a bit overboard with them. They\u2019re so small, minimalistic & portable. It\u2019s perfect for rooms with few plugs since it\u2019s battery operated. Also great for those who want freshness but not constant scent.For the living room I use it as a scent mix up. I like constant scent in here so I\u2019ve got air wick plug-ins but I put a different yet complimentary scent in the diffuser so there\u2019s a burst of extra goodness every so often & it\u2019s also on the side that my plug-in scent just doesn\u2019t fully reach.For my bedroom I have two (my yin & yang). As mentioned before they run for 8hrs on & 16 off. I don\u2019t use plugins in my room but still like freshness so my white one is on with uplifting scents during the day and then the black one comes on at night with the unwinding scents.Lastly, I have one in the guest room which doesn\u2019t get used very often making this diffuser such a nice air freshener option!! I keep it setup, scent & batteries in but turned off. Then when I\u2019m using the room or have guests over all I have to do is turn this little baby on. No worrying about small spaces/plug-ins out of juice or scaring your unsuspecting guests with an auto sprayer.I must say though the initial scents are pretty terrible. The lavender/almond blossom is passable. I\u2019m running out that cartridge for my bedroom night one set on the lowest setting but it does smell fake. The mandarin/tangerine one is absolutely dreadful. Someone likened it to an airport bathroom well I travel a lot & let me tell you they don\u2019t smell this chemically. I mean it smells like tangerines but it is way too strong & I don\u2019t even have the best nose. One of my dogs really doesn\u2019t like it either. I don\u2019t like to waste things so I\u2019ve got it on the lowest setting & in a far corner\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 ok-ish far away but I\u2019ll definitely be changing it out this week for my dogs sake.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not sure if I received a newer version (the taller one), or if it's an older one. But I actually like the taller one better. No, these don't work as good as a proper essential oil diffuser does but they are useful. For campers, RV's, in vehicle cup holders, washrooms and personal use such as directly near you during usage, these are pretty great! For larger rooms and bedrooms, stick with a regular diffuser. If you have a nightstand next to your bed at or near pillow level, these will work for personal use. Great for travel and using in hotel/motel rooms. I'm still waiting to see how long a bottle lasts as well as the batteries in my other ones for giving an update. All of the different scents are quite nice! I get headaches from cheap essential oils I've purchased in the past for my regular diffusers and so was worried about these. Thus far no headaches. I love the auto shut off and on function. I'll totally forget I've one going but when it turns on the next day, suddenly I start smelling the lovely scent. I've since purchased as few as gifts for family and friends. All of whom also really like them. Definitely wouldn't use if you have birds. As one has to be mindful of which essential oils one uses around dogs and cats, same goes for these. I think one of my dogs might be allergic to the Peony one. Just something to keep in mind. These do go on sale, so grab some when they do. For now, highly recommend.Hope this helps!",

I thought I would buy another cause I did like it the first time around and I liked the \"NEW\" design..... however I did not get the \"new\" design that is featured in the pics... I got the original one and I'm not good with paying and ordering one thing and getting something else! Even if it is just a different version of the same thing. NOT COOL Amazon and Amazon Seller!Now I have read some of the reviews and noticed that people are saying that it runs for 8 hours and then turns off for 16 then will cycle back on for another 8 and that it will start that as of the time you put the batteries in and turn it on - that will be your start time (so like I started mine at 2pm so it would run for 8 hours, turn off for 16 and then start up again at 2pm) so people are saying to keep that in mind when you first turn it on..... this is true, however if you find that you don't like the time that it's starting each day, turn it off, take the batteries out and start it over at another time. It doesn't have a memory so doing that will reset the start time for you.. Hope that helps \ud83d\ude01\ud83c\udf7b",
