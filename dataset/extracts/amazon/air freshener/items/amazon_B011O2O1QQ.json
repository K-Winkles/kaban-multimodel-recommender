I put it in the back seat of my car to act as a car freshener that's not a foot away from my face & even back there it's strong enough to add it's scent to the entire car. If I don't want to use it, I just spin it closed and it's off, which I find to be the best part of this product. That feature along extends the life of the product & also not disturb anyone else in my car who doesn't like it. That's something a car freshener can't usually give you! Also, note that this can be strong enough to freshen up an entire room. Put it under or on one of your tables and you'll know that it's working. The only drawback for you is going to be whether or not you love the smell, but it's still not too overwhelming if you're not crazy about the scent.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, if you want to use this inside a trash can to control odor, if there is not a flat surface to attach this to, good luck. The adhesive probably works if it is stuck to a wall or something, but if the surface is plastic or not completely flat, you will have to use strong tape to secure the base and then reinsert the top part.Second, it worked great for about (3) days. Now it has no scent at all. So basically you need to replace it every three to four days if you want continuous scent.",
