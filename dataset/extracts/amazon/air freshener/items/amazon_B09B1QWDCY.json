Sensitive to scents and don\u2019t want to add another one to it? This is the stuff you\u2019re looking for. Fragrance free (and actually, it doesn\u2019t smell like anything), put this thing out and that smell is gone.I do wish it was environmentally friendlier, because they only last a few weeks and it\u2019s a lot of packaging to have to keep replacing. It would be nice if they had refills or something. It\u2019s also not very cute. But for temporary utilitarian purposes, it does the job and it does it well.",

So awesome to be able to open the door and not instantly scrunch up my nose. Any other freshener - beads, gels - anything with a scent would just compound the problem. This No Scent charcoal odor eliminator has really worked. It's been almost 30 days and the smell has yet to return. Will be buying more for other areas of the house.",

I believe a mouse or other rodent got into my engine and met his or her untimely demise. Unfortunately for me, the mouse decided to leave a lasting impression.I tried many things first. I tried a container of white vinegar and baking soda several times (seemed to help but did not last. Then I used half a bottle of Fabreze over the course of a week. That sort of helped, but I still smelled my friend's decomposition.Then I found this item! I typically don't write reviews for everyday items, but I had to write this. The product is excellent. Within a few hours, the small really got knocked down. And then with about a day, I could no longer smell the dead body that had been haunting me for weeks.I highly recommend this product, particularly if you have a smell you want to get rid of, decomposing body or otherwise.",

                "reviewText": "My mother loves fried stuff but I can't stand the smell especially after she cooks fried fish. I put this odor eliminator in the kitchen and I stuck around. At first I thought it didn't work because the smell was still there. After a couple of minutes, I thought, ok it works just a little because the smell is not as evident. I left the kitchen for a few minutes and returned and realize the smell that used to linger for hours is now gone! I'm definitely going to make this a routine household item!",

                "reviewText": "My young adult son showers religiously & doesn\u2019t smell as a whole, but when I walked into his room it would be like being punched in the face with a perfume of an old man smothered in blue cheese dressing. This was probably caused by his dirty clothes filled with young man hormonal sweat being piled with his damp towels. Placed this little baby next to his pile & almost all of the stench has disappeared. I\u2019m very happy with the purchase even if it wasn\u2019t perfect.",
