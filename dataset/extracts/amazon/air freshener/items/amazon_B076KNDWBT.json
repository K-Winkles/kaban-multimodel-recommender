This has worked wonderfully and is not overwhelming. Hoping to air out his room come spring, but until then this has been a life saver.",

Now the room smells amazing all the time! The scent is almost like a subtle lavender baby powder. It did exactly what it had to so I def recommend if you\u2019re having trouble with odors!",
