                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Definitely has a strong scent on first use",
                "reviewText": "This does have a strong scent - one other reviewer described it as \"like a face full of baby powder\". I don't use baby powder but to me it smells like the scent of the Febreze floor cleaner scent my wife uses. I'm hoping it smells the same way to her because otherwise when she gets home I'm in trouble since now the entire house smells of it and in general she has a low tolerance for scents especially anything floral. For whatever reason the Febreze stuff doesn't seem to bother her so I'm hoping I'm okay. Fingers crossed!That said it does seem extremely effective - we had a persistent \"attic dust\" smell every time we came home and I just had our ducts cleaned which reduced it maybe 90%. I squirted a small amount of this inside the main return duct and on the filter and the whole house smells of the scent. There's definitely no chance I could smell the residual \"attic\" smell. Applying scent to the filter is so effective I think even if I used it every single day I'd have more than a year supply but I somehow doubt that will be necessary. My $20 may have just bought me years of fresh duct smell.My bottle was shipped unsealed - there was tape around the neck of the bottle though - so you will be able to discern the scent without even using it. I suggest you let the most scent sensitive member of your household sniff it before applying and return unused if they find it unacceptable. I see other \"no scent\" odor eliminators but none say they are good for ducts. However I would imagine there's not really anything special about a duct freshener vs. any other. If you mist (as fine as possible) this or any product into the return duct while the A/C is running it's going to be distributed through the system, rinse and repeat. If you have any standalone air purifiers I think the same applies.If my wife does not freak out over the scent when she gets home I will spray it into my other return and report back in a week or so on how the scent and odor situation is. After all the idea is this neutralizes not masks odor. If there is no report back from me please call the authorities because I'm probably still locked up in the basement as punishment for stinking up the house :-)",

I've been very self conscious having people over because I Feel like the whole house smells like the basement when the AC or heat runs. But I got this spray, sprayed it into the vents in each of the rooms, and now the smell is completely gone. I am honestly extremely shocked. Even rooms where the odor was particularly bad are completely stank-free.One note I have is that when you first spray it, there is a very strong air freshener smell. I was worried it would hang around. It wasn't a bad smell, but I didn't want my house to smell like a car air freshener. Thankfully after a day or two, that smell has dissipated, but the odors have not returned.I HIGHLY recommend this.",

                "reviewText": "I have issues with a lot of scents and was hoping this would eliminate odors without adding some sort of annoying scent that would bug my sensitive self. I've got chemical sensitivity so I'm really sensitive and this does not smell horrible but smells sort of like baby powder and it gives me the feeling in my mouth like someone just squeezed a bottle of baby powder.It's possible that it's just me and everyone else thinks this smells great. Maybe it will dissipate in a few days and leave the house smelling just cleaner but so far I won't be spraying this in my vents again. We have two systems and I just sprayed it into the intake for the downstairs first because I did not want to get it in the one where I sleep until I knew how I would like it. I think I will pass on doing it in the upstairs based on my experience with the downstairs.Also an aerosol would make better sense rather than a spray bottle if you want this to trully travel through your air vents.I still gave it 3 stars because I realize a big part of my reaction could be my chemical sensitivities. It's too bad they do not make a sample size spray to send out so people could try first before buying a huge bottleThanks for reading my reviewBecky Brooks",
