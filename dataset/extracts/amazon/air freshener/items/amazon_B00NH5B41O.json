BUT it is unnecessary smells I don't like. I found the perfect option \u2013 solid absorbent from the Glade, for me at miracle of nature.Open the bottle (or whatever it's called) and everything! smell like starinnyh absorbed in the charcoal filter. He is absorbed in some kind of gel, the composition of the pictures, the gel exudes a gentle scent, which fills all space, and is present just like on the side. Here we must pay tribute to the manufacturer of the glade, always smells nice and no sharp stench frosty tree or sour Apple.Lacking such vitiates more than 2 months, as the odor absorbing substance dries, the cap you just have more to reveal, until it's all dry, so ajar as the photo is enough for me to soak up the smell. I am very happy, even it is strange that such simple everyday things that bring so much pleasure. http://www.amazon.com/Glade-Solid-Freshener-Cashmere-Woods/dp/B00NH5B41O?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=od_aui_detailpages00",

                "reviewText": "My mom used to get these types of air fresheners a lot when I was young and they always seemed to have the same generic flowery cheap bathroom spray smell to them but this scent is absolutely divine.I'd describe it as a naturally fresh and clean yet warm smell. Simple yet bold but not overpowering nor fragrancy and flowery. I'm not sure if this is what cashmere smells like, but I love it. It has a particular note that I've smelled in a nice cologne or body wash or similar before, can't remember at all but it rings a bell. Wish I had ordered more when they were on sale for $1.Will fill a large room and lasts much longer than cheaper versions. Love the smell so much, not perfumey at all, I think most guys would really like this one compared to most other scents.",
