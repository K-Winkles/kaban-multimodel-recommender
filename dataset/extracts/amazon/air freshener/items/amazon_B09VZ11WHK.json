I had a car filled with smoke smell, and after several applications of baking soda, vacuuming it up, cleaning all surfaces (inside of windows, under seats, all floor mats) the smoke smell still lingered. I tried a spraycan odor eliminator from Amazon, and the stink from it was AWFUL. I want no smell, not an awful smell that would mask the smoke smell. Then I tried this odor eliminator, and finally, something works! It really works! It is better than 10 boxes of baking soda, AND it will last 10 years! Amazing product, and very happy I found it. My car no longer smells (no smoke smell, and no nasty spraycan smell either).",

In three days, all odors were gone. My husband absconded with the second one for his closest and told me he was thrilled how it worked within a week to clear the smell. So I ended up purchasing a 3rd one for the fridge. The stainless steel look is unobtrusive and looks a whole lot better than an open box of baking soda. Worth every penny!",

                "reviewText": "I really thought I was taking part in a giant hustle, but I was desperate. There was a mystery smell in my refrigerator that would not go away no matter how many times I scrubbed it and it was making me crazy. I finally ordered this and in less than 24 hours the smell is completely gone. I don't know how or why it works and I don't even care, but I can assure you somehow it does. Some people say it doesn't last more than a year, but I am more than happy if I get a year out of this and feel that it's more than worth the money. If I don't get more than a month or two out of it, I still feel it is worth the money. No amount of white vinegar, baking soda, or cleaning helped. This did!",
