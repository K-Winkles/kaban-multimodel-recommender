                "reviewText": "Fantastic product, keeps the litter box area from smelling too bad, lasts about two weeks and is only $3ish each.When it doesn't arrive damaged. The lid is very easy to pop off and the contents will spill out into the packaging, I put this on subscribe and save because I liked the product, but after having three out of five deliveries arrive ruined, It's not worth the return process when the next one is just going to arrive destroyed as well. Try to find it locally, because it is a good product but do not buy from amazon, it is too easily damaged in shipping",
