I\u2019ve used a lot of different air fresheners in my convertible but notice 2 issues; the smell doesn\u2019t stick around and it goes away (and stays away) after riding in my car with the top down 1 time. I\u2019ve been using my first can for about a week, had had the convertible top down several times but the cherry smell is super potent anytime I get into the car.....which is awesome! The cost for 4 cans is so much cheaper than buying 4 cans from the store too!",
