I expected the scent to last that long, even though product details state \u201cup to 45 days\u201d. I put it in a closet that\u2019s opened briefly about 3 times per week. The fragrance was slightly noticeable for about 2 weeks. As of right now, I no longer smell anything. I really wanted that nice Lemon Verbena breeze when I opened the closet door : ) It does still seem to be doing the job of keeping my closet fresh, so that's something. Here\u2019s a tip, for what it\u2019s worth: turn the container upside down to disperse as much of the scent through the openings as possible.",
