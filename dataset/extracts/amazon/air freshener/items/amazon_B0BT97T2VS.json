                "reviewText": "I was first drawn to the name, Bergmont, because I do love the scent, using the reeds I was skeptical. When it arrived I put the reeds that came with it in the jar and was disappointed. I ordered reeds that absorb better and used them when they came. I loved the scent, it filled my bathroom and large walk-in closetto ascent that truly was heavenly. Later I added a couple more reeds to intensify the smell and was not disappointed. Problem the more reeds the faster the liquid is soaked up. This was sold at a great and affordable price and I am buying an another. The bottle was very heavy and high end, I intend using the bottle again. My husband went into the closet a couple days later said it smelled like an expensive store.",

While the fragrance is very different from what I used to use, this presents an opportunity to try something new. It smells nice and the bottle is very attractive so, I have to give it a 5 star rating.",
