It has a sweet citrus like scent, reminded me of a grapefruit. When I ordered this, I had no idea what a yuzu was. I looked it up after I plugged it in, only to discover a yuzu is a korean citrus fruit. That's where the citrus hint was coming from!",

It's a very clean nice scent but not too overpowering like woody or floral fragrances can be. 2 plug-ins were enough to spread the scent throughout my home. Unfortunately, although these plug-ins start out very strong, their lasting power decrease significantly after 2 weeks.",
