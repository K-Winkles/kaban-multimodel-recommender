                "reviewText": "I bought this room spray in an attempt to eliminate a roommates odor, although this does work for a brief period of time ~15 minutes. It in no way completely deodorizes a room, now this may be because he legitimately has the smell baked into his furnishing and clothes to the point where nothing can remove the smell, but the spray does help somewhat. The smell is pretty nice, nothing crazy and not overwhelming if sprayed in moderation. Overall, it is a pretty good spray to mask light odors and serves as a nice fresh scent when you can't get one anywhere else.",

I normally am not the type to order something fragrant without testing it out in store first but I decided to order the \u201cMountain\u201d scent based on the fragrance notes described online. Scent is nice, however, a bit sweeter than I expected. I prefer more woodsy scents but if you enjoy a more floral and sweet fragrance, I think you will like the Mountain scent. IT\u2019S STRONG, so you could expect it to eliminate odors. Wouldn\u2019t recommend overspraying in case you are sensitive to smells (too much gave me a bit of a headache tbh). Despite this, I am happy with the product and would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This is the first time I have found this scent that I have been searching for many years. When I was a child we had two Lilac bushes at our home in Chicago. This scent captures that glorious scent of those flowering bushes in spring. Aside from making my apartment smell like my childhood memories, it also works when my 14 year old cat uses his litter pan to poop. While I clean it immediately and take it outside, I can count on my Lilac Febreze to freshen the air. Yes, I bought the 3 pack, because I Love it.",
