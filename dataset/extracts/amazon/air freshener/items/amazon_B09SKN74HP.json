                "reviewText": "My husband nd I have been using these fabreze plugins for probably over 10 years now and this is by far the best scent. The gain leaves our house always smelling fresh and clean and people can even smell it in the hallway (live in apartment) and always tell us our place smells so clean. Granted, we are clean freaks but they really do work, they last the entire month and we have them on auto ship because we cannot live without them. Buy it! You won\u2019t regret it and your home will always smell amazing.",

I have tried everything, including a $500 Reme-Halo device in the ac duct, KILLZ primer and paint, Tea Tree, Chlorine Dioxide, MERV 13 Carbon Filters, Air Oasis, Ozone Machine, and Plug-ins, but the stale odor persists. I just tried this Febreeze plugin last night because I have guests arriving on Friday. I went into the house this morning and was pleasantly surprised how nice it smelled! It was not overpowering or too perfumy, but just right. Could it have neutralizes the stale odor somehow? I am researching what exactly Frebeeze does because it does not seem like a regular air freshener \"cover-up\" by overpowering with something else. I know this is not a permanent solution to the issue, but it will get me through the holidays until I have time to figure out where the musty, \"old house\" smell is coming from.",

I purchased the 3 pack on 11/5/2023 and I just plugged in my last plugin on 2/7/2024. The claim that it is 1st day fresh for 150 days is absolutely false. The plugin gives you a blue flashing light when it\u2019s time to put in a refill. I keep mine on \u201cminimum\u201d so it wouldn\u2019t run out super quickly. I\u2019ve had to refill 3 times since 11/2023 which is roughly 90 days. So 1 refill will last about a month if you use it on the minimum setting. Where they got the 150 days from, I have no idea because it\u2019s objectively false. I would have no qualms with this product had it not been for the false claim.",
