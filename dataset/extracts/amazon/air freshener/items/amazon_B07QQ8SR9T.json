                "reviewText": "For years, I'm talking more than a decade, I used to buy Air Wick and Glade spray for my bathroom. I liked the scents, however, it would take a lot of product to get rid of the bad odors, and because of that, the floor would get slippery. Plus, Air Wick would often make me sneeze because of how heavy it feels in my nose. Then, I did a Google search about the best bathroom room sprays and this product was in the top 3 in all the articles I looked. At first I was skeptic about how good it would really be. So, I bought them and OMG! IT'S TRUE! This is what I had always been looking for. An air freshener that with just 2 to 3 sprays would get rid of the bad odors. It did the job better than I expected. I know in the long run I am saving money because I won't waste product anymore, and I won't have to worry about slippery floors anymore. Plus, the packaging looks fancy and the scent has a more serious tone. Feebreze, thank you so much!!!!",
