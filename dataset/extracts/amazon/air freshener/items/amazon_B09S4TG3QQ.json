The long-lasting, good scent of this product really impressed me. It's great for small areas and does a fantastic job of keeping the air fresh. The fact that it is worth the price makes it even better.I must highlight the long-lasting, good scent of this air freshener. It really permeates the room and lasts for a long time, which is a huge plus. The fresh and pleasant aroma adds a delightful touch to the atmosphere.In addition, the compact size makes it perfect for small spaces like bathrooms or closets. I appreciate that it's not overpowering but still effective in eliminating odors. This makes it a great choice for those looking for a subtle yet effective air freshener.However, I did notice that there is no option to adjust the intensity of the scent, which may be a drawback for some users. Overall, I am very satisfied with the Febreze Small Spaces Air Freshener and would definitely recommend it to others.",

                "reviewText": "I love these and use them in each of my bathrooms/toilets.I particularly like the Gain scent (which I ordered) but was sent \"original scent\" instead. I was quite miffed at first, and would have exchanged it, but \"original\" wasn't bad.The only complaints I have is that it is difficult to tell when three blister scent pack is pierced via the \"button\" in the back; and the pack is only about 45% full (shrink-flation?).The Gain scent is green and the original appears to be non-colored, so you might take aesthetics into consideration when choosing.",
