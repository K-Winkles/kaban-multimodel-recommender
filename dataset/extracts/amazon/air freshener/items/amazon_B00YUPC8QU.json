                "reviewText": "This product works well in our HVAC duct system to keep the musty odors eliminated during cooling season. The first time we used it we had to pop the gel out of the container it came in and put it in a larger container so the gel had more surface area exposed to the air flow in our return air duct. After 3 weeks of initial use the gel was almost all gone along with the musty odor and we dropped the remaining gel back into the original container to continue to maintain the system. The gel scent is not strong enough to be noticeable in our home but it has made the air odor more pleasant. We are purchasing additional product to keep maintaining the odor. We are very pleased with the product.",

Use the spray from the same maker GENEROUSLY FIRST in the intake with the fan running to distribute into ducts, then use these on top of the filter in the intake. follow the directions and empty the gel block in a larger plastic container so all sides are exposed or it will not work right! A bit pricey but nothing else worked, duct cleaning is a bait and switch racket especially here in Florida! Try this!!!",

I moved into this home a few years ago and would periodically get a dog smell when the AC or heat turned on. This has gone away since using this product.My problem is with the quality of what I am receiving. I have this item on subscribe and save and the last couple items I have received have had issues. The tubs are only 2/4 filled or less and/or seem to have a lot of liquid in them. This is supposed to be a gel, not a liquid. I understand that products settle but not gel. So there has been a considerable difference from tub to tub. Some tube are totally filled to the top, others are only two thirds filled and in at least two cases, when I opened the tub I was able to see half of the bottom of the tub on one side and there was a lot of liquid in the tub. Generally I open the tub and turn it upside down on top of my intake vents (all of my vents are on the floor. The first one of these, with this issue, I turned over and had the liquid spill all over my floor. I've been more careful since then and found two additional ones with all this liquid and being half empty. I am considering trying another product,",
