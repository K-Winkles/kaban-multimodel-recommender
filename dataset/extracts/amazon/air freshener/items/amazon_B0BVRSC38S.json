                "reviewText": "The scent that came with it is nice but not very noticeable in the room. I have the older version of the Glade holder. But when I ordered this one, I didn't realize there had been a design change. Tried to open it the same as my other, (pushing the button on the top). That top button is now the spray button on the new version. Then tried squeezing the sides where those little grooves are, then tried squeezing near the top and in the middle. I felt pretty stupid for not being able to open it. Decided to return it but the return process directed me to contact the manufacturer instead of offering a refund. I did call them and they had me squeeze the sides of the unit again to open it. Again, it didn't work. After going back and forth with the lady on the other line trying to help me, it was determined I wasn't squeezing the sides hard enough. I guess my fingers aren't all that strong because it took an awful lot of effort - more than I would have guessed. I did get it open but not without a sore finger. So, I'm stuck with it. When it's time to change the batteries, I'll probably toss it. I do like my old Glade holder that looks the same, but pops right open by pushing a button at the top. If I can find another one of those, I'll probably buy it.",

Probably better suited for an office building or public restroom.",
