                "reviewText": "I HAD TO WAIT A LITTLE WHILE AFTER I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON BEFORE EVALUATING IT TO SEE HOW LONG THE SCENT LASTS. WELL, IT'S BEEN IN MY TRUCK FOR SOMETHING LIKE THREE WEEKS NOW AND IT IS STILL DISPENSING AN UNDIMINISHED PLEASANT AROMA. HOW LONG THE AROMA WILL LAST IS ANYBODY'S GUESS, BUT SO FAR ITS LONGEIVITY HAS BEEN QUITE SATISFACTORY. THE LIQUID SCENT PRODUCT IS CONTAINED IN A BLACK PLASTIC DISPENSER ABOUT ONE AND A HALF INCHES SQUARE (37.5 MM, GIVE OR TAKE). I ATTACHED MINE ONTO A AIRVENT LOUVER, BUT IT CAN BE PLACED ANYWHERE THAT HAS A THIN-ENOUGH SURFACE FOR THE BUILT-ON CLIP TO GRIP. THERE IS A TINY PLASTIC CLEAR WINDOW ON THE FRONT SO THAT ONE CAN SEE HOW MUCH OF THE LIQUID SCENT PRODUCT REMAINS. IT'S 'KINDA LIKE LOOKING AT A MINIATURE \"BLUE LAGOON.\" THERE IS A SLIDING TAB AT THE VERY TOP WHICH ALLOWS THE USER TO ADJUST HOW MUCH SCENT IS RELEASED. I HAVE KEPT MINE AT THE LOWEST SETTING. THAT WORKS FINE FOR ME--MY TRUCK CAB HAS A SMALL INSIDE VOLUME, AND I DON'T THINK I GET BEHIND THE WHEEL AT THE END OF THE DAY WEARING A NOXIOUS ODOR (FOLKS WHO WORK, SAY IN A TANNERY FOR INSTANCE, MIGHT WANT TO DIAL IN A STRONGER AROMA VOLUME). THE PRODUCT IS MADE OF PLASTIC, WHICH IN THIS CASE IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. THERE ARE NO MARKINGS INDICATING THE PIECE IS RECYCLABLE. FINALLY, LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT HOW THE LIQUID SCENT IS FORMULATED. THE PRODUCT INSTRUCTION SHEET INDICATES, IN BOTH ENGLISH AND FRENCH, THAT NO PHTHALATES OR FORMALDEHYDE HAS BEEN USED, BUT DOES NOT INDICATE WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN THE CHEMICAL MIX. THE PRODUCT IS MANUFACTURED IN MEXICO AND THERE IS NO MEDICAL STAMP OF APPROVAL FROM ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY--OR FROM ANYWHERE, FOR THAT MATTER. SO IN THE CASE OF A POSSIBLE NEGATIVE REACTION, I GUESS IT'S \"BUYER BEWARE.\" STILL, I LIKE THE PRODUCT VERY MUCH. I HOPE BUYERS WILL ENJOY HAVING A PLEASENT SCENT IN YOUR VEHICLE AS MUCH AS I HAVE IN MINE.",

                "reviewText": "So normally we buy the platinum ice scent (smells like men\u2019s cologne) from this brand but it\u2019s been so hard to find that we decided to get this scent thinking it would smell decent..... my husband is a construction worker and likes his truck smelling good... so at the moment of buying this we were just trying to find one cause the other had been empty awhile...Well...We were wrong... this scent was horrible!! It in no way smelled like a new car scent. I cannot describe the scent but it made my husband nausea so he took it out and put it in the kitchen (not knowing what else to do with it) that\u2019s when I really got to smell it...The reason I gave it at least 3 stars was cause we do like this brand and we have been using it for years!!! We just do not like this particular scent!! I threw away the 2 air freshener packs that came in this scent and ran to the Wally World to find something in place of platinum ice (whichever found in another brand) so we could get rid of this terrible new car scent that was lingering in my husbands truck!!I really wish I could describe the new car smell air freshener but I can\u2019t..... its not even close to it!!It\u2019s somewhat like a moldy musty smell in my opinion!!We hope Frebreze didn\u2019t discontinue the platinum ice scent for this cause that would be a mistake.... lots of men we know use that scent cause it\u2019s manly!!!Anyhow..... I do not suggest you buy this scent... I would say if you\u2019re really curious what it smells like go to your local store and scratch and sniff before you buy it.... like I said we all like different scents and prefer different scent... this definitely was not for us!! It\u2019s neither feminine or manly... it\u2019s just very odd!On a better note.... these frebreze car air fresheners are generally really good, they last long, they clip to your ac vent which helps circulate the scent every time you turn it on. No need to constantly spray anything and no air freshener tin can to take up the cup holder space!! We like these ac clips just not this scent!! It\u2019s a good value and reliable... when you get the right scent you like!!I hope this helpful!!",
