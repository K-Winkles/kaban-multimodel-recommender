I do not recommend or appreciate your cost cutting , if that was what it is?The plastic shipping bag was actually torn partially open . Amazingly, my tri color inkjet cartridges were still in the bag . For that I am pleased but not happy with the shipping method.",

Not only is it a lovely smell, nice product, but the price then was close to price I get in the stores.Now of course, I wouldn't purchase the item here again - not at double the price I paid last month, and much more than getting it in a store - but the item smells nice and lasts what you'd expect.",

Makes no sense as other scents of same brand I get delivered to me.I really like this scent the best. It may appear overpowering when first opened, but quickly becomes a soft release of scent over time. If you have small kids or pets, or just want it to look nicer - take the top off, pop the small \u201cplug\u201d from the inside, just push it out. Then replace the top back on the gel, now with a hole at the very top for scent to slow release. Lasts a couple months.",
