This has done a wonderful job in the hallway masking that smell since putting up. I put it on the strongest setting for the first 24 hours, which was really strong so I had to turn it down to medium to balance. I will say, it does smell very aerosol and I wish it smelled a bit more wet (like febreze or glade spray), but it\u2019s doing its job!",

The sound gets some used to as I was startled when it first went off as I was home alone at night and all of a sudden it dispensed, and I thought someone was in the other room b/c it was so loud. I was relieved to realize it was just the freshener doing the automatic spray. It doesn't work as well in a larger room as it only freshened the living room in the spot it was at, but I will try it in the bathroom as the other reviews mentioned it was better.",

                "reviewText": "Can't say I have been overly impressed with these. I have had them for about a year now and they don't work the way I had planned. First problem is after it sprays the scent is very strong, almost to the point that my lungs don't want to breath for a few seconds. Second thing is that after it sprays the scent dissipates leaving no good smell after about 30 seconds to a minute later, after a year I would think my home would take on the scent and smell good but no, smells the same as before. The third thing is unless I set the timer to spray on the shortest setting there is very little scent in the home which runs the spray can out really fast. The fourth thing is I have had 2 cans go bad and make a mess. I put a new can in the unit and it sprays like it's suppose to for a few but then later I find that it had started spraying inside of the unit instead of out into the room, the inside of the unit was just soaked with oil with a pool of oil under it and running out on the table/bookcase making a mess and wasting the can/money. I found that the problem was instead of spraying out the nozzle tip it started spraying out where the nozzle pushes into the top of the can. The fifth thing I have a problem with is in finding that these are full of oil I now know oil is being sprayed and settling all over everything in my home and us breathing it. I will be looking for a different product.",
