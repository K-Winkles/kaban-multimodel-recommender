                "reviewText": "Bought this for my office which is a smaller space but throughout the day and evening, the space doubles as a hang out and warm spot for the smokers in the house to smoke since we don't smoke inside the house and the office is in a finished side of our barn out back. I suppose that makes my office space my Witch Barn (feel free to substitute whatever letter you prefer on the first word lol). The small space fills with smoke rather quickly and tends to continuously have a bar room haze until the door opens or closes. At night, when you open the door you can watch the smoke pour out as if Willie Nelson has been in the room at all long chillin.I was skeptical at first with this because when I initially set it up in my office, the lights were off and it was dark. I thought something was wrong because the unit would come and for a moment and then turn off but the lights were still on. The following day, my husband and I were sitting in my office together working on a project, and he lit a cigarette. Within a few minutes, this little thing lit up red and turned on. That evening, when us and our guests were hanging out, it would pop on whenever anyone was smoking.5 stars because Auto mode is a life saver and the best part? No more bar room haze, no more dusty and musty smells, and it clears the smoke in less then 30 minutes. It's quiet even when its not in night mode with sound equivalent to the med-high setting on a stand up oscillating fan. Hands down best one of the best investments we've made so far and even better, my allergies aren't kicking when I'm in my office anymore. Will defiantly be buying a couple more, the bigger one for our living room and dining room, and a couple small ones for the bedrooms!!",

                "reviewText": "The Instant Air Purifier works like a charm. I had no idea how dirty the air got in the room next to the unfinished storage area where we keep litter boxes for our cats. The litter is supposed to be dust free, but it is not. If you have anyone with respiratory sensitivities in your home, this air purifier is a great purchase. Very economical, especially when you compare to other HEPA air purifiers that are much more pricy such as Dyson's line up.",

                "reviewText": "Apologies for the blurry pic.Any people who are like \"Does this thing even work!?\" obviously don't have a smoker in the house. Yes. It's practically silent most of the time until I decide to have myself a smoke. Then the thing turns red, kicks into high gear and does an impression of a jet engine. And I feel like it's trying to shame me. Yes, machine, I am aware smoking is bad for me. Yelling at me louder for it isn't going to make me quit instantly!!Other than that... there's really no hassle. Plug it in and turn it on. Everything's automatic, and you can adjust everything manually if you prefer.Oh yeah, don't forget to open the bottom (just twists out/in) and take the plastic off of the filter before you start it. WHOOPS.The replacement filters are pretty spendy... 50-60, I believe. (Feel free to double-check). It says they should last about a year... but considering it disapproves of my lifestyle, we'll see about that...UPDATE, about a week or so later: So after a day or two... even the first day. When I came home from work, it wasn't on. I wasn't home smoking up the place, so I figured it went into low-power mode. It said it would do that. As time went on, I noticed it wasn't kicking on. And I'd been smoking, this thing should be screaming at me by now. What's wrong? Plugged in, yes. I can feel air coming out very lightly. I could turn it on and off again, then it would kick on and start going red for a few minutes... then turn off before it even got to yellow. What gives?I had it in auto mode, cuz that seemed like the thing to do. And after some research, I discovered it goes into night mode when it senses low/no lights. Smart tech, you see! But my friends, it wasn't smart enough to realize it now lives with a guy who sits in a dark room all day and smokes like a chimney! Didn't see that one coming, did you smarty pants air purifier!?The solution I could figure was to just set the fan manually. Medium seems like a reasonable choice so it can actually sort of keep up with me, and also not drown out my PC. Turn on the ion... set the light dimmer so you can see the buttons in the dark. And boom.Knocks a point or two off for quality of life and perhaps value, since now it's just doing what my old one did that cost about a quarter as much. But with a thicker filter? Can't really tell you how well it's actually cleaning the air, since apparently it's been in power saving mode a majority of the time I've had it.",

The first one I put in the kitchen, and whenever something is getting extra toasted it turns on and deals quickly with whatever smoke particles it detects. I bought a second to set up during a dusty home renovation project, and although of course it couldn't catch all the dust floating around, it definitely kicked into overdrive and kept the air more breathable when dusty things were happening. A sizeable fixture, but they're earning their real estate.",
