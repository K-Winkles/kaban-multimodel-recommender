                "reviewText": "The Rubbermaid Odor Control Dispenser are great for places that need odor control the most. In my case it is used in the bathroom. In the past I have been iffy about bathroom sprays in general. While some smell great alone, they do not mingle well with other odors nor do they eliminate them. This scent in particular smells somewhat like a creamsicle, which I like--so do not expect an orange peel scent when you purchase this. Not only is the scent a very pleasant one, it keeps the bathroom smelling nice up until the very next spray.",

You don't need the holder; just use as is very thought it says refill. Well worth the money.
