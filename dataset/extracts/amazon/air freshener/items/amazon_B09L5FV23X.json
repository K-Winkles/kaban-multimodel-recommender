                "reviewText": "I felt that the results with this have been inconsistent since sometimes I spray the house with the windows open and it smells normal after a few hours but in other occasions it feels like it\u2019s done absolutely nothing.One time I thought it would be a good idea to cover the gaps in my door and smoke in my room with people in the house. turned out my room absolutely stank for at least 8 hours when I had a window open the entire time and a dehumidifier and a fan on and all the while spraying this stuff like crazy (using about 1/4 of the spray).I believe the spray itself is likely good for removing odours but it is just way too little to actually be effective when in a situation where it would be necessary to use one of these.I honestly think you\u2019d be better off just buying some neutradol or a generic air freshener which works as an odour eliminator since these are significantly cheaper and have much much much more quantity so they will be more effective.the problem with the marketing is it acts as though this odour eliminator is specifically designed to just completely counter the smell of bud, that\u2019s just simply not true and if you look at this as just a lavender air freshener then it really is a ripoff.I\u2019ve given this 2 stars and not less or more because it is an odour eliminator and it has potentially helped me on occasions but It would be much more efficient to just buy a regular odour eliminator / air freshener and let it rip for a short time.the smell also isn\u2019t anything too nice and doesn\u2019t last long so It\u2019s not even good in that regard.just keep your money and buy something that eliminates all odours. the brand cannabolish is a gimmicky idea to try to generate more sales by targeting their products to stoners. don\u2019t fall for this stuff even if it\u2019s not a total scam.",
