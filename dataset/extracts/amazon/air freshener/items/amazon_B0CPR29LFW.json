It's the most clean crisp smell of watermelon but with a twist of cucumber. It's absolutely mouth watering!I love the glade refills because they cover a good bit of area and last longer. This 5 pack will fill most rooms of every home. I plan to order more once these start running low!They're easy to snap in, you literally just pop them out of the package, un screw the protective top and snap it in to your glade plug.I highly recommend these refills! They're longer lasting, great quality refills that will make any home smell great. I get so many compliments when people first walk in!",

I ended up having to use these at my office where I have a Glade one. I would make sure that your plug in is the correct brand before getting these. The post part that goes into the warmer is much longer on these than some others require. The scent itself is light and pleasing and lasts a long time. Since my office is near the restrooms, it's important for me to have something in there that smells really good and these definitely get the job done.",

I always keep our plug ins on the lowest setting, but after being exposed to it for awhile, I started to find this scent to be irritating. I'll probably give the rest of these away and go back to one of our old, tried-but-true scents.",

In my case I already owned a couple Glade max control plug in warmer that I could use the refills with. The refills fit the warmer perfectly and I had no issues with leakage. This is my first time trying out the Super Bloom scent and I love how light the floral scent is. I definitely recommend trying this scent if you\u2019re looking for a more light fresh floral scent.",

I usually prefer Air Wick for its lower price and newer warmers, but this one's a winner.",
