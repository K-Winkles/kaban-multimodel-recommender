        "description": "Discreet and secure, the Eco Clip air freshener works great in ladies restrooms to eliminate odors at the source. People care, and they appreciate it. The clip works on the outside of bowls (where the seat goes down and stays down) in the ladies room, or the tops of restroom partitions or the side of tanks in the mens room to combat odors and create freshness. (Also check out Fresh Wave 3D urinal deodorizers for men.) The Eco Clip locks into place to eliminate odors and create freshness. Containing 50x more air freshening than standard rimsticks, the Eco Clip gradually releases air freshener over 30 days. The clip is secured in place and shrinks to fit as fragrance evaporates, so it does not move after placement. Eco Clip is 100 percent recyclable, does not dissolve when wet, or pollute the water. Complies with VOC requirements in all 50 states, North America and Europe. Sample Pack contains ONE clip for each of the following eight fragrances: Cotton Blossom, Cucumber Melon, Ocean Mist, Spiced Apple, Mango, Honeysuckle, Herbal Mint, and Guava Pineapple. (Note: Citrus, Fabulous (Lavender), or Kiwi Grapefruit may occasionally be substituted for one of the other fragrances in the sample pack.)",

So you can see how we might really need a solution to bathroom smells. I bought the sample pack so I could try them all out. So far so good. All of the scents have been pleasant but I have only used a few. Mango was very strong smelling and I could smell it all over the house for the first few days. I was glad it faded because I didn't want to smell that as soon as I walked in the door though this didn't keep it from working like it should in the bathroom. Cucumber Melon was much more mellow smelling and even though I couldn't smell it all over the house, it did last just as long as mango. They last quite a while. I change mine out every 4 weeks. Another reviewer mentioned that they use theirs for the trash can. I like that idea and I'm going to try it. I will update my review if I find one of the scent to be offensive.",

                "reviewText": "In the description, the seller states that this Sample Pack contains ONE clip for each of the following eight fragrances:Cotton BlossomCucumber MelonOcean MistSpiced AppleMangoHoneysuckleHerbal MintGuava PineappleThey then note that Citrus, Fabulous (Lavender), or Kiwi Grapefruit \"may occasionally be substituted for one of the other fragrances in the sample pack\".Well, I received TWO Fabulous (Lavender), and EITHER Cotton Blossom OR Ocean Mist (no label), and EITHER Cucumber Melon OR Herbal Mint (I'm thinking it's Herbal Mint, because it's STRONG\u2014and I really wanted a sample of the Cucumber Melon to see if it was sufficiently WEAK).I ALSO received Citrus, so that means I've either got Guava Pineapple or Mango. \"Guava Pineapple\" isn't a listed scent for Fresh Products, and I can't find this scent listed on Amazon. The item I received that is Orange (which would be Mango) doesn't smell like Mango to me, so\u2026 again, useless for evaluating this scent.So, the only scents I have that I KNOW what they are are Honeysuckle (which I know I don't like) and TWO Lavender (which I know I hate), and Spiced Apple, which I did want to sample. And either Cotton Blossom OR Ocean Mist, neither of which I'm particularly interested in. And a scent that is NOT Mango and a scent that is NOT Cucumber Melon.What a pointless waste. If you're buying this Sample Pack to sample specific scents\u2026 DON'T BOTHER.",
