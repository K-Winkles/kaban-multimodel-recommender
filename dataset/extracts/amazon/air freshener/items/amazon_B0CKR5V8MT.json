                "reviewText": "This set of air freshener dispensers arrived quickly and well packaged. The set includes 2 dispensers that take 2 AA batteries (not included) each. The dispensers are simplistic and if I\u2019m being honest kind of look and feel cheap. That aside, they function as they should. You simply insert any of the compatible air freshener cans and then choose the frequency you would like it to spray. The time options are every 5, 15, or 30 minutes. I personally would prefer an added 45 and 60 minute option to reduce waste of the product and because I am using these in my home and every 30 minutes is still a bit excessive. I definitely feel these would be ideal for a business or if you are trying to prevent pet odors near a litter box or something. These can work throughout your home, but I turn them off at night so we aren\u2019t blowing through the air freshener cans at light speed. I do like that these can be mounted on a wall or set on a counter. The price point for the set is comparable to others on the market. Overall, this is a decent set of air freshener dispensers that work as they should but they just feel a bit cheap and need an additional timer setting to help preserve product. Would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The included toggle between 5, 15, and 30 minute spray intervals is a nice feature, as well helps save a lot of spray from being wasted. I'm glad they also included some adhesive mounts that are transparent and stick somewhat okay to walls. You have to find a very flat surface wall that doesn't have any oddities. As for batteries, it takes 2 AA and has lasted a good 2 weeks so far, so I'm sure it will last a long time more. It does feel a little cheap on the plastic, but it is light, which does help for sticking to walls",

These are a bit on the pricey side for not coming with any scents, considering what a whole kit can run. It works just fine, but Unless you need just this device, mine died, I'd recommend something else.",

                "reviewText": "I have an older AirWick automatic sprayer that\u2019s held up well, which is what I\u2019m comparing this to. Neither one is as fancy looking as the newest models, this one looks closer to the older one that I already owned (except this one has lights, a plus). Depending on the room you\u2019re putting it in and your decor, that may be fine. Unlike my old one, this has a manual spray button which is a very nice addition for when you want a little extra. Like my older one, it takes two batteries. The air freshener fit in this model and worked just fine. I also had some Glade refills that worked. The plastic on the older one is a little thicker and feels stronger, the most noticeable difference is with the front piece that opens. I was worried it would crack when opening, but it was fine. I\u2019m not sure how long it will hold up compared to my old one, but in the meantime it\u2019s working just fine.",

Will have the whole house smelling good.",

I wanted a couple more dispensers and saw these. They arrived quickly and were packaged well. You get 2 in a pack. They use 2 AA batteries (not included) and can be wall mounted or set on a counter. Quality wise, they are a bit on the cheaper side. They aren't as heavy and feel a little more flimsy than the actual dispensers that come with the fragrances. Regardless, they function well and I haven't had any issues with them. They are compatible with all different brands so no need to check what cans you are buying.",
