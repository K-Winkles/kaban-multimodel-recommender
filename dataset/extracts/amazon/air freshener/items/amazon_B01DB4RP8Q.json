I traded up my diaper genie for a stylish Ubbi diaper pail, but had serious regrets when the stench reached new levels (and not in a good way)! I loved that the Ubbi allows any trash bag to be used, but let me say regular trash bags, even with Febreeze scent, didn't help with the odor at all! Every time I opened the pail to add a new diaper and especially when it was full and time to empty, the odor that seeped out was so strong it filled the room and seemed to hang there for 15-20 mins. My husband found it unbearable and was begging to go back to the old genie that contained the smell a lot better, but after spending so much on the Ubbi, I decided to try these little pouches to see if they can save the day...and let me say, YES, they work wonders! I would highly, highly recommend giving these a try. I have two in my pail now, one on the bottom, the other taped to the lid, and they started working immediately. No more complaints, blaming the dog for the fart smell in the nursery or false sniffs thinking the baby pooped again. I can't wait to try them out on a stinky pair of sneakers next.",

                "reviewText": "These work wonders! If your having the open the diaper pail and then huge stinky scent comes pour out this fixes that! We have been using for a week or so and have noticed huge difference even if at 15 days when we try and re-energize them if that doesn\u2019t work we would just use a brand new one and replace every 15 days and pay for new ones when needed as it\u2019s totally worth it so solve a problem that we lived with with our first LO the whole time and now on #2 have finally fix this stinky problem at almost 2 years old but I guess better now than never!Highly recommend! Even dad said these are the best thing you have purchased that I didn\u2019t know existed! Give it 6 stars!",

I have read other people with the same litter box have had great luck with using charcoal to help odor control so I thought I\u2019d try these. I threw about 6 of these in the drawer and have not noticed a difference. The search continues for me.",

                "reviewText": "I disliked that it said it would last long but only lasted about a half of a month or a month longer than the usual brand I used no matter how many times they were put outside in the sun. No scent really but by the month and a half they'd slowly stop working even after I'd sun the pads for the time. I have not purchased since the first time. Added work with sunning then to TRY to get them to work longer flopped for me. I've been back to diaper genie filter brand and they last a month as advertised.",
