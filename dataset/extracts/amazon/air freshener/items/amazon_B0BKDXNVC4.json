However, the 6 pack arrived in tall aerosol spray cans, not pump bottles as pictured. Also I want to point out that the move to \u201cnatural\u201d propellants in these air fresheners means you will have misty, damp floors, like you had sprayed (for example only) Febreze fabric spray as a room air freshener. The can sez \u201cwipe floors dry\u201d. Didn\u2019t used to have to do that, but those who purchase the new formulas risk being left with a slippery floor after the product has dried. So the consumer should now be prepared to wash their floors now after using these products? Another example where \u201cnatural\u201d formats turn out inferior in comparison to their original versions!",
