                "reviewText": "I recently purchased Mrs. Meyer's Room and Air Freshener Spray, and it has become a fast favorite in our household. The product\u2019s eco-friendly design and simple ingredient list immediately stood out to me, aligning perfectly with our preference for natural and sustainable options.The non-aerosol design is a big win, as it aligns with my commitment to environmentally friendly choices. It's not often you find a company that values both the quality of their products and the impact they have on the environment, and Mrs. Meyer's seems to have achieved that balance.The 8 fl. oz. Honeysuckle spray has an absolutely delightful scent. Infused with essential oils, it brings a refreshing and pleasant aroma to any room without being too overpowering. It\u2019s a delicate balance that many air fresheners fail to achieve, but Mrs. Meyer's has it down to a fine art. My spouse and I both agree - it smells wonderful!What sets Mrs. Meyer's Room and Air Freshener Spray apart is its ability to gently neutralize odors rather than just masking them with a strong fragrance. The resulting fresh and natural honeysuckle scent genuinely elevates the atmosphere in our home.In conclusion, Mrs. Meyer's Room and Air Freshener Spray hits all the right notes. It successfully combines effectiveness, environmental responsibility, and a wonderful fragrance. We're definitely eager to explore other scents in their range. This is a top-tier recommendation for anyone in search of a delightful and eco-friendly air freshener.",

The other floral smells like popuri but this one smells like honeysuckle, jasmine, and splash of citrus. Like all scented sprays, it doesn't mask odor, so take the trash out or it will smell like flowery trash.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this scent multiple times over the years because It had become my absolute favorite in their line of air fresheners. It has always been consistent in the way it smells...except for this purchase. Although it still has a fairly pleasant scent, it doesn't smell like the Honeysuckle that I had been accustomed to. This one smells more herbaceous and earthy, as opposed to having a floral fragrance. An entirely different experience. I don't use it as often because of this, and now I am a bit nervous about ordering it again and being disappointed that I will receive another one that does not smell like it should.",
