I smell the herby lavender (which I love) and another very strong flowery fragrance. I bought 2 for my 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment and I only need one turned all the way down. With 2 cats and a kid and myself during covid its become less than fresh around here at times. It definitely smells more natural than the original air wicks but one in my home is plenty. I do like the fragrance it's just a little overwhelming for someone sensitive to smells. I plugged it into a light switch so I can turn it off and on with the light maybe I can handle it this way. Right now I am wearing my mask and ventilating my apartment just to air it out a bit. Maybe they start very strong and lessen a tiny bit over time. I will update soon.",

Much too complicated to separate and no response when I asked. The refills are excellent, shame you can\u2019t buy them separately.",

Not only is this a beautiful light scent, you have the ability to choose the minimum and maximum exposure ranging from 1-5. I keep it on one but we are selling out home so I crank it to 5 for showing purposes and find even on 5 it's not unbearable for my sensitive nose. I tried the individual one first and everyone loved it so much that I got this bigger pack and we're loving the refreshing smell when we come in from anywhere. It's simply delightful!",
