This finally got rid of the smell. 4/5 stars because it didn't stick to inside of trash can lid (and didn't seem to be making any difference INSIDE the trash). We ended up sticking it on the top and then couldn't smell kitty poo anymore. Do be aware - it is extremely fragrant and strongly citrusy smelling which may bother some people I like it. And definitely prefer over poo. :-)",

                "reviewText": "I thought I would be able to use these on the lid of my trashcan as pictured on the product packaging. It fell off into the trashcan so would not recommend it for use on a trashcan lid. The item fell off into the trash after ensuring the lid was clean before applying and it was not full. The smell was an odd citrus smell. I cannot rate the product on how long it would last because I accidentally threw it away after just a couple of weeks on the trashcan lid. The product is also fairly large in size. I thought they would be a bit smaller. They are the size of your palm roughly. They are also not slim, about 3/4 to 1 inch thick.",

It has a slight odor but that's OK since it seems to work in reducing the food odors in the sealed kitchen garbage can. You only smell it if you stick your nose into the can.",

One of these stuck inside the top lid and another on the bottom below the trash bag helps a lot. And they're cheap and easy to use. Definitely a decent solution!",

I think I\u2019d have to put 4 in order to actually get a scent. I looked inside and they have very little of the gel that makes it smell. I think if they\u2019d fill it up a bit more this would be a better product. However, because of the price I really can\u2019t complain too much!",
