I contacted the 800 number on the can and have been ordering it directly from the company in Toronto Canada ever since. Now it is available on Amazon. I buy about 3 cans a year and so, even though it is expensive, we love it and feel it is definitely worth the money.",

That being said - the supply chain needs to be fixed as the price is currently at almost \u00a318 per can at the time of this review. Terrific product, but it simply doesn't justify the price.",
