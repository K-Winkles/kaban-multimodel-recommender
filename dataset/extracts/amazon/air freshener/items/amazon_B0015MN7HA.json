                "reviewText": "I read a lot of other reviews for this product and the biggest complaints were that it came shipped poorly and that it didn't \"work that well.\"Mine came wrapped in bubble wrapped and intact aside from a teeny tiny dent on the corner of the jar. No big deal.As for how this product actually works, I love this stuff. I had been buying the little jars of off-brand stuff and thinking they were just fine and this product is way, way better. Some people said stuff like \"I put it on a stinky rug and it worked ok but as soon as I took the air freshener out it still stunk like rug!\" Well, this will freshen the air and pull nasty stank out of a room, but it won't clean your carpet. Or your walls. Or your dog. Or your smoking roommate. It can't fix the source of the stank.But it works great for cooking odors or in a litterbox/dog bed room or in a musty closet that rarely gets used. It's an air freshener, not a cleaning service.Having a big jar is nice cause I can reuse the little jars I already bought and don't have to continually spend 5-15$ on new jars and throw all that extra plastic in the garbage (since it isn't recyclable in my area.)Some people also complained that it smelled too strongly. It is pretty strong fresh out of the jar but either due to your nose going blind to the smell or the product working that way as designed, after a couple hours you hardly notice it. It is a little strong but not chemical-y (some folks said it smelled like strong chemicals or Pine-Sol - I disagree but can't place what the scent actually is.)",

                "reviewText": "Best at neutralizing odors in every room in your house. Used to purchase in bed Bath and beyond, before they closed. Leaves of fresh odor in every room. Purchase the large size and fills at least four containers. I can tell when the containers are getting low. This product is great at neutralizing mold & mildew odor, as keeping general every day common household neutralized. I find this to be better than the ordinary floral, candle or springtime scents. The cost to long lasting performance is comparable to all of the others brand found in the grocery stores. Fresh Wave leaves a a wave of freshness for at least three to four months. This is a versatile, quality product that I highly recommend!!! Thanks FRESH WAVE!!\ud83d\udca6",

No longer smell on furniture whatsoever. In the car of smokers, boom. Smell gone. In the cabinet where spices or garbage reside, No odor. Love that it just absorbs the odor with no toxic chemicals and just dissipates over time. I can\u2019t imagine being without it!",

This product has a strong scent when you open the jar (doesn\u2019t bother me because i like essential oils), but it dissipates quickly when put into an open container. In one day I notice a difference. I cannot smell the litterbox anymore (it is cleaned every day!). There is no scent at all, just fresh and clean. I cannot stand perfume smells. This is so good, I put it in my Son\u2019s bathroom because he tends to keep the door only slightly ajar, and I can smell the moisture buildup. I will definitely buy this product again. I ordered, and receivedit, the same day.",
