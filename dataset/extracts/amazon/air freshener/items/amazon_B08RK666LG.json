                "reviewText": "Switching to Air Wick Plug Ins from B&BW wallflowers was key in keeping my house smell as cozy and fragranced as I can get it. Other brands scents wear off extremely fast and the refills cost more. Not only are the plug ins more affordable, the scents last sooo much longer. I can get 4-5 week of STRONG ACTIVE fragrance from them, whereas with others, the bold scent is much less noticeable after a week or so. The package does say up to 300 days of scent, but that must be on the lower settings. I typically keep my plug ins fully open (on setting 5), but with this scent I've been able to lower it to 3 or 4 because this scent is so strongly fragranced, in a good way. I've tried multiple scents (fresh scents, musky scents, ocean/water scents, and nature scents - (excluding pine/trees) are my go-to's) and this is exactly what I was looking for. It smells like a fresh dewey morning in a bamboo garden, I love this being the signature scent for my home, everyone compliments how good my house smells. Nothing more relaxing than coming home to a house that smells good, Air Wick itself and this scent in particular and are forever my home scent staple items!",

                "reviewText": "I just received and plugged these in. Perfect! I am VERY particular when it comes to scent since I can get headaches from scents. Unless I can smell these items in a store I tend to stick with what I\u2019ve used in the past. Anything floral is a no go so the name of this scent was a risk. After reading reviews I decided to try it. So glad I did. Things I like:- The scent is not overwhelming but fills the room with a spa-like scent - clean (not in a linen or detergent way) and refreshing.- scent can be used year around if you want. Spring, summer, fall or winter since it\u2019s just clean smelling.- you can smell it. I\u2019ve used other brands and noticed the \u201cthrow\u201d of the scent is limited and I\u2019d need several plugins in a room. Plus it seemed the others did not last long. For whatever reason those brands work great in my dad's assisted living apartment but in my house I could only smell it when close to the plug-in. Since I just received these I don\u2019t know if this scent will last 60 days, but based on how well they\u2019re working in this short time I have hope.I highly recommend. Give it a shot. I\u2019m ordering more!!!",
