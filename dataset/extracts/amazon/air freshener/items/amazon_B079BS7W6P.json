I realize that Clorox is well known for bleach and disinfecting the world over, however, in this case, they should stick to what they are known for. This product has no fragrance at all to it! Not even a small amount in my tiny bathroom. I cannot recommend this product to anyone. Maybe I got a bad batch. It\u2019s certainly possible. To be honest, I was shocked that such a big name had such a disappointing outcome so I\u2019m suspect of a bad batch, at least I hope so. I cannot believe they would sell such an inferior product.",
