I have a small dog who's potty trained to pee in those pee pads so obviously there will be urine odors in between changes. I find with traditional room spray it just masks and blends with the smell. Anyways, I opened it and left in a high shelf at the source of the smell and not even kidding.. within 25-30 minutes the smell is GONE. Whenever I do smell a little linger of odor, I shake the container a bit and POOF! Works miraculously well. 10/10.I will write back when I do have to make another purchase to see how long they last. The label says good up to 90 days but I'm sure it will be less than that..",

We still smell the smell in the sink and found out it\u2019s best to use white vinegar and baking soda to get rid of that. When you shake these jars, it does smell nice for about five minutes and then you don\u2019t smell it anymore. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just an air freshener but it does not clean anything in your sink if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. it does have a nice smell. It just doesn\u2019t do the job that I was looking for.",

The container SUUUCKS. It needs a better way of sealing it. The top falls off way too easy. I hit a bump on the road, the jar rolled and hit the ground and there were beads everywhere\u2026. It was frustrating because besides some dirt I keep a neat truck.I\u2019ve bought 3 of these and 2 of them the lid popped off and beads everywhere and the third was stolen when the truck was in the shop.This product needs a threaded lid upgrade and needs to be able to fit in a cup holder to make this product more vehicle friendly.",

Naturally, she has biological needs during the day which she takes care of on the pee pads. Needless to say, when we get home after work the room doesn\u2019t smell very pleasant. It smells like a kennel!! No matter how many candles we\u2019d burn the smell wouldn\u2019t go away. We purchased the Funkaway Bead product and NO MORE ODOR!!! Only took a few hours for the odor to be eliminated and the room stays fresh smelling all day-THANK YOU!!!",

It reminds me of those little scent things that you put in your car under the seat to help with smell and you just kinda hope for the best. However, this thing is powerful. I just recently adopted a new cat. He's about 8 months old now. His poops....good lord. Are terrible. I put this thing on my desk in my room, NO WHERE NEAR THE LITTER BOX and came home to my room smelling amazing. It's been weeks now and it's still going strong. I have ordered another one for my living room because I'm tired of being those little air wick things. You will NOT be disappointed in this!",
