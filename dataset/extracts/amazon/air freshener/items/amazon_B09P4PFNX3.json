One good spray of this in the air away from the pigs is enough to keep the room smelling like baby powder. I was concerned for the pigs' little lungs but they don't seem bothered by this. The odor masking of this spray is highly effective and I expect to use all 3 bottles. For my needs this is a great product and economical.",

Instead, just lightly pull back the 'trigger' and simply hold it and it will continually dispense the product at a nice, stable, suitable rate. It does not waste the product. The product covers smell well and lasts for 2-3 hours. I have sprayed it above a stinky mattress and 8 hours later, the mattress still smells fresh. I feel like I have used much product, but I have yet to empty a container of the product. I plan on buying these again when the ones I have run out. PS: Good to leave one within easy reach in the bathroom!",

Not just for animal odors, but also for an occasional cigarette smoker. I love the scent of this product and I find it works extremely well. This 3-pk was a better deal than I've seen in the stores. Thanks Amazon!!",
