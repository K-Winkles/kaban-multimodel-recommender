Unlike those simply rebrand generic bamboo charcoal bags, we have carefully crafted our activated charcoal to offer over 4 times the comprehensive adsorption capacity and cost-efficiency compared to traditional bamboo charcoal. The TRUTH About \"Recharge\" Charcoal bags \"recharged\" in sunlight do restore some adsorption capacity. However, some sellers say that \"Recharge\" the charcoal bag can make it last up to 2 or even 3 years, which is totally absurd. After you have \"Recharged\" your charcoal bag up to 2 times, we recommend stopping using it. Both activated carbon and bamboo charcoal require extremely high temperatures to fully restore their adsorption capacity. This process CANNOT be achieved through exposure to sunlight and necessitates the use of specialized equipment. How to Dispose of Wasted Activated Charcoal? We recommend burying the discarded activated charcoal into the soil, which will make the soil more fertile. Activated Charcoal Or Baking Soda? Activated charcoal adsorbs odor molecules in micropores within itself, which is a safe physical process.Baking soda relies on chemical reactions to neutralize odor molecules, which is a safe chemical process as well.",
