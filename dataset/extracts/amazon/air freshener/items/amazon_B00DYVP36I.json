                "reviewText": "This stuff is amazing! It smells so good and isn't artificial smelling or headache inducing. I am a caretaker for my husband who has cancer, and we find ourselves at the cancer center multiple times a week. The area where he gets his treatment is out of the way in a more secluded area of the building, with 2 single bathrooms off the beaten path of most foot traffic. Well, you know what happens in secluded bathrooms in a public space...I don't think I need to elaborate. Anyway, I live on coffee and have to pee a lot and I started really dreading going into the bathrooms nearby. I'm talking gag inducing stuff here. I got this because I didn't want to be spraying chemicals where cancer patients frequent and the size of the can is perfect for my purse. Now I hold my breath before I go into the bathroom and spray this quick in front of me. It takes care of any and all odors in an instant! No more dread and I love the fresh orange scent. So good! It's worth the money for me to keep everyone safe and not breathing in garbage, and it works so well, it's just worth it 100%. I will continue to buy this for at home too. Sometimes I spritz it not to cover anything up, but just because I love the smell of it.",

Then my husband saw them on Amazon.ca and we ordered the orange scent. He wants to throw out all of our other room deodorants, saying they are fake smelling and he hates them. So, I guess they will go into the garbage. The containers are smaller than I purchased before but isn't that the same with a lot of products these days. The scent is refreshing, not fake and definitely works for eliminating odors.",
