Beware the sprays will stain because of the citrus oils in it. The sprays also work to remove grease stains from laundry and will remove sticky labels easily. The company use to have a pamphlet with the products stating all the uses for citrus magic. Check it out..",

Definitely more odor absorbing than smelling though.I go to the gym often and try to clean the interior of my car 2x a month because it does eventually start smelling like a gym locker. Sometimes life gets in the way though so having these soak up the odors in between cleanings has been a great convenience.I do use 2 at a time for my sedan, 1 underneath each seat. I swap/stagger one of them out every 2-3 weeks and then just chuck that used one in my laundry basket.For under 10 bucks a month it's worth it for me. Don't have to come back to a smelly car/laundry basket",

We keep piles of puppy pads there and remove them quickly when used but inevitably some smell lingers. I'd given up hope of fixing that, as cat urine scent is very strong, but these have fixed that. They are long lasting and the scent is very pleasant. I highly recommend these and am so grateful for them.",
