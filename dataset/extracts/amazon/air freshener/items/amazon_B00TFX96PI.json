                "reviewText": "The smell is perfect - I love this scent! I use them in the tops of trash cans to help with the smell. It works great for the kitchen trash, but in the babies poopy pails, it only adds lavender scent mixed with poopy diapers. However, that is no fault of the product, just some very potent diapers.",
