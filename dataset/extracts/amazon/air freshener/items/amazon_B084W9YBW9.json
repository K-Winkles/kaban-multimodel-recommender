Honestly, he's not the worst offender in our house-- our two sons are-- but I figured my husband could try them first and, if they work well, we could buy more for our other bathrooms.We have used Poo-Pourri in the past, but what I don't like about it is that the pumps leak a bit, so your hands end up wet/oily and smelling like the product, even after washing your hands. I even got it on my clothes once, which meant I had to specifically treat the stain.Anyway, my husband started using these in our WC in the master bath, and I noticed that it smelled like laundry detergent in there. I was confused for a minute because I don't have any cleaning or air freshening product that smelled like that, until I remembered the Dude Bombs.Long story short, they work, and the scent does linger a bit but smells SO much better than Poo-Pourri! I have purchased these to stock in our other two bathrooms.",

So, we got these. The scent isn't that great, yes, it's better than poo smell and it helps, but personally it's not a very refreshing scent, its nasty. But, the biggest complaint is it leaves a blue ring in the toilet. If you remember to double flush, hurray, the blue goes away, if you forget, you are stuck scrubbing the sides of your bowls. Personally I feel there are better products out there, won't buy again.",

                "reviewText": "We use a spray at home for this purpose, but my son didn't want to take that to college, as they are more floral. I figured these were worth a try - and he loves them. He's in a suite with 3 other boys, so he's happy masking his \"business\" without worrying about getting teased too much for the product smell. The bag lasted him a couple of months, so we're putting it on our permanent college shopping list for him. The bag is fairly small, so he can easily stow it in his cupboard or dresser.",

Si tuviera que poner un contra ser\u00eda qu\u00e9 hay que hacer la descarga del agua dos veces ya que puede quedar un poco manchado de azul, y ese azul si no se remueve pronto despu\u00e9s hay que tallar para quitarlo, de ahi en fuera todo excelente.",
