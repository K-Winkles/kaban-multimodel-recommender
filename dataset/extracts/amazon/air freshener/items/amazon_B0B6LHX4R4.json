Im not expecting miracles it obviously only freshens up the area it is in. That being said. Its definitely worth purchasing multiple for different rooms. The smell is only prominent from time to time. Its not that strong all the time. Which i think is a good thing.",

Heater is strong at first, warm to touch. After a week, it\u2019s lost its mojo. Will be trying some other solutions. Note leaving the oil containers sitting out with caps off produces a small bit consistent scent.",
