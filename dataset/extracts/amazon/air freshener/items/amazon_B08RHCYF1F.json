                "reviewText": "I have never been able to handle Febreeze. No matter the scent used, it was simply too strong for my lungs to handle. I felt as if someone had put a plastic bag over my head whenever I was in the same room where someone had sprayed this stuff.So when I saw Febreeze LIGHT in the store, I was a bit hesitant. I love the smell, but I hate the asthma attacks that always follow this stuff. After much going back and forth, I decided to chance it and bought a bottle to bring home.I was pleasantly surprised to find that this scent was very light and airy. It smells good, but at the same time it does not overwhelm you and take your breath away. It worked well to eliminate the odors from the litterboxes, and even took away the smoke smell on my stepson's clothes when he visited. I like to use it in the winter time when the house gets a bit 'stuffy' smelling from not being able to have the windows open. My husband now carries a can with him in his bag. He is a truck driver and the day shift people tend to smoke in the cab. He uses the Febreeze to eliminate the smoke smell so that he can breathe. The fact that you can also get two cans in one package is great also. One for him, and one for me.",
