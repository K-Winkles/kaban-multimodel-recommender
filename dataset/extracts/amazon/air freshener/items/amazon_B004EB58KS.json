                "reviewText": "If you are looking for a product to simply over power an area with a strong fragrance without care whether it actually neutralizes nearby odors then this product isn't for you (go by a plug in oil warmer instead.) This doesn't generate a strong scent. This appears to be primarily sodium chlorite in glycerol solution, slowly dissolves then reacts to release chlorine dioxide vapors to breakdown nearby odor molecules. This needs some degree of air flow, so don't put it in your garbage can put a bag over it and expect that it will neutralize the odors, nor is it practical to put it in bottom of a clothes hamper then bury it with clothes and expect it to do miracles. Place it next to the garbage or hamper instead. If you are using this to mask odors coming from your air vents, keep in mind that leaving it over a hot air return will cause it to get used up faster. Similarly this is not a substitute for a potpourri pot and is not best located next to a fireplace. After 3.5 weeks just over half the containers contents have broken down and been used up. If I'm lucky this will last a max of 7 weeks in total. 49 days is considerably far off from 60 to 90 days. It effectively eliminates odors in a limited proximity (3-4' radius from placement in all directions.) The closer to odor source the better, or try to centralize its placement for largest area of coverage (far less effective tucked in corner of room on floor unless that is the source of odor.) In general I think it is a far stretch to think this will last anyone 60-90 days. In a small closed off closet kept at 60degrees (or lower) this may last a little longer then 49 day (reach 60 days,) but for most practical placement applications it will be used up long before 60 days.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve ordered this product a total of three times. The first time I received it, it was amazing. I followed the directions and ended up putting it under the back of my front passenger\u2019s seat. For a good two months, I could smell the freshness every time I got in my car. So I ordered it again and the freshness was gone in a week or so. I didn\u2019t let that discourage me. We live in a world of mass produced products. There\u2019s bound to be some duds out there. Then when I got the same lack luster performance when I ordered the product for the third time, that was disappointing. Now I\u2019m thinking I need to just move on to something else. I don\u2019t want to gamble anymore on whether or not I\u2019ll get the great experience and product I had when I originally ordered this air freshener.",
