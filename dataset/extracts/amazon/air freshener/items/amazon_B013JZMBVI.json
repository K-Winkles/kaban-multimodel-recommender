                "reviewText": "The scent smells amazing, kind of like when you are outside and you walk by someone's house and you can smell that they are doing laundry. My mother comes over to my house and she says she can smell the scent 5 feet before she hits the front door and my sister-in-law told me that my garage smelled like crazy amazing... crazy amazing enough, I don't have one in my garage. The Airwick plug in has 5 different settings that controls how strong the scent is. In my living room and bigger areas I put the setting on 3 so that it pumps enough snuggle scent out to cover the entire space, but in smaller rooms like bedrooms, I have it on the lowest setting. I have noticed that in smaller areas, the scent does get trapped and becomes a little too strong. After a little bit, you do get used to the smell. I turned mine up a little bit so that I could smell it again. I went on vacation and came back and my house almost choked me out. I would keep that in mind for company. I wouldn't turn them up because just because you can't smell it, doesn't mean your guests won't. These plug ins don't last as long as I would like, that is why I am giving it 4 stars. If you have the setting on 3 or higher, they only last like 2 weeks. If you have it lower, I would say about 3. I do have one of these plug ins near my closet, and when I have gone on trips and opened my bag, I can DEFINITELY smell the snuggle scent has gotten to my clothes. I don't really mind though, because it smells like clean laundry, so it is a win win.",
