I have this product being used in my living room. For the first few days, the scent is strong and noticeable. After about 10 or so days, the scent is practically gone. Overall, great product, I just wished it lasted longer!",

I love this fall scent, however, don't set your plugin to max when you plug this scent in or it smells absolutely WAY too strong. It will attack your nose and smell like a barbeque from hell. After I set my plugins to low it was the perfect level and resumed its sweet fall scenting.",
