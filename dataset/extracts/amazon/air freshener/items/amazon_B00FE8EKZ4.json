                "reviewText": "Couple of years ago I bought this exact product. The scent lasted from the day I bought it in December and lasted till late June. I used it in my trunk where I keep my daily journey books. I bought this expecting the same level of quality. The scent is FAR fainter than it used to be but still running good. Though, the one in use dried out quite quickly even if it is giving a faint smell",

So, we need to mask that odor all the time. These little gems are fantastic for that purpose and the evergreen scent is perfect for the mountain environment.",
