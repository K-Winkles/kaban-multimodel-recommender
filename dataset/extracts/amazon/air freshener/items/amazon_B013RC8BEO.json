                "reviewText": "I love this product. Plain and simple it smells great without being overpowering, sprays \u201ccleaner\u201d meaning it doesn\u2019t leave a ton of residue or sticky \u201cgunk\u201d like a bigger name brand product I used to use, Febreze (am I allowed to say their name?). The other main reason I\u2019ve \u201cconverted\u201d to Mrs Meyers are the wide array of more delicate fragrances available which all smell great and actually do a better job of eliminating odors rather than just masking. What I\u2019ve found is that for heavier odors, Febreze would require multiple uses. Meaning, I would spray quite heavily several times, return to the room with the odors and find that the odors still remain, requiring another series of repeated sprays. Contrast this to Mrs Meyers where several sprays eliminates the odors and when I return to the room find it does not need a secondary series of sprays.",
