                "reviewText": "There is an odd smell in my mudroom that is amplified in the summer. Last year I purchased these in the Original Scent. At first the scent was overpowering and not so great, but it dissipated and they definitely absorbed the negative odor. I decided to try the Lemon Scent this summer and I love it! It is very strong in the beginning and does fade, but it does what it's supposed to do, absorb bad odors. It does not cover up odors with another scent, which is why the scent fades. I have started using these in the lobby of my doggie daycare which obviously can smell very \"doggie\" and they really help! Love that it is a natural product too!",

                "reviewText": "See the end for an update 081722\u2026I got it based on a review on a Litter Robot page review. I expected it to magically remove any odor based on the review. It does smell fresh & good & I put all 3 of them in the closet I have the litter box in. With a litter robot the odor pretty much goes away after it cycles, but in the lapse of time between use & cycling (set at 3 minutes) it can stink up a storm. (Still better than a manual litter box because that stinks until you physically clean it.) One kitty tries to cover his poop but never quite does. The litter robot I love, that\u2019s my only challenge, but it\u2019s a big one for me as my clothes are at the other end. It\u2019s a small apartment and it\u2019s the only logical place for it to be.Still glad I have the 3 odor removing gels for general odor but febreeze works better. I\u2019m just not always around to spray it. Would I buy them again for this specific use? Maybe not. I\u2019ll know for sure when they evaporate all the gel and see then if it made a difference. Anyone have a better resource?For a bathroom or kitchen, I think they\u2019ll work better.Update: I put the containers inside the front of my litter robot drawer, in front of the bag. I really think that relocation helped with the freshener\u2019s effectiveness. Try it, see if it works for you.",
