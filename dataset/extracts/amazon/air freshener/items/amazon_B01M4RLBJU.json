                "reviewText": "I got this spray for our bathrooms. We have a bathroom odor issue with a family member who has colon problems (sorry, TMI, I know). This spray definitely clears the bad poo odors but replaces it with an overly scented artificial flowery, chemical smell. It's not terrible, it's just STRONG. It's still embarrassing for the family member to come out of the bathroom still trailing a (different) toxic cloud. We've experimented with spraying just a little - a spritz - but that's not enough to clear the poo smell. I still prefer using this spray over others that try to cover the smell without eliminating it. Make sense? I hope so.I AM going to purchase this product again - in a different scent - and see if that is better. If you have a difficult odor problem - by all means, try this, it will definitely help. You may even like this scent - Heavy Duty - Crisp Clean in which case you'll be very happy and give it a full 5 stars across the board. I just personally need a little less 'toxic waste ebatement' and a little more 'fresh laundry & spring flowers'.PS - If you give the bathroom (or wherever) a heavy spray, it does last a good long time.",

You don\u2019t need to use a lot so I find that it lasts longer than other air fresheners I\u2019ve tried. I would recommend using it if you\u2019re looking for a pleasant smell along with effective air freshening. Obviously the opinion on a \u201cpleasant scent\u201d is subjective and everyone has different tastes. If you\u2019re looking for something overpowering, fruity or woody then this isn\u2019t the air freshener for you, but if you are looking for something with a mild aroma yet is effective enough to remove the smell cigarette smoke in a room that is about 12\u2019 x 20\u2019 feet, then this is for you. I use cigarette smoke for illustration purposes because that\u2019s what I use this for, but you could use it to get rid of any odor you don\u2019t care for.",

                "reviewText": "Ok, I'm really going to say this is about a 4.5. Febreze, Lysol, and Nature's Miracle pet enzyme remover make our household go around. And even if it didn't, I'd probably keep buying this just because my daughter likes to run around the house spraying it as she proclaims it to be her superpower. Normally, we buy it at Costco, but life happens, we were running out, and I wasn't going to be able to set foot in a store conveniently for a few days, so I ordered from Amazon.There were no condition issues with the product we received. I'm saying it's a 4.5 because it's no match for Nature's Miracle...meaning, you can still smell both of their pet enzyme products I own after liberally dousing it with this febreze product, so it may not eliminate all smells. I happen to really like the smell of the new citrus nature's miracle we purchased, but I've gotten really burnt out on the smell of the other stuff, and my husband ordered us a second gallon of it, not realizing I was sick of the smell and we already had one sitting in the cupboard. Naturally, I'd rather smell this, since I actually really like the smell of this particular febreze product. But no luck...it didn't even dent the Nature's Miracle armor. Which is great for getting rid of cat pee, bad if you don't like the smell of the enzyme remover. So, just be prepared...it will help with the vast majority of odors you find unpleasant, but not all of them.I haven't had any problems with these particular cans, but I purchase the same type of spray cans from Costco, and every now and then something goes wrong in the spray mechanism and you end up with a mostly full bottle of febreze you can't access safely or use. Otherwise, we love this product, and it's a great super power for dealing with some of the stink life can throw your way.",
