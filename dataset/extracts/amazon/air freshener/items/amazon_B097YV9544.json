But the Citrus Orange is awful!! It does not have a light orange scent! I did a short spray and then got a whiff of it\u2026I started coughing and gauging! It doesn\u2019t smell like oranges to me at all!!! I realize that for others this may be a refreshing smell. But be aware, this is non-returnable!!! (Which I could swear when I ordered it said it was\u2026 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) That is part of the reason for only one star!!!",
