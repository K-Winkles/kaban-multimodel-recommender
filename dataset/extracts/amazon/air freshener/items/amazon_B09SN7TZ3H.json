                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying I am VERY smell sensitive and cannot stand so many smells! So I was a bit skeptical if I would like it....and wondered if it would work on my carpet. I have a tiny dog and hate my carpet to smell like a dog. First, it smells AMAZING. Very natural with a hint of lemon with a light woodsy smell when dry, maybe sandalwood. It's a very nice natural smell when sprayed and when dry. It sprays out in a fine mist, which is nice and allows for good area coverage. It has no residue...I sprayed in on my hand first and is not sticky or oily. Dries feeling like nothing at all. It's been an hour and carpet still smells so nice! If it lasts (just sprayed it today) I will always use it and keep it on hand and be a lifelong customer :). I love that it's natural, non toxic with safe plant based ingredients. I would definitely recommend for an air freshener or for pets.",
