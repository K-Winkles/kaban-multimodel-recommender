Never had cranberry scented room before but it\u2019s perfect for the season. Apple cider is most pleasant also but not as strong a scent as the cranberry. Third can is my essential extra strong Fabrize that I count on when my dogs are extra smelly. (Works fine until I can get them into their bath.)
