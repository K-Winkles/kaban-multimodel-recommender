Only issue I have is that the scent makes me feel sleepy when I'm in bed reading books too. I noticed a decrease in my anxiety after I put this in my bedroom.So while that was good I can't feel sleepy all day too! I just put this in the linen closet so I'll only catch the scent when I open the door. You could move this around, keeping it in the bedroom at night and in a linen closet during the day. I don't know. Yawn...Since I've only been using this for a few days I just noticed I'm tired during the day when I read in my room! Whatever lavender fragrance is in this it makes me too sleepy during the day.I am not a doctor. This review is not medical advice. Please consult with your doctor if you have any issues with sleepiness during the day!~The Rebecca ReviewP.S. This is working in the linen closet. It scents up the entire closet nicely!",

I know these are the light version, but if I had it to do over again I would certainly pick a regular strength and a different scent.",

                "reviewText": "Scent is not overpowering, you just realize after the fact that it smelled pleasant. I have an allergy to chemicals and this does NOT bother me at all!!! Which is fantastic!!!! Great for use in kitchen (which is small) and bathroom (also small). Use in storage/pantry which has no air source except when door opened so gets very stale in there, but not now. Would recommend and will continue buying.",
