The Pure Citrus sprays a very fine mist that stays airborn longer than the larger droplets that this pump spray puts out. I've found two more uses for the Meyers air freshener - it will stop the squeak in a door hinge and smells a heck of a lot better than WD-40 and it also dissolved some sticky residue from something I had removed a label from. So an all around useful thing to have at hand.",
