Air wick, they won't work if it's not their brand. Their prices are good and the batteries last a pretty good amount of time even if you have them set to go off very often.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to help cover the smell of a litter box. It works okay. Came packaged great and undamaged. Easy to put it together and it came with batteries. The smell itself it very pleasant and the design of the sprayer looks great and is not an eye sore. It has 3 different time settings; 9 minutes, 18 minutes and 36 minutes. I really wish it had more, longer timed settings but I keep mine on 36 and it works fine. There is also an option to turn it off if you wish. It really helps in covering foul odors and giving a room a fresh, pleasant smell. The spray itself is not silent and is actually decently loud. With no tv or music on, I can hear when it sprays from the complete opposite end of my house. I have gotten used to the sound over time. The scent container/can lasts for a very long time despite going off so many times a day. It lasted well over a month. The only complaint I have about this sprayer is that if it is not positioned correctly, it will leak and stain whatever it is set on. I set it on a top shelf to spray mid air. However, I found if it is not on the edge spraying into the air, the scent liquid will land right on the surface in front of the sprayer and will stain if it is delicate wood. Also, when it starts to run low in the can, it also leaks. Had to find that out the hard way unfortunately. As far as covering scents, it works great. But with the damage it caused to my furniture, I will no longer be using it.",
