I wish it would not cover up TWO inlets each time I plug one of them in. Finally, sometimes after plugging them in, they tilt out a bit from the inlet. Making me wonder if it is REALLY plugged it and if it is going to keep a good electrical connection. Because without a good electrical connection it will not work. Maybe it is just the old apartment I live in. Many newer houses do not have this problem. I guess it does not bother me too much as this is the second time I have bought these.
