It may be \"100% natural propellant, and is made without phthalates, parabens, formaldehyde, nitro musks or dyes,\" but it is absolutely horrible!First, it is weaker and inferior to Fabreze! It is NOT 2x as fragrant, if anything it is 1/2 as fragrant and only lasts a couple of minutes IF you spray onto some surface and leave it dry there (but then you have to clean up the residue).Second, it is more of a squirt or spray than a spritz. It leaves big drops on the floor if you attempt to spray it into the air, which is why I said to spray it onto some surface, that you can later wipe up.The original aerosol of this Bubbly Berry Splash was outstanding! This new \"invention\" is absolutely worthless!DO NOT BUY IT!DO NOT BUY THE OTHER NEW GLADE PRODUCTS, EITHER!",

It\u2019s a smell that is not offensive but light enough to be feminine. So far I have only been able to find this scent online.",

Straight up bug spray. 2 stars though because, if you like bug spray (and who am I to judge?), you'll love it.",
