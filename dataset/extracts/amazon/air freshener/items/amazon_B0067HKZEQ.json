                "reviewText": "I really feel these are falsely advertised. The fragrance used in them is NOT naturally derived. That being said, the fragrance is not totally overwhelming like, say a glade plug-in, would be. I found I was okay with the fragrance as long as I placed the air freshener somewhere up high, away from areas I usually occupy.But, if you are sensitive to synthetic fragrances please be aware that these contain them and steer clear.I think these do a decent job overall at eliminating odor- I've used them near the litter boxes and they definitely seem to help and last awhile.I've started using white vinegar mixed with a bit of naturally scented fabric softener to freshen the air and linens and have been having pretty good results with that. And I've started using charcoal pouches and cedar sachets near the litter box. I think, in the long run, I prefer to go all-natural and leave these air fresheners behind.",
