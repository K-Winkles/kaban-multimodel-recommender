                "reviewText": "I just received this auto sprayer.This is the V880D programmable unit. As most that have purchased this they\u2019re putting it on a wall or on a table I am doing something different. I live in S Fl and as most here have central AC so i thought where would be the best place to put this to cover the whole house.I installed this inside the AC return. I love that its programable as i do not have to open return to turn on or off. it fills the house with a mild not overwhelming fragrance. I did have the Glade unit but didn\u2019t like how all you could do was set it to 9,18, 36 min sprays. So i opted to spend a-little more and I\u2019m glad i did. This SVAVO unit is so much better in so many ways and is built to last.I had no problem programming it as i did Download the manual before receiving it but all in all very straight forward. I use the Glade cans and they fit perfectly. I can not speak for other spray cans as i only use glade but what i read Air wick will fit fine. Now for the pros/ Cons.pros;Very easy to program and it has alot of options to choose to get it tailored to your liking.Very well built look more like a commercial product then a flimsy home unit. Looks like it will accept most brands of sprays. Gives you a red/ green led warning when it\u2019s going to spray as not to spray in you face. As this not mentioned anywhere and i think it would be good to mention that when you have to change battery\u2019s you will NOT loose your settings. By not putting that in manual is a Con.Cons;I wish it would show the spray count on the main screen instead of having to scroll thru menu to see it.I learned this from another buyer but when programming, program the features first then the time and day. Don\u2019t know why but it works.As i do look at reviews but not always to make my final decision to buy or not it helps. As for this product the good out way the bad by a long shot. I do feel that there are some legitimate issues with some units but I think a lot has to do with human error.I feel this is a very well made product and hope to get many year\u2019s out of it, as long as we don\u2019t have a shortage of air fresheners LOL \ud83d\ude29",

Step by step, patiently; and still the functions are confusing and do not work, The instruction differ slightly from the actual program buttons. Finally, I hit reset for factory settings and let it spray as were the cheaper model. Then the spray can button broke off. Now, I have a can of room spray that I must manually press and have no automatic system. Hope I can get my money back.",

                "reviewText": "I've used the National brand dispensers for years. I go thru about 3 cans of fragrance a month and I find them to be battery eaters. So with fragrance and batteries I'm spendings between $180 and $200 per year. That's $14. a month + battery cost. The dispensers micro spray about 80 times per day on the medium setting whether I'm at home or not.These although seem expensive, I have three for a cost of $84. You can program these so mine work 10 hours a day while I'm at home. 30 micro sprays a day so a can of fragrance should last almost 3 months. So first year cost with fragrance and batteries will be about $140. Up to $60 less than I spend now, and 2nd year my cost will only be about $60. for fragrance and batteries if I buy the 4 pk Airwick from Amazon for $15.30.",
