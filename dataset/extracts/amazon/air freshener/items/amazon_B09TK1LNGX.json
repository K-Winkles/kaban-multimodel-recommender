I use on skate insoles and safety pads.2. It comes out a heavy spray so just quickly spray my stuff, not wanting to overuse/saturate, doesnt seem to need to be sopping wet (like they suggest) to be effective (so far)3. Ingredients seemingly are Acetone and ethenol? I take my insoles out bc i dont want to damage the leather inside my skates, it might eat away at any adhesives used or nylon/synthetic threads. Just erring on the side of caution.4. I left in bag in car.It was cold.When i twist unlocked the spray nozzle it released pressure and sprayed me in the face, glad i had eyewear on!So.... beware of temperature changes and point away. Its been a bit leaky at nozzle the last use. Ill keep an \"eye\" on it (badda-bump!)Overall no complaints and currently all positive. Just seeing how long it will take b4 i need to wash my gear again!?Might try the other squeeze pump style next time instead of pressurized aerosol :)*Adding, just bought a bottle of the pump style :)",

                "reviewText": "My sneakers had a bad smell after I stepped in a puddle with them and I couldn't get rid of the smell. I tried some disinfectant spray, baking soda and a different shoe odor spray I already owned but nothing worked so I bought this. I took off the laces, opened up the tongue, then gave the sneakers a good spray and left them open with the spray soaking in for 48hrs. At first I thought the spray had just masked the bad odor since it has a really strong \"fresh\" smell which I'm not the biggest fan of, however the \"fresh\" smell went away after a few wears and the bad smell that was previously plaguing the shoes never came back so that's a win for me.",

                "reviewText": "This was a product a crime scene clean up guy uses in YouTube. I figured if it can take the funk out of crime scene it can handle the funk out of my new apartment. It was quite funky from the previous tenant and it's neighbor just general stinks, smoking and pet oders. I spray my air return, vents and each room once a week because I am too afraid to unscrew the vents beacuse they don't seem to be very secure. I ordered it August 30 after others just worked for an hour or two. This spray last a week and now as of December 2nd the smell completely gone. I am sure if I would have taken off the vents and sprayed inside of them the smell would have been gone a lot faster. I also had a friend come over and she had a pre-roll joint. It was rainy outside and I allowed her to smoke it inside. After she left it was still in the air. I sprayed the area where she sat and the fabric chair and the smell was gone. Under the bathroom sink has a must smell and I sprayed under there a couple of times a few says apart and the smell is gone. Great product worth every penny.",

I tried many ideas on how to get rid of the smell but it's bacteria your dealing with. You do need to wash the shoes in the machine first. I took a few online tips removing the insoles, adding scent boosters and soaking it for a bit in cold water. then wash on delicate with some towels.After that follow the directions I have done it twice so far and it's pretty much gone but as with every product, you need to do for a few times.Love it and you won't be disappointed I should have gone with this as my first choice after reading many online reviews not just what is written on amazon. Hopefully, I can get my money back on the other products.",
