I love the scent and wanted to keep my car smelling fresh so I ordered these after the other ones lost their scent after about 5 months. No idea if these will last that long although they appear to be identical to the olds ones. It's important to know that these require some airflow around them to really work. You can smell them a little if you've got your windows up(if you've placed them under the seats as per the instructions), but once you crack the windows or turn your HVAC system up you'll really smell them. Will definitely buy again if I ever burn through all of the ones I just bought. It's not new car smell but it's close enough for me.",
