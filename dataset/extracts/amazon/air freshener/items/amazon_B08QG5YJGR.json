                "reviewText": "I bought a couple febreeze plug-ins that came with the default \u201clinen & sky\u201d scent. I have to say, my house smelled AWFUL that evening, almost like a porta-potty. A clean porta-potty, but still. Even on the lowest setting, we all had headaches and had to unplug them. I promptly ordered this scent as I\u2019ve used it before in the portable air freshener format. It smells great! It\u2019s subtle and keeps the house smelling fresh.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m the only one who experiences this, but I feel like the warmer itself don\u2019t last too long. The refills obviously will last, depending on how much you\u2019re using it and on which setting, but I feel like the warmer itself eventually stops warming at a certain extent and doesn\u2019t give off that fragrant smell as it would when you first purchase one of these. Good for the money it\u2019s worth however and quality. Easy to use and basically runs itself once plugged into a wall outlet. I would recommend maybe getting two of these, placing them on lower settings if you have a larger space to cover such as an apartment and a few smaller ones for enclosed spaces such as bathrooms or closets. My front door to my loft is a little far from the living area so me or guests smelling the fragrance upon entering lets me know they are working and keeping the house smelling good. :)",

Besides the light is essentially the same design they had for years. There is a button on top you can slide to adjust the scent output, I tend to keep it in between the bathroom and living room. I place the bottom on top to the middle position and both rooms usually stay fresh smelling that way. Also i keep one near my garbage can to mask any smell prior to it feeling up and it does the trick. I would recommend this product when people come by my place they always say my house smells good.",

                "reviewText": "My husband hated the smell of this one so I put the lavender ones in and he liked those ones. This smell is pretty strong and artificial so I can understand why he wasn\u2019t a fan. I was okay with it because it did get rid of the the smells of dog and a musty smell that came into a spare room this spring. My husband said it gave him a headache as soon as he walked into the house and if I tried to plug it in without telling him he knew almost immediately! If someone is sensitive to this scent or dislikes it, it\u2019s a strong scent and the sensitivity is legit. I even tried putting it in the furthest corner of the house and turning it on low while he was sleeping to see if he would be okay if he was accustomed to it- nope \ud83d\udc4e! Whatever they put in this is like the smell of evil to my hubby \ud83d\ude06 it\u2019s not an awesome smell imo, it\u2019s okay, but definitely not worth a fuss.Be aware if you have company over that they might be sensitive to it as well, increasingly people have more scent allergies so it\u2019s important to be aware that the strong scents can cause serious distress.If you have a bunch of teenage boys or something this might be good for a lot of smelly guys who don\u2019t care about hygiene or if you have a smell you\u2019re trying to fight that\u2019s pretty toxic this could be the lead toxic of two options lol \ud83d\ude02I got it because it was on sale, I will never buy it again and had to shower off after disposing of the scent unit before my husband would come near me again \ud83d\ude06 the smell does get in your hair and things!",
