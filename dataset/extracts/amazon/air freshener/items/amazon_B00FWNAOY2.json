Adds to the cozy feeling during cold nights.1) The product is very strong and can cover a good size space.2) It last for several days. However, I think you will have to replace each one after about 2 weeks or so. I don't think they last for 30 days. Maybe it last longer if you don't have the plugin set in high.3) If you like a nice fall scent, you will love this. It isn't too overbearing. Guys that are looking for a scent that is nice and works well with a guys apartment or house, this would be a good choice.I recommend this.",

                "reviewText": "If you live in a condo building or perhaps an apartment you know how smells can travel from one unit to the other. A good solution as to not have those smells in your place, or at least to mask them is to use heated air fresheners or oils.I have been using the Glade Plugins for several years now, and am always impressed by how well they work, and how great they make my place smell. The \"cashmere\" fragrance is one of my favorite of those that I have tried. Doesn't smell like a holiday fragrance, and doesn't smell like a can air freshener since those can smell very \"flowery\", which is not to my taste.If there is a negative to the Glade Plugins is that they don't seem to last very long, or perhaps it's just me losing track of time. Either way, they are worth the money, and Amazon can get them to you fast. Just make sure that you buy or already have the warmer too!",
