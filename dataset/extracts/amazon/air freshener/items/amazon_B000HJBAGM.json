Sticking with wall fragrances that has proven to be tried and true. Expensive mistake that won't happen again.",

I have been having problems with odor in my house, so I thought I would give one a try. I found this particular scent, Ocean Mist, and it was priced on Amazon for only .40 cents! What a great price in order to try the product out! When I got it, there is a date on the outside, which was 4 months ago, and it doesn't say if it's an expiration date or a manufacture date, but if it's an expiration date, that would explain why it was marked down.When I got it, I thought it stuck to the bottom of the filter in the air handler with a double sided tape or something, but it turns out, it actually dangles from a supplied \"S\" hook.One side of it has a VERY cheap and brittle pressed paper board backing, which you have to punch out slots that allow for air flow. It was hard to get out, and came off in small pieces, which was a pain in the neck, pulling at these little pieces of the paper. After getting them off, I hung it from the bottom of my filter, and that is when I discovered that with my particular air handler, I couldn't attach it and then put it in the air handler, because my filter slides in at the bottom of my air handler very tightly, and there is no space for it to \"dangle\" when putting the filter in. So in order to put in on, I had to go in through my air return, which fortunately, in my situation, it is large and easy to reach in, after taking out all the screws.So on to the scent. In my opinion, this scent STUNK. I removed it and hopefully the smell will dissipate soon, because it stinks, in my opinion! It does have a \"scratch and sniff\" thing on the front of the package, but that doesn't help me when I'm ordering it through Amazon.So, I rated this 3 stars based on the fact that it is made with the cheap paper backing that easily tears into pieces when it is being removed, the difficulty I had, in my situation, with installing it, and the fact that it smells so bad. I would consider buying this product again in a different scent, buy I would be hesitant, since I disliked this scent so much.This was Made in the U.S.A. .",
