I will say to make sure that you have the proper warmer for this to go in to though, because it won't fit in the original one I was hoping to put it in. I ended up having to use a white plastic one at my office instead of the pretty one my husband got me for the house. You definitely can't go wrong with this scent though. It's definitely noticeable without being overpowering. I just wish I'd gotten this in a bigger pack!",

                "reviewText": "These two glade plugins are delightful, with a beautiful floral scent that lasts a long time. The Glade brand is a solid one, and my original plugin oil warmer has been working for close to a decade. They're really reliable and at a great price. This set is wonderful, but the price is higher than the pair of refills in my local grocery store; so, unless you're looking for this specific scent, that might be a better value. I'm a big fan of the Glade brand and I'd recommend this scent for anyone who enjoys a floral scent.",

                "reviewText": "Using this Orchid & Neroli scent refill in our laundry room which also houses the litter box for our two cats. Yep, that room gets stinky, but this Glade refill is doing a great job keeping the room fresh smelling with a pleasant floral scent. It's a pretty strong scent and we are able to keep the unit set to lowest setting and still works well.",

                "reviewText": "Glad brand is well known, and it has never let me down. The quality is great as expected BUT what I found out this time, that I had never noticed before is what this product is free from. This product is made without: PHTHALATES, PARABENS, FORMALDEHYDES, and NITRO MUSKS! I usually only use these Glade plug ins when I have visitors because I thought they weren't super healthy but now, I feel safer using them more often.",
