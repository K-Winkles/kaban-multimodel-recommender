                "reviewText": "I\u2019m happy I discovered the Glade Automatic Air Freshener Spray Holder! I had no idea such existed! I researched what filled the holder & found this set of 2 on Amazon for the unbeatable price of $8.48 at the subscribe & save cost. One refill easily is placed in the holder, the holder is closed & you are good to go! There\u2019s a touch tab on the top of the holder to test the spray. This can also be used if you want to give your room an extra boost of scent when you enter. These refills are full of a wonderful clean linen scent! I have one in my bathroom & one in my laundry room. What a noticeable difference these make! Having the setting placed on 36 minutes is sufficient enough for me & enough to fill the room with a long lasting scent. Each room no longer has that dull odor upon entering. It says if you have it set on 36 minutes one will last 60 days. If you want the spritz to come out sooner you can set it at 9 or 18 minutes rather than the 36 minutes. I initially had it set on 18 & found there was too much scent ruminating around the room. 36 minutes is just right. I\u2019ve tried the plug-in odor eliminators & the sit gel kind & they never produced much scent. These are easy to use & full of life! I was concerned about residue left on the floor from the spritz coming out but I\u2019ve thoroughly checked & not once have I noticed anything left behind after a few hours in a room. This is a genius product by Glade that is affordable & economical. The product is recycled which is even better. Based on my experience I highly recommend!",

The scent doesn't last long but I find it still does the job. Try it out for yourself and draw your own conclusions. Depending on where you live, it might be cheaper locally. Where I live, it's a little more expensive than on Amazon.",
