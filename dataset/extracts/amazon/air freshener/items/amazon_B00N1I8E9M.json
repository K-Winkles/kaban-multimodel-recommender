Cost less than a dollar if buy a pack of 6 or 12Cons:- I wish they had multi-pack with difference fragrance in the same set",

                "reviewText": "So, we own three rabbits. After a while, their cages smell pretty bad from their liter boxes. Honestly, all I have to do is open up one of these little guys and before long, you cannot even TELL we have bunnies in the room! It just smells like raspberry candy. Wish they didn't dry out so quickly, but they are inexpensive enough that it's not TOO much of a worry!",
