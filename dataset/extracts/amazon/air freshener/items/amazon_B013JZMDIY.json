As I said I use them in my bathroom and every time someone uses my bathroom they comment about how lovely it smells!!! It works so well because they are in a smaller sized enclosed room...I think that if it was in a different room or larger etc the scent may not be as strong or last as long but for what I get them and use them for there is no other product out there that could beat them! I get each refill to last almost a month in my bathroom by changing the setting on the plug in that you put the refill into....I would recommend these for others for sure and I buy it regularly myself. If you get it on subscribe and save you save money and time and dont need to worry about running out!",

Of course, it's not as easy to forget about if the scent doesn't last too long. I find that even at the lowest setting, I'm not getting the advertised 60 days. I get that it says up to 60 days, but as a consumer, I'm expecting 60 days when that's written. It's more like 45 days max. And depending on how open your home is, one of these could potentially be used for two rooms (e.g., dinning room and an adjacent room). I have three of these going at the same time that provides great scent for all of the common areas (i.e., living room, dinning room, stairway, and family room).",

I'd certainly buy this product again.",
