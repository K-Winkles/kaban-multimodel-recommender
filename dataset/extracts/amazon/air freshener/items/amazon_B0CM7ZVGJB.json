It is orange and neroli scented, so it definitely brings the citrus scent to the front. It is a nice rich scent, not a boring single note but rather something with some personality. They fit in the regular Glade warmers just fine, and you can get quite a few for a great price. I\u2019m interested in trying the other scents in this line and will definitely be testing them once these run out.",

They last for several weeks before you need to replace them. This one smells citrusy, almost like a floral and orange combined. It\u2019s very pleasant.

However, for how many bottles you get for the price, it's a good deal. In fact, I don't even think you need to use the dispenser for this. You just need to open up the cap and place the bottle at the desired location and it would infuse that space with the fragrance.With this many bottles, I think they will last me a long time.",

                "reviewText": "I like the Glade Aromatherapy line of scents because they have unique scent combinations and without a strong artificial chemical undertone. I was getting sick of spring mist and clean laundry.These work with the Glade plug-in device, so you need one of those. They last a few weeks and put out a noticeable and consistent amount of fragrance throughout that time. This particular scent is very heavy on orange, which I find refreshing and pleasant. I will get this scent again.",

Mine are from back when they had the little seashell logo on the front of the refill bulb.The fragrance is very Neroli forward with the citrus notes in the background. If you like Tom Ford Neroli Portofino, you might like this scent. It doesn't have the bergamot notes but I do think it shares a lot of the same notes.",
