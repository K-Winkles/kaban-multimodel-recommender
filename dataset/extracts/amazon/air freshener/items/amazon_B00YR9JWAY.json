The Lavender and Chamomile scent is lovely and not overpowering, but still powerful enough to freshen up a small room. The 5ct pack is a great value and lasts for a long time.One important thing to note, however, is that these scented oils can be toxic to cats. If you have cats in your home, it's best to avoid using these products or to keep them away from areas where your cats spend time. Overall, I highly recommend this Air Wick Plug in Scented Oil Refill for anyone looking for a reliable and effective air freshener.",

                "reviewText": "You don't need the plug in apparatus for this. I carry with me to hotels when I travel and sprinkle around the room. I sprinkle around my home after cleaning, even on the carpet and the furniture. It DOES NOT STAIN folks. It fades away and the it is highly concentrated which leaves your home smelling absolutely amazing for days and days and days. Sprinkle in your vehicle, on your draperies, wherever there is fabric. And when you walk into your bedroom or home you will be amazed at how wonderful it smells. The plug in part to me wares out quickly and is only concentrated mostly to the area that it is plugged in around. I like the entire home or living space to have that scent and my hack delivers. Give it a try!",
