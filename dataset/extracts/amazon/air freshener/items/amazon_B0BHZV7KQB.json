                "reviewText": "I bought 2 packs and 1 pack was perfect. It had every refill full of scent and the scent was amazing! The second pack however was weird. The refill bottles were only half full but 2 were about a quarter full and the scent was nothing like what I expected. The scent was floral and musky. Nothing like described. The color of the scented juice was also different. The first pack was almost caramel color and the second was clear color. I ordered both packs at the same time so it's just weird.",
