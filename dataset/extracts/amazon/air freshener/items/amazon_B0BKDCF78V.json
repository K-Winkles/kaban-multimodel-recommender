It has a very wet, warm, and unclean scent that just makes me feel like something is off. Unfortunately, I will be tossing these out. I personally don't think anyone would like to make their rooms or cars small like thisI can recommend Glade's current pine and cedar spray, that is very clean smelling and enjoyable",

The scent smells very nice, but it's pretty strong, so if you are sensitive to smells, this may be too intense. You only need to spray a small amount, especially for a bathroom, and the sprayer is easy to operate. The smell lasts a decent amount of time, but it does start fading after a bit. Each bottle lasts a very long time, so I should be set for quite a while. Overall, these are good room fresheners and are good for any room of the house.",
