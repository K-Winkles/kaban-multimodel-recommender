It seems like there are a few different sense to choose from, I didn\u2019t like the fragrance that came with this one but I did purchase the one that smells like coconut which I like a lot better it smells really nice.Oh I think this is great if you want to keep freshener going in your room and there is a little button to set it to spray more often or not. Wow I ended up turning mine off because it doesn\u2019t matter what room I put this damn thing in, it always seem to scare the shit out of me!! It\u2019s like an unexpected hiss because you\u2019re actually forget it\u2019s there, even in another room I can hear it and for a split second forgot what it was and thinking something strange is in my house!! I\u2019m not going to return this because maybe I\u2019ll eventually use it, but I think for now I\u2019m going to stick with a can of regular old fashion room spray that I manually use or just get one of the plug-in air fresheners, what the heck.",
