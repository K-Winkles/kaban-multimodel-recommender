All u need is 2 sprays and boom the smell is gone.The only thing I recommend is to not have it in ur purse with out a ziplock. I used it a couple of times and then somehow the bottle opened up and I loss 80% of the bottle and later on the bag. The scent took over my purse. So if u carry it around with keep it in a waterproof bag.",
