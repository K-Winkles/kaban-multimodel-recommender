If the beads continue to work effectively for 60-90 days, as advertised, I can live with it even if the \"Fresh Linen\" scent is gone. The scent is only detectable if I put my nose to the jar. But that is not how it should work.I hope I am not being unfair to this product, especially if a small company is involved. Unfortunately, we are asked to review a product almost the moment we receive it. If I am missing something, I would appreciate hearing from someone else who has purchased this item and has a different experience with it.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a couple of boxes of these Odor Eliminator Gel Beads, hoping to tackle some persistent odors in my home. Unfortunately, the results were far from satisfactory.Despite following the instructions diligently, the gel beads did not seem to make any significant difference in clearing up the unpleasant smells. I had high hopes for this product, but it simply didn't deliver on its promise.To make matters worse, when I decided to return the boxes, I encountered an issue. The top paper cover on one of the boxes was missing, making the return process more complicated. It's frustrating when a product not only fails to live up to expectations but also presents challenges when attempting to seek a refund.I'm disappointed with my experience and would caution others considering these Odor Eliminator Gel Beads to think twice before making a purchase. The missing cover added an extra layer of inconvenience, making this overall a regrettable buy for me.",
