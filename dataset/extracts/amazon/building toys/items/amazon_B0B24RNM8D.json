I always check out toys before gifting - mostly for safety's sake, and so I opened these to check them out. They're pretty cool. They snap together and pull apart pretty easily without being too loose. They are kinda small (not for the little kids), and are very colorful. I think a fun little set for kids over 4. I had fun with them... kinda sad to see 'em go.",
