The instructions for this mech was well documented. The one thing that threw me off early was the none numbered bags which I was used to with legos. My recommendations for anyone building these rhe first time is to sort the piece out first then start building. Note there are no extra pieces with these packs it's all or nothing. Every piece in the package is used. My one complaint was for some of the interlocks for 3 key areas which ads support which were a bit flimsy and I may make my own adjustments to make it more stable but aside from that this was a great kit and I will seek out the other sets from this mech collection.",

One potential issue is that there are no extra pieces included in the set, but as long as you don't lose any parts, it should not be a problem.Overall I think that this is an excellent model, even if can be difficult to assemble at times, due to the small parts and complex design.",

                "reviewText": "I've had +/- experiences with Nifeliz. On one hand, many of their products, including this one, have a good visual appeal, but on other hand, you may be missing pieces. As near as I can tell, I am missing maybe one piece from this particular set. It was more for decoration than any actual structural importance though. From the outset, the pieces come in several sealed bags, but they aren't split into major building parts like one would see with a more traditional LEGO set. This by itself is no big deal, I would recommend to have a decently sized area to spread and organize pieces though. I really liked the design and while the build is a bit tedious you are left with a pretty good looking product. But due to the design, not the bricks themselves, some parts may fall apart or just not hold together well secondary to weight or poor design (or both). I think this could be overcome with some small tweaks though so again not necessarily a big deal unless you want this for more than a show piece. Mine is in a display cabinet so maybe I'll fix some of the more structural issues (e.g. the feet tend to come a part with slight jostling). Overall I'm happy with what I've got and I think the price was reasonable. Though you could probably find it cheaper on Aliexpress if you don't mind waiting longer for it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Really wish there was something like this when I was a kid cuz this is probably the most sickest mech \u201clego\u201dPose-ability is very flexible, only cons:- No numbered bags - basically have to open all of them, sort by color then find each piece per step\u2026 If this was numbered, could easily finish this in maybe under 1 hour or so- Some weak articulations point, weak connections - Most obvious that comes to mind is the articulation of the arms, specifically the part that allows flexion/extension (google if you want to know what i mean). It\u2019s secured only by 2x 1x1 bricks. Another example is the back part of the cannon (or howitzer per the booklet), its white cylinder piece, its only connection is a circle 1x1 (or maybe it\u2019s 0.5x1) brick, comes off easily. Would definitely need to reinforce these weak points with some kind of adhesive.- Brick quality - the bricks could definitely use some quality control, one example is the brick that connects to a ball, there\u2019s like left over plastic (i\u2019ll add photos later)Overall, I really like it and would definitely buy the other mechs but these issues really prevent it from being a full 5 star in my book",

The instructions were detailed and came with side information about the lore behind the build, which I thought was neat. The pieces you get are final, so if you lose some wamp wamp, but I believe they're 1:1 to official legos, so you could probably replace them. Building the mech was fun and I was able to do it in a night, unfortunately as the other reviews state, no numbered bags for building order. Me personally I separated the colors in their own piles. Yadda yadda, pose-ability is really fun but a little funky. Some joints are a lil loose but tweak around and it'll be perfect. Also the value is amazing, 36ish dollars after shipping to what should be a 50ish(maybe) dollar set is awesome.",

The line shows great promise but needs refinement, maybe using more clips and bars for added friction in the joints, or else downsizing the designs. The final piece looks good and has great presence on the shelf, but the sheer size/mass creates its own problems.I would have happily paid more for these designs with better brick quality and a few extra pieces of some of the more exotic bricks.Overall 6/10, looking forward to future mech designs from this team.",

                "reviewText": "Vorab: Die Bewertung bezieht sich auf den Bausatz f\u00fcr den Blue Brinoac bzw. Brino AC (oder einfach gesagt: der mit gro\u00dfem Schild und Gewehr)Das Set hat insgesamt einen ganz guten Eindruck gemacht. Die Verpackung war schlicht aber schick gestaltet, die Anleitung hochwertig gedruckt und beinhaltet au\u00dferdem ein paar kleine Details zum Designer und dem Mecha, was nett zu lesen war und sch\u00f6n auf den Bau eingestimmt hat. Das erste Manko f\u00e4llt dann aber auf, wenn man die Box \u00f6ffnet und die T\u00fcten herausnimmt. Diese sind n\u00e4mlich leider nicht beschriftet, was den Zusammenbau etwas in die L\u00e4nge zieht. Ich w\u00fcrde empfehlen die Steine am Anfang der Farbe nach zu sortieren, so habe ich mir beim 2. Mecha einiges an Zeit gespart. Speziell mit diesem Mecha hatte ich auch bei der Anleitung Probleme die blauen und grauen Steine zu unterscheiden und musste \u00f6fters mit Handy-Taschenlampe genauer leuchten um die Farben unterscheiden zu k\u00f6nnen. Auch wenn ich vorsichtig war, habe ich am Ende doch 2-3 Steine gehabt die farblich nicht zu der Anleitung gepasst haben. Das hat dem Endprodukt aber keinen Abbruch getan. Schade find ich eher dass der Mecha, fertig zusammengebaut, sehr fragile ist. Ich wei\u00df nat\u00fcrlich nicht ob das immer so ist, aber die Gelenke sind etwas zu leichtg\u00e4ngig was einige Positionierungen schwierig gestaltet. Nichtsdestotrotz sieht der fertig gebaute Mecha wirklich cool aus und l\u00e4sst sich mit etwas Feingef\u00fchl dennoch sch\u00f6n in Pose bringen. F\u00fcr das Problem bei der Stabilit\u00e4t ziehe ich einen Stern ab, die anderen Kritikpunkte gewichte ich jedoch nicht so stark, sodass insgesamt ein guter Gesamteindruck bleibt, sofern man die kleinen Abstriche brim Komfort im Vergleich zum gro\u00dfen Konkurrenten verkraften kann.",
