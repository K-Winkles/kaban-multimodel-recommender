                "reviewText": "Got this for our 5yo autistic spectrum ADHD son who loves Legos and anything involving manipulation of parts of a whole or whatever. He enjoys figuring this out. It requires more than just sticking Legos together. It involves twisting and trial/error, critical mechanical thinking. I also like that it's wood, not plastic. I also appreciate that this is a \"genuine\" M&D brand product, you can be relatively reassured for material safety and quality. I've had no issues. I do with the wood was more \"finished\" or glazed to aid in cleaning but other than that it's fine and seems like it'll hold up for his younger sisters. It's also fun to watch two or more of them fiddle with all the bits, snatching the finished pieces from brother, tantrums over nonsense. But yes, if your kid loves putting stuff together or likes identifiable categories of numerical stuff then s/he will probably find some use out of this at least.",
