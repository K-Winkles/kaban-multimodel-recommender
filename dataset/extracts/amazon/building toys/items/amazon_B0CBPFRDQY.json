                "reviewText": "Received this item and right away it is SMALL...there's a 2lt in my photo for reference on size..that's fine as it's cute...but the pieces are very small and difficult to put together. This seems more appropriate for adults and teens...not kids per say. The main issue is from the beginning there pieces missing. Nothing that interrupted my building but very annoying. As I progressed to the second level there were finally main pieces missing that forced me to stop building. There was no way I or my husband could find a way to contact the company for replacement parts so my only option was to return/exchange to Amazon. So I broke down my original build and waited for my new box. It came and was also missing pieces as I put it together. Luckily (thanks to hubby) I had yet to return the original so between the two I finished it completely and returned the original box. Be prepared to do the same if you want this set.",

                "reviewText": "I had a lot of fun building this Coffee Shop model. No missing parts, as a matter of fact I had quite a few leftover pieces (did I miss something? I don\u2019t think so). I wouldn\u2019t recommend this for a beginner as there are many parts and reading the instructions can be challenging at times (no words just pictures). I\u2019ve built cars and motorcycles with similar kits, this was my first building. And yes I\u2019ve ordered another! For me this is like a 3D jigsaw puzzle.I think the instructions are excellent, pieces fit together correctly, all steps done in a logical order (from the floor up) and the final product is something I\u2019m proud of. There are many inside items: tables and chairs, service counter top, cash register, record player, coffee mugs, donuts, plants inside and out, even an air conditioner!I spent 10-12 hours working on it. The last part of the roof is a bit unsteady in my opinion but that is the only negative I can think of. The string of tiny lights (with an on/off switch) adds a warm glow. If this was a real place I\u2019d go in it for sure! \ud83d\ude00",

So the above was for the first set that I did. I liked it enough to order another one. On that one I am missing at least 1 (maybe 2) bags of pieces for the 3rd section - and the base plates at that, so I can't even start it. I just ordered a replacement set from Amazon; hopefully with that I'll be able to complete the build and return an incomplete set.",

Overall, I had fun putting it together, but the flowers were so hard to understand were each went. For my first Lego assembly I think I did pretty good and is fun to look at. The only thing I recommend to the company is have instruction in better color so people who wear glasses can tell the difference in the colors. Recommend to kids 10 and up... Have plenty of Light when working.",
