                "reviewText": "I would like to start by saying thank you for the thank you card! My son and I love the toy and my son still plays with it all the time! He just got introduced to Transformers which revived his interest in the toy since it can be changed from one truck to another. Seeing as how this is one of the most played with toys my son has ever had, and since I've never received a thank you card from a small business before, I feel it is only necessary for me to give you a very sincere and honest review. I hope that my criticism helps you to learn and grow as a company and I wish the best for you! I'll start with the positives.Pros: The overall concept of this toy is absolutely wonderful! It is the perfect difficultly level for my son who just turned 4! It is not too difficult to where he gets extremely frustrated, but it also has enough parts that it keeps him thinking. Some parts have to be put together in a specific order which is great for his motor skills and understanding, but it also blew his mind when I turned the crane around and called it a tow-truck! (He loves tow-trucks too!) He loves to use his imagination and pretend that something is wrong with the truck and that he is the mechanic for the job! I also love that it is very interactive! My son loves his Dada and always wants to help with all my projects that are much more dangerous and some are even too dangerous for me to allow him to help, so this is the perfect opportunity to reverse rolls. He enjoys being in charge and deciding who gets specific jobs and it is a great toy for bonding! Unfortunately, I do have a couple cons though and they both have to do with the motor/controller functions.Cons: I really like that you can remove the motor and transfer it to the controller to use as a drill and my son loves it as well, but it was pretty disappointing when used as the motor in the truck for a couple reasons. The first is lack of power. It doesn't necessarily need to go extremely fast, but it can't even get over the tiniest bumps which really limits the travel range. In addition to that, the switch on the motor can only face down so when you do attempt to go over a bump, guess what happens? Yup, it flips the switch! My last issue with this is that it doesn't turn, which again, limits the abilities of what you can do with this toy. It was so sad because my son would get so excited about the truck when he would put it together and have it all ready to go, and then you would see his excitement slowly fade away once he tries to control it to go somewhere...Well there it is. My overall opinion is that it is an amazing toy and concept, but I feel that it could be so much more if it had more capabilities as a remote control. That alone was the only reason I didn't purchase one of the other models. Maybe even make more advanced levels that have controls to dump the truck or operate the crane! My son is very curious when it comes to moving equipment, and if it can move, he wants to move it! I hope that this was a helpful review and I thank you again for the incredible toy. I would absolutely will, and have recommended it to more than a few friends.",
