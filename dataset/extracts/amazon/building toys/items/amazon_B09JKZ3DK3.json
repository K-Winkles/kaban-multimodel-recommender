                "reviewText": "If you are a John Deere fan and a Lego fan, this is the perfect set for you. The scale for the tractor feels right. If you are just a Lego fan looking for another set, then this might be a pass? It only has two functions, the steering and the dump on the trailer. The turn radius of the steering is limited, and there are several large stickers that can be tricky to put on straight. It does seem to be a pretty robust build holding up to my two year old playing with it (with supervision). The biggest appeal is that there is finally a John Deere Licensed Lego set.",
