                "reviewText": "This was quite disappointing especially on Christmas morning. When this was purchased it looked as if it would be a complete set that a child could build and enjoy, unfortunately it doesn't even come with enough blocks to fully build anything that is even displayed in the booklet it comes with. You can't even build the image displayed on the box itself which is what's advertised. My son was extremely disappointed when he realized he didn't have enough to build the images in the booklet. I am only giving two stars because the blocks quality themselves is decent",
