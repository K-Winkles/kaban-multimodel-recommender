Seriously I thought about sending them back when my months old child didn\u2019t show interest in playing with them immediately. Then figured I would give it more time. so glad I did. The kids will grow more and more interested and intrigued but they limits of imagination with them. ever shown Every block is made perfect.I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, quality is what it\u2019s all about. Look the blocks aren\u2019t going to stack right if they weren\u2019t made right.Long story ahead: I actually had to adjust the legs of his play table after noticing his frustration due to the imbalance. He balances them on everything. Obsessed. He is just turning 3 and I watched him self learn what a shim is. He grabbed my Apple Watch to lift the block so he could enclose an open shelf with them. The things absolutely impressed me.",

                "reviewText": "After a few months of my 3 year old playing with these, I'm going to give this 4 stars.The biggest reason is they are pretty small. It's a LOT of blocks, but it's a lot of small blocks, which are difficult if not impossible to build with on our fluffy shaggy carpeting. It's not the end of the world, which is why I still am giving it 4 stars, but it can be frustrating for him. Which means it's frustrating for me. We just give him a big book to use as a base and that's alright, but I'd caution against buying this for a very young child who still puts things in their mouth or who gets frustrated easily...The box they come in is not really great for storage, so be prepared to transfer them to another bin if these get played with regularly. It just doesn't hold up.Other than being small and the not-good-for-long box, my son loves these blocks. He pretends they are food and pretends to cook them, he plants \"gardens\" full of blocks, and of course builds pretty great buildings. The colors are bright and slightly glossy, and the paint is holding up very well so far, but if your kid is still chewing on their toys I don't think the paint would last long. They are also uniform in size and fit together nicely without gaps. There are no warped pieces or wonky pieces that might make a builder frustrated.Also, someone mentioned something about a prop 65 warning... check out the list of chemicals online at OEHHA.ca.gov before you get too worked up. There are some pretty bizarre rules about what gets a warning (only one agency has to deem it dangerous; there's no checks/balances. It also doesn't take into account different states of the chemical; somethings are only hazardous when inhaled as an aerosol, but if it's dry paint they still might list it on the package. It's also entirely up to businesses to use their discretion in adding a prop 65 warning, so sometimes I imagine it's a \"better safe than sorry\" scenario). It might be as simple as the plastic handle attached to the box contains pthalates. Or that there could be wood dust in the box (true story, wood dust is on the list for causing cancer). In which case, a warning would need to be issued. On the Melissa and Doug website they have a whole page about safety and their testing requirements, especially regarding paint.Anyway. These are a very nice, quality made children's toy and the only reason I don' t despise picking up all 100 of them daily is that my son loves them.",
