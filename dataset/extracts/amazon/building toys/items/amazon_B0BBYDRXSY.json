                "reviewText": "Honestly there's not much to say about this set. It's Lego so we already know that it's pretty high quality. The main issue i think is that for what you get I think that it's a bit expensive. Lego has been climbing up in price the last while but quality and things of that nature have not changed at all. What used to be a staple produce for kids to do creative things with has almost become a luxury item I feel. Yes it could be argued that all things increase with time but it's a pretty small set for a rather expensive price tag. Regardless my nephew loves it and that's what counts and I'm sure that he will get alot of re-use out of it for years to come.",
