                "reviewText": "Great toy for my 5 year old, he loves to play with them and build his ideas. The directions need help, if the plan is to build an example project. The quality is okay, we have had a few not stay together and I have had to glue a few. This toy does not get played with regularly and my son is very light on his toys. I would not suspect these toys to last if they were used regularly or with a child who is rough on toys., They are somewhat cheap plastic. Still fun to play with, great way to give the child ideas to build.",

All the kids that come over love it, and I\u2019ve already bought a few to give as birthday gifts. One of the parties was today and the kids all started playing with it immediatelyz. Some of the parents are going up buy it for their own children. Great quality, enough pieces and wheels, but all in a nice little case to bring anywhere. It comes camping with us, or anywhere to help entertain our son. My son is mostly amused by connecting type of toys or ones that involve vehicles, so this was a great buy! Will keep buying.",

So I ordered another set and he\u2019s thrilled at what he can make!5 stars and worth every penny!The odd piece has broken because too much pressure used but I still give it 5 stars",
