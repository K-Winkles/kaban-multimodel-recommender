                "reviewText": "Okay I was worried about buying these because there were mixed reviews on the size of the blocks being okay for littles. I realllly wanted neutral blocks though, so I decided to just purchase and see. Firstly, they are SO cute. They are super good quality, and I even love the dust bag that it comes with. Second, I truly don\u2019t see how a block could choke a baby. They ARENT tiny. There is no way a child could swallow them. They aren\u2019t as big as the pictures make them look, but nothing to worry about. They are great for my one year old and two year old (and safety is a big deal to me, so I don\u2019t say that lightly!)",

The photo on Amazon is extremely misleading - that child must be a dwarf (or a tiny person is more PC). Yes, I know they provided measurements of the blocks in their information but they were for my granddaughter who lives 3 hours away. Did they really want me to go measure the existing blocks as a comparison? I did look at the sizing, but I only measured one of the large blocks (which happened to be the first one on the list and given the photo, it looked like they were all similarly sized). I would have returned them but by the blocks are well done with nice paint colors and some interesting shapes. Granddaughter thinks they are ok, but we want to make a really big tower and these are like building in miniature. I wouldn\u2019t recommend for toddlers.",
