The colors are beautiful and vibrant, and the cute bugs add a fun touch. There are so many different ways to put the track and flowers together making it exciting each time it\u2019s pulled out. It definitely has some small choking hazard parts if you have babies in your home but my 5 year old loves it. Just wish it wasn\u2019t so brittle.",

I would just caution buyers that the leaves do snap off easily if stepped on or caught on carpet when sweeping them into a pile for cleanup. This doesn't bother us, but we do stay on top of any broken pieces to avoid choking hazard.",
