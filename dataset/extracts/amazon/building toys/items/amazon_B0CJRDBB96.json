                "reviewText": "I was actually looking for regular wooden blocks for my little one, when I came across these. My little one is still pretty young & her muscle development is just beginning to become somewhat coordinated. These blocks are about one inch square & are the perfect size for little hands. While her coordination is still clumsy, she can experience success in stacking the blocks because they will stick together since they're magnetic.I do like that they are square, rather than other shapes like triangles, varied shapes or building pieces that are long & narrow. She'll be able to manage wooden block, Duplo blocks & bristle blocks when she's a little older.These blocks are also attractive. There are six each of pink, yellow, green, blue & purple. The colors are attractive & are definitely of interest to little ones. Having 30 blocks is a fairly generous number & allows for building things that are somewhat substantial. It also allows for others to interact with little ones & demonstrate stacking & building. When my little one gets a bit older, I may get her another set so that she can build more elaborate items.Another thing I like about this set is that the manufacturers included a little booklet with suggested things to build with the existing blocks. There is a diagram that can be copied of several things, like a dog, giraffe, flower & house. I think it was a good idea to include the diagrams of things children can make, so that they have ideas of what to build beyond houses & skyscrapers. Also, the magnets in the blocks allow children to build things that aren't possible with regular blocks, like bridges with elevated road decks.I'd recommend these to others & expect I'll order additional sets for future use.",

                "reviewText": "Admittedly, these blocks are a bit smaller than I expected--about 1.25\"--but that is not necessarily a BAD thing. It allows for little hands to grasp and play with them easily! There's virtually no limit to what you can build with these fun magnetic building blocks!I like that they come in a nice box which can be used to store them in or, since they are magnetic, you don't really even need to store them inside a box! Either way, they take up very little space in your home, unlike larger traditional building blocks. The pastel colors are also nice. It comes with a booklet filled with different ideas, but I think you'll be surprised at what your kids can create with these! I know I had fun playing with them!I highly recommend these -- maybe even pick up an extra box to build more elaborate things! The only thing I wish is that they were not quite as pricey as they were in January 2024 ($24.99). I think $19.99 would be a more reasonable price for this 30-block set.IMPORTANT NOTE: If any toy contains small items or magnets, it does cause me concern. If your child swallows a magnet, you should immediately take them to the hospital since this is a very dangerous situation. The manufacturer has placed a warning on the exterior of the packaging stating that and recommends these for ages 3 years of age and up.",

They are compact and would occupy your toddler for hours. Since they are magnetic, they wouldn't get lost or scatter as they clump together.I found the manufacturer's description confusing. On the one hand, they say they are suitable for 1-3 years old and they can't be swallowed. I bought these for my friend's daughter and she is almost 2. The box came with a warning label about swallowing magnets and death.That being said, the blocks are great for tiny hands to manipulate and stick together for ease of stacking because of the magnets. The blocks come with a booklet of model ideas that range in the difficulty of assessment. This is a great way to exercise young minds' cognitive development.I would highly recommend supervising your toddler when using these blocks!",

                "reviewText": "I love the pastel colors. The magnets in the blocks work well. Before buying these, I wasn't sure how magnetic blocks work and wondered if you would be limited at all in how you could connect them (since with typical magnets, one side would stick and the other side would repel). But no, the magnets can be connected to one another on any side.The magnets adhere pretty well for stationary use. If you make a tower and bump it, shake it, or pick it up, some of the blocks might fall off. But the flip side of this is that it's easy to separate the blocks when the child wants to, which will help avoid frustration. And it helps make sure kids' skin won't get pinched between the magnets.The box they come in is really convenient for storing them even after they're opened. And it looks nice, so could definitely be giftable.Also, I appreciate that the instruction booklet reminds parents of the importance of making sure kids don't swallow the magnets if the blocks were to get broken in any way. They seem sturdy enough to hold up to normal play, but as we all know, kids can have a knack for breaking things... and magnets are something you REALLY don't want your kid to swallow, so I think it's good to give that reminder.",

                "reviewText": "We actually have these blocks in primary colors, i.e. a set of red, yellow, green, and blue. It seems like all of these styles of magnetic blocks are in a similar price range and come with the same amount of blocks, which is basically enough to build one small house, but not much else! So I got additional sets in primary colors, and one more set in this pastel. (Yes, that means a total investment of around $60-90 to have about a hundred blocks!) This is one of the sets I saw in pastel colors, and even though they are a different brand, they integrate with our current sets well. Sturdy, and good for creative building.",
