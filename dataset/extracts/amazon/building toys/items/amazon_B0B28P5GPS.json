Instructions are a little tricky for younger children to work on alone. And the pieces sometimes looked different than what was being shown on the booklet.Overall he had fun, but he did give up a few times. This is better suited for an older child",

The only inconvenient is that their instructions are hard to read because of their small size.However, costumer service was great. First, they sent me the full letter size, manual of instructions and then they resend me the manual with the activities in order from the easiest to the hardest. For your convenience, this is the order they sent me: 5th, 6th, 4th, 9th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th, 10th (these are the position of the machine in the instructions).It is a learning process, so I helped my grandson to build a few, not necesarily in the order above.",

                "reviewText": "Got this for my son, who loves to wield a screwdriver and twist nuts and bolts with the earnest enthusiasm of an underage unpaid 5-year old laborer.The assembly aspect is great: The many projects are fun to build; they\u2019re sturdy and functional when done, the pieces fit together properly, and once built, he has a lot of fun rearranging parts to suit his imagination.The major problem is that the instructions are impossible for a kid to follow, and were very difficult for ME to follow. There is a lot of guesswork involved. They are in image format, and they are tiny. Also, the images are very poorly angled in their presentation - meaning that the part where you are supposed to insert a screw, bend a plastic piece, or whatever, may well be hidden from view - you\u2019ll see the front of a 3D image with an arrow pointing somewhere behind the surface layer. So I have to sit with my son and guide him through the steps, and occasionally, frustratingly back-track a few steps with \u201cOops, Mommy made a mistake, this piece actually goes into the 5th hole, not the 3rd, I just had to guess because the picture didn\u2019t show us\u2026.\u201dHe certainly doesn\u2019t mind making the revisions, but there\u2019s a limit to how much patience the adult has\u2026",
