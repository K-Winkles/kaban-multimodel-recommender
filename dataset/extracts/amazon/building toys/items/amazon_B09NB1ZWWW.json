These are more affordable than other options, but I think you have to buy two of them to really make something grand. There aren't enough square pieces and too many triangle pieces. I bought another set of 60 and that seems like a good amount.Update. After several weeks of play, some of the pieces are breaking apart and the magnets are coming out. I'll still leave it at 5 stars because they're cheaper than comparable brands and they held up fairly well after heavy use.",
