Her cousin who is almost 4 came over and they both enjoyed playing with it together. There are endless ways in which to assemble the tree/flowers. I also thought it's really cute with the added forest creatures and bugs instead of just flowers like some other similar products you can find like this. The storing/carrying case exceeded my expectation...I love toys that can be contained in their own space and this cute little container did just that. It's size was also perfect because it's spacious enough that all the pieces easily fit in (can't stand it when you are trying to fit toys into a container they just barely fit in have to put them in just so). The pieces snap together well, you do have to put some force behind putting them together, but my almost 3 year old was able to figure it out so I don't think that's a negative and if anything ensures the pieces stay put to where they are placed. Overall, I'm really pleased (and I think my daughter is too)...would recommend! :)My Star Rating Rubric:5 \u2b50\ufe0f - Perfect! Love it! Product exceeded my expectations.4 \u2b50\ufe0f - Great! Like it. Nothing wrong with it - met my expectations.3 \u2b50\ufe0f - Okay-ish. Not quite what I expected/hoped it to be. Some issues with product.2 \u2b50\ufe0f - Not ok. A product I will not re-order or recommend to others. Major deficits.1 \u2b50\ufe0f - \u201cIs this a joke?\u201d Product dysfunctional. I will not be using/will be returning product.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, I really wish the first product photo would reflect an accurate size of this item. The current photo makes this look huge (in comparison to the little girl), and it is not like that in real life. That said, this is a really fun and cute set. It comes with a lot of pieces to make a big tree with ground pieces, little creatures, leaves, flowers, branches, etc. I love that it comes with a storage box. I get so tired of opening sets with lots of pieces, and then I have to buy a storage box or use a Ziploc bag to store everything. The storage box also has a handle, which is nice. My kids were super excited when I gave them this, and they immediately started using it. They have a set that is similar in concept, but you only build flowers. They love that too, but this has a lot more elements to it. I think this would make a great gift. This really inspires creative play, and it's something that most kids will want to play with over and over. It all seems well made.I look at reviews a lot when shopping. I hope this review helps.",

My toddler is pretty strong but she can't put in the pieces very well. It requires finessing, twisting and turning to actually assemble the tree. She gets a few in and then loses interest or will come ask me to do it... and then it sorta loses its fun for her cuz she can't do it \ud83e\udd72 Then it's just becomes her watching me play with the toy hahaha. Maybe a much older kid would be able to do it but idk if bigger kids would find this toy fun at their age \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
