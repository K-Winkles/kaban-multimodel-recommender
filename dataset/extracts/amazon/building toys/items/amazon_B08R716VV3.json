Not too sturdy so I taped up the whole thing once we finished before it breaks apart after. And will keep it this shape. Got for him for xmas gift as his school had one & he wanted one so much. My son did opened up the box first so maybe some pcs are missing somewhere in the house. Until we find those missing pcs, I think we did a great job. \ud83d\udc4d",

It feels kind of cheap.. the tiles are smaller than regular sized ones. So they can't fit with the previous magnetic tiles she has. Since they are smaller the magnet also feels not as strong either. So I would prefer to stay consistent with the size of the tiles which was my own fault for not checking tile size",
