                "reviewText": "I got this toy for my granddaughter who is 3 years 9 months old.The storage bucket is pretty good, with a screw-on lid so things inside will STAY inside. The handle on the lid had a tendency to come loose, but that's not a huge issue. There were plenty of \"flakes\" in the bucket, in a nice variety of colors.The flakes themselves are pretty solid. They are large enough that I think it would be \"difficult\" for a child to choke on one, but smaller children should still be supervised. The flakes fit together by connecting slots, and snap together firmly. Each flake has 8 slots positioned evenly around the edge (so \"north\", \"northeast\", \"east\", \"southeast\", \"south\", \"southwest\", \"west\", and \"northwest\"). The sizes aren't perfect - if you attach 8 flakes to a central one, then 8 more to an outer ring, they will overlap very slightly, but not enough to make an issue. All construction will use \"octagonal\" forms rather than \"hexagonal\" which is probably easier for kids to understand. It means that structures will naturally build right angles and straight lines.The paper instructions included excellent step-by-step directions for 3 structures, showing exactly how many pieces of each color were needed and how to fit them together. There were pictures of a dozen or so other structures that could be built, with several noting that you needed more than one \"bucket\" to make them in the colors shown. The instructions for those items were accessible by QR-code from the manufacturer website, so not ideal for kids but reasonable especially if you were to print them ahead of time.My grandkid (not quite 4 years old) is not quite up to the recommended 5-year point but was able to connect the flakes herself into a simple straight line and then disassemble it again, but didn't quite grasp the nuance of 2-dimensional building strategy. She's probably a little too young to really appreciate them but will grow into them over the next few months. Nonetheless, she was able to use them adequately. I look forward to many years of building in the future.",

The colours are very bright. Very young children could learn their colours from playing with this toy. Excellent quality and very sturdy and very well made too. When not in use, its stored in a large tub with a carrying handle. Great value for money.",
