The pictures are big enough and clear enough to see, as reg stacking cup numbers blend into the cup. He can count with them now and count the pictures that go with the numbers and we do colors and language skills finding pictures....it's just great. The stacking itself is more tough because it's harder to get the stacking down unlike the stacking cups that he can do in seconds....these are just boxes so they can slide off easier so it helps him take more time and think more and plus they are boxes....what kid doesn't have more fun with boxes! We play tossing games with them, hiding toys under them....the size of the tower is so great! I wish I had found these when my teenagers were little. My 23month old loves these....and they don't get lost like the stacking cups do all the time because they are so small. Only complaint is that I wish they were little bit stronger because of course kids step on toys so one box did bend a bit but thankfully is still usable and we have taught him not to do so lol",
