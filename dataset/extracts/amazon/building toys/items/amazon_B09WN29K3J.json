It definitely takes another person to hold the pieces together while the screws are put in. We painted the finished projects with acrylics and then added the decals. The boys were incredibly proud of their finished projects, and want to do another one. It was a great way to introduce them to following directions in a different way from Legos. The directions were quite good and easy to follow. Highly recommended.",

Some were fine, some were pretty junky, but this set of four projects stood head and shoulders above the rest. The kits are beautifully designed and the materials, mostly solid wood, are carefully cut, drilled and finished. I was struck by the countersinking for the screw heads (also making piece identification easier) and the rounded corners of the various pieces. Overall quality and thoughtful details (the helicopter kit includes a Lego-like pilot) make this an outstanding bargain and a pleasure to work with and to share with my grandchildren. (The tow truck was so beautifully made we couldn\u2019t bear to use the included decals, as neat as they were.)",
