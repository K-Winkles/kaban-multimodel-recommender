                "reviewText": "I know people hate the comparison to Lego, but if we're talking price per piece, they are on par with the pricing of this set. And that's not really a good thing. I always thought Mega Blocks were cool, they had better themes like Pokemon and Halo, and now you're telling me I can get a brick built Godzilla? Count me in. I just wish the pricing was a little cheaper, Lego has gotten incredibly expensive and they are starting to lack a good solid theme/franchise. They haven't picked up a new IP in a while, and they seem to stray away from anything militaristic or semi-violent. That's why I enjoy Mega Blocks. I was a huge fan of the Halo sets they put out, and loved the larger Pokemon builds. I am looking forward to the other Kaiju if they plan to make them. King Ghidorah would be awesome! If this set was just a couple dollars cheaper I would 100% recommend, but if you're not a huge fan of the Godzilla franchise, I'd wait for a larger discount during a sale or something.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars I have mixed feelings about this Godzilla set\u2026",
                "reviewText": "As both a long-time Godzilla fan and long-time Mega Bloks\u2026uh, long-time Mega Construx\u2026uh, long-time Mega (Mattel, all that money you spent on rebranding probably should have gone into improving your domestic and worldwide distribution\u2026just sayin\u2019) fan, I must admit that I have conflicting feelings about this set. On one hand, I am thrilled to see Mega license another IP that I love (adding to Halo and [sniff] Call of Duty). On the other, they could have done so much more than they did with this first set in the line.On the plus side, as usual for Mega, both the box and manual look fantastic and the instructions are very easy to follow. The parts bags are numbered 1 through 10, each bag only contains the parts needed for that particular step in the build, and there were no missing pieces. The build itself is structurally very sound and offers tons of playability and poseability. The blue atomic breath is rendered well and the small bit of scenery with the building that can be toppled over is a nice touch.All that being said, Godzilla himself is a bit of a disappointment. To start with, Godzilla is not a \u201csmooth\u201d creature. Aside from the pink ridge on his back, this Godzilla has very little exterior detail. There should be many more small bloks on his skin that give him a more Godzilla-like texture. I know this may have resulted in a higher price for the set, but I for one would have been willing to pay more for better detail.And that poseability I praised earlier came at a heavy cost. There is so much open space in front of and behind the hip section that when viewed from the side, the build looks incomplete. They should have found a way to hood the ball joints at the hip as was done for the head and tail. At least Mega was honest and put a silhouette of the side view right on the front cover of the box.And the feet, while allowing the build to stand securely, are visually a complete failure. They look like elephant feet!...what happened to the front of Godzilla\u2019s feet?While the graphics are all pad printed (no stickers!), the look of Godzilla\u2019s head is another miss. Couldn\u2019t the brows have been raised just a little to give him a look of aggression or anger? With the expressionless eyes and wrinkled face, he appears more like an old man throwing up blueberry cobbler than a rampaging monster.In the end, I can still recommend this build to other diehard Godzilla and Mega fans\u2026 but just barely. Before you pull the trigger, however, take a look at the other third party Godzilla builds out there. If you are only going to get one, there are options available that may better fit your idea of what a Godzilla set should be. Mega, I know you can and should do better.",

It took me only a few hours to build and I enjoyed every second. I think the scale is perfect and the details look great. The manual was big which I like cause your can see the pieces clearly. I have had manuals to some that are small making me have to squint to see them. Mega brand is a great brand. They are always putting out unique builds that Lego\u2019s don\u2019t offer. Their pieces are just as good quality and they are compatible with Lego\u2019s as well. I have both the Kong and Godzilla builds displayed together.

Lego of course is the gold standard but MEGA has some heavy hitters in themes and popular character builds themselves. This is one of them: trendy Godzilla. Of course it delighted my son and now he wants the Kong set. This set was fun to build and play with, Godzilla has a good range of motion and playability and he just looks so cool on display. Instructions were clear and easy to follow with picture by picture steps. Blocks are good quality and snap together tightly which makes the build feel sturdy. I only took the star away because the price of $50 (at the time of this review) seems a bit high. Great gift for that big lizard fan!",
