This was the easiest track to put together - snaps on, snaps off, and there\u2019s no right or wrong way to set it up. The track is incredibly durable, and really fun to tinker with to create bumps, twists and turns. The two vehicles that come with it are FAST, and surprisingly, stay on the track! I feel like every other one I\u2019ve purchased in the past is a pain to put together, even more of a pain to put away, and the cars fall off it (and they are always way more expensive than this). FIVE STARS \u2b50\ufe0f! I will probably purchase another one just so we can make the track even bigger and have more fun!",

                "reviewText": "This product is super interesting and the reason I love it is also the reason it gets 4 stars. From a kids perspective, the track is inaccessible to kids without good fine motor function and strength (<4). The track pieces can be difficult to snap in, even for adults, and can be easily damaged if not done just right. That said, this track is great for its super strength locking mechanism with each track piece; it\u2019s similar to puzzle pieces in the way it snaps together. My 2.5 year old could definitely dismantle the track with enough force, but the beauty of this track is the track only becomes disconnected at one point, between 2 pieces. The other pieces don\u2019t start falling off with it, requiring you to rebuild the whole track like with a standard block track. This minimizes frustration when rebuilding and also helps build confidence with easy problem solving. The cars that come with it are GOGOGO over all terrain, carpet doesn\u2019t stop them, they literally seem to crawl over things and will not stop. They are super entertaining on the track and are playing bumper cars the whole time which is fun to watch. The battery application is a nightmare and requires a teeny screwdriver. Overall, great for the price, has minimal flaws, very durable, and great for all ages even if some need more help than others.",

                "reviewText": "This was gifted to a two year old and our older kids had just as much fun playing with this toy. The different ways you can build the tracks and run the vehicles kept them entertained for a long time.I will say the one downside is the track can be a little tricky for younger kids to put together. And be cautious where the vehicles go, especially if the get off the track. The vehicles can get easily tangled into pets fur.",
