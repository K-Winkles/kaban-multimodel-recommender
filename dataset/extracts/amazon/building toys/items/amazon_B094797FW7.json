                "reviewText": "I like the concept of creating different kinds of construction vehicles with magnetic materials. The magnet system works well to connect the materials together. However, for quality, it is easy to make scratches on the plastic when you take sections off. Also, they are quite tricky to put together for young children. Even for me, it\u2019s not that easy. The product recommended age is 3+, but 3-year-old and 4-year-old do not have the muscle strength to put the construction vehicles together. We had friends with 3-5 years old children to come for play date, and we had to assemble the vehicles for children. The children enjoyed playing with them. Just need adults help put together or take apart all the time.",
