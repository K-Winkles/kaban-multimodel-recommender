They had so much fun building and taking these things apart and there were a lot of pieces so they weren't fighting with each other over them. But it was hard for them to put it together. The ridges are hard so when you try to fit the pieces together it's hard for a toddler to get them in they're not strong enough to do it themselves. I had to help them put a few of the pieces together because it was hard for them to put together. But other than that they absolutely loved it.",
