We had a waitress recommend these to us and it's been great! She's been playing with them for a few months and they are still fine. We had to get rid of a few smaller pieces she was actually able to nibble pieces from but most of them have been quite sturdy.The colors are bright, the size is perfect for smaller hands, and me and my husband enjoy stacking them with her. They, also, stick the sides of the tub when wet. Overall, great purchase!",
