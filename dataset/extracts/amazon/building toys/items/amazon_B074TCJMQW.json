We have enjoyed building many things together, including several of the models in the instruction book, which I found easy to follow. He has been able to use his own ideas to make original creations. As he gets older I anticipate he will be able to build things on his own, including some of the more advanced models given in the instruction book. There is a good range of difficulty from very easy to much more challenging, so I think this will provide entertainment for many years. I emailed the company to request some more of the little connecting pieces as we had a few ideas of extra things to build using them. They immediately replied and sent some more of those pieces at no extra cost. I highly recommend this product and this company!",
