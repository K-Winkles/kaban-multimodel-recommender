                "reviewText": "This toy is perfect for our soon-to-be 6-year-old twins. They\u2019ve just finally taken an interest in their other building blocks and magnetic tiles, so we thought this would be a great alternative. Great quality for the price, our twins have already found several creative ways to play with them, and the plastic carrying case is an added plus for clean-up.",

I was disappointed because the way they show what comes in the 170 pack mislead me into thinking we were getting twenty wheels, but it came with ten. And the smaller set also comes with ten so that was frustrating.",
