Anyone familiar with three-year-olds knows that they tend to flit from one toy to another, but this kept her attention for hours. She loved creating little gardens, mixing and matching flowers over and over. The blocks are really cute, and the butterflies are beautiful. I didn't even mind the gardens being left in the living room. Even the adults had fun playing with the kit. I plan to pick up several more for the other children in my life. I'm sure this would be a great addition to classrooms and daycare centers too.",

It is so cute, and is sure to be a hit with any little one; boy or girl.I Love the colorful array of flowers, and that the prices are not too big, but also not small enough to be too much of a choking hazard.My only complaint is that the plastic that makes up the pieces is a little TOO THIN. I can see not too distant future use of this product resulting in cracking or bending of the leaves and petals. But that would also mean it has been well used, and got its worth in play!All in all, this seems decently made, and the pieces fit together nicely; not too tight, not too loose.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this set to have an interactive desktop display in my home office and for a fun activity to do with family members who are children. Overall the building pieces are bright colored plastic with many options for assembly and design. I especially like that the base pieces can be connected in multiple configurations and stacked. The stem and flower pieces are tapered tubes that fit inside each other. The big downside for me is that the top pieces (flower centers and stamen/pistils) do not all fit snugly into the flowers. I think the tubes and toppers should all be uniform connection sizes for more flexible play and design. Instead the top pieces are smaller and connect to smaller holes, which gives fewer options. Also some are so small that they would be choking hazards for little kids. I would not use those pieces around small children or pets. The included butterflies are pretty but very flimsy papery material and there is no way actually connect them to the flowers. You just set them on top and hope for the best. Finally I noticed the base pieces I received are green, which matches the photo in the Amazon listing, but doesn\u2019t match the photo of the set on the box which had different colors and a purple base. When I looked closer there is a disclaimer on the box that says the specifications, colors, and contents may vary from the illustrations\u2014which is confusing. Why have a photo that is different from the set inside? This is a fun novelty item, but would be better with some adjustments.",

                "reviewTitle": "Great creative building toy",
                "reviewText": "I got this set for my kindergarten classroom as a different type of STEM/ building toy from other more typical building materials such as blocks, Lego, or magnet tiles, and it has been incredibly popular with both the boys and girls for the past two months!Rather than just build traditional flowers and gardens all the time, the children have started making their own building challenges with this toy such as seeing who can build the tallest flower, or seeing how high they can build a flower before it falls down. They also enjoy making rainbow gardens by using the different colours of flowers, and they like the butterflies - I also think it is a nice touch. There are lots of base pieces to make a large garden arranged in different ways (the pieces snap together and apart easily). There are also tons of stem and leaf pieces and a nice variety of flowers and stamen for the insides of the flowers. I enjoy that this set can be used by multiple children together and they are not arguing or fighting over pieces as there are enough to go around.In comparison to another flower building set that my own children have at home is why this toy recevied 4 stars instead of 5. Although it is a fairly sturdy toy (only two pieces have broken while being used nearly daily by 4 and 5 year olds), I do find that the plastic does feel a bit thinner compared to the other set. I also have one criticism, which is that to attach the flowers to the stems, you need a coloured straight piece, rather than the flowers just attaching right to the stem. This makes the flowers a little bit wobbly. Also, when putting the inside pieces of the flowers into them, they also don't fit as tight as I feel they should, and sometimes wiggle back and forth. Although this doesn't seem to bother any of the children playing with the set, I just feel that compared to the other set, it was noticeable to me.Overall though, I would highly recommend this set, as it is a very good price for a toy with many benefits - lots of building and problem-solving opportunities, great replay value, creativity and development of fine motor skills. It is perfect for young children at home or in the classroom, and is a great alternative for other building toys or for children interested in gardens or flowers too.",

                "reviewText": "This toy is more interesting than I had expected.Pros:1. Instead of a single, pre-assembled, non-adjustable base, this one comes with 12 dark green pieces that you can assemble in any shape you like: three small circles; one long wavy line; a big odd-shaped oval---your choice!2. The floral pieces come in 6 eye-catching colors: pink, light blue, turquoise, yellow, red, and orange. The leaves are all light green.3. Both the base pieces (which assemble with \"jigsaw\" tabs/male pieces and pockets/female pieces) and the floral pieces (which assemble with tubes and holes) are very easy for small children to manipulate.4. Every time the children play with this, they will be assembling it differently: 148 pieces ensure that. So it won't be same-old/same-old for them.5. The box it comes with is bright and pretty: great for gift-giving.6. It's a terrific way to get children interested in plants and gardening, and to teach them the names of flowers and plant parts (no instruction manual, here: you will have to do that research on1. your own).Cons:1. Caution! If you have small children who put everything in their mouths or if you have dogs, be very careful: there are a number of small pieces that could pose a choking hazard (especially for dogs, which have larger mouths than children).2. There is no storage bag included. Many other Amazon-sold toys with multiple pieces include a mesh bag for easy storage; this set does not. With 148 pieces, I highly recommend the manufacturer consider adding a bag to the set. Until then, I recommend anyone buying or gifting this include a mesh bag (a large dollar store laundry washing bag will do) with this set.Conclusion: Bright, happy, endless play that can assemble thousands of different ways. Easy to assemble. Beware of possible choking hazard for small children and all dogs. Buy a mesh bag to hold all the pieces. I would buy this again as gifts, and I recommend it to others without hesitation.",
