                "reviewText": "These blocks are so awesome! I LOVE the magnetic aspect of them. These are my son's first magnetic toys, and he's loving them! The magnets inside of the blocks shift a bit, so there's a bit of a satisfying click when they connect with other blocks. They're not super strong (the magnets), so don't hurt little fingers by pinching. But they're strong enough to stick together and be satisfying. I'd personally like the magnets a bit stronger, but the toy isn't for me, it's my son's, and they're plenty strong for him. :-)",
