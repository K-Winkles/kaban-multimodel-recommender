It is a favorite toy when either or both are here visiting. I love the fact the blocks are sturdy but yet slightly soft. The blocks hold up well for building but flexible enough not to cause severe pain if you step on one \ud83d\ude09",

They are as described, however the plastic they are made out of is incredibly thin, assuming so they can twist and bend. I was expecting them to have more of a squish to them since they are described as \u201csoft blocks\u201d. There is literally nothing soft about them, they just feel like cheap plastic.",

                "reviewText": "These are not soft. They are hard, yet flimsy. If you stepped on one in bare feet, you would yell an expletive. In the picture, they look huge, but they are not huge. In the picture, they look soft like silicone, but they are not soft. The picture of the blocks is superimposed over the picture of the kids. You're actually ordering a bunch of choking hazards, but not enough to do much with. The wheels that pop on one block do not pop back off and do not turn. So if you think you're going to build a car or vehicle that rolls, you're mistaken. I wold return them if I could fit them back in the box. They even included a plastic bag for you to store them in. I personally like to keep my kid's toys where he can get into them, but I also don't let my kid play with plastic bags. It would be one thing if this toy had been described accurately, but it was not. I'm glad I at least got them on sale. I didn't even bother showing them to my kid. They're in the garage where they will stay.",
