The instructions were straight forward and including debugging suggestions at the end. There was a lot of trouble shooting involved, but in a good way!He's assembled 4 out of the 5 builds so far and this is our experience:Wind Powered Car: This was one of the easiest to assemble. We had a user error and were able to correct it by reading the debugging suggestions at the end.Wireless RC Car: We couldn't get it to work. It would sporadically move on its own. We triple checked and everything is in the right place. We think the PCB board may be defective.Solar Powered Car: This issue with this one is that the battery pack was defective, one of the wires wasn't connected. We replaced that battery pack with the one from the RC Car and then it worked. It moves very slowly without sunlight. With sunlight, there was slightly more power. In the end, it worked!Balance Car: This build process was pretty smooth. We LOVE that it came with googly eyes. We're still working on the balancing aspect. It has a lot of power and would spin in circles until it hit a wall and then proceed to drive straight at a very high speed until it crashes.",

                "reviewText": "I'm always looking for fun AND educational toys for my grandchildren, especially my oldest grandson. I often find them inappropriately marked with \"recommended age level\" - usually much easier than indicated.This pack includes 5 kits, sure to maintain interest. If one is too easy or difficult, others will catch his interest until he grows into the others through experience and interest.The packaging is unique - each of the kits arrived in its own plastic bag with balsa wood punch-out pieces, mechanical or electrical components, connectors or screws, and instructions.All items are of decent quality and should last through many rounds of play - as long as the builder/owner remains calm. Once assembled, each item continues to educate with experiments and play.The instructions! Wonderfully clear, two pages (front and back with clear photos showing each step). A short but helpful \"problem resolution\" section will help get over major issues. The final two sections provide fun teaching moments- \"Science Tips\" and \"Think about it\" (an open-ended question to encourage cementing of knowledge gained through the project. Reading and understanding these will require (grand)parental assistance, especially for early readers. (My only issue is the small type font - readable but requires decent lighting and plenty of squinting!)Great gift to explore together!",

The projects themselves are okay - they definitely require some adult help for a kiddo his age. Once the projects are done, they look pretty cool, but the disappointing part is that they don't really work the way they're supposed to. For example, we built a battery powered airplane that was supposed to use its propeller to move across the ground, and while the propeller did work, it didn't move the plane at all. Overall, these are cute projects, but they're not functional.",

It is very simple and easy to build (though some of the wood notches didn't line up perfectly). The structure of cars and planes are on wood cutouts, and there's a simple motor get the cars moving. Each kit is individually packaged and the instructions were clear enough. I like how there's paint to add color to your finished pieces. Each of the pieces require 2x AA to get the motor running. This kit makes a great gift for a young child who loves building (and destroying) things.",
