                "reviewText": "The string is entirely too short to be able to pull this wagon around the house by a small child....that is a big bummer.This is not a wood block set that will be around for generations to come.....they are basically cheap wood of some sort. I don't believe that these will last through hard play by toddlers for more than a year or so...I will come back to the review in the future to update.The blocks are really small.....nothing like the solid wood blocks that I had as a child but I guess I am old at 55! I don't think that these blocks are so small that they are a choking hazard, I mean they are square and larger than something you could swallow so I don't think you have to worry about that....but one never knows.The blocks are colorful, capture the attention of toddlers and offer learning experiences. They are obviously great for learning how to stack! You can easily start to introduce these blocks to a baby that can sit up themselves. You can show them each block and talk about the pictures on the block. Learning primary colors is another benefit of these blocksKinda expensive for lower quality, small, wood blocks. Not sure that I would give as a gift.",

The blocks itself looks sturdy and I believe this is something she will drag around her mom's house especially with the wheel. Some of the paint seems to be lifting already and Iam a little concern with that however I be wrapping it and putting it under the Christmas tree.",
