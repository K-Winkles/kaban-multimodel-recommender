                "reviewText": "These were not bad to put together at all. I just sat down and watched a TV episode and breezed through them, not even having to concentrate on what I was doing. Once put together, they are strong and sturdy. I can stand on them easily and I'm just over 100lbs. See photos to check out how they fit together.This was our second set of these blocks. The first set we had for three years and they were still going strong and were my son's most played with toy. He and his friends made mini golf courses out of them, towers, and fort walls. They even used them as cannons or something in a favorite game where they threw them at each other. Repeatedly. We had to make an out of state move and because these take up so much room, I wanted to leave them behind and get a new set in our new place. I wasn't willing to get rid of them completely! They offer too much endless fun and creative play. Somehow, one block from the old set ended up in a box and moved with us, so I took a couple of photos to show what it looked like after years of HEAVY use. In the photos, the old block is on the right (logo and phone number printed on it) and the new block is on the left. The blocks held up really well for all they went through!Once we got settled in to our new place, I bought another set. My kiddos enjoy them. My son builds towers all the time for my 1 year old to knock down. When she gets a little older, I'll use them combined with pool noodles to make obstacle courses.These are one of my favorite purchases I've ever bought for my son!Storage tip: these fit perfectly in a Sterilite 110 quart Clear View Storage Bin with Latch.",

                "reviewText": "I am only listing cons in this review because although I LOVED these boxes when I was a kid, I HATED them for my 2 year old.. This is a 5 star review because they are exactly what I was looking for, BUT I still ended up returning them and here's why...CONS:***Sharp corners and edges!!***This is my main reason for returning them. First day we played with these blocks my 2yo ended up with 2 cuts VERY close to her eye from falling blocks, and a cut on the bottom for her foot after slipping off a block she was balancing on. Seemed like EVERY TIME she played with these she'd end up with a bruise or a cut. She never misused them or played recklessly with them, she'd simply stack them up & knock them down or line up & walk across the red ones. I'm surprised there aren't more reviews mentioning injuries, maybe my 2yo just needs tougher skin??Either way, I think it ought be mentioned! (Especially since they are marketed for 2-5yo who have notably delicate skin!).**Price**Although I thought the price was fair, my husband disagreed. (He's wrong though, so nevermind him!)**Durability**Although I think these are durable enough for what purpose they serve; the description embellished a bit on HOW durable.. The red block buckled under my nephew's weight, he weighs ~80lbs. (Claims in product description that red blocks can withstand 150lbs).**Assembly**I actually had a lot of fun figuring out & folding these. My husband and I even had a race to see who could fold boxes faster (I destroyed him!) That aside, my husband was griping about the task before we had made a game of it.. so I get that people loathe these boxes after they've spent an hour folding them.**Too 'easy' to knock down**These boxes are laminated so they can be wiped down, which is great!! BUT it also makes the blocks SO slick that if you lightly bump into your structure or sneeze too hard it might cause the whole thing to collapse![Pro-tip for anyone who 'got time for that']After returning these, I got to thinking.. if you added some small dots of hot glue to the sides of the blocks it would make them less slick; hence, more build-able. And if you put hot glue along the seams and corners of the boxes it might also make them a little safer.",
