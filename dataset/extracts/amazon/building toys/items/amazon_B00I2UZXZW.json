                "reviewText": "This is a great set for the money. You get 480 pieces in this set. The best thing is these sets work with others so you can combine them to make bigger construction models. It really challenges the minds and imagination which is very important in this day and time for children who mostly spend their time on video games and tv. It is good quality. There are a lot of small pieces so need to get a storage bin to keep everything organized especially if you are combining with other K\u2019nex sets. Would definitely recommend this for all ages.",
