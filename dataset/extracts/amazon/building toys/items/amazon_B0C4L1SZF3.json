                "reviewText": "I love these blocks so much that I ordered a second set of them with different colors/variations than the first set. They are the perfect size for building and aren\u2019t too big or bulky. I would definitely not recommend these for any children that still stick things in their mouth, though, just because they\u2019re small enough that they could potentially get stuck in their mouth.The images are printed on the blocks (not a sticker) which adds a much nicer quality to the item. They work well with other brands of magnetic block sets I\u2019ve gotten in the past. There are no visible seams on the blocks, which eases any concerns I had over the blocks breaking open and spilling magnetic beads.They fit really well in a small 5x7 photo box that I keep in my child\u2019s going out bag. They are a wonderful toy to keep kids occupied in the car or out at dinner instead of just sticking a tablet in front of them. They are great for imaginative play. I\u2019ve seen some reviews where the other brands of magnetic blocks don\u2019t come with enough to build the cool items featured on the boxes; however, this set came with a decent amount of blocks and I thought it was more than enough variations in colors/designs.",

                "reviewText": "My 6-year-old son has been playing with these nonstop since he received them for Christmas! He likes watching Minecraft videos on YouTube but isn\u2019t old enough to play the computer game, so this is a way for him to experience the creative aspect of Minecraft and I like that it\u2019s tactile rather than virtual so probably better for his developing brain anyway. We did get him 2 sets of the 100-piece which I would say is the minimum you would want to be able to actually build anything significant. We later bought another set of 100 and also a 72-piece mining set. The pieces are high quality plastic, at first I was surprised at how tiny they are but actually if they were much bigger they would need larger magnets inside and it would get to be a heavy/large/cumbersome toy. They are just the right size and take up minimal space to store. My 4 year old also enjoys playing with them but they don\u2019t keep his attention as long.",

                "reviewText": "These are such a cute idea. My older kids are obsessed with minecraft and my two year old wants to play so bad with the. These look like the minecraft cubes they play with on the tv which allows my two year old to think he is playing minecraft too!!!! They have balls inside them that jingle when you handle them and the magnets are very strong which allows hours of designing.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two sets of these. One set first that did not say, and even seemed to go out of their way not to say how many were in the set [48 as it happens]. A small box, though I think they call it introductory somewhere. No, that is not enough though and I found that deceptive. But when I got them, I loved them so I bought this bigger set that had 100 pieces. So now I have enough for my grandkids to share. If I get a windfall, I might buy the Frozen set too, but I'm good for now.I buy Brio and Thomas train and legos too, so I know some things just cost a lot. These also will last a long time, like legos and our trains, you can pass them down from kid to kid. I can keep them on a shelf for my grandkids and any other kid that comes around, and to play with now and again myself. I love the rattle sound and the feel of the clack as each pulls together. I think they stick together decently well and I was able to build a tree with pieces at an angle as well as the basic side to side. I think these would be great for kids or adults that like sensory amusements. Nice to run your finger across, kinda has a fuzzy slightly lifted feel. It is a plastic texture but feels good, and is well built.To save you trouble, I read lots of reviews and these and the one's with TNT pattern are not the same size. I did have a hard time deciding because I loved the flower pattern on the others but went with bigger. I have a young grandson and thought bigger would be better. They are still pretty small though, so do keep that in mind if you have very little ones. Almost but not quite one inch per side.",
