The paint is well coated on each piece and they are bright and attractive to children. The pieces fit into their hands nicely and they are able to stack, connect, and build with them. They also use them in conjunction with other building blocks, and have the 'gingerbread men' walk through their buildings and across their bridges.. it's really cute and I am happy we have these. When I am sitting with them I can casually talk about how many of each color there are, and if one 'goes to the store' how many are left? Or if two come home from school, how many are home now? etc. So many ways to play with these, and they are easy to put away and clean.",
