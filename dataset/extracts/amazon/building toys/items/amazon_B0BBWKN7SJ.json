                "reviewText": "So, we'll lead with the disclaimer ; I know that a lot of people do NOT like the super vibrant highlighter-yellow that LEGO has been using in recent sets. I'm not on that list, as long as it's used *well*. There's moments where it makes all the sense in the world - emergency vehicles for use as a visibility aid, safety vests, high-spec 'tuner' vehicles that are SUPPOSED to stand out ... and even then, not usually as a primary color. This particular use fits into that last category.So the set is an obviously non-real-world inspired electric sports car. The set is designed for 5+, has no stickers, and has what I feel is a perfectly good, sleek look to it. The implication of electric batteries in the back as the main power source is .. a little cheesy, but perfectly reasonable for the age range intended, and is easily modified if desired. The set's build is fast, simple, and on the whole pretty enjoyable.The only flaw is that the set provides no good charging points on the car itself - the only studs that are accessible for that use are by the front of the windshield, and both of them are 'glass'. I understand that there's a bit of a careful parts budget here, but LEGO really should have worked in a single stud on the side somewhere to serve as a charging port. Still, that's a fairly minor flaw, and not one that will detract form any kids who want to play with it - and they *are* the target audience, to be certain.",
