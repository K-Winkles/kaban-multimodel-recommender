                "reviewText": "Great Building Toys!I wasn't sure about these as they are just plain wood planks but I ended up taking a chance on them. I'm so glad I did! They were a hit with 3 kids - a 4 and 10 year old boy and their 8 year old sister. Mom and grandpa even got in on the fun! I'm sure this will be a toy we end up playing with as a family often.I always like to see Pros and Cons when I read reviews so here is mine for these wood toys:Pros:- Kids love them (that's probably the biggest)- It keeps kids away from a screen for a while.- They can build anything they want with these. The 10 year old boy has decided he wants to build the Washington Monument next, the 4 year old wants to build a fence and barn for his dinosaurs.- The price was really good compared to other similar sets- It's a quiet toy - no bells, no loud noises and no batteries required.- I like the idea of them playing with a classic toy that's simple and using their brain and imagination to come up with something creative.Cons:- It doesn't have directions but it wasn't an issue as almost immediately the kids took inspiration from some of the pictures on the box and started to build. Besides, kind of the whole point of these is for the kids to figure out what to build and how to do it. Classic toys are classic for a reason. I like the idea of kids having to figure things out for themselves and not have everything spelled out and handed to them.- This set doesn't come with a bag but it isn't that big of a deal as the kids just put them back in the box. When that gets old for them I'll dig up a bag for them to use.Overall:I'm really glad I bought these. They are really fun building toys that kids and adults enjoy playing with. With all the different kids parties we have to attend this is going to be my go-to kids birthday present from now on as I know it's a gift all ages will like.",

                "reviewText": "The simplicity of the wooden planks is not only easy for any child to use and play with, but it also creates a platform for the imagination. I know my 6 yr old son loves to build fortresses with it for his rob lox toys to hide in, but I see that there is careful thought put in how he builds everything. He is the architect and I am the helper. However, I have found myself sitting there just as focused as he is trying to build my own masterpiece. The wooden planks are extremely sturdy, yet light enough that they do not pose a risk if they were to fall. I will also be using them when doing math problems, as it can also be used as a visual in addition and subtraction problems. I would highly recommend this toy.",
