                "reviewText": "I read tons and tons of reviews for different marble runs before settling on this one. I agonized over the reviews that appeared on almost every different marble run, saying the pieces don't hold together and the structures fall apart. I ended up buying this one, despite a few negative reviews, and it works great! The pieces hold together very nicely, and my 7-year-old and almost-4-year-old love playing with it. When we first got it, they spent no less than 6 hours that day playing with it, and at least 4 hours a day for the next few days. It slowly petered out over a week or 2, and they gradually lost interest, but will still get it out every few weeks and play with it for an hour or so. Not bad for $40. I love that it comes with a handy, drawstring bag so we can pack it all away, all together, and the pieces don't get lost. It's also great that it came with so many marbles, because somehow those DO disappear, despite our best efforts. For the reviews saying structures fall over; this is not really a fault of the toy, in my experience. You do have to build with a little intelligence, setting the towers up in a triangular or square pattern (or any kind of staggered pattern, really) for stability, not all in a straight row, which would be easily knocked over. My kids learned this very quickly. My 7-year-old very quickly learned to build complex, fully functional structures. My almost-4-year-old likes to run the marbles down structures that someone else builds, or just play with the pieces, connecting and disconnecting them, sorting the colors, collecting and hoarding marbles, etc. He doesn't quite \"get\" the concept of making a functioning marble run on his own yet, but that is fine; both kids enjoy the toy a lot. Only 2 pieces in the whole set do not quite work properly; the two that look like curving roller-coaster tracks; they are just slightly warped, and the balls would stop running on them, so we stopped using them. All the rest work perfectly, and we are very happy with it.",

The set came with visual instructions for 2 example marble runs, which was great for a new marble run enthusiast.I only have two complaints about the set. The glowing marbles are adorable, but they don't move through the run very well. They are slightly lighter in weight compared to regular marbles, and they are slightly larger than the other glass marbles.My second complaint is that a few of the smaller connector pieces are loose when fitted together; making some areas of the run less sturdy than others. My younger children get upset when some of the pieces fall off.Compared to other marble runs, it is a good set for the value I paid. I would purchase it again and may purchase a second set for larger projects.",

My wife and I enjoy building unique structures for our toddler and he loves seeing the marbles to run down the course. It is difficult for a young child to assemble by themselves but with some slight help from an adult it goes together in no problem. Plenty of pieces and marbles to make whatever course you want or you could mimic one of the three courses they provided pictures of. A great alternative to screens and provides some kinetic excitement compared to standard legos/blocks.",

                "reviewText": "First off I like how this item comes with 20 glass marbles instead of the other misleading listings that state it contains 200 amount of pieces but it's actually 60 or 80 halves of plastic balls. The tubing and pieces are good quality. The building instruction sheet is practically useless. It shows no steps and the angle of the complete set makes it hard to tell what goes where. After 30min of following the photo I realized it doesn't even come with the same pieces so either it was wrong colour or I was missing some pieces. Regardless I was able to slap it together and once completed it was great fun for the family to race the balls down the track! My daughter is only 3 so she couldn't really figure out exactly how to place the tubes together for an efficient run but it was fun doing it together.There's pros and cons to playing on carpet or hard surface. On carpet the set won't be as sturdy but on hard surface the balls easily start rolling away! It's only been a week and I've already lost 3 balls haha (I suspect they are under the fridge)I plan to re-build a big long run when I have the time. Maybe even get another set to put together in the future.",
