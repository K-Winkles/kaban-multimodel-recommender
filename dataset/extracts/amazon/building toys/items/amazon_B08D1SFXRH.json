The new set was easier to build and was super sturdy.It\u2019s so rare these days to receive customer service like that, especially with online purchases.

While it's fun for my daughter to play with I'm a little disappointed in the product at this price.First, DON'T waste your money on the glowing version like me. Trust me what seems like a measly $5 isn't worth it unless you want green to begin with. The glow factor is laughably weak and dissipates really fast. You essentially need a high power flashlight directly against it to get it bright enough to see in a dimly lit room. In the dark it's _barely_ visible after being in a normally lit room. The glow feature is 100% useless.Second, the pictures in the listing are misleading with the kids shrunk to make the product appear larger than it really is. Read the measurements and you'll realize you're not building a fort with just one kit. Do the math and you'll realize the kids in the picture have 6\" diameter doll sized heads. False advertising at it's best. This leads me to the price, which I almost want a second kit to build stuff that's actually cool for the kids but $35 is a LOT for some plastic sticks and balls that are pennies each to produce. This kit would still be profitable at $15, let alone $35. This is way too expensive for the several dollars they've spent in plastic. Plastic has gotten more expensive the last few years, but not _that_ expensive.Now I'll get to what's good about it. The difficulty to assemble people claim is probably weak mothers and grandmothers that lack the strength to shove the rods in the spheres. It takes a bit of force but you'll quickly realize this is necessary as they'll quickly loosen to a manageable amount of force needed. If they were easy to shove together at first they'd fall right out after they get used a little. This was a good idea by the manufacturer when my 2yr old can pull them apart easily after only a few hours of tinkering with build ideas.When it comes to the durability this is also what makes it not so sturdy. The pieces have a decent amount of flexibility to them. This is great to make the pieces themselves near indestructible, but that flex is going to make your kid's dream castle sag without structural integrity. Think of the flexibility of a pool noodle. I tried putting a fairly thick blanket on her new \"castle\" to have it topple immediately. Switching to a black satin sheet off my bed to block out the light so she has a hidey hole was a fine remedy.Will I buy a second set? That's a strong maybe because I want to build bigger and more intricate things for the kids, but I'll be doing it knowing I'm paying way too much for what I'm getting, which is $5 in plastic with a 700% markup.Don't think I'm negative overall on the product, I just want people to know what they're getting. It's smaller than it appears. It's flexible so curb your expectations in what you'll build, but it's great fun for those of us that grew up building forts out of mom's couch cushions and want to do the same for our little ones. It's hard to put a price on that.",

                "reviewText": "My kids love forts. They love building forts. They usually build elaborate forts using dining chairs and every blanket in the house. I saw this item and thought, \"the kids would love this; they'l can build anything they can imagine\" and then I also thought \"they'll stop dragging my dining chairs into the family room\". Win. Win. \"I'll buy two!\"Unfortunately, this has been a lose lose. Upon opening the box, the kids immediately started complaining that they couldn't get the rods into the connector balls; it was too hard. And they were right, the rods really didn't want to go into the connector balls. So I harnessed my inner mom strength and forced a bunch of pegs into a bunch of holes and started to build a structure. As I did, you might think, \"oh, well they make the rods difficult to force into the holes so they'll be secure once they're in\" but as I also was, you'd be wrong.As I began crafting a frame that would surely be the fort of of all forts (mom to the rescue!), with each new connection, a prior one broke. I worked at it diligently with the kids for an hour and could barely make any progress. Every time I made a connection, an older one dislodged. We couldn't make enough progress on the form to even get close to consider draping a blanket over it; but I assure you, it would not be able to handle even the weight of a sheet. It crumbled under its own weight and poorly made pieces. Heck, it fell apart laying on the floor when it wasn't being touched.This product is a horribly made, waste of plastic, time and energy. Do not buy. It doesn't work. It's left all of us frustrated. The kids are once again dragging my dining chairs into the living room to build a fort, but at least that will stay up.",

                "reviewText": "This has been a great gift for my boys! It's an awesome STEM toy.They are 6 and 4, and they love making forts. The parts are a little more difficult to assemble for my 4yo but my 6yo does really well with them. They require some strength at times when the poles are inserted into the balls. Not all of the holes are the same size, and some are impossibly small. However, there are so many pieces, and options for holes, that most the time the balls can be twisted to fit just right. I'm the type of parent that doesn't mind if my children are given a little hard work when they are playing. It helps them down the road with problem solving.The sturdiness is not an issue. According to some of the reviews, people claim that it can't hold up a blanket. I think these people are just incompetent when it comes to building a structure. I had no difficulty helping my 6yo build this large fort and many others, and it has held up a sheet perfectly every time.",
