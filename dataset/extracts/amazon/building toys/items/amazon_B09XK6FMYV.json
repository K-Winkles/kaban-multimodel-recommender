                "reviewText": "Let me first say I purchased this for a 3 year old boy. I saw all the reviews saying that they purchased it for girls, but I couldn't see why because they are just tiles! My 3 year old and I love mixing this set with another one I have to build larger structures. I also think the steps, doors, and two tiny dolls are cute features.I will say that the label of 102 pieces can be deceiving as it comes with \"windows\" that you place inside of the tiles which seems to account for at least 60 of the 102 pieces. I purchased when it was a lightning deal, so I wasn't put off by the ratio of tiles to pieces. It is easy to put together, clean up, and a toddler can be very creative with the opportunity to incorporate the steps, fences, etc. Great purchase thay I would definitely recommend.",

They\u2019re castles, spaceships, monsters, you name it. I will likely buy another set in the future to keep two kids quarrel-free. The colors are so pretty\u2026it\u2019s giving Frozen. The interchangeable doors and window pieces are cool too, giving bigger kids especially some neat options for constructing. Highly recommend\u2026just consider a few sets for multiple kids!",
