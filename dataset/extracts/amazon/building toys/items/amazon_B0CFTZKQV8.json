The pieces are super easy for them to handle and click together, which is great for my little ones who are always on the lookout for a new adventure. What I love is how sturdy yet safe the pieces are; I don't have to worry about them breaking or causing any boo-boos. Plus, it's been amazing seeing their little imaginations go wild as they come up with all sorts of cool structures. And when playtime's over, everything packs away neatly, which is a huge plus for me. The only heads-up I'd give to other parents is that if your kids are big on building, you might need to grab more than one set to keep up with their grand designs. Overall, this kit's been a fantastic buy for some creative, screen-free playtime!",

Not sturdy enough to endure a 5 year old who has autism and wants to pat down the roof \ud83d\ude05 it is fun for my husband and i to figure out what shapes to build to maximize sturdiness and practicality. It is challenging the first few times! But we had enough to build where we could all fit in. The only 2 reasons i give it 4 and not 5 stars is because it really starts hurting the fingers when it is time to squeeze and pull apart the pieces to take down and it would be really clutch if there was a way to make these sticks almost adjustable spring loaded to adjust size. But dont let that prevent you from buying it if you are considering getting this for your child who LOVES fort building, it is definitely worth it. We will be using ours A LOT!",

I will say just 1 pack truly is not enough to make something big enough for adults to enjoy as well. We purchased 2 packs and also got 2 extra large flat sheets to make a complete fort/clubhouse. So much fun for the whole family.",
