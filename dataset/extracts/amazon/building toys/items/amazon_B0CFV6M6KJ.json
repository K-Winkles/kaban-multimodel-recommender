Montessori stacking toys are educational toys designed to help children develop fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness, and problem-solving abilities. They also encourage concentration and focus. At what age can children start using Montessori stacking toys? Montessori stacking toys are typically introduced to children around 12 months of age when they begin to develop their grasping skills. However, the specific age can vary from child to child. What should parents look for when selecting Montessori stacking toys for their children? Parents should choose stacking toys that are made from safe, non-toxic materials. They should also consider the size and weight of the toy to ensure it's suitable for their child's age and abilities. How can parents or caregivers use Montessori stacking toys effectively to promote learning and development? Parents can engage with their child during playtime, demonstrating how to stack the pieces and offering encouragement and support. It's essential to let the child explore and experiment independently while providing a safe and focused environment. Are there any specific Montessori principles that apply to the use of stacking toys in early childhood education? Stacking toys should be presented in an organized and inviting manner, and children should be allowed to choose and work with them at their own pace to foster independence and self-directed learning.",

My family did not like or choose to keep the rather large and poorly printed game mat. The blocks are large and chunky and limited in uses. Really a short term toy best for young kids ages 1-3. But, be mindful of the single white smaller blocks for any kid still mouthing toys (for littles those could be tucked away until later.)These are quality made, super durable and different than your average block. While we like them a lot our time spent playing with these has been short- the kids typically move on quickly from them.",

My daughter (5) had so much fun and didn't get bored with them quickly. I love that they come with a box to store them in.
