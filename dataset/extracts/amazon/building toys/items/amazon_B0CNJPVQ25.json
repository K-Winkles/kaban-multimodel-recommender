Pieces are very small, so may not be very enticing for some people. Me on the other hand, I love things like this. Clearly I am not done with it yet, but I\u2019ve been working on it! The pieces came kind of sorted in the bags as you can see in the pictures. They didn\u2019t come sorted by color or by step number in the instructions. Instead, they came sorted by the type of piece and color. So all of the clear flat 1x4 blocks were together but mixed with maybe all the blue flat 1x2 blocks and so on. I decided to sort them by color and then stack them by size. I have stored them in a compartment case that way I can close the lid when I am done working on it and not have to worry about losing any pieces since they\u2019re so small. The instructions I feel like are hit or miss. Some steps are very simple to understand while others are confusing and hard to tell in the pictures what pieces go where. But overall, this is very entertaining for me. I don\u2019t get bored doing it and it\u2019s very rewarding to see my progress along the way. I definitely recommend this! And I am definitely looking forward to getting another one!",

                "reviewText": "I was so excited to put this together. I LOVE \"building toys\" so this was a great option to a more expensive brand. Lots of pieces and lots of amazing details. SO fun right??Now, maybe I've been spoiled to that more expensive brand because it clearly details what is where and in which bag and has pretty foolproof instructions. THIS... was not that. EVERY bag has pieces from EVERY step in it. So you have no choice, but to open EVERY bag for this whole project. This is where it's no fun. I don't have a lot of space for building so opening like 9 bags of weirdly sorted pieces is ridiculous. You should definitely get some sort of sorting system going or you'll be looking for pieces for a while before you find what you need. And let's address the fact that these are MINI pieces so they're not the normal brick size. That makes sorting and trying to keep these things from going all over the place insanely frustrating. Add to that, they don't EXACTLY fit together perfectly so there was a good amount of shifting I had to do to get some parts to fit together. My giant adult hands kept flinging the smaller pieces across the room because they wouldn't snap together and once I applied some shifting and pressure it was like a catapult! (thankfully, they do give you a few extras of some pieces). It comes with a tool to pry pieces apart in case you make a mistake (which were plentiful), but I ended up using a tweezer a lot since the piece would bend sometimes when trying to get in the crevices. (great addition, but horribly made) I chose this alternative for myself so I can't be mad at some of the drawbacks, but good grief!Oh wait, it's fun again... Once your brain acclimates to the god awful sorting system and you start to figure out where certain pieces might be (Thank god the same pieces are sorted together) the build goes a little quicker. After seeing it start to come together, it gets fun again. It comes with a light kit for the water so I'm super excited to see that when it's all done. I still have a ways to go and I'm not sure how long this is going to take me as I only have a couple of hours each week to work on it, but it's going to be a beautiful build once complete. I would definitely recommend this set, but manage your expectations and be prepared with a plan of action... lol",

                "reviewText": "This building set is so beautiful! There are a lot of pieces and it is very intricate, so I would not purchase for a child. Luckily though, I am an adult who loves to build with Lego. This is a much more reasonably priced set, perfect for me!One of the biggest reasons I say this is for adults is because these pieces are so much smaller than Lego pieces. A 2x2 brick of these pieces is probably equivalent to the size of a 1 dot Lego piece. In fact, I highly recommend using a pair of tweezers to make it easier to handle and manipulate these pieces.I love that it comes with a light brick! That little extra elevates the set even more.My son and I are currently building this. It is not a quick one day project! It is providing an invaluable bonding experience for us though!I love doing something electronic free, especially in the evening. I can't wait until we complete this set. It's so beautiful that I am going to display on a shelf once it is complete.I highly recommend this building set! It is an incredible value and a lot of fun to build. Make sure you are buying for an adult or older teen though. The pieces are too small for kids to manipulate.",

That means you have to open up all the bags in order to find the necessary pieces for each step (a daunting task with so many pieces) . The LED lighting is barely addressed in the assembly manual and leaves something to be desired.",

                "reviewText": "This took my son days to complete due to the pieces being so small. I had to help thread the lights into the waterfalls and it wasn\u2019t easy to get them to stay but it is so pretty with the lights turned on. The large cherry blossom tree on top had a few pieces missing; not sure if we lost them when emptying out the bags or what. But that was so hard to put together that we gave up and put it in a bag to do later. This is definitely for someone with patience and it\u2019s rated for teens and up because of how small the pieces are. But I would definitely recommend. It\u2019s a beautiful piece to keep out as decor.",

                "reviewText": "These bricks are as micro as it gets (included picture shows some next to a lego brick), and there are no numbered bags. It took me hours just to pre-sort the thousands of pieces in a way that it became possible to start, and I still have trouble finding pieces sometimes. However they do stick well together (good clutch) and the directions are good though you're going to need to use some creativity with the lighting. I haven't finished it yet but it's enjoyable as long as you know what you're in for, and I am loving how the details are coming together.",
