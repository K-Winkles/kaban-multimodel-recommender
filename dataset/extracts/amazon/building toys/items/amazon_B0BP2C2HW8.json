                "reviewText": "I am a teacher and mom and I love this game for my own kids and may buy it for inside Recess! It is fun, involves problem solving and even though there is an extensive instruction manual with different tile combinations it can be very open ended as well! My 5 year old loves it, and this will be my go to gift for kids around this age for a while! It is something that at least initially parents should sit down with kids to explain how it works, but I would say after 3 days of playing he could probably independently play with this! Seriously cannot say enough good things about it!(Also they give 3 balls which is nice because I'm sure inevitably one will go missing)",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. We ordered this for my 6 year old for Christmas and honestly do not regret it at all! We spent HOURS playing with this. Not only following the suggested track options but he wanted to get creative and come up with ideas to create his own tracks as well. So I do LOVE this challenges his mind and keeps him off of electronics! However, even after carefully following instructions, we found that car will not always make it through the long track \"plans/ideas\" that book has suggested (video included). I have videos of other tracks where the car did succeed, however it will only allow me to upload one video. I included a photo showing that the 6 piece flat \"track\" can also be made into a 4 piece set which is sold as a separate kit, so if you are torn on which one to purchase, know that the bigger kit CAN be made smaller (and also includes more pieces for more options). We found we had the most success of the car making it through the track, if we started with marble already on the car. I helped my 6 year figure out his ideas by showing him to trace along the lines on the insert pieces to see if his planned track would work or \"dead end\". All in all, it was a lot of and good quality time together. It is definitely something that he is not ready to do solo at this point, but I feel it is good to help him problem solve and would recommend this product. But I will reiterate, that the car doesn't always make it through each course.We also went ahead and purchased an additional car, Incase his broke. But as of day two, the new car is still in the closet.",

Her 3 year old brother also could move the truck onto the track to participate. It was so much fun we bought this for another granddaughter (7 years old). She loved it too! It can we an easy path or can make it more challenging. We all had so much fun with this toy. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. If you have a small child that puts things in his/her mouth...be careful.

It would be nice if there a pouch to keep the balls in & his grandfather had difficulty determining the directions. Overall we are satisfied with this product.",
