It's easy to build with them as they don't fall off easily, ensuring that you can create something without any hassle. The kids adore it, especially when building cacti, plants, palaces, and pyramids. The cube design is excellent for constructing various things. They enjoy playing with it all the time, and the carry-on bag is a bonus as it prevents pieces from getting lost.\"",
