I\u2019m looking now to see how much more I can get to make his collection even bigger He said he want to build Elsa\u2019s Castle \ud83e\udd70 I absolutely love this little guy\u2026.Parents you won\u2019t regret it and there\u2019s not teeny tiny pieces you have to worry about It\u2019s a Must Buy in my opinion",

Not worth the $$ didn\u2019t get some shapes like pictured and definitely not the amount shown. Disappointed but it was a christmas present and they opened/ripped the box before I could notice.",

I was struggling to find a set I could use with an older style tile I have that is 5 or so years old. These do work with my original set so that\u2019s a huge plus! The set is smaller than I thought but hopefully using the 2 sets we can build bigger and better things! My 2 year old, 7 yr old, my husband , and myself love magna tiles!\ud83d\ude0a",
