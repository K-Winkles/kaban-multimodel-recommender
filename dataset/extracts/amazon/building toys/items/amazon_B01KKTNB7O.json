Add some enjoyment to your bricker's day by purchasing this set.The truck that comes with this set is actually quite large and very durable... so for those rough brickers out there (like my 3 year old son), this truck should hold up just fine. The truck is also large enough to hold a small ATV vehicle in the bed. The truck has two ramps that go up and down to assist in the loading process of the ATV.The trailer hooks up to the truck and can haul the other ATV that comes with the set. The trailer as well has two ramps to help with loading and unloading the ATVs.The two minifigs that come with this set are pretty standard, however, they do the trick.All in all, I would recommend this set. Though the set retails at $19.99, I would suggest waiting to find it for at least 20% off. If you're lucky, you might even find it for 30-40% off which makes this set a 'definite' buy.Great set with lots of playability.If my review was helpful, please click on 'helpful' below. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.Happy bricking.",

Even at ages 5 & 7 they are able to follow the directions, which are detailed, easy to follow, pictures. We started by building the ATV's first and of course the minifigs, (we lost the 5 yr old here, because the ATVs were just too much fun ). Then we built the truck and trailer. Once assembled it is a very sturdy piece, the kids drive the truck and trailer all around as well as the ATVs, and we have t lost any pieces.we have a lot of new sets and this is by far their favorite. I think we may need to purchase a second set !! Highly recommend.. fun for the whole family",

                "reviewText": "This Lego set was a gift for my 6 year old grandson. Of the gifts we gave him for Christmas, this was the one he wanted to play with first. He and I, along with his 4 year old sister, enjoyed putting it together. All of the pieces were there and the instructions were spot on. The set does have some really small parts, but if the pieces are grouped by type it was easy for him to put together and he barely looked at the directions. Great price through Amazon. Definitely recommend for lasting play-ability as the vehicles are really sturdy once put together.",

This Lego set was just right for him, and gave him and his dad a project they could do together. He did need minimal help, but was so excited and proud of himself afterwards. This has a lot of playability. It is a decent sized box, and is great for gifting on it's own. I definitely recommend this!",

Keeps them occupied in building the set, and they will then play with and adapt the sets as they go along. Storage of completed sets to avoid damage I guess would be the only 'con', but its a minor one on the grand scheme of things.Lego is one of those rare toys I don't mind buying - our kids always come back to their Lego sets, and will sit building new things for hours at a time from their imaginations. Much rather buy toys like this than the usual plastic tut that gets an hour of attention, and then just takes up space in the house for years without ever being played with again.This set was easy enough to build, our eight year old did it all himself with no help needed from dad any more. Just wish these sets were a bit cheaper - Lego seems to have gotten so expensive over the years!",
