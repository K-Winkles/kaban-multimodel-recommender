                "reviewText": "I like this playset. It's a way to spend an afternoon with my kids building a play garden on our dining room table. The colors are vibrant and the materials are easy to handle and the end product is nothing short of adorable no matter how young your kids might be. My kids loved the time we spent playing with this garden toy set.However; the product page feels like it's overselling this product. Which it doesn't have to. This set is perfectly cute and easy to use for my 2yo and 5 yo. Some of the set seems like a very unusual design choice as well. There's a try that doesn't quite fit well into the box. It's made of cheap plastic and was already massively warped by the time we opened it. There's a rake, shovel, and watering can include which we did use to play pretend, but the kids were mostly interested in building the garden. The set also includes two baskets which can be used for home decor or something, but you need to use your own Play-Doh or sand to keep it up.I mention all of these extras because it's just such a pain to put them back into the box with all of the things in the garden. The kids won't be able to close the box after you've opened it. You're going to have to optimize every little piece of stem and flower petal in order to close this box. We're thinking about scrapping the box altogether and putting it all in a bigger box.We used the baskets to keep all the butterflies and some of the stems. The butterflies are vibrant but they are very difficult to attach to flowers.The kids do love this thing though. We'll probably have more Saturdays and family gatherings where we have the kids play with this. 148 pieces is a lot. Just..in case your goal is to keep a clean house. Just letting you know.",
