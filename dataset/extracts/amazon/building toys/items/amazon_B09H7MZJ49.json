We make 2D and 3D builds which look so realistic and offer a great beginner building experience for my 7 yo. I mostly love that my curious 3yo can\u2019t accidentally swallow small pieces because there are none. The safety of these building blocks is very important. All pieces offer mobility which enhances the building experience. Because the pieces are magnetically connected and have round pieces, they can involve motion for children builders ready for a scaffolded experience. We absolutely love these blocks and recommend them for beginner builders.",

She loves to explorer with stuff like this because it helps her brain figure out how things work within science. This allows her to build as high as she can and we wide as she can. She also does weight tests to see how much she can support. Great find. This comes with tons of balls and sticks for lots of play.",

                "reviewText": "Our 2.5 year old son is in ot therapy and speech therapy weekly, so I've come in contact with a ton of toys (especially stem toys). One toy that our son is obsessed with (not just for 5 minutes) is SmartMax magnetic toys. This review will compare the two.Right from the gate I was not impressed with the size of the package. I already felt the stench of failure from this purchase, but tried to keep an open mind. As you can see from my picture, the Smartmax toys are noticeably larger (the blue and orange coloured sticks). The Smartmax set we own is not the XL set either.When you shake the sticks from this particular set, they rattle. None of the Smartmax pieces rattle or feel flimsy. I am concerned that the magnet could become a choking hazard in the future.This set also feels much lighter like dollar tree plastic toys. Most of the seams don't completely come together which might account for the rattling sound because the magnets aren't properly secured. They also give me the feeling that if one of us adults accidentally steps on one of these pieces that it will crack in half. I mean I'm not exaggerating how cheap this plastic feels. I wonder if its even safe for little mouths in regards to toxins?? A few pieces have white marks from I can only guess is friction while shipping because all the pieces were loose inside the box. The Smartmax toys plastic feels harder, more sturdier, and the color is more saturated than the set I'm reviewing. Overall I would not recommend until they change their materials, design, and quality in general.",
