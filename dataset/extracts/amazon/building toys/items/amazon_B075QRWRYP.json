                "reviewText": "Excellent Starter Set! This was a gift for a 4 year old that is new to Lego building! She has had Duplos, but she is more than ready to begin her Lego collection! I have used it as a gift before, so I knew it was tried and true! All kids love the carry case! Easy to take to Grandma's house or traveling! Nice way to keep your Lego bricks stored as well. We use it for other purposes, such as sorting by colors and counting bricks. Easy way to add a lesson or two into your day!For under $20, this is an excellent gift with over 200 pieces, detailed instruction manual and nice carrying case. Years ago, Lego did make a carry case with a base plate built in. That would be an excellent addition to this case, but the typical baseplate will not fit without cutting it down and gluing it inside. Yes, I have done that with other cases! So to make this a perfect gift, I sent it along with a Lego baseplate and the Lego 4+ Vet set so that she had a figure and a vehicle!It was nice to see her 4 year old imagination at work, but even better, it was awesome to watch the bond grow between grandparent and grandchild. What a special time they had together after the party. Lego building has now become part of their routine and their special time!It always makes me feel good when I can mold the future of a little one. I know what Legos have done for my own children and even myself. As an adult builder, it's fun no matter what set you build. Freestyle build or a set. The choice is yours. This can be either.As always, Lego brand is trusted for safety and quality. They can be handed down for many years and are a timeless classic.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these as a Christmas gift for my 4 year old brother as he recently got into legos and building things and he loves them! All the different colors and types of pieces allow him to have fun experimenting and building using his imagination instead of having to follow instructions for a mode set. The plastic suitcase is great as well as he has somewhere to store them, the only thing that would make that better is if it had better compartments to store the pieces in that way when it\u2019s closing they don\u2019t fall out or get stuck in the cracks.",
