                "reviewText": "Finding suitable brick construction sources is difficult. With Lego as the largest supply source, and their prices are rather high, and use specialized parts that take quite a bit of imagination to see any way other than what they're intended for(example: a treasure chest was in one Lego set I purchased. The instructions suggested alternative uses such as the head of a frog. The kid playing with that is going to be using a lot of imagination to make that work in their minds). That also means that other brands would need to be compatible in order to be competitive. Other Bulk Block sets fill the set with small parts to pad out the numbers, and have low quality control and pieces that either didn't get enough plastic in the mold to form the part, or at some point half melted. None of that from Brickyard!The pack I purchased from Brickyard has few small pieces(some are included but they're not used for \"padding\" of the numbers), no flawed pieces that I could find, and a good variety of colors. This is exactly the basic building brick set you want. So far this has been the best bulk building brick set I've purchased from Amazon. Totally compatible, good quality plastic(so far all good tight fits and no stress marks, I can't say about \"years of play\" from now, but a couple of days entertaining children of relatives is usually quite stressful enough on the toys), excellent quality control, and the right parts to expand your children's building sets to make a full structure instead of the facade usually sold.A minor quibble however: The package states 11 different colors. Technically accurate, but the dark grey color only applies to half of the \"roof bricks\"(as shown in the images), making it 10 different colors, plus the roof sections(which are either dark grey or red). And if that's the only complaint that can be made, these are worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "I got these for my 4yo son for Christmas. They were just under $10. These have been a hit. He has been building all kinds of stuff. This is an excellent way to really work fine motor skills and also use critical thinking skills on how and what to build. I got this after looking up toys for a 4yo and saw these were on sale. I was short on gifts for my son compared to my daughters so I just got this on a whim and to ensure he had equal presents. Well I\u2019m glad I got these because they are way better than I expected! They also come in a nice plastic container that closes. I will be recommending these to anyone with a toddler!!",

My grandson, who loves to put things together, really loves this! He said that his kindergarten teacher has them in her classroom. I feel like it was good luck that I stumbled onto this. They rate right up there with Brio trains, Legos, and Many Melissa and Doug toys. Just terrific! Sturdy too!",

The brickyard building blocks along with the windows, doors, fence and lamp post kit was the perfect gift and combination. This is only a start to his creativity. It was a bit pricy but way less than original LEGO. It's a great buy for growing creatives. I certainly recommend it. lots of pieces with different functions and very colorful.",
