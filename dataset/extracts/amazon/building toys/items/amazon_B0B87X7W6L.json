The dome is really too small for two kids over age four or five to both play in because it's too small for two to move around in thus defeating it's purpose.",

                "reviewText": "Makes fort-building super streamlined! Our kiddo loves it. Just make sure when you're putting the rods in the round connectors that you check where the arrows are and keep those sides facing up/down. (The instructions mention this) Also when doing angled roofs, make sure you're paying attention to what holes you're using in those connectors and twisting as needed to get the angles right. We use large sheets to cover the top and walls as they're a bit lighter than blankets and make it not so hot inside. The one thing this set doesn't have that I would love to see (as we needed it multiple times) are connectors with a vertical piece and then 2 to 4 horizontal pieces connected to it at NINETY DEGREE angles. For some reason all the pieces like that assume you're trying to make an octagon instead of a square so the horizontal pieces are not 90 degrees. That was the only annoying thing. Otherwise very happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for my nephew for his birthday, immediately after opening he had a blast the entire time.Building it in all different directions and different ways. Great interactive and building tool for children. Only downside is some of the projects on the actual instructions are very hard to construct and most you don't have enough to actually complete them. The pieces also have to be handled gentle or they break easily if you pull too hard.Other then that, an awesome gift that my nephew still uses! (Hes 5 years old)",

It held up pretty good but you also have to make sure you have knowledge in rocket science, mechanics or just a sturdy base. (Jk) People who have a hard time with this are using HEAVY blankets when sheets should suffice and are absolutely perfect. We give it an A!!!",
