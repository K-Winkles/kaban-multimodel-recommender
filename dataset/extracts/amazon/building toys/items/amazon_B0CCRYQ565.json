                "reviewText": "I learned something new today. A STEM toy stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. I can see how these qualify. You have to be a little creative to assemble any type of structure or design. These appear to be well designed and sturdy. I was surprised at the perfect amount of magnetism. I found myself playing with these. They actually stick to anything metal as well as each other which is a bonus. I was next to a metal door when I opened the box and stuck a few on the door. They held well. I would assume a refrigerator would work well too. They would be great fun in the bathtub, attaching them to the sides and building a bridge over the water. Maybe that STEM thing is working on me now.I would have loved to have these as a child. We played with small wooden blocks, which was fun, but lost their appeal quickly. You could probably combine these with those blocks or other toys for additional building and fun. The age rating of 3 to 6 seems about right. I would think with strict proper supervision you could allow younger children to enjoy them. I included a picture of the toys next to a quarter for size reference.I like the interlocking panels as well. These should help encourage children to be even more creative. Clever design. Magnets themselves are lots of fun.",
