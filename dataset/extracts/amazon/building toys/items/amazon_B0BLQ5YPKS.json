                "reviewText": "When the box arrived I opened it for my daughter and it was so easy and self-explanatory. I was surprised at how quickly she was able to put it together, and did it all by herself! I love the lights it came with, they were surprisingly bright!It had a lot of parts, there were a lot leftover that were unused, and she was still able to build a pretty big fort. It was something like 4 ft by 6 ft when it was done.It held up pretty well even with the sheets and blankets all around it, and right in our walkway lol.Overall I am very impressed and I think it\u2019s 100% a great kit for all ages.The box it comes in is good too because when you break it down which is also quick and easy, everything fits easily back inside.",
