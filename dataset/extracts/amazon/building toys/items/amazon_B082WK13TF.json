I work with kids with autism, and I am always looking for good assembly-type toys to work on motor skills and play skills and creativity, and this is by far my new favorite set. My clients love it too!! There are TONS of pieces , and they are all different, so there are practically infinite combinations! It's new every time it's used! They seem like decent quality as well, and like they will last a while, even with heavy use. I have two minor complaints: 1) some of the pieces (not all of them, only some, which is weird) don't \"nest\" very tightly, so they're really loose and fall out easily. 2) it would be nice if there were a few more of the \"base\" pieces, or if they were longer with the holes farther apart, so there would be more places to \"plant\" the flowers. Neither of these things are annoying enough to remove a star though - just minor complaints / feedback for purchase future improvements.",

I keep her toys put up and only bring certain ones out one at a time so she doesn't grow bored with anything she has. She is also pretty little so I'm hoping this set is something she will play with for many years to come. They really are pretty and a lot of fun to play with so I'm thinking in a few years she will really enjoy them!",
