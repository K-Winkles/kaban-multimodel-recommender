The pieces really move and the pieces were very bright and colorful. I was disappointed that the set was tinier than expected, but Savannah loved it and so I'm glad I purchased it. If you have tiny children in your home, or pets, I would be careful to keep this far away from them.",

The set provides hours of creative play, allowing her to recreate her favorite scenes from the movie Tangled. At age 6, she was able to put it together with minimal effort. It's been a fantastic source of entertainment and imaginative play, and I couldn't be happier with her joy and enthusiasm for this Lego set.",
