I got the kids each a set of pyramid blocks in different colors.. so they can play solo with them, or play together and combine their sets for 90 blocks.. then when they are done, they each get their colors and put them in their bag.These blocks are the most unique of the 3 sets. They are translucent and made of a hard, hole plastic, the others are a firm silicone that has a soft texture.These are compatible with the other sets, just made slightly different. They are just as easy to clean. Nothing wrong with them, I just prefer the silicone blocks, personality. My kids don't notice a difference and have fun with them!These seem a little less durable, but it's hard to remark on that yet.Nonetheless, these would make the best gift for a kid of any age!",

My 2 year old has a set of these already and we love them so I bought them a set. We spent an hour building different things from the booklet. At that point I had wished I bought 2 sets so we had more pieces. But this set came with more pieces than the one my son and I have, so that\u2019s a bonus!",

I don't know how to describe them. The photos are exactly what they look like. The box is accurate and appropriate for 18 months +. Good price.",
