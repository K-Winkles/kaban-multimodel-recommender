After sending an email to the manufacturer (in the product brochure) they answered back within 24 hours and they have sent me a replacement solar panel for it with no charge. Excellent customer service, will buy other products from them in the future.The only disadvantage of this little robot is there is no stop bottom, you have to disconnect it.",

ALTHOUGH, the fine print on the instruction manual makes it seem like the manufacturing isn\u2019t very precise. So maybe some robots actually work \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fFirst of all, it\u2019s not kid friendly. The instructions are pretty confusing for a kid. Notice the packaging says \u201ceasy-build pieces\u201d not \u201ceasy build.\u201d My husband and I ended up building it ourselves.First we built the walker-bot. Immediately after we connected the power and it started walking, it fell apart. We thought we did something wrong so we checked the manual and rebuilt it. Connected it to power, then it fell apart again.Next, we tried the Roly Poly-bot. Once we were finished, the pieces didn\u2019t even fit together properly! I tried holding it together to see if it would roll. It just fell over and spun around, and then the pieces fell off.I couldn\u2019t believe it y\u2019all. Complete waste of money. I\u2019m actually really good at following instructions and building things. I put together all the furniture in our house, etc. This thing is just so poorly made. My kid is so bummed and so are we. I wish I could give it zero stars.\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e",
