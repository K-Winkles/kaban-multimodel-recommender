                "reviewText": "Bought this for my 6 year old around Christmas time and he absolutely loved it. It was a little too much for him specifically to sit and do himself at first but with me standing by to give him a hand or just to point him in the right direction, he started picking up on it fairly quickly. It was such a mom-mazing moment to watch as he progressively learned to make these Suttle connections in his head to start visually being able to picture how something is supposed to look and making it come to life in front of his eyes. What an awesome product!!",

My four year old was a tad too young to follow the directions on his own, but It ended up being a really fun family activity. There are several planes and vehicles to build on their own - and then can be combined altogether to build a giant transformer like robot.I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll make it to that point, but it\u2019s fun to break up the building of the vehicles into multiple days. It\u2019s nice that it doesn\u2019t lose its luster after day one. I\u2019ll definitely be purchasing this again in the future as a holiday or birthday gift. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a Christmas gift for a 7-year-old boy. He is very into lego, so this was a hit initially. But it quickly became apparent that it was too delicate. It kept falling apart as he was building it. Lots of parts of the robot are attached by only one or two lego units. He eventually finished it, but he cannot play with it because as soon as he tries moving it an arm will break off. This is only suitable for display, which isn't what a 7-year-old wants.",
