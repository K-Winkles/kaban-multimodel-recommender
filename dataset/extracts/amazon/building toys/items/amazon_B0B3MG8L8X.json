They are different shapes with all sorts of different angles and edges and profiles.Kids can learn about physics, cantilevered, balance etc all through fun. They spent well over 1.5 hours the first day trying out different challenges like how tall can you get with the skinniest base etc.I absolutely love these types of toys and this set is a quality great set!!",
