He has some at school and enjoys building with them.They arrived quickly but the plastic storage container was crack on the bottom. I had to put some tape over it because the broken part is sharp.But the items inside the storage box were not damaged.The first thing he wanted to do was build a very tall tower to reach the ceiling. We have really high ceilings but with some help he was able to build it up super high.He has also built a fort with them.I would recommend this building toy. It\u2019s keeps kids busy and off the electronics. ; )",
