I'm not expecting perfection but this kit has issues.Pros: pieces are well made and I had very few issues where I had to remove little left over plastic from the molds. Stickers were excellent. The Tiger tank is well designed and was easy to build. The only suggestion I have is going with 40 tread pieces instead of 41 on the Tiger. It's harder to put on but looks much better.Cons: Where to begin. Minor issues. Neither tanks have full bottom covers to them which is kind of silly and would cost little to include and design. There are no M16s, mini guns, or what looks like maybe an SR-25 during WW2.Major Issues. The M4 Sherman design is bad especially the front section which I included a picture of. Section 13 where the front area connects to is badly designed and needs to be redone. At least add a 4x2 plate to top of the hinge section to have it attach better. It will hang lower on the two 6x4 panels but improves the connection. It disconnects way too easy. The M4's barrel does not move up or down but the Tiger's barrel does??? I still can't figure out what the M4 hoses are supposed to be. And what are the brown tubes on the sides for??? Again not asking for perfection but it seems like someone added those as filler.The M4 Sherman's directions are also a mess. I would suggest swapping the following sections around:Sections 2 and 3Sections 5 and 6Sections 7 and 8The picture of the tank needs to be turned around in sections 11,12, and 19.Conclusion: If it was me, I would completely redesign the entire M4 Sherman tank from beginning to end including directions. It's that bad. Add plates to the bottom of both tanks.The Tiger tank is just great and I really like it. Sure I would make a couple of minor changes but overall it's great.",

Most likely will be returning it!",
