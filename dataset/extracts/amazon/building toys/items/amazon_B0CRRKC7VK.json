The numbers are impossible to read and don't make sense, but at least the set itself isn't large, which makes them not necessarily important.Instructions : The instructions are not especially well printed, as they use the 'faded out view of what you built' method ... only faded to such an extent that it's almost impossible to see where you're meant to put things. Also, the color difference between green and dark green is minimal in some cases (but not all), and results in a difficult time figuring out which of the two colors you should be using at times.Parts quality : The finish on the parts is pretty decent, although the fit is variable between 'good' and 'way too tight'.Set design : The design itself has no significant flaws, and results in a decent looking pot of roses.Overall thoughts : Hard to recommend it with the flaws it does have, but if you do go with it and get past them, the results are at least pleasing to look at.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a life long LEGO fan, and lately I have been interested in these off-brand brick offerings... mostly because they produce models that LEGO will probably never make. This Peony set looks pretty amazing, compact, and cute in the product listing, and I suppose that it is. But there are problems.I have been pretty impressed with many of the off-brand sets that I have purchased, and I really wanted to like this one, as the price is amazingly low. However, the plastic used for these bricks is very hard, shiny, and doesn't meet the precise tolerances of true LEGO bricks. The plastic used for the green leaves is softer than the other pieces, so when you click them together, they will hold for a second and then pop apart. Ugh.Also, the building techniques used here are pretty terrible. The whole base, the beautiful blue and white pot, is put together using some absolutely strange methods that allow it to fall apart if pressure is applied in the wrong spot. And there are lot of these \"wrong spots.\" I really wanted to fix the build and continue, but that would have had me adding REAL LEGO bricks into this build, and I absolutely didn't want to mix them together.I ended up halting the build, as I just didn't want to struggle with it further. The blue designs on the white pieces are stickers, just in case you were wondering.",

I enjoyed building it, but I feel like the way it\u2019s put together was a bit of a challenge. Certain parts were hard to attach and I ended up putting things together in a different order than how the instructions had them. I also had a few leaves fall off as you had to break/bend them out of some extra packaging material to use them. If you enjoy a little challenge, you probably won\u2019t mind this set as the price is low. I don\u2019t think young kids could easily build this though.",
