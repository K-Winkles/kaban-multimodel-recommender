It was easy enough to figure out based on parts and color of the blocks.Since the pieces are a little smaller than the brand name blocks it was more challenging to put each mini figure together and we had to take some breaks because it was frustrating.Once assembled, we were able to create the larger model, we were impressed with the detail and design.In hindsight I would have given this to one of my older kids to assemble, but our 9 year old was able to finish it with help from an adult.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my 6 yr old nephew who loves dinosaurs. His face lit up when he saw it at my house and we had a blast putting it together with each other. I wanted to just go to the big Dino, but he wanted to do the little ones, so the little ones won out. The age states 8, so it was a tad complicating to him, but he pushed through it and his face when he got the Triceratops done was a memory I will not forget, he was absolutely beaming with joy. I definitely would recommend this product to anyone with kids 6-10 to have a fun bonding moment with. I absolutely loved how each little Dino came in its own packet so my nephew could decide which to do. I\u2019m hoping eventually to combine them, but he\u2019s having too much fun taking them apart and putting them back together",
