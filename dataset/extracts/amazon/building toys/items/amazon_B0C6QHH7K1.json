They say that their kids play with them for hours on end. I decided to start my 3-year-old on a smaller set to see how he would enjoy this toy. Turns out my sister's were right. My 3-year-old plays with this magnetic block set for hours. By far his favorite toy. At first he would just stack them into towers. And then as a week or two went by he became more creative and started creating his own fun sculptures.I find myself coming down and playing with him as well and we build things together. A wonderful investment for our family. It's not only fun for my child but also fun for me to play with!The magnets are strong enough to last through time. And the plastic doesn't seem to be too brittle or too soft. I'm not worried about the edges because they are beveled.",
