I got them for my grandkids and they range from 2 to 8 years old. They all wanted to play and build. Right away I ordered a larger quantity. I think they are at a good price and the blocks work just fine. Magnet seems good. The size is bigger but appear to be safer for little ones that still put things in their mouth. Would be nicer to go with more than you think you need. Would recommend and will in the future order even more. Was fun to see what they came up with. Really fun blocks. Kids approved.",

First of all they are very sturdy, they are not cheaply made and the magnets are strong enough to be useful but your child will love them over conventional block sets. This has some designs included but the real beauty of this set is the things he or she can come up with on their own and with the magnetics they can even defy gravity on some designs .
