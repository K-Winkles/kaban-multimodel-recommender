The pieces are quite small and could easily pose a choking hazard for any child still putting things in their mouth.For the appropriate age, I love these little blocks. Since every piece is the same shape, you would think it would be easy or boring but it's actually quite challenging figuring out how to build certain things. I plan to use these blocks at a STEM-based elementary school and challenge my students to build a weekly object as well as encourage them to explore with their own designs.I wish there were a few more building suggestions and that the brochure was a little larger because I would like to have a picture displayed each week for a new design and as it is I may have to scan and enlarge or find sample images online.",
