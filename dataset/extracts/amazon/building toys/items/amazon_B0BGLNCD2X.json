                "reviewText": "5 year old grandson enjoyed assembly and finished designs, but some of the metal pieces are a little too thin (bendable, flimsy, easy to distort or possibly break from bending). Be prepared...most of the screws are about the size of eyeglass frame screws. Too small to hold even with little fingers, need tweezers and/or magnetized tiny screwdriver for best success. Still, has been a hit with him and we had fun building together. He is adept at assembling things, otherwise might have been not age appropriate for 5 years. Their recommended age range is about right.",
