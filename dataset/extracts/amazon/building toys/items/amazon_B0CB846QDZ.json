You can build complex structures with these, so don't let the simple, obvious ideas fool you. I wish we had these years ago. Yes, these are fun for younger kids too, but you do have to be pretty spatially aware of the shapes and how the forces can be used to build complex things with them. These things were called Wedgits at his school, but these are the same as those, just different manufacturer.",

He has spent hours in the last few days enjoying these. It does say for 2-5 yr olds but I would not recommend giving them to a 2 yr old. The smallest orange block is very easy for a child to put in their mouth. My son immediately tried to put it in his mouth so I removed those from the set for the time being. The rest of the pieces are a great size for little hands. The colors are nice a bright. There are so many building options for these blocks and I love that it came with a book to give you ideas. Overall, I would definitely recommend for kids 3-5 or are out of the \"Putting everything in their mouth stage.\"",
