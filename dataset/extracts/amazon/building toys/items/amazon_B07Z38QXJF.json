They are so pretty and have wayyyyyy more re-buildability than I would have believed. I hate playing. Absolutely detest it. Games are fine but actually sitting on the ground and playing is not my strong suit, but there I was building right along side my kiddos. Until I had to stop because they wanted extra pieces.The box and pieces all feel sturdy. Everything fits in the box fine but unless you pack carefully the tray is useless. I put it in a drawer in case we decide to use the case for something else \u2014 not likely probably but you never know and it is a nice box with tray just not specifically useful with the flowers. There are some pieces my kids needed help getting out of the flowers.Anyway, stop reading and just buy them.",
