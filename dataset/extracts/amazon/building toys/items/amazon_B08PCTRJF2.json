Je les ouverts et 5 minutes apres je les remis boite! Si je pourrais, je le retournerais mais malheureusement je ne peux pas! Breff n'acheter pas \u00e7a prenez des cube normal car ils sont beaucoup plus robustes donc tienne vraiment mieux et en plus chaque cube a des animaux dessu. Moi jai acheter 2 sortes et mon fils s'amuse tellement ceux avec des animaux et 0 avec ceux l\u00e0 , les cube que jai acheter avant ceux la les 2 sortes avec des animaux ca cest de l'argent bien investi contrairement a ces cube ci...! Mon avis 1\u2b50\ufe0f sur 10\u2b50\ufe0f Et ses genereux!",
