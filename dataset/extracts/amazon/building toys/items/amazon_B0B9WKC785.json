I rolled the dice anyway.As it turns out, the instructions were done in a Lego style, and were pretty good. They put more steps on one page, but they're clear and easy to follow. All the pieces were there, with a few extra of small parts, just like Lego. You can tell the pieces aren't Lego pieces, but they're still quite good. They fit together fine, even if the fit isn't quite as tight.For the price, I can't complain. This is a solid set. It was a fun one sitting build, and the design is really good, with articulated legs and a head that rotates. Was very much worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "My 5-year-old kid is obsessed with guardian stalkers from Breath of the Wild. He loves Legos and wanted this. I was worried that since it isn't made by Lego, the bricks would be bad quality, but I couldn't be any more wrong. I was blown away by the quality of this product. Everything fit together well and it just looks so cool. I'm in my 30s, and I kind of want one for myself now.One thing to be aware of is that since it has so many articulating parts, and it has to stand on its legs, that it can be fragile if you actually try and play with it. It will be just fine if you put it on a shelf somewhere and look at it. My son wanted badly to play with it, and the armor on the legs and parts of the head were always falling off. I ended up using super glue on the more troublesome parts. I know this is very frowned upon, but it was either super glue it or deal with hourly tantrums from my child.Overall fantastic purchase, just be aware that you will need to glue it if you are making the purchase for a young child.",

Everything snapped together like I was building something put out from Lego and although the instructions were a little jumbled, it was fairly easy to navigate from step to step and figure out what needed to be snapped on nextIt's a 3rd party set so some deviations in quality are to be expected but it came with a ton of extra pieces so I wasn't too upset about having to replace that 1 heat warped brick out with a real lego since everything else was good.I'd reccomend this product for any avid Zelda fan or kid looking to have a great looking menacing robot to display or play with",
