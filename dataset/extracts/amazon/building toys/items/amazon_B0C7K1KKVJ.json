                "reviewText": "I just love magnet tiles, these are just as good as the highest-priced products out there. I like to play with them with or without my children. I love this set as it comes with arctic animals! The animals even have magnets in them. Most sets do not have stairs or curved pieces which makes this set more authentic. I love the blue and clear pieces as it looks just like ice! I highly highly recommend this set to any child! They are super durable and very magnetic.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice set of magnetic tiles in what I would call pastel colors. You get a pretty nice amount of the different shapes but 27 of the pieces are the white plastic \"window\" inserts. There is an alphabet sticker sheet that would be good for using as a learning aid with younger kids. The box comes with a couple gold colored cords to attach for use as carrying handles but the plastic lid isn't a very secure fit. There are also two Lego type prince and princess figures included as well as paper that shows some examples of what you can build but not step by step instructions. Overall this is a great set. The pieces fit and magnetize together well. There are a bunch of different shapes and colors and I really like the castle theme. Theses tiles are really great for letting kids be creative and think for themselves, they can build all kinds of interesting designs. These would be great for a gift. Highly recommended!",
