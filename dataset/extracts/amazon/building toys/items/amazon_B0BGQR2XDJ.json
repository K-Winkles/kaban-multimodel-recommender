They both are very interested in flipping the laptop open, changing the drink back and forth as well as turning the little people wheel.

Whether she is spinning through her rolodex, scribbling on post it notes or warming up that mouse - she is ready to work beside mommy!My girl is at a stage where she loves to imitate me so we decided this would be a great holiday gift for her (alongside a toy kcup machine). It is doing a pretty good job from keeping her banging on my laptop.It is pretty solid, so when she plays with the different pieces it doesn't flip up. All the items on the desk are in place very well, I don't have to worry about her tearing anything off.It keeps her attention pretty well and offers different sensory experiences. The rolodex spins and the cup (attached to the table) flips between cocoa and orange juice. The mouse makes clicking noises as it moves and the keyboard is semi-squishy.I wish I bought this when she was younger, because some of these features are aimed for younger kids but I feel she still gets alot of fun out of it now for pretend play. We are hoping to put off getting her something like a tablet to limit screen time (but ofcourse my husband is playing a game in the backround of the picture haha).",

It\u2019s basically a glorified version of a baby\u2019s tummy time mirror but fitted into the middle of the \u2018mini -office\u2019.In the centre of the desk is the laptop which folds up and down. The laptop \u2018screen\u2019 is a mirror and the keyboard are soft silicon squishable shapes for little fingers to press. Around the outside are a cup, a mouse, a pencil and a Rolodex. The cup has a disc you can switch to change from coffee to orange juice. The mouse has a mouse face painted on and makes a satisfying click nose as of slides along its tail. The pencil pivots to point to letters and numbers and the Rolodex wheel spins with different faces painted on it.It\u2019s all really fun and bring msgs predominantly in wood will be durable and just had the wooden toy classy feel to it.I feel it is more for very young babies, around that tummy time/crawling and early walking period. Maybe as they get to be toddlers, they might be looking for something with a wide range of activities to do. But it is a really lovely toy.",
