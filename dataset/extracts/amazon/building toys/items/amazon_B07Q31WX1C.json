                "reviewText": "I got this for my 9 year old son. One we got first has a missing part. I contacted the seller, they responded quickly and sent a replacement(whole set) \"Thank you\" But now the remote controller of my replacement doesn't work. I guess based on overall good reviews this just happed to me.My son usually have no problem to build LEGOs all by himself but this he needed my help 3-4 times to build it.Although he complained a little that his two thumbs were getting red and numb, I think he enjoyed.I can tell this would be a big challenge for 6 years.I love the structure but the quality of this products are a bit below LEGOs",
