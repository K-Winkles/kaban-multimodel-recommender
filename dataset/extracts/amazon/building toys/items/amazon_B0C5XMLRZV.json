                "reviewText": "I just gave this robot to my son, he is very handy and assembles 1000 piece construction toys with no problem. However, he has built multiple versions of this robot and the gears spin but get stuck. The solar power panel does not work at all, we have charged it for several hours and still unresponsive. Although we just started assembling it, I purchased it 2 months ago so I missed the return window but this is an incredible waste of time, money and my son is very disappointed on his birthday gift as is failing in multiple areas. I do not recommend this robot",
