These are about 0.75 inches. And this box they came in for this price is ridiculous. It needs a better box for carrying the blocks in because they are so small they will go missing they need something to go back into. And it needs some instructions for building things as well. But none of that came with it. The graphics are 3/5 and the magnetic capabilities seem fine. If it were maybe $20-24 I'd consider keeping it but not at $40.",

                "reviewText": "These are a lot smaller than I expected. I purchased them for an older kid (7) so I'm not worried about them being a choking hazard, but something to be aware of, especially as they are magnetic, if you do give them to a kid that might eat/mouth them. The magnets work well within the set, but if you try to use other magnetic cube sets or tiles, you'll be disappointed. Other than that, they match the game that (I assume) they are copying, so my son got a kick out of that. He wanted to replicate some of his virtual builds, but even those this comes with, what I thought was, a lot of bricks, because they are small, the builds are also small and kind of unimpressive, but that didn't daunt him too much and he had found recreating and rebuilding. I stuck these in an old lunch box and brought them with us to eat, they distracted both of my kids while they were waiting for their food and were small enough and magnetic enough that you can quickly and easily sweep them back into a container when you are done.",

                "reviewText": "My son is really into Minecraft and these blocks resemble the blocks in that game so these are perfect for building things from the game in real life. There is a good variety of different types of blocks. The magnetism is very strong. Like put two together, hold one, and shake violently and the other block won\u2019t fly off. I wish they were slightly bigger so they can work with another set of magnetic blocks that we already have, but definitely not a deal breaker.",
