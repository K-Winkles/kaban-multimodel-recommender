                "reviewTitle": "Strong Sonic set for fans, and solid mech for mech lovers.",
                "reviewText": "I've been playing Sonic games for almost 20 years, and when I saw this set, I didn't think \"OMG OMG OMG IT'S THE DEATH EGG ROBOT!\". I thought \"Omg. Not only did LEGO finally make another mech with a good pilot compartment, but with slight modification, you can fit TWO pilots\". Yeah. I'm a Sonic fan, but when I saw how good the Death Egg Robot was in screenshots and videos, I knew I was on board to buy the set just for that.The set itself is a must buy. Plain and simple. If you're planning to keep it forever, there are lots of things in here that will be worth having. The mech is one of the best LEGO mechs they've ever done. It's quite different from the Ninjago and Marvel mechs/robots. It's shorter, but thicker. There's a lot of weight and sturdiness to it, and I love it. I think it has some of the most finely crafted feet on any LEGO mech/robot. They're completely flat on the bottom, which in my opinion is the way to do it. Like in Sonic 2, you can pose the mech like it's fighting against Sonic, but unlike Sonic 2, you have a gatling gun on its left arm. I like this change. While stud shooters are wonky and messy to use, I think it adds alternate play value. And speaking of Sonic...The Sonic minifigure is quite good, but it has some hiccups. Firstly, there's an image for the set that shows Sonic winking. This made me think that there would be an alternate headpiece available in the set. There isn't. I feel like that was a mistake/mixup with another set, but still. Second hiccup: My Sonic minifigure at the very least has a printing error on his chest. Normally, modern Sonic's chest is supposed to be the same color as his arms. Mine is a gray color instead of the color of his arms. I immediately compared mine and the one on the box side by side and the one on the box has the correct color on his chest. I know that printing errors happen, and it's not the end of the world for me, but certain Karen Sonic fans will take offense. Otherwise, the minifigure is quite excellent, and as someone that mostly grew up playing the 3D games with green eyes modern Sonic, I love having him.The Dr. Eggman/Robotnik minifigure is going to be absurdly valuable in the future, unless LEGO releases more sets with him, which they might do for certain Sonic game sets. Still, this is currently your cheapest way to get the minifigure. It's a great figure. Makes the built one in the Green Hill set look silly in comparison.The little animals are great to have, whether you like cute things or want unique and valuable LEGO pieces for the future. I like all 3 of them equally.The set additionally comes with the newly designed Speed Sphere, which allows you to launch an encapsulated Sonic and imagine him running, boosting, or spindashing. It's great. If you gave me this 15+ years ago, I would've cried tears of joy. You can even use the Speed Sphere to crash Sonic into the mech and pop the jetpack off to free some animals. Other things in the set include a really small side build of a lab, which contains a little ball capsule for the animals to be freed from, and a small 3 piece spike tile, which emulates spikes from the classic Sonic games.I bought it at the full 79.99 Canadian price and I have no regrets.",
