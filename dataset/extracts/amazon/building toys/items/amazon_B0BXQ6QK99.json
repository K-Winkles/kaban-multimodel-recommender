                "reviewText": "For something that is meant to be played with a little, the dragon in this set is pretty fragile. I\u2019m not super bothered by the more decorational pieces popping off when it is moved, but the part where the torso meets the tail is ridiculous. There is one 8-stud flat brick on either side holding them together. That\u2019s it; nothing internal at all, in fact inside of this area has female to female bricks.In the picture, I am holding the sections together more than it might appear. Where the shift is is where it is not connected by anything else.The only thing that makes this acceptable for me is that it is the point where my child holds the dragon for playing with it, but he learned this the hard way & had it break apart quite a bit when trying to move a wing. He\u2019s 11, so he doesn\u2019t play rough. Fortunately, I am a builder, too, so I was able to figure out where things needed to be fairly easily with help from the book. &, yes, I checked several times to make sure that I wasn\u2019t missing something that would have held them together better; the steps showed that clearly.That being said, the dragon is cool looking & otherwise pretty well designed. The mech is nice and solid. The other thing is mid and I\u2019m skeptical of combining the pieces to make an upgraded dragon.I would not recommend it and would not have bought it if someone pointed out that flaw.",
