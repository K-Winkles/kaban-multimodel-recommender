                "reviewText": "These were such a hit - with both my younger children whom I bought it for, AND my older teenagers. There's something about these types of toys that just let you be creative, no matter what the age. There are 100 blocks, ten of each color. You can use the board they send, or just stack and create without it.The only misleading thing is the picture showing the blocks to be much larger than they actually are. I included a photo of me holding a handful of blocks - they're smaller than an inch square. But as long as your little one is past the phase of putting everything in their mouth - these would be rather difficult to swallow anyway - I think that even young children would find benefit from these as well.Quality of the blocks are good - even with my kids roughhousing and trampling of the blocks, we had no issues with paint chipping (they appear to be solid color through) or even chipping of the blocks themselves. The board is lighter weight and would be better for older kids (the grid is printed on, so you'd need to be able to arrange your blocks in there yourself), but it's more of a guide and storage than a necessary part of the item, IMHO.There are some photo cards to create pictures - smaller children will need adult help in recreating them (my 4 year old did at least), but even without them, all the kids were able to make their own creations happily. A great gift at a good price point, with no drawbacks.Highly recommend for your kids, for your grandkids, for birthday gifts or Christmas gifts, and as a gift that allows a lot of creativity at a fair price.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the 48 piece version of this item. The box indicates that it is a \u201cGeometric Puzzle\u201d when in fact it is a collection of 60 puzzles. There are 30 double sided cards that allow children to replicate their designs and they can certainly create their own as well. The wood pieces are fairly smooth although some have small cracks or splits in them. Some of the puzzles will fit into the box, while others need a larger space to complete. I would strongly recommend using a non slip mat under the puzzles because the smooth wood moves about very easily on a table, leading to frustration for the builder. The cards have one, two, or three stars at the top. According to the manufacturer, these indicate levels of difficulty. However, they appeared to be more random as opposed to sequential in terms of the puzzles\u2019 challenges. While my grandchildren enjoyed playing it these, they struggled to match some of the card designs. On those cards, there was an attempt to document depth of the blocks, but it was done in a darker shade and looked more like extra blocks. You can see this in the photo of the taller structure. Perhaps using photos instead of diagrams would work better. Despite that the children played with this for quite a long time. When they were finished, the prices could be put in the canvas bag that came with it or right back into the box. One of the nice features of the packaging is that there is a smaller cardboard tray that fits into the box, making it even sturdier. They opted to use one of the pattern cards to fit them in the tray. I\u2019m sure they will ask to play with this the next time they visit!",

                "reviewText": "Love this! Blocks come in a nice box, and are packed neatly into another box, within that one, that works well as a frame when composing the patterns -- so I definitely recommend keeping that inside box! The colors are bright, and all surfaces very smooth, with no sharp corners.There are some very small pieces, and it's a water based paint that the manufacturers say should not get wet, so NOT recommended for young children, ALTHOUGH this would be a terrific parent/grandparent friendly activity for children beyond that stage. I also keep thinking that with a timer, this would be great fun as a game with other older kids, teens, or adults!The pieces don't fit together exactly, and it was a bit of a squeeze to get the pattern pictured into the \"frame box,\" but I imagine smoothing the edges well accounts for that, and it's not much of an issue. Of course, the use of that box is totally optional; it still works, and sure helps pieces stay in place.I've included some extra pictures of the sturdy laminated cards, which are two sided, with more letters and numbers and patterns included.This will provide hours of fun for the children it's intended for. Can't wait to give it!Endless possibilities for creative people!",

She used it to create patterns, sort, stack, count, math (adding/subtracting), create letters, words, and match the blocks to the pictures. The versatility of using blocks in general for learning drew me to this item. Seeing how motivated my daughter was to use them naturally helped with offering learning opportunities. These blocks were sealed well and were compact in the seal which meant no dings or chipping from being rolled around throughout their shipping journey. The colors are well pigmented on each block, covered, and there were no variations in each block from another as far as dimension. Overall, this was a great purchase due to the quality, shipping, and value. And has also hit so many learning opportunities for our girl.",
