It's perfect for kids who want to work on their own projects when they're around other creatives! Also, unlike the plastic tool sets I've seen, this one is SILENT, which many parents should appreciate (especially compared to toy chainsaws and such!). The tool set seems nice and sturdy (so far, at least), and I love that the makers had the forethought to include little projects that the tools can be used for.",

                "reviewText": "This wooden tool box and construction set would make the perfect gift for any child. Kids can learn the names of tools and how to use them to construct wooden vehicles. The set comes with 6 tools....pliers, a hammer, a screw driver, a saw, a wrench and a ruler. It also comes with wooden bolts, screws, nuts, wheels and other assorted construction pieces that storage in a beautiful wooden divided storage box. Everything is made of solid wood that is smooth and finely finished so there are no splinters or rough spots. Also included are 4 sticker sheets and an assembly instruction booklet. I love that this set also includes several realistic truck parts such as a bulldozer, cement mixer and truck cabin. These special pieces are not found in other similar sets and they make the finished trucks look so much more realistic. My 4 year old grandson loves this set. He loves to use the tools and he can assemble the pieces with help. And once the truck is finished, he loves to play with his truck. The only draw back that I can find with this set is that there are only enough pieces included to construct one truck at a time.",
