The magnets are just strong enough to keep the blocks together and build things, but very easy to take apart. The kids enjoy making structures and people (and especially \"cookies\" which is what they call 4\u00d74 squares).Highly recommend these for imaginative play.",

I wanted something that they could all participate in together so there wasn\u2019t any fighting over toys so I chose these and a box of magnet tiles. Well\u2026 my plan didn\u2019t work as well as I\u2019d like because these were such a hit! Everyone wanted to play with these. It\u2019s so simple, yet there\u2019s so many different things you can make. I like that are all the same shape and I find it quite relaxing to play with these. My only two negatives are that I wish there were more in a box and that the magnets aren\u2019t too strong (like keeping a big build together)Overall, would love to order some more to add to the collection.",

                "reviewText": "I liked the multiple puzzle sides and that they are like building blocks that are slightly magnetic, enough to barely stick together. Each block makes a rattling noise which my son loves, like little maracas. Now what I didn't like.... I was shocked at how tiny this puzzle was. In a picture it shows it filling a child's hand... That would have to be a baby, plus blocks can fit into toddlers mouth. Maybe i overlooked description measurements (if there are any, didn't check) i went off the picture. It would make a great stocking stuffer not a birthday gift, i just gave it to my son rather then wrapping as a birthday gift. Its cute just not worth the price, you expect it to be bigger at that price or cheaper at that size. Didn't feel like going threw the return process and it's hard to keep up with the pieces so have to hunt them down. Easily lost bc they don't stick well and are tiny. You turn it with more then 2 blocks it doesn't stay together just falls apart which is odd considering the size.The pictures on it are detailed and colorful. My youngest loves that. But he turns it around after putting a few together (which causes it to fall apart due to weak magnets lol) to see if the other sides line up. They don't so if you have one side put together correctly all the other sides do not match. Then he loses interest. It's durable that's for sure. But painful if a kids throws it and hurts worst then Legos if you step on it lol pointy corners but they are mini blocks. It's a great concept and cute detailed pictures ,just too small, for me and mine, maybe good for the car if you keep up with all the pieces. I really wish it was bigger, am disappointed and wanted to love this bc it's a great toy just needs to be a little bigger. 6 blocks total in a cardboard box. Being that small and blocks hardly stick due to weak magnetics it should be cheaper. I bought it back in September before inflation got too bad. Lower the price and strengthen the magnets a tad and it'll be a 5 star or larger blocks with stronger magnetics then perfect!I hope this helps someone. If you're looking for a little travel puzzle then this is great! But if you think like I did that it's chunky blocks that could stay together after putting a side together think again.",

The set is a good size with 50 blocks. We took them travelling with us and the set kept her busy. It\u2019s nice that the set comes with a booklet with building ideas which was quite helpful. We also use them as counters and my daughter learned to group them into the same colours. The magnets are not super strong but it\u2019s enough to build with 2-3 blocks hanging off one block.Overall, I would recommend this set to others and I also purchased additional sets as gifts.",
