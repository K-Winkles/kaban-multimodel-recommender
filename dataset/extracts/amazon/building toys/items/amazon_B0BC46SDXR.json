But mom said no more legos this year as he has so many already. So I found these. I had a similar set as a kid that only had the long straws and jack like connectors. This comes with smaller straws, more variety of connectors and even a plastic bin carrying case! This was his favorite gift and first toy played with... over video games!!! The look on his face when I told him all of the things I made and he realized just how much he could do (my favorites were the rocket ship and I'd make giant 3D fish).",

I am thrilled with not only the product but also the results. This toy has exceeded my expectations and has become an integral part of my daughter's therapy routine as well as everyday play. She thoroughly enjoys the hands-on nature and has shown remarkable progress in finger strength, dexterity, and coordination. Our home sessions have helped her refine her grasp and enhance her ability to manipulate small objects with precision. She no longer fights me when the \u201cfrustration factor\u201d kicks in because she is too excited to continue building and creating with her colorful straws and connectors. The open-ended nature of the toys sparks her creativity and imagination, making the sessions both productive and entertaining. She particularly enjoys modeling - I build something, and then she repeats it. I have gradually increased the difficulty level and provided age-appropriate challenges. Straw construction has benefited my daughter and has become an activity we can enjoy together at home as a family.Additionally, I bought two extra sets because as a family of four our creations were getting more innovative. They arrived at our office and one of my teammates became interested and started building something. A patient (we work at a dental office) jumped in and started playing with them too. It seems that putting something in dental phobics' hands relaxes them by engaging their mind. Win! We have put a big tub in the waiting room, and frankly, I am impressed by the soothing nature. We have been proudly \"gifted\" flower, cars, puppies made out of straws. Many have asked where we have bought them, and we proudly say Amazon!",
