The strength of the magnets was sufficient for building. I gave this set to a 9 year old refugee and he and his family were enthralled with them. To me the magnetic tiles (as long as they are built with quality) are a no-brainer gift for children from 2-20. I teach preschool to 3-5 year olds and magnetic tiles are one of the most popular toys over the years. This brand looked like it would hold up well too. Average size and no opaque pieces.",
