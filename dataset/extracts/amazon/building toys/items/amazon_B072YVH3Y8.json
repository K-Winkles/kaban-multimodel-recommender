As a building set, it has infinite possibilities for educational play and the kids AND adults in our household just couldn't put it down. We just wanted more pieces to build bigger and better things because we were having so much fun.But when I looked into buying another set, I discovered they cost about $25 per set. I saw this set and worried the quality wouldn't live up to the set we already owned, but I decided to try them out. THESE ARE WONDERFUL!!! I can't tell them apart from the other set and they were SO, SO much less expensive.I'm buying at least two more of these sets because we're thrilled with the purchase!",

He will spend over an hour at a time with this set, building and exploring new ways to put the parts together. I can see him learning as he plays. It is both fun and educational and gives me some quiet time that I can feel good about. Great for dexterity, imagination, trial and error and planning skills. I need another set or two because he sometimes doesn't want to break down a toy to build another. But can make several things at once with just one set. Would buy more sets if the price came back down again but the price has been increasing even though it is still listed as on sale.",

                "reviewText": "My 4-yr-old plays with this set daily. We ended up getting a second set so he can build more things and play with them together. Nice that this set comes with 2 screwdrivers/socket wrenches for playing with a friend. Also, I counted and there were actually 110 pieces, so that's nice. There are things with the toy itself that could be improved--like making the screws longer so that they can connect more than two pieces, or making the cubes and longer to accommodate a wheel in each side (as it is, they're pretty useless).",

Due to some circumstances, the set never went to my nephew but remained with me, unopened and unused until my toddler found the container. To my disappointment, when we opened the package in 2022 all of the nuts were missing, so we could not effectively build most items shown in the construction booklet/guide. I reached out to the company and explain what had happened and they very generously replaced the entire set. (One and a half years later!!) I am so impressed with with their level of service and understanding. I hope to purchase from them again. If you are on the fence about buying this set, go for it! it's been so much fun to build and bond with my baby.",
