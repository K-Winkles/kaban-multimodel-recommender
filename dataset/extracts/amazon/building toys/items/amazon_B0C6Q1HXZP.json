                "reviewText": "This was an amazing gift for my kids. They love building with them and can make all kinds of awesome things. My kids are pretty rough too, and so far we've only had a single broken piece since Christmas, and even that piece didn't break all the way, only cracked a little. They are also compatible with most brands of those big lego-style blocks! That's pretty convenient.The only two things I'd mention:1) the pieces are pretty small, so a potential choking hazard if you have kids who put stuff in their mouths.2) If you have two kids or more, consider buying two sets! More complex builds obviously require more pieces, and the pieces can get used up fast between multiple kids. Two sets will cut the bickering over pieces in half.",
