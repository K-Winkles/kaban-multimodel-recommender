                "reviewText": "The screws are ridiculously small. Even as an adult with decent dexterity it\u2019s hard for me to handle those. I had to use tweezers. Then once I got it built it burned my son\u2019s hand! After running for a few mins it got hot to the touch and actually started smoking. Photos of the melted parts are attached. Very cheap materials used which I get I didn\u2019t pay much for the entire kit but I\u2019d like for it not to melt and burn. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "This STEM Science Technology Engineering & Math Robotics Kit should be fun for kids and their parents. This kind of kit is something that the family can do as a project to teach one\u2019s children how to figure things out. There are clearly enough motors, gears, parts galore along with loads of fiber optics and colored lights to build so many different devices, toys and practical devices. The limit here lies more the one\u2019s imagination than anything else. This may be one of the more stimulating kits that I have seen on Amazon for the money. This STEM project Kit will keep young hands and minds active for quite a long time.If your child is doing well with Legos and can follow instructions, then this is an obvious next step for them. It will take some adults help every now and then to help them understand what + and \u2013 is on a battery and not to connect wires, batteries, and motors for the robots. This kit will stimulate their desire to learn more, if encouraged. The parent will need to be the judge as to what age to connect the child with this kit. I would certainly follow the ages on the box and know your own child. Should be fun for the child and parent alike. Five Stars for the price and potential of the learning in the box.",

                "reviewText": "I order a different set of these and built them with my 4 year old daughter and we had such a great time that I decided to order this set as well! I found these kits well designed. I wish that the wires came pre-soldered to the motors. The directions don't mention that you will need one, but you will. I had no issues with soldering all the motors, but not everyone knows how and I would have preferred that I came that way out of the box. If you don't know how to use a soldering iron, I would look for a different kit. That being said, these are super fun to put together with your children and are affordable.",
