The directions were pretty self explanatory but the age range should be at 7 or close to 8 years old vs 6 year olds. The parts are too small. If your child is crafty like mine is, it\u2019s easy to assemble but if your child just like the toys itself and not the act of putting them together than a parent is required. Overall the product is great for its price point. It\u2019s very hard to find these singing monsters anywhere else but online.",
