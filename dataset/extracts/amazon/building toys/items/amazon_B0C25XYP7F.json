                "reviewText": "My son loves \"building\" toys and STEM toys in general. He did like this one as well but overall judging from his interest levels not as much as others that are more attractive (like spaceships, etc). I guess because this one in contrast appears a bit drab since it just has bridges. But engineering is like that as well :). It probably combines well with other toys from this manufacturer. The toy itself is well-made and has bright colors. The instruction cards are not much to speak of with just a picture but that was enough for my son (who is 5) to build several of the models. I like that it has a picture of an actual bridge of the type that they will build. I'm not a civil engineer but I think some of the mechanics of attaching the pieces are also \"scientific\" in the sense they have something similar to the real-world building of that bridge. I think overall this is a different but nice set to have in a kid's collection. Most other building toys are cities or space ships or buildings.",

                "reviewText": "Overall I think that this is a fun building set and is great to mix it up and do something different than typical building sets that I have seen. I like that there are different cards with different things you can build, and you can also just ad-lib it and make your own creation. The backsides of the cards also have other languages. My almost 4 year old and I had fun with it for a little while until she said it was boring and she didn't want to play anymore, lol. I don't think this kit is boring (I had fun with it), but I do think that she is too young to really get the point of it and to enjoy it to its full extent. It says for ages 5+ and I'd say that for the average kiddo they should be at least 5 for this.My only issue is that the large square pieces are super hard to snap together and to pull apart. In addition to that, it seems to be straining the female connectors on the pieces when they are going together and coming apart and I wonder if there will be any issues over time when they are put together and pulled apart enough times. On the other hand, you don't have to worry about them falling apart when you have your structures together.",
