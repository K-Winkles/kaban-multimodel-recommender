                "reviewText": "I got this because my son has been loving putting things together to play with lately. When it arrived I was a little nervous because the box was so small. I was thinking that it was going to be thin and really breakable. When I got the box open it was actually a good size in thickness and everything. There is a screw driver, screws and even stickers to put on when done. It was fairly simple for him to do with some help and he uses it everyday.",

                "reviewText": "Got this for my 5-year-old son who loves building projects and toy vehicles. We had previously done a similar DIY wooden monster truck and it was such a fun project to do together - I was excited to find the car version. The kit was complete, it came with the wooden pieces, screws, a little screwdriver, and stickers for decoration. The instructions seemed straightforward and the assembly was fairly easy. My son did need some help lining up the screws and doing the last bit of tightening of the screws but otherwise managed to do most of it himself.For some reason though, it didn't quite come together the way I think it was supposed to... once everything was together I realized that the center body of the car was lower than the sides. It still looks good; we honestly didn't even notice it was different from the picture until we went to put on the stickers and realized that the longer ones didn't quite fit since the hood and back of the car are not totally flat. I suppose we could disassemble it and see if there is another way to put it together, but we followed the pre-drilled holes so I'm not sure if it will make a difference. It's not a huge issue as my son is still having a blast playing with it and it still rolls nicely.",

                "reviewText": "The concept is sound. The age suggestion is appropriate. The quality control is poor. There is nothing more frustrating than getting a kid excited about a project and the kit being flawed. I was missing a part. Fortunately I could make a replacement at the time it was being constructed. But this kit is also made of three parts that are all supposed to fit flush with each other. They did not. The screwdriver provided works, barely. The handle is to small for proper leverage. The stickers are not strong enough to stay stuck to bare wood. If i did not have access to my shop this project would have been dissatisfying.",

I would recommend to others for hands on activities for their little ones, nothing beats the feeling of accomplishment once they\u2019ve constructed their very own toy. \ud83c\udfce\ufe0f this would also make a great gift to any little builder or car lover.",

The kit includes everything needed: wooden parts, screws, mini screwdriver, and stickers. Everything went together nicely, although some screws were a bit difficult for my son to put in (not enough strength to turn the screws). The car is made from a lightweight solid wood and the wheels still turn. Overall, a nice kit for a child wanting to learn how to build a model.",
