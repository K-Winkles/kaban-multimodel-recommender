I ordered this for a three year old enamoured of dinosaurs. He was completely smitten with the box and just couldn't wait until Papa could help build. Probably few three year old kids could make the dinos by themselves. But the kid was engrossed in the process and used the battery operated screwdriver to set each screw. Papa helped to get the screws started. The dinosaurs are sturdy and the little boy has played with them a lot. I hid the screwdriver. Without papa's help, I don't think I can put them back together...",

We made the first 2 together, I lined up the screws while he used the drill to secure the parts. It was great fun. The downside is when it came to assembling the TRex, there were several parts missing including the head so it has no eyes and it looks like a crocodile. I think it would be value for money if all the parts were there and now looking at other reviews this was a problem for a few too. I haven't been able to see how to contact the seller to replace this one Dino without sending it all back.",
