They attach with no problem the only slight difference is the taller triangle is about an eighth of an inch taller but they still stick to Magna tiles. The magnets on this set are actually stronger. The letter blocks snap into the window tile with no problem. Even our 3 year old granddaughtercan do it. She and her 5 1/2 year old sister love them. I highly recommend them as they are very durable. This set set is definitely worth the money and is something they won\u2019t get tired of playing with for a long time. Really encourages imagination in building on STEM skills.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Excellent buy!!! All my kiddos are teens to adults (explains the video my girls testing out the blocks pre-party) but I bought these to have on hand for when little ones come to visit & for a party we were having, I didn\u2019t want to invest too much but I still wanted them to be of good quality and after reading reviews on many different sets I decided on these ones and they were a definite great buy, honestly it kept all ages entertained from the little ones to even my adult kiddos! I had parents asking where I purchased because apparently the name brand set goes for $100+ Be mindful I\u2019ve never felt the name brand so I don\u2019t know what to compare them to but as far as magnet strength they were awesome, I will be a 100% honest as the plastic does feel a little lightweight but regardless I know they use pretty heavy duty magnets because my girls built some pretty large structures and they held up pretty well. These were such a hit and such a great price I\u2019m strongly thinking about purchasing another set!",
