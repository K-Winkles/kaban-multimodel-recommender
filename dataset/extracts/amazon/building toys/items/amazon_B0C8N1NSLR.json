We've got this hung on a wall alongside some other builds we've done together and it just looks great. Instructions were lacking, but since its a smaller build it was easy to get around that. Nothing super difficult to build and does look awesome. I really like that they added chromed out parts that are shiny instead of just bland black or grey as a substitute. Props to the designers for that for sure.",

But once you get past the first few pages it gets easier.It looks good in the end and I found it a very satisifying set.I did laugh though at the inclusion of a standard lego man, who is completely the wrong size for this bike.While building this I thought this bike could use a little crackle, as certain parts when trying to insert other parts would constantly come off.Love blocks, would do it again.",

                "reviewText": "For an off-brand brick building kit, it's okay, but I did run into a number of issues during assembly:- The bags are not numbered or labelled in order, so you must dump out all the packs and find parts across baggies. Knolling your parts is super important at the start!- The quality of the plastic isn't exceptional, with a lot of loose connections and one of the clear tail-light pieces even shattered on me while being put on- The instructions can be very unclear; there are many steps with lots of pieces all listed going on at once, and poor camera angles are chosen to help orient the parts-The overall design of this model is a little fragile, with many joints having just a single brick holding parts together, allowing a lot of wobble, rotation, and falling apart mid-construction.-The booklet instructs you to add your stickers at awkward points in the construction, many steps after the bricks that need the decals have been assembled into the whole build, which makes it much harder to apply the stickers than if you'd been warned to add the sticker when the brick is first introducedThe final model is nice, and it's a reasonably affordable kit for the number of pieces, but you do feel where those cost savings have been made in the build.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this motorcycle because I was wanting a different vehicle and this one appeared nice.This motorcycle set is about 310 pieces. It comes in 5 small bags. The motorcycle also has a minifig \"rider\".This set is fairly easy to build. The instructions are written fairly well, just need a good light. All new pieces are highlighted which makes it easier to know where they go. Only a couple pieces were not so obvious.This motorcycle only takes about 7 or 8 inches (estimated). The listing at the time I ordered is not great, only a little less than the big \"L\" brand and that one is bigger.The following cons are not that big of a deal but need to be mentioned.Some of the pieces were extremely difficult to put together. While most were mushy, there were some that almost did not fit.Some of the parts are a bit loose, not so much where the motorcycle comes apart easily but loose enough where I had to put them back on during the assembly.The front wheel moves easily. During assembly, everytime I pushed down or was puttting anothwr part on, the front wheel would go out further away from the main body. I had to reposition the wheel and fork assembly a lot.The handlebars do not look that nice. These parts just seemed to be thrown in to create the handlebars making them not appear as nice as the rest of the bike.I do like this motorcycle kit and will recommend this set. If you can find the Big \"L\" brand, get that one also. At the time of this review, I was able to find the big \"L\" brand for almost twice as much as this one and is a little more than twice the size. For this generic brand, it really does look good.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a fairly intelligent man. However, deciphering the picture instructions takes a lot of time. I currently am on bed rest, so fortunately I have plenty of that right now lol. However, I can see people getting very impatient with it. Parts are good quality and the limited pieces I've put together so far fit well. Instruction booklet is also printed well, but again, could use more steps to describe in more detail how some pieces fit in.Overall, I would not recommend. The design is ambitious, however some of the major components are attached go the main body with only one or two studs. This makes it extremely difficult to put on finishing touches because the build falls apart and you have to go back in the instructions to figure out how it went together.I seem to be missing a piece, and also have 3 leftover pieces, which could be from me missing where they go due to the poor instructions. For the longest time I was stuck on step 4 or 5 because the pre-install instructions for a piece didnt match up with how the instructions displayed the pieces fitting together, so I had to make it up and it seemed to work. Also, the minifig is pointless as it is a completely different scale than the motorcycle.There is no way a 6 year old could assemble this. It would likely be faster and easier to put an actual motorcycle together. Invest in a different building block set. Unless if you REALLY like motorcycles and building block sets, and have a BUNCH of time, patience, and skill, this isn't the set for you.",
