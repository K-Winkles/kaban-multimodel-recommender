Easy to follow, just be careful of the slightly different parts (instructions will warn you). Came with some spare tiny pieces which drove me nuts for a sec but guess they threw them in to avoid dropping those really important pieces (some slipped from my hand often). I didn't expect the wings to be a rubber material, so it might attract pet hair but I'm overall glad I got this for a steal of a price!",
