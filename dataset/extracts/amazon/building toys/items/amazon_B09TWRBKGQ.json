                "reviewText": "This car model states 6+ on the box, which seems fairly accurate. HOWEVER, even though there aren\u2019t too many pieces... not a single one of the packs are labeled. You likely will need to help younger kids with this kit. Kids older than 8 may get bored easily until it\u2019s ready to drive. The whole bottom frame is already together so your child only has to build up from the frame. WARNING: The stickers are super sticky, use caution when opening the kit. The stickers were stuck to the inside top of the box and wrinkled (see picture).The positives: If you have a kid that can\u2019t seem to stay on task for very long\u2026. this is a good purchase. The pieces seem like quality plastic and the stickers won\u2019t peel off once placed.For the price I would have expected the packs to be labeled and the stickers to be packed in a way you can't wreck them before you even use them.",
