                "reviewText": "Our son has loved these building toys. The case that they come in is super helpful too in keeping everything organized and keep pieces from getting lost.The pieces all feel really durable and are easy to assemble, especially for little hands.My one critique is that the building ideas that come in the instructions are not very clear. My husband and I have had to study them to try to figure out how to build certain things. Obviously, we don\u2019t have to build them just like the pictures, but comparing it to instruction books for other toys, this one lacks a little clarity. It doesn\u2019t keep my son from playing and loving this though, so I would definitely recommend it!",
