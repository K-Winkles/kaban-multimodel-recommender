We have tried to find a building kit that would challenge him and keep his interest for more than a few minutes. The \"PicassoTiles PTT136 136pcs Tubular Pipes & Spout\" have been the answer. He LOVES these and has played with them every day for the last 2 months. He builds anything his imagination thinks of. The first thing he built was a diesel truck with dual smoke stacks and a flatbed. The pieces in this set have been very well planned. There hasn't been a single frustration because each piece was made for a child's imagination. He has built trumpets, lasers, harps, light sabers and much more. This was money very well spent. We are all of us very pleased with this set!",

I love that it\u2019s open ended play and truly lets kids be creative. I will say, the horn piece is loud! But still so fun if you\u2019re okay with that. My kids have loved everything we\u2019ve ordered from Picasso, and these are no exception.",
