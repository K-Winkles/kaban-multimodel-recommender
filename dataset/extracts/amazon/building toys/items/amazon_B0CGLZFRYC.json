                "reviewText": "There's a lot of pieces here. We made a space fighter craft and still had almost half the pieces left over. We crafted it by just grabbing whatever piece happened to be handy. I think if we had put more thought and effort into matching the colors, it would've looked better, but we liked the end result.The pieces hold together well, it made a sturdy fighter craft that didn't fall apart when playing with it. It did break apart when it was thrown, but I didn't really expect it to hold together with rough play.The set comes with a storage bag that would actually hold a few more pieces than were included in the set, so it's not too full when you put the pieces away.None of the pieces were deformed or broken. I don't think they would break under normal play, but if you stepped on one it might deform and become unusable.All in all, I think this would make a good toy for any child old enough to not try to eat the pieces. You can make many things with it. We're going to try making a castle next.The only thing I don't like is that all the pieces are the same shape. I wish there were some that were just one block, and some that were three in a row, for making the nose of the ship pointier, but I knew when I got this, all the pieces were the same so I can't fault the manufacturer for that. But it would make the set a bit nicer to have a few more options available. Still I give it 5 stars for being a good toy to keep us occupied for hours at a time.",
