                "reviewText": "I bought this toy for my 3 (nearly 4) year old daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. It does have small pieces that a child will need to be old enough to know not to put in their mouth, and also how to keep them contained and not lose them. The pieces all fit inside the box provided; but we ended up using a Tupperware box with a lid, and I added my own cardboard dividers to keep the pieces separate as opposed to using the carrying box, so it doesn\u2019t have to be continuously opened or otherwise dumped out to be played with. It features different difficulty levels of play with the easiest being the paper pictures with holes and the button type push ins; a level up would be working with screws and tools, and then attempting to build flat 2D pictures with the shapes on a blank background, or using the booklet provided to build 3D creations being the most difficult. The toy doesn\u2019t come with enough nuts for all the screws and I think it should have more of these both. Otherwise my daughter wants to play with it all the time. She packs it up to take to her papa\u2019s house and enjoys making different patterns on the board. By far her favorite gift; she even likes it better than her dollhouse I got her the year prior.",

                "reviewText": "This 244 piece electric screwdriver kit is Terrific. My grandson spends hours screwing pieces onto the case it comes with. Everything fits inside the case when finished. We put the pieces in a bowl and let him built on the case. It has holes the screws fit into. He loves the electric \"battery operated\" screwdriver. He can now change the manual screwdriver from Phillips to a straight head or a nut driver. This has been great for his fine motor skills. Thanks for such a great toy!",

For a boy who loves to do it himself and work with tools, this gift beat all others.I would have purchased it for my daughter if she was younger too.",
