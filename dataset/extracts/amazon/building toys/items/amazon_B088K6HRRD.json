                "reviewText": "Being a stay at home mom, I constantly try to find different things for my toddler to do. We have a gazillion different art drawing boards. It was time we find something other than drawing. This set was my great find. The pieces are very nice quality. It\u2019s a very entertaining and educational activity for my kid to build these flowers. They are also beautiful. I can use them as decorations. It also came with a travel tote bag which was great for storing and pieces. I totally will buy this set as gifts for other toddlers.",

Cute and just as colorful and bright as a really garden. The box pictures don't do it justice. Was fun building with our 5 year old on a rainy day when we couldn't play in the real garden this was a great alternative that we will definitely have many more rainy days of entertainment.",
