Between these...and the four other boxes I bought of different colors here on Amazon from other companies-I believe we actually have enough to play with and build structures with now. The main picture on here is really misleading, because you would likely need $200 worth of blocks to build that. Don't do that sellers!",

The materials and everything feel like they are high quality. The magnets are also nice and strong, but easy enough for kids to take apart. A lot of fun, definitely recommend for kids.",

                "reviewText": "EDIT** Again I just want to say how amazing these blocks are. We visited my grandson who is almost 3, and he took these blocks with him everywhere. The little bag that was included helped him carry them. Being as they are magnetic they are easy to keep together and for him to build without blocks falling everywhere- especially in a restaurant, where keeping a toddler entertained is sometimes impossible. But we would take these blocks and he was always happy and there was never a huge mess. They are also lightweight, so they are quiet. I\u2019m buying another set so he can add onto his block building!!Original Post: We bought this for our grandson who is obsessed with blocks. These are a great size to hold and play with for a toddler. They seem to be very sturdy and the magnets connect well. The colors are bright and colorful and he loves to play with them. He can just sit there and play for hours. Definitely recommended!!!",
