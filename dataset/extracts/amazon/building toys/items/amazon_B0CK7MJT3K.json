                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Something a Little Different, Lots of Fun",
                "reviewText": "The directions say \"Ages 3 and up.\" Which is fine, but I'm afraid that many grownups are going to think that means \"For Three Year Olds.\" And that would be a shame. I could see my older grandsons enjoying this just as much. Maybe not the 10 year old, who prefers more complex projects, but definitely the 8 year old. Maybe the label should read \"For ages 3 - 8.\"I opened the box which was roughly the size of a shoebox, to find it brim full of colorful pieces. The first thing I bet most preschoolers will do is to make a long, tall tower. They'll stack every piece possible just one-piece wide and as long as they can. Great! Encourage them. Can they make is as tall as they are? Sure! As tall is Grandma? Maybe as tall as the room? And that might be all the child wants to play with it on the first day.I like to shake the pieces out of their original container and put them in a large dishpan - preferably one with a lid. It was hard for me to dig through the toy bin it came in to find just the right piece I wanted without spilling other pieces on the floor. Putting the toys into a larger bin will make searching for the right piece much easier. On a side note, there are only just exactly enough pieces in the box for one child. If you have two or more children, buy an extra set. It's just not fun to play with a small set of blocks - it limits the child's imagination. I think it's better to have a really large collection of one or two types of building toys, than to have every kind of building toy imaginable but only in small numbers.I built a dune buggy out of the blocks looking at the idea book. There are three of the bigger wheels and three of the smaller wheels. If you get two sets, they'll all match up. With a single set, you have to put smaller wheels in front of any vehicle and larger wheels in the back. I think this is a mistake. There should be four small wheels, or four large wheels. Three wheels is just nonsense. But the idea book shows using the wheels more for decorations, for the tops of buildings and not just as wheels for a car.The blocks go together super easily, and they come apart easily too. That can be great for small hands, but it could be frustrating, too. My dune buggy came apart several times while making it. But eventually I got it together.These pipes could be a lot of fun, but I don't think they'll be the favorite toy in the box. They're fun for something different. I'd probably keep them out of reach and bring them out once in a while - so they're something interesting and new on rainy days or when the children seem especially fractious. I find that if I leave too many toys out, the children can't seem to make up their minds what they want to play, and they instead play the annoying game of \"let's dump all the pieces of all the toys out into a big pile and then scatter them around the house.\" So I only leave out as many toys as the child can easily pick up by himself in under an hour. More than that is too many.So, I give this STEM building toy for kids ages 3 - 8 five stars!And in case some of you don't know what STEM means, it's an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, Math. STEM toys are supposed to encourage children in those four areas. Any building toy is good for engineering, science, tech, etc. Building a tower that balances without toppling is engineering. Building a tower as tall as you are is math. Building a tower with balconies and buttresses builds on technology. Knowing what happens when you kick the tower down is science. It's all good. The child could build a tower out of straws and it's still a STEM toy.",

As a little mind and cognitive ability continue- these are perfectly used to create objects or design abstract ideas.. The options are endless. This moves seamlessly into an ability to mix and incorporate with other types of play.. littles can create a city or make road for hot wheels\u2026 create a zoo out of these for tiny plastic animals etc. But, it doesn\u2019t stop there!! This could be a set to help with a school science project as a child will be tasked with in the future- SEE, THIS SET GROWS WITH YOU!!!Set is a shoe box size filled tightly with a variety of so many parts and pieces- includes carry bag for use \u201con the go..\u201d this makes it ideal for travel. I emptied set into a larger bin making it far easier to gain access and have a visual of choices.. it\u2019s also far easier on cleanup- no need to Tetris fit back into box! (Simply store carry bag inside as well.. too perf!) this type storage will allow me to add more along the way.Solid option that could last thru child rearing years.. set is unisex and fun for boy/girls alike. Love more than x1 can play at a time and easy to keep clean. Solid robust pieces have longevity about them- A great addition to preschool or daycare. Make a fun gift for any.. Hoping info can help- stay safe everyone.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the \"Stem Building Toy for Toddlers Tube Pipe Toy Educational Preschool Toys for 3+ Years,\" currently selling for $25. I broke these out for the grandkids thinking it would provide hours of fun, but they tired of them in a matter of minutes. There are limited shapes making building options simple and limited. Nothing like the versatility of something like tinker toys. They are a good size for the little hands of toddlers, and they were immediately drawn to the colors, but the value just is not there. The two-year-old did have fun making a snake by putting them together in one long line after the other kids tired of them.",
