                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. If you have a ball at every intersection and build from the bottom up and don't try to move the structure, the toy will be great. The magnets are strong enough for that type of play.If you want to be able to pick up your structures or spin them in the air or anything like that, it's going to be frusating. Or, if a child has poor motor skills, they might get frustrated by accidentally bumping and breaking shapes.Also worth noting, stick-to-stick connections will break from basically anything, but stick-to-ball connections are much better (still not great).I haven't tried other brands to know if this is better/worse than a different option.The color selection is clearly advertised as being random, but it was still disappointing to have 0 green straight rods and 0 blue curved pieces and 0 short red pieces. I just expected \"random\" to have a more spread-out representation of the colors.I have some normal kitchen scissors in my photos. Obviously those aren't included, but I left them there for a size reference.",

The diagrams of possible projects are great \"cheat-sheets\". The visuals are easy to duplicate and a great way to test the little ones' attention to detail. She loved to point to the project she wanted us to work on. It's wonderful to allow children to boss adults around for a change! This toy gives children a real sense of producing something to be proud about, especially after it's all done and you clap and smile with them!",

                "reviewText": "I bought two sets of these and almost returned them based on the broken English on the box (\"many modelling\"=many possible models, \"Strong Magnetic\"= Strong Magnets, etc.) and that alone made me hesitate to give these as a gift. But, I bought them for my 5 year old daughter's birthday because she loves magnets, and I'm so glad I didn't return them. The magnets are strong enough, the pieces are chunky and easy to handle, nothing breaks when they fall from the table to the floor. With the 2 sets I bought, there are so many things my kids can build with these, from 3D houses to simple letters and shapes. A lot of magnet toys are tiny so it's hard to build something impressive quickly, but these are big enough to do the trick and just fun to pay with. Inexpensive for the level of quality, too!",
