He always wanted to have a set so he could play with his grandsons. it warms my heart to see him sitting and playing with them and even introduced his older items into the set. The Lincoln logs come in a very sturdy tin, so easily cleaned up. The items are well sanded and not sharp. Thank you.",

The packaging is great- a huge tin we could use for many purposes. The tin is not however made for the lincoln logs set packaged in it-5 of those could fit inside. Yes it has 100 and whatever pieces as in the labelling but mostly the small corners pieces, leaving not many possibilities for creative building (not many long pieces for walls or enough roof). It was so overpriced and my daughter is so uninterested. It was my worst Christmas purchase by far.",
