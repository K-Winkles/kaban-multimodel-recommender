He's now 23 months and we had to buy another set to help replenish some of what we lost (not to wear or tear, the blocks just literally disappeared in the house). He plays with them every day and he enjoys stacking them, throwing them, gnawing on them and lining them up on the window sill. This was one of the best purchases I've made for him because they've brought him so much joy. They're easy to wipe down. The only negative thing I can think of is that they don't always stack vertically well, some of the blocks just won't stay together.",

                "reviewText": "Things I was worried about when choosing between similar listings: size of the blocks, # included, smell and quality/feel. I bought these for a 7 month old so she mostly chews on them and bangs them together but if you build her a tower she'll knock it down. I wasn't sure about the interlocking shapes because I was worried they would make it hard to stack them traditionally but only one side protrudes so you can easily avoid using that side. They help my kids play with their baby sister longer because they're interested in interlocking all of the pieces before she knocks the tower down. Most sets were 10 blocks so this has more. Each block is a good size and they feel nice and heavy and they don't smell. They are soft enough to squeeze a bit and they make a soft squeak sound. The colors are beautiful. The numbers and images to count and learn aren't as easy to see because they are the same color but I wouldn't want them any other way because it would ruin the aesthetic. If I've got to have all these things laying around my house for the next few years I might as well like the way they look. They came in a nice little box that would be easy to wrap and gift.",

                "reviewText": "Let me preface this review by saying I'm the wife of this account holder, so pardon if I come across a bit overdramatic about mere children's blocks. First of all, the packaging was gorgeous. The blocks come in a neat and attractive little box (won't bother to put a picture since other users already have). The blocks themselves are sooo cute! The colours are easy on the eyes and have a good mix (greens, pinks, blues, beiges). They are easy to clean and can be used in the bath. They are multifaceted: teething, building, counting, squeaking, floating in the tub, etc.My baby loves them (mainly he just smashes two of them together and laughs). I would recommend these to other mums or even buy them as a gift for another child since they are so well-packaged and high-quality. Okay, enough praise. I think you get it.",

                "reviewText": "These are perfect for encouraging fine motor skills.My 8 month old baby loves these. She chews on it with all of her 2 1/2 teeth she has. She shakes it and hits it against other toys and wall to make different sounds. She also uses her finger to touch little details on the embossed pictures on the cube.The squeaky noise is not loud at all.These are soft cubes; however, if you knock on them, you will hear knocking sound somewhat like wood. So they are not like super soft rubber or baby bottle nipple.Some of the animals and shape names on the cubes that might be helpful to know are:1- mouse / qautrefoil (/kad\u0259rfoil/)]2- cow / hexagon3- square / tiger4- triangle / rabbit5- circle / dragon6- uh.. circle sector? / snake7- star / horse8- heart / lamb9- cross (suppose to be an addition sign) / monkey0- bar (supposed to be a subtraction sign) / chickenSmall addition sign - flower / dogSmall subtraction sign - trapezoid / pig** the 12 animals match all Chinese zodiac signs so it must be that. Might be fun to find out which one your baby is. :P",
