It\u2019ll keep your toddler busy in any places you go. It can be in a flight, a restaurant, at a picnic or just being at home. It will keep you and your toddler busy creating and building things. Definitely a great gift to give.",

Unfortunately no. These are small magnet balls in the corners. Noisy and weaker then our tiles. Wish these were higher quality. The kids don\u2019t mind which is what is important",
