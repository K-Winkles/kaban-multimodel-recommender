                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This was a fun build that took about 4 hours of relaxed building time to complete. There were a few frustrations, mostly dealing with the sails and the main mast.The main mast has a spot where the crow's nest connects to the mast piece and it just doesn't want to stay together when installing the sails onto the piece. This was made more complex because I mistakenly grabbed the top sail instead of the bottom one to install on the bottom crossbar, but it still gave me trouble even when I fixed my mistake. The two sails don't rest far enough apart from each other to make the installation easy, as they sort of push and pull on each other.The back sail was confusing because the picture in the book shows it in the opposite direction of how it should be installed and I finally had a random thought flash through my mind at the end of the build about switching it from upside down to right side up (upside down, it covers a lot of the captain's wheel, which is what triggered my thought of switching it).The front sail was actually the easiest, maybe in part to being the last one installed, but had one tricky part--the cord that is strung from the front of the ship to the back is fastened by being pinched between a peg and its hole. The front was easy enough, but the back was between a hole and a smaller \"peg\" that's also the end of a chain. I simply tied the string in the back to get it to hold instead of trying to get it successfully pinched in.The fun surprise is figuring out that the cannons actually fired, although very weakly. They do fire a little better when they're being held down and can't move as easily as in my video, but it's still a maximum range of 12-18 inches.Overall, I did enjoy this build. It was relaxing and fun, except for those stubborn sails. I'm glad I got it to add to my collection.",

                "reviewText": "First off, not being compatible with Lego sucks. If you aren't going for a mini set, there is no reason to not make things cross compatible. This gets a ding just for that, because any child or adult you gift it to is ultimately going to be disappointed.However, the box it comes in is very Lego-like. The instructions are bright, colourful, and some of the better third-party instructions I've seen. They come as a large booklet. However, the packaging isn't perfect, the booklet came pretty bent, and the stickers came almost unusable, thrown in loose and banged around until they were actually coming off the backing when I opened the box, and do not lay flat. Not ideal.The pieces themselves are ok. They are packaged in the standard numbered bags. The base pieces are quite sturdy.I'd have second thoughts about giving this as a gift. It is alright for a knock-off Lego set that is not-quite Pirates of the Caribbean, and an authentic set is going to be quite expensive, so it has that going for it.",

The box is hefty and there are tons of pieces in it (621). The pieces, though not Lego-branded or compatible, are very similar in shape and size, and appear to be of equivalent quality. All the pieces are in numbered bags to keep them organized. The instruction manual is detailed and very clear. And if the kids don't want to do it, I will do it by myself because it is so cool!",

They did a really good job, too, from the expressive characters to the creative detailing and set of the ship itself. It ends up being larger than you'd expect, and stands up to play quite well! The only thing missing is some of those smooth round pieces for the bottom (so it can \"glide\" along hard surfaces). Beyond that, they nailed all the details. Easy to follow instructions as well! Highly recommended!",
