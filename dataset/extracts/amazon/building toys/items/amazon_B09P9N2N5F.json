I love the moving parts and how you can attach others in the same series together to make one huge moving playground full of Pok\u00e9mon goodness. Not only that but the quality is fantastic with MEGA as well. They are just slightly different yet can still be used together with the Lego sets or other compatible brands. Now I can\u2019t wait for her birthday so we can play with the rest of the ones I got her. I\u2019m excited!!!",

I guess its a basic set so they didn't feel the need to make it look the best possible. I prefer the Pikachu in the Motion Pikachu build. Coconut tree is a nice touch, and the waves are lovely. I also like the bucket with the sand in it, makes for a nice beach scene. Would like this in a bigger build though.",
