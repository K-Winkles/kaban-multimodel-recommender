                "reviewText": "I bought this for my 6 year old daughter for Christmas and really enjoyed spending the time building it together. She liked finding all the pieces we needed and the steps were easy enough for her to follow. The instructions are pretty clear and as long as you are looking carefully at the details, the build goes very smoothly. My daughter also liked how the instruction booklet has a little line on the bottom of each page tracking how far you are progressing with each step. It took us a couple hours to build but we were taking our time and enjoying the process. It has also sparked an interest in cars for her which I love! The only downside was that sometimes the pieces you adding on don't have the most stable base so as you push down on one piece, something else easily pops off. Overall, a great little project and time spent together. Would highly recommend!",
