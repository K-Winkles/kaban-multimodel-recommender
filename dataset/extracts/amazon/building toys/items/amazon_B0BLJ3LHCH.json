The colors are bright, and the builds are fun yet simple enough for my kid to do mostly on their own. It\u2019s great seeing them get creative, mixing parts to make their own creatures. The quality is top-notch, typical of LEGO, and the instructions are clear. A little tricky for younger kids with the small pieces, but overall, an awesome set that keeps my child engaged for hours.
