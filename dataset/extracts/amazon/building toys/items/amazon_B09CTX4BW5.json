We had to help them to build the set as instructed the first time but then they assembled and disassembled them creating hybrids. I bought two sets from two different manufacturers. There was very little difference. This set didn't have little wheels underneath the feet but the difference didn't bother the kids in the least. I liked the screw drivers that were in this set. They were colorful and easy to handle. The kids never used the screw drivers. They only used the battery operated drills. It takes 2 AAA batteries. The pieces were interchangeable between the two sets. This sets dinosaurs were slightly larger, not significantly though. Great for increasing problem solving skills and small motor skills.",

There are a thousand pieces and there's no way they can stay entertained long enough to go through directions and put these together. My husband put them all together while my son tried to \"help\" by taking the screws and nearly losing all of them.It would be a long shot for even my 6 year old nephew to put these together without a lot of assistance. I would say these would be perfect for 8/9/10 year olds.",
