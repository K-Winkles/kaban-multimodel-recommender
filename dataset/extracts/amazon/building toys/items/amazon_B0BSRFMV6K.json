                "reviewText": "Really excited to see Sonic return to LEGO form with this new line of sets, especially his friends - I know a lot of people, myself included, have been wanting minifig Tails for a long time! The fox's workshop has a lot of detail for the size, with two work benches for all your (or your kid's) engineering needs, or simply to take care of the included Clucky (plus a small potted plant that Sonic X fans might recognize) One of the seven Chaos Emeralds, the yellow one, sits on the other bench for our heroes to study with the Miles Electric.Sonic's famous Tornado is also very well built for the scale. The biplane feels extremely sturdy and is pleasant to hold, and you can, of course, place Sonic and Tails in the cockpit or on the upper wing, just like in the games and movie.The smaller parts add to the experience, too: the Buzz Bomber, although somewhat flat, still performs its job as a Badnik well enough. A recliner and toolbox are also included, and there's even a few mint candies for Tails to enjoy - yet another reference for more well-versed fans.All in all, this set is really enjoyable to play with or display. Definitely a must-buy for any LEGO Sonic fans!",
