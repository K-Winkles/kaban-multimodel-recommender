                "reviewText": "Vanmor 300 Pieces Stem Building \"Rings\" can build some of the most interesting things you can't do with the other building \"blocks\". A paper comes in the box with the \"rings\" or blocks of things possible that can be built, and with a little practice you too will be able to build flowers, hats, stars, even a small bike for maybe an action figure or Barbie.The colors are bright and although there are toys similar to this, I haven't found a toy that is quite like it. Maybe I'm not shopping the right stores, I just think this is innovative.There is a learning curve I thought. These pop with a little work, but the kids seemed to take right to them and had all kinds of things built before I had mine halfway finished. I told them I meant to do it that way.The little littles (preschool) hands aren't as strong as the early elementary grade kids, so it was tougher task for them to get them connected and stay connected. With the help of the older littles everyone finished what they started.These blocks (rings) are a great way for the kids to use their imaginations and put down the electronics for a little while. I love STEM toys, always have. When you can add a little bit of learning while having a good time it's a winner in my book. Be creative, build your own thing, most of all have fun with it. At $15. it is a steal. I recommend it this toy, keep in mind there are 300 of these little things and can pose a choking hazard for little littles.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: - feels durable - pieces easy to attach/detach - by design, attached pieces can move, which offers a slight degree of flexibilityCon: - pieces easily fits into mouthsThese interlocking discs are uniquely-shaped and offer the following benefits: easy to manipulate, easy to connect and detach pieces, interlocked pieces are able to slightly pivot up/down or side-to-side (which means the longer your chain, the greater the flexibility), and you can attach pieces at nearly any angle. Each piece feels quite durable individually and the connection points should be reasonably durable with normal use. The bright colors and the interesting shapes will appeal to children.It does not take long for children to get a feel for what these interlocking discs are capable of. There are a few sample pictures included in the box, but if a child is having difficulty making curved shapes, an adult can sit next to the child and model forming different shapes (i.e. parallel play). This toy is perfect for open-ended play, but it also helps children learn about colors and patterns. Just keep in mind that these pieces can easily fit into a child\u2019s mouth, so supervision may be required.(Opinion) I would highly recommend the Vanmor 300 Pieces Interlocking Plastic Discs. This is a brightly-colored and uniquely-shaped toy that encourages open-ended exploration of colors, patterns, and balancing. Kids and adults will enjoy working with this toy. While this product is rated for ages 3+, you will want to use your best judgement as to whether children will try to put these pieces in their mouths.Great - 9.0",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE 2/25/2023: We counted the colors and pieces in this 300 piece set. There are only 275 total pieces - not 300! It is a tight fit for the 275 pieces and there is no way that the little container will hold 300 pieces. So I feel like this is misleading on the part of the manufacturer. Surely, we are not the only people to be shorted this amount. Also, there were only 7 purple pieces in the entire set.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~These are the Vanmor Interlocking Educational Building Blocks. These \"blocks\" come in a set of 300 and they also come with their very own plastic storage tote which is a bonus!I must confess....I got these for myself and my teenagers. Why should little kids have all the fun? These are cute and have bright colors. For me they make a good fidget style activity. We enjoy putting the pieces together and I like pulling them apart just as much.This set does come with a little colored page that has some design ideas. These are great for making a specific shape or even building by colors or just making different patterns. I think these are a great addition for any family.**I do want to express that these are NOT toddler friendly as they are small and could be a choking hazard for little ones. They measure smaller than 1 1/4 inches in diameter.",
