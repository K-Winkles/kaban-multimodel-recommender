I was so pleased to see that each instrument came in it's own little box which made them perfect for gift giving. Yes, the pieces are very tiny, but the effect was perfect! They were super entertaining simply because they were so tiny. Quality was not missing because of the size. The group had a wonderful time taking them home, putting them together (or having a younger person do it for them) and bringing them back to church and placing them one by one on the organ. I highly recommend. We have had so much fun with them.",

                "reviewText": "We got this set to add to a 'goodie' bag for my daughter's upcoming birthday gathering. We usually add a few fun things in a bag for the kids that join us and at less than $2 a set this looked like a nice option. The sets are very attractive and the kids enjoyed building them. I kept one for me and found it fun. :-) These are what is known as micro building block, so about 10%-20% the size of the larger name brand ones. Each set was around 100 pieces to build and included a decent number of extra pieces. The finished models are about 2\" tall and well detailed for the small size. The directions can be a little tricky as most steps are showing two phases of building and I needed to refer to the box image a couple times to make sure I was on track. That said, if the builder is familiar with Lego, Mega Bloks of any of the other name brand building block sets this should be doable. Out of a group of 5 kids, only one didn't enjoy them and she rarely builds block based models. All in all, this is a fun set to gift or just enjoy.",

The music set is more advanced, but the 5th graders and older can do them. 1st graders and older can do the animal sets.",
