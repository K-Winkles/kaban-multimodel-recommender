The age range is higher , but I just removed the smaller pieces and the rest is too large for her to put in her mouth. She plays with it constantly. She always picks the flowers from my garden so she loves that she has her own garden now. I would highly recommend as it is durable , great quality , fun and helps with coordination and imagination play.",

                "reviewText": "I have a set similar at school and love them so I bought these for some children that I work with outside of school hours. They had great fun playing with them about three feet from me and kept handing me bouquet after bouquet. Then they just played and were having a ball with them making all kinds of flower towers. I always count the pieces of a new toy when it is pick up time, so that the children get familiar and realize how full the New storage container should look when the toy's pieces are all in it; and I can make sure they all got picked up. [A new container because I can't get a toy back into it's original container/box so I know the kids can't.] I also check the original container to see how many pieces are suppose to be there. In this case the box showed the pieces and told exactly how many of each type of piece there was in the box. Which is a good thing as I will cut that off the box and put it in the new container so the kids can match what is going in the new container. I started counting and showing the kids how many they should have according to the original box and found out we had not received three of the flowers. The kids became upset and decided they couldn't play with it again as it is broke. So I have put it up for awhile and will remove the box cut out and see if they will play with it in a month or so. If not I will take them to school and put in with my other set. I like these and have used them for a number of years in my classroom, however, I don't think I would buy this brand again -- when I opened the box it was stuffed full and there was no way they would have gotten three more flowers in it. SO they need to either redo their packaging with the correct number of items that are actually in the box OR use a bigger box and put the correct amount of pieces in the box. I comparison shop and this set was the best price for the amount of pieces, only it isn't because three pieces were missing. I have not reached out to the company as it is always more of a hassle than to just be done with it.",
