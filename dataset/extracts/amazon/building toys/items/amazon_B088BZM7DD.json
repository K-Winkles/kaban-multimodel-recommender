One of the best kept secrets of transitioning to Lego from Duplo. We also added some basic gears to Lego just before starting with a basic GEARS kit.Hope other customers are as happy as our grandchild. And look on-line for design ideas, instructions etc.IF we had known, we would have started with GRAND-kids and skipped the Teen levels !",
