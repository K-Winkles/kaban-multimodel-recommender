                "reviewText": "Unsere Kinder (3 und 5) lieben die Kid Knex und bauen sehr gerne damit. J\u00fcngere Kinder konstruieren meist frei, aber ab 4/5 J k\u00f6nnen auf jeden Fall schon die ersten leichteren Bauwerke alleine nach Anleitung gebaut werden. Der Kreativit\u00e4t sind keine Grenzen gesetzt- leider nur durch die Anzahl der Teile, die durchaus mehr sein k\u00f6nnten. Die Anleitung (keine Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt) ist f\u00fcr mich ein gro\u00dfer Pluspunkt. Die verschiedenen Abbildungen fordern auch \u00e4ltere Kinder heraus und bieten zahlreiche Ideen und Vorschl\u00e4ge, damit es nicht langweilig wird. Das Material ist robust und f\u00fcr Kinderh\u00e4nde gut zu bedienen (Achtung: Stecker m\u00fcssen seitlich eingesteckt werden; sonst klappt es nicht). Wenn man den Dreh raus hat, ein vielseitiges Spielzeug, das mitw\u00e4chst.Wir sind begeistert und wundern uns, dass die Knex nicht schon bekannter sind.Absolute Empfehlung ab 3 Jahren und ein prima Geschenk!",
