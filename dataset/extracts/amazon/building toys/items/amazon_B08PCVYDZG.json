Bolts and screws are good size and easy to use with their little hands. Power tool is easy to use. One button to screw in and another to take the screw out. Easy to learn for my 2 and 3 year old boys. Construction of the Dino\u2019s is good. Not cheap plastic and they don\u2019t fall apart once you build them. Price was great on this product and helps keep the boys busy and working on the dexterity/hand-eye coordination!",

My son loves the little drill that came with it.Only issue we had was that it looks like during manufacturing one foot of one of the dinosaurs was missing a part. We emailed the customer service for the company that makes them and they sent us a new dinosaur the next day!",

                "reviewText": "Got these dinosaurs for my nephew a year ago but we didn't put them together until yesterday (he's 5 now). He loves doing projects together. I knew as we were building them I was going to be leaving a 5 star review. They're very well made with easy to understand instructions but can be put together without the instructions. They are actually adorable, not scary-looking like some toy dinosaurs can be. I like that they give you extra screws, a drill, and 3 screw drivers. This set would be great for siblings or for dinosaur themed parties. Each child gets what they need to build their own dinosaur, the activity of building them is great fun, and then they have a handmade party favor to take home with them. I suggest sorting/seperating everything by color and screw count before giving them to the kids. My nephew loved being the designated drill guy but used the screwdrivers as well. He needed help, as he's 5 but, he felt a part of it. He felt proud of himself when we had 3 dinosaurs that he made. We built all 3 one after the other and he didn't lose patience or get bored. Best part is he can take them apart and build them all over again, and without instructions for a challenge.These are great for kids who love to build/assemble and for kids who love dinosaurs. Great for adults too- I had fun!",
