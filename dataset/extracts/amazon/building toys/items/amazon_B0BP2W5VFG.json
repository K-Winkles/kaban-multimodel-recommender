                "reviewText": "I've assembled a lot of Lego sets. They're usually fun and stress free. This one was no different. The gimmicks from the movie were funny - there's a barbasol can, a spinning dock sign, and Nedry's face has an alternate \"venomized\" version. All great fun that captures that scene of the movie perfectly. It's a good looking set and captured the spirit of the scene perfectly. It took about 35 minutes to assemble. At the time of this review, the set costs $20. That's a great price for this set. Legos have become so insanely expensive that I would have expected this to be a $25 or $30 set, easily.If you're a hardcore collector, don't buy this set from Amazon. It came in an envelope and the box was very beat up. This didn't affect the product at all but for those of you that like to display packaging or keep the item boxed, you're better off going to a brick and mortar store and buying off the shelf. Product gets a 5/5, Amazon's shipping and delivery of product gets a 1/5.",

                "reviewText": "For $20 this LEGO set is worth it. Iconic scene from the movie.A quick little hack I did to make this better was use the red lever pieces as windshield wipers. You get one piece for the transmission lever inside the Jeep and another as an extra. I put them on the red fence piece that goes infront of the windshield. Fits the scene as it was pouring down when the jeep got stuck in the mud. It would\u2019ve been nice if the set came with a winch on the jeep though.I think the set could\u2019ve been better but for $20 it\u2019s a good deal.",
