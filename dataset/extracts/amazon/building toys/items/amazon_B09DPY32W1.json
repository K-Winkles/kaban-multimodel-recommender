Even after taking apart few times and rebuilding, still looks good. The powered screwdriver also helps the building process.Would definitely suggest buying this product.",

I can not call it a toy because you have to build them. Let them use their imagination, creating links in the brain to logic, deductive reasoning, learning to use tools. This project gave him a satisfaction of a job well done. Made of a heavy duty plastic they may have started out as t rex, brontosaurus and a triceratops but we have new species running around.",

She had so much fun helping and once they were together her and her sister have been none stop playing with them for a week. I tightened them down pretty good so neither of them will be able to get them apart on their own. Once my 2 year old is better with keeping small parts out of her mouth I'll loosen them up and watch my kids take them apart and put them back together on there own.",
