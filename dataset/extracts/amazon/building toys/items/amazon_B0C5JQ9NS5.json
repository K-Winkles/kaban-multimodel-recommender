Most recently, he took an object, a hammer, and built an outline along its perimeter. When he pulled the object away, he had made a hammer out of blocks.My daughter's first instinct was to make jewelry. For a long while, she attempted to make a perfect circle with the colorful pieces. It took many failures before my daughter accepted that it was impossible to not break. She would spend a lengthy amount of time crafting a large necklace, only for it to fragment the millisecond it hit her neck, and then she would go right back at reassembling. She was very motivated. These blocks do that for kids. They are a great toy to have in your arsenal.The pieces allow for movement in whatever work is created. They twist and turn if you've fashioned them to do so. The creative adult could find pleasure from designing with these.",

My 3 year old can do it easily but it's harder to \"see\" your creative vision because they're so small, so they're better enjoyed by older kids (my 7 year old loves them).",
