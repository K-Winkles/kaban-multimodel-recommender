There is plenty for them to play with and share with 2 sets. I also secretly love playing with this! So many ways to design the flowers! Fun for creative pretend play, and even our 1 year old can build the flowers well. Some small pieces so beware for younger kids, but fun if they are watched carefully. Great for fine motor skills and creativity",

She makes lovely little flowers and even colour sorts too. The quality is amazing. It has a green bag to store it away for ease. My only criticism is it doesn\u2019t come in bags, it\u2019s all chucked in the box but that\u2019s no issue. Very easy for children to learn what to do. I also became addicted to playing with it \ud83d\ude02 the photos show only some of the flowers and stems.",
