The designs are not difficult to build and the pieces are sturdy yet easily assembled. They are a bit bendy and make building super easy for the little ones! The pieces are quite small! So, personally I don\u2019t recommend them for little ones under 4 years old. Within minutes he\u2019d built the giraffe and the tree. He\u2019s currently working on the tank! Lovely for creative children, and his older brother whose 12 even liked playing with them! Fun for all ages!! If you\u2019re considering buying, go for it!! It came in neat and organized packaging. Everything was clean and ready to play!",

Of course, he uses all his blocks together, and these are well used. They are not for little ones who still put things in their mouths as they are small. They can also be challenging, since there are no base pieces, you have to build and sometimes hold what you are working on. But they are nicely made, and you get a lot of pieces. They don't match Legos as far as blocks go, but they are an interesting addition if you have a builder!",

They have provided so much entertainment for my kids. The kids have surprised me with what they have built using these blocks. Anyone that has come over and seen them or their kids have played with them ask for the link to buy. The amount of creativity that goes into each of my kids builds is amazing. I love these blocks and so happy I purchased them. We still love Legos but who doesn't like to switch it up sometimes and try something new. Comes with a zippered bag which will come in handy when we finally leave to go home.",
