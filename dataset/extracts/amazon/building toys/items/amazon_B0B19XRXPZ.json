Many go together fairly easily, but many are a bit difficult to put together, and most are a little bit of a challenge to take apart. 7+ years old at least for the fine motor strength and dexterity to pull them apart. Our set was missing 10 pieces. I have 6 students and want them each to have 100 pieces for math activities, so that is really annoying. I imagine if they short all boxes by 10, most people won\u2019t count them and over time it means more profit for them. Maybe it was a mistake. If I didn\u2019t actually need all 600 pieces, it is likely I wouldn\u2019t have noticed.",
