Everything is very organized, all the pieces click together with their magnet very well and it's really easy to get started on a big project.The magnets are good and strong and allow for a great number of builds. There's no sharp corner or edges and none of the pieces are small, so you can let your kids play without having hover over them.There's even an included stand for displaying things you've put together.

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve ordered several different types of these magnetic tiles for my kids. This one is kind of middle of the road for me. I love the pretty colors and it\u2019s cool it comes with a couple pieces that other sets don\u2019t have. For instance it has some cool hexagon pieces and a set up to be able to make a while Ferris wheel. The downside to that is that the pieces used for that Ferris wheel and the window pieces are just plastic and not magnetic at all and are included in the total piece count. Once you count the actual magnetic pieces it\u2019s only 90 which feels a little like a rip off. The window pieces are especially a rip off in my opinion. I\u2019ve seen several sets add them to increase piece count but they\u2019re poor quality and not even that fun to play with.Some other things I noticed about this set is that the box isn\u2019t one that would be great for storing the pieces like some are. I will probably just throw it away. It does come with a bag but that\u2019s just not as convenient for storage. It does have a breakdown of how many of each piece listed on the manual which I always appreciate so I can make sure none are lost. The manual also has some examples of what you can build and only includes structures that can be fully made with pieces from just this one set. I hate when they include cool stuff but that you don\u2019t have the pieces for.I have two ways I compare the magnet quality on these sets. The first is to build a cube and see how easy it is to collapse it. The other is by hanging as many square pieces from each other as I can before they give way and drop. This held 5 which is pretty standard. Id say this set falls middle of the road for both these tests. It should be strong enough to be able to build a tall tower without it collapsing but it\u2019s not nearly as strong as others I\u2019ve tried. The pieces are very squared as well which should lend to more precise building which is nice.Overall I think this is a decent set. It\u2019s not my favorite but I think most kids would be happy to play with it and not get overly frustrated with the magnet strength. I probably would recommend other sets before this one though as there are several better sets within the same price range.",

                "reviewText": "My grandchildren were so excited when I showed them the box, especially the girls! They said it reminded them of a favorite movie of theirs. ;) The pieces are sturdy and the variety is great! They created castles - inspired by the pictures on box. The magnets are strong and this helps with building higher structures. They commented that they wished there were more of the hexagon pieces. They played for at least an hour and commented that they should bring over their set from home to make even more things! I would highly recommend this set to families with kids 3-33!",

I love that it has enough pieces to build decent sized structures, and that the magnets are a great quality to help keep eveything sturdy. My 5 year old and I built a fun princess castle with this, and she was able to pick it up and move it by herself without the whole thing collapsing.I love this set more than others that I have seen - I would highly recommend it and think this is totally giftable as well.",
