My son is really tall for his age and has huge hands, however, the handle drill/screwdriver is way to thick for him to hold it with one hand while pressing the buttons for it to turn. Also, the buttons are rather hard to push. He ha to use both hands and press really hard on them.The screws go easily in and out of the white box. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t seem to be very sturdy, as I found several of them broken apart.That being said, my son enjoys playing with this tool box every once in a while and that is what matters most.",
