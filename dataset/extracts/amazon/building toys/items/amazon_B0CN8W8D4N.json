                "reviewText": "We got this typewriter set for our 14 year old daughter who likes to decorate her room with building sets on display. She really likes this one.The pieces are of good quality, and they fit and hold together well. They are smaller than normal Lego pieces, but not as small as with some \"micro\" brick sets. We found them easy to work with even for teenage and adult sized hands. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. The only time we had any potential confusion was later in the build when there are three slightly different L-shaped elbow pieces. It would be easy to think they are all identical and not notice the slight variation in the angle of the bend of the L shape. Thankfully we realized we'd used a wrong piece or two quickly and fixed it before it made any difference. But watch those elbow shaped pieces and notice the slightly different angles!The finished build looks great and is very display-worthy. A close look will reveal that the number of keys per row doesn't match a real typewriter, so you end up with the \"P\" key on the bottom row rather than the top (like it would be in real life), for example. But that doesn't bother me. It's much more about the retro mechanical vibe, and this set conveys that very nicely.Overall a fun, good quality, and very good looking set at a very reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "Since there is no way I\u2019ll ever be able to afford the official Lego Ideas typewriter, when I saw this little inexpensive typewriter brick set I jumped at the chance. When it arrived, my 9 year old son and I sat down to build it together.First off, this set uses mini bricks. The resulting build is small as a result. Second, the instructions are OK, but you do have a bit more peering at them than modern lego sets because they don\u2019t break out the steps quite as extensively. It\u2019s not bad, just a bit more work to decipher than modern Lego enthusiasts might be used to.One think I\u2019ve noticed with some of these knock off brands is that they bricks don\u2019t always fit together well or the models fall apart easily because of bad bricks and poor design. For the most part, that\u2019s not an issue with this set. It\u2019s fairly well designed and it holds together pretty well against play. Some of the Technics style pieces are not well made. All of the typewrite key arms were warped in some way though since they are hidden in the body of the typewriter, it\u2019s not so bad.I also do have one complaint about the design of the set. The designers crowded the top row over the middle row, and it doesn\u2019t look as nice as it would otherwise as a result. Playing with typing on the keys doesn\u2019t work as well as it could for the same reason. They needed to space them out another row or two. But it is what it is.Fun little build that looks nice when its done and won\u2019t break the bank compared to Lego brand items. I think the design could have been a bit better, but for the price it\u2019s not a bad value.",
