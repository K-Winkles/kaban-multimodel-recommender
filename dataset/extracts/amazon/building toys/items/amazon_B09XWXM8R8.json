                "reviewText": "The LEGO Speed Champions 007 Aston Martin DB5 76911 Building Set is an absolute gem in my LEGO collection. As a fan of the James Bond franchise and a LEGO enthusiast, this 298-piece set perfectly combines my interests.The first thing to note is the attention to detail. LEGO has done a remarkable job of capturing the classic lines and distinctive features of the Aston Martin DB5, one of the most iconic cars in the Bond series. The scale model includes a variety of detailed elements such as the sleek silver color scheme, the Aston Martin logo, and even the distinctive wheel design.The build experience was enjoyable and engaging, appropriate for the recommended age group of 8+. The instructions were clear and easy to follow, and the set offered enough complexity to keep the process interesting without being overwhelming. It took me a couple of hours to complete, making it a fun afternoon project.The finished model is compact yet impressively accurate, making it a great display piece. It comes with a unique James Bond mini-figure and a display stand, enhancing its appeal as a collector's item.The durability of the model is also commendable. Despite its intricate design, it holds together well, and I've had no issues with pieces falling off during play.However, it's worth noting that the set doesn't include many of the spy gadgets associated with the DB5 in the James Bond films, like the ejector seat or hidden weapons. While this might be a slight disappointment for hardcore Bond fans, it doesn't detract from the overall appeal of the set.In conclusion, the LEGO Speed Champions 007 Aston Martin DB5 76911 Building Set is a delightful build and a great tribute to an iconic car. It offers an enjoyable build experience, a high level of detail, and plenty of play and display potential. Whether you're a fan of LEGO, James Bond, classic cars, or all three, this set is a fantastic addition to your collection.",

                "reviewText": "I built this w/ my 7 year old. It is one of the most fun builds I can remember. Most of the pieces are 1 flat unit high, which makes for some elaborate layering and stronger connections. The level of detail is fantastic too. For a Bond and Lego fan, this is a must-have.My complaints are:Quality control is wild here! Not counting the interchangeable license plates, we have about a dozen random small pieces left over. For example, there's supposed to be 4 \"cow horn\" pieces, but we have 5. We ended up with an extra microphone (stick shift) and \"exhaust nozzle\", which looks suspiciously like a gun. So in addition to his wrench, he now has his signature Walter PKK and a mic for karaoke.1) We had some pieces missing, like the side wall, causing us not to be able to attach the front headlight.2) sticker hell: there are 15 stickers to put on, for door handles and license plates. Very easy to misalign. Some details like the front grill are painted on, so why not the others?3) some pieces are chrome. It's not entirely clear in the instructions. The only way to differentiate it from a regular grey piece is a small white speck on the diagram!4) where to put the 8 extra license plates. The trunk doesn't open.It looks fantastic, even with the missing piece. We'll request it from Lego's site.",
