This is really a great set that is good for working on many skills such as sorting, number correspondence, numbers, colors, fine motor skills, tool function and vocabulary etc. Brio uses quality heavy plastic and real wood and gives you the basis for how to use connectors and what goes with what.Reviews have stated they wished this set came with instructions but that would not be anything more than another logo set. If you get the idea of creating your own toys/pieces then you will really enjoy this set. My son loves making his creations and so do I. He then plays with them and we take them apart. The bolts, nuts and other parts have great torque and are solid when attaching.Lots of value for the price and is a great developmental set.",

I felt like one box was nice, but we just didn't have quite as much of the pieces we needed to build things we wanted to build. The price is not great for the amount that you get, however the quality is really good. I have 2.5 year old twins who bang away at it with the hammer, and it's holding up really well. There is a variety of screws, nails and connection pieces that give you a nice choice for how you want to build. There is an included inspiration book, but it only has two ideas for you to build and does not come with directions for how to build it, just what pieces you need. For us, this isn't a big deal, but my husband prefers directions and it drives him nuts. I like that this set is so open ended. We will definitely be adding to our collection over time.",

                "reviewText": "As a kid who grew up with (and still plays with) Lego, Erector Sets, K'Nex, Lincoln Logs, Fiddlesticks, and who knows what other kids building materials, I think this is the best choice for a toddler who has taken an interest in putting things together. Even our almost 2 year old loves playing with the screwdriver. The kids always see us putting together furniture and want to jump in and help, so this was perfect for them. I think it's a much better educational tinker toy for children that young. It doesn't require too much dexterity and it still allows for a lot of freedom of creation. Also goes great with the Brio train sets, which my partner uses with lessons in her classroom. I got this kit, but would recommend the bigger box set that is around $70. There's not enough pieces to share if there's more than 1 kid.",

                "reviewText": "My 2.5 and 5 year olds LOVE this set. We purchased the bigger set for them for Christmas last year, but added this one since they were always running short on certain pieces. We try to stick to open-ended toys like this for them. This is one of the few building toys they have that requires zero adult help. My 5 year old builds the most incredible airplanes and my 2.5 year old loves building basic cars. The possibilities are endless and I love seeing what they come up with! Great quality as expected from Brio - has stood up well to my two boys!",

                "reviewText": "This has been one of the best purchases I have made for my son who is now 4. He will spend time every single day building a new \"machine\". He uses such creativity and comes up with all sorts of stuff. It doesn't come with too many ideas in the booklet which is for the better since it is great for free play and allows the child to use their own imagination. I was surprised at how heavy the hammer is for being plastic. It is definitely more heavy duty then any other play hammer I have come across. I would say the same thing about the screwdriver too. This is a QUALITY set.",

                "reviewText": "I really love that Brio has created this serious construction set for preschoolers! I bought our set on the recommendation of an occupational therapist who uses it with her clients, and it has seen quite a bit of play from my three younger kids (aged 7, 5, and 2 - the 2yo needs help to make anything serious).This set provides great fine motor practice for kids!I do wish you could screw or hammer pieces into the plastic platforms - it would allow for even more construction options. Also, as other reviewers have noted, this kit does not come with instructions - it is a free build set for kids to use however they see fit.",
