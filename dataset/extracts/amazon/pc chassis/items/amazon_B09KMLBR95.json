                "reviewText": "Front USB ports didn\u2019t work upon arrival. I contacted Silverstone directly about this. They took awhile to respond but, very promptly responded to corresponding emails and sent me out a new usb hub the same day. The case is fantastic and has plenty of gpu space especially for 30 series cards. The supplied fans are quiet and move air well. The case has a pivoting feature that allows easy access to all internal components and made it a breeze to setup. This case blows the Cooler Master NC100 out of the water in ease of use and Internal space. I just wish it came in white to match my setup.",
