This was the best rackmount chassis I found for my project and it works beautifully. The unit was designed and built well, quality materials were used, and overall a very user friendly case. I am using it to house leftover pc parts running ubuntu for fun tests, and this chassis can easily handle most builts within spec.If this product becomes available again, please buy it. It's a great buy. The only request I would have is to have a 3U and a 4U option available in the same style with front fans. They might exist but I don't see them here on Amazon.Keep up the great work Silverstone!",

                "reviewText": "You already know what you are looking at, so I will get straight to the problems.1. The interior power cord extension (plugs into your ATX PSU and extends the receptacle to the back) is poor quality. It has no no safety markings (UL/ETL) and unbelievably, would not fit in my power supply (Seasonic Prime GX 1300W). The plug tolerances on the cheap *hardwired* (not replaceable) extension cord inside the case are subpar. This means it will fit in some PSUs and others will require you to sand down the plug.2. The bend on that cheap internal extension makes me uncomfortable. You cannot relieve the strain due to how the PSU mounts.3. Rails should be included at this price. They charge an additional $70 for rails and they are often out of stock.4. If your mobo uses angled connectors for USB3 or SATA, you are going to have a tough time with the clearance between the side of the board and the mid frame.5. You should also consider the need for a 2U CPU cooler, also sold separately for $40.All in all, I would research more options when it comes time to buy another.",

                "reviewText": "2U cases are designed for a limited foot print and you should only buy this case understanding that:1. You will be limited to a CPU cooler height of <70mm.2. There are limits to the size of Power Supply you can use. Most rack cases require you to buy a special form factor of PSU. This one can fit a standard ATX PSU under 160mm in length, so an 850W will fit no problem.3. No rack case comes with rails - it's always something you need to buy extra, with much more expensive cases (not saying this is good, but it is the reality).4. Only low profile expansion cards are supported.The user who left this review would have been better off buying a 4U case to convert their desktop over to rack mount.That being said, what this case does, it's very good at. You can fit an ATX mobo/PSU inside, which is hard to find for a home lab. It's got excellent airflow (front to back) for cooling. Convertable 5.25\" bays for more drive storage. It's great bang for your buck. Comparable cases from Supermicro are 2x-3x the price.",
