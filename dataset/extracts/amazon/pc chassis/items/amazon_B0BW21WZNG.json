                "reviewText": "I got this case because of the new generation of graphics cards being so large. I have a RTX 4090 that measures 14 inches and this case makes it look tiny. Everything about this case is over the top and it is the largest case I've ever seen. It's very well built and the airflow so far seems really great. The front USB-C ports support 60W fast charging so this is the first time I've ever actually used my computer to charge my phone while I'm at my desk. Comes with 4 140mm fans and a fan/rgb hub that came in really clutch with my build. The screw driver and little drawer is actually really useful and I think it's a nice addition. This will probably be the last computer case I will ever have to buy!",

This case is very big, very heavy, with lots of internal space that can fit a large GPU, RTX 4090 for my case. The magnetic side panels are excellent for quick open and close when needed. Both side panels are not completely sealed, leaving space for more air flow inside to cool the internal parts. Compared to my older PC case ROG GX601, my CPU get about 8 degrees Celsius cooler.",

                "reviewText": "It is not very often I run into a case I really like, I have owned over 100 cases the past twenty years. Only have ran into one that was pure quality out of the box and it was the last case designed by the once owner/founder of Voodoo PC sixteen years ago until now. The Hyperion is amazing out of the box, it is pre cable managed almost like someone from one of the top pc builder companies did it for you, it is easy to work with, the cooling of the exoskeletal aluminum frame. that has air drawn over it working as a passive air cooler before it has a chance to make it into the case does an amazing job. It has anything you could need out of the box, There is almost nothing you need to buy unless you want to vertically mount your gpu then you just need the pcie cable for the card, it comes with the plate for the back of the case to vertically mount plus a vertical mount support built in. The included fans are amazing with the case's passive cooling. This is by far the nicest case released that I have had the pleasure of working with in sixteen years.This review is for the 90 day warranty extension program.",
