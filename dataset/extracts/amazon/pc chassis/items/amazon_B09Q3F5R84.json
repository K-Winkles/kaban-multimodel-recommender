(which admittedly would make the case taller.-Some clear markings (I didn't see any) for assembly. It took about 15 minutes of trial and error to assemble it, and (admittedly left the hard drives mounted incorrectly because it looks better.)-flush mounting holes/tabs so I can wall mount this more easily.I'd pay 5 bucks extra for optional wall/psu bracketing.",

Some minor issues: threads on all holes are not threaded well, you need to force the screw a bit, base and back section don't quite line up perfectly, space for mounting HD is a bit too small to be useful. As you can see from the picture I added a 2 HD mounting chassis, USB and audio ports chassis and custom made power switch/reset switch/power LED/HD LED/speaker bracket.",

It does fit ATX just fine, I have fitted 18 motherboards already without problem. A full ATX power supply does fit but you only get two screws on one side to hold it in. All the fasteners and stand offs are the lowest quality and honestly hurt this product since I bet most complaints stem from them.",

The instructions outlined two types. No big deal but worth noting due to the threads varying.I didn\u2019t expect much more than a secure place to test gear and this will do nicely. Plenty of hardware. Great packaging. Engrish instructions. And a fancy hex head driver to install the standoffs. I\u2019m not quite sure what the semi-transparent plastic hickeys are for, though.I will gladly vouch for this product. Hopefully the attached images help make sense of assembly.@darthkielbasa",
