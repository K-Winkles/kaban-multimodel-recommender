                "reviewText": "Some of the reviews for this case are crazy. It's a $69 (nice) case. If you go in expecting it to be as good or better than a $200 case, you'll be disappointed. Similarly, if you spend $10,000 on a Honda and expect it to be the same as a $70,000 Cadillac, you'll be disappointed.That being said, it's a really amazing case, not even considering the price. The RGB fans are bright with lots of color options. There is no RGB controller, which is just one less thing to break. The RGB fans are powered by SATA and the button that controls them on top is easy. They're also quiet, inaudible.I'm not saying it's perfect, it's not. I've built 8 computers using this case and I've had issues with 2 of them. On one, one of the top USB ports was cutting in and out. On another one, the RGB on the front fans wasn't working. Am I mad? Absolutely not, just return it to Amazon and get a new one. Easy. I'm not paying $69 for great quality control, and if you are, I don't think you're being reasonable.Yes, the rear I/O has the metal break away style parts. Is it really that big of a deal? When have you broken one out and then said \"darn, I want to downgrade GPUs and put one back in.\"?The shape of the case is a little strange. It's quite tall and not very long. I'd rather have more room for a 3 fan GPU rather than room for larger mobo, but again, it's $69.One tip is to take the Raidmax stickers off of the front fans. They're not cut perfectly round, so they give the appearance that the fans are wobbling. The front panal is easy to remove and so are the stickers.",

Either 2 120 mm fans, a 240 mm radiator, or both will fit in the top of the inside of the case. Would recommend to anyone building a PC!",

The LED's on the fans never worked, so the lights never came on and could not be controlled. The top speaker and USB jacks never worked. I've assembled dozens of PC's and I am positive the wiring was just fine. What gets me is that I contacted the company Radmax on their website using the \"Contact us\" twice. No response for support help. Sent them an email to Info@ and no response either. It is past the amazon return window so i'm left with a $90 paperweight. I'm buying another brand and sending this to ewaste. Speaking of waste, don't waste your money or time with a cheap piece of garbage and a company that will not support or help. FYI - My kid was really sad as he was looking forward to a gamer PC with Lights.",
