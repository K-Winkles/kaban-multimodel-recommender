                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Decent classic case with some caveats",
                "reviewText": "If you're used to Silverstone mATX cases like the TJ08 or PS07, keep in mind this case is quite a bit smaller. There is almost no room to route any cables around the back of the motherboard. I was initally able to route the cpu 8 pin barely, but there's no way to route the 24 pin atx cable around the back. Depending on your goals, this may be fine. When I upgraded my PSU, I decided to just route the CPU power around the front instead. If you want to keep any cables tidy toward the bottom of the motherboard, you may want to get some zip tie adhesive mounts to stick to the bottom of the case.All that said, it looks fine, it works fine. I was able to mount a DVD drive and a 3.5\" HDD hot swap in the two 5.25\" bays. The first ATX PSU I used was 160mm depth, and I would recommend not going any deeper than that. I wanted a better quality PSU, though, and ended up switching to a 140mm depth PSU, which gives more room for managing the cables in the front.The 3.5\" HDD cage is permanently riveted into the case, which is unfortunate, as I don't need it, and it's just in the way when installing the motherboard and when routing cables. Once you have your system installed, if you need to get the motherboard out for any reason, this fixed cage is going to make it more of a pain than it needs to be. Most modern mATX boards will take at least 2 m2 ssd's, and with the 2 5.25\" bays, you could cram a lot of 2.5\" sata ssd's or 3 3.5\" HDD's if you make use of some good hot swap modules like Icy Dock has. Take a look at the Icy Dock MB604SPO-B or MB153SP-B for example. I have several Silverstone cases and I've removed the 3.5\" drive mount cages from all of them (those were removable) as I find them unnecessary and antiquated. But of course, you're not buying this case if you're trying to be modern with the status quo, so YMMV.The rear fan is a 3pin that works fine. I had another 3pin Silverstone 120mm that I mounted up front, and the case airflow seems good for a case of this size. I'd recommend adding a 120mm front fan to get the best airflow.Overall, the case is a decent option in a niche market that's fading. I'm talking about classic computer cases that still have 5.25\" bays. One other thing I miss is acrylic windows in side panels. Silverstone used to offer that on their TJ08 and PS07 cases, but no longer for whatever reason, despite still making those cases with solid side panels. I like acrylic windows, I like 5.25\" bays, I like mATX, but unfortunately everything that I like is fading from the earth. C'est la vie.Happy building.",
