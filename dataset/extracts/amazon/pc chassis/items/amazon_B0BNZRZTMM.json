My brother asked me if I could keep my eyes on it just in case the similar one showed up on my recommended page.The first impression was that the material that it made from, high gauge, Zinc-Coated Steel steel I believe, felt good and gave me the confidence of material quality for sure. It comes with the 2 front access USB 3.0 that are also compatible with USB2.0 if that's the header you need on your motherboard. Make sure the fan intake just in case , which definitely was enough in our case.It has not been long but so far so good. And I do think the cost performance is great in terms of overall quality you get vs price.",
