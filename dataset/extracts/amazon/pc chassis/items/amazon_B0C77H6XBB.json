Overall a nice pc case wish it also had a usb c port on the front but it doesn't so you will only have usb c on your mob if it has them.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not finished with the PC I'm building in this case. However, its a great case for showing off a custom water cooled build. Also, this case is very similar in style to other higher priced cases made by Antec and Cougar.Pros:Case comes fully assembled, except for the glass panels.Looks similar to some popular higher priced cases.Striking apeparance that reminds me of a motorcycle, mech, or helicoptor.Supports up to two 360mm radiators for custom water cooling or two AIO coolers for the CPU and GPU.Plenty of interior space on the metal aprts to attach LED strips for lighting effects.Cons:Not enough packing material. The top metal part of the case was bent, dented, and scratched. I'm not sure if I can fix it without hammering the metal flat and repainting it.Only one USB 3 port on the front of the case even though the cable and motherboard connector supports two USB 3 ports.No USB C ports on the front of the case.If yours arrives undamaged and you don't care about USB 3 or USB C ports on the front, its a great deal.",
