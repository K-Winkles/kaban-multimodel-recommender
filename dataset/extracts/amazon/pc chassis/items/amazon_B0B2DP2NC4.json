                "reviewText": "This case looks fantastic and is much more compact than my previous case, a Thermaltake Core V21. It also does away with all the problems I had with that case - the feet aren't flimsy plastic things that snap off with the slightest shear force, the panel is glass rather than scratch-prone acrylic, and there's no included fans to be flimsy and loud. The last point does mean that you need to budget in fans, but it also means you can pick the fans you want.Something to note is that the front panel has a USB-C port, but it only uses a USB-3 connection to the motherboard. You can connect your USB-C devices to the front panel, but you will only get USB-3 speeds. On the other hand, that makes it more accessible to older motherboards without the special USB-C connector, and unless you're frequently transferring very large files between external drives it shouldn't matter too much.I only have two gripes with this case:One is that the cable management space is very tight for if you choose to use sleeved cable extensions; I wanted a purple theme, so I got purple extensions, but they make it rather hard to put on the side panel covering the cable tray. I had to put quite a bit of pressure on the panel to make it fit, even after a fair amount of trying to move things around. A few more millimeters of space would have been appreciated for me.The second gripe is that the top cutout for the SSD mounts facing the outside of the case goes straight into your power supply if you have an ATX power supply. I couldn't figure out how I would be able to route them, so I ended up putting both my SSDs in the remaining two slots instead. Maybe I somehow did something wrong, but I don't see how. This shouldn't be a big problem unless you have 4 drives, but it's something to consider.",

                "reviewText": "Extremely good value for money, very little expense spared in manufacturing, considering the price point! Though some might take issue with a molex power connector being used for the ARGB fan board. But really thats picking bones!The side panel is a high quality glass, very shiny! Great for the RGB colours if that's your bag. A single layer pair of dust filters cover the top and bottom PSU shroud, whilst the front intake is covered by a double layer of mesh and dust filters. This enables very good airflow whilst the case stays very resistant to the dreaded dust mites!There is ample room for cable management with 1-2 inches of clearance. Even better if like me, you have nothing but a PCI-E, 8-pin CPU and some front panel connectors connected to the board itself - airflow is extremely good as a result of having such \"open plan\" space within the case... I'm using a 1tb NVME.The fans are excellent little coolers, operating at quite a low RPM on both the high and low switches, the air-passing efficiency is comparable to any full tower case at double the price. Coupled with a Hyper 212 Black CPU cooler and a freshly cleaned, re-pasted RX 580 (8GB), my R5 2600 (@3.8GHZ) and OC'd 580, have not yet passed 55c and 69c under fairly heavy gaming load.Side note - the heat dissipation is also fantastic, once an intensive game/application is closed, my temps will immediately drop by 20c and then very rapidly decline back to idle temps (GPU @22c and CPU @28c).The ARGB switch board is a great and has a wide array of colour modes for the fans, which acts as a great replacer for mATX boards, considering the lack of pwm connecters associated with mATX.The case comes with all the screws and fittings you'd need and expect, they also offer black cable ties too.All in all fantastic bang for buck with very little to criticise at all. If I had to pick any bones at all I'd highlight the molex power connector for the ARGB board and perhaps a lack of fan switch option's, you have high, off and low... But again, it's kind of irrelevant.",

                "reviewText": "The Gamemax Kamikzae Pro is a very good case, prefect for an matx build and has a lot of featues that are just amazing for the price. First off the magnetic dust filters on the top, bottom and front of the case are amazing to keep dust away for your expensive PC parts. It comes with 4 argb fans pre installed and they are wired to the rgb module to controll the colour of the fans with one button on the front of the case. This just awsome for the price as some cases in this price rage may not even come with fans preinstalled. Moving onto the front IO of the case. It features a LED controll button to controll the rgb in the case fans and or anything hooked up to the RGB hub, a pair of USB 2.0 ports and a pair of USB 3.0 ports aswell which is great, headphone and microphone jack, reset switch and a switch to controll the speed of the fans. It alos a PSU shroud so plenty of space the PSU and all unwanted cables. Lots of tie off points making cable management easy, and also a cage for the a hardrive and mounting slots for a SSD. Also enough space at the top of an AIO or liquid cooling loop and pump.The tempered glass side pannel is also cool if you have rgb components to show off, to power the fans it uses a SATA power connecter which is also convenient. Moving onto a couple downsides is that you need to remove the cage to mount a HDD and it only fit mATX motherboard and smaller not ATX or larger. Not a deal breaker for me but should be fine to build a PC in for the first time very consumer friendly.Thanks, Alan",
