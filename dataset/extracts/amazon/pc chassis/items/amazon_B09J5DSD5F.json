                "reviewText": "I built a computer for my daughter using this case and it turned out extremely well. I used an ATX motherboard, 850 watt PSU, large air cooler for CPU, and a full size RTX 3080 GPU. The case is solidly constructed, made with quality materials, and easily accommodates standard size components. Being a mid size case, I'd recommend it for an average or common component set. If you're going for super compact and light, you don't need a case of this size or weight. If you're building a mega computer with huge liquid coolers and such, probably you should look for something specifically designed for that. But for the majority of self built computers, this is an awesome case that will give you zero problems with your build.",

Plenty of space inside for larger components and keeping wiring out of sight.",

Airflow will be affected even at full 800rpm. No front intake filter means more dust will enter the case. The perforated mesh is not fine enough to be used as a dust filter. The picture in the ad says it supports 140mm exhaust fan but only 120mm can fit. The gpu swivel fan on top of the hard drive bay seems nice but has no argb. It would have been nice if the hard drive bay had a cover. The removable plastic psu shroud is nice for those who want to show their high end psu or have air intake from the inside of the case to help with airflow. The 200mm fans has a slight wobble at any speed. It's a nice big case but the small fan mounts on the front ruined the potential high airflow. This is basically an old case back from 2010 that has rgb lighting and a glass side panel to make it look modern.",
