                "reviewText": "Easy to build in. Running a MSI ATX motherboard with a 280 MM liquid cooler and fits with minimal problems. I have it top mounted, so I had to remove the 3 fans on top. Lots of cable management holes and opportunities. Multiple SSD and hard drive mounts. The included case fans are of acceptable volume and air throughput.My main complaint is around the RGB controller. There isn\u2019t a place to mount it. The way that each fan links together is confusing. And it often doesn\u2019t even pull enough power from the motherboard to power all the fans. I removed it and have no complaints, RGB doesn\u2019t really increase performance anyways.",

                "reviewText": "This is a big case, metal exterior, and comes with a lot of features that you'd want in a higher end case, but for a relatively low price. Obviously, it's off-brand, which makes me doubly suspicious, but I gave it a try. The fan controller that's included feels pretty low-end, but it works, and like the 7 preinstalled fans, the fact that it's included at all in this price range is unexpected and very welcome.Overall, this case booted up well with a test system, all my fans are spinning and synced, so no issues there.I am not a fan of either the front or back panel designs, as the front uses an odd hinge system on the glass panel that just seems designed to break easily if you mishandle it slightly, and the back panel is difficult to screw into place. For now, this looks like a good value.",
