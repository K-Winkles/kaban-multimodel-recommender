                "reviewText": "Summary: H6 is a perfect middle ground case between the historically cramped square cases and the newly emerging massive fish tank cases. Cooling performance is great and the price makes it a perfect balance of aesthetics, awesome performance, and lower price. Build quality is the standard amazing quality expected from NZXT cases.Pros- Super easy to build in! Tons of space for cable routing and management, especially in the back and at the top of the mobo where it\u2019s usually a pain. Plenty of space for extra PSU cable length from cable kits or non-modular PSUs.- All panels pop off and on very easily. Incredibly easy to work with.- Case looks even better in person! The full glass gives a beautiful view of components.- Going from a glass front H510, I thought the full mesh would make my system much louder, but it\u2019s just as quiet. That\u2019s largely dependent on fans and their RPMs, but my same build in this case is quieter, perhaps from the angled fans being pointed away from where I\u2019m sitting.- The recessed fan slots in the bottom of the case both look interesting and also seem to work exceptionally well. I\u2019m seeing 7 degree (C) GPU temp reduction under load compared to my prior H510, but there are also multiple more fan slots on this case. Whether it\u2019s the lower 140 slots or the front, I\u2019m stoked to see that much of a GPU temp reduction given how intense games push GPU these days.- My favorite little detail is a small hook between the back exhaust fan and the top of the case. This allows you to route that cable safely so wire interference is not a concern.- I thought this case was going to be a lot wider of a footprint than it actually is. It is wider than my prior H510 due to the PSU being behind the mobo instead of beneath it, but it\u2019s totally worth the extra space given the cooling performance and it doesn\u2019t feel or look too big like some of the larger fish tanks cases are.Cons- Honestly, I haven\u2019t found a true con yet. Biggest con I can think of is that the included fans come with a pre installed splitter. That splitter is too short to run to a mobo header, but it\u2019s plenty of length if you have a Kraken or other NZXT RGB or Fan controller.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Ideal airflow with a clean design.",
                "reviewText": "Had a gargantuan NZXT Phantom for several years, and had been seeing this style of case explode in popularity over the last several months. The H6 Flow kinda came out of nowhere (to me, at least), just as I was about to start ordering upgrades so I could actually run some of the most recent pc releases. This case is a far more manageable size, and as a long time fan of NZXT cases, this new offering does not disappoint.Obvious comparisons to other dual chamber/aquarium style cases aside, the H6 boasts a functional clipped front corner that comes stock with 3x120mm intake fans. At this angle, the fans blow air directly towards your GPU, as well as your CPU's air cooler tower, if you're using one.The biggest objective con in this case is that the bottom fan mounts, which are recessed to allow for a clean and streamlined installation, are restricted to 140mm fans. As seen in my attached picture, 120mm fans will just kinda... float there, but since the RGB is so extensive on mine, I almost consider it a feature. But for the sake of maximum airflow and making sure the case is a positive air pressure environment, it is something I'll address at a later date.One other important thing to bear in mind is the available depth for tower coolers. I'm not sure if it's obvious from the picture, but the leading fan is actually contacting the glass side panel. It literally could not fit any tighter. That being said, I'd either recommend opting for water cooling on the CPU, or having low profile RAM sticks for air cooling, but that's mostly dependent on how your MOBO is laid out. :POverall, the H6 Flow was fun to build in and looks spectacular once everything's up and running. Build quality is sturdy, along with good options for cable management tucked behind the motherboard tray, and all at a very competitive, budget-friendly price.",

                "reviewText": "I love PC cases, like my wife likes shoes. Every couple of years, I find myself finding another case for my goodies, and this year it was the H6 Flow. My build is a 4090, 7950, 1200W PS, and a 280mm NZXT RAD. I also replaced the front fans with Lian Li SLV2 fans. The bottom fans, I used 2 Noctura. I also grabbed the vertical mount for the GPU for cosmetic reasons, but to my surprise, the front angled fans do a much better job keeping it cool this way. Cable management is excellent, and while the 280mm rad was a chore to install at the top, it does fit, and the lian-li fans as well, although I did need to make a small mod to get them in there which meant removing a couple of the plastic bits for the front grill. No big deal, just replace them with double sided clear tape. Form factor is great. I hate monster sized cases, and this fit the bill perfectly.",
