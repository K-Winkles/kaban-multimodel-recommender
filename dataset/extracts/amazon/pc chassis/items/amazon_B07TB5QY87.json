                "reviewText": "This is my first \u201cmodern\u201d style case I\u2019ve built. The last case I used is probably 10-15 years old now and let me tell you, the days of ugly interiors and sharp edges are gone.The back side of the case has guides for the wires, and the case was designed to hide the motherboard cables as much as possible.It fits a full size (ATX) power supply and does have enough room to hide the cables from a non-modular power supply. Airflow is good if you ditch the NZXT fans. They may be quiet, but they\u2019re pretty worthless for airflow.There\u2019s most likely enough room for a dual 140mm radiator. I went with a dual 120 because I wasn\u2019t sure if a 140 would fit.Really my only complaint with the case is it\u2019s difficult to find a water pump/rad that fits. I found one that\u2019s 120mm and I had to do some funky stuff with fittings on top of the reservoir and it BARELY fits. Like, it touches on the top.Many people hate on the H210 case because it\u2019s not a \u201ctrue\u201d SFF pc, but that\u2019s mostly because they give you room to run a full size PSU and room to hide the cables.I still have some work do do with my wiring, as my power cables have no combs, etc. All in all, I would recommend this case.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent case overall. Came packaged well and no damage. Has USB 3.2 and type C ports up top by power button. The cable routing in this case is very well thought out, especially with the channels to guide cables with velcro strap to hold them. Tempered glass side panel adds a nice touch if you want the internals visible. I did swap the (2) included 120mm fans out for two white LED fans. Accesory kit comes with everything you should need. It has an male to two female audio adapter (headset/earbuds). Paint job was excellent. Case is small but not nearly as small as some other ITX cases I've built on in years past. I put my Corsair H115i AIO cooler in the front easily. Fits large graphic cars to about 330mm or so I believe. I have an old Sapphire 270X in it for now and it fits easily. The only thing that concerned me initially is the tempered glass side panel. One screw to remove it sounds easy, but when you go to pull the panel outwards you'll think you're going to break the glass. I took a small flathead screwdriver and an old t-shirt to cover it for a pry-bar. It didn't take a lot of pressure and the plastic pegs on the glass panel popped out of the retainer holes. Just be aware if you go to open the glass panel that it will not just lay open easily. You'll have to apply some force to pop it loose. The front panel was a little hard to detach as well. Not bad, just take your time and slowly pry it loose. It reattaches mush easier than taking it off. Removable dust filters for Power Supply and behind the front panel. Overall, very pleased. A beautiful case and well worth it. You can get the \"i\" version with the LED lighting pre-installed for a few more $.",

                "reviewText": "If I could give this case 10 stars I would without hesitation.I am a veteran systems engineer by trade, so I am pretty critical of cases. This one is practically perfect! The build quality is excellent, the built in fan/RGB header is very useful and the software to control it is well developed.It is a goldilocks size case, as well. Not too big, but big enough to not be a pain to work on. Full length graphics cards are no problem to fit. Cable management is excellent and the thermals on this case are some of the best I have ever seen of any case at any size. In my build I run a Ryzen 5600x along with an nVidia 2080Ti all in one custom water loop. I have a single 240mm utra-thin radiator in the front (which fits perfectly in this case, as do more standard size 240mm rads), 2x 120mm fans on the rad, and one case fan. Under 1 hour full load stress (GPU and CPU combined) the GPU never goes over 50c and the CPU gets to the mid 60's, with water temps hovering around 43c. Under typical gaming the GPU stays in the mid 40's and the CPU never gets above 57-58c ... on one single slim 240 radiator! That is just utterly outstanding. Case temps never go higher than 6c over ambient, so the MB, VRM, PCH, and memory stay nice and cool. Kudos to NZXT for carefully considering airflow instead of making it an afterthought.The case is very quiet - the factory included fans not so much. I won't ding the case for this as basically all cases have cheap fans and good one are easy and inexpensive to come by.The case is handsome, yet understated. I would go so far as to call it elegant, in style as well as technical design.In case anyone wishes to replicate my build, any mITX board fits fine. Even dITX fits. The rad I used was the XSPC 240mm ultra thin. The pump was the EKWB FLT120 DDC, which fits perfectly on the back of this case where an optional rear fan would go. The fans are all Phanteks 120mm (F120MP_BK_PWM) at $13.50 apiece on Amazon but Noctua works great too. Radiator fans blow toward the front of the case (push configuration), and top fan blows into the case to cool the mobo and provide a fresh air stream and minimize negative pressure behind the radiator fans.The glass panel is tight, as it should be - this should seal well and not vibrate. The build quality, and fit/finish are simply excellent. If it is not abundantly clear at this point, I simply love this case!",
