                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This case is built around the preinstalled fans and RGB controller. If you don't love these fans then you won't like the case. The case is cheap but it's functional. The large gap between the fans and glass allows for reasonable airflow, the fans are of high quality as well as some of the best RGB there is.There is nothing extraordinary about the case besides the included fans and RGB controller, but I think for a lot of people that is exactly what they are looking for because I didn't find anything bad about the case. There was enough room, there was not hard to run the wires or install anything, the space utilization is good. The cable management is okay, it's a little cramped like many cases behind the motherboard. It's uses grommets so your wires won't get damaged, though I prefer the cable management bar. The cable cut outs are located in good places and the wiring looks nice and tidy behind the glass. The glass is held on with 4 thumb screws with rubber washers, and so is the front panel.These are fully functional fans, full PWM, quiet when are not going full speed, move plenty of air, and or course that great RGB. Really happy with it, one of the best cases I've used.",

                "reviewText": "I gave the product 5 stars because I at least got the case, it's nice, and I'm already familiar with the Corsair iCue fans. It will be a nice case once I get a fully functional item. The glass in the front and the side panel is very thick, thicker than any other tempered glass panels I've seen on other cases, and I've built a Lot of PCs. Bought this listed as Like New directly from Amazon.com, Amazon Warehouse as a mother's day gift for my girl, the listing said the only issue would be the packaging would be damaged. All we got was an empty shell, no fans, no Core lighting node, no installation hardware like mobo standoffs and screws, the 2 removable hard drive bays that you can access from the back were missing, and the dust filter on top was also missing. The cost of replacing all these items would probably be as much, or more, than just paying full price, ridiculous! But the worst part was how happy my girl was to get it in the first place, and how excited she was to see it light up, it was going to be a great grand finale for her mother's day, now I don't get to see the joy on her face til another day. Still looking forward to it, but Serious fail on Amazon for this one. This rating is for the item itself and it is a quality case. I like it, seems like it will be easy enough to work in. The steel is sturdy, and the iCue fans have a great reputation for a reason, they look good and last a good amount of time. I'm still using some older Corsair fans in my own case which I've had for years and never had to replace them. Amazon did take the proper steps to correct the issue so... at least since it was still through Amazon there wasn't much hassle getting things straightened out.",

                "reviewText": "I have built several PCs and this case is a great choice for an RGB build or any build. For the price you get 3 Corsair RGB 120mm LL and a controller that you can connect up to 6 Corsair RGB fans. The case is made out of sturdy plastic and temper glass on the front and side to show off your RGB build. The has great airflow, but I recommend buying an additional fan to add to the rear of the case to exhaust the heat. The only con for this case, I wish Corsair included an exhaust fan, but this is common with most case manufacturers. Cable management is good, however, if you use mechanical HD, the HD caddy, will reduce the space to hide cables if you don\u2019t have a modular power supply. In my build I used a modular power supply and M.2 storage so cable management was not an issue. The HD caddy can be removed for more cable management space. Overall, great case for the money considering the RGB fans and controller included with the case.",

                "reviewText": "The case is great except for one thing. More on that later. The quality of the case is excellent. The air flows through well and it looks great. I built the pc with a friend and he was surprised it came with a rgb hub for the fans and a fan speed controller.The one negative is the audio jack at the front of the case is defective. When I plug in headphones partially, like in the picture, I can hear music but at a low volume and low quality. When I plug it in all the way, I hear static. I tried rerouting the wire to avoid other wires but that didn't work.Edit: Changed from 3 to 5 stars. I contacted Corsair about the issue and they sent out a replacement front io with no charge under their warranty. Everything is working perfectly fine.Awesome case for my first build!",

                "reviewText": "Overall, an excellent case.The pros: - cable management is good, and all of the motherboard components fit in easily with enough space for good airflow. easily enough space for the biggest graphics cards. I put in a gigabyte 970, and it has another 4\" to spare.- two HDD trays underneath, next to the power supply- comes with Corsair pro-commander fan/rgb controller pre-installed. The case came without the manual for the pro-commander, so i had to download it.- Case feels sturdy with good steel thickness and no sharp edges.The cons:- The ASUS Aura system and Corsair commander system have some disagreements at the software level that I didn't see before hand- I have a three year old EVGA 750 G2 power supply that required removing the HDD bracket in order to fit in. After installing the PS, I could remount the HDD bracket.- The case has a nice dust filter on top for the air intake, but the rear is open mesh for the expansion ports and rear fan. Would have liked to see mesh for both to help keep dust out.Overall, I am happy with the case. Installation of the motherboard was easy - all hold and stand offs were perfectly placed. The case comes with the three front fans, you have to buy the rear one separately (I would have paid a little more to have it included and pre-mounted). The RGB plug for the cooler master CPU fan didn't fit with the Commander Pro controller; I will need to splice the cable or use the ASUS motherboard controller.",

Auch ist gen\u00fcgend Platz enthalten um diverse Komponenten unterzubringen (Bitte am Ende eure Hardware-Gr\u00f6\u00dfe mit den PC Ma\u00dfen abgleichen). Zus\u00e4tzlich macht es Staubmatte on Top es recht leicht den PC sauber zu halten, da der meiste Staub sich dort oder vorne an dem Filter ansammelt. Dennoch w\u00fcrde ich nat\u00fcrlich empfehlen den Computer regelm\u00e4\u00dfig mal zu entstauben.Und zu guter letzt ist auch der FPS boost durch RGB nicht zu vernachl\u00e4ssigen :D",

                "reviewText": "I decided to upgrade my old gaming PC by getting a new case, rather than a new CPU or GPU due to the current high prices. Obviously, I will be able to keep the case when I eventually upgrade.The case is fantastic. I got the white one to match my interior decor. It really looks great when up-and-running. It's a mid-tower case so it's not too big for a living room, and it looks good enough to have on show rather than hidden away. It's my first RGB case and I couldn't go back to a standard case. The lights look great and the software (iCUE) is easy to use. My old motherboard has no RGB headers but you don't need any since this comes with an RGB controller.The case is very easy to work with. I transferred my motherboard, power supply and graphics card without any problems. The connections for the front panel headers are clearly labelled. The case has great cable management. There are holes all over the place to feed cables where you need them.Please note that the case comes with three RGB intake fans and no exhaust fan (at the rear). To be honest, you don't need one since the airflow with the three front fans is more than adequate. But I did but another Corsair fan for the rear. It made little difference to running temps (a degree or two) but it looks good. :-)I highly recommend the case. It's not cheap but you get what you pay for. Since cases can last you a decade, it's money well spent.",

                "reviewText": "Well I couldn't afford a Obsidian case, but this was the next best thing. It also only has 2 tempered glass panels so if I move, I'm less worried about breaks when I move.I watched Game's Nexus's video review on this case and I have to point out that the case (and it's fans) are virtually silent and that the loudest thing in my case is the stock air cooler for my CPU. That being said top mounting any AIO cooler will be tricky depending on ram and motherboard clearence. There's more than I thought and you MAY be able to get away with a slimmer rad or if you push them to the left (closest to the glass, there's a few different cut outs) but it's likely that you may have to go with a front or single fan rear mounted AIO.Also depending on your form factor, there may not be much space between the PSU shroud and the bottom of the motherboard. In my case there was, a little more than I expected but enough to make me sigh in relief.You will get a rats nest if cables down in the shroud, mostly due to the tight space and the HDD bays (which come with some kinda flimsy sleds, one if mine keeps popping out of place and may be rattling idk yet) but there's still enough space to manage cables in the back, moreso if you're using cable mod cables.Now this case does NOT come with a rear fan. Until my Corsair fan came in for the rear, I had to use a fan I pulled off my old Zalman Z11+ case (not a reccomended case or fan honestly). Oddly however I noticed slightly lower temps with a rear fan than Gamer's Nexus reported in his reviews, but I chalk it up to different build setups, and I will check temps again now that I have the Corsair fan as my rear outflow fan... But honestly, even without a rear fan, taking off the front glass only drops temperatures about 3 or so degrees, not enough to justify leaving it off... If you can get them in there, just get some splitters and fans for rear and top outflows.And yes the dust filters on the top and front are magnetic and easy to remove and boy do they do work.It's a good and roomy little case, just be prepared to clean the glass often, especially when doing work to it.",
