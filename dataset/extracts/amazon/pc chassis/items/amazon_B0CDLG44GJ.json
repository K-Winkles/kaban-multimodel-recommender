Make sure you have a modular and smaller PSU. The only issue i had with this case was one of the legs's screw holes wasn't done correctly. So my case has three legs. You also have to drill through the mesh to get the parts to go where they belong. Overall it's a good value. Works as intended. Love being able to carry the case with the handle.",

                "reviewText": "Just so people are aware, the marketing visual illustrations are not the best for part fitment. It will in fact fit an matx board and an atx psu in a sub 15L case with decent gpu clearance. I'd recommend a fully modular 140mm psu with short cables if you run ATX, and depending on how your cables route, the GPU can be closer to 290mm without hitting anything. I feel like this is really the sweet spot for SFF builds with matx boards. It really maximizes possibilities without being too expensive, yet easily small enough to put some ITX cases to shame. There is still plenty of room for different GPU sizes as well. I plan on doing more with the case and eventually will go crazier, but this was a cheap case I wanted to try with old PC parts and I'm really pleased with how it turned out.If I were to improve on the design, in my opinion the motherboard is mounted a tad too high. You could easily drop it a few millimeters to create more gpu clearance from the psu cables, and it would likely help with making even 120 fans fit up top rather easily. This would lead to the other problem of the power cable location. It's really just in the way of potential fan mounting as well. It could easily be moved down about an inch and still be just above the rear exhaust fan. This would clear any space needed at the top of the case. Lastly, I thought the feet on this case were a bit ugly. Functionally they add more height for air to act as intake, but I really just thought they were too high.I would definitely recommend this case to those who want to downsize some without going all out ITX SFF. It's not the most challenging case to build in at all. There is no removable back panel on this case, so just make sure you run cables you want to hide behind the MB, and just plan accordingly for the parts you have.",

                "reviewText": "First, the only pro : it's very small for a micro atx case, and light weight.Cons - very cramped work area.-no hiding cables in a clear side case-dust filters aren't correct sizes, don't have magnets, don't have cut outs for feet, or handle.-vent holes have poor spacing for poor airflow, add the dust filters and it chokes.-no rubber on tg holes, so screws could crack or shatter your glass if you aren't very careful on install-on tg panel, nowhere for it to sit while mounting or opening side panel.Case overall feels super cheap for just being a box with a panel. Really unfortunate but maybe a dollar in components and design changes and this could've been a great case. Still if you're creative and don't mind some hard work it is a small enclosure with a handle for matx",

                "reviewText": "The case is no frills. Simple but well built. The rear panel does not come off so make sure your CPU cooler is assembled and fitted before you put in the motherboard. Also the rear fan is 92mm depending on you gpu thickness you can put 2 120mm fans on the bottom of the case but the top won't because the power passthrough for the power supply goes right over the top. ASRock steel legen 6650xt, gigabyte rx7600, and a EVGA 3070 ti all fit while using a sfx power supply. I gave it 4 stars because of the top fans and no rear panel access.",

Aesthetic is good, not sure how else you could do cable management hiding in a case this tightly packed. Pretty much perfect, my only complaint would be if they could use some type of higher quality heavier metal to make it feel more premium and durable?",

                "reviewText": "The case looks fine and seems to be well-built. The problem is in the details of the design choices. I'll cover the 3 that I encountered before I made up my mind to return the case, but you may see others if you get further than I did. First thing I noticed was no rubber gaskets around the glass side panel. This means the glass will be sandwiched between two pieces of metal. Overtightening the screws could easily lead to broken glass. Second red flag I encountered was that the mobo standoffs are welded to the back panel, meaning you can't reposition them. This resulted in one of the standoffs touching the edge of my mobo, which just feels like a short waiting to happen. The last strike was that the PSU bracket just simply won't fit an ATX power supply, and there appears to be no method for attaching said PSU without it. I didn't even get around to installing a hard drive, but the instructions make it look like we're just suppose to stack them like books below the PSU? How is that suppose to work?It's a shame because the case looks good and is a unique size w/ unique features (the handle, for example). If they were better about the details of the actual build, it would be a home run. Alas...I'm returning and will keep shopping.",
