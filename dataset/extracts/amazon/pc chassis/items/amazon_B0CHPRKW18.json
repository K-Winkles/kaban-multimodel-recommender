Im using a Micro ATX board and everything fits well on the inside. 1 standoff that you screw in is a couple milimeters out of place (bottom right of board) but all the others are good. To utilize a full length advertised card you have to either cut the case or remove the CPU cooler before and after installing. I was using a smaller card but then upgraded and ended up cutting the case for conevience. Looks fine with the panels installed. I would prefer the front panel and supports screw appart to alleviate this issue, but for the price I wasnt concerned about cutting it myself.I placed my docked nintendo switch in the photos for a size comparison.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase and would buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "This case is really wonderful for $33. Just keep in mind it has a limited amount of space. So you need to mind your cabling, and make sure that your GPU is short enough. A large GPU isn't going to fit. The largest you're going to fit in there and still have room for a fan is probably about 220mm, and that's if it's not too tall to fit in the front of the case where the fans mount. I would stick to something less than about 210mm if you want to have a good time with this case.I have seen some people complain about the cooling in this case. I would agree that it's not really optimized for great cooling, but you can mount two 120mm fans in the front and an 80mm in the back. With the power supply fan as well that should give you enough cooling for anything you could reasonably stuff in this case. If you're going to put a high end computer together that sucks down a lot of power, then don't put it in a $33 case.The only real critique I have of the case is that it looks more like a pistachio on the item page and when it got here it looks really like a robin egg blue. Also there may be a sharp edge or two where you may not expect it, like on the outside corner of the case. I had to hammer that down with the handle of a screwdriver.I put a Ryzen 5 4600G and a GTX 1660 super in it and it runs great. Really glad I purchased this. I actually bought two of these cases because I like them so much for the price. Like I said, if you keep the cases limitations in mind, you will be just as satisfied as I am.",

                "reviewText": "This is designed so that a mATX motherboard -just- fits. This is not a problem. I really like the small size.And there's still room and mounting holes for a couple of 2.5\" SSDs or even 3.5\" hard drives, which mount via one edge of the drive only, but this might be enough for you, and will be enough for most people. Modern motherboards have at least one M.2 slot for on-board boot SSD drive anyway.It comes with many standoffs permanently installed and a couple of additional ones that screw-in.The issue I had is that the one screw-in standoff I used did not line up with a hole in the motherboard, which I am 100 percent positive had the holes in the right place - I've used the same model board in many different cases before.So with a pair of pliers, I bent the standoff in the case in the correct direction - probably about 1/16 inch - until the motherboard hole lined up. This works fine, but it left a wrinkle in the sheet metal on the outside of the case.Cosmetically not a big issue for me, but if you need to do this, you will notice it on the outside. Five stars except for this. You could also not install the standoff or install it but not the screw. I chose to make the screw fit.BTW the case does not have a USB 3.x port or connector by the power button panel - there are 2 USB 2.x ports. No stars removed for this. Most motherboards today have plenty of those on the back. Also, don't expect to put a BIG power supply in there. IMO a 400-500 watt supply should be plenty these days for just about anything you'll put in this case, but your mileage will vary.",

                "reviewText": "Love the case for it's size and simplicity. I was able to fit a mATX motherboard and a GTX1060 with some creativity running the cables. Use a SFX PSU if you're building on this. You need all the space you can find. I was only able to install one front fan due to the MB power cable in the way for the second one so look at your motherboard connections before buying. I'm getting <50C on CPU temp and <72 on GPU on full load with only one front fan and a 90mm Jonsbo CPU cooler. Will buy another one for my son but will use an iTX which i'm sure will fit better.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking forward to this case based on the reviews. Unfortunately it didn't work for my mATX motherboard. I would've had to bend the mobo quite a bit to get the screws to fit. The Issue was the IO cutout was inaccurate. Even if I didn't use the IO shield it still looked sketchy. I learned the standoffs in the case I received were not removable either so it appears the manufacturing changed from the reviews I based my order on.",
