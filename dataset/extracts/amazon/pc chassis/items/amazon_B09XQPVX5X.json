But I don't know if the one with the delay is the HWINFO software or the CPU Cooler display.(BTW I recorded this while running VR Chat on a valve index, and the CPU is a 13700KF.)Others are complaining that it shows random temperatures. You need to have it connected correctly to the motherboard and you need to have the software/drivers for this cooler installed.This Cooler has good and bright ARGB lights but the motherboard you have, could be limiting it's LED functionality. I have an ASRock motherboard with polychrome sync and there are not that many modes that I can choose from.If there was a software or an external controller with a button or something to help those with bad motherboards, that would make this product even better.",

                "reviewText": "First off, this cooler has one of the best esthetics out there with just the right amount of leds in the right places for my taste. If you are building comp where you can see the components, obviously you want it to look cool. It also does a great job of cooling for and works will with my ROG Strix B550-F. It is crowding 1 of the 4 rams slots, but I am only running 2 16gig sticks so there was plenty of room for me. I chose not to install the software that displays accurate temperatures since I already have monitoring and would be doing so just for the display. The sticker is slightly off center, but I can pull it off and re-center if it truly bothers me later.I did have my first one screw up and the fan cracked on the hub, which deteriorated rapidly to the point I had to remove the unit and replace it with my Wraith so that I could continue to work. It was past the 30 day point too, so I really didnt expect much when I contacted the seller about it. To my delight, they responded quickly, asked for a picture of the broken fan and then sent me a replacement at lighting speed! Ive had the replacement for a few months now and it has been awesome with no issues.All in all, its a great product at a fair price and excellent support. I would not hesitate to purchase again.",

I love the temperature display (you have to download additional software to use) and the RGB is great also, but one of the fans on my unit is not mounted properly in the assembly which causes it to rub against the fan case. At low speeds it is not a big deal, but when the rpm's rise, it steadily gets louder and more annoying. I put a lot of money into upgrading my computer and should not have skimped on the fan. I guess this is just a good excuse to get a watercooler.",

Also included was a nice big tube of thermal paste with a spreader(spatula).It looks amazing but please beware and make sure your pc case will have enough room for this beast. You'll have to download software to get the sensor to read out anything different than the 24\u00b0 it says by default but that was pretty easy to do. One minor complaint is the temperature it displays is usually about 6\u00b0 lower than the cpu temp being reported by the actual pc. That is a minor flaw but whatever it says on the display just add around 6\u00b0 and it'll still be nice and cool. Very nice cooler. I'd definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Great product. You have to read and follow all the instructions. Others say it just reads 24 degrees all the time. On the last page of the instructions it requests you to download the operating software and then it will give proper readings. I did that and then it is working fine. There is also 4 wires to connect up. I am very happy with it. Looks better than Cooler Master which is a very good product.",

                "reviewTitle": "Works well but temp guage doesnt work.",
                "reviewText": "I actually was impressed with this cooler paired with my Intel 12700KF. was kind of disapointed that the temp gauge didn't actually work. The page i ordered this from says i needed a program from their website to make it work or else it would only read 24\u00b0c (which it did) I installed the app it told me to install and it then it only reads 99\u00b0c.... my Asus software tells me it was at 5\u00b0c for first 5 min on idle then remains at 28-35 after a slight work load for 10 mins and back to idle. And under a benchmark test it peaked at 62\u00b0c 3 times in a row with the Asus extream overclock setting set. then back down to 30-33\u00b0c when test ended in 4 seconds. Pretty impressive imo. Cpu Chip got a 22176 rating on Cinabench for multithreading. all in all cooler looks nice with the ARGB lighing controlled with the mobo and works way better then expected for heat dissipation. The only down fall for me was temp gauge is pointless and completely inaccurate. This cooler was super easy to install (For me), i really had no issues with it and didn't even need to use the instructions hardly. It is a very heavy cooler just so you are aware, but it seems to sit in the case nice and snug. The ram i chose would not allow for me to fit 4 sticks in but some of the smaller may fit. I used Arctic thermal past instead of what it came with because i had a large tube of it already open, unsure if this made any sort of difference but it is possible i guess. I would only recommend this cooler to people for its looks, if you want an accurate temp gauge and that's a big deal for you get something else. Ill probably pull this out and swap it out for an Arctic Freezer 50 3 fan in the not too distant future.EDIT:Been reading some of the reviews that have popped up since i purchased and since i got the PC all up and running. Sadly, my last part was my power supply and took too long for any sort of return to be available for this component in my case. When it arrived it was not boxed in any way like most amazon purchases i got in past but non the lest was was sealed in film wrap and box was in great shape. (forgot to mention that before as i seen some people arrived in poor condition) PC has been running more or less non store for a few weeks now with 0 issues yet. Fingers crossed until i can afford some changes. I guess i wasn't too descriptive, Ive installed many coolers in past so this was pretty straight forward for me and it was similar to one other i used a few years back (where i had to remove a face plate to access 2 screw down points) I'm still sort of torn as this cooler ARGB looks wonderful with most of my build minus the case RGB fans and LED.. that's an easy fix to make correct and doesn't have anything to do with the cooler itself. Seems some people have got lemons in the mail and for you i feel terrible, i was very lucky to get a good specimen. it will do fine until i can A) Decide what i want instead and B) save up to get something else.ReEdit:Ouf tried a hard temp test program and this did not perform well at all!!!! hit 88\u00b0c ouch but that's an extreme testing program called Prime85 which i don't trying recommend with this thing. i had to know though. didn't wanna cool down till i restarted PC too. not good.",
