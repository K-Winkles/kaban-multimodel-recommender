                "reviewText": "I really want to love this product as it is nicely made and looks great. However this product has a major design flaw that made the air circulation terrible. The case has openings at the bottom and side. However the bottom holes are completely covered by the motherboard itself. Hence the circulation is terrible! 15 minutes of use, the whole case felt like burning hot. I understand having holes on the top panel is ugly, however a simple solution would be mounting the mother board upside down, in that way air flow can come on from the bottom holes and go out on the side. Another issue is that this case can\u2019t mount a 3.5 inch hard drive as long as you have desktop memories. This was really unclear to me because I thought the limitation was on the cooler height. Also the side panel USB ports are 2.0 not 3.0. This is also misleading on the description.",
