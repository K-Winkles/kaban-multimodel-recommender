The problem is with the overall width with rack ears installed being slightly over 19\". I had to take approximately .020 off each rack ear for them to mount flush inside my rack. The height was fine, it screwed to the rack okay. Just the width was slightly over the 19\" EIA-310 rack spec. I contacted support. The support person seemed like he didn't have a clue. Poor quality control. Other than that it's pretty good case.",
