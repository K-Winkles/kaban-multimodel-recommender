                "reviewText": "For my next water cooled build I had a task to find the most compact case that can house hardware I already have:- Two 360mm radiators with standard 25mm fans- ATX motherboard- Full-size ATX power supplyBut surprisingly, it was a challenge. There are plenty of options when you must \"pick 2 from 3\", like 2 rads, but SFX PSU or downsize to mATX motherboard, etc. Mesh-7c satisfied all three in compact size.The first impression was very positive. I got compact, premium-looking, full metal, lightweight but sturdy case with tempered glass panel for reasonable price.Then I tried to fit different components of my future build. Main concern was that my radiators are much wider than usual (133 vs 120 mm), but I had no issues installing them at all. Push-pull configuration at the bottom is also possible as there is enough space under the PSU.There are two designated places for pump mounting. One on the bottom and one on the PSU basket. I was able to fit D5 with no issues and potentially could put reservoir as well. With shorter video card and DDC pump you will have more options, like mounting to the one of bottom fans.Case feet are tall enough, giving almost 1inch from a surface that should help a lot for getting air from the bottom.Cable management is good - plenty of space at the back to hide cables, splitters, controllers, etc. There are zip ties included, but it would be good to get couple of reusable ties as well.As for the fan support for air cooled build, it is possible to put up to 3x140mm at the top (officially it is only 2x140). But be aware that you need mATX motherboard to put 140mm fans at the bottom.To summarize, it is well-engineered, high-quality case with great balance between size and flexibility that can house top hardware and cool it respectively so you can get powerful, quiet, and attractively looking rig on your table.",

                "reviewText": "I brought this case for my first build. I like the very clean and simple look, not too gaming vibe, but still big glass window for the \u201cview\u201d.Pro:- Easy installation, no screw- Build quality is pretty good, solid metal case and durable glass panel.- Quiet- Easy to arrange the cables.- Vertical airflow design, make the RGB fans very appealing. Cons:- I found the ARGB fan come with the case not working well, the ARGB light was not lit up for most of the time. The customer service team promised to provide a replacement, I will update if that happened. But I replaced with an other brand fan, works perfectly.- the power cable is a bit thin, this is the cable that connect the back power socket to your PSU at the front. I am a bit worried about the quality, no specs for this cable found in the case.Give its price range, I think it\u2019s a great value for my $780 game machine!Fit:Ryzen 5600x3D / Asus Tuf Gaming b550 plus WIFI II / Asrock Rex 6750XT Challenger Pro / Gskill 2 X 8G DDR4 / Thermalright ARGB case fan x 5",

                "reviewText": "I got this case as it makes a standard ATX computer build shorter and more compact. I was looking around for what I had as my ATX Case I had, the tempered glass broke in my hand one day while installing it after making some fan installs. I then compared the size to my XPS 8950 and was like, this big boy is too tall. I came across this case and checked out the dimensions and it is almost as small as my XPS case and this one fits a full ATX board inside.The case also has a USB-C connector in the front of the case. Which many others did not. It also included one RGB Fan. So I ordered it along side new case fans and a new power supply. Installation of the power supply is easy and went by smooth.Adding motherboard risers was easy enough and the thread seemed to be done well. Fan installation for chassis fans was also easy and straight forward. I ended up removing the front cover just to ensure that all my cables were not touching anything and that could be seen. That is when while snapping the front piece on I heard a click and something fall.I didn't think much of it and went on with my day. I then ordered some other parts for m PC and was checking again after removing the front panel. That is when I noticed that one of the clips had broken off. I take care of my things and go extra careful after ensuring that they align. This is not my first case I've built either with clips on the front.That was disappointing, sure it still holds but one clip breaking that easy seemed to be bad so far. The video shows the tech taking off the panel with force. Something I did not do while taking it off or putting it back in as to not damage the front USB connectors or power button. The case is well made and maybe that plastic piece was defective.This houses a 2080 and I7 8700K and it is like the machine is not even on. Love the front mesh is see thru and I can see the RGB of the power supply I use.",
