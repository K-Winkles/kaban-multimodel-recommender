                "reviewText": "In the picture you can see our house is extremely dusty (3 air purifiers active and we vacuum, mop and dust daily) as we are in Southwest NM with two dogs awaiting cedar mulch. The case hasn\u2019t let ANY dust in after 5 days of heavy use. I vacuum out the front vents when I vacuum the house and it\u2019s effortless from there. My old case was a Thor v2, it was massive and had amazing airflow, but I wanted something more compact and visually pleasing. For the money this thing is perfect.Pros: CLEAN and stays that way with minimal care. Easy to build, I mean painless. Majority of cables already tied down, all I had to do was run PSU cables, plug in case wires, and plug in Satas. Took me an hour to build this thing. Plenty of room for a massive cpu cooler and a huge GPU. Magnetic filter on top is a wonderful touch too!Con (yes only one): I had to install a 140mm fan on the top pulling air out of the case, this was largely to blame on my cpu cooler and GPU\u2019s close proximity. That being said one fan fixed all of my problems, I\u2019m running a 10900k and a 1080ti and neither run very hot with no AC hooked up yet. Cpu average:80-85c GPU: 71-75c",

I love how easy it was to get my build set up, and the room left over after using a full ATX motherboard and GPU was great.Only two things I would say are bad about this case, and that's why I'm leaving 4 stars instead of 5. No included 3.5\" trays. I just spent $73 on this case, and they couldn't include at least one tray? So now I'll have to figure out which tray will fit and spend even more money to add it. Second, the triangle shaped \"Tempered Glass\" sticker was applied directly to the glass. It's not a vinyl peel off, it's a full blown sticker, so after getting done with my build, I spent almost 15 minutes with a Razer and nail polish remover to get the left over sticky crap off the glass.",
