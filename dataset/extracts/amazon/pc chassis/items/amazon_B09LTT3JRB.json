                "reviewText": "I recently got a Desktop Computer Power Switch Power Supply Cable for my wall-mounted PC setup, and it's turned out to be a neat little addition. This cable is a game-changer if you're looking to add a hidden or more accessible power button to your system.The main appeal of this cable is the flexibility it offers in terms of where you can place your PC's power button. For my wall-mounted setup, I wanted to keep the look clean and uncluttered, and this cable allowed me to discreetly place the power button in a more convenient location. It's like having a secret switch, which is not only practical but also adds a cool factor to the setup.The quality of the cable and switch is solid. It was easy to install, connecting seamlessly with my motherboard. The length of the cable is adequate for most setups, offering enough reach to place the switch in a variety of locations.In terms of performance, the switch works reliably, and I haven't encountered any issues with it. It's a straightforward tool but does its job perfectly, allowing me to power up or reset my computer without having to reach for the main unit.In summary, the Desktop Computer Power Switch Power Supply Cable is a simple yet effective solution for those who have custom PC setups like wall mounts and want to add a bit of convenience and flair. If you're looking for a way to hide your power button or just want it in a more accessible spot, this product is definitely worth considering.",

Does just that. I'm not the pc expert. My hubby is. But he said it was easy to install. And he even used the extra piece it came with to make it so both the extended button and the button on the tower are operational. I love it. I plan to use the double sided sticky it comes with to mount the plug under my desk. It's gonna be great when it's done. If I can remember to come back, I'll add pics later.",
