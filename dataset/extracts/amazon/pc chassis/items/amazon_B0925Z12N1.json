                "reviewText": "This case is outstanding for a small ITX build. The case is the size of a traditional audio receiver, and it has room for a mini-itx board and SFX PSU. I put the Asrock A520M-ITX/ac board in it with 32GB RAM and a Ryzen 7 5700G. I had to update the BIOS on the board before it would recognize the processor, but otherwise was a great build. I am using an NVME drive, so the 4x 2.5\" drive bay is not installed. If it were, it would be a tight fit with my EVGA SuperNOVA 450 GM PSU (which has modular cabling). The positioning of the PSU and the motherboard power connectors was ideal for the short modular cables that come with that power supply.I am very happy with the space and the vents in this case. Overall, this is a great case for a small system.",

                "reviewText": "Was nice to build in. Overall I really like it. Provided m.2 screw was too small and didn't secure my drive well enough. I also was able to fit a slightly bigger PSU in it but sacrificed the drive cages. If you're looking for a smaller build chassis, I'd say give this one a go.",
