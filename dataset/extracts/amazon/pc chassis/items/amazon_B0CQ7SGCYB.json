                "reviewText": "The Antec Performance 1 FT is a mid-tower computer case that offers a balanced combination of features and performance. In this unbiased review, we'll delve into its various aspects to provide you with a comprehensive overview.**Design and Build Quality (4/5):** The Performance 1 FT features a minimalistic design with a brushed aluminum front panel that gives it a premium appearance. The case is well-constructed and feels sturdy, which is a positive aspect in terms of build quality. However, some users may prefer a more flashy design, and the overall aesthetic may not appeal to everyone.**Airflow and Cooling (4.5/5):** This case is equipped with multiple cooling options, including support for up to six 120mm or four 140mm fans. It also offers compatibility with liquid cooling solutions, making it a good choice for those who want to keep their system cool, even during heavy workloads. The airflow design is efficient, and cable management options are decent, allowing for clean airflow paths.**Compatibility (4/5):** The Performance 1 FT supports ATX, micro-ATX, and mini-ITX motherboards, offering versatility in terms of motherboard compatibility. It can accommodate graphics cards up to 370mm in length and CPU coolers up to 165mm in height, which should cover the majority of user requirements. However, some larger graphics cards or CPU coolers may not fit.**Storage Options (4/5):** This case provides a good number of storage options with support for up to four 2.5\" SSDs and two 3.5\" HDDs. This should be sufficient for most users, but it's worth noting that the drive bays aren't tool-free, which might be a minor inconvenience for some.**Ease of Installation (4/5):** The Performance 1 FT offers a relatively straightforward installation process with well-labeled cable routing channels and plenty of cable management options. However, it lacks some premium features like a removable motherboard tray, which could make the installation process even more user-friendly.**Price and Value (4/5):** The price point of the Antec Performance 1 FT is reasonable, given its build quality, cooling options, and compatibility. While it may not be the cheapest case on the market, it strikes a good balance between quality and affordability.**Conclusion:**The Antec Performance 1 FT is a well-constructed mid-tower case with a minimalist design that might not appeal to users looking for more flashy aesthetics. It excels in terms of airflow and cooling options, making it a suitable choice for users who prioritize thermal performance. The case offers good compatibility for most standard components, but it may not accommodate larger components. The price is reasonable, considering the features and build quality it offers.Ultimately, the Antec Performance 1 FT is a solid choice for users looking for a reliable, mid-range computer case, provided that the design and size constraints align with their preferences and requirements.",

                "reviewText": "Bought the Antec Performance 1 case just before the Black Friday deals and had I not been so impatient could\u2019ve saved another $30 but let me tell you, it was worth every penny of the $145 that I spent! Excellent materials used in its construction. It\u2019s a beautiful and well thought out design that performs just as good as it looks.AMD Ryzen 7900xSapphire Nitro+ 7900XTX32GB TeamGroup TFORCE 6400MT CL32ASUS ROG Strix B650E-FCooler Master 360L Illusion AIOThe case was a dream to build in. There is soooo much space. The top panels are completely removable so motherboard and AIO installation was a breeze. High quality rubber grommets line the chassis pass throughs and the openings at the top for PCI-E cables were large and easy to use. The left panel is dedicated to cable management. Triple channel cableways (2 front 1 rear) give a clear guide for wires to be run and multiple hook and loop Velcro tie downs are included. Another big plus is there are captive screws (thumb screws) everywhere you would want them to secure things in place. You almost don\u2019t need a screwdriver at all! Then you have two paint matched covers that hide the majority of your wires for a clean finish. Two tempered glass covers line both sides of the case. It\u2019s nice, but it does make for a heavy rig so make sure you\u2019re placing it on a desk that\u2019s solid and sturdy because it\u2019s enough weight to destabilize anything flimsy. The main chamber is large and cavernous so it\u2019s not often you can\u2019t manage to grab something or hook up those more tedious items like USB, HD audio and front panel cables. I\u2019m positive this case will eat a 4090 for lunch and run two 360 AIO\u2019s simultaneously!The part of the case that I probably over looked the most but I was very impressed with was the included fans. This is where a lot of the value comes into play. Some cases of this caliber don\u2019t include fans and especially if you want RGB, you\u2019re going to pay for that after you buy the case. It comes with 3 140mm fans in the front and 1, 120mm in the rear exhaust section. All of these fans have a 30mm depth and they move A lOT of air!! They aren\u2019t RGB but honestly you could get away with not running any as the case is just that nice. You\u2019ll definitely need to adjust fan curves in the bios if you want a good balance of cooling and low noise otherwise they can get noticeably loud at the higher rpm\u2019s. It\u2019s recommended to setup up a positive static pressure in the case as there are a lot of areas where dust will make its way in and accumulate on your hardware if you don\u2019t.Overall I am very very pleased with the product both functionally and aesthetically and I would recommend it to anyone that wants a high quality case at a fair price. If you take care of your things this case will easily last you 3-4 years down the road, multiple upgrades and full builds. Antec built a winner here and if you buy it you will not be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "Very very pleased with this case. The power supply installs from the rear and slides out easily with only 2 thumb screws, which is a feature I really like. Included grommets for cable routing and cable ties are also a great inclusion. The included fans seem to be good quality and they are fairly quiet in my opinion. Plenty of space above the motherboard to easily install a radiator, installed a 240mm very easily. Airflow is great, and the included dust filters are very nice, especially the front filter. Great case at a great price, 10/10.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, fabulous case. Looks awesome, pretty easy to build. Really great value. Glad to see Antec is \"back\" in the case market.The so-so: I found it difficult to access the PSU plugs and deal with cabling in the lower section. Your sequence of install will be very important. The upshot is you do end up with a nice clean build once it's done.The bad: my case didn't include the hardware required to mount the SSDs behind the motherboard where intended. I didn't bother asking Antec to supply them, I just mounted one in the PSU enclosure instead.",

Il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme grande tour juste parce qu'il peut prendre des cartes m\u00e8re e-atx.Et le seul point n\u00e9gatif que j'aurais \u00e0 dire c'est que si vous voulez mettre des ventilos dans le bas, \u00e7a prend des vis longues (ceux qu'on utilise pour fix\u00e9 les ventilos sur les rad d'AIO) et Antec ne les fournis pas",
