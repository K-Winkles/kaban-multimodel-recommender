                "reviewText": "Bought this to build a NAS running Unraid since an 8 bay NAS from Synology was far more expensive than just building my own. It is a small for factor case so if you're not used to building in ITX cases it can be a bit cramped, but more than doable. The manual isn't very helpful when installing the PSU so pay attention to how and when you route the power cable.The only downside of this case I have found are the stock fans. They are super loud so if you have this case on your desk, or in an area in your house you'll hear the fans all the time. The stock fans are 100mm according to Jonsbo. I was able to replace them with a pair of Noctua 92mm fans. They mount just fine and the included fan grills work as well. Using the low noise adapters that come with the Noctua fans they are barely audible. Chances are your HDDs are louder. Max temps I see on the drives are never past 28c, which is ideal!Love this case and as of now if really seems to be best and smallest form factor case that also supports 8 HDDs AND a spot for an SSD cache. Loving the setup and my wallet is happy I went this route instead of the Synology setup I was looking at.",

                "reviewText": "Love this case. It's highly compact but I was able to get everything to fit properly. Just make sure you are using the proper sized power supply. It takes 2 4-pin molex power connectors and 1 SATA power for powering the drive board. I'm running an i5-12600k, 32GB RAM, and 8 drives. The drives are running at around 27-32 degrees at idle with the case housed in a pretty enclosed area, and I also don't have any extra fans in the upper section of the case yet (they aren't included). I'll be using it as a file server as well as occasional daily driver and I appreciate the front audio and USB-C connections. Could be a little cheaper but I get that it's basically an niche import at this point.",

                "reviewText": "Finding a SFF case for a DIY NAS isn\u2019t as easy as I thought it\u2019d be when I decided to build my own instead of buying something like a Synology. There are really only a few options and this one was by far the most aesthetic, in my opinion. That said, it took way more planning than any build I\u2019ve attempted in the past. ITX is not ideal for large storage options due to limited SATA ports as well as a single PCI-E slot on the vast majority of ITX motherboards. Because of this, you really need to plan your build around your priorities and be willing to make some sacrifices. For example, I had to really hunt for a motherboard that had onboard 10GBE as well as enough SATA ports for 8 drives to run at full capacity without sacrificing the NVME or PCI-E slots. I found exactly 1 lol.Regardless, once you do nail down your plans, this is a great case that allows you to slam a decently sized GPU and CPU cooler in it without too much hassle (RTX 3050 and Noctua NH-U9S is what I\u2019m running with room to spare).That said, I\u2019m knocking a star off for 2 reasons:1) I *hate* the rubber handles on the HDD drives. They\u2019re sloppy and loose and make it an absolute chore to get your drives out2) The PSU you can use is very restrictive. I went with a Corsair SF750 only after realizing the SF850 (which is cheaper and more readily available) was a few mm too long. This is because it\u2019s mounted very oddly in the case that forces you to run an extension cable out the back rather than plugging in directly to the PSU. Consequently, this means you can\u2019t access the power switch directly when the case is buttoned up. It\u2019s pretty annoying when first building and testing but not as bad once you\u2019re ready to set it and forget it.All and all I do recommend this to anyone looking for a good looking SFF NAS. Just be ready for its quirks.",

                "reviewText": "Very large form factor with flimsy rubber bands that attach to your disk drives. For such an expensive case you would think they would actually give you more than rubber bands for drive trays. Well that and the non standard 100mm fans that come with the case scream like banshees. It\u2019s nearly impossible to find replacement fans of these dimensions.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I'm happy with the case for what it is. I built a NAS system in it to replace a Synology.I put the following parts in and have not had issues with mounting / fit:Intel 13500 CPU with Noctua NH-L9x65 cooler (you can go taller than this for extra cooling)Asus Strix B760-i MotherboardCorsair SF750 PSU6x12TB WD Red Plus DrivesLSI 9207-8i HBASwapped the stock case fans for Noctua 92mm NF-A9 PWM fans connected to the motherboard for speed control. I put one additional Noctua 80mm PWM fan at the back of the case (It supports up to 2 fans there).Idle the 13500 sits around 28C with 71F ambient (21.6C). I do have the CPU in Eco mode in the BIOS. Under load the CPU has hit 72C max, but usually hangs in the 50's for most tasks. I have the hard drive fans running about 50% constantly and the drives idle around 36C, 42C under load. Even at these speeds the fans are very quiet with more headroom for cooling. Running TrueNAS Scale everything works perfectly.You will need an extra-long screwdriver to install a power supply in this case. It attaches to a bracket that mounts to the case with 4 screws. Check YouTube for videos on builds beforehand to get an idea and to plan out a build strategy. For the price I wish the hard drive mounting setup was flushed out a little more. It involves you installing rubber gromets to the side of the drive and sliding them into the case. A rubber handle is installed to let you pull the drives out. Drive trays would have been preferred here.",
