                "reviewText": "This is the easiest and most spacious case I've built a computer in. It doesn't look too big from the outside, but it has ample space for cable management and accessories and it feels very solid. There's a fair amount of space above and below the motherboard, making it easy to access the screws and plug in cables. The massive cable cutout next to the motherboard is very nice too. It has ventilation on all sides with a filter on the top and bottom and I can immediately tell that it has much better airflow than my old case, partly thanks to the 6 included fans (my old case had 4).The included RGB fans look great behind the tempered glass. The fan controller is nice (supports 10 aRGB fans + 2 RGB accessories), although it uses 6 pin fans and the speed can only be controlled by the remote control (as far as I can tell). It does support a hardware switch to change colors, but that isn't included (you could wire the reset switch to be the color selector instead). There is also a motherboard sync port which seems to be a 3 pin RGB input for color control, but again, the cable isn't included. The 2 led accessory ports seem to be standard 5V RGB headers, but you need small RGB to standard RGB adapters.The accessory bag is pretty nice, it has an assortment of different screws, including radiator screws, along with a buzzer, and blank expansion plate. I wish it included the RGB adapters for the fan controller because they're somewhat hard to come by, but I was glad to see so much variety in the included parts.Finally, the case comes with no documentation and there doesn't seem to be a manual online either. It's fairly straightforward, but it was a little hard to tell what screws are meant for what, and there are no details about the features on the fan controller.Overall, for the case, plus 6 aRGB fans and a 10+2 fan controller, it's an amazing deal. While I wish it came with a manual, I'm very happy with the purchase and would definitely buy it again",

                "reviewText": "This case has a ton of value for the price. If you can get it for less than $60, it's a steal, especially for a case with side and front tempered glass panels. Lots of fan mounting options (9x 120mm fans) with mesh filters on top and bottom. Thumb screws for the side panels, and hinges for the glass panel. Excellent front I/O availability and placement. Fits a Coolermaster 212 CPU cooler (160mm). This case is functional while looking great at the same time. The only con I could think of is the front panel airflow if you use it for intake. There is <1cm gap (see photo) between the case and the front glass panel so airflow is quite restricted. Under load, internal temps (Ryzen 3600 + RX 5700) were 60-70\u00b0C with front panel on. With front panel off, it was about 15-20\u00b0C less. Personally, I just keep the front panel on and the side panel unscrewed, and when temps get high I swing open the side panel for better airflow. Overall, a great case for the price!",

It was an absolute STEAL for how nice it is and the fans and controller it comes with!This case comes with SIX fans attached to an ARGB fan controller. There are 3 ways to control the lighting:1: Use the included remote to cycle colours and presets.2: Connect a button to the 2-pin connector to cycle through presets. This is not included, but you can easily attach the case's \"RESET\" button to this connector and use it to cycle.3: Connect the fan controller to one of your your motherboards ARGB headers. Many people have been confused about how to do this, so let me explain:The case does does not come with a cable for this, but I was able to contact Bbears and they sent me one for the cost of shipping. It's a proprietary 3-pin cable to ARGB adapter. Simply connect this between the \"motherboard sync\" connector on the fan controller and any ARGB header on your motherboard. Then, tap the \"On\" button on the remote to switch it from presets to motherboard control of the fan lighting.The presets look beautiful on their own unless you have other lighted components you need to sync with. The photos and video in this review are using schemes I made using OpenRGB and AuraCreatorThe fans must be connected to the included fan controller. They do not have standard fan and RGB headers.",

I think it has some small surprises, for instance the grommets are well-placed. Paint quality is more than sufficient. I put in a full ATX board and there is plenty of space to put in a liquid cooler with three fans. The assembly was a bit tricky here and there, it is because I do not have a modular power supply. I would definitely recommend this case, if you like to look inside the computer. There is plenty of airflow as the front plate sits about 5mm away from the case. Yup, glad I put this together.Pro: Easy to assemble and build inCons: none so far.Edit: small update, I grabbed a bigger modular PSU and I just wish I could remove the disk cage without a drill (which I do not have).Still very pleased with the case, just need to learn cable management.",
