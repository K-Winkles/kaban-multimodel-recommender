                "reviewText": "Just a perfect fit for my first HTPC build. A friend of mine wanted a me to construct a PC to hook up to their TV. I decided to see how small a build I could do that fit their needs.Needed a through-hole for both a DC barrel jack (Pico PSU) and two through-holes for external wireless antennas. Bonus points if it could fit and be cooled by a stock Intel cooling fan (LGA 1150). I had no desire to do case modifications.Specifications:Intel Pentium Processor G3260 (Haswell)BIOSTAR Hi-Fi B85N version 2Timetec Hynix IC 16GB KIT (2x8GB) DDR3L 1600MHz (runs at 1333MHz due to processor limitations)Team Group GX2 2.5\" 1TB SATA III (got on sale, good enough for HTPC)7260HMW Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 mPCIE (had to move jumper on motherboard to change from mSATA to mPCIE)2 x 8dBi Wi-Fi RP-SMA Male Antenna Dual Band 2.4GHz/5.8GHzRGEEK 24pin DC ATX PSU 12V DC Input 250W Pico PSUALITOVE AC 100-240V to DC 12V 10A Power Supply Adapter (it works, but I still have concerns about it flaking later on).Windows 10 Pro x64No instructions, although with plenty of extra screws included it evens out.Case was a perfect fit for all these parts. Although if I using a 3.5\" drive a new CPU fan would have been required because the stock Intel one is a bit to tall with HDD mount in place. Cable management was a breeze to implement case headers, SATA cable, and 8 pin CPU connector run behind Pico PSU for a clean/organized look inside. Pico PSU doesn't interfere with any I/O or component usage on the motherboard. All front I/O worked flawlessly. Had to buy longer (30cm) u.FL to SMA connectors to reach the internal mPCIE wireless card, but that was a error I made when buying external antennas.Sorry I only took the one photo but it does show off how compact this case is and that a stock Intel CPU fan will work. Plus, the DC input connector (5.5mm x 2.5mm) and external SMA connectors placement.Didn't have a ton of time to test for stability and temperatures, but with stock cooler being the only fan I was surprised it had no issues pushing 1080p video without losing power or overheating. Could feel airflow on all hole-y sides of the case. Can't remember the temps I saw, but have had zero complaints from the buyer. Actually, they claimed it was the quickest PC they'd ever used (they're not very tech savvy).Overall: good buy and design for the price if your looking to build either a HTPC or pfSense box.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Nice and compact case but would have been better with USB 3.0",
                "reviewText": "Compact case and good price. Building in it is fairly simple and there's room for a 3.5\" hard disk. I'm using this with an Asus J4005I-C motherboard that has a built in CPU and heatsink and an M.2 SSD slot, so I had plenty of room to work with. The vertical stand makes it neat when standing on your desk.I do wish the case had USB 3.0 as there are smaller cases than this that do. The front LED lights up blue and the disk activity LED lights up red but it is quite faint to see, you have to really look at it to notice. Also, one of the USB ports on mine doesn't seem to transfer data, only power. Looking inside, it seems like the board for the USB ports is quite worn out, not something I expect from a new product. It's a minor inconvenience so I'm not all that upset about it.There's a mounting hole for the 12V DC input jack and 2 mounting holes for what I think are WiFI antennas, I believe they are SMA antenna mounts (not too sure on this but it looks like it). There's also no less than 6 RS-232 Serial port cutouts at the back, but you need to push out the covers to uncover them.Overall, the case is nice, and also light. Probably a good choice for a portable desktop or a small footprint low power server/PC.",

                "reviewText": "Through various builds and tear downs I ended up with a spare APU that needed a home. This case looked to be nearly perfect. Inexpensive, no larger than needed, and focused connectivity.Many users might lament to lack of USB 3.0 on the front but small cases IMO don't have need everything. Just enough. This case has \"just enough\" aplenty. Separate headphone and microphone jacks, and 2 USB 2.0 ports make up the front panel. Audio, mouse and keyboard. Just as it should be.Although it supports a 3.5\" hard drive only certain motherboards can take advantage of this capacity.For any motherboard with barrel jack power input this case is ideal. No gaping holes for ATX or even SFX power supply, again just enough space.Small format cases often skimp on ventilation yet again this case does not disappoint. Lots of perforation all over. Air in, air out. Just as it should be.The largest drawback I can address is the lack of a VESA mount interposer. Every thin-client style case needs this. It's almost unacceptable. If I'm not attaching a case to the rear of a monitor it's wall mounted.Still all in all is a great little case with few shortcomings, that I am glad to use.",
