                "reviewText": "Case looks great- the dual white black theme really makes it pop. Fits a b550 ATX board along with a 2080 without issue. One thing to note is that the rightmost standoffs for the ATX motherboard aren't preinstalled, which is slightly annoying, as the holes for the screw seem to be slightly smaller. To be fair, they don't really matter, but it still took some effort to get those in. Airflow is great- plenty of air for the GPU and the air cooler that I'm using, and I do plan on adding more fans to increase the intake of air from the top side. The side panel is also well built with a magnetic latch; it opens quite easily with a pull tab.",

Simple to work with, excellent cable management, and water cool radiator fits perfect. The RGB worked well with the MB and can bypass with the push of a button. The airflow seems to work well with 3 days of burn in time and cpu/gpu stress test did well too. The build quality of the case is excellent and looks nice too :). I Will most definitely be ordering more of these for future customer builds and may replace some older builds personally. I took a chance on an unknown case model with no regrets.",

                "reviewText": "Had it for several weeks now. Overall, it was easy to build in and looks sleek and solid. I like the tinted glass panel. Didn't have much of an issue with space for cable management. It fits an Nvidia 4070ti no problem as well as a 360mm radiator top mounted. Case fans are pretty quiet, BUT there's a reason for that, hence the warning.As another reviewer mentioned, the case fans are all 2-wire, 4-pin molex, which means they connect directly to your power supply and are not variable speed. They are low-speed fans that turn at the same rate regardless of cpu temp. This is causing an issue for me (running an i9-13900K). Even at max speed, my radiator fans are starved for air because the case fans can't spin any faster to provide more intake air to the case. I have a set of new fans on order to replace the original case fans. Not a huge deal, once I identified the issue. Ultimately, I wouldn't say it makes the case unusable by any means, but it's something to keep in mind if you're planning on a build with a power hungry cpu that tends to run hot. You may need to swap out the case fans for something with variable control.Edit: Also wanted to add that I just replaced the front case fans with the new variable ones and the front panel IS removable, as another review mentioned. Simple push-clips that snap in and out. No tools required.",

                "reviewText": "This thing really has the room to build a real gamer pc at a reasonable price. This is my second case cause I am using a Nvidia 4080 which is (understatement) large. If there is any attempt at cable managment or fan support the GPU is just not going to fit. The previous case I attempted to use was great but just lacked the space for both the cooler and the GPU card. This thing handles both with room to spare and allows neat cable management with strategic ports from the back. I would have liked the top controls in the front but no a biggy. The only complaint is that the back panel really doesn't fit as well as it should but again how often will I need to access. There is another. Forget about finding a support site.Edit: After much trial and error then seeing other reviews I found that I cannot control the case fans with the motherboard controls. I am not stressing the thing with much oc so temps are not that bad but it does mean that any money saved will go to buying 4 controllable fans.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this case for a budget build for my son's first PC. Quality is great for the price, although some minor features are lacking compared other more expensive cases, but this is to be expected. No built in standoffs, and the screw holes are not marked, so you will need to install the ones you need by looking at your board. Not a big deal really. The hinges on the glass panel seem a little flimsy, but I don't expect it to be much of an issue. I like that it has a built in controller for the aRGB with a push button on the case to toggle through different patterns. Since this was a budget build, I wasn't really concerned with adding razer or icue integration, and having a standalone option to just toggle through some neat patterns was a nice plus. Overall value is exceptional and airflow doesn't seem to be an issue at all. Cable management side had some velcro straps pre-installed that came in handy. Overall very happy with this purchase.",

I looked at cases a long time and chose this one. It did not disappoint. It has lots of room for a large power supply many SSD hard drives and comes with many lit fans. (3 in front, 1 in the rear.)I was able to place all of the power/reset/usb on my MoBo with everything working on the first try! My large radiator sits nicely at the top of the case. The glass side easily opens and looks pretty cool. The top of the case has a button to change the color options of all the fans., as well as 3 USB, headphones and mic, power and restart. <see photo>I got everything crammed in and it looks pretty cool and clean",
