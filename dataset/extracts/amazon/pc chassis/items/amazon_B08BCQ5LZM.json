                "reviewText": "This was the first open design case I've ever messed with. The assembly process can be a bit of a headache and not newbie friendly to those just getting into pc building.Pros:The case looks amazing especially with the fan lights, the size of this case is also at a perfect middle ground with it being pretty compact for an ATX mid tower but having an pretty good amount of space to work with inside.Air flow is by far the best thing about this case. It comes with 7 case fans, on top of my chromamax and 3070 fans the case stays impressively cool 99% of the time even when stress testing.One last thing I loved about this case is the option to expand the glass sides to make some more room. I have a noctua chromamax installed and that boy is a heck heckin beast. It fit perfectly with just about an inch of space left so i didnt need the extended brackets for the glass panel but it's really neat to have that option.Cons:The case has little to no room for HDD or SDD drives, make sure your mobo has slots for m.2s cause it'll be far less of a headache just using them instead.The two fans on the front glass panel are both a good and bad thing here, the good thing is they actually pull a decent amount of air in considering they're centimeters from the glass panel. The bad thing is in order to even reach or install your psu you're gonna have to pull those fans out. Not a huge issue but for someone who's new to building and is somewhat impatient its not a good thing.Last but not least is structure. The case by itself with both panels removed is weak. Barely putting pressure on it with cause the back to give and break.The case is truly nice, and probably one of my most favorite cases I've owned up to this point, the only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the packaging was damaged, box and Styrofoam. And I'm missing a few parts that were supposed to come with it, specifically the two trays for drives. Again not a big deal but still, someone messed up somewhere.",

The ONE and ONLY issue I had with the case was a top fan had a slight wobble to it which created a clicking sound when running, simple fix just pushed it up and down and got the wobble out of it, other than that everything went smooth and worked as it should, very quiet as well! Great bang for your buck. 9.75/10",

Not for a first time builder as you'll have no guidance or instructions, also note that my frame was not aligned/even , I had to remove the rivets and aline them so the MOBO would sit on properly. 3 out of 10 recommend $99 is a better price for this case.NOTES : will not fit a radiator larger than 240mmSsd and hdd must be installed before mobo to avoid issuesRgb is not pretty good if you keep stock fans",
