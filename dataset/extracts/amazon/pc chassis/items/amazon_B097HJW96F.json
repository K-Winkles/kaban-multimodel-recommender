                "reviewText": "This case is FANTASTIC for its price!Pros:- Fairly priced- VERY sturdy build quality- Actually HAS a PSU shroud (I'm looking at you, DIY-F2)- Easy cable management features (Long enough mobo standoffs, plenty of room behind the right side panel, plenty of cutouts in the right side and shroud)- All standoff sockets are labeled per motherboard form factor, which is really nice for inexperience builders- Three magnetic dust filters (front, top, PSU)- Tall feet for PSU fan breathability- Tempered glass side panel (Again, I'm looking at you, DIY-F2)- VERY aesthetically pleasing for the price. This case looks even better in-person than it does in any pictures. As far as looks go, I really wouldn't mind building an enthusiast/endgame rig in this thingCons:- It only comes with one fan (and there's no RGB, if you care). This isn't inherently an issue, just make sure you buy extra fans if you don't have them.- The PSU shroud is riveted in, so you can't remove it. This leads to the next two cons:- There are no good 2.5\" SSD mounting options. You would be able to screw one into the HDD bay, but you can't fit a screwdriver in there because the PSU shroud isn't removable. The only other SSD mounting options are directly on top of cable management cutouts. Both of these are very strange design choices.- Mounting the bottom fan on the front panel is really awkward, because the PSU shroud gets in the way. But it is possible.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this case to build a PC for my wife. I was quite happy with the price and the case overall. My only gripes being the lack of plugs to hide the cables went fed through the pass-though to the back of the case and molex fans that are included (and easy swap though so, really, a minor gripe). That aside, it has some really good airflow, it comes with two filters and the normal stand-off/hardware bag but no real instructions. Plenty of cable tie-downs, but they are rudimentary (read: zip-tie only).Overall a good case and at a decent price.",

It's big enough for fans in the front with my RTX 3080 and my rather tall cooler for the CPU, but measure carefully. Their clearance info was spot on, but it's a tight fit for these things. There are many 3080s that wouldn't fit with front fans, or at all.",

It was easy to build in, made of good materials, provides your components with ample airflow, good paint, and had fine cable management options.The only negative would be the breakaway PCI slot covers, which during removal can potentially bend the surrounding metal. And also the thumb screws from both the glass and rear panel are NOT captive and remove completely.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The description of this case says it comes with three ARGB fans. It doesn't though, in fact, it doesn't even come with enough fans to have proper airflow out of the box. The case come with just one regular black fan for exhaust, so you're on your own for intake airflow. This is fine if the price reflected this, however, you're paying about $74 for this when it should only be around $60 considering that. Once you move beyond the initial unboxing disappointment, it's actually a good case.It's on the small-medium small side as far as size goes. I was able to fit a low profile 240mm radiator for the CPU cooler on the inside of the front, and it houses my RX 6700 XT with plenty of room to spare. Here are a couple of tips when building with this case. You will want to install your ssd/hdd into the removable rack before you install your power supply (trust me) It's cramped in this area post PSU installA couple of notes:-The PSU shroud is rivetted in so it is not removable.-It has three magnetic dust filters -one on the top, front, and bottom-Cable management options are good-Easy to access as the side panels are held on by just two thumb screws each like most cases-The power/reset/2 usb and 1 usb3.0 ports are on the top near the front of the case.-Front panel just pops off and has enough space for some 120mm fans to be installed behind itOverall, it's a good, clean looking case, I just wish it was as described as I had to add my own ARGB fans.So if you're reading this seller, please ship me the fans I paid for when I bought this case. Other than that, I'm very happy with the case and give it 4/5 stars.",

Compact and sturdy.3. Decent airflow and plenty of magnetic dust filters, including one for PSU.4. The tempered glass has a rubber cushion that slides back and fort smoothly . Very satisfying.5. Standoffs provided along with plenty of spare screws and standoffs.6. Front panel IO isn't actually attached to front panel but on the top (2X USB2, 1 USB3, Power, Reset and Audio). Which begs the question , why does it have such a prominent front panel? Just ornamentation I guess.Cons(all minor)1. The slots for expansion cards have to be permanently removed. This means if you change motherboard or graphics card you could be having a hole at the back that used to fit old devices.2. Unnecessary dust filter at the top. Exhaust don't need filters. Only intake should have filter and only and Idiot will put an intake at the top.3. I bought a white case but it has a slight blue tint like someone put Ujala on it.",
