                "reviewText": "I gotta say this case is massive compared to my old 4000D airflow(comparison in attatched photos), but I need it to cool my parts and didn't wanna have to upgrade the case ever again. Despite how many features it has its actually pretty easy to build in and has 4 140mm fans, plus 2 fan hubs with 6 headers each for fans using the included commander core and a small pre installed fan hub. Case is massive and the thing easily fits my noctua NH-15 cooler and 3080 gpu. I would however say that the major complaint I have is the class pannels, because they restrict airflow ALOT, so I just took them off later on and Temps reduced. Cable management is pretty good, I'm just bad at it, but it is kinda tricky to route the pc fans from the front to the hub if you have fans in the side optional compartment spot, but it's possible. Overall really happy with this case and can't wait to see what else I can do with it.",

                "reviewText": "Arrived next day shipping. Shipping box was a little worn but upon opening product it was in perfect condition. Many different fan options to choose from and plenty of room for everything. Easy to work inside of case during parts installation. Only minor drawback was moving the front 3 140mm fans to the top. Fan cables were routed through the partition to divert air over mobo. Had to cut a zip tie that was difficult to reach to remove fans and then secure cables again. Bigger and more detailed instructions would be helpful to a beginner on how to disassemble the parts in the case. Would like to have had covers for some of the larger openings on the cable side of the case with rubber grommets like the other cable routing holes. Corsair needs to put out a very easy and descriptive chart regarding Commander daisy chains for multiple fans. 15 fans installed and was a bit of a guessing game on how to set up for power/rgb. Overall very happy with aesthetics, quality of build, ease of access and large door panel removal/installation. Case keeps temps about 5-7c cooler than previous Lian Li 216 mid tower. Definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Corsair put together REALLY nice cases...this one is no exception. It's HUGE btw, and heavy. Wire management is super nice, you get swing out doors as well as an interior metal door to keep all your wires behind. It has many usb front panel ports which are always handy to have. The case is also modular so if you wanted to vertically mount stuff, you could...expose or shroud the power supply, up to you...There are many spots for hard drives of all sizes from large 3.5's down to SSD's. One nice feature is the ease of removing the glass at the fans - they're held securely in place with friction fittings...and the fan mesh is a vinyl that is magnetically held in place so you can pull it out completely and get any dust off with ease. Overall, I'm super happy with the case, how it looks and it's function. It's well thought out and I'd defiantly suggest it to anyone looking to do a new build - this one is future proof in my opinion. Here are some pics of my build using the case...my rooms lighting is set for a gaming environment but the case is white...",

The cable management is excellent, very spacey although there is a really dumb panel in the back that doesn't close if you have many cables. I just simply took it off with no issues. Airflow is great and the seamless integration with iCUE thanks to the pre-installed fans makes adjusting the fans (which are deadly silent on full blast) really simple. The case is HUGE so be prepared for that, fits my 4090, 360mm radiators, 120mm fans and atx mobo with room to spare. It's made out of very high quality material and as a result is extremely heavy and somewhat hard to work with but worth the price if you really need the room like I did (looks so much better than the pictures as well).",
