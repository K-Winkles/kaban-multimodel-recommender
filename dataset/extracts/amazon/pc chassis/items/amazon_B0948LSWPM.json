The only problem is that assembly is very difficult unless you have an easy way to measure distances such as 68.28 millimeters. It worked out fine but I basically had to get it as close as I could with a ruler and than align the standoffs by placing an atx board on top and checking if the stand offs lined up. It took quite a few adjustments, and for this price I would have expected an easier assembly.",
