The case alone is actually really well designed, with plenty of room in plenty of area's for allowing you to fill out the case with the parts you desire. I was pretty impressed as I'm used to Lian Li or Corsair cases, so seeing this being so well constructed was kinda impressive knowing a paid a quarter of what some of those cost. It was the base to a computer for my child, and both of us are quite happy with the latest gaming rig.",

                "reviewText": "I used to think people who tricked out their computers were OCD overachievers. But now in my later years, sitting in my dark office, I never tire of watching my Apollo spinning orbs under my desk.. reminding that I am indeed a master builder of 30 years.The case is sturdy enough. It is light enough. There is room enough for any board, though I highly recommend an m-ATX board size to give you better choices for wire routing.The glass door on a hinge is smart (entire door can be removed).. and I like the magnetic pull lever to open it. Glass front is a change of pace and enhances the frontal lighting. Please note the stickers on the fans are NOT perfectly centered and when the fans spin, they create a wobble-illusion. I actually LIKE this effect. (The fans are centered properly, it's an illusion)My work office is whisper quiet and I do hear the fans if I listen intently, but they are more a hushed whisper. Quiet freaks will be satisfied.Venting and wire routing is perfect, the display vents for the PSU and fan mount options all work for me, but honestly in this model, other than the CPU fan, it's silly to add more fans than what comes with the case.I am also new to ARGB.. and this was the first time I took advantage. With eight color choices at the touch of a button, what is there not to love? (My fav is aqua) Make sure your board has the dedicated '2 pin- empty gap-1 pin' special ARGB headers or you will NOT get the multi lighting benefits. DO NOT TRY TO FIT THESE INTO ANY OTHER HEADER or you will blow circuits.Trap door overhanging the rear PCIe slots was new to me.. and it took me a few moments to figure out that you just twist the knob-screw retainer and swing it out.I paid $63 for the case when it was on sale and I would pay more to buy it again. The price is excellent. The ARGB fans alone are worth quite a bit (keep that in mind when case shopping.)",

They're not loud or obnoxious, but you can definitely hear them* Not the best airflow out the box. Both front and back fans are setup to pull, so there is not push-pull action. Not a huge deal. You can always flip the back fan if needed.I would highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I was hoping that by going with big fans I wouldn't hear them and this case did not disappoint! I have to put an ear about 3 inches (8 cm) from the fans to hear anything at all. I appreciated the customizability of this case. I could fit a large video card (ARC 770) easily and I knew it'd fit beforehand because the dimensions were clearly defined on the market page. I was able to remove parts I didn't need with ease and the whole thing still feels solid. I love the big window so I can easily see the innards of my system (and the colors). There's lots of pass-through spaces on the motherboard mount to pass cables through to keep things looking nice and neat. I think this is my favorite case I've ever had and I've been building systems since the 90's. Very nice!",

I changed the front fans because I wanted to connect them to my motherboard because the original connectors are not compatible with the motherboard connectors.
