It is a cheaper example of the Corsair 200R - not quite as wide, but the same general layout for drives. Another difference is that the Corsair is all powder coated metal, this one is metal framed but plastic hardware for holding drives. Nevertheless, unless you are going to open her up and play under the hood more than a couple times a year, some of the plastic parts could break. Otherwise, this is a great basic case - not much for gaming as none of your gear is visible because it's a solid case. For us, it works great and $43 was more than fair.",

                "reviewText": "I was pretty happy with this case overall. It was a bit of a tight fit stepping down from a full tower Lian Li case that I was previously using but managed to get all the components to fit after a bit of trial and error. A couple of things to note. The drive bays are a little strange but actually kind of cool once you get used to them.The drives will \"snap\" into the carriers, thing is you actually put them in so the sata connectors are towards the back of the case. If you put them in toward the front the cables won't fit properly under the side cover as there is very little space there once that cover is on. However it is easy enough to just feed them through the case to the back and you've got a lot more room to work with. Makes for good cable management I guess but it was a bit unexpected so I was scratching my head for a minute or two.This will mount 2 120mm fans up front, on in the rear and two up top of standard size which is a lot of airflow. My setup is a bit different, my CPU uses a water cooling rig with a single 120mm radiator so I mounted that out the back, relocated the 120 mm fan that was there to the top (only room for one in this case, you can't really mount the second fan as the radiator is just a touch too big to allow the fan to go in up top, then I mounted two 120mm fans up front. Works very well, keeps the system quite cool and I'm very happy with thermal management.Hard drive bays are nice, you've got room for 3 x 5.25 and the covers for those slots can be removed and then replaced if you decide to change your setup which is very nice, they just snap in. Internally you have 3 2.5 bays which work great for SSD drives and 3 3.5 inch bays that I used for some 8tb sata drives for a good amount of storage.I did add a fan controller, having all those fans running full blast was a bit noisy and I liked being able to turn them down a bit to quiet the system a tad. But all in all it's a good little case, I liked it because it is just low key and doesn't have all that silly acrylic side panel look at all the LED lights like a lot of other mid tower cases have. I know people love those for gaming rigs but I'm building a computer, not a landing strip for aircraft.. lol.I would purchase this again, for the money it's pretty hard to beat for mid tower cases. I did give it 4 out of 5 stars due to the lack of well written documentation, getting this together was more trial and error than anything else, and the location of the 120mm fan exhaust port on the rear, if they had just moved that down a centimeter or two I would have had room for another fan. I don't need it for cooling you understand up top but it's an OCD thing, I've got one slot with a fan and one without which just looks a little off. But other than that, great case.",

This one fit the bill, an ATX mid motherboard fit perfect, added 4 more 120mm fans, SSD drive and Blu Ray Burner, power supply.

                "reviewText": "This case is really neat. It has easy to disassemble the parts particular for both side panels with a simple screw though it's a thick plastic not sure how durable it'll be in the coming years. Easy to assemble the parts back tho it has 3 gold or yellow-ish bolts to screw in the case to place the motherboard at it would of been nice if it already had it in place but since you have to screw it in yourself you'll have to put some strength into it so the motherboard screws don't take the bolts with it if you have to disassemble it for any reason as it can be a pain trying to unscrew it while holding onto the motherboard speaking from experience as a first time custom PC builder.My only issue is the front intake vent is difficult to either take out for a quick clean up (I still haven't figured it out) while the intake vent in the back-bottom is so easy to remove and clean.Semi-off-topic. I'm so glad this has 2x 2.0 USB ports to make installing Windows 7 much more tolerable as using the 3.0 USB ports in the back would not work with my MSI B350M motherboard. My only concern is a potential Windows 7 issues using the F8 command as all USB ports do not function with regular USB mouse and keyboard at all. May want to grab a PS 2 mouse and keyboard for such instances.",

Flimsy metal, cheap plastic HDD trays when we should be moving away from such materials, once you remove the rear close-outs and the 5.25 optical bay closures - you will never get them to fit back in as the tin foil metal bends irreparably. Also the numerous sharp edges from breaking out said closures cut your hand with annoying regularity.God how I wish I had bought mt Elements G case home - it was everything that this one is not. Buy a different brand as Thermaltake are no longer a quality manufacturer. If I could give this 0 stars, I would.",
