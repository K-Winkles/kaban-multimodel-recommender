I believe its a bit too expensive for feature set-- No cable Management Options-- A bit cramped. Needs to be at least 2 inches longer-- Only Compact GPU's supports. Not enough clearance for full length GPU's-- No option to swap out center & right bay for fans or remove all together to re-gain additional space.This would allow space for wire management and the ability to install full length GPU'sFinal Thoughts:The case is ok. Wish it had more options specifically around removing center & right bay to regain space. Bought this case for a UnRaid build but due to limitations the final PC will be going to my Dad",

                "reviewText": "The quality of the box itself is great -- very solid, good material quality. Quick-mounts for the front cages (left, center, and right) are really nice -- once you figure out how to slide them out of the box while building. (They have rubber grommets to isolate vibration which is a nice touch.) The hot-swap cage works well and is easy to seat/eject drives.There are three things that keep this from being \"perfect\":1. 2-3\" too short (note this means length from the faceplate to the rear of the chassis, not vertical depth which is standard 3U). I re-used a full-size ATX mobo (Asus Prime z370-A) and the front edge of the board is RIGHT at the back edge of the drive cages. Cramming SATA cables, etc. under things to get them attached was easily the hardest/most annoying part of the entire build. The case is only 17\"-ish long so going to 20\" and giving just a touch more room inside would have been ideal for me.2. The fans are ... let's say \"not great\". I replaced every fan in the box after turning it on once -- like a helicopter landing in my lap. Went with Noctua NF-R8 redux for every spot and the difference is amazing. (I even replaced the hard-wired fan on the rear of the hot-swap cage but that takes a bit of Dremel work. Again, definitely worth it.)3. This one doesn't go against the rating but like most people at the time I write this, finding rail kits for this case is nearly impossible. I have not investigated generic kits from other vendors because it's too easy to just have mine sit on a brace (the slot under the NAS is empty except for the faceplate) but I can see this being an issue in some situations.All in all, I'm thrilled and will definitely get another should the need arise.",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent case of good build quality but the main issue is that it's significantly shorter than a standard 4U server case. If they had made this case about 4-6 inches longer it would be able to support a much wider variety of components and be a lot easier to work inside of, but currently because it's so short I'm having issues with cable management and component clearance. While this will fit a standard ATX form factor motherboard it will be a tight fit so if that's what you plan to put in here I would recommend looking for a longer case.",

                "reviewText": "I got this case, and everything inside was fabulous; the SATA bays, the backplane, the internal wiring, and I didn't have the space issues others have reported. The problem is with the rails, or the lack thereof. The RMS06-22 rails that are compatible with this case are relatively expensive, but the bigger issue is they are utterly unavailable. I ordered a set only to be told they were on backorder without a delivery date, and searching and calling for a week only yielded retailers willing to call me back when they get some in. Even eBay was a dry hole -- I couldn't confirm that any of these rails had ever been produced. I even tried an afternoon in the lab trying different Supermicro and Dell rails, but none have compatible screw spacings.If you can source the rails ahead of time, or if you don't need the rails for some reason, this is a great case. But make sure you have them in-hand before ordering.",
