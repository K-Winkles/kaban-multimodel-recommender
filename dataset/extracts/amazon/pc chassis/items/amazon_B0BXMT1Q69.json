                "reviewText": "Upgrading from an am4 build in an asus tuff gaming case to an am5 with an eatx board found I needed a different case. First to properly fit an eatx board, also to fit a corsair shift psu, and to accommodate a verticle gpu mount for the largest 4090 card. Plus a 360 aio. Have good airflow. And finally, not look like every other copy paste box out there.This one met all those needs and as a bonus is aorus matching the gpu and board.The construction is durable which I expect from such an expensive case, even the psu cover is metal. Cable management wasn't too difficult has a good amount of rear space, channels, and tie downs. The included fans are quiet so far but I moved them to the bottom of the case and put in my corsairs for front and rear.The top aio mount isnt the best, cannot mount a 360 with fans directly attached, either fans under in case and rad out in tray or vice versa. And with a 360 it wount fit in tray due to not having enough cut out to fit the tubes so I had to mount fans in tray and rad under it, the cuts for the top cover are too large and could allow debris to fall into fans so the magnetic dust filter needs to sit on the fans to protect them but doesn't cover fully as its designed to sit on the bottom of an empty tray which is narrower then the cover itself.Otherwise I like this case.",

                "reviewText": "The case is solidly built, feels good, looks fantastic, with good I/O support on the front and many places to do cable management. The case itself is a bit on the smaller side but the interior has very logical build and feels very spacious. It can easily fit a beefy aftermarket GPU and a large AIO.Where the case has some weird design decisions...HDMI cable on the front panel?I mean, sure, some users may want to use that, but it routes the HDMI cord through the internal of the PC... obviously that's where the problem starts--how do you get it into your GPU? I suppose if your mobo had internal HDMI...Front panel takes Molex for rgb power?As title says...Vertical mounting is annoyingIt's an advertised feature but it places the GPU very, very close to the glass window. Additionally the instructions are extremely unclear. The case provides a very rudimentary mounting rack which is not compatible with all cables.Bottom filter is not protectedMinor nitpick, but if you lift the case from the rear (which is more or less intuitive because of the weight of the PSU), the bottom filter is unguarded and you may accidentally damage your air filter.There is a fat \"MADE IN CHINA\" font scratched onto the back of the caseIt's in huge font, and it's not etched with a high amount of quality either, like someone scratched it in with a screwdriver.The front panel is tightly attached to cablesIf you're gonna do cable management, try to leave some slack. The front panel cannot be taken off unless the cables have room to pull with it.Overall, it's a shiny, good quality, fantastic looking case. It's pricey, and has quite a few weird design decisions, and at this price point I'd expect a case to smooth these out...",

                "reviewText": "Love the case but it's biggest down fall is not having top radiator support and the vertical mount.Gigabyte didn't leave enough space between the side panel and the graphics card on the vertical mount. So basically what happens is that there isn't enough room to disperse heat so your graphics card ends up running 5-10c hotter.I'm currently using a 5700xt nitro + and once i can find an upgrade I'll have to install back to the board directly... 5700 cards take up like 2.5 slot places next gen cards take 3 so side panel wouldn't be able to fit back on the case because your graphics card is bulging out.If they make future iterations of this case, make more room for vertical mounting and add support for radiator on the top panel.This case is great for all air cooling.",

Lots of options for component installations (e.g. vertical or horizontal mounting of a video card, extra parts like PCIE slot covers, and lots of different case screws).This is a big, fat case and on one hand, I'm impressed but the other hand... Holy huge!I highly recommend this case.",
