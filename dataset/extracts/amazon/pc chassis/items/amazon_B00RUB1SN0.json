                "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2021",
                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Extremely high build quality, but it takes some patience to build inside successfully.",
                "reviewText": "I purchased and built my system into the mini-ITX variant of the In Win 900 series, the 901. First and most importantly, the case is heavy, but for a reason: the aluminum wrap-around panel and the tempered glass side panels exude elegance and manufacturing attention-to-detail. The interior of the case is a matte-finished anodized-feeling black coat, and it makes tracing your probably-black cables difficult, so I recommend having a flashlight handy just in case, as some corners are tricky to see into, and the case isn't exactly easy to lift up to peer into if needed. Getting cables to route properly throughout the case is somewhat easy, depending on the tier of hardware and therefore the number of required cable runs. The pre-routed hot-swappable drive bays at the front top of the case are easy to use, and the SATA data cables are long enough to reach my motherboard headers, but not too long as to clutter the back/side of the system too much. Also, installing the slimline optical drive is the single simplest part: just remove the slot cover, level the drive out, and guide it back until it seats into the pre-routed combo header.The big downsides to building inside of this case, however, are also some of its selling points. The optical drive slot uses a floppy drive power plug (which then include a molex to floppy adapter for in the box for), but not much else in the system can/will use molex in the modern hardware ecosystem. The case's relatively compact form for a mini-tower case is great for smaller spaces, however it also means that the internal layout is cut down, even compared to other ITX enclosures, especially regarding PCIE expansion slots (the 901 only has 2, and cannot fit any extra tall GPUs or extra thick 2.5+ slot cards that are growing in popularity). The 120mm and 90mm fan mount areas at the front-bottom and top-rear of the case respectively are nice touches, as otherwise the case would be starved for cool air, but they are vastly different. The front 120mm mount area is inside a neat little drawer, and thus completely hidden from view, so you can put as ugly-but-useful a fan as you like. Meanwhile, the rear 90mm fan sits directly on top of the motherboard I/O shield cutout and, unless you choose an extremely thin fan, you will see a lot of this fan (good for RGB fans, not so good if you went function over form). The fan mounts are both appreciated, but I recommend doing some research to find a fan worth putting in either/both spots to make sure they're well-utilized by the PC inside this case.Finally, and most importantly, is the cable routing situation. The case *does* have channels and cutaways for cables to be routed between chambers and compartments within the chassis, but getting those cables to fit in a way that looks nice through tempered glass, and that allows that glass to be put safely back on a side/back panel is tricky, again depending on how much and what type of hardware you choose to install. I populated both hot swap sleds, one of the other 2.5\" spaces, the ODD area, a full dual-slot GPU, and both fan mounts. I used a modular SFX PSU with an ATX adapter bracket attached, so I had about as much room as you can get in the PSU basement chamber, and it's still mostly filled up. My runs turned out clean-ish, and thankfully the pre-routed case cabling comes sleeved in a black mesh-like material that hides its rainbow-colored nature. While extremely rewarding to close close in and power on, the In Win 901 is not a straighforward case to build in, but if you get comfortable and clever with cables, you will not be disappointed with this little art piece of a case.",

                "reviewText": "This case is gorgeous! I built my new gaming PC yesterday as soon as this case got delivered. It was packaged very well and once I pulled the dust cover off I was in awe. It's sturdy, heavy, and so very clean looking. Everything installed without issue. The way the case is designed there is plenty of room for big video cards (I have two, and they fit easily). The hard drives slide into slots with pre-made sata and power connections. One slot needed some adjusting because it wasn't lined up perfectly with the plugs in the back. It only took loosening a couple screws to fix. The only tricky part was mounting the reservoir for my cpu cooler. The instruction manual was a little fuzzy on this, but it made sense afterwards. Overall this case is great! I would highly recommend it. It is easy to work on and will definitely attract some attention from fellow computer nerds.",

Also, access to the rear motherboard ports is awful. The manufacurer left maybe 4 inches of room to fit your hand in to plug stuff in.Buy this only if looks are more important than useability. They were for me.",
