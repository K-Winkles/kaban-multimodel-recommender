                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent case at a great price.",
                "reviewText": "This (907 Phantom black) is an excellent case for the price. It\u2019s hard to find much info about this case online so I decided to do a basic review here.Materials are all high quality, the tempered glass panels in particular are very impressive. The glass panels are secured with stealthy black thumbscrews that are easy to remove when cleaning the case and doing the install. The glass side panel has black corner protectors that can be removed or left in place for aesthetics. There is plenty of room and options for cable management here. I was even able to fit a non modular Corsair power supply with a massive nest of cables quite easily in the case.The six included fans are shockingly quiet and provide a nice level of cooling. If you need extreme cooling and don\u2019t want to go with AIO\u2019s you may want to upgrade the fans, but the cooling provided by the stock fans is excellent for my setup. If you don't want to upgrade the fans and find that you need a bit more cooling when gaming you can also remove the front glass panel to get a nice overall temp reduction. Removing the front glass panel reduces temps significantly, in my testing the overall temp of my overclocked RTX 2060 Super was reduced by 9\u00b0C under max load to 56\u00b0C!The included fan controller I received was setup for 5v 3-pin ARGB and not 4-pin RGB so I could not connect it to my motherboard to attempt control through software (no 5v ARGB header). I had already planned on using the included remote so this was not a huge problem for me, just be prepared if you are buying a new mobo for the case or if your existing board does not have ARGB headers. The fan controller works well with the included remote and controls brightness, mode, and speed of the fans when simply connected to an available SATA power connector from your PSU. Plenty of options there for me and the rgb lighting provided by the fans is killer.Another apparent change in the model I received was plastic PCI slot covers that are secured with a bracket plate and thumbscrew. No bending and snapping off metal PCI slot covers required and I definitely prefer the plastic covers (no sharp edges).The feet on the bottom of the case have a soft rubber material on them so the case stays in place and won\u2019t scratch your desk surface. The only reason I gave 4 stars for material quality is several of the already installed mobo risers were tapped poorly and screws were stopping early or going crooked when screwed in. I had spares to replace the wonky risers so this wasn\u2019t a big deal, but it is worth mentioning and I advise testing your screws in the risers before you seat your mobo. They also included spare wires for the power switch, reset switch, and HDD/Power light LED's. If this is your first build note that you can ignore these and set them aside as backups if something were to go wrong with the ones that are already installed.NOTE: If your front panel connector cables for HDD LED, power etc. do not have + or - paint to indicate positive or negative wire there will be a triangle on the back side of the connectors. The triangle indicates which wire is the positive wire.TLDR: Fantastic case at this price point and one I recommend if your budget doesn\u2019t allow for a more expensive case. If you are considering this case go ahead and pull the trigger!",

                "reviewText": "Well, it was very tricky to mount a MSi Z490 Tomahawk motherboard to the case. The board seemed to barely fit in and required me to remove the case fans from the top of the case to even get close to sliding in the board. Granted I installed the CPU cooler first but it would have been just as hard with it removed. Removing the motherboard also required removing the case fans. This makes building modern parts into it difficult. I first built this case with an older H81 motherboard that was half the length and I was able to slide that in and out without issue. Upgrades got me to 10/11th gen and it was a hit or miss experience.Another issue is the front glass inhibits airflow. When the front is removed there is a noticeable change in airflow. Only the exhaust on top and power supply is filtered. The power supply filter is low quality. However, I really like this case. The remote works great. The RGB button works well also. 6 fans included, can't beat that. Overall, it definitely deserves 4 stars. What a great looking case. Just has a few minor flaws I can overlook.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this initially almost a month ago. After my first unit arrived looking like Hagrid drop kicked it, Amazon sent me a replacement (thanks for making that super easy, Amazon!). I got my system built in a couple of hours, using an old (10+ years) power supply with approximately 238939483 extra cords that I don't need, a full size ASROCK mobo, and a Nvidia 1060X (I'm broke and it's good enough for me). I used the stock cooler that came with my Ryzen 3600, but that will be changing.My initial impression is that it's a very good case, especially for the price point. It's fairly large, uses real glass, has excellent cable management, and everything fit easily. I'm not sure why some people had issues popping out the metal slots in the back, I found it really simple and I'm a noob at computer builds. The fan control that's included is a nice addition too, making it so I didn't have to daisy chain anything. Because the power supply area is covered, my massive number of additional cords is hidden from prying eyes. Much appreciated. All of the fans and buttons work.Now for the downsides. Obviously, this is a cheaper system and it comes with SIX RGB FANS. They are not going to be amazeballs. They are, however, extremely quiet and bright. They run. They work. They just are not adjustable from what I can find and they run at a relatively low RPM. When we're just doing basic stuff, the computer runs nice and cool (but, we also live in WA and it's pretty cool here in general), but when we're gaming, the CPU gets up to 76C quickly and has gone even higher. I know this isn't technically critical, but it makes me nervous. My old system ran at 35-40C under load, so this is significant to me. I believe this is a combo of the fans being lower RPM, using a stock cooler instead of the CoolerMaster Evo I had on there before, and potentially a lack of airflow due to the front glass panel.Due to this issue, I'm going to be trying an aftermarket cooler again to see how much that helps. If that doesn't help enough, I may change out the fans for a better quality set, with adjustable speeds and/or try removing the front glass panel and using a magnetic screen set to help keep dust out. However, even with this problem, I still feel like this case was a good deal and would absolutely recommend it. And, if your computer isn't being used for gaming 18+ hours a day, you'll probably be fine stock.Update: Been six months, still working perfectly. I never added a new screen but it stays relatively dust free anyway (probably because those fans are running to blow out instead of in). I also never added a new cooler, but it's staying cool enough that I haven't been worried. Now that summer is here, I'm shopping for a new cooler just as a precaution. I've had zero issues with this case. Get it! It's a great deal!",

                "reviewText": "I'll go straight to the cons:The corner guards on the glass panel do not fit well and fall off very easily.SSD mounting is iffy at best because ssd ends up very close to the case and just far enough from the hole for cable routing that it is a pain to plug the cables in. I had to use the screws only on the opposite end of the drives so I can pull them off away just enough to plug the cables in.The space on the back of the mobo tray is very narrow so cable routing is not the easiest as I had to press on the panel to install it.Most importantly there is no caddy for the hard drive and no way attach the drive any other way, so it just ends up sitting there loose. Since the company does not have their own website (I could not find any) I have no idea where and how I can buy the caddies.The fans can only be connected through the provided controller.There is not a whole lot of space at the top between the motherboard and the grill. the Preinstalled fans are nearly touching the VRM heatsink and it was a pain to plug in the 8 pin CPU supply. But they have created extra mounting holes so you can move the fans or a radiator to the side to create some space.The positives:If your board has argb connection you can connect the fans through the provided controller.You can control the fan speed through the remote they are also providing.You can install very long video card.The preinstalled fans are not very loud even at their highest speed. Kind of surprised me to be honest.All in all I'd say that it is not a bad case build wise. It feels very solid and spacious. I use ATX motherboard, it fit in without any issues while looking very snug.There is enough space for 4 SSDs (very tight but you can do it) and 2 HDDs.I have a 140 AIO cooler and and it fit in very nicely on the back. I might test the Wraith prism cooler instead though because the airflow in the case seems very good and I am not OCing my 3900x so it should stay nice and cool. I'd recommend the case, but only if you can get it for $20 cheaper. Or if it comes with at least one HDD caddy for the current price.",
