                "reviewText": "SECOND PURCHASE UPDATE: The ASUS ROG Maximus XII Hero Z490 is too big by a couple inches. It wont fit... so disappointed, because I love these cases.The moment I saw the Thermaltake Core V21 SPCC Micro ATX Cube Computer Chassis I knew I liked it and I HOPED I would love it.I LOVE IT.I've built PCs since early DOS on 8088s, XTs, 286, 386, 486, Pentiums, etc... THIS Thermaltake Core V21 is my favorite case EVER. And my other current PC is an OriginPC (which I LOVE).I'm a die hard ASUS motherboard fanatic. They're incomparable.I bought an ASUS ROG Strix Z490-G Gaming (WiFi 6) Z490 LGA 1200 (Intel 10th Gen) SFF Micro ATX Gaming Motherboard and it fits in this Thermaltake Core V21like they were designed on the same machine and built next to each other in the same factory. EVERYTHING FITS PERFECTLY: Screws, I/O panel, everything.After decades of building PCs I fully expected to be disappointed with the fit of the MB on the risers/offsets (lining up with mounting holes for screws), and I really was expecting the I/O panel in the back would not line up and would be the wrong size by a mm here and an mm there. Wrong. They fit like they were made for each other.Bravo ASUS and bravo Thermaltake.In my situation, I have my PCs on open wire shelves in a ventilated closet. I set this Thermaltake Core V21 with the MB vertical for better heat release because I'm mounting so many HDDs in the small compartment. I didn't want all the HDDs and the PSU power supply to be under the MB (heat rises).I set up the adjustable fan holder racks to be one on top, above the large compartment, and one on the side facing out. I have several feet of clearance above so the top fans will work great and the side fans will pull heat away from the wall behind the case ventilating to the open space in front of the shelf it is on.It was easy to realign the MB vertical after I RTFM and found the tiny screw holding on the front power switch I/O unit.THREE Complaints:1. The Thermaltake video states that the case panels are available for sale individually. As I write this I can't find them on Amazon or on their own website! I want to buy a ventilated panel because I won't be using the \"glass\" panel.2. There needs to be more optional HDD mounts. I'm buying several different bolt on HDD mounts to see which will fit inside after I have the huge video card and other things in the case. There are three decent/good (cheapy plastic--should be aluminum) HDD slider trays and a three HDD cage. I wish there was one more of these. I have six huge HDDs which are set up in RAID to be three HDDs.3. Oh those wonderful fan mounting bars that can be relocated as needed... they're VERY thoughtful and useful. But WATCH OUT I have cut my fingertips SO MANY TIMES on the little retainer thingies that hold them on (see pic). I highly recommend using small needle nose pliers to open and close the retainer fingertip slicers.After all the above, I wish I needed to build another PC because I would do it right now just to build it with this case. They're amazing.",

                "reviewText": "Case came in solid packaging and nothing was broken or damaged. The case is very customizable and allows for multiple configurations. Motherboard installation is really easy since the side panels can be removed for extra arm room, and the screwdriver doesn't have to be at an angle unlike some other cases. Power supply installation is not very good due to how different it is from other cases. Make sure to follow exactly what the manual says or there will be trouble installing the PSU. The case also has room for quite a few storage drives, but check to make sure your SATA Power cables can squeeze past the side panel to reach the 2.5\" drive bays on the side. Cable management is not the best either, as there aren't many provided spaces to attach and hide the cables in. I personally found that to properly cable manage in this case, slowly figure out what you can do at the moment and until then, don't worry about the rest of it.Turning on the PC feels nice, though the button could definitely feel a lot smoother. The (3-pin) front fan that came with it is very quiet and does push quite a bit of air around, though one should get a rear fan to exhaust heat out of the back. Even with the rear fan, airflow isn't exactly controlled. There are a lot of places heat can build up, so if you want to get the best airflow, you can use the included mounting brackets to install a much larger fan configuration that works best. The acrylic side panel window could definitely be larger and of higher quality, but still shows off the build well enough. Overall this is a great case to work in and I do recommend this case if you have the space for it.",

                "reviewText": "I am truly impressed by this little case. My wife's desktop computer was getting a bit long in the tooth and I had an i5 8600k lying around. We were wanting to create a build with a small footprint, so I decided to look into doing a mini-itx build. I was able to find a new 1151 socket mini-itx motherboard from ASRock for $99, so I started looking at the mini-itx cases out there. I wanted a case that could fit a full size atx power supply, a full size 2 slot video card, and could accommodate a decent sized cpu cooler. This case fit all of the requirements and was just $60. It would not fit a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo, so I started looking for another option. I came across a YouTube video where this guy was recommending a Zalman copper fin cooler with a 95mm fan that fit perfectly in this case (for Intel) and it was only $30.Man oh man, this case is pretty awesome. It is such a cool design, it compartmentalizes the components really well. The ATX power supply mounts on the bottom facing down and the case has an easily removable filter over the hole. The motherboard tray sits horizontally on top of the power supply and the video card (max 2 slot) sits along the nicely ventilated side panel. The other side of the case has two full size hard drive mounts, which this side is also ventilated. The top of the case has an acrylic window and the front of the case has an included 200mm case fan. The design of this case provides ample cable management space, I was blown away with how much space there actually was.Pros:Price for mini-itx caseFits full size ATX power supplyFits a full size 2 slot video cardFits 2 3.5\" or 2.5\" Hard DrivesHas included 200mm front case fan (3pin)Very good ventilationLots of room for cable managementCan fit a 120mm or 140mm radiator in the front (Have to remove 200mm fan)Top, both side, and bottom panel are all removable and have thumb screwsFront panel has some type of foam filter in placeCons:Top window is acrylic and not tempered glassIncluded 200mm front case fan is 3pin and is slightly noisy (being picky)Build quality is decent, but a bit flimsy (price fits this though)",

Would recommend if $100 or less.",
