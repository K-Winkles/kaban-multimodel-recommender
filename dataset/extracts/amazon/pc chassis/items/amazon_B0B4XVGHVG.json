                "reviewText": "When you have lots of Optical archive data, and NEED a DVD drive Slot in a case, you will need a case like this for a personal build. I looked at what seemed like HUNDREDS of cases and found lots with ODD bay slots, either one or 5 or something in between, hardly any had style, functionality and ease of maintenance like the Zalman Z1, I would have gone for an Antec Flux 502DP if I could have found one new for sale, it has a hidden ODD bay and swing out door. For the $69.99 price this lists for, you get 3 non-RGB fans, a high airflow case with that sexy glass side window and all the cables strategically hidden behind the motherboard and in the PSU basement. I liked this case so much I bought one for a good friends build to check the quality and was so impressed I bought another one for myself. I highly recommend this case if you want to show off the build, NEED an ODD bay for a Blu-Ray/DVD burner/Player and you don't want to spend over $80 bucks shipped to your door. It is very well built. thicker gauge steel than competitors like \"Cougar\" for instance. You have room for at least 2 HDD and 3 2.5 SSD drives as well. Plenty to love about this case in my opinion.",

                "reviewText": "The first case arrived dented, but looked very good in quality, it was a shipping mishap. When I requested a replacement, the seller went out his way to make sure I was satisfied--great support for the product. The new case arrived and looked perfect, the form/fit/function of this case is one of the best I've worked with. Excellent cable troughs, good power supply compartment layout, everything fit like a glove. Plenty of room for cable routing in the case with convenient places to zip-tie them out of the way, and look nice through the window. I replaced the rear fan with a blue LED fan and the case interior lights up nicely. The system is quiet and efficient thanks to this case and it's fans. At this price, I couldn't ask for more. I am very pleased and would recommend it to a friend.",

                "reviewText": "Well designed case. It has room for motherbuards with SATA connections that extend horizontally. This was built for an office application so I would have preferred 2 metal sides but Gamers will like the transparent side. It is one of the few cases including a DVD slot. There is plenty of room for wire management. It is a full sized case so make sure you have room for it. I usually use mid-tower cases but most don't offer DVD slots. The Zalman T6 is a nice mid-tower case but does not offer room for horizontal SATA connections.",

Minor problem if you know how to fix it. However, this is a major flaw for the average builder.I expected far better from Zalman and NZXT since I have a Zalman CNP9900 CPU cooler that has performed flawlessly and admirably for the past 20 years. Have given it great reviews numerous times.",

                "reviewText": "My last computer case had a serious dust and airflow problem, so bad that the PC would shut down due to CPU over heating. So I got this Zalman Z1 Plus case instead.It has a sturdy build and fits the hutch (PC compartment) of most computer desks. The glass side panel allows you to easily monitor the internals of your PC. There are air vents at the front, top, bottom and rear of the case, meaning great airflow and lower CPU temperature. The ports and buttons are conveniently placed at the top of the tower, so plugging in peripherals is much easier. Highly recommended!",
