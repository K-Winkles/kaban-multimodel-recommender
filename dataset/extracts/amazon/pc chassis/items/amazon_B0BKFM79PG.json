                "reviewText": "I bought one because I wanted a smallish case that could fit everything I wanted without extra bulk. And I wanted to go air cooling only. (I had an AIO explode on me once, and once was enough). And it does that admirably. I\u2019ve stuffed a 4090 (msi gaming trio) a 7800x3d with a Peerless Assassin (120mm dual tower cooler) and even a soundblaster in there. It\u2019s well fitted but not tight. And the 4090 doesn\u2019t get close enough to the front fans to block air flow.Cable routing is very good, but I did have to undo the factory default job and then rewrap it because the front panel IO leads weren\u2019t layered correctly. (A very slight nitpick).I also put a corsair shift psu in it, but I don\u2019t know if it is worth it, as the case has plenty of room for a cable mess (But none for hard drives!... which is fine by me.)I like that the IO is top front, so I can put it on the floor and move it to either side, and it doesn\u2019t cause any problems. And it\u2019s a full IO panel, with two usb a, one type c, and two headphone jacks, so that\u2019s nice (unlike the corsair 4000D).It comes with a pc speaker, and all the wires you need, so good on them for that.I wouldn\u2019t buy it for a dual rad liquid cooled system as it might be a little tight.I really wish it had some sort of GPU support bracket. I feel like that\u2019s a must these days. It has screw holes in on the floor (the PSU separator) and those did work \u201cokay\u201d when I added an Antec GPU support bracket. But they are very nearly too far away, so I\u2019m only getting 2mm of contact (at most.)The front panel removal for filter cleaning is slightly sus, as you have to yank on it to get it open (if the case is empty you could swing it around without it opening). Once it\u2019s full, it\u2019s easier to get off, but it also feels like it might come off if you are just carrying it around, so that\u2019s a bit scary. I would have preferred thumb screws and an air filter that slips out the side, but no.It\u2019s very open air, and sometimes I can hear coil whine from the components, but they never claim it\u2019s a quiet case.So there\u2019s nothing really fancy about it, which is maybe a good thing. It\u2019s just a small, full-featured, good-looking case, with decent airflow.Update: One minor warning. I bought a second case (in white) and had problems with the expansion slot bars blocking the display ports on the GPU. After half an hour of worrying the GPU had died, I fixed the problem by loosening all the slot covers bottom-to-top and nudging them down. It's not ideal, but it's not terrible either. They ought to use harder steel (and narrower bars) on the slots. That or remove the first two bars entirely",

                "reviewText": "For me it was between this and the Corsair 4000D Airflow. Probably can't go wrong with either but I liked the look of this one more. The 140 mm fans are quiet. Case is larger than I expected with plenty of room for an ATX motherboard and Nvidia 4070 Founder's Edition (2 fans). Cable management is great.The only slight issue was fitting a 3.5 inch HD. I used an M.2 for primary SSD but had an old 3.5 HD that I decided to use for extra storage. There are 3 screws for the case panel on the side the case that the HD is mounted on (cable management side) but I was only able to screw in the top and bottom with the 3.5 in HD installed since the HD was slightly too thick. Again, not a huge deal and I'd guess that most won't bother installing a 10 year old 3.5 inch HD with this case. One other thing to note is the gray trim is plastic although it looks like it could be aluminum. Filters seem to be easy to take out but I don't like having to pop off the front of the case to access the front filter although this is just a minor complaint. Overall great case for the price, would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "This case is good for a budget pc build. The front fans are a bit noisy at full speeds, but you can curve them down and you won\u2019t notice them. There\u2019s plenty of room for liquid cooling or for a big tower cooler. My 3 fan graphics card fits well with room to spare. The plastic front grill looks good, but I\u2019m not sure how it will hold up over time. The dust covers are magnetic and air flow seems pretty good. If you\u2019re looking for a budget case, this one will work just fine.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars 140mm based air-flow focused case with ARBG",
                "reviewText": "This case is quite flexible with lots of space. The entire case is based around 140mm fans, with 360/280mm radiator space in the top (maybe a 420mm, but didn't try), and 360/420mm radiator spot up front. Think Fractal Torrent but radiators actually make sense in this one. Should be plenty big for nearly any set of components. Total room for 1x 140mm rear fan, 1x 140mm bottom fan, 3x 140mm front fans, 3x 140mm top fans. There are two internal 3.5\" drive bays in the basement that can also take 2.5\" drives (removed in photos), and two plates that can each hold two 2.5\" drives on the back of the motherboard tray. PCIe brackets can be rotated for either horizontal or vertical card orientation, this works but not easy or solid as traditional brackets for horizontal orientation. No riser cable is included. GPU support bracket looks good, but we didn't install as the reference 6800xt is pretty reasonably sized. Every intake has a removable filter, often connected with magnets. Steel is not overly robust, maybe 1.0mm thick. Only fit/finish issue was the solid side panel didn't line up with the rear/bottom screw. Nice velcro channels for cable routing, plastic clips around perimeter, and a pair of rubber grommet through holes. All four included fans are 140mm ARGB with rubber dampening pads. There is an included ARGB extension cable allowing all four fans to be connected to a single ARGB header. Glass panel is hinged, swings nicely, latch is simple and effective although not overly pretty. All said, nice roomy case with a lot of flexibility and tons of airflow. It seems fairly priced if you are going to use the 140 ARGB fans and want glass.Most importantly, this is the first case that I can recall coming with a PC speaker in over 20 years. Hells yeah! For those too young to remember, PC speakers produce diagnostic beeps when the motherboard tries to boot. It serves the same purpose as LEDs on motherboards.",

I'll be reusing this for future builds, the airflow and temps are extremely good. Also it seems the back fan is not rgb, only the front 2 are.",

                "reviewText": "Cant find one thing about this case I dont like, Extremely ventilated, lots of options for fans, AIO, Power, RGB. The only thing that was different for me was downgrading from 4 front usbs to 2. but otherwise fantastic-1 Star as the fans that come with arent PWM Fans and are completely redundant to include in a case sale. All three included fans use a Daisy chain 5v 3 pin ARGB plug instead of a standard RGB 3 Pin, so the RGB wont work unless you have a 5V ADDGen2 Header to plug into. As well, the fans use a 3 pin for power so there is NO RPM monitoring, control, Fan curve profile, nothing. Its 0% off or 100% on. no inbetween. Thankfully I have a MoBo with more than enough headers for this, but If I didnt, there would have been no point getting this case as I am now having to buy 7 Corsair fans just to get the cooling and RGB set right. If you arent adding more fans, just want a straight wind tunnel through your case, this is for you. But if you want to make curve profiles, Fan ramp times and RGB schemes, avoid this, unless you can get the case without the fans :)",
