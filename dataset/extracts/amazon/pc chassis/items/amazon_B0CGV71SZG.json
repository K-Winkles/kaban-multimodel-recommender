Not alot of customers got this so I will try to give my best input. The frames are sturdy and it is considered a open case, but you do have side glass panels, just not sealed. All panels came come off if needed. The back is completely open (exposing most but also helping with exhaust). No fans were included with this setup. 3 fans in the front for intake, AIO on top with 2 fans for exhaust. I fit a 3070ti no problem but I feel like there is a bit sag. (also this case is on a tilted angle) Not horrible, but I got a RGB leveler to put under my graphics card that helped the sag and look. The \"back\" side panel has little room for wire management. You can get away with wire management but if you use psi extenders like I did, it may get a little crowded back there, leaving it hard to organize. Overall I am very satisfied with this case, the look and presence it gives off. MORE room on the back side panel would be nice but a solid 9.5/10. I wanted something unique and awesome looking, this exactly what I was looking for.",

Not much going for wiring control, you can zip tie it all together and tuck in behind part of the frame mostly. With the back wide open to the air I wouldn't recommend this case to anyone with shedding animals such as cats. Still, it's very sturdy and very heavy. Don't plan on moving this one around often if at all.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Was pretty easy to assemble. Couple things to note . Cannot fit front mounted 360 AIO with push pull fans and latest gen graphics cards. 240 up top would be best. Even then 360 still had to modify top panel for radiator to fit flush. Had to lose middle inner fan to clear graphics card but was very tight. Also no clearance in case for last power connectors on graphics card as mine has 3. Had to cut out piece of case to clear connectors could have maybe used 90 degree adapter but still not sure if there would be space, I cut a piece out because I wanted to use strimer extensions. That leads me to my final issues very little space between glass and graphics card had to fabricate longer standoffs for glass to make space for strimer cables, also rear glass very very little space for cable management . Recommend removing HDD brackets and use bottom area of case for cables but beware under case has open hole . Over all, all screws were there case looks very nice glass came undamaged . For the money a very good case . Strongly recommend 240 top mounted AIO and 2 plug graphics card for less hassle.",

Mind boggling.Other than that, it looks really nice and is solid/sturdy. But just be prepared for surprises if you order this.",

Easy to assembly and will fit up to atx size mobo and full ATX psu. One thing need to know is that if you install a front 360 AIO u will hardly have any space for majority of rtx 30 series gpu. I didnt install front aio and my Zotac 3080 just barely fit in there ,so do put the gpu length in mind. Top aio only accept 240 that in mind too. One more thing is it doesn't come with any fans plz beaware of that although the pic shows with fans. Overall is a great case to build in and is very unique nice looking too. Totally recommend.",
