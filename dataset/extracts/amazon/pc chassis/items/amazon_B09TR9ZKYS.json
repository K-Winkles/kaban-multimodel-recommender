This little peace of acrylic and the included hardware have performed flawlessly. It obviously is not designed for a full size 3+ slot gpu so I did fabricate my own anti-sag bracket, but I knew I would need something like that going in. Overall this is a fantastic little piece of hardware for the price!",
