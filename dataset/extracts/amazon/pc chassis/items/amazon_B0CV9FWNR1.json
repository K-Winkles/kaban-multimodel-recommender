        "description": "SilverStone's SUGO series is considered iconic in the world of small form factor (SFF) PC cases. It is known for its compact size and sleek design, offering a balance between space-saving and high-performance PC builds. This has garnered a significant following among PC enthusiasts and gamers who prefer a smaller footprint and great portability without compromising on hardware capabilities. The SUGO 17 expands the SUGO series beyond SFF with its 26.1 liters size to accommodate the latest and greatest hardware components. These include high-end CPUs and GPUs that generate more heat and require increased cooling capabilities, for this purpose, the SUGO 17 offers the highest component capability and cooling performance in the series with its Mini-ITX/Mini-DTX and Micro-ATX motherboards compatibility. Its 180 degree motherboard orientation allows the graphics card to intake air from the top and exhaust it sideways, this airflow arrangement is assisted by the included 3 x 120mm fans and elongated vents on the side panel (with 4 x 80mm fan mounts). CPU cooling follows an airflow path designed for intake from the right side and exhaust out the rear of the case. The right side is equipped with a fan bracket that can hold 3 x 120mm fans, with an additional 120mm fan mount at the rear. Both the CPU and GPU have their own dedicated airflow paths, allowing for a maximum of 11 cooling fans in total. This creates a dual-chamber airflow that prevents the heat generated by both components from overlapping. Additionally, the case can accommodate a single 360mm liquid cooling radiator for each component respectively, all within the 26.1L case size. Similar to some of the previous SUGO cases, the SUGO 17 supports SFX, SFX-L, and ATX PSUs, making it a convenient feature for mid-tower case users to migrate into this smaller case without having to purchase an additional PSU. The rest of the case can also accommodate 2 x 2.5\" SSDs and 1 x 3.5\" HDD or 3 x 2.5\" SSDs. Overall, the SUGO 17 is an excellent case worth considering for both current SFF enthusiasts and for anyone looking to downsize their powerful machines.",
