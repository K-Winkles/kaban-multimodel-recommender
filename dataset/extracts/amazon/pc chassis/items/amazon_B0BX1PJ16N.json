As soon as you unbox the unit, test the psu. Do not spend hours installing things just to find out the psu doesn't work. Look up how to jump the unit, it's very easy. I spent a long time connecting everything, and realized after, the psu didn't work. Was my fault for not testing it. Customer service was great they tried to make it right by sending a new one but I didn't want to take all apart, just to send it back again. Other than that one minor set back, all is well. The case is roomy, and looks great! I put in a msi mag b550 tomahawk, with rysen 9 5600x cpu, and plenty of room for the huge gpu and anything else you want or need to out in it. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Grabbed this case for a future build, so I won't have a PC built inside yet but I wanted to give some of my initial impressions.It's clearly styled after a big name case, which a ton of companies have been doing the last couple years. For good reason because it looks great. A miss here is they didn't go with the borderless glass like some others do, but that's okay.Ventilation seems pretty decent. It comes with a fine mesh filter for the bottom, top, and side of the case, which is where most of the fan mounts are. There's space for a couple 80mm fans to exhaust as well in the back. Nothing is restricting any of the airflow paths aside from the filters, so there should be an issue with airflow at all.It comes with a fan/RGB hub that has space for 8 fans/RGB headers, as well as two more slots to add on random RGB thing like light strings. The hub is glued onto the back of the HDD cage. That's a huge miss imo. It would have been cheap enough to make the hub magnetic and moveable.There are 6 RGB 120mm fans pre installed. All the cables are also pre hooked up to the hub. Another miss is the cables for the fans, io, etc are an absolute rats nest. Sure you are probably going to redo it once you get parts inside, but it's pretty bad. Theres not even an attempt to route the io cables, which won't need adjust much at all for any motherboard.Imo this case will shine for a water-cooled build. Checking tolerances, you can easily fit a 360mmx30mm rad with standard 120mmx25mm fans on the top, bottom, and side mounts, even with an e-atx motherboard.With that, this case is an absolute unit in size. I think classifying it as a mid tower is a bit generous, as it's on the far end of where I would move something from mid to full tower. Bonus side is this will easily fit any GPU, motherboard, PSU you want to throw in.Build quality seems decent too. There's not much flex outside of what I would expect from any part of the case. I don't foresee any issues with doing a build in here. Tons of space and plenty of routing points for cables.If anything ends up being a let down after building, I will come back and adjust my review.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this case cause I thought it supported rear fans, but it doesn't support regular fans it's way to small for 120mm fans this case only supports 9 fans top bottom and side not 13 like it had said in the description. With no rear fan support this case is only worth like 50-70$ not 150-190$. The fan in the picture is a 120mm fan. The buttons on the case are all messed up and this case looks used and it's all scratched up like it was someone's return. Took my PC apart to start building in it just to realize it was not what I thought I had purchased. If it was new and could support 120mm fans in the back I would keep it but it's not new and it doesn't support normal fans. This also does not come with an RGB/fan controller like it stated in the description either so the fans can't even be controlled through my mobo as I don't have that many RGB or fan connectors.",

                "reviewText": "I moved from a Bequiet! case to this. The GamePower Warcry is a really nice looking case and having the fans pre-installed and wired was a nice bonus. My old case was mid size but it was too small to have a water cooler mounted on top. There's no issue here and my ATX MB fits perfectly.I have 3 SSDs and they are all on my mainboard so I can't speak to the mount in this case. This is a wide case, wide enough so that the power supply sits sideways on the right side. I like this a lot. One issue I was running into with my old case was while it was quiet and I had a ton of fans. My 3090TI was always screaming when under load. All the extra space and a water cooler in the right place have helped quite a bit.This case feels a lot cheaper than other cases I've had. The internal metal feels thin, and anyone can easily bend it. I'm not sure which genius thought it was a good idea to shove the parts box in the little metal cage, but I nearly ripped a finger nail off trying to take it out. It's just small screws and connectors in there. This does NOT come with a manual. You have to scan a QR code to get one.So while this feels like a nice-looking case for such a good price, there were a few corners cut. Overall, I love how it looks, but the internals feel cheap and you'll have to read the manual online or print it out. This is a 3 1/2 star case. Rounding up to 4.",
