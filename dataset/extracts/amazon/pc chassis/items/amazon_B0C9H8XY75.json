                "reviewText": "UPDATED: This is a great starter case. It's not top of the line but you get great value. Originally I was less than thrilled because the case, while it does look great, does not have a ton of space for wire concealment. I would recommend looking for a bigger case if you have multiple hdds alongside a power supply with alot of extra cables. I'm currently using the removable hdd compartment for the extra power supply cable storage because there's not much room else where. If you only use ssds you'll be just fine. The fans didn't last long for me. One began grinding and the others' rgb light shut off entirely, this is when I decided to write a negative review because it felt like I bought a very cheap product until I was reached out to by the customer service team almost immediately and they offered to compensate to make things right. They also respond so quick I that I have missed they're messages for multiple days lol. That, to me, is top notch customer service and I really do think that this is a great value when coupled with the asthecially pleasing case. It does look nice and premium when you have the fans going. You can upgrade to higher quality fans later also which I'd probably consider at some point but I may have just had a bad batch. The case, even with the faulty fans, has remained cool and the grindy fan i can tap a few times to get it to stop so its not even bothersome while waiting for a new set in the mail. Overall the customer service won me over. Highly recommended.",

The power supply tucks safely in the back hiding wiring and makes it look great. Plenty of space for design and imagination. Great airflow as this case was thought-out well. Its huge so keep that in mind when building but has plenty of space for upgrades.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Overall good case, with some caveats",
                "reviewText": "Case is nice and compact for a ATX midtower. Fans are acceptable, although they are not PWM and run at full speed all the time, but they are still fairly quiet so not too bad. They would look better with hub lighting as well as ring lighting, but that's just my opinion.Another thing about the fans, if you want the front fans to actually breathe, you need to swap them from the front of the case to the inside of the case, preferably before you install anything else. In their stock location, the front fans are FAR too close to the front glass, rendering them useless. Moving them to the inside of the case helps this tremendously.The cable management is not the worst I've seen, but could definitely be improved. There is a lot of excess cable from the front panel and fans you have to deal with, as well as mounting the controller as it's loose inside the case when it arrives. Removing the hard drive cage makes this easier.When it's all said and done, the PC looks great and my client is happy, as this is the case he picked. I'd build in this case again if I had to, but it wouldn't be my first choice. For an RGB case like this I would go with a Phanteks G360a, which is a much easier case to build in for similar money, and of higher build quality.",

The fan speed is not controllable though, making for a pretty loud build.The backside of the case is VERY tight. I had to lay it on the wrong side and press on the back panel to get it closed. That being said, there are holes in all the right spots for cable management. The power supply and hard drives sit at the bottom, allowing you to route all the cables through the back. The only cable visible in my PC is the 8-pin power to my Graphics card.The tint is much darker than in the pictures, but I think it looks much better - almost like a translucent yet highly reflective surface that is cut by the LEDs. I would have called this case the Black Mirror.I did have some minor issues when I received the case, but the seller cleared that up IMMEDIATELY. This is probably the best service I have received on Amazon.$130 for a decent case, with 6 addressable LED ring fans, and tempered glass front and side?!?! how can you go wrong?I would definitely recommend it for an intermediate gaming build and some eye candy on your desk.",

                "reviewText": "Fantastic new gaming computer case. Really like it. Setup was a touch of a challenge but that is mostly because of figuring out the cable routing so that I have all but the graphics card power cable hidden. The one thing that was the hardest to figure out was where to plug the RGB control board... but once done.... it is amazing.Now... it is very quiet when running and the cooling seems sufficient as the flow of heat coming out of the case is significant when gaming. The magnetic fan filters are a cool touch.",
