                "reviewText": "The features worked into this 4U Chassis are great. I think that the price of the case is a little steep though. They are using pretty generic stuff and even some of the screws stripped pretty easily. I feel that this case should cost no more than $100 w/o the 5 drive bay. which is avaiable for aroud $85 at the time of writing. I feel like you should be able to buy the case by itself for $100, with one drive bay for $185, and two drive bays for $270.The included fans are cheap and loud. for $350-$400 they should have included quiet Noctuas or other brand name fans. I installed some LED ones on my own. They weren't name brand but they were much quieter than the 2 included ones. Speaking of loud, the built in fan on the 5 drive bay is the loudest in the system. I will have to look at swapping that out at some point. The switches on the drive bay offer \"high\" and \"low\" fan settings, but it is quite loud on either setting. An off switch on that would be nice.Cable management in this can be difficult, but I managed. Not my best work but this case is very easy to end up with a rats nest because there is no area behind the Mobo like in a traditional case.All in all this will run my plex server in my home theater rack just well. I painted the bay racks with black lacquer paint to give a cleaner fa\u00e7ade, and it looks great.Intel 13600KASRock Z690 Extreme Motherboard64GB Silicon Power 3200mhz (4x16gb)Silicon Power 512gb NVME M.2BeQuiet!

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Very good case with some caveats",
                "reviewText": "This is an excellent case for my needs, but it certainly doesn't come perfect out of the box.First off, ditch all the fans that come with it, and replacing them with Noctuas. The supplied ones are noisy and just flat out not good. You can probably live with the regular ones if sound isn't important to you, but the one on the drive cage is TERRIBLE and noisy, so at least replace that one. The drive cage will fit a standard 80mm case fan, but the included one is only half the thickness of a normal fan, so you won't be able to reattach the housing over the replacement. That's fine, just hook the new fan up to a header on your Motherboard and make sure no wires are going to impede the back of it.That's actually a lot easier than you might think since the drive cage only requires two power connectors for all five drives which greatly improves cable management and allowed me to tuck much of the PSU cable beside the PSU itself. I love the drive bay for how easy it is to access my data drives and you can quickly set them up to be hotswappable in your BIOS. I did notice that there was a buzz in my case recently that would come and go. I pulled it out of the rack thinking something was touching a fan, but it seemed to be the handle on one of the drive bays wasn't seated properly or something. I accidentally touched it and the noise instantly stopped.Another thing to be aware of is CPU cooling. I had a previous Silverstone HTPC case (the RM-400) and in that one I used a low profile Noctua cooler, but I was installing a higher TDP CPU in this case, so I wanted something better. Another reviewer mentioned the bequiet! Pure Rock Slim 2 cooler, and so I went with that one. He said it fit great, but IMO there's literally nothing bigger that can fit. You have pretty much exactly 135mm of clearance for the cooler, and I think the top of the heat pipes on mine are probably touching the underside of the lide. There's just no way a 137mm cooler would fit. Be aware that your options in the <=135mm size are very limited and the Pure Rock Slim 2 is not that great for a CPU with a TDP over 90W.Be aware that the Blue LED on the front could steer ships away from rocks. A piece of black electrical tape covering 75% of the LED solves that problem though. If you have LED lights on your RAM, cooler, or anywhere else, they will shine through the grill on the front. If that's something you don't want make sure to buy appropriately.Unlike some other posters, I had no issues installing an ATX board in this case. Cable management isn't the prettiest, but just tie your cables together and you shouldn't have any problems with them obstructing fans.Overall a very good case, but not flawless, and for the price it probably ought to be. Requiring another $36 in fans to get it quiet isn't ideal.",

                "reviewText": "This thing is probably my favorite 4U case. The 5.25\u201d bays up front allow for a lot of flexibility in what you can stuff into it. Being short depth also means it doesn\u2019t need a crazy big rack to go into either. The only real drawback is if you have anything in the left hand 5.25\u201d bays it will severely limit what types of pcie cards you can use. Longer power supplies may have issues as well.I am currently using this case to house a home server that consists of 12 HDDs, full atx motherboard, sfx psu, and an RTX a2000.",

                "reviewText": "Generally speaking, I like this unit. I got it to replace another rackmount case for the hot-swap hard drive bays on the front. The old enclosure had been through the wars, and wasn't really up to the challenges anymore. So this one is good. The placement of the standoffs was good (I've seen some cases with one or more holes just a little off, and that being really bad). Basically the fit and finish was good, although some sharp edges inside were unwelcome. The trick to disassembly of the drive bays was not entirely clear either just from looking at it, or from the instructions (which were printed in a very small font, and wording that left something to be desired). Installation of the slim optical drive was quite a challenge, and the instructions were little help. Over-all I like the unit and would get another if needed... and now that I know how it goes together/comes apart, it should be a breeze.",
