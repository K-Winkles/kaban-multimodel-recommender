                "reviewText": "I have put together numerous computers - at least 20 - in the past. I needed an inexpensive case to put together a computer composed of spare parts that ended up being left over from another computer upgrade.The Gamdias case was able to fulfill the job perfectly. Yes, the metal is thin and you can bend it with your hands if you really tried. However, all the screw holes lined up well, and the layout and design of the case is very very simple, with virtually zero wasted space.I like how the power supply cables are all hidden by a shroud. The white color aesthetic is beautiful. The USB ports on the top of the case work great at USB 3, plugged in correctly to the motherboard. Even the toggle button to cycle through the different LED color options of the case fans works as advertised.I encountered zero problems with this case, and ended up with a result that far exceeded my expectation for an inexpensive case. The smoked glass and LED lighting gives this computer a whole new life. Wonderful little case!",

                "reviewText": "Trying to fit an ATX motherboard, two radiators, and a lot of cables in this was pretty tight. Despite my ridiculous hardware, it was still fairly easy to build in. No sharp edges to cut you, the panels fit decently, the threads were cut pretty clean, and everything lined up like it should. Running a 240mm raditor up top, and a 120mm at the very bottom of the front of the case. Do note that if you run a radiator at the bottom like I did, or a 360mm radiator, you'll need to put them both on the inner side of the front panel unlike the factory fans being on the outer side. The plastic panel that snaps on doesn't accommodate a fan in that position, unless you wanted to cut it with a dremel or something. The included fans don't have any way to adjust their speed as far as I'm aware, but they're not too loud. Noticeable at idle, but once my clapped RX480 gets going it'll drown out a jet taking off, so I honestly can't complain. They do move a good volume of air though, and the front panel design is decent for air flow. I've had no over heating issues. Would I put an RTX4090 in this case? No, but it probably wouldn't fit anyway.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased the Zeus Gamdias White Talos E3 WH Tower for a budget flip that I wanted to do. This case worked out really great.Pros:- Inexpensive- Fresh, clean minimalistic look, excellent RGB from the included fans that can be controlled via the LED button on top of the case. Can cycle through a variety of colors and effects- Plenty of room between front glass and case for adequate cooling, included fans push air well. Noise is fairly isolated (not the best I've heard, not the worst, I'd say about average).- Tempered glass is easy to remove with thumbscrews as is most items on the case- Plenty of clearance for full ATX partsCons:- Case material is on the cheaper side (door, etc) but honestly this doesn't really matter unless you are banging around your tower on things. For this price point, it's good and it LOOKS good (does not look cheap). Pretty comparable to NZXT H510 series.- Cable Management on the back is solid and there are adequate cutouts to reach the motherboard. I was disappointed that they didn't use a completely solid shroud for the top of the PSU area as it does show some wiring and there isn't a lot of cable stow-away space at the bottom. I used the HD/SSD Bay for most of my loose cables that I couldn't zip-tie and the area around it for anything that wouldn't fit. Overall, as you can see from the pictures it still looks VERY clean, but that little bit extra is what you get from the premium cases. I also couldn't find an \"easy\" way to route the fan cables behind the back of the case.- PCI slot covers are rip-away, with no way to put them back on and not enough screws for all the bay slots included. So you may have some gaps back there if you install additional cards.TLDR: Happy I gave the Gamdias brand a shot, this is a very solid looking tower for this price point and certainly gives some of the big brands competition. This will end up in a happy gamer's home very soon. Highly recommend",

                "reviewText": "So I bought this case for a MSI B550M pro VDH WiFi motherboard, alongside a 5600 CPU and a thermalright frost tower 120 CPU cooler, and a 5700xt. Everything fits-just.Make sure to check the dimensions, my GPU length was 155mm, the max for this case is 160mm, and the CPU cooler fits with about 5mm between the cooler and tempered glass.The 4 included fans attached to my JRainbow on the motherboard, it included a aRGB splitter, so the one I bought in preparation was not required. The led button on the top of case cycles through about 15 different profiles, such as solid colours, slow changing and also breathing effects. Will check if MSI support changing of colour within software when I've installed a OS.The back of the case has an okay amount of cable management space, with tie in points for cable ties (included with this case) and twisty ties, though the back case does bulge outwards a tiny bit due to my cables. There's also 1 slot for a SSD to be attached to at the back. The HDD bay next to where the PSU would be had to be unscrewed and removed as I put in a ATX PSU from a previous build, I believe a SFX PSU should fit with the HDD bay.Nice mesh filters top and bottom of the case, and the front has great airflow for cooling, a slit on the left and right, and mesh design too.Overall this case is great value for the price, having the 4 aRGB case fans included was always a nice bonus, I preferred the square design on the front, as opposed to be GC1 (which is more rounded). The front of the GC3 looks similar to the beQuiet 500dx but only had 1 fan included, so this design was for me.Fast delivery, bought for \u00a345 early Jan 24.",
