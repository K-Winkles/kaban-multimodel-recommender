                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Love this case for many reasons first the price can't beat it! Especially with 6 fans included and 3 of them are reverse flow really makes the case stand out. Also has lots of room for cable management. only downside i see is no grommet for the cable routing holes but can be expected because of price. Overall great buy will recommend to all my friends!",
