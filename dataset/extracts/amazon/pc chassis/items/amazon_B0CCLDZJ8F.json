                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I saw this case when I was looking for something DIFFERENT. I didn't want another metal box, so I found a wood and plexi box \ud83d\ude0e.Building it was so FUN. Everything was perfectly organized and they made it so easy. I was going to transfer my current build into it, but I'm waiting for a SFX power supply to arrive. I was also amazed at the build quality and the super tight tolerances. I thought that thin wood and plexi would be very flemsey, but once it is all bolted together, it is very sturdy.If you are looking for a small form factor ITX case that's different, don't hesitate, buy now.",
