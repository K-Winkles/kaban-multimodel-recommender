If you need a frilly no-screws RACK-MOUNT case, this is not for you. Used to house an old Z170 ATX board and evga g5 PSU, now a router. Fans are remarkably quiet, get out that molex adapter/cable. Would buy again, but double check your rack depth and clearance, this is not a shorty.",

                "reviewText": "I had a need to put a desktop computer that was being utilized as a NVR server into a new 12U rack. So I went looking for a decently priced 2U unit and this is what I found. I was a little unnerved by some the the reviews that I read on it, but I figured what the heck, why not give it a shot.When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the case itself. The metal housing was very sturdy and I didn't notice any warping or bending. It is quite spacious actually, and since I needed to mount a nearly full size ATX motherboard this worked out quite well. The backplane area is customizable so you can use low profile components or you can use a riser which isn't included and I had no need to since I already had the low profile components and brackets.The 4 systems fans blowing from front to back were nice, not exactly low noise and they aren't speed controllable, but since this was going in a network closet that isn't quiet anyway, I didn't care. There aren't any real cable routing mechanisms built into the case so you are on your own to figure out the best way to go about this. having a modular PSU will be helpful for you with this.Only one small con:The edges of this case in the inside are NOT deburred or smoothed over. This means while you are working inside of it you have to be very careful or you WILL cut yourself. This is a bit of an aggravation since space can be pretty tight in certain places and you don't want your cables getting cut into by sharp edges and certainly not your fingers. I think some tweaking of the manufacturing process and finishing could have helped here.Overall it is a good case, and I'd recommend it for someone just wanting to rackmount a computer.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, it's not terrible. What you get is a fairly large, ATX-capable 2U rack-mount chassis with some really versatile and thoughtful features that add a lot of value. There are a few hits, but also a lot of misses here, that can be offset by the value if you can work around them.PROS:1. It's cheap and lightweight, yet comes with protective peels on all surfaces to avoid premature scratching.2. Quirky, yet innovative design that allows for a standard ATX PSU to be used, even with a bottom-mounted fan. There is a punched vent in the lid to allow fresh air intake.3. Includes (2) PSU extension cables (L and R bend) to allow power to be routed through the case to the ATX housing up front.4. Includes 4 - 80mm fans pre-connected to a power hub. (this is also a con)5. Versatile PCI-slot configuration. There is a removable full-size PCI slot plate (3 horizontal full-size slots) that CAN BE REMOVED and swapped for 5 low-profile slots (vertical). Really cool feature...CONS:1. It's cheap and lightweight, and scratches easily. There is a lot of bend to the panels.2. Construction is very rough...DEAR GOD, WEAR GLOVES!!! You WILL cut yourself on this case. None of the edges are rounded, everything is raw. Even at this price, I'm surprised to see that the cable passthroughs are not rounded or bent to avoid scratches. I'll have to add my own grommets to avoid slicing through a FP-header wire.3. ATX PSU bracket is not very sturdy and makes for a very tight fit if the PSU has a fan grill that protrudes even slightly. This bows the lid slighting, making it very hard to get the lid hard to get on and off.4. Instructions are GOD-AWFUL. Nothing is so complicated that it can't be figured out intuitively, but the instructions are ZERO help and more of a \"quick-start guide\" than actual assembly instructions. They don't even explain all the hardware they put in the package.5. It's cool that they tried to cram a bunch of usability into a \"small\" package, but without clear instructions, I'm not sure how you'd be able to use all the features of this case without completely disassembling everything. For instance, you can't use any of the front cages without completely removing both, installing all the equipment, then reinstalling both.6. Included fan \"hub\" and fans are really bad. It's great that they included 4-80mm fans and tried to make an easy way to power them, but implementation is just bad. Firstly, the fans are 3000rpm and sound real bad at that speed. The fan \"hub\" is just a power distribution board that takes a 4-pin molex (MOLEX!!!), not SATA connector and puts out full power to the fans. There is no fan control or any way to add it using this setup. The fans are also 3-pin, so even if you wanted to run them off your motherboard, you'd need to make sure there was DC control as PWM is not supported.7. The fan \"cage\" is a structural element, which seems like a good thing, until you try to change the fans...then realize you pretty much have to disassemble everything to do so. I was able to get enough wiggle room so that I wouldn't have to undo all my wiring, but with those sharp edges on the passthroughs, I was nervous.Overall, there aren't a lot of options for full-size ATX mobo's and ATX PSU 2U rackmount chassis, because it's hard to fit all that in one small case. RackChoice did an admirable job on the design, but poor execution and attention to detail make me wonder if there were too many compromises for a pricepoint. I would've paid another $30-50 for better finishwork, like rounded edges, better documentation and grommeted passthroughs.",

                "reviewText": "This is the best built 2u rack mount chassis I could source as it accommodates the modern hardware. I want to love it. I Do.2u and the rear i/o were the important factors of my purchase.BUT - Of course it arrived damaged and is way too expensive to be damaged... I had to bite a bullet buying this.Now I have to bite another bullet and find a cost effective resolution with the seller as the item is damaged (see photo) - or just issue a return.It\u2019s a shame because these things aren\u2019t just sold anywhere, \u201cthe perfect one\u201d is hard to find and are generally hard to find for appropriately affordable prices.This one is inappropriately priced.Hard to justify price.But good luck finding another one in canada with a rear io like what this one offers.LxWxH:It measures L= 22\u201d W= 16 7/8\u201d H= 3 5/8\u201dThat\u2019s 22\u201d front to back not including handles. Any longer and it wouldn\u2019t fit my rack unless I remove the rear rails. Lucky.There should certainly be a shorter version of this model.I bought it for the marine environment, but it\u2019s just too big for portability.",
