                "reviewText": "Great HTPC... nice design. Subtle enough to fit in with any room d\u00e9cor scheme. I built a mini-gaming rig with a discrete GPU (GTX 1650 low profile). The thermals for such a build in this case are not horrible considering it's size. You can add 2 80mm fans to the left panel of the case. I recommend using high static pressure fans to force as much fresh air as possible into the system. This will also help keep the noise levels from the fans down to a minimum. There is no place to mount an exhaust fan in any conventional manner. There is another expansion slot located adjacent to the rear I/O. I installed an expansion slot exhaust blower but it was far too loud and unbearable for my ears to continue using it. However, the system seems to do just fine passively exhausting as the case has a decent amount of ventilation and 100% positive pressure with the 80mm intake fans.Update:WARNING! This is a very long update. But worth the read if you are a PC enthusiast like myself. I have been using this system for much longer gaming sessions lately. Because of it's small size I can play games in the living room or from the comfort of my bedroom. However, the temps were not ideal with CPU getting up to 84\u00b0c and GPU up to 87\u00b0c on long sessions with the more demanding games. I tried multiple air cooling configurations with blowers and fans which were relatively successful in getting CPU temps within a satifactory range under load but GPU temps still were too high. GTX 1650 low pro is the most powerful card in this form factor. The problem is the little chunk of aluminum and tiny fans are just not enough to cool this card. Of course, I could just dial back in game settings... but I am too ambitious for that. It was at this point I came up with the crazy idea of actually putting in a custum water loop. I modified an AIO with 2 80mm radiators and an aluminum water block for the GPU. Long story short, CPU And GPU never go above 66\u00b0c in a 1 to 2 hour gaming session. The system at idol and light load is very quiet now. Of course the fans crank up during gaming sessions but is not noticeble over the game audio. I am a bit of an advance PC enthusiast so this is not a configuration that I recommend to the general consumer. But if you are like me and enjoy moding and tinkering with tech then this is a fun challenge with a very satisfying performance result.",

                "reviewText": "Nice modern case, about 5.5L volume, solid construction with thick aluminum panels. Glove tight fit for the core essentials of a compact Mini-ITX system: a Mini-ITX motherboard, a Flex-ATX power supply, a half height dual slot graphics card. Plus extra space for a 3.5 inch HDD and/or 2.5 inch SSD. Perfect for a portable Proxmox virtualization server.One shortfall is airflow. All that clustered hot gear creates excess heat; too much heat to push out the case's narrow panel slots. The system gets very warm to the touch.For better heat ventilation, with larger panel holes, I've switched to the 3D printed \"SKTC A02 Side Panel Vented (Goodisory A02)\" on Thingiverse. The 80mm fans flow better with it.",

                "reviewText": "The case is beautiful but not for the faint of heart. Although I have not built my system yet I have some components around to see what kind of challenge it will present when building. Originally I was looking a case big enough to OC a Ryzen 3400g. ( No need for this one for that scenario but certainly comes handy). Good size for some little fans plus being aluminum will really help for heat dissipation. However when comparing the performance I can get from a 3400g against let us say a used Ryzen 2600 and used GPU I thought about getting something a little bigger but very portable. This is it.PROS:BeautifulAluminum helps heat dissipation.Future Proof ( I will explain below)Cons:It will present a challenge to pack lots of power with the present technology.And this is where I start talking about future proof. Who does not want the power of at least a 580 or 1070 with a nice 3600 in something that you can hold with one hand? I do but the reality is that I see this little system as a secondary/back up system that offers portability. Once I built this little guy I will not carry my laptop. Sure my laptop may be more convenient but I will certainly carry with more power no matter what final build I get. Even if I only go with a 3400g with a very nice OC on the APU and very fast memory (and yet I am trying to avoid going this path). The thing is that this case allows me to have a path to keep upgrading my system which is something my laptop cannot do and it has already fallen behind with a GTX560M.Now a more important aspect. Technology is getting more efficient and smaller so imagine the possibilities that the near future may bring. Slimmer cards, less heat, smaller power requirements, etc. I will be shooting now for a 1050 mini or low profile which are hard to find but even if I end up with APU only the near future will give me more powerful and efficient opportunities. I do not know when something this small could turn into a main system but right now I only want to take my gaming with me at 1080p or 900p with medium settings. My thing is actually 3D gaming and for that I do it at home either in my projector, monitor or TV. I hope this give me happy days and will provide update once I built my system. So far 5 stars for the potential value and very nice quality and style although I did not get a manual for the case which would have been nice to get ideas about potential configurations (mainly cooling)",

I went with a Silverstone Flex ITX unit at 350W. More than enough power for the computer I built, but it's LOUD. Will be modding with a Noctua NF-A4x10 to reduce some of the Db. Otherwise, small, sturdy and would be awesome for a nice little HTPC.Great finish, small, could fit a small dedicated card.",
