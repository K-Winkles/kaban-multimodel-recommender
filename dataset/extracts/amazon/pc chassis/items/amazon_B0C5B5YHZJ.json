It's a hunk of metal with a bunch of screw holes and some cut-outs. But it just flat out works as an open air test chassis. It does its job sufficiently.That being said, the quality of some of the screw holes is atrocious. Nowhere near fine machine screw quality, and in no way matching the precision of the screws that come with the thing. Especially the most important screw holes of all: the motherboard standoff holes! I had to REALLY torque down on some of those stand-off screws with full strength and literally just force them through the metal. Meaning that they're probably stripped and damaged and not reusable, but they ARE in the metal place and they ARE holding my motherboard well, so that's at least a plus.",

Mine is the EATX version because my Asus ROG Crosshair VIIII Extreme motherboard required the extra large size for the South bridge heatsink and NVMe DIMM2. But this thing holds it down perfectly. There are tapped mounting holes everywhere, and in fact, on the edge of the bottom frame, are 4 perfectly spaced mounting holes for my 240mm radiator. Everything I was seeing from the rack mount vendors was at least $200, and trying to find an EATX server case that's less than 4U was seemingly impossible. This allowed me to fit my desktop with RTX3090 GPU and AIO watercooler, in an inch less than 4U space, which leaves me for room for my fans and drawers, etc. It even provided me a pretty neat second option for setting in my GPU. Mounted horizontal above the second PCIe slot, which I use a short riser cable for anyway. I'm not sure if I'll keep it that way, or if I'll go back to my gangsta lean 45 degree mount... But I think the bearings in the GPU fans will last longer horizontally mounted.",
