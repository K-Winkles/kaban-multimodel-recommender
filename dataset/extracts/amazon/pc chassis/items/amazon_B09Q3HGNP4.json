Maybe I'm just slow but the manual or leaf-let didnt help -- Use the product pictures on the amazon store!I have an ATX board on it with an ATX PSU. So far so good, happy for the purchase, the triangle supports really help and my hardware feels secure in the case. I have mine vertically sitting on the table (as in the picture) but will move it to be horizontal when I put it where my old other PC was.Good for bench and test machines, but keep in mind there are no rubber feet on the bottom so be careful not to scratch whatever surface you put it on. I'm sure some could easily be added.",
