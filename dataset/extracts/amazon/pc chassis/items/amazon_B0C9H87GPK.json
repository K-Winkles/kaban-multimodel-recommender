I use a vetroo cpu cooler and there is probably one and a half inches of clearance to the front glass and maybe 6 inches to spare on the gpu... Should fit a 4090 easy. EASY TO BUILD IN !!!! Plenty of access holes to pull wires through and lots of clearance between the rear panel and the body... if you take a little time managing your cables in the back you shouldn't have any issues getting the back closed or smooshing any wires.I think this case would be perfect for a first time builder because there is just so much space in this case to fit stuff and cable management is easy. All the fans and rgb works and was easy to sync...This case is Amazing !!!",

                "reviewText": "Although I\u2019m ashamed to admit it took me quite long to assemble everything, I will say that this case and the six included RGB fans are amazing and work great. They run quiet and everything inside the PC is nice and cool. The tempered glass is very durable and looks so good once you peel the satisfying plastic layer off (don\u2019t leave fingerprints!!!).The included screws and manual help with installing and wiring the fans, and the wiring is mostly neat and already tucked away for you, all you have to do is hook it up to your motherboard! I could be biased because I got this case for $38 after using a coupon and a gift card but still for its base price I would hands down buy this again for my next build if I were to switch cases.. but I will probably stick with this one for quite some time because it looks so good.P.S. For those who are new like me and are concerned about compatibility, this case and a few of the other cases from MUSETEX are available to select on pcpartpicker.com and will make the build process so much easier!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Better than the listing looks",
                "reviewText": "I bought this based on reviews, including the pictures in the reviews. The listing photo makes it look cheap, and while I can find a few minor issues that I wouldn't accept in a high end case, it doesn't look or feel cheap.First, it's study. I half expected a case that would collapse if you lean on it, but I believe the metal frame would take a lot more abuse than anyone should expect tempered glass panels to survive.The front panel comes in a sheet of plastic to protect it from scratches during shipping, while the side panel has protective plastic on both sides. Both are easy to clean, just remember to clean the inside of the panel whenever you open it, so you don't have to look at fingerprints left on the harder to reach side.Cable management could be better, but I found it totally acceptable. You might want to reroute the fan cables, as they're quite messy. I just left them hidden behind the right side panel.I have four SSDs and 2.5\" hard drives mounted, just to see how they fit, and have no complaints. It would be nice if you could choose to hide them without extra hardware. The 3.5\" hard drive bays are pretty convenient to install, as they're screwless, but cable access could be better.I think the \"filters\" are rather silly. There's many openings for air to come in unfiltered, and all of the front fans pull air from unfiltered openings and push it into the case. I've checked with tissue paper to see if there's any inward flow of air through the filters, but it's all outward, so the best you can hope for from the filters is that they will catch some dust on the way *out* of your case. (Assuming you don't change the layout of the fans)Speaking of fans, they all work well, and the novelty lights don't look cheap. The music reacting modes are cool, but react to the sound of the fans themselves, which are quiet but not silent. I'm not sure where the sensor is, so maybe if I picked a different mounting location for the control switch, it might react less to fan sounds/vibration.The controls for the novelty lights are different by the button on the case and the remote. If you don't use the remote, you won't have access to all settings, and you have to cycle through all of the handful you can access by the case button. It also doesn't remember your last setting, so you have to set it EVERY time you power it on. The \"mode\" buttons on the remote will access every setting you can access with the case button. You can also turn the lights off and on, and adjust the fan speed with the remote, including turning them completely off.There are buttons to select a specific color with the remote, but it only shows that color solid without effects. If you want, say, a pulsing red, you can't do that by pushing the red button. You have to cycle through with the \"mode\" buttons or the case button. It would make more sense if the color buttons cycled through effects for that color. Still, the novelty lighting is cool.I had none of the trouble others here had with unthreaded mounting holes, misaligned holes, or non-working USB or sound interface on the front of the case.I suggest checking those as early as possible while installing your components, so if you have those problems you can stop before you're finished and return the case for another.There's a small gap where you can see between the front USB ports and the case, but not noticable if you're not looking right at it from above.Overall, I'm quite satisfied for the price. Not a five star case compared to everything available, but easily a 5 star at the $80 price range.",

The extra included fans made me go with this purchase.The frame and metal did not feel flimsy, none of the screws or risers stripped out, the 240mm radiator fit perfectly and if you take all 3 top fans out, the screw holes slide quite a bit each way so you can get it fitted exactly how you want it to look. The sub-compartment for the PSU is also very spacious as well, no issue with cable management. I appreciated the extra fans that were included with this case and had no issues with install or setup. I only used M.2's in my setup but I never needed anything more than a small 'phillips' driver for the entire initial setup. Just waiting on my GPU to come in now to top of my build. Thank you Musetex!Would highly recommend.",
