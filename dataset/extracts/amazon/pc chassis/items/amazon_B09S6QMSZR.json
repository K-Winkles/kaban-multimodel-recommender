                "reviewText": "My philosophy to building PCs is that cases in their entirety are a hinderance to the performance of the PC. You should only ever have a case on your PC if your living situation requires it. You can't just have the motherboard unmounted though, that's bad for it and all of the parts on it. This \"case\" is the perfect answer to it. It's cheaper than any actual case obviously, less metal means less materials cost. The two most important parts of it, the standoffs and the PCIe card mounting slots, both do what you'd want them to do, nothing more and nothing less.I have only one complaint: the power switch you get to turn the PC on and off while it is perfectly functional does not have a mounting location of any kind for the button.",

I've subtracted one star for the complete lack of an instruction manual in the box. With the different screw types they include, it was initially difficult to determine which screw was threaded foe what part. Another minor improvement to the design would be to add some small rubber legs to be attached to the bottom so it doesn't scratch the heck out of your desk top.",
