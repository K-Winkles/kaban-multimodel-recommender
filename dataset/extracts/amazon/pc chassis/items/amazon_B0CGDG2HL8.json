                "reviewText": "I needed a smaller case to fit better on my desk, and my eye landed on this case. It's tiny, but classy looking, and i loved the full glass window on one side. this case is TIGHT. plan accordingly. ATX power supplies WILL fit, but are a tight squeeze. make sure you use a modular or semi-modular one.the bottom of the case is wide enough to fit 120mm fans, but the case is set up for smaller 92mm ones, so you will have to get creative to mount them. the rear vent will only fit a 92mm. depending how you lay out your computer you may be able to fit another 1 fan in the top, but as of right now i'm having no issues with sound or temperature with just the 2 fans. its a very quiet caseIF you have very small PCIe peripheral cards 2 will fit. barely. i currently have a wifi/bluetooth adapter and an additional USB card in there in addition to the video card.one thing i did not anticipate, because i wasn't paying attention (oops lol) is this case is not set up for 3.5\" hard drives! it is possible to find a spot to mount one with some creativity, but it won't fit in the intended spot, which is under the power supply.its a very solid little case and, despite its small size making it tricky to fit everything, it was easy to work with. overall i am very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Product itself deserves 5 stars, was missing the handle, had to improvise. Got a custom 80m AIO water cooler to fit, the case WILL take a full size ATX PSU as long as you can manage cables or get it semi modular as I did. Stick with fans 94mm and below. Will not fit a 120 AIO unless you mod the case. The case is Heavy, solid, real steel so mounting heavy objects aren't an issue. There's plenty of space to work with, just preplan ahead. System is virtually silent. Inside: Ryzen 5600x, ASRock B550 Pro SE (white), 32GB Geil Ryzen 3200mhz ram, 1Tb Hynix NVME OS drive, 4TB Nvme game & program drive, RX580 8gb, 80mm AIO cooler, 4 94mm rgb fans, 600w semi modular Apevia PSU. Love this tiny portable case.",

                "reviewText": "The GoodWell, I do like the looks of the design. The glass side panel gives it a nice touch if you have rgb in it. The size is just perfect for the MATX board. The standoffs were perfectly matched. I did not notice any dents or scratches. Naked, it is a very light case in deed. It has plenty of holes for decent air flow. Because, it is so small, I can hide the case behind my 32\" monitor and no one will not even notice it is there. I am using a ID-COOLING SE-207-XT Slim and fits pretty well. So, a 135mm tower cooler will fit just fine. I currently am not running a dedicated GPU right now, but I can strongly say that a 2 fan GPU will fit fin. With a 3 fan, you will be pushing it due to cable management. The carrying handle is a nice touch. Do beware that if you plan to carry it around, you might want to offset the handle as to help balance the weight when carrying it.The BadWell, I do wish that they gave an option of a metal side panel that had holes for additional air flow. While the size of the case is sweet, the cable management is right where you are supposed to place the ssd. Due to the width of the case, it appears it will most likely be difficult to fit 5 x ssd's in it because of the cables, unless you push the slack in between the ssd's. The case takes up to 92mm fans. I have a total of 5 x 92mm. 2 intake at the bottom and 3 x 92mm exhaust (2 top/1 rear). I do wished it was wide and long enough for a 240mm AIO (without modifying the case). It is a pretty tight space to work in once parts start to be added into it. The filters is pretty basic. I added the filter in the front and at the bottom. I would like to see the one of the filters precut for the rubber feets. The filter itself has double sided tape to stick onto the case.ConclusionDespite some of the setbacks on the case itself, I am overall pretty pleased with it.",

                "reviewText": "Wanted to go SFF without having to switch to ITX and SFX PSU, and this was the only case that fit the bill. Pleasantly surprised, construction is decent and has just enough room to work in, at least with a shorter GPU (I have a 4070 FE). There are a few sacrifices the case takes in order to make it the absolute smallest, but none were dealbreakers for me.First, no removable back panel. This would have definitely added some thickness, so I can see why they went this route. With some care and with a shorter GPU, there is space to tie up cables below the PSU (highly recommend at least semi-modular).Secondly, the CPU cooler height is limited to 135mm. I considered the Silver Soul 135 but went with the 110 for a little more room. You probably won't be able to use your old tower cooler, but those are 2 solid options for towers. Rear exhaust is 92mm, and if using mATX the bottom intake fans are limited to a single 120mm, possibly 2 if you don't need the extra PCIe. Top fans max out at 92mm, I was able to fit one right above the CPU cooler. Overall I'd say the cooling solution is adequate, just with slightly more noise from the smaller fans.Another compromise is the mesh on 3 sides are adhesive rather than magnetic, and when you screw on feet / handle / fans the screws pierce right into them. Might seem cheap, but again adding a buffer for all the screws to go would've made the case bigger. This ensures no wasted space.Finally for my GPU the 12-pin sticks straight out. This wouldn't fit with the side on, so had to order a 90\u00ba adapter that routes the cable downward. So be prepared for another small purchase if your power cable comes straight out.Overall I'm very satisfied with the build. Great case if you were looking to shrink your micro ATX into ITX territory. Corners were cut in the right places to reach an insane 14.8L size, with the price of entry only being a new CPU cooler and fans, and some patience to build.",
