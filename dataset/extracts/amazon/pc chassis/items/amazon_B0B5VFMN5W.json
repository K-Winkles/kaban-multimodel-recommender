                "reviewText": "This is by far the best MicroATX $60 case on the market. Comes with 2 ARGB fans for that price. I got the mesh but they do have it in tempered glass front. Both case have a tempered glass side panel.Pros:1. The 2 included fans are ARGB. Also has room for up to 6 120mm fans. 3 up front 2 on top and 1 in the back.2. Plenty of room for SSD's and 2 3.5 hard drives. Cage can be removed also. They only include 2 ssd's mounts which some might say is a con.3. Cable management is good and they do include zip ties.4. Plenty of room for a size-able video card.5. Solid construction high quality and I never cut myself on anything sharp lol.Cons:1. Not a fan of the ssd mounting as I was confused on how it worked.2. No rubber grommets but for $60 I can see why.3. After putting video card there is very little room for it to breathe. There is 2 places to mount ssd's under the video card why? I have no idea as it would make the video card work harder for airflow.4. Dust filter under power supply is removable but, is way harder to remove as it is not the side in type. Top air filter is magnetic why they could do the bottom they same is beyond me.5. Tempered side panel does set flush with case but be careful when taken it off. Nothing to hold it in place after you remove screws and will fall. Be careful! Tempered glass can break if you drop it on a corner.I really like this case as I believe it is a nice case for what you get for the price. I would like to see in the next version Cooler Master make the bottom dust filter either side in and out or do it like the top with magnets. Cheaper version without ARGB fans. Maybe make it in white. Options would be nice like rubber grommets.",

                "reviewText": "Build Quality: 3/5Looks: 4/5Airflow: 4.5/5Layout: 4.5/5Features: 3.5/5Overall: 3.9/5.0First off, the case itself is fine, and I'd give it 4 stars for the case. But a good part of the attraction are the included RGB LED front 120mm fans. BOTH of my fans have a very audible 'clicking' noise that changes frequency with fan speed. I check that no wires or obstructions are causing it, but it's coming from the motor housing itself. The fans look great and move air quietly, if it weren't for this annoying clicking. This is for a customer's system, not my own, so I'm hoping they won't care, but it'd drive me up the wall if it were my PC. If your more than 3FT from the PC and don't crank the front fans, you probably won't care. That being said, I've been using Cooler Master fans for years, and many of them have a very quiet clicking when they spin, but not usually enough to be audible more than 6 in away. This is easily 4x to 8x as loud.While we're discussing fans, why is the RGB controller a 3 pin female connection? Most motherboards have a pin layout for RGB control. I still have to figure this out. It even says \"Gigabyte\" on the connection, and I have a Gigabyte board. I wish RGB standard were more clearly defined,.On to the rest of the case. I like the layout and cooling options. For a Micro ATX case, this has very good airflow and cooling options. There is plenty of space up top for up to a 280mm air cooler, and the dual tower cooler I used also fit fine. It doesn't come with any rear fans, but I knew this going in and don't take off any points at this price point for that.I like that there are 2x 2.5 mounts on the back of the motherboard tray, but there are also 2x 2.5 mounts above the PSU shroud. This is fine, but they only give you hardware for 2x mounts, which is weird since there are 4 areas to mount total.I like the removable 3.5\" drive bay, and I like all the space for the size of this case. The layout feels very modern and is easy to work on.However, the bend off expansion slot fillers are annoying. They are hard to get off once a motherboard is in. I know it's a cheap case, but these should be screwed in spacers, not this junk. I expect this on a $40 case, not a $70 case. Cooler Master, charge the extra Twenty Cents and give real expansion slot fillers, please.Overall, if you want a cool looking case with good airflow and a glass side panel on the cheap, this is a good option. So long as you don't mind potentially \"clicky\" fans and some of the quality shortcuts.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great budget case to have. It filters dust in every which way it intakes air. Comes included with 2 front fans and has great support for the upper placement of radiators and decent support for front radiators. Has a pretty good space for large CPU coolers. Can handle almost any GPU size, there are a few that are cutting close and not allowing much airflow at all out of the card. There is space for 4 SSD-specific placements and has a removable hard drive bay that can hold 3 hard drives or another 3 SSD's. The cabling for this case is pretty good but the clearance for a normal power supply is about 3 inches with the hard drives bay installed but this is a smaller case and there is adequate space to put cables around that your not using. Front IO is pretty good having a restart switch starting on the left with a headphone jack and microphone jack, A lit up Coolermaster logo power button and two USB 3.0 ports. A pretty solid case for $60 USD and it only costs 20 dollars to buy another Addressable RGB fan.",

                "reviewText": "So ive read some reviews and alot of people mention the lack of airflow, I personally havent ran into this problem myself, though when I first got it both fans that came stock worked but only one's RGB was working so I contacted Coolermaster nd they sent me a new fan. Also had another 120mm fan from a older tower that I added to the top so 3 in takes (1 top, 2 front) and one exhaust (back) and my temps range between 35\u00b0-60\u00b0 for my CPU and between 35\u00b0-70\u00b0 for my GPU. My specs are,-Ryzen 5 2600-EVGA GTX 1070 SC-Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x 8GB 3200mhz RAM-Auros B450 M moboOnly other possible downside is if you were looking to SLI gpu's this case wont allow it but that could be a combination w/ my MOBO too. Other then that I love this case, its sexy, sturdy and does everything I want it to do! The front panel is pretty basic (Mic/head phone jack, reset, power and 2 usb ports) but w/ it combined w/ my MOBO's IO in the back its perfect for me! Would totally recommend this to a first time builder or another gamer looking to upgrade or change their case w/ a budget/medium/lower high end gaming build!",

The two included aRGB fans, tempered glass side panel and magnetic filter on the top are a nice touch. The fans come with an RGB controller as well which makes changing the colours/patterns easy to configure.A few notes for people looking to buy:- The PCIe slot covers have to be permanently removed for the GPU installation, so make sure you remove the correct ones. I'd also recommend removing the slots before installing the motherboard since the slots have to be pushed inwards to be removed (potentially damaging the mobo if you're not careful).- The front fans aren't PWM, but you can use 3-pin fans on a 4-pin header, you just won't be able to control the fan speeds.- The cable routing grommets are pretty basic, they're just holes in the case (no rubber grommets that are in more premium cases).- The RGB controller is the only way to change the fan lighting, so you'll either have to open up the case to use the controller every time you want to make changes, or connect it to the reset button in the front I/O for external access.",
