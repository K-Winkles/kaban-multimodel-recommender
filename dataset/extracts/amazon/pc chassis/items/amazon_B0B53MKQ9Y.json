                "reviewText": "This case is much better than I expected it to be. It's the perfect size for a full ATX board. Extremely lightweight and yet still solid. More clearance in the back for cabling than even my $200 CoolerMaster HAF case has and that's a full tower. I didn't even have to secure my cabling, the back panel just slid right on with no problems. The cutouts for cabling are also perfectly placed. And no sharp edges. It comes with a dust shield for the top and bottom. The feet give ample clearance for the PSU to breath while inverted. Best of all the HDD mount is removable. You don't even get this feature from most high dollar cases. The front panel pops right off for easy access to fans and has no wires attached (huge plus). And although this last point is subjective, it comes with an acrylic side panel rather than breakable glass, which sadly is becoming harder to find. All in all I would say this has been my favorite case thus far. And I've been through a lot of cases.Important:- Not sure if it specifically says two HDDs anywhere, but this mount only holds one HDD. It may be a communication issue, because the mount holds an HDD in the bottom and an SSD on the top, so it does technically hold two storage devices. There is also a secondary SSD mount on the back plate which is easily removed via a thumb screw. Additionally I saw where another reviewer wrote that their HDD didn't fit in the mount with the back panel on. This is clearly operator error. The mount has two sets of securing holes which are clearly marked SSD and HDD. Operator obviously used the wrong holes. On that note, I also see complaints about lack of multiple HDD racks and ample space for water coolers. This case is clearly designed for modern m.2/SSD storage mediums and air cooling.- Only comes with one 120mm fan, which is molex. If you want to take advantage of PWM (fan monitoring/control) you're going to need 4 120mm fans with 4 pin connectors.- The complaints about the ATX risers not screwing in are valid. This is why I gave it 4 stars. It comes with 6 risers installed for a MicroATX board, and they're solid, but the three additional holes needed for an ATX board aren't properly tapped. This is not a luck-of-the-draw type scenario. Every one of these cases will have this issue, so understand this before you purchase. To resolve this issue you need to order a PC screw assortment set with the case (link below). It comes with risers and nuts used to secure them. It also comes with everything else you would need for a few builds. You can definitely secure an ATX board without the additional 3 risers. Just make sure you connect everything to your board before you secure it otherwise you could crack it.Fans:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HC782D5?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsScrew Sethttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NPM8QWD?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details",

Also the other holes were just holes you couldn't thread the studs in if you want a matx motherboard or something similar. But with about 5 bucks worth of brass fittings all is good to go. You can definitely fit a full size gpu in this case and a 240mm aio if you are handy. Would make a great case if there was a tempered glass option for not much more money as a premium option.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a cheap case for a server computer that was just gonna sit in a closet somewhere so all it needed to do was keep the motherboard secured into the caseI can't screw in the motherboard into the case because the standoffs just turn with the screw. So the motherboard can't even be secured in the case properly which was the only thing it needed to do. I would spend a little extra money if this is gonna be your main computer case",

                "reviewText": "Info on Amazon listing indicates it can hold 2 x HDD. This is INCORRECT, it holds only 1 HDD, along with SDD if you have. Layout is suboptimal, as the HDD/SDD cage sits at the bottom right next to the powersupply where its cables plug in. This means you're doing component gymnastics trying to get things arrange, plugged in, installed, etc. Also, the dust filter on the top is a simply laid on top and held by magnetic strips (seems cheap to me & likely to get dislodged easily). I know you \"get what you pay for\", but there are better designed layouts in other cases at similar price point. Only positive I can say is this case does have room for a 2 fan water cooler at the top. Otherwise, it does what it's supposed to do, holds your components. If you're looking for smallest case possible to stuff an ATX MB and basic guts into, this is that case.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I used this case for a fresh build of some legacy parts and RGB. My expectations were low but this case surprisingly delivered. Great room for cable management. Being a cheaper case, obviously the metal is thin and the acrylic isn\u2019t the best. But it punches higher than its class. Look at all the other reviews. Has compromises but its a no nonsense product that works great. I especially liked the area in the back where I was able to stick the fan and RGB controller on a central spot to help with cable management.",
