I upgraded to AM5 and decided to keep the case because it worked well during the past months, first it was very simple to unbuild and build, it was spacious, cable management is great, simple to install rear M.2, plenty of space, but what I like more it's the motherboard orientation, the GPU goes vertical and the connections above, it was a plus for me.The temperatures are pretty good, I have the GPU undervolted and running the Ryzen 7700X in eco mode with -20 PBO, also I use the HY-PR RX Eco in the Adrenaline software with 120 FPS limit, this way the system runs great, power efficient and cool.It is a beautiful and different case; I am very pleased with the results of my build.Mobo: Asrock B650E PG-ITXCPU: Ryzen 7 7700XGPU: Sapphire RX 7800 XT PureRAM: G.SKILL Flare X5 Series (AMD Expo) DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) 5600MT/s CL30-36-36-89 1.25VColer: Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120Fans: AsiaHorse FS-9002 Pro (from last build) - Rear: Thermaltake TOUGHFAN 14 -WhiteM.2: Main: Crucial T700 1TB, Rear: Crucial P5 Plus 2TBPSU: Corsair RM750X 2018 model (from last build)Extra: 1.

                "reviewText": "This case is an overkill for most people but it does fit right in if you have server rack enclosures with glass doors. It does have upgrade options/space even if you don't want to go down the water cooling path. I do not regret buying it at all, I just hated paying for it, but I'd do it again if I needed another large case I do it again. YOU DO get your money's worth and mine has ZERO ISSUES in quality design (**less the seemingly out of place plastic top/cover).Case has lots of room, easy to fit things in, is easily accessible front sides and rear.Take your time with the cable management and do it properly it WILL look awesome.I'm not one for many circus / carnival lights, I like LCDs and status lights with purpose more than light shows but this case does and will showcase a graphics card/items and chipset lighting. I really didn't pay attention to or see much of it my other cases. The tempered glass is beautiful and it arrived in shockingly pristine condition.Glass feels like quality glass and is rounded, the retainers knobs are made really well and have rubber bushings to protect glass. ** HAND TIGHTEN ONLY enough to secure the glass and you will have long lasting bushings and never have to worry about cracking your glass due to overzealous tighteningI'm getting away from mechanical drives bit by bit as I can afford it but there is lots of space for 3.5 drives / caddies. Even with a video card and a Ryzen 5800 with big honking heat pipe and fan case dampens sound quite well making it quieter than my Cisco 48 port switch. If you need to stuff some card supports in there for these RTX 3/4/7/8 series bricks you have room to work with so it won't rip your PCIE slots out when using those cards (IF ONE CAN AFFORD THEM ,wait for the extortionists to exit the scalping play ground, especially when the cards cost more than or come close to an entire build. )Cable management is very gracious and easy to manage, if you go overboard you have places you can either zip-tie or bread-wrapper wire twist things downMy only cons:** I don't like the fact that the top cover is plastic. You have to watch your wiring routing and anchorage locations else you may have some pinch point in your cabling, especially routing it out the back/rear of the case, don't let the \"handle well\" deceive you into thinking it's and open path/exit for wires.Take care to watch what you are doing, you'll get long lasting case and wires if you respect it and know about that point, I caught it before real damage happened. - I want to save overs a potential worse experience bu calling that out.The pegs on the top /lid are plastic too, make sure not to block paths and holes with your wires you'll be lined up for wire retention peg/cover damage without immediate realization - I got lucky.I'm not a fan of angled USB connectors on front, would like something more recessed or flush, while convenient , I've seen too many disasters with snapped-off USB A ports. I'm cautious making sure it has good clearance and away from things.Side perk / tip - go do recommendation :)\u25ba For tile / hardwood flooring....An addition that I did fairly quickly was adding casters to the case.I sized the holes and depth in case went to Lowe's and bought casters to make moving the large beast around for work or relocation with ease. Casters only raised top of case to about 34\", 4 inches higher than desk so it makes excellent left-side table of a sort for documents I'm working with. - Don't stack anything more than a few pounds on top of case, heat rises and the case does breath nicely but also remember it's plastic and subject to warping with heat and pressure even with the good construction molded frame on it.\u263c For carpet floors vs casters - think 4\" carpet slider triangles for carpet use , they will move big furniture\u2666 House keeping after thoughts.... I'd be proactive and get a nice computer keyboard duster and start work every now and dusting the top of the case so you won't have to work hard later and get into the tiny 1/4\" vents in top.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this case to use with the Asus ROG Maximus Extreme motherboard, an I9-13900K processor, and a 3090TI GPU. I got an ASUS ROG Strix LC II 360 ARGB AIO for the CPU cooler, and have an additional 7 RGB fans in the case. So far, I have only put two HDD\u2019s, although the case will fit many more, possibly while using less fans.The case is quite large, and is way bigger than most will need for a system that does not have a custom cooling loop. I wanted to have the option to add on in the future; hence my purchase.The airflow is good, with a vent on the bottom under the PS, and two smaller vents in the front, one smaller one on each side. This is in addition to the large ones in the back part of each side, and a large vent in the back. I replaced the top two included fans with fans that match the RGB TT fans that I used on the back of the side panels. I believe that there are sufficient fan locations to move a lot of air in this case. I have not had any heat issues; however, I do not tax this machine much as of yet.The case comes with a lot of hardware to put multiple drives in the back of the side panels, as well as the two slots above the PS.There is a quite large compartment in the back of the case for all of the wires for routing. I wish that there were more tie off points, as those seemed somewhat lacking.The case is somewhat unusual as, due to the design, the external connections to the motherboard are all on the top of the case. These are then routed to the back of the top of the case, and are covered by a plastic cover. It makes things neat, and necessitates a vertical GPU mount. There is plenty of clearance for the cables, and I like the overall design. This design may cause some cable routing issues in the case, and could cause some of the graphics on the motherboard to not be in the proper orientation.The case is well built, and solid with thick tempered glass front and side pieces. It is quite heavy. The panels can mostly be removed without tools, and are well thought out. The front interface panel is nice and well situated.Overall, this is a great case, heavy, well built, roomy, and looks great. It would mainly be used by someone who wants a lot of room inside for whatever reason. If you have the room, need space for a lot of drives, and do not need portability, then this case will work for you also.",

I don't recommend 120mm liquid cooler for OC due to small radiator surface area. H80i Corsair was sitting at 43c idle and 78c load. I have put an air purifier next to the PC for better air flow which actually helps alot with the thermals pushing fresh air and pulling out the heat in the surrounding area. I was also running 2 3.5\" drive at the rear of the PC and recommend to install 120mm rear exhaust for vent instead of having just 1 140mm top vent. Great product and highly recommend for thermals. Please do NOT install 120mm liquid cooler if your trying to OC. I vouch for Noctua after seeing numbers!",

Pour le montage et pour ranger proprement les fils, il est extr\u00eament pratique !- Entretien facile :Ses grilles magn\u00e9tiques stoppent bien la poussi\u00e8re et sont aussi faciles que rapides \u00e0 nettoyer.Les trois panneaux en verre se retirent vite (avec des vis \u00e0 main), ce qui simplifie les op\u00e9rations de maintenance et de nettoyage.- Qualit\u00e9 :Tout est toujours impeccable apr\u00e8s quasi 3 ans d'utilisation. Le mat\u00e9riel est solide et de qualit\u00e9.Depuis le d\u00e9but, j'ai eu \u00e0 remplacer qu'une pi\u00e8ce : un des ventilateurs. Celui-ci devait avoir un l\u00e9ger d\u00e9faut de soudure et le nettoyage sans souffleur a fini de l'endommager.Les - :- Sa taille et son poids : Pour l'entretien, je vous conseille vivement de remplacer ses 4 pieds plastiques par 4 roulettes.Je regrette toutefois que les roulettes ne soient pas dans le mod\u00e8le de base (ou au moins propos\u00e9es en option) car c'est un peu gal\u00e8re de trouver les bonnes r\u00e9f\u00e9rences et tellement plus pratique avec des roulettes !- Les branchements (ports USB, vid\u00e9os, audio etc...) sont en haut et non sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9. Ils prennent donc davantage la poussi\u00e8re. Je vous recommande donc des caches anti-poussi\u00e8re ou un souffleur.- Son prix : il \u00e9tait moins cher en 2020 qu'aujourd'hui, en novembre 2022...",
