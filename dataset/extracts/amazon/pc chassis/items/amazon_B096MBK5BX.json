                "reviewText": "I originally ordered this for my new build, but unfortunately the cable shroud was in the way and would not allow me to get my 24pin connector attached to the adapter. I pieced the build out over a couple of months waiting for the best prices, and I saw this and figured it would look cool in my case but since I hadn't done a deep dive in the case and figured out the spacings that's why I wasn't aware the cable shroud would be in the way. That cable shroud should've been like half an inch shorter, but that's not the point of this review.HOWEVER, I was able to put this into my older build which I'm moving to a different room and it fit just fine; which was good because I had already opened and thrown away the packaging.Installation is easy, it's a 3 pin RGB header and you just have to ensure the adapter is fully connected to the 24pin header on your motherboard, and then set it up with your RGB software.It looks alright, but my one complaint is that the diffusion strip (or whatever you'd call it) over the LEDs is more clear than cloudy. So I have G.Skill RGB ram and the diffusion on those is like a thick cloudy white, whereas on this adapter it's like a thinner (and because of that clearer) version of the diffuser that you'd find on ram like that. Which makes it harder to match colors.",

                "reviewText": "[Edit] Updated to a more positive review after more testing/usage.Pros: - White connector. This was the only one I could find for my white build. - RGB, but you can choose not to turn the LEDs on. - The logo is easy to remove with a fine sandpaper or nail polish remover. If you use nail polish remover, be careful not to eat through the plastic housing!Cons: - Only 5 RGB LEDs, so it won't really match effects with more premium items very well. Also, the LEDs face your RAM modules instead of the case window. I could really do without the LEDs and the extra wire you have to manage or plug in. - Doesn't seat in the 24pin slot without serious force applied, leading to loose connections and the device easily popping out of the slot when working on your wiring. Yes, even AFTER hearing the click, it wasn't fully seated sometimes. - Wanted a fully white connector, so I had to paint the black bits of plastic.",

It all worked out for me in the end but I was almost boned. Luckily I had ordered a rgb lightstrip and I was able to daisy chain it.It does have both male and female connections but again they are a gapped 3 pin. Otherwise quality product and even syncs with airgoo rgb strips",
