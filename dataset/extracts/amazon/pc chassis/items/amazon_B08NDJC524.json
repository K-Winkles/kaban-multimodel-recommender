I have used many of the screws, but not all, and the only thing I have found so far that did not work as expected was the bolt holes for the PCI slots. Nothing fit quite correctly into those, but that may also be the case. It isn't a stellar product, but the screws seem to fit and work as intended. The base nuts intended to be inserted into the case to support the motherboard fit the intended screws well, and those screws also fit the nuts already in the case. I would recommend this product.",
