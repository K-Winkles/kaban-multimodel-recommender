XFX Speedster SWFT309 AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT CORE Gaming and Corsair RM1000x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply both fit nicely however I had to remove the HDD cage to make room for the cables. There was still room for 3 Samsung SSD 870 QVO's. Fans are super quiet and the ARGB works great. The door can be a challenge to put on the hinge pins. A staggered arrangement would have cured that. Mine is in a tight location so the door is really tough to get back on the pins unless you can open the door quite wide. For the Money, it's pretty darn hard to beat this case.",

I installed the fans you see in the picture and I am so happy with it. The door to the case opens very easily to clean and exchange parts. I like this case so much my plan is to buy another one and create a computer for my husband.",

                "reviewText": "After having the case for 6 months, all of us sudden the rgb and the fans stopped working. Giving more power to the fans from your bios turns them back on but then you can't control the color of them( I think its a fan controller issue) . I loved the case before hand, but now I'm iffy on it",
