                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Inexpensive, all white, and small pc case.",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was on the market for a small, budget, all white gaming pc case and this case was perfect.I was skeptical that this case was not all white because the Amazon stock images shows a black border on the side panel. However, after seeing some pictures from reviews that the border of the side panels are actually white, I gave it a shot, and I'm glad I did.For color wise, I wanted an all white case, and this case was almost perfect. Like I mentioned, the border of the side panels are indeed white. The only black parts that I wish was also white are the cables and the side panel hinges, but that's just me nit picking as most white cases on the market have black cables as well and I also don't notice the black hinges. The cables on the stock fans are also black, which wasn't a problem for me because I swapped them out for white RGB fans with white cables.One small note if you do plan on keeping the stock fans is that the fans color might not match the case color. In a review on YouTube about this case, the fans were more of a cream color and you could tell it did not match the case color. That being said, it seems like they changed the fans to match the case color because my fans did match the color of the case.For the size of the case, it is a rather small case and only a micro atx motherboard (and mini atx) will be able to fit, which wasn't a problem for me because that's exactly what I wanted. I was also able to fit a two fan (240mm) cpu water cooling system, aka an AIO at the top of this case with no issue.This case did come with two hard drive slots in the back of the case next to where the power supply would be, aka power supply basement. This is where you will find all the screws needed for screwing in the motherboard, fans, etc. (I spent 20 minutes looking for the screws lol) Since this case is a rather small case, I would highly recommend removing those hard drive slots (which is what I did) just so your power supply cables can be tucked nicely without inference of the hard drive slots. Let's be honest, no one uses hard drives anymore and if you do, you should probably stay away from this case or else good luck making the psu cables fit.For the back of the case, it doesn't come with handy velcro or a cool cable raceway to neatly tie your cables, but that's to be expected for it's price. I was still able to neatly tie all my cables regardless (even with cutom sleeved cable extentions!) with the help of zip ties and removing the hard drives slots definely made it easier to tuck in all the psu cables.One thing I absolutely love about this case is the side panel and how you can effortlessly open it to tweak your build if you wanted to. It has a handle where you can open it, just like a cabinet, and it has magnets to easily shut it, which is super satisfying. Another thing I like that I wish most cases did, is the opening to see the power supply (this is my personal opinion because I know a lot of people who don't like this feature). This feature opted me to find a white power supply, which was suprisingly hard, but in the end made my pc look amazing and added to the all white theme. Great job there.The only thing I dislike about this case is that some of my psu cables are visible through the front of the case due to an opening of the power supply basement. I get why they did that, it's easier to access the hard drives/cables and to make room for another fan, but I really wish they just kept the power supply basement solid. (I'll provide an image of this).Now for the noise level, it's meh in my opinion. Not quiet, not loud. Just medium. Sounds like fans spinning in a case. I can say it's definitely on the quieter side, but with that said, it does have quite a bit of air flow. For my rig, I had only set two fans for intake on the front of my pc and set the rest of the fans to exhaust (two fans on top and one in the rear). To my surprise, it gave out plenty of air flow throughout my whole system, considering the front panel has little ventilation.Overall, for the price of $70, I'd rate it 8.5/10. I 85% recommend it if you're in the market for a small, budget, all white pc case with no rgb fans.",

I definitely took the reviews into consideration when getting the case because if you want to have an hd storage, it\u2019ll be really hard with the psu cables trying to fit in the same space. I just got two m.2 ssd\u2019s. It was able to fit my water cooler easily with good airflow coming from the pre installed fans. I just wish I could\u2019ve put two fans in the bottom but I wouldn\u2019t have enough clearance for my gpu. If you want to be able to put two extra in the bottom. Than get a itx motherboard so you can have enough space to do so.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, this is one of the best micro ATX form factor cases I've seen. That being said, I do have a few gripes that kept this case from getting 5 stars from me.Pros: - there are 3 fans that come with this case. They aren't the quietest by any means, and I'm sure given the noise you can hear up close from the fan motor that they wont last forever, but they are fans and that's more than a lot of cases have at this price point. - There is a surprising amount of GPU room. My RTX 3080 TUF ASUS card fits perfectly with more room if I ever decide to upgrade to a 40 series. - cable management in the back is a dream with this case. There are plenty of mounting spots for your cable ties and while there are no cable grommets, there are a good amount of slots to feed you PSU cables through. - Perhaps the best part about this case is the swivel glass panel. Its toolless and amazing for diagnosing pc issues.Cons: - The front panel is VERY restrictive. One of the highlights in the product description for this device is the airflow coming from the sides of the front panel. In short, its not enough. I would suggest running intake fans on top if you want to maximize airflow with this case. - cable management in the back is alright, but there simply isn't enough space between the back panel and the area for cables. You gain a little extra space if you remove the hard drive bay, but if you have any thick cables (your 24pin motherboard cable in particular) you will have to push the side panel in a fair bit to screw it on. - The GPU brackets are fixed in place and once they come out, they don't go back in. I understand this is a cost saving measure, but it would still be nice if they were screw off. - while the product photos state that you can fit 3 120 or 140 mm fans in the front, its simply not true. I tried this and the third fan comes in contact with the cables up top for I/O. Theoretically you could fit 3 120mm fans in the front directly behind the front panel, though you would get literally 0 airflow from there as the fans would make direct contact with the front panel.This case gets brownie points for the price for sure. If you are looking for something to fill out your micro ATX board on a tight budget this will do the job!",
