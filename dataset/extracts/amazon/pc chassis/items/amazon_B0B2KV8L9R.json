                "reviewText": "Awesome case, very well made and thought out, super easy to build in and you can fit a rtx 4090! For the cpu cooler I used an Arctic freeze 280, in order to fit the 280 cooler if you put a 140 fan at the top of the case you need to put it under the top cover on the outside of the main chamber to make room for the radiator and 140 fans.Everything looks and runs amazing, tons of airflow so zero problems with temps, if you are interested in this case trust me just buy it, not the cheapest case but it\u2019s very high quality and thought out, even has built in cable holders in the back so you can route everything and make it look clean, also you don\u2019t need any tools to take all the main panels off, no taking out little screws and all that, I got the green color and imo it looks great!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Awesome case but with a few things to keep in mind",
                "reviewText": "This case is great, but there were a few minor issues that prevented me from utilizing the customization potential to the max...First of all, this technically does fix 360mm CPU cooling AIOs. However, they will *only* fit standing up against the side of the case. So you can either have fans facing outwards (towards the glass) and see the \"ugly\" radiator on the inside, or you can have the fans facing inside and have the radiator on the outside. I was hoping to have it on the top of the case so the fans pointed down so the RGB could illuminate the case. Instead, I have them facing against the glass side so that they illuminate the wall behind the case, which is quite nice.Another problem with this is that there are two USB header ports needed to plug in the USB ports on the front of the case... but my motherboard didn't have enough for all I needed. If you like having access to USBs on the front of your case, be sure to check motherboard specs and ensure you have enough headers to plug them in. The motherboard also had to go in \"upside down\" (but I'll blame ASUS for this one; ASUS x670e-a).The third issue I had involved the GPU. I bought a big chonker (AMD Ryzen 7 7800x3D 8-core) which fits just perfectly against the side of the case, but something to do with how it was plugged into the motherboard meant I wasn't able to fully utilize the GPU (there are two ports to plug it in, I initially had it plugged in furthest from the CPU; closest to the side of the case). I had to plug it in closer to the CPU which basically messed up the placement of other PC compartments in the case. I also had to remove a bottom inner panel to fit it in as it was barely (maybe 10-20mm) too long.Finally... one of the rubber feet fell off not 5 minutes after removing from packaging. Not much of an issue, but I tried reattaching it but it just kept falling off.I love how the top of the case has a panel that is easy to remove, but what I don't like is how difficult it is to remove the whole casing from the top. Especially if I have USB components plugged in. Remember to remove those before removing the top part of the case! The cable management is also pretty cool-looking and easy to figure out. There's a lot of space behind, above, and below the case to hide cables and manage in a way that's functional.All in all, I don't necessarily regret purchasing this case, but I am a little disappointed in how much compromise I had to make in order to get my PC to work properly. I bought this thinking I could have a lot of room for customization with how it looks, but honestly it feels somewhat too small for what I was expecting and thinking lol There was a lot of time spent on moving components around to ensure everything was getting adequate power and was positioned in such a way that it would fit and I could see the RGB and LCD screens properly (I have the NZXT Kraken Elite AIO which has the LCD screen). I'm confident that I can find other ways to improve how it looks but right now I'm fairly happy with it!",

Je ne le conseillerais probablement pas a un assembleur d\u00e9butant mais pour les habitu\u00e9s c'est pomal cool, ca fait diff\u00e9rent. le syst\u00e8me arri\u00e8re pour le cable management est tout simplement g\u00e9nial, en contre partie le cable management a l'int\u00e9rieur est un peu plus complexe du au fait que la carte m\u00e8re est a l'horizontale plut\u00f4t qu'a la verticalevendu comme un case mini ITX mais le format micro ATX fit parfaitement aussi et les support de mobo suppl\u00e9mentaire sont inclus",
