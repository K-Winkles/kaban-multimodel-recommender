                "reviewText": "An overview of the case as I got it can be found at the Overclock.net forums Case Mods & Cases section including much more images (or just google for ZZAW C2 overview, it's not like there is an abundance of information on the 'net about this case) including measurements and details relevant if someone is looking to mod the case further.As noted in the headline, the case I got had some minor differences compared to the images posted here and elsewhere on the net for the ZZAW C2 case. For example, the power cord extension is in this revision on top of the fan grill at the back of the case, not at the bottom of the fan grill as it is in the images here. I am not complaining about this, it does make more sense to put it at the top where it is less likely to interfere with tall coolers (although it will cut somewhat into the space available at the top for fans)Overall experience with the seller and shipping is good. It is a Chinese case so it did ship from China with customs procedures already handled meaning the only difference was that it took 3 weeks to make it. The tracking information was accurate and it arrived when it was supposed to arrive.",
