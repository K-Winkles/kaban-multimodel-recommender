                "reviewText": "If you look at one of my attached photos you will see two 16TB standard hard drives; two 8TB standard hard drives; a couple of NVME SSD's (4TB and 2TB); and 12 SSD drives of various sizes. My Garmin watch is attached to transfer my fitness data and it shows up as device D.Anyway, all the hard drives, SSD's and NVME SSD's are tucked away just fine inside this case. I do a lot of photography/video so I have an additional 48TB (six 8TB standard hard drives) tucked away in the upstairs closet.This case is designed to handle numerous drive configuration and does so exceptionally. Still a lot of cables but under the circumstances I think the appearance is great.A VERY HEAVY CASE (Steel Construction) but once in place, who cares?My only negative (a very small one) is there is a POWER L.E.D. on the case, but no HD ACTIVITY L.E.D. Sometimes I want to know if something is going on -- especially if what I am doing appears to be taking much longer then I expected. I will include FRACTAL's reply to this issue, but I just had a real-life experience where knowing there was something going on would have been beneficial.I just downloaded Microsoft Flight Simulator which was released last week. If you have seen articles about the download (once the game was released) many buyers were concerned about the length of time of the download, etc. Often they could not tell if the download was doing anything. I too wondered if the download was working. IT WAS A HUGE DOWNLOAD and install process. It would have been nice if I had a HDD ACTIVITY L.E.D. to let me know something is going on and data is being downloaded and written to my 4TB NVME PCI 4 SSD.Anyway, this is a great case and for the price worth every penny. Quality construction; well designed internal layout; multiple cooling fans; parts and materials packaged well; manual well written; etc.Lastly, here is FRACTAL's reply to my inquiry about the lack of the HDD L.E.D.Hello,The Define 7 XL does not have a Hard Drive activity light. The Define series was originally made to be a media center PC, but the product developers thought it would be annoying to have a light flashing while you are trying to enjoy a movie. It was added to the Define R5 and R6 but we decided to remove it again for the Define 7 cases, as it seems to be waning in popularity these days.So we decided just to have the power LED and if someone wanted to have the HDD LED they could plug the power LED connectors into the HDD LED pins on their motherboard and use their power LED as their HDD LED, because the HDD LED wouldn't flicker if there wasn't any power provided to the system.If you have anymore questions or concerns feel free to ask.Best Regards,ShaneUPDATE 08/2/2021 Since I first built the computer I was referencing in my original post, I have changed the motherboard, et al. I now have 2 Sabrent NVME PCie 4 drives; 3 HDD - Two 16GB drives and Two 8GB drives; and 8 SSD drives from 4TB down to 1TB. None of these changes impacts my opinion of this case - it is fantastic.",

                "reviewText": "Yes it is expansive inside, but in a well designed way, not just to claim a higher price point by shipping a larger volume of interior airspace. The space is appointed with useful features and extra capabilities. Love the solid quiet build that resulted from my Fractal Design R6 cases and the R7 XL is similar so far. Read good in-depth reviews on other forums, I can only give you modest advice on my own overall purchase philosophy for this product.Always nice these days to purchase some tech gear that you have a reason to keep, reuse, upgrade, not throw or give away. For me this justifies the higher but still fair price of an R7 and the R7 XL. In the future I may replace a video card, or add memory, perhaps even upgrade the motherboard in my system, but the Fractal Design case will see me thru these changes and remain viable for years to come. All the cooling options reinforces it's adaptability. Fractal Design's commitment to quiet computing meets my needs.Thank you Fractal Design engineering and manufacturing teams for producing a great high quality product.",

                "reviewText": "Big, heavy case as expected. Pretty easy to build in. Awkward to move when assembled as others have noted, but I like the flat top (that I can put my external drive doc on, headphones, and other misc. stuff on). The top mounted USB-C is great, along with the 2 USB3 and 2 USB 2 were key features in my decision. I'm using the quiet approach where I have the solid (vs. vented) top. Generally the design is nice - optimized for silence vs. airflow which I understood when I chose it. I have 4 hard drives in the factory default position and quiet fans. Since I'm running NVMe for the OS, most of the time there's not seeking on the hard drives and the thing is near-silent. Seeking/writing operations are noticeable but reasonably muted.Taking off a star due the case having a defect that should have been caught at the factory. It wasn't until I had everything apart that I noticed that one of the case rivets \"missed the target\" resulting in the misalignment shown in the pictures. I did interact with Fractal on the issue and they were quick and helpful, but basically the only recourse was to return the case. They asked for, and I provided, detail that would indicate which factory they needed to counsel. I decided to drill out the misplaced rivet and stick a small machine screw in the hole to help maintain alignment. Good enough and allowed me to continue the build over the holiday period when I had the time to work on it.",

Makes me happy just to have an opportunity to use it.I got the XL because I was replacing a old, but good quality Full Tower case, and thought the regular 7 would be mid tower and the XL would be full tower, but the XL is more than full tower, like tower-and-a-half maybe. After installing 2 3090s and a water cooling loop I am very, very happy I have that extra room, but it was more than I thought I needed originally.Can't recommend it enough. Perfect.",

Let me tell you they are amazing. The switch feels heavy, the case is subtle, understated and very elegant. Doors are solid the final product end up looking and feeling like a solid vault. It's more like a Rolls Royce than a BMW I would say. Very traditional, no RGB, mat black, aluminum in the right places.Only cons: the front door hinges are plastic. It feels cheap and look cheap. If you're interested in opening/closing the front door often to access the CD drives often (why lol?) This case is not for you.Other than that.. the pros list is just too long to list them all. From the perfectly placed and front accessible air filters (the tray is below the door so you dont even need to open the front). The SSDs bay are plentiful, really a storage mammoth for your most evolved builds.After owning Corsair 900D for many years I dont regret the switch. It's still a very high end top of the line product but less Childish RGB everywhere and windows and blablabla. You do have a window option if let's say you're a teenager but for the most part this case do feel more adult and mature.",

Back then I ended up buying other brands (LianLi) because of the lower price, better availability and same or more features. This time there were so little variants I just had to buy the Define 7 XL. I bought it for my home server because it has lots of interior space, a ridiculous amount of HDD locations and most of all, a very good airflow. My HDDs are now all around 30 degrees Celsius with 21 degrees Celsius ambient temperature (one older HDD is around 35, but it has always been hotter than all the others).I am very, very pleased with how it turned out, but it is a very, very heavy case, even when it is empty. Most things are screwless, like all the panels. The 3 provided 140 mm fans are decent, but I replaced them with Noctua NF-a14 PWM and FLX and it makes the case super silent. I absolutely love the case, but I would have chosen one of the smaller versions for a desktop PC. The Define 7 XL is meant to be used for servers or storage PCs.",
