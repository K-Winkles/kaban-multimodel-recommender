                "reviewText": "If you're building your ultimate dream computer, the GIM KB-14 Pro Magnetic RGB Light Strip for PC Case is a must-have. When I first decided to build my dream computer, I knew that I wanted a tempered glass side and the ability to change the colors of the components inside. That's where the GIM KB-14 Pro comes in - it's a magnetic RGB light strip that offers full customization of colors based on values assigned through RGB control software like MSI Mystic Light and Corsair iCue.One thing that sets the GIM KB-14 Pro apart is that it's consistent and reliable. I primarily use MSI Mystic Light for things plugged into my JRAINBOW1 & JRAINBOW2 ports on my MSI motherboard, as it works more consistently than Corsair iCue. The light strip adds depth of color and is super easy to install. I love that it's synced to the overall theme of my computer - in this case, Chasing Rainbow - and adds great richness and high levels of brightness to my build.I only put quality RGB elements inside my dream computer, and the GIM KB-14 Pro is no exception. In fact, I liked it so much that I bought three of them! While I only use two light bars in my setup currently, I bought a third one to use elsewhere. These light bars are magnetic and strong enough to be attached both on top and on the bottom of my case, and can also be daisy-chained to other 5V RGB elements.The GIM KB-14 Pro offers multiple means of connecting to different things, including a controller that can be used if you don't have JRAINBOW 5v ARGB connections on your motherboard. I have never had any issues with them, even though they are on for hours, except for the occasional disconnect due to fan vibration.If you're building a dream computer, you want to make sure you're putting the best components in it... and let's face it, RGB lighting is a crucial component of any dream computer and it's what makes your setup pop! The GIM KB-14 Pro Magnetic RGB Light Strip for PC Case is the perfect addition to your build, offering consistent and reliable performance, full customization of colors, and a magnetic hold that won't let you down. Plus, with a price tag of less than $16, it's a steal! I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to add a splash of color or another RGB element to their setup. It's like an all-in-one RGB light that just works!Just be warned: once you see how great the GIM KB-14 Pro looks, you might find yourself wanting to buy a few of them like I did!",

                "reviewText": "These have to be our favorite light bar. Not only do they sync perfectly with the GiM controllers, they work perfectly with SXDOOL fan/controller as in the last three photos we have enclosed. Just about any 6 pin fan and 4 pin led controller should operate these. These are also designed for motherboard sync, but we prefer to use the controllers. So far out of the several of these light bars we have got from Amazon, none have failed and they really put on a light show. To start with we set up a system with SXDOOL fans (this company makes lots of fans). Their controller is set up exactly like the GiM controllers_two 4 pin connections at one end for light bars. Then another system was set up with unique designed fans that have a similar controller. (Photo enclosed), both system of fans work flawlessly with these light bars. When we say 4 pin to controller we are not talking about 12v 4-pin connection. But these are 5v 3pin designed with an extra 4pin only for the controller. We have not tried motherboard sync with them, but in other cases using Asus Aura, now Armory Crate we have had no luck using such programs for any lighting except the motherboard itself. Just to add a side note here, we have never had one light bar out of 14 we purchased to not light up at the first part of the bar. You need a controller for these, else configure Aura Sync or Armory Crate for the # of LED's in the bar. I do know that Aura Sync will only half way light up many the led toys that you can purchase. Sometimes it does not know what RGB or GRB, ect. means. These light bars are ARGB. We highly suggest using a controller to run them, GiM, Cool Moon, SXDOOL, or other to see if the light bar is OK, then you can take it from there using some motherboard software program. Also some those controllers are designed where you can sync them with the motherboard using a specific cable. This we have never tried. But as stated before we have never had one problem out of these light bars. Actually we started purchasing them when they first came out on the market and there was few to none reviews on them.",

                "reviewText": "I just finished building my new PC and wasn't happy with the amount of light on the right side of the case (the Y60 has 50% tempered glass) . Due to the physical design of the case, light strips weren't providing the level of coverage I wanted.So when I saw this light bar, I thought I would give it a try. Given the low price, I was not expecting a lot here and was I pleasantly surprised! It came in a nice box and packaging with some basic printed instructions listing the different connection options.At first, I tried the included controller as that would have been the easiest to hook up in the Y60 case. However, the color options were not ideal even though all I wanted was the bright white (which wasn't an option). So I found a way to run the wire up to the top of the case and around to the mb ARGB port. I used some double stick tape to attach the bar to the side panel glass and that was it.I was very impressed with the brightness and the clarity of the light and as you can see from the before and after pics I have included, it made a huge difference in brightening up the right side of my case!For the price I think this is a great choice for those looking to brighten up the inside of their PC case.",
