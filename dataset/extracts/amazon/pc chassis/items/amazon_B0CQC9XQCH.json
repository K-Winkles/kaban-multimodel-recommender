It's great and comes with a screw case that labels what is for what and has cable ties and velcro cable management straps (already some in case)The manual is very ambiguous but after a long while with the pages you can kind of figure it out.It has a 3pin argb connector so you'll need a 4pin adapter for some mobos,Never used rgb in computers so it's a bit of a hassle for me with the fans.Other than above mentions, it's pretty solid for a case, with the 1st ground up build, I'm looking forward to my overkill case for years to come.",

I was trying to install an AIO, but it would not go back into place on the back of the case. Again, this seems to have been caused by it being assembled before the paint was dry.I should have known this was going to be a problem when I took it out of the box, and found that the cable cover door was not there. They apparently forgot to put it on.This was just a bad experience, and I would avoid at all costs",

                "reviewText": "WOW!!! I love this case! Saw a video on YouTube, and I said \"THAT IS THE ONE!!\" Love how the class slopes on the front. A true work of art. This thing is HEAVY!! It is not cheaply built. I had an NZXT Phantom full tower before this, which is a good case, but this thing blows it out of the water!! The PRO version comes with the LED controller and 6 fans. Regular version does not. I am old (56) and never thought I would get all the lights, as I said it is for kids, but now that I have it, WOW! WARNING: If you are older, GET THE WHITE VERSION!!! I got the black, and now that I got it together, I do not regret it, but what should have taken an hour or two, took me TWO DAYS!!!! This thing is MIDNIGHT BLACK, and it is really hard on aging eyes (and arthritis) to get the black screws and connectors into a pitch black case. It is truly a thing of beauty once you do get it together though. Fans are SILENT!!",

The giant glass panels shows off my build and is quite the show piece. There is enough ventilation for my AIO and tons of room to build and run cables. Would definitely recommend this case for anyone looking for their next build",
