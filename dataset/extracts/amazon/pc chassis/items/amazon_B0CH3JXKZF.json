The 4 preinstalled fans blow cool air, they are a little noisy but I don\u2019t mind. Make sure you have right amount of molex connectors, 4 of them if you plan to utilize all fans. Works with my mini ITX motherboard and my 2, 3.5 inch Hard Drives. Fair warning the case alone is heavy, so be wise with what screws/supports you use to hold the computer. I\u2019m very happy with my purchase. 10/10 would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "So, I got this for a pfsense server. It's been awhile since I have built a PC, and it shows. The case is quite nice, however keep in mind there are ZERO front openings, it is all power button, USB, LEDs, and tons of vents for the fans, for which, there are quite a few. So you will need to make sure you have every other piece. It does come with a bunch of screws and such, so as long as you have your components, you should be good. Now, with the fans, you might want to assess the heat you're going to generate and plug in fans accordingly. Just my $0.02 as the number of fans can make quite a bit of noise. Server room, no biggie, leaving it in your theater room, kind of a biggie. Use this rack case accordingly and I think you will like it as the finish is nice and has a professional feel to it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a pretty good 2U rack case. It's quite basic but that's not a bad thing. The fans are ok, not the quietest but easy enough to swap out if you want. There is pretty good air flow from what I can tell. I'm not running anything too power hungry but was able to fit an mATX and a few hard drives in without issue and the temps seem good. For the price it's a nice basic option.",
