But I got this for double duty, to hold a lot of harddrives and maybe be able to play some games. Be sure to read the specs/manual. Not all CPU coolers will fit. I did use a cooler that according to specs would not fit, but was very close. It ended up fitting, even though it was slightly oversized. So there is some wiggle room there. But it can get tight. Routing might not really be an issue since the sides are solid other than air flow holes, so you really won't see the \"mess\". My only disappointment are the Harddrive trays. They feel a little cheap, but are fine if you aren't constantly swapping drives. Would love them to be toolless, but they work for my uses. Case/setup was a lot quicker than I expected, even under load with the fans running high. No issues with the stock fans, but I might eventually replace with Noctua fans in the future. Yes the breakout cables are WAY to long, but the case seemed bigger to me for some reason so I pre-ordered the longest before I got the case.",

I used this case to create an XPEnology box for myself, and just recently one to create a Plex server / NAS for my mother. Seems a bit expensive to me, however, it works perfectly for my needs. ;)The case feels stiff, and I didn't encounter any sharp stops that cut my fingers. Just enough room in it to do some minor cable management. Not so sure the two 120mm side fans are doing a lot to keep the drives cool, but at least they're pretty quiet.The only thing I don't like about this case is that the door can't be opened without unlocking it, and you cannot remove the key with the lock in its unlocked position. Otherwise, I have zero complaints. :)",

Drive cage connectors are bunched together and makes for tricky cable routing, but not impossible. Cage not filled yet, so haven't noticed issues with drives getting too warm. Had quality control issues with supplied motherboard standoffs as some were #6-32 and others were M.3 but provided screws were all M.3 and would not tighten in #6-32 standoffs.

                "reviewText": "Well where to begin. Packaging I guess? Case came like 99.999% of cases I've ever ordered for builds. Nicely protected even when tested by UPS. I don't know why but UPS loves dropping/stabbing/rolling my computer cases around whenever they're the ones to deliver them. The boxes are pretty beat up and this was no exception. Looked like something tried stabbing it through the top. BUT there was no damage. Plenty of foam and the case was wrapped in that foamy plastic sheet stuff some makers use.I guess build quality and building it out next. Aside from the drive sleds everything is metal. I did find one corner near the power supply that was particularly sharp and dang near cut myself on it but other than that just nice metal everywhere. The front IO and USB cables are plenty long. I'm pretty certain I could route the USB cable out a PCI slot and back in and still reach if I wanted to. Just had to leave a larger loop of it in the back of the case. The hot swap bays while feeling somewhat cheap with plastic sleds without hard drives feel plenty sturdy with 3.5\" drives install on them. Which leads into building it. Was alright. Somethings were annoying like where the Sata ports were on my motherboard and where the wire routing holes were. Prolly would've been smarter to plug the Sata cables in first before installing the motherboard but live and learn right? Other than that small hiccup there's plenty of space everywhere else. The wire routing holes could be lined in rubber like high end cases but that's just a niggle I can think of off the top of my head.Now onto performance. Some reviewers have stated that the drive bay can get toasty and indeed they are correct. In stock configuration. Transferring all my files to the raid arrays I had built with 6 out of the 8 disks installed sitting at 100% usage the temps did get warmer than what I'm used to. Instead of trashing the cage and cutting the holes in it I turned the top fan blowing air into the hard drive cages around to pull the air out. So bottom is pulling air in and the warm air that rises is gettting pulled up by the top fan. BAM problem solved temps dropped 10-15 degrees on all the drives. Other than that and with just the single exhaust fan on the rear your CPU and rest of the system can also get more toasty than what people are used to. Sadly I don't think there's a real remedy to this since the case only has spots for 3 fans and 2 of those are for the hot swap bay. BUT in my case it's not a terrible deal because the rest of the system will never sit at 100% usage for any prolong period. Just don't try to build a gaming rig in this, really really really bad idea imho.If you're looking for a server case that isn't a rack mount server case I don't think you can go wrong here as long as you understand that the rest of the system outside of the hot swap bay has pretty poor ventilation. And turn one of the fans around for the hot swap bay unless you're fine with high 30's/low 40's for idle drive temps. If you want a gaming PC case look elsewhere lol.",

                "reviewText": "TL;DR - Buy an old school case with a bunch of 5.25in bays and pop hot swap chassis in that. You\u2019re modular and repairable at that point and drive airflow will be better.I wanted to love this case. It\u2019s unique. It would seemingly be perfect for a home server but the quality and engineering is way off.Positives:- It has 8 hot swap trays that accommodate 2.5 or 3.5in drives.- Comes with fans.Flaws:- Capacitors are barely on the backplane. You\u2019ll be running a lot of cables near them and looking at them sideways could break them off the board.- Airflow is poor. This is covered better in other reviews.- Flimsy side panels and overall construction. It\u2019s a server you say, but move that puppy with 13 drives in it (3.5x3 in 5.25 bays and 2x2.5 in PCI hotswap bays) and there is real fear of it going all beer can on you.- It\u2019s actually kind of a cramped build. Even with a M-ATX board and a single HBA you\u2019ll be fearing those evil capacitors.- Before you buy email SilverStone about the replacement process, timing and availability of backplane parts. Now think about how you\u2019ll use your NAS for that long when the backplane fails.- I know I\u2019m going all retrogrouch here, but this is a case that needs a traditional top mount PSU. Vacuuming your floor isn\u2019t for servers. I can\u2019t wait for this fad to die...",

I can only assume the computer market is presently being pushed by the short visioned gamers which is really hurting developing decent cases like this. Love the product works perfectly for me. I've packed it totally with disks and don't have any heat issues. Then again, I'm no gamer, so I don't have a GPU card for COD and nor am I bit coin mining....",

                "reviewText": "Let me start off by saying what a pleasant surprise to receive this just before Christmas! Yes, that has nothing to do with the product itself, but, the original estimated delivery date was well after Christmas.About the case, I was less enthusiastic with the steel composition because it felt rather light and flimsy. As well, I would have preferred if they designed the USB ports to work both with individual USB connectors or a dual USB 19-pin connector. That would have made it much more flexible as opposed to either a dual USB 3.0 connection or nothing. They should have also made the drive sleds work without screws. This way it's more efficient changing drives plus you don't need to worry about misplacing or storing the screws. With all that said, you really need to consider the price relative to what you get, and I'd say in that regards, it was well worth it. I couldn't find another case that accommodates 8 hotswap drives for this price so yes, they definitely cut corners. At the same time, SilverStone certainly designed it quite well with what they had to work with.I migrated all components from my existing server to this new case because of the ease that hotswap provides. Now that I've done this, if I were to do it again, the only thing I'd do differently is attach the SATA cables for the extra 5.25\" drive bays before installing the motherboard. The reason is because my motherboard's SATA ports are all located directly behind the hotswap backplane, only leaving about 2 centimeters between. As a result, connecting the SATA cables became a struggle since I was not willing to disassemble everything to take the motherboard out.If you've had experience in a commercial environment, set your expectations proportionately as this is not designed for that. It has many of the features but costs had to be cut in order to target the home environment. I would certainly buy it again and would recommend this case to others.2019-01-04: After doing some more research on this case, I found a review which was very useful. I did not do everything he suggested, but, just through the use of duct tape, I was able to drop the temperature of all my drives by minimum 2 degrees Celsius each! There's definitely room for case improvements and it's fairly simple yet effective. I can't link to the other review but Google \"dmacias unraid Silverstone CS380\" and it should be the first result.",
