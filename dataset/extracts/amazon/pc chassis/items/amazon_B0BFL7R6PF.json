This thing is huge and looks absolutely beautiful anywhere you put it. It becomes a piece of furniture because of it's size. It's almost double the width of my last build due to the 9 fans it houses. It's glass side and front panels allows for admiring your creation. That's tempered glass and not plexiglass, polycarbonate or other plastic. It's glass and sparkles when it's clean. I rate it 5 \u2b50 and \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d I hope they stay in business for when I need to build another computer. If you need a computer case BUY IT it's gorgeous!",

                "reviewText": "Awesome case for what it is. I purchased a MSI RTX 3080 Suprim and it was 2\u201d longer than my Gigabyte 3070. In my old case had roughly 3/8\u201d space betweeen the end of the card and my 360 Rad. I wanted lian li, but it was a bit more and did not include fans. This one came with 9 ARGB fans! Everything fit great. 360 on top. Plenty of room in the back to hide cables.I give it 4 outta 5 because even though it comes with the 9 argb fans and a controller. You don\u2019t have any PWR management with the fans. You control the speed with the remote provided. The controller also has pre programmed light effects as well. But the control box does have an ARGB plug to control with your choice of lighting software.Also to note, you have to use the fan controller provided being the fans are 6 wire fans, not the standard 4 pin.If your looking for a budget open concept case I\u2019d definitely recommend this one.",

This is the first PC I've ever put together so be easy on my cable management \ud83e\udd23 all in all it was a positive experience putting this thing together does feel a little cheap but it is a cheap case the magnets could be stronger but it's a cheap case the metal could be thicker but it's a cheap case I could cry and complain all I want but I got exactly what I paid for and then some. I bought nine fans and I got a computer case for free. It doesn't have any fan filters though so I will have to buy those. When I upgraded my graphics card in my last case I was overheating this one seems to have damn good airflow. all in all would buy again",

                "reviewText": "Most notably, you\u2019re probably going to have to take all the fans out and orient them properly, especially if you\u2019re installing an AIO liquid cooler. They all came installed as exhaust! So dumb! So i installed the fans that came with my IOA in the top as the same orientation so you could avoid a bit of work if you just have a stock cooler/ air cooler. BUT EVERY OTHER FAN U WILL HAVE TO FLIP AROUND. If you leave them as is, you will have massive dust problems because with all fans exhausting, air will come in through openings without dust filters on them. 9 fans 3 sets of 3 is just dumb in the fist place if you have 2 sets intaking and 1 set exhausting theres going to be a lot of positive pressure. I recommend also installing a fan at the back for exhaust, I used one from the top that i replaced with my AIO fans. I literally had to take out every single fan and orient it properly. Just a nightmare and a lot of extra work.Also cable management is quite the endeavor with this many fans. And you probably dont even need this many fans so you\u2019re waisting a bit of money on looks.Oh and one last thing, the case is a bit smaller that i thought it would be, was a little tricky getting a full size ATX mobo in there.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start off with the Good things about this case. It looks AMAZING! Thats where the good things end...This has got to be the worst case to build in and has so many flaws to it. First thing I noticed when I first got the case was it has a swinging door to open, which is okay? Personally not a fan and wish I knew before I bought it and maybe some people will like it. It is removable too. 2nd thing I notice is there is ZERO dust filters in this case, which to me is absurd.I also noticed that this case is different from other reviewers which is totally odd?Build Quality is okay, it's Not good but it's also not bad. My case only holds 9 fans, you can not put a 10th fan in the back unless you want to drill holes in the case. The GPU brackets are the type you break off and can not re-screw.Now the absolute worst part of this case, building in it. IVE NEVER SEEN A CASE WHERE YOU HAVE TO INSTALL THE HARD DRIVE BEFORE YOU PUT THE MOTHERBOARD IN. The screws to put the hard drive in is right behind the motherboard and Ive had to at-least take the motherboard off 3 times because the way you mount this hard-drive, the connectors are FACING THE WALL, making it impossible to plug in the SATA power cable without installing it in with the hard-drive! Cable managing in the case is terrible. You WILL have a rats nest no matter how hard you cable manage. Theres also a extra mount for sdd's that right in the middle of where you would cable manage and it's an absolute pain.Overall I give it like a 5/10 because the looks make up for a day of headache. Out of all the PC builds Ive done, this one build took me 10+ hours to do where it would normally take me at-least hours. If you are looking for a Lian-li type case, Id personally look somewhere else or just spend the extra $50. Trust me, I wish I did...",
