        "description": "In 2019, SilverStone released a complete high-end server chassis which served as a dual-purpose chassis for industrial rackmount or high-end home system usage \u2013 the RM42-502, main feature being support up to 240mm liquid cooling radiators which was rare to see in server chassis\u2019 at the time. Fast forward to 2022, SilverStone is releasing a new server chassis as an enhanced version of the RM42-502 \u2013 RM4, with better cooling, greater storage options and most importantly, greater clearance for today\u2019s high-end graphics card. The RM44 is designed for space optimization which supports up to 360mm radiators, motherboard up to SSI-EEB and graphics cards lengths of up to 424mm. There is an expansion card retainer in both the RM42-502 and RM44 but in the RM44, there are added mounting holes for an additional 3 x 2.5\" or 2 x 3.5\" drives; a tremendous and highly functional addition to an industrial rackmount chassis, making this 4U rackmount chassis unparalleled in compactness and space utilization.",

                "reviewText": "Really well-made case with solid materials and zero defects. The lockable front door is a nice touch, even if it's left unlocked, because it prevents accidental power or reset button presses.The inclusion of 2 network activity lights on the front panel is a nice touch, but I have yet to configure a motherboard that includes pinouts for network activity. (A shame.)Although the case is touted as being perfect for large radiators, and even though they are correct that radiators will fit well, I wouldn't recommend it. That's because putting a radiator on the front of the case forces you to suck hot air into the case (through the radiator), because in a rack you would never blow hot air into the front of the rack. You always want air to flow front to back. So forget the liquid cooling and put three 120mm fans inside, across the front of the case.A Noctua NH-D9L CPU cooler fits nicely, but then again YMMV because if you install any 3.5\" hard drives you need to be careful about cooler height. (I only use m.2 SSDs these days, so it is not an issue for me.)Silverstone generally makes quality products, and this case is no exception.",

                "reviewText": "This case has been great to work with. Super easy. A ton of space. Was easier to install my 360 mm AIO than in a regular case.However, if you are going to buy this please be careful of GPU height and length. I bought an ASUS TUF RTX 4090 but I had only a few mm of clearance above the card. I thought I couldn't plug in a cable and close the lid. after some careful smushing down of the 12VHPWR cable, the GPU actually does fit in the case.If your GPU height is any taller than the ASUS TUF RTX 4090/4080 it will NOT fit in this chassis. Please make sure your power cable is plugged in securely after bending it and you should not have a problem!I honestly think the RTX 4090/4080 FE is the ONLY version of the 4090/4080 that will fit in the case comfortably. If you pick up CableMod's 180 degree adapter, you should have a much easier time fitting in the larger 4000 series cards.",

                "reviewText": "You are essentially paying 3x what you would pay for a similar workstation case for the privilege of being able to rack mount the system (and that doesn't even include the cost of rails). If being able to rackmount a case that has support for liquid cooling is important to you, the case is very good quality and was easy to build in. It can be used up-right using the included legs, but if you are not rackmounting, you can get much better value from a workstation case.",
