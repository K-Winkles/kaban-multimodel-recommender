        "description": "To fulfill the needs of enthusiasts looking for a compact, flexible NAS tower chassis, SilverStone designed the CS380. With the ability to accommodate standard components such as ATX motherboards, standard ATX (PS2) power supplies, dual 5.25\u201d drive bays, standard-sized expansion cards, and even liquid coolers, the CS380 can easily meet the demands for majority of NAS builds. Equipped with two 120mm intake fans, a 120mm rear exhaust fan, and easily removable filters, keeping everything cool and dust-free is as easy as in any SilverStone premium chassis. Safety features such as lockable front door and power button are also included. Completing a great chassis structure is a modular, eight hot-swappable drive cage design that support both 3.5\u201d and 2.5\u201d drives. It utilizes a custom backplane supporting both SATA and SAS interfaces for increased compatibly with nearly all modern hard drives or SSDs. With a size that is nearly identical to most ATX mid towers, the space-saving CS380 is perfect for anyone looking to build a powerful NAS for home or office.",

Temps were within range without it but I was not liking 46c on 1 or 2 of the drives. doing this made the temps drop by 10 degrees C. The initial case is light, this is nice considering the 11 drives I installed into it. Keep in mind that this case will become very front heavy.",

The panels on the side of the case popping out the way they do is really odd and the internal position of the fans for the drives doesn't line up with the mesh on the side of the case. It's kind of like they shoehorned a bunch of random parts they had from other cases together.",

                "reviewText": "I'm admittedly more used to building in modern consumer desktop cases, so take this review with that in mind. Bought this case with the intention to repurpose my old gaming PC hardware with some new drives for a NAS.Pros: Size. It's pretty compact for a full size ATX case that takes a standard power supply. Drives! 8 Bays and this 5.25\" expansion slot is huuuuge. Love the existence of the SATA/SAS backplane as well Sound. It's relatively quiet and unassuming. Huge plus for a home server.Cons: Materials. The aluminum panels feel very flimsy. I would have preferred some sound dampening material. It's not loud, but it could certainly be quieter Price. I wouldn't worry much about materials if it weren't so expensive. I suppose most of the cost is in that backplane, but the $230 I spent could definitely net a much higher end feeling and looking case.",

                "reviewText": "The backplane and the drawers for the hard drives are the 2 features that justify the price of this case. Yet the backplane is excessively cheap. I ended up ripping 2 of the connectors off the back during my build.When I build my machines I usually do a rough setup where I kind of just slap everything in the case, power it on and make sure it works, then go back and reroute cables and strap things down at the end. That way I don't waste time cable managing a DOA build.The backplane uses several female SATA data ports to connect to your motherboard. It was clear that these were not the most robust mounts to begin with, but it turns out they actually have nothing physically securing them to the board. They just friction fit over the top of the delicate data pins. If you have never really looked at SATA connectors before they have small plastic notches or hooks on the male ends of the cables that ensure they are securely seated in the port. So when I went to disconnect the SATA cables from the backplane the plastic housing of the port came off with the cables, leaving the delicate data pins protruding from the backplane.Luckily I was ultimately able to reseat the port housings back over the pins where they came off. But it took an hour of stressful pin straightening to make sure they all lined up and didn't get mangled.If this board breaks Silverstone does not sell replacements as far as I can tell, and the spacing between the bays is unique to this case so 3rd party replacements will not be an option. The only recourse would be to remove the backplane and lose the hotswap convenience that is the only justification for this case.Up to now my home NAS builds have just used normal consumer desktop cases with no hotswap bays. Storage systems I have provisioned for professionally have been from enterprise OEM's. This is the first product I have purchased in this \"prosumer\" segment of the market. I am not sure if this is standard for this market segment, but from now on I will stick with either the cheaper standard consumer cases or pony up for something enterprise grade I can rely on. Either other solution will be far more robust in the end.Buyers will be lucky to get 1 working build from this case.",

Its a mid size case so cabling was a little tight, but one Big Plus with this case is the single back plane for the 8 x 3.5\" drives, meaning the drives are hot swappable and only one power cable was required. The back plane supports SAS and SATA Drives. The only negative thing I would say is the case seems a Flimsy, but it does the job at a decent price,",
