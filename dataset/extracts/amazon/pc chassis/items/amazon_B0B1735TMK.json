                "reviewText": "I just rebuilt my gaming PC with this case and also bought 12, 120mm case fans.1. Case is VERY spacious, as you can see in the photo. Hyper 212 black CPU tower with 2, 120mm fans. AMD 6700xt 3 fan GPU from XFX. Both fit just fine! 2. The back of the case has a good amount of space as well for cables. I have a non-modular PSU, the 12 case fans (2 cables ea), a hard drive, and 2 fan controllers tucked inside it.3. Tons of air flowing in this case, should have no issues keeping internals cool. With 12 of these case fans going, it can get a relatively loud wind blowing noise. I wear a headset most of the time so..4. The case is a fairly big size, I underestimated it based on pictures. I have a big desk so it's no issue for me, might be for others though.A couple things to gripe about.1. The picture on sales page is miss leading, it shows a kind of gunmetal grey front panel.. It's all black. I really wanted the gunmetal grey. But black looks great too so no worries.2. The product page also states up to 11, 120mm case fans.. It has up to 12, 120mm case fans. Luckily I bought 12 case fans. So worked out great!Overall it's a great case! I would easily recommend it.",

It has an LED switch on the top to control the light on the front. It has dust filters in every section you can imaging to keep things extra clean. Cooling should be no issue with the mesh front either. The hinge on the door is a nice touch as well.The only 2 items of feedback is the wide grill design to the power supply bottom, it makes it very visible. The second is the lack of verticle Gpu support. Otherwise it\u2019s a good case!",

                "reviewText": "Have you ever wondered what one of the top one percent performing gaming computers looks like? Well wonder no more!I bought this Vetroo case because I wanted a clean looking and cool running case that I could mount an overhead 360mm AIO water cooler (a Vetroo Lurker) in for my Republic of Gamers Z690 Maximus Hero/ Intel 13700K build. And for the price this one was perfect.With a 5.9 Ghz overclock running full time, idle temps are in the mid 20's and I never see more than low 60's in gaming, and mid 70's in the most intense benchmarking. And this is with a 3090 TI Founders Edition (you know how warm these things can run).Case comes with all the screws, standoffs, and typical hardware that quality cases have included,, along with like 5 case fans, 3 of them RGB. Excellent cable management design, and just a high quality feel to it, everything solid, the tempered glass side panel is hinged for quick access, the hinges are high quality. Plenty of room for power supply, mine is a long Corsair HX 1200, and plenty of room for even the largest GPU's out there. This is a mid tower that doesn't cramp anything.It's nice being a one percenter, lol. I highly recommend this case, the price is hella low for this level of quality... which leaves you with more money to spend on ridiculously overpriced GPU's. :-)",

Makes dusting inside the case a breeze.My only complaints are that the RBG light hub that's wired up in the back, the sticky pad that is used to hold onto the case wasn't that strong in my opinion. But it's an incredibly minor issue; I slapped on a new sticky pad and it was fine.Another thing is that the drive case in the bottom of the tower (for the HDD/SSDs to sit in), was a slight pain to remove; they didn't need it and I wanted to remove it for more cable management storage for the PSU. The paint/coating that's used on the case really held it in place - it held a couple of the screws around the case a little tightly as well. But taking it out didn't damage the coating or anything on it, was just a little more difficult that it probably should have been.But overall all the wiring worked, the case is well made, the fans all worked and they loved the color; no major complaints.",

The two installed lower fans are redundant in my opinion, and I removed these. In fact i would suggest removing them in the first instance to install a full ATX, for full to the mobo headers/ connectors. Although there is USB/C connectors for the case ports, they will not be up to the full speeds required for most users but work as expected. There are all of the screws required for build, provided in a bag, in the case. The case is made of a relatively thin alloy and when screwing in fans, etc. be careful not to overtighten as this could deform the screw holes. The layout is decent and ATX mobo and power supply went in easily enough. There is no PWM direct management for any of the supplied fans, although white 120mm fan replacements do not look out of place. The general space to accommodate various cooling options such as top mounted 360 aio coolers is more than adequate although a decent fan cooler will fit perfectly as well. The airflow through the unit appears fine on temperature testing although I did replace all of the fans for the aforementioned reasons. Power supply is good although easier to remove the disk tray that has a thumbscrew fitting, for easier cable management (replace after cabling if required).Overall, when finished, looks very nice and not out of place for a decent build.",
