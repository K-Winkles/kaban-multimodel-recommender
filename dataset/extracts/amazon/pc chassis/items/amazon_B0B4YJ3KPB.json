                "reviewText": "This model, Zalman Z10 ATX, has No Fan adapter that connect to the motherboard's system fan headers nor an adapter that connect straight to the Power Supply.All fans have Molex connectors therefore you will need an adapter to connect to the motherboard to control the Pulse Width Modulated(PWM) Fans. I connected them straight to my MSI modular power supply with their provided adapter which will mean all Fans will be running 100% all the time.Materials, design and workmanship are good that's why I'm giving them 4 stars and I'm being generous. I could have given them 3 because the price at $100, I think is high. If you have to look for an adapter, that will probably cost you $10 to $20. So this case should be prized at around $80.",

I purchased the Z10 Duo and was pleased to see it came with both a mesh front panel or tempered glass. The case size is perfect for my needs, has good cable management features, and I really appreciate the opening near the bottom to showcase the PSU. The included case fans are of mid-tier quality. No complaints, however, because at this price point, this case and all included items are a really good deal.As others have mentioned, the documentation and setup instructions are lacking. I would encourage this company to improve its documentation for future buyers of this PC case.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "So much to like about this case, but it does have one huge flaw. Starting with that flaw.. the fans are all molex. Shame shame Zalman. I've used Zalman CPU coolers for well over 20 years now, some of their models are legendary and still great even 20 years later, so I had high expectations from Zalman when it comes to supplying decent fans for their cases. Molex shortcoming aside, what you get is 3 140mm fans in the front, and 1 120mm fan in the rear, all 4 of these fan are 5v 3 pin addressable RGB. It comes with a 6 port controller in the back that does some basic RGB patterns but is somewhat limited. It can be integrated with motherboard RGB. Getting back to the fans, Zalman advertises this as being able to hold 11 fans.. I was able to actually fit in 12. There are 3 extra screw holes towards the front bottom that will fit another 120mm quite nicely. Getting the 360 AIO mounted up on top was no trouble at all, even more, I was really impressed by the amount of clearance between the AIO and the motherboard. Typically this can be a problem area for builders when squeezing in an AIO, but on this case there is more than enough height clearance. I also like how the removeable PCI brackets are all open space so that swapping in a vertical mount bracket would be no trouble at all. Power supply can be mounted fan side up or down. The top I/O panel is perfect. 2 USB 3.0 and 1 USB-C. No USB 2.0 at all. I like that and wish more cases were done this way. I also like how the RGB button is placed far apart from the power and reset buttons which helps avoid accidental presses. This case also has a PSU window which I was able to mount an RGB strip into and vinyl wrap my PSU with a hologram wrap for a really cool effect. Did I forget to mention the front filter that easily slides out for cleaning?? This case is kind of a huge case and the price is a bit up there, but wow you get so much. I'm disappointed that the provided fans were molex, considering Zalman's reputation for cooling solutions procede's them.. but all in all, I am absolutely giving this case a 5 star review. Fan's ain't too much of a deal breaker for me since I typically will change fans out on most any case I buy, and these ones actually ran pretty quiet. I ran them on my decibel meter and recorded only 49.7dB peak.. I can live with that.",

                "reviewText": "One concern is the included ZA1425BSL fans are labeled as sleeve bearing, while the manual (and their website) says they should be hydro bearing (pic). Obviously not a problem if you\u2019re swapping them out anyways, but if you\u2019re keeping them, it\u2019d be something to check on and maybe contact support on.Otherwise, it\u2019s a case with decent features and build quality, especially for the current listing price.Going over a few things not pointed out in the current listing:- There\u2019s about 2cm of space on the back side, so plenty of space for cabling.- The panel between the lower power supply space and the main space is like 80+% vented (pic), so thermally it\u2019s not doing much (at least without additional fans).- The 3.5\u201d HDD tray is plastic, but the frame it slides into is metal (pic), and you can mount an additional 3.5\u201d or 2.5\u201d drive on it..- Side panel dust screen is on the inside by default, so you\u2019d need to take off the side panel to remove and clean the filter. Since it\u2019s just magnetic, it\u2019s easy to mount it externally, with the only downside being it\u2019s not flush (pic).- Dust filter for the power supply slides out (pic) without having to remove/unscrew anything elseI\u2019m still waiting on other parts of my build, so can\u2019t yet comment on how things fit.",
