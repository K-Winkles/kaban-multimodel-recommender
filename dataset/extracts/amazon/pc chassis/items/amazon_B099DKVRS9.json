                "reviewText": "If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. This case is beautiful and I actually think its more efficient than the Lian Li. There is LOTS of space for all your hardware and fans. There is lots of space on the back end to house your cables. I really liked the black, plastic cable filters. It makes the appearance look nice when you have hundreds of cables from the back and nicely organized in the front. RGB lighting on the front of case is beautiful. It even has a metal barrier blocking the RGB strip so you don't accidentally knock it or break it. If I HAD to find something negative to write it would be that there is only 1 dust filter. Granted, the one that came with it is magnetic and is super convenient; however I wish it came with more to cover all of the openings in the case. There is a small hole for the PSU connection to the top of the motherboard that I wish was a little bigger but with some planning ahead you can make it work.Pros:1. Nice design and sturdy materials2. LOTS of space. Space shouldnt be an issue with this case at all3. Lots of air flow. Case has lots of space for fans and holes to let them breathe4. Black, plastic cable filters help the front look more organized while you house thousands of cables on the back5. Sturdy, yet relatively light.Cons:1. Lots of openings in the case to breathe, but only one dust filter (Looking into buying more dust filters)2. Not necessarily a con, but you may need to plan your build ahead as some screws can only be reached with clearance. For example, you cant adjust the top fans if you install the Mobo first. This is typical for most cases but figured I'd put it to help someone reading this.All in all very nice case. I freaking love this thing. If you're on edge about getting it, you should send it. It looks great, has great cable management and space, and also has lots of room to breathe.P.S. Seller must have lived right down the road as the shipping was estimated to be 4-5 days and it came in less than 24 hours. Great product and service from the seller!",

                "reviewText": "I really like this case. I've built several PCs, using many cases and I like this one a lot. It was finally discounted to an more doable price and I grabbed it up, glad I did. Lots to like about it. Its Clean. Sturdy. Fairly easy to work with. Was packed well. Plenty of room in the back and front. Its not Branded with a logo or anything. I love the simple futuristic design on the front glass for the case RGB(Youll need a molex for it) For ME, this was a fairly simple case to work with so long a you just take a second to plan it. Looks pretty on or off. I got the Black case. I would most certainly recommend this *So long as it's priced appropriately ( 90.00-130.00)My only very minor complaint was the stand offs for the Motherboard were a bit of a pain to screw in, but nothing bad. That's itPros:-Easy to work with (I've built many PCs, so im not a novice, I feel most can build in this with out much issue, Maybe lol)-Plenty of room-Clean design-No Company logos or anything. Just the case. I dont want \"GIM\" or other corporate nonsense case, at least in visable areas. I just want a clean case. Got it here.-Packed well-Looks beautiful on or off. (Least mine does )-Very hard to find any complaints with this. Well Done GIM!!!! Standing Ovation imho.Cons:-Stand offs for Mobo bit tricky to get going-My cats like it too muchProof, you do not need to break the bank to get a good case.Proof you do not need to get carried away with gimmicky case designs.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very attractive case. I like that it includes some built in RGB lights in the front of the case and that there is no pillar between the glass plates.The metal grate over the top of the case seems sturdy enough to hold a normal housecat without crushing it into your fans or radiator. The magnetic filter on top of that does not stay in place if a cat decides to walk on it and there is no other method provided to hold it in place. The power switch on top of the computer is quite sensitive and will activate if barely brushed by the paw of a housecat.The side glass plate installs onto some rubber bushings and then screws are attached to hold it in place. The front glass plate does not have rubber bushings; it is held in place between a screw and a sheet of metal. It seems odd that they would do one glass plate so well and the glass plate right next to it so much worse. The thumbscrews provided for both plates hold them in place very well.I put a 240mm radiator (2 fans) in the top of the case and there isn't space next to that for another fan in the top so there'll only be a max of nine fans in my case.The space for cable management behind the motherboard keeps it looking nice but it also makes it a bit of a pain if you don't install everything in the proper order. For example, there's an opening at the bottom of the case next to the motherboard where you might feed thru USB and audio connections, or a fan power connection, and if you don't do all of that before installing the power supply then you'll have to uninstall the power supply to get back there.The case is almost always shown with a radiator installed in the top of the case. There is an opening for running the CPU power cables but there is little room between the radiator fan and the CPU power cables; the way I have them in there it is probably less than a millimeter. If the cables behind get jostled then I need to press those CPU power cables down again so they don't interfere with the fan.The case doesn't come with a manual. Installation of most things seems standard but when I got to the installation of hard drives that was a little different than I'm used to I ended up just guessing how it went together. The result seemed like it might be correct but having to guess at things doesn't make for a fantastic experience.The hard drives install onto a bar over the back of the case. That bar could theoretically be removed in order to allow easier access to the rest of the case but the screws that hold it in place did not seem to be the type that one would normally remove and again there was not even a very basic manual so I didn't know if I should. Working around the bar was quite difficult and it becomes even more so after the hard drives are installed.The hard drives are installed via screws thru rubber grommets which probably help silence any vibrations. Since they are installed with screws they are not quickly swappable. If you have a screwdriver they are not terribly hard to install or uninstall. The rubber grommets can be easily lost when they fall out and bounce away.",
