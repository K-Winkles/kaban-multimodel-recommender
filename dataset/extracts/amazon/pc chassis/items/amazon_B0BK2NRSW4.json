                "reviewText": "Originally purchased the 3.5 inch screen to test it out. Everything worked and decided to upgrade to the 5 inch screen (it's only like $20 more). The software is better on the 5 inch - would definitely recommend the 5 inch screen.Additional info:I purchased the 3.5 inch screen. Install is easy - literally plug and play, and download software. You can use a USB A to type C cord (included) to plug into one of the exterior USB ports on your computer, or they include a motherboard USB cable, that has an adapter to change to USB C. I used the motherboard cable, you will need some USB power slots available on the MB for this option. Go to the website and download the software - software boots up automatically with the computer, and works just as intended.There are about 40-50 pre-set templates that you can use to display information. They have various info, with temps, % usage, internet speed, etc. Some of them even have weather function if you put in your city. (seems to be stuck in Celsius). There are a lot of nice pre-sets. I was just looking for % usage and temp of the CPU and GPU, and there's 5-10 preset that nicely show that info. With most of the templates, you can upload your own background photo to change the background.The 5 inch screen was better in almost every way. Besides being a larger screen, it included a mounting bracket thing. The screen isn't very heavy, so I used some 3M double sided tape to mount. The software is better on the 5 inch. It just seems farther along - more updated. It can auto detect CPU and GPU name - you don't have to manually enter. The templates also support videos, so a video can play behind the info. Software is easier to use. When I put my computer to sleep, the screen also goes to sleep on the 5 inch. The 3.5 inch did not, it would stay on in a frozen state until I logged in again.Overall very pleased. Very nice little screen and works with not too much trouble. Lots of customizability. If you plan to use the editor, it seems somewhat straight-forward, it has pre-defined presets, and you insert them to where you want, and then upload your own images, etc. I Imagine to get a good looking template it would take 1-2 hours to figure it all out. For me, it was easier to just use the pre-set ones and change the background if needed.",

Product box arrived with the 5\" Display monitor, stand (which does not seem to fit the display monitor), a mini USB cable and that is all. No instructions, no software. No links to download software. The display comes on showing the product name AX206 LCD for AIDA64 Business with an orange skull on a black background and that is where it stays. I googled AIDA64 Business Software for download and it takes me to a webpage where you have to buy the software. There is a 30 day free trial which is supposed to be send to your email after you give them your email address name etc. I am still waiting for the email so I can click on the software link.

Used a small strip of industrial 3M to keep it in place and it came with a 180 degree behind the case back usb connection for a perfectly clean look.

The software that comes with it will fail and you'll have to do a lot to get something working.It looks good, brightness is great. Temps are accurate. After about two months the software for it stops working. It gives an error about hardware or something. Luckily there is free Python based software that actually works better. I'd give a link but Amazon doesn't like that. So, just search for software dev's name \"Matthieu Houdebine\". Should take you right to it. Fair warning it takes some command-line stuff to get it going. You have to install Python 3.11 (from the Python's website not Windows Store) and then install some addons. Getting it to launch with windows requires some tricky work in windows Event Scheduler. Instructions for that are on the page with the with the app. Good luck.",

But this screen has connections on the side which is not ideal for internal case installations. This could have been easily remedied with a couple of 90 degrees connectors that should have been included in the package. Also it has a clunky power switch that you have to manually turn on and off. When you power off your PC the screen stays powered on if you have power management setting to allow power to your USB while system is shut down. Overall build is OK but this is not worth the price. I would just get the rasberry pi setup and spen a few more bucks on 90 degrees connection wiring. I am definitely returning this item.Also this did not come with any instructions nor did it have any templates. I had to build my own so a couple of templates would have been nice. Overall look is good because it's encased but there are definitely some things that could have been improved.",

I have to turn off and on the PC multiple times before it finally gets recognized. I can use the cable provided on multiple USB headers and same result. I have also used my own USB cable into a USB port, and same issue. These reviews, sadly didn\u2019t exist when I bought it but now they do, so buy something else from a more reputable seller or brand who will actually support its products or customers.Simply do not buy, it has went from working once in a while to never. This product is pure trash.",
