                "reviewText": "The aesthetic is outstanding and unique for ITX cases. A completed PC is very difficult to work on after it is built and you are certain to strip a screw if you access the insides more than twice.M3 self tapping screws are better than stock are more difficult to strip out. Also using Phillips heads improves serviceability.A fan cover should be included at this price point, the one pictured is a couple of cents in bulk and matches the chrome handles.If you do a lot of cable management (required for this case) there's lots of space inside for a large CPU cooler, 2x 2.5\" SATA drives, and even a 3.5\" HDD if you wanted to squeeze one in above the PSU.GPU options are *very* limited, even a short single fan 3060 doesn't fit due to thickness without modding the stock GPU cooler.This case is recommended if you enjoy a challenging build with a sleek, unconventional look in the end.",

                "reviewText": "This case is pretty nice overall, with just a few qualms. Check VERY carefully to make sure that your graphics card will fit. Mine is super tiny and it still didn\u2019t fit, sadly :( there\u2019s also no screw hole for graphics card stability on the back which is super important and is standard with every other case.Another weird quirk is that it actually doesn\u2019t come with a case fan, just a hole for one. I knew this going in, but that hole being smaller than 120mm means that you can\u2019t mount any standard AIO water coolers, either. there is a hard drive mount but they don\u2019t point it out in any of the support or help materials, which is weird.Overall, it\u2019s a really unique case. The layout is kinda\u2026 bad, to be honest. There\u2019s a whole lot of empty space in the middle where your CPU cooler can go, which could have definitely been shuffled around to offer more space for the GPU or more hard drives instead. It\u2019s small, but there are much smaller cases that actually support reasonably-sized graphics cards.It\u2019s also missing a bracket to add stability between the top and back panels which when combined with the lack of GPU-stabilizing screw leads to a surprisingly wobbly case.I\u2019d only really recommend this case if you\u2019re in love with the aesthetic and are willing to take the sacrifice on it not really fitting modern good graphics cards and also don\u2019t care about having a lot of non-nvme storage. I hope that they release a newer version at some point that fixes these issues. This case could be smaller while offering much broader hardware support while still looking extremely cool.",
