There\u2019s plenty of room for a liquid cooler on top, just don\u2019t go bigger than a 240mm radiator. The cable management was pretty easy as well thanks to the cable straps and zip ties. And the case is well designed to hide all the cables from the front. Airflow works great as well (hence the name) with 3 fans pulling in front, and the radiator on top and a fan in the back, case maxes out at six fans which is plenty. I would get different fans, but the 2 stock ones it comes with aren\u2019t the worst. It\u2019s a very sturdy good quality case, and it\u2019s pretty easy to clean out the dust filters. I would not use the vertical gpu mounting option as it is much too close to the front glass panel to allow airflow. 10/10 the only thing I would change is the ssd trays on the back. They are super hard to get out, I had to use a vice grip to hold the thumbscrew and yank it out. If you don\u2019t want them on take them off before you put anything in the case.",

                "reviewText": "Nothing but good to say about this case. Aesthetically it's very nice and build wise it's amazing. It has dark tinted glass so you can barely see in when everything's off but once the LEDs inside light up it looks amazing without blinding you with bright lights. It has great cable management and amazing cooling. The whole front is metal and pops on and off really easily, no cheap plastic clips that break. The front dust filter is magnetic and very easy to remove and clean, the top dust filter has a nice pull tab to take it off and the bottom dust filter for the Power Supply simply slides in and out of place for cleaning. The GPU slots are inset to the case to make more room for cables so they don't stick so far out the back of the case and each individual GPU slot it's attached by screw instead of break off tabs. The case is pretty roomy inside fitting my Thermalright Peerless assassin 120 CPU cooler and my 3 fan XFX 6800XT. The power button has a very nice feel and the front IO panel includes a USB, Type-C, Headphones jack and reset button. Overall this case was very easy to build in and I recommend this case to anyone looking for a quality built case with good airflow and compatibility",

                "reviewText": "Good: Just about everything. This is my first PC build in a few years, and it was pleasing to see that the state of the art has advanced quite a bit. The case is attractive without being garish, lightweight despite the glass panel but solid. Edges are deburred and painted, although there were a couple of rough spots in hidden places which, of course, I immediately found digitally while checking things out. The side panels are ridiculously easy to remove; two fasteners, tip the panel out and slide off. USB ports and controls on the top edge of the case. Two drive bays, which can probably accommodate four SSDs, set crosswise in the case because why not, I guess. I was briefly taken aback that there are no bays accessible at the front panel, but on reflection there's no real need for that nowadays. In their place, the entire front panel can be stuffed with fans if desired. There is certainly no lack of ventilation, large grilles in front, rear, and top (the top is covered with a nifty removable pet-fur and fluff filter,) and you can mount fans in all of them. It comes with one fan each in front and rear. The layout in general is logical and builder-friendly, cables almost route themselves. Comes with a handful of zip ties and a good assortment of fasteners. Very good price for what you get.Bad: The supplied fans are a bit buzzy at full speed. I'm planning to add fans anyway so I might as well replace them. I'm also not a big fan (ha) of the glass side panel, even though that seems to be the style now. I'm not going RGB-happy and turning my rig into a scale-model rave club, so would have preferred an option to get this box with a regular steel panel.Ugly: The shipping box appears to have been dropped rather hard on one corner. It was well-packed, so no visible harm done.Bottom line: Considering that it isn't difficult to lay out $150 or more for a case nowadays, this is a great value. You get everything you need in an attractive, well-engineered package. If they'd used some Noctua fans to keep things quiet when the CPU/GPU get busy, it would be just about perfect. As is, I'm very happy with it. Five stars.",

                "reviewText": "I had a prebuilt I bought a long time ago that I basically have upgraded into a new PC over the years. The only thing I haven't replaced is the case by this point. My old case wasn't awful, but it began to fall apart, and I always wanted a white PC case so I decided to give in and get this one! I don't regret it at all so far. It was really easy to set up, and the cable management is way better than other cases I have worked with (I have worked on a few PC's for my brother and friends as well). I also love how this case is a mid sized tower, but somehow has so much room? I found it much easier to work with compared to my old case, which was a large sized tower. Everything is really easy to remove and put back together, and it came with extra zip ties, velcro strips, and screws for fans and screwing in the motherboard, which is super nice. The only thing that I noticed was it doesn't fit a 140mm fan at the back of the case, which is what I had in my old case (this is user error, I didn't double check this. Just wanted to mention in case anyone might be unaware too). But the case came with two simple black 120 mm fans so I just used one of those no problem. It looks great and I am super happy with it!",

                "reviewText": "Coming from 4000X RGB & 5000D Airflow, this is a great addition to the larger Airflow models. Best for budget builds where you want same looks/space/cooling without all the fancy features.Easily fits standard top mounted 240 rad on ATX board with very tall RAM. Front fans can mount from outside case if using 360 rad or long graphics card. For the price, doesn't include: rubber grommets, SSD trays or cable channel. Not an issue as black case hides everything well & lots of space to cable manage. Compared to 4000/5000D Airflow, case looks much smaller with nearly same interior size if that makes sense. No front panel USB-C port is great as most B450/B550 boards usually don't have USB-C header anyhow. Perfect case for budget builds using 240/360 AIO & long GPU's.",
