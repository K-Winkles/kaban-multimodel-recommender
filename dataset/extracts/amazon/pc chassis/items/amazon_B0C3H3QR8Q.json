However, to my surprise, this thing is comparatively tiny. There isn't a ton of space to cable manage and it definitely takes some experience and patience but this is definitely the best bang for your buck mATX case out there. Airflow is better than my big ATX case and the glass panel door is such a great addition. It's small but can fit a full 160mm CPU cooler.Sidenote: I could not control the ARGB fans with my gigabyte motherboard because mine does not have a place to plug in the included VDG header.",

I had to remove the drive bay to fit my power supply in, but putting it back in isn\u2019t bad. It looks good. I will say the fact that the fans are molex connected instead of fan connections is a bit odd but the case is cheap enough that this is not too much of an issue.",

Comes with simple instructions. My only disappointment was that it has no accomodations for a DVD/Blu-Ray drive, but, then, again , this is 2022, right? Optical drives are not used much anymore, but can be added externally. Overall, recommended.",
