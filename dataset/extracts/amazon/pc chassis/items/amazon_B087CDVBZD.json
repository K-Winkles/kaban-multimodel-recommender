                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Tough to beat at this price point, a very good mATX mini tower.",
                "reviewText": "This is a great budget mATX case. The internal layout is good, with a removable 3.5\" drive cage, dedicated mounts for two 2.5\" SSDs, decent cable management options and the ability to mount up to five 120mm cooling fans. The cabling for the front audio and USB ports are sleeved and have plenty of length to reach the far opposite corner of any mATX motherboard. The build quality is very good, although not perfect, no major complaints considering the price. The side panels could use ever so slightly thicker gauge steel and the 3.5 drive cage is a bit flimsy as well, but everything is perfectly functional. The front bezel is filtered from top to bottom and easily snaps out without any interference with the power button or front USB ports, making it easy to take outside and blow clean if any dust collects on the filter. The bottom vent for the PSU also has a removable filter, a nice touch for a case in this price range. I also really like the looks of the case as well... clean and simple but not boring... doesn't look like an alien cyborg egg that fell off a spaceship.I used this case for a budget gaming PC for the son of a friend, so it didn't have a ton of super high powered components. I added a 120mm fan to the front face, to add some positive air pressure to the case and to keep dust intake at the front panel where the filter will grab it. Using only the supplied rear exhaust fan might lead to dust being sucked in from gaps in the bottom and the vents on top. As far as GPU, my build used a smaller 1050ti but I believe this case would easily accept any dual-fan GPU. If you aren't using any 3.5\" drives, the cage can be removed to offer more room for cables / airflow. I left the cage installed in my build, using it as essentially a storage shed for the extra cables from the non-modular PSU. That said, the internal area seems roomy for mini tower and I never felt cramped working in the space.For a mATX PC on a tight budget, you can do a whole lot worse than this case. I would easily recommend it. Thermaltake always seems to deliver on these inexpensive cases that aren't \"cheap\". Great features and very good quality for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I transferred all of my parts out of my CM HAF 912 to this and I haven't looked back, ever. This case provides a mostly simple and clean building experience.Installation: To start, the installation of my power supply was as expected. The holes lined up perfectly and I did not need to do any custom modding. A nice surprise for this price point. I have heard stories though of others not having a similar experience. Installation of the motherboard was also not bad and proved to have no issues. While installing the GPU, I noticed that this case didn't provide reusable brackets for PCIe slots. Not a big deal for me as I won't be adding anything but you should take this into consideration as it will leave your case a little \"open\" if you take something out. Onto the drives. I used an SSD and a HDD in my build so your milleage may vary. I connected my HDD in the top of the HDD cage using the provided tool-less brackets and found no issues. I then screwed my SSD into the top of the cage and had to squeeze my SATA and power cables around the back of the case as there are no cut-outs designed for this installation methods to look pretty. I would recommend mounting SSDs sideways above the HDD cage. My Hyper 212 Evo fitted perfectly in the case only because of the extrusions on each side panel.Cable Management: I initially thought this was going to be the debut of troubles but actually wasn't! Cable management was rather easy although I have a couple of notes and desires. For one, the CPU power cable doesn't have a lot of room to route through the top left side of the case. Secondly, there are no cut outs below the motherboard area so you will find yourself routing cables all the way over to the main cutout area. As for my third comment, there aren't any rubber garments. Yes, I know this isn't to be expected. I'm just noting this. So in all, cable management is going to be easy enough for any novice to make a clean build but I think may leave first-time builders a little lost.Other Notes: The included case fan comes with a sleeved cable which is pretty awesome for this price point. It is installed in the back of the case however, and should be moved to the front in most situations. This is to provide positive air flow if you are not using any other fans. Positive air flow encourages all the air to go through the front intake, which is filtered. This prevents a lot of dust intake through nooks and crannies. The front I/O is very nice and it is a pleasant surprise to find USB 3.0 in a case at this price point. The included thumbscrews are very nice and are on both side panels.Overall, this case is an excellent pick for someone building MATX on a budget and should not be overlooked. I was very pleasantly surprise by all of the subtle features in this case that I noticed when I built in it. I would definitely recommend this. A-.",

Unfortunately the 3 included fans are wired for use with the included argb controller, and do not connect directly to the motherboard, so they cannot be speed controlled and they are very slow, almost feel like they move nothing at all. If your gonna want good case airflow or individual argb lighting control, buy something else.",

No, it's not up to par with very high-end cases, but again, at this price point, it's really quite good. Everything is well laid out and cable management is a breeze. There's lots of options for fans and radiators, including a spot for a 200mm fan at the top of the case. The only negative is the lack of really effective dust filtering for the front-mounted fans.",
