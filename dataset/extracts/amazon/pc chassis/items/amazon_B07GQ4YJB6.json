                "reviewText": "I have not built a PC since 2011. Case design has come a long way since then. I was a little wary of buying a case without any reviews or reviews on the internet, but I trust Computer Upgrade Kings. I have bought 3 laptops from them in the last few years, so I trusted that they knew what they were doing.It has about an inch of room behind the tray and plenty of anchor points for cable management. The back panel comes off with two thumbscrews. The tempered glass panel looks amazing; It secures with 4 flat thumbscrews, which look good; don't lose them. I left the plastic protection on the glass until the last minute to avoid dirt and fingerprints. The case has cutouts at all appropriate spots. Now, on to the items that are not so obvious.You can see from the photos that the air can flow in to the fans from the grills. What was not obvious is that the grill does continue all around each panel. I didn't know if it would be solid on one side, but it's not. This helps with airflow.The PSU shroud has a grill above and below the PSU, but the one of the bottom has a mesh filter. So, mount your PSU with the fan facing down, as usual.The hard drive cage, which I didn't need (and would have liked to use the space for cables), is not removable without taking apart the entire case. I could get it loose by removing 5 screws but it's trapped inside the PSU shroud, and I didn't want to disassemble the shroud.The case does come with 6 fans, pre-installed. The green light is in a wide ring outside of the spin of the fans themselves. They are 3 pin fans, not PWM. Still, to get 6 lighted fans and fabricated front and top around a good case design, is a good value at this price-point.I have water-cooled CPU and GPU, so I'm now familiar with the positioning of the fans. There are plenty of screws for them. The plastic top and front pop off with a very firm pull. This is necessary if you have any radiator that you want to attach to the top or front.The top fans reside inside of a cage, so if your radiator is slightly wider than a fan, like mine, it will not fit up into that cage. Since there was only top motherboard clearance below the fans for a radiator, and I didn't want to attach it as a pull-only, I attached it to the front.In the photos you can see the green trim everywhere and it does look good. It's the color of the plastic except for the vertical line running down the center of the front panel, which is a green light strip. That's the only one I plugged into the PSU directly.Note: I attached the fans to the motherboard in pairs. I say pair because fans are typically 0.5 amp and motherboard headers are typically 1 amp, so each can support 2. I chained the molex and then attached the 3-pin to the motherboard. One header on my motherboard did not light up the fans but the others did.The case's front-panel connections are the standard ones (pwr, hdd, etc.) plus a usb 2, usb 3, and led. I don't have a header for the led. All of the cables are plenty long enough.Finally, there are 6 pre-installed motherboard standoffs and 3 more included.So, I like the look of the case, was able to cable manage effectively, and it looks awesome. I'm happy with it.",

Colors are great, glass is amazing and easier to screw. No dvd tray access. It's worth 150 compared to other smaller brands anyways. I would recommend even if it gets a little warm",

                "reviewText": "The first thing I noticed when I removed this from the box was how light it was. I've held cases from similar price ranges that felt significantly heavier and sturdier. The front of the case has two plastic panels that angle towards each other leaving a vertical gap to let the light from the fans though. That is kinda cool. But the panels seem to be made of cheap plastic and also seem as if they could be broken off if even slightly mishandled.The absolute worst feature was on there inside and on the bottom where, inexplicably the designer decided it would be a great idea to insert a metal shell that must've been 6 inches in height, if not more -- thus drastically cutting space from the rest of the interior. This shell extended all the way from front to back and was intentionally attached so as not to be removed. Pure insanity. The only apparently thing you could do with the shelled area was store the power supply inside. The power cords from the power supply have to be slotted through a laughably and infuriatingly narrow slot at the bottom which only further served to clutter the interior.... you know, that place where'd you'd like to have room for a motherboard and all the goodies that attach to it.... Did I mention that there didn't seem to be any obvious way to get the power supply into the pointless shelled in area, so I ended up having to damage the shell after giving up trying to figure out if there was something I was missing or maybe even a spell incantation to recite.By the time I was beginning to insert the motherboard and other items I was already second guessing the idea of going any further with a case that cost me over $100. I felt like if I didn't take this piece of garbage back I'd be letting them get away with charging me a hundred bucks for a case that's frankly WORTHLESS in my opinion. I wouldn't be surprised if the green fans all started dying off after a couple months at most.Unless they lower the price of this case to $5 and would be using it to build a cheap starter computer for your kid's AVOID THIS PIECE OF JUNK LIKE YOU WOULD A SWARM OF MOSQUITOES FLYING STRAIGHT YOUR WAY.",
