                "reviewText": "Update: 11-26-23My build is complete, I figured that if my case looks like a fish tank, why not add some fish : )This is simply the best case I have ever had, and will be my show case for some time. I'm so glad that Lian Li did not tint the glass on this case. Being that the glass is clear, lets the lights colors glow off the glass giving it even more class. If your even thinking of building in this case \"and you have the desk space\" then don't even hesitate. It is fully worth the money.This was such a \"huge\" upgrade to my Corsair 680X. In fact, it made that case look kinda small in comparison. I have built my own custom desk and it's sole design is to show off my build. But the Corsair simply did not have the space to show anything. It was a fairly large case but was very small in the actual build area. The Lian Li O11 Dynamic EVO XL is simply in a league of it's own. It was a dream to build in and met all the requirements that I needed to replicate my old build, but in something that would actually show it off (compare to my old build pic). There was plenty of room for wire management and even gave me space for my hard drive switch. The build quality is top notch. If I had any complaint at all, it would be that the blanks that they use in the card slots do not stay tight when other cards are in the same locking tab. The blanks are thinner, and feel cheap compared to other brands I have built in, and thus require some sticky tape to keep them from vibrating around. It's a small gripe, but if you have a sub woofer close to your tower, they will vibrate and make noise, and since they are specifically designed for this case, you can't use other blanks to replace them.All in all, this will be the last case I build in for some time. It is my third, and every time I built in one of the older cases, it just didn't feel right. This case is a work of art and will fill the bill for some time.Oh, one other small incidental issue is that due to the design of where the ssd's mount and how they mount, you cannot use a 90 degree sata on your hard drive. The ssd's mount the wrong direction and you cannot hook the sata cable up to them. I ended up just double sticking my drive backwards to the same area since it's the only black sata cable I had. Not a huge issue, just something to note.",

It could easily fit the largest GPUS and it would fit a custom waterloop if that is your thing. The Case looks great. The only complaint is that it does not come with any fans and some of he accessories from Lian-li are expensive.",

Everything is staying really cool, great airflow. Cable management is well thought out and the mounting of the PSU in the middle (not bottom) of the case ensures that all cables reach. I also love the hot swapable HD cages (which are removeable) and the adjustable motherboard mount.",

                "reviewText": "I can\u2019t say enough about this case. I did go for the white because I wanted something other than all black, which is what I had previously in a Thermaltake case.Pros:-The case is extremely modular. They have thoroughly thought through every little possible detail to make it easy for the user. There\u2019s is even a way to make it a left-side case if that suits your needs.-There is so much room to put monstrous cards in. I have the 7900 XTX and it is pretty large. As you can see in the picture, I probably have about 4 more inches of room.-The airflow, holy crap. I don\u2019t even have all the fans I want in it and the airflow is still amazing. During gaming, my case temps have gone down substantially.- There\u2019s room for so many fans. I currently have 8 total, including the AIO fans. If you really wanted to, you could have a total of thirteen 120mm fans.-The led and color of the case is just the icing on the cake. I\u2019m so glad I went with white.-The I/O ports on the front side can be moved, which is a huge plus.Cons:-There really isn\u2019t many cons to this case besides the cable management, as others have said. I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal but a little more room to cable manage would have been great. This doesn\u2019t knock the overall score of this case.If you are looking to upgrade your case, get this one. It\u2019s so much value for the money. They have ways to add on extra parts as well. Great case by Lian Li!",

I needed something bigger since I upgraded to a 4080 GPU, this case fits it and has plenty of room left over, provides for great cable management and temperatures. The best feature for me is that its modular, I needed an inverted glass panel for my components to be visible and have the glass on the right side (most glass cases come with glass on left).I\u2019d recommend this case for anyone who have large GPU and wants great cable management/temps.10/10",

The XL is larger than I imagined basically needing a table of its own to sit on haha. It's beautiful, it was easy to install new parts in and easy to transfer the old parts from a previous build. It took me awhile as a first timer but everything is easy to use, has plenty of space and room for cable management and it's worth the buy. I added my old case compared to the new one, definitely an upgrade.",
