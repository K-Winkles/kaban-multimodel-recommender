This case Is as good, if not better, than cases I have paid much more for. The tempered glass is really high-end glass. The case is really solid. The only thing to complain about, is it comes with zero instructions. You can find a downloadable manual online however. Not that is all that much of a help. This company makes a superb case, at a unbelievable price. They however, have taken the green move to heart, and save a lot of trees, with their zero manuals.",

There is no issue with cable management. There is plenty of room to install most extra coolers or graphic card and other add on devices. There is 2 RGB lights system one for the plug holes in the front panel and one for the strip. If your mother board does not support RGB you need to connect the RGB system to your PSU for the LEDs in the front panel to light up.",

This is pretty big for a mid-tower.Some of the other reviewers mentioned a dearth of stand-offs, but I found there to be plenty if you reused some of the pre-installed ones.The case I received had two pre-installed, non-lit fans (one front & one rear,) rather than a single RGB fan.The description mentioned the need for an ARGB motherboard, or an ARGB controller, for the front panel LED strip, but it turns out that all the front panel RGB effects have their own built-in controller: you only need an ARGB motherboard if you want to sync the front panel strip to the motherboard lighting. The RGB on the plugs & switches don't have a sync. connector. The case lighting has multiple options, as well as off.There are two removable drive trays that will hold either a 2\u00bd\" or 3\u00bd\" drive, and two more places to hard mount additional 2\u00bd\" HDD/SSDs. There's no provision for an optical drive.",

                "reviewText": "My 2 main computers are a 3rd gen i7 (HP 8300) and a 6th gen i7 (Hp 800 G2), both with 32 gigs of RAM. I had a GTX 1060 in the 800 because my GTX 1070 wouldn't fit in the case and the Argus M1 solved this problem. Other than Minecraft (running 65 mods), both PCs do everything I need. I'm a casual gamer, so I don't need a high end gaming PC. I've been a Windows Insider since 2015 and Microsoft recently upgraded both to Windows 11, so now I'm planning to order a second case for the 8300 since both machines are good for another 10 or more years.I was pleasantly surprised with how solid the Argus M1 case is. For $50, I was expecting it to be about as sturdy as some extra heavy duty aluminum foil. I was equally surprised that it came with 2-120mm fans. Neither are illuminated, and neither have great air flow, but are still useful. Assembly took no more than 20 minutes (if that). I would highly recommend this case, and not just for a budget build.",

Highly recommended - it also came with storage cables and a bunch of screws. I have attached a photo to show you it being powered!",
