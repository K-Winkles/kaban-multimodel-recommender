                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. One of the standout features of the Corsair 5000D is its exceptional airflow design. The front panel features a large mesh surface that allows for unrestricted airflow, keeping my components cool even during intensive gaming sessions. With ample room for additional fans or liquid cooling options, this case excels in thermal performance.The black variant of this case exudes elegance and sophistication. The tempered glass side panel showcases the internal components beautifully, allowing for a clean and organized build. The cable management system is well thought out, keeping the interior clutter-free and enhancing the overall aesthetics.The mid-tower design strikes a perfect balance between size and versatility. It offers ample space for high-end components, including large graphics cards and multiple storage drives. I appreciate the tool-free drive installation, which makes setup a breeze. Additionally, the modular design of the case allows for customization and reconfiguration to suit different build requirements.Corsair has clearly put thought into the assembly process. The case comes with clear and concise instructions, making it easy for both beginners and experienced builders. The well-placed cable routing holes and ample space behind the motherboard tray make cable management a straightforward task.Despite its impressive airflow, the Corsair 5000D also offers a degree of noise reduction. The included high-density sound-dampening material on the side panels helps to muffle internal sound, providing a quieter computing experience.Very good tower, perfect for your computer.I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Airflow is the word here. It's obviously the focus of this very capable case. If you want maximum fresh air - this is the case. Six intake fans. Four exhaust. The readings speak for themselves. I have a Ryzen 9 5900x that is supposed to stay below 90C. I have yet to see it go above 65. I have a great CPU cooler in the Noctua NH-D15 as well.That is the bottom line. You can keep reading about this build, and what I put in it and why, but you don't need that info to know this is a quality, SOLID case with many options, and lots of attention to detail. Go online and watch ANY review of this case and you can see the accolades from people who evaluate this stuff all day, every day. This is a popular case for a reason. It's a good one. You'll read below about my inexperience with this kind of case and build, yet I had no issues just putting the whole thing together intuitively.The cable management compartment is real nice. You can be neat as you want to, wires showing are wires showing. This case makes it real.easy to hide everything.The single drawback to this case? (If you 2ant to call it that...) It's HUGE. It's just.... Big as hell, and I can't find a piece of furniture made for PC cases that will fit it. It's sitting on the desk right now, while I decide how to deal with this. Make sure you want all this case. It's BIG. 20\"X20\"X9.5\".The rest of this beast is centered around an EVGA RTX 3080 FTW3 10GB, and 64GB 3600MHz, and a Samsung M.2 980 Pro Gen4. The whole package smokes. There are a couple monitors hooked to it now, and I'll buy a proper gaming monitor soon. It will also be used for VR stuff.This is my first gaming rig build. I am an audio guy. I've built many high powered PCs in the past (though it's been a couple years since I have built one for my own house, from scratch,) but nothing like this. The biggest concern I've ever had for graphics is being able to run dual monitors for recording studio software. Memory, processing power and tons of storage is the name of the game in audio PCs. The audio gear that interfaces with those is all outboard, and typically can move from one PC to an upgraded one no problem.The case made this easy. A whole bunch of modern parts I'd never used or installed wasn't an issue or hard. No crazy compromising or going without something I wanted. The case is huge and fits a LOT.This is a whole different thing. I've never built a PC with a case window, lights, or this many fans. I've never had such an insane CPU cooler, or one of these 'second cpu' Graphics Card monstrosities. And I've never had my own machine with an M.2 drive.Oh. And this isn't REALLY for me. It's for my 13 year old son. He is into animation and gaming in these (sandbox?), Minecraft / Roblox user created worlds and characters. The rig he was using was an i3 with a 4GB GPU. Worthless. He is now blown away and I can't keep him off it..I got the white case and some other white elements, like the side intake fans have white LED rings, and the MOBO has some white and silver elements. I also did one \"mod.\" (Picture/ Video) I put in two chunky, round, white led lights in the case and wired them to the power and HDD LED connections on the MOBO. It's a cool effect. There's lots of room for lights or any other stuff you want to put in for decor.",

                "reviewText": "First things first... The GOOD: This case has more than enough airflow to keep the latest Intel Chip cool. It's not too heavy even though it's a big case. The air filter screens on the front and top are a nice touch. They seem to be good quality. This case comes with two optional shrouds / guards that you can use to aid in cable management and aesthetics. Nice touch. Keeps everything tidy and neat looking. The tempered side glass panel has a nice dark tint to it. Looks great. The other side has a double side door set up. It keeps the cables snug on that side. Plenty of room for 2.5\" SSD drive mounting on the side behind motherboard. This case also has tons of room to mount a CLC cooler on the front or top. You can even mount a push-pull fan set up. The BAD: This case only came with two total fans. That probably won't cut it if you're running a semi-current processor. I had to spend additional money on a set of front fans. The power supply compartment is just a little bit small if you use a 1000 watt or higher PSU. I removed the 3.5\" internal HD cage to give more room. Might be a problem if you're planning to install 3.5\" drives. Over all this case is a 5/5.",

I don't think I've ever worked with such a great case in all my years.Honestly this case is full of good ideas and good execution, from dust filters to fan mounting to rad support. I squeezed a thicc 360 Corsair XR7 into the front a 240 XR5 up top and this thing runs cool as ice even when my 3080 is pushing 400W and my 10600K is flying high at 125W.Excellent cable runs in behind and plenty of depth behind the panel make this a dream for cable management. Lots of room to expand, even vertical GPU mounting is possible.If I had to have a gripe or two.... Maybe a fan splitter would be a nice addition, and some more space up top. I really wanted to mount another 360 rad up top, but I just couldn't squeeze it in. If the top was maybe a half inch higher and the case a half inch longer it would fit two XR7s. Also the included Corsair fans are garbage like usual. I swapped them out for some grey Noctuas up top and Cooler Master RGB Sickleflows in the front.Otherwise this case is brilliant. The glass is gorgeous, the paint is good quality, the plastics are slick. Good job Corsair, you earned my money this time.",

My CPU temps sit at 31-32 when idle with light browsing. 50 max when playing Death Stranding at top settings. The GPU also maxes out at around 50 degrees. The noise levels are also low because of that. The fans rarely need to hit max; in fact, I\u2019ve seen my GPU fans dead most of the time. The whole case feels cold to touch.

If your initial component arrangement isn't optimal, the flexible inner walls make adjustments a breeze.- Perfectly accommodates the MAG Z790 TOMAHAWK motherboard.- Inclusion of 2 fans and a fan controller enhances its value proposition.- Maintenance is straightforward with easily detachable nets ensuring cleanliness.Cons:- Its weight (13.84kg / 30.51lbs) can be a drawback for those considering mobility. I initially contemplated transporting it from the EU to the UK but ultimately chose to purchase a second unit for the UK.I've always been partial to Corsair cases, having previously owned the 4000d airflow. Transitioning to the 5000d airflow feels like a significant upgrade. This model boasts an array of detachable compartments, increased easy-to-clean airflow nets, and the added functionality of a hinged glass door. The design is accommodating, allowing for greater ease when setting up, particularly when connecting cables and fans. Aesthetically, the case is a stunner\u2014sleek and modern. It's refreshing to see such a refined design at this price point. My initial reservations about fitting the Z790 TOMAHAWK were put to rest\u2014it integrates seamlessly.",
