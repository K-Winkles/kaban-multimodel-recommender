                "reviewText": "First thing out of the box is that this case is very well made. Even with all the struts removed, which as you can see is completely possible, there was zero flex or bend once mounted. The front fan assembly comes off with four screws to fit long pcie cards (cant get much bigger than an MSI 1080 ti gaming x in sheer bulk), the 5.25\" mounting bay comes off in another four screws, and the 'mystery u brace' above the power supply is a spot to mount an additional two 2.5\" drives. Using this as a home editing server is currently fantastic with very little airflow issues, however will be adding in two 40mm noctua fans on the backside, in which there is already mounting and protection for. Overall a fantastic case for any form of high power rack mounted builds, and will absolutely be coming back to RackChoice for future nas and jbod cases.",

While there is height for two drives of the main bracket, the bracket is not designed to take advantage of the space. I ended up ordering some stackable drive brackets that allow me to place the drives better but still allowing air space between the drives",

Picture attached.The front fan panel, the 5.25\" bays, the weird U shape metal above the PSU, it all comes off with a few screws. With everything (except the I/O+Expansion panel) taken off it's super easy to get everything installed.One thing that bothers me is the lack of places to mount drives. I believe you can mount 2.5\" drives to the cross brace's many mounting points but there isn't a single place to mount a 3.5\" drive. Hopefully you have an M.2 slot on your board.There are holes for a slide rail for Rack mounting but no rails. So sad. I had to bolt the server's face directly to the rack posts. The face is super strong and can take the full weight. It can be mounted to a telecomms rack like this. It just makes it kind of difficult to secure it to a rack without a hoist.",

                "reviewText": "I am usually a big fan of RackChoice products, but this one feels like a miss. The case itself is nice and sturdy. Once you get it all set up it is great. However, assembly is pretty much an adventure. There are no directions on how to install any of it. Also quite a bit cramped, which may be a problem for cooling with some builds.I recommend taking the time to figure out how to take out all the brackets before installing ANYTHING in this case. There are some tricks that if you aren't ready, you will be disassembling and reassembling multiple times. I repeat, TAKE A FEW MINUTES to figure out the layout, brackets, and screws before you start!!! You've been warned.The lack of instructions is a bit bonkers. Definitely not a case for a newbie computer builder!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the RackChoice 4U Depth 11.8\" M-ATX Server Chassis with the thought of having a server centrally located in a rack for my home network. Currently, I utilize a NAS as the server and want to get away from that function. I am now in the process of researching micro-ATX boards and CPUs for the build. However, this cabinet is heavy duty; not weak or flimsy as some cabinets tend to be. It is fairly weighty empty and am wondering if I will need to install the cabinet in the rack before building the server piece [including PSU]. I'll worry about that after I have all the parts. In the meantime, this rack chassis is a winner!",
