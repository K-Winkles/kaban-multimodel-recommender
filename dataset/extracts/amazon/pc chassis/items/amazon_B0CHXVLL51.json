I wasn't sure about the color at first but I've grown to really like it and the uniqueness compared to black or white cases. No issues so far, I just wish it had more USB-C ports. Lots of room for more fans and/or radiators. It would have been cool if the LED panel was bundled in at a discounted price, I'd like to buy it but I'm having a hard time justifying the extra $100 for looks.",

The included fans are also loud and do not move much air. I\u2019m not going to go through the hassle of returning it or disassembling my entire build over one crappie fan.

                "reviewText": "Initially the matcha color caught my eye so after building in it I'm quite surprised just how great the build quality is and the versatility this case has to accommodate various fan sizes. The best surprise was the rear pcie slots is a bracket that can be removed and rotated if you desire to vertically mount your gpu. The design is extremely user friendly to build in and there's ample room to work in, no issues with my E-ATX motherboard, 280mm radiator on the top, a 240mm radiator on the front of the case while still leaving room to fit a 140mm fan on the rear and another 120mm fan under the front radiator so every single fan slot is still utilized even with dual radiators. I love that thermaltake also has a matching AIO in the matcha color to go with this case and still left room for me to do a push/pull configuration on my radiator for my RTX 4090 Suprim X Liquid in the front of the case. Thermaltake really nailed it with this one and at an amazing price point. Outstanding value and i definitely recommend this case!",
