                "reviewText": "I gotta say what an amazing product. I have a Lancool 2 Mesh case and decided to take off front panel to replace with these filters. (The case's front panel is already mesh but the holes are 1.5mm compared to this 0.8mm, and my pc was gettin more dust than I wanted). This was so easy to do. Unroll the mesh, measure, mark with pencil, and cut. Any scissors will do, that's how ez it was. Magnets stick nicely, mesh didnt fall. I did filters for front panel and also top (see pics), and still got like 1/4 of the mesh leftover. As for quality, these mesh are solid, stiff (while still being ez enuff to be cut with scissors). Dont worry about your front intake fans sucking them and makin them flimsy. Definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This kit was a breeze to size and put together, and it's working great. The Phanteks p500a has a bit of an unusual front mesh panel, with machined angles that require some attention to detail to make a filter for, but it wasn't hard to do with the included materials and after making my filter I have enough material left over to make another one if the need arises. When I look at how much it would have cost to buy a pre-made product for this purpose, it would have been over $30 shipped, and even then I would have still worried about it not providing enough coverage for the angled air intake parts of the front panel (what good is a filter if it only blocks right in front of the fans - better than nothing, but it has to be over all of the possible intake area to stop dust getting in!). With this kit I was able to size it to fit and get it working in less than 20 minutes, and it is filtering really well.Great product, I recommend it!",

My ONLY gripe, is the way it is shipped. Comes in a tube with the mesh rolled up inside. It is a complete pain to work with to unroll to get it to lay flat. This was fixed by unrolling it, laying it flat and putting some heavy flat books on it to get it to lay flat. Once flat, SIMPLE to measure up, cut and add the magnetic strips! Doesnt seem to hinder the air flow much as under load temps didnt change at all with or without the mesh. Would recommend if you need to make your own dust covers!",
