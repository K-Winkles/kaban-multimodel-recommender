                "reviewText": "I used the Lancool 205 Micro case for my first PC build and I couldn't be happier! It's an amazing micro case and I absolutely loved how it turned out. I'm not at all an expert in PC building, but I hope that my feedback helps a bit!Here are my specs- GTX 1050- GIGABYTE B550M DS3H- Crucial Ballistix 3200 MHz DDR4- ARCTIC Freezer 34 eSports DUO- GIM KB-28 RGB Case Fans, 3 Pack White 120mm- EVGA 220-G3-0750-X1 Super Nova 750 G3, 80 Plus Gold 750W- Seagate BarraCuda 2TB Internal Hard Drive HDD- Crucial MX500 1TB- AMD Ryzen 5 3600Pros- Really easy to work with- Lots of different ways to route cables- Simple and minimalist design- Micro tower is small enough to fit on top of a desk without looking too big- Air flow on the back, top, front, below the psu, and on the sides of the front panel (enough to fit total of 5 fans // 1 fan in the back, 2 fans on the top, and 2 fans in the front)- Removeable Magnetic dust filters on the top and the bottom- Fits the ARCTIC Freezer 34 Esports (grey/white) PERFECTLY, goodness I was worried that my cpu cooler wouldn't fit, but it fit absolutely perfect with a tiny bit of room between the tempered glass and the front of the cpu cooler- the gap in the front is big enough to fit a custom rgb panel- the temps are nice! my GPU runs around 35-41\u00b0C- the glass feels very high qu (it's pretty heavy too!)Cons- I wasn't sure if this was the motherboard or the case (maybe it was just me?) but I found it very difficult mounting the motherboard onto the case. When I would screw the motherboard onto the case, I just could not get them to go inside. I managed to get the corners in, so I left it at that. This may have just been my fault though and I didn't want to strip the screws :'(- This is me just being a little picky, but I wish the little raised cable management things in the back of the case (I'm not sure what the technical term is) was slightly larger to fit bigger zip ties and velcro cable ties- I wasn't sure if the case was supposed to come with a mounting tray, but mine didn't come with any (I'm still not sure if the mounting is included or not) so I put my HDD in the drive bay and I placed my SSD right on top of the drive bay and zip tied it downOverall, the microATX case is absolutely beautiful and very well made! It's user-friendly and great for beginners that want a smaller build!",

                "reviewText": "Originally, I had intended to get the Corsair Crystal 280x, A nice, easy to assemble, and cable manage micro-atx case.However, I found this case right before I was about to order that case, and I am extremely glad I did.-For starters, the price is cheap- 70$ at the time of purchase, which is less than half than the Corsair Crystal 280x. For this price, you get exceptionally high build quality. All panels (all high-quality aluminium and tempered glass) fit perfectly and feel solid, as well as easily attach to the case. It comes with magnetic dust filters for the top and front of the case-Airflow is exceptional, and exhaust/intake restrictions are very little/none. My temps have dropped by 2-4 degress since implementing this case compared to my previous case (using corsair fans, not the stock fans). I had to mount my 240mm radiator for my AIO at the front of the case, as I could not get my fans and radiator to clear my RAM when mounting at the top. Even then, this likely varies from motherboard to motherboard.-The size! It's incredibly small, while maintaining easy part compatiblity (I've seen builds with 3080's fitting, no problem) It's still very easy to build in as long as you use a modular PSU, and you should. It's about the same height as other micro-atx cases, but much thinner. It having a basement certainly helps with the cable management.At the end of the day, I would reccoment this case for anyone building a Micro-ATX system, I'd even go as far to say this is the best bang-for-the-buck case option, maybe even the best in general.In Short:-Amazing Price-Looks Great-High Quality Build-Easy to Build in with Modular PSU-Fits most GPU's-Just get it",

                "reviewText": "The 205M Mesh case was a pleasure to build in and the cable management couldn't have been easier. It comfortably fits most components and, even without expensive braided cables, your build will look simple and elegant with minimal effort.Construction quality feels very sturdy and has no flimsiness whatsoever (a complaint that pops up in case reviews for other cases at this price point). There are no quirks about this case that I could find that made building in it problematic.If you're looking for micro-ATX case with plenty of wiggle room, good cable management, sturdy construction, and beautiful to look at, just go with this one.",
