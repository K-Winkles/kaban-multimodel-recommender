                "reviewText": "This is definitely a premium case in every sense, the layout, materials, and quality are all top notch. A joy to work with outside of how much it weighs, but it weighs as much as it does due to the thick metal they use so that may as well be a compliment. Personally I appreciate the matte finish of the Harbor Grey over the brushed metal texture of the other variants.The only thing to note is that the tint on this Harbor Grey model is rather aggressive. Personally that's what I wanted as it allows some rather bright LEDs to show up without being too visually loud and I think it looks clean, but if you don't run much lighting you'll struggle to see inside unless you game in direct sunlight.If I had to make a single complaint it'd be that I'm not a fan of the grey rubber grommets in the case as I'd prefer them to be black, but they're not especially prominent and the tint makes them harder to spot as well. This is pretty much my singular problem with the case, and it doesn't even matter.",

I could not fit a 360AIO in the case to help with cooling, So I decided to get a new case. I have never built a pc (mine was custom ordered online) but when I tell you this was one of the easiest thing I\u2019ve done I\u2019m not joking. This case is literally exactly what I needed. Aio fit and my pc temps have never been better.Cable management: 5/5Case build quality: 5/5Room for future upgrades: 5/5Airflow/cooling: 5/5Appearance: 5/5 (I got the grey)the case came with bushings for mounting fans and other stuff, which cut down on vibration and sound by ridiculous amounts. If there weren\u2019t lights inside I would never be able to tell it was on or off.Which brings me to The one and only thing I can say I do not like about the case. It is how dark the front glass is. It is bright at night but during the daytime you can hardly see the inside of the case. But that does not interfere with my love for the case. If you are debating on buying. Dooooo it you will not regret it!",
