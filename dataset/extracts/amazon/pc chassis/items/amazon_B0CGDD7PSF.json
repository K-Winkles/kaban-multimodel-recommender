                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great case for the price",
                "reviewText": "The case has a very thoughtful design. The unconventional layout of the components made for an easy build. The system breathes very well with all of the fans. It also looks great because you can really see the lights. Another unique feature that is the first I have seen it is a platter for the SSD and HDD. I fit 3 SDD and 1 HDD on the small platter very snug. The design of the platter is quite precision and the triple plug from the EVGA gold power supply fit perfectly with no additional slack. I was surprised at the perfect fit that almost seemed too small. The drives all screw down to a platter that fits perfectly in a well ventilated compartment. Easy build with ATX mobo. No problems at all.I would not say that case is perfect because there was two very minor issues that I had with it. One of the feet did not perfeclty screw down to the case as the other 3 did. It did not cause a balance problem though and the system does not wobble when standing up. So that was no biggie. The only other gripe that I have is that one of the rivets blocked where a screw was supposed to go. That had to be improvised a bit and as a result the rubber on one of my fans was messed up a bit. The only other comment that I would mention is about the dust. The holes on the case are exceptionally large and it is covered with them. It makes for great breathing but really no good for dust inside the box. I pute some makeshift paper towel filters over the bottom holes. There supposed to be a dust screen on the bottom but the holes are way too big to stop dust even though they are smaller than all of the other holes. I also put paper towel over the top of the top mounted water cooler. I know it would inhibit cooling just a bit but the system doesn't run too hot and it's a fair trade off for preventing tons of dust from falling right through. The radiator on the cooler won't stop dust from falling in and neither would the large holed case cover.All in all, I feel that I got a good value for the money and I am very happy with the build.One final note that I really like is the fact that you can see the right side fans very well through the glass and metal side of the case. I got some nice halo fans I guess it is standard LEDs on both sides. Well from both sides they look great even through the metal side of the case.",
