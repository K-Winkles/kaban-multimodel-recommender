                "reviewText": "This is a boutique/unique case, thus carries an equivalent price tag. Looks are subjective, so I won't comment on it besides saying its proportions look better in person and can serve as an excellent canvas for those aiming for a cyberpunk/mecha theme.Build quality is excellent as there were no blemishes, missing parts, or manufacturing defects that I could spot after a thorough inspection.While not terribly difficult to build in, the instructions are a bit spartan - especially regarding screw types and AIO/radiator installation. Speaking of AIO, if you've got thick rads and/or hoses (e.g., Liquid Freezer 2) then be aware that you'll be forced to place the hoses in the top position.Also, the ARGB connectors for the LED strips are a bit short if your motherboard's connectors are at the bottom-middle or bottom left. Luckily, I had one available near the main power connector (upper-right corner).Beyond that, this case is a dream to build in as every panel/section is removable via screws, but be sure you take note of each part as the manual doesn't cover full disassembly/reassembly!Lastly, I love the semi-open frame-modular design (and multiple 120mm fan mounts) as it makes cooling a non-issue and as I stated in the title: it fits the RTX 4090 Aorus Master - the largest consumer-grade GPU currently available.",

                "reviewText": "I have to say, after completing this case and looking at it, I love it, love it, love it! But I also have to say that it's a bit of a PITA to build a PC in it.Firstly, the instructions aren't in any real kind of order. For example, the first thing they show you is how/where to install the motherboard. Fine, but if you do that, then you'll not be able to mount your SSDs on the back side. I should have realized this, so it's partially my fault. Even so ...Next, the placement of the PSU is fine, except it's a PITA to connect cables either to the PSU or from the PSU to the motherboard and GPU. There's just no room to get your hands in there and many of the cables were to short to connect them if the PSU was outside the case. I had to come up with a few creative ways to connect it all up.There were a few other areas where it was pretty difficult to get a screw in place due to how tight some areas were or something being in the way.As a result of these issues, it took me longer to build this system than it normally would have and I experienced a few moments of frustration over what I thought would be a fairly simple build. However, having said that, I still love this case. It looks fantastic and my PC is running super-cool, even though I am using air cooling instead of water. The case is also very well built. I am very pleased with the quality of the case overall.So, yes, I would definitely recommend this case to someone looking to create an outstanding looking PC, just be prepared for a few inconveniences while building it.",
