                "reviewText": "Bought this case to start my rack mount of some of the servers I use for a NAS system. The MB I had was an ATX MB, and I have a hot swap kit to fit 4 3.5 inch drives to fit in the 3 5 1/4\" space. When I went to do the swap, the first thing I found was that the edge of the motherboard was under the power supply, which made getting some of the connectors from the chassis difficult. I then went to put in the 5 1/4 case, and it didn't fit.I did have another server I will also move to rack mount with the right size MB, so I wound up doing a brain swap, and putting the smaller MB in.One other thing to note: you need a long thin screwdriver to get to the mounts for the 5 1/4\" drive. My 1/4\" driver was too thick, Fortunately I had a long driver, and a spare magnet I pulled from a dead hard drive to get the screws back in.One last word of advice if you are using the 5 1/4\" drive space - check the clearance between the back of the drives and your Power Supply of choice. My PS has modular cables which wound up lining up with the SATA ports on the back of the drive chassis. As I am writing this, I noticed an EVA non modular power supply next to me that would have been much easier to fit in the case. But I would have had a lot of unneeded cables.Overall I recommend with the proper look at the space you need.",

The standoffs do not support the main board at the correct heights, so needed to purchase and install some standoffs as shims. Additionally, some of the built in standoffs seems to have stripped or incorrect thread pitch / size. These issues are not deal breakers, just add a little extra work to the build. The USED item also arrived missing the front panels for the drive bays. Also not a big deal as I am planning to install drives in all the bays.",

                "reviewText": "The 3U RackChoice looks like a good choice. Build quality feels solid, though I haven't tried loading it with hot-swap bays and heavy mechanical drives. It came with front and rear fans installed, though they don't have tachometer signal so you can't easily utilize a \"fan-failure\" alert on the motherboard. The front fans have a cage that holds a preinstalled foam filter, and it is accessible from the outside. The perforated 5.25\" bays don't have a filter, so you might want to cover them with finer mesh or foam depending on your application. The PSU can be installed to draw air either from the inside of the case or from above, which I think is a nice idea to accommodate different rack configurations. The front USB ports could be convenient for loading offline updates or driver installs. With all of the drive bays it could make for a good DIY NVR, NAS, or media library/player.",

                "reviewText": "So my use case may not the same as most but I believe some of my observations will be relevant. I am trying to mount a gaming PC in the case with a rather large GPU and 3 5.25 drives with no hard drives (just onboard NVME).Case Size / Design - Overall, the case could be a couple of inches deeper to make things much easier. The power supply has only a couple of inch clearance with the 5.25 drives and you obviously have a lot of hookups in this space. The drive cages are not very serviceable. Need a long magnetic screwdriver to get to the screws ... have to be completely disassembled to change anything since nothing is toolless. There are also 4 small screws to hold the lid on. Really would like to see a retained thumbscrew or two no the back to secure the lid instead to allow for easy access. Again, this case was not designed with serviceability in mind.Included Fans - The fans are Molex powered in 2023 ... so you will likely end up paying the fan tax to get something PWM/quiet. Never understood loud fans for consumer-grade server stuff. This stuff goes in our house so not sure why you would want loud fans in any situation. These were not screaming loud like commercial server equipment, but they should be PWM for who this case is targeted at. For the 60mm fans, I could only find Noctua so about $30+ for 2 fans. Everything else seemed to be 2 or 3 pin in this size. I would also put 1 120mm fan in front rather than the 2 80mm fans. I ended up 3d printing a simple adapter and actually installed an AIO in this spot. I, of course, took the 3.5\" drive bays out to do this.So there could be many design improvements here. It seems like this was designed in CAD but not tested much in real-world situations.On the plus side, the construction seems to be good (enough) quality. The price is also very reasonable.",

                "reviewText": "This rack mount case is practical option for a server chassis. In my home office setup, this server chassis has proven to be more than adequate. Made of powder-coated stamped steel, it may not boast fancy features but gets the job done. However, there are no built-in provisions for filter material, so some DIY measures are be necessary to keep dust at bay. I used small magnets to cover the openings with filter material and prevent dust accumulation.PROS- Solid construction and durability- Sufficient support for low-spec servers and home use- Versatile fan options for coolingCONS- Lack of provisions for filter material- Front thumb screw may require replacement due to binding issuesThis is a reliable and functional choice for low-spec servers and home use. There are a few minor drawbacks but provides a good value.While this chassis is a solid choice, considering that it doesn't include any fans, rails, or power supply, other more expensive options might offer a better overall deal. Five stars from me. I hope this helps to make a decision.",
