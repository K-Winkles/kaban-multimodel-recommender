                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Its a really nice, budget case that does the job. I got a corsair rmx 850 watt power supply into it.",
                "reviewText": "Its a nice case and despite being fairly small there is a good amount of space in here. The case is fairly thin metal which makes it feel cheap but does it matter when its just sitting somewhere? In fact it may even be a good thing, less metal = less weight. And the plastic panel is light as a feather too. The parts inside will weight it down nicely. The case has a few usb ports at the top, and 3 fans included which is real nice. The fan at the back uses this tiny 3 pin cable that connects to the motherboard, the two front fans use this big molex pin connecter, my power supply had a cable for those thankfully. So the only one controlled by the motherboard is the back fan. They are pretty quiet fans tho, so running at full speed isn't really an issue imo. There is a hard drive area and it comes with a few plastic caddy guides you use to install them in the case, real nice for big storage.Now lets talk about the issue ppl have with this case: The power supply area.People are on here complaining about the power supply space and I'll admit it IS cramped but you can get a pretty big one in there with some patience. Really the problem is the cables being chunky, this corsair rmx 850 w has some of the chunkiest cables I've ever seen. They are massive, thick, woven cables and EVEN then with some problem solving I got them all in, no cutting the case or anything required. The trick is, connect up all the cables first to the power supply if you are using modular and get the power supply in first. The huge motherboard one you may wanna thread in first but other than that do it after, because getting the power supply in will be impossible otherwise, the cables get in the way and you kind of have to angle it in. Then once its in you can carefully thread all the rest of the cables in. I know you may be thinking I cheated, using modular because I only used the ones I needed. WRONG. I installed several extras for less hassle in the future, even two extra pcie power cables direct from the supply for an RTX 30-series upgrade soon. I used up almost all the cables included, trust me you can get it all in.This is a good case, and I love the aesthetic. That ps2 ribbed look is a look I love and my laptop is a G5 with that look too. And in the case of this case there is a mesh behind the ribs so you get really good airflow. There is a magnetic filter at the top of the case and a slide one underneath the case for the power supply. Unfortunately not all the vents are covered by removable meshes. But this is a budget case so I'm okay with that. Overall I really recommend this one!",

                "reviewText": "For $55~, this case is very good. It looks great and has a tempered glass side panel, good cable management, and good front IO. It was spacious enough to build an M-ATX build inside of and had very good cable routing. One issue I ran into was that the screws seemed to strip and either get stuck or not screw in very easily, but at this price point, I don't believe this is entirely outrageous and as long as you're careful not to use a comically large screw for the hole you need, you should be okay, haha. The three fans it came with seem adequate, and again, for this price, I have no complaints about these fans. The rear fan connects to the motherboard via a header and the two front fans connect together via molex which will plug into a PSU no problem. Comes with plenty of screws and even some zip ties for cable management which is a thoughtful and appreciated inclusion.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great case. It offer a ton of value for the price, especially if you get the acrylic option.It comes with 3 pre-installed fans: 2 up front as intake and one exhaust. They work fantastic, keeping my i3 12100f and RX 6700 XT nice and cool. My only complaint is that they\u2019re noticeably loud, but not distractingly so, especially with headphones on.The case itself is well constructed and comes with everything you need to put together a system inside it. Its a little cramped to build in because its not a full size tower, and cable management falls a little flat as there isn\u2019t much space to route cables behind that back panel.All-in-all though, its an amazing buy. The only thing i would change about it are the fans, but you can just get a nice 5-pack of Antec fans and fully pack your case with fans. For me though, the 3 pre-installed ones work perfectly fine.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for a server PC I'm throwing together and hiding in a closet. Paid $59.61.Pros: Cheap, super light, It's a case, Gets the job done. Looks decent in my opinion.Cons: cheap materials, small area for PSU, access holes for cables to motherboard are covered if using an ATX board. Front fans are molex. PSU cover(basement)& drive bay are riveted on instead of screwed so no removing for easy access/install.Things of note:-PCI port brackets at back are punch outs. Case came with 3 reusable ones, 1 installed and 2 in the plastic pouch with screws and whatnot.-The case is flimsy, installing the rear IO shield caused the metal of the case to twist and bend which caused concern. It did bend back once installed though.-The space for a modular PSU cables is about 2-3 inches from PSU to drive bay, I've got medium size hands and had to use pliers to install cables to the PSU since my hands could not fit in that space, I recommend pre-installing needed modular cables before installing the PSU. My EVGA 850 semi-modular barely fit in the hole for installation had probably 2mm of space between the case, lip for the side panel, and the top of the shroud.Hyper 212 EVO barely fits, top of the copper heat pipe might be touching the window not sure. But hey it fits. :)-Has a dust filter for the top fan ports(magnetic), and PSU port. But there is not one at the front for the pre-installed intake fans...-Front... Top? IO panel circuit board is visible from the window, doesn't matter to me just something to note.-Frame for the side panel makes tall/larger screw drivers difficult to use when screwing in motherboard.",
