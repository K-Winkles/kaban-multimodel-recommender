                "reviewText": "Great case. Fans that came with the case are super quiet and look beautiful and lots of room for everything you need. I love that the power supply goes behind the motherboard so it makes cable management a breeze. Will say, the only minor thing I'd add to make this case A+++ is to lift the motherboard slightly off the bottom (ATX board) so that a few holes can be accessible to hit the bottom of the motherboard for cabling. Fans on the bottom do a decent job of hiding the cables like header/RGB but as the builder, I know they are there. I would highly recommend this case as an alternative to NZXT's H9 elite (too pricey for what you get plus fans) and also, the USB header being where it is instead of on top the case is a brilliant move.Overall out of 100, i've rate this a 98/100 just due to there not being holes underneath the motherboard for cable management.",
