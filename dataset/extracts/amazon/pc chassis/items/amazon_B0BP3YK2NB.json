                "reviewText": "I haven't upgraded my own case in about 6 years. It was about time, as I was upgrading my PC parts, and this really was the only case that STUCK out. That fractal design on the front and tempered glass look super nice, and a lot of reviews looked splendid.I honestly avoided most RGB cases, I didn't want to be all \"Flashy\" and have that \"Epic Gamer\" set up, I enjoyed my 2 separate fans up front, that just worked. no set up. but this case made setting up RGB on the reset switch on the front panel super easy. Plenty of different Motherboard adapters for the RGB controller as well, which come nicely labeled. Everything was already plugged in and set up to run off an adapter so I only needed to plug a single fan header in. SUPER convenient, as I was building 3 PC's that night, that was a total time saver, along with that adapter being labeled so neatly.This case was off to great start, It was super easy to work with, had everything I needed set up pretty much out of the box, and it looked pretty sick.I did have to look up a review online to see how to mount my SSD, as the case only came with screws and zip-ties, no manual, unless I missed it somewhere...But that's really minimal.The whole design is very sleek, and the inside is VERY spacious, My current parts a bit big, they took up most of my old case, as I have a asus ROG GTX 1080 ( 3 fans on this GPU, so she's a loooong boi) and I also have a Nocture D15S to cool my CPU, and that's a pretty sizable cooler, but it fits perfectly in this case, I still have plenty of wiggle room, if that's any idea of how much room you might have. I still have space in there.Plenty of spots for cable management with Zip-ties, or twist ties, whatever you use. Honestly really cleans up well back there.The air flow is TOP notch, with those 3 fans in the front, they do a really good job, my PC breathes VERY well with this case, as there's just a lot of air flow.Honestly, the whole case felt very catered to my needs.Glad I purchased, and I hope if you buy, you feel the same! It's a really great case!Thanks Cooler Master!",

                "reviewText": "During the unboxing I felt a bit underwhelmed as the case felt very light. My previous case was extremely heavy out of the box. I was also worried about space and cable management as I have two old school spinning drives as well as a solid state. This, along with the power supply looked as though it may be a bit cramped and although it was tight, everything fit well and the payoff of not seeing any of those cables was worth it. I love the box that hides the PS and it's a great spot for your favorite Funko Pop.The cable management was better than I thought it would be as I was able to hide nearly every cable in the back. There are plenty of little holes all over the place where you can route cables. I also like that the front and top are basically open grates for great air flow. Dust build up may be a problem but time will tell.The front glass is very solid and heavy, the included fans worked great out of the box and the white interior/exterior look amazing with the lights aglow. Once my build was complete I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and have had many compliments. The price does seem a bit high for what you get but the included fans make it a bit easier to swallow.Overall I would highly recommend this case, especially if you can get it on sale.",

                "reviewText": "This case is great. I was initially considering a Corsair 4000D Airflow, a tried and true option, but stumbled upon this case.It has comparable airflow to the 4000D but is slightly bigger which allows it to very comfortably fit a top mounted 360 length liquid cooler. It has excellent cable management with plenty of spots to sneak cables and hooks to tie cables to on the back panel. I have a 4070 which fits with no problem. A friend got a 4090 and that also had no trouble in this case.It comes with 3 120mm ARGB fans which are all pre-wired into a hub on the back panel making for easy to setup. The prismatic shaped mesh combined with the ARGB fans looks great. I also appreciate that they don't include the Cooler Master logo (which IMO isn't the best looking) but just a hexagon shape cutout on the mesh (which looks nice and prevents airflow being impeded).It is on the bigger size for a mid-size case and doesn't really have good spots for product stickers that may come with your CPU/GPU etc.",

                "reviewTitle": "Fits a 280mm double liquid cooler radiator but....",
                "reviewText": "This unit is great, it looks fabulous, it has excellent airflow it also has lots of lighted fans, however. If you have a regular ATX motherboard and you have or want to use a 280mm double or triple liquid cooler radiator you will not be able to fit them in the case together. after I installed my full ATX motherboard into this unit I then found that I could not fit my 280mm double3 fan radiator in the top of the case, the Ram dimms on the motherboard get in the way of the fan, and before you ask, the 280mm radiator does not fit in the forward position only on the top of the case, so I was forced to take my dremmel to cut slots in one of my Fan shrouds to allow room for the Dimms to fit when I installed the fans. This would definitely be a deal breaker for many out there, but I wasn't going to return the 280MM fans and radiator and pay more for the 240mm version, so I modified the fans to allow everything to fit. Other than this \"little\" problem the case is excellent and the design of the case is overall excellent. The wire routing can give you an extremely clean install with only a tiny bit of wires visible and the sculpted glass door on the left side is seriously cool and yes, it is Glass, not polycarbonate. the overall construction quality is excellent and is perfect for someone who is looking for a good quality case I have zero complaints about this case, with the exception of it saying it will fit a 280mm dual fan radiator as this is only technically true, but don't expect to fit your full size Motherboard afterwards. So my advice is that if you like this case and also want to use a dual fan radiator do not buy a 280mm unit, but buy the 240mm triple, double or single radiator. If you intend to install a single 280mm fan radiator I think that there should be enough room for it and the motherboard, but no double and a triple will not fit this case at all.",
