The pre installed fans are nice but can get pretty noisy after some time especially after things start to heat up. Maybe the only downside is the small holes for the front fans restricting the air but besides this, its a great value for the price would highly recommend if your looking for something not as boring as a normal case.",

                "reviewText": "Could not imagine a more unique colorful excellently designed computer case design that is easy to install with its great access and spacious compartments. This is for my wife's birthday and is very compatible with her love of two ways mirrors that are a unique part of the design for the front face- She loves it. The two glass mirror front and the large glass side panel make the total weight heavier than most but provides the feel of a rugged case design. The flat black finish on all compartments and surfaces of the case add a quality appearance. The LED controls were a little confusing at first until it was pointed out that extra wiring is provided for total simultaneous control of all lights installed in the computer if desired. If not only the power cable is needed for the internal two way mirror LED lights to operate normally. Glad I saw this on Amazon and with a quick two day delivery.;",

                "reviewText": "Looks great. Definitely worth the ~$50 I spent. No fans, but I wanted to cram as many in it as I could (8 total or 6 and a 2 fan CPU cooler). Really like the mirror finish on the front. The inside is spacious and I've had a variety of motherboards in it with no issue. It isn't as deep front to back as I would like but there is enough room.",

I somehow fit a very large build into this tiny case! It is mid-tax, but is pretty small. Which is what I was looking for. It fit my 4 drives, 3 fan AIO, 6 fans, RTX 3090. A lot of bang for such a small footprint. Love it.",

                "reviewText": "Fans are fairly loud but pretty. The front panel does not have enough clearance to move air into case, making push-pull impossible. The entire front is solid to accommodate the infinity lighting. The lower brace does have vents to pull air above power supply cutout, so updraft is hard. I personally voided warranty by drilling my own lower intake fan air vents. No space to route wiring on side if using non-modular PSU. No covers over backplane slots. This case has three fans and RGB controller with remote, so looks are trend setting. If your build is not structured to control heat, this is a great showpiece.",

                "reviewText": "I built with this case obviously for aesthetics as there are very little infinity mirror cases sadly. As my altar to Zenitsu here, he can fit in the case but I just don\u2019t want air flow to be impeded. Thermals are fine, I just have the case open and top mesh removed bc this new graphics card I got on sale, this 3090ti gets so damn hot, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll get too hot. I think it\u2019ll be the same for any mid tower case unfortunately. But you\u2019re not buying this case for that, are you?Maybe next year I\u2019ll move it to something bigger to properly house this build but a pc case and GPU upgrade is all you really need to feel like you have a new computer.Anyways, I\u2019m getting off topic. The CPU cooler is a Vetroo U6PRO, which was unintentionally matching the whole \u201cX\u201d theme. I like how the case has a LED button right on top, really easy to changeI like the added \u201cUSB C port on top\u201d as optional but I can\u2019t for the life of me find the actual cable online that I would need for that. Comes with 4 pretty good fans, plenty of space for wiring. The usb hub for the fans and leds is massive. I have like 9 fans going into that thing, major plus. Save yourself the hassle and use some double sided tape to move it around to better optimize cable placement.The only things I don\u2019t like are that the bottom feet are foam and not rubber so it slides easily on hard wood. May be a pro or con depends on who you ask. Also the back gpu slots weren\u2019t screwed on. They don\u2019t just screw them on and off like other cases. Weird little quirk. You literally have to pop them off like they\u2019re pringle can lids. Can be sharp so I would suggest using pliers. Make sure you take off the right ones because you can\u2019t take them off if you do.",
