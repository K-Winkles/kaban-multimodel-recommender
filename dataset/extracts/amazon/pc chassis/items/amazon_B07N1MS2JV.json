                "reviewText": "Purchased this case for my new PC build as i switched from AMD to the new intel 1700 12gen processor. Had to start over with new everything and this looked like the perfect case after much searching. I have to say im impressed, the quality of the material, design and layout are all great. Yes it does a pretty good job of keeping things quiet and airflow is good too. And an added plus its fairly simple but modern sleek design allows for plenty of surface space for custom paint. See attached pictures to see the before and after if you're curious.Cons, not much room in the bottom for harddrives/storage if you use them. Considering most newer builds need those larger PSUs to provide that extra power you loose a lot of space, especially with all the cabling. Aside from that i dont really have anything else con wise about the case to mention.As a mention of note, i had to order, return and reorder this case three times due to the warehouse sending me the wrong white case until i just gave up and purchased the gray one instead. With a week turn around each time and calls to amazon i just gave up lol. In the end it the case is still superb imo. Just keep the above in mind if you order the glacier white and they send you the matte.",

                "reviewText": "I've seen this in several reviews, I'm just one more to say it: The Phanteks Eclipse P600S is the best case I've ever owned. Overall it's a feature set combo that takes the quiet-airflow concept into an anthracite monolith of doom. Some things are quirky, like sliding panels over more traditional rubber grommet style to hide cable management (which can be removed). If you are going for controlled maxed airflow with the respective abundant fans, easy access and removal while sealing up leaky case regions. Paired with a BeQuiet power supply on display. Why I love this case:The Empire Strikes Back, even though not endorsed or marketed as such, you understand. Side panels are lined with rubber gaskets for noise, vibration, and air pressure control. All panels lined with quality sound dampening material. Top and front all metal fan panels are magnetic and metal powder coated excellence. Beautiful tempered glass side door option really isn't...an option. Crafted per Darth Vader, also standard server equipment on an AT-AT Imperial Walker. All this solid metal construction does come at the cost of a heavier finished build, but it's worth it, still not bad to lift and manage. Feels solid, lift from front and back bottom. Four included drive bays mount under the power supply shroud, out of the way but exposed to the bottom front fan, thanks! Additional three mounting points for SSD's behind the motherboard, all easily removed/installed taking off the back panel. 7 hard drives, 8 if you have a PCIe SSD stick. The amount of space/options for cable management/routing is the best I've seen in a case. Ever. Abundant included Velcro tie points and pass-throughs, convenient channel above the motherboard. The honeycomb front and top cloth vent panels for maximum airflow is unique hair/dust inhibiting. Neatly behind the fully removable front assembly/panel is a fine dust filter, also magnetic. My favorite inclusion has to be the chassis front and top as entirely separate assemblies, they pop and slide away respectively. No power button light/USB/fan cables tethering or any garbage to the case. Just, hey there's my overpriced LED RGB fans. And an integrated 6 port fan hub. How nice.The quirks:Quirk 1: I've seen it with other gear, the little cloth loop handle to open the back panel, which tucks discreetly in the side vent. It works, not having it would not work well. Saw reports of tight-fitting door hinges, which have apparently been remedied, doors lift up and come off no problem and can be carefully bent.Quirk 2: This is an industry quirk, not just Phanteks, why put the passthrough 1.5 inches above or below where this naturally and sensibly wants to go to create a nice neat 90 Degree horizontal angle?Quirk 3: No bottom fan mount location (aside from the fan in your power supply, which if good is all you really need there). With seven chassis/cooler fan options top front and back, who cares.Bottom line: This case is awesome.",

                "reviewText": "Phanteks cases and fans are very good overall and support team is top notch. The Eclipse is loaded with features and it\u2019s nearly as large as a full tower case. Building a computer and upgrading components inside will be easier with the Eclipse than the majority of other mid-tower options. The stock fans keep things cool. The fans may not spin fast, but their design allows them to effectively push a lot of air and keep it moving without having to ramp up to insane rpm\u2019s. The case is insulated. According to Phanteks, it used sound insulation designed to reduce fan noise emanating from within the case. Hard drive bays can be installed in 3 different locations. The included fan hub is convenient and straightforward. Cable management is a cinch. The front I/O has two USB A and one USB C connectors, a reset button, and separate audio and mic auxiliary ports. Audio and microphone quality thru the front I/O is fantastic. It transmits loud, high quality sound with no interference. The Eclipse has plenty of clearance for fans and radiators and the tracks on the top and front of the case allow multiple cooling configurations.The side panels open wide and are removeable, which makes everything accessible. The front and top panels can be removed as well. Leaving them on suppresses fan noise, but they restrict airflow somewhat. Removing them increases airflow but fan noises are more audible. In my experience, the front and top panels can be left on most of the time without negatively affecting the temperatures inside the case. However, under extreme loads removing the front and/or top panel can lower temperatures a tad. Airflow is good enough that removing the panels only made a difference of a few degrees. The best way to improve airflow is to upgrade the fans to something like the Phanteks PH-F140MP_BBK02, and then tweak the fan curve on the motherboard. But only people who push their computers hard will need to upgrade the fans. In its stock configuration, the Eclipse is rated as one of the coolest mid-size towers on the market. My experience confirms that.I will nitpick a few things. The PSU shroud cannot be removed. That is a bit odd considering the versatility of the case. The space behind the motherboard (where the cables are) is a bit narrow in proportion to the massive size of the case. That space isn\u2019t narrower than other cases (it\u2019s wider than my last case), but a few millimeters of extra space would\u2019ve been appreciated. Lastly, the tracks that secure the fans are thin. They aren\u2019t flimsy, but they don\u2019t feel as sturdy as the rest of the case.Overall, this is an excellent case. It has a simple, modern ascetic that doesn\u2019t scream \u201cGamer\u201d and it\u2019s available with clear or solid panels. Solid panels are surprisingly uncommon these days, but that\u2019s my preference. The solid panel option looks slick and should offer better cooling and noise suppression because of the additional insulation. The Eclipse is quieter and cooler than my previous Thermaltake cases, and it outperforms the cases my friends use for their computers by a longshot. The sound insulation works well enough that I can have the computer on my desk just a few feet from my head and I hear nearly nothing when gaming and watching videos.",

Me encanta quese puedan instalar ventiladores de 140mm y que ya traiga 3 incluidos. He mejorado el airflow de mi sistema usando menos ventiladores y mis temperaturas redujeron 10 grados en carga m\u00e1xima, eliminando todo estrangulamiento posible.Se puede desmontar todo, se puede trabajar c\u00f3modamente tanto desde el lado izquierdo como desde adelante o de arriba. La fuente se mete desde detr\u00e1s.La gr\u00e1fica se puede colocar vertical con un ryzer, quiz\u00e1 una pega que se encuentra es que los disipadores de las tarjetas de 2022/23 ocupan m\u00e1s de tres ranuras, dej\u00e1ndo los ventiladores demasiado cerca del cristal si se coloca en vertical la GPU.Trae un hub para ventiladores, esto ahorra muchos dolores de cabeza en conectar y ahorra tener que comprar uno.No hay conexi\u00f3n de aire entre el ventilador de la fuente y el compartimento principal, por lo que obligatoriamente la fuente deber\u00e1 tomar aire desde abajo, donde se incluye un filtro.Trae cuatro bah\u00edas de discos duros antiguos en caso de que tengas y tres bah\u00edas de ssd o disco peque\u00f1o justo detr\u00e1s de la mother, estas se sacan y ponen mediante un mecanismo de gomas.El cristal templado y la tapa trasera traen bisagras y se pueden retirar para trabajar seguros. En el caso del modelo Eclipse, el cristal est\u00e1 levemente tintado de negro, lo que le da un toque elegante.Todo se sujeta firmemente y se retira sin mucho esfuerzo, hay imanes y belcro por doquier.Adelante y arriba puedes poner las tapas en invierno y quitarlas en verano, todas las partes vienen con material de insonorizaci\u00f3n, por lo que es muy silenciosa de por s\u00ed esta caja.Por nombrar m\u00e1s facilidades, hay tadas al costado de la mother para pasar cables y debajo de la parte delantera de la gr\u00e1fica para pasarle sus cables pcie de manera de que queden con cierta elegancia.Es una caja que recomiendo mucho montar, es calidad y tiene de todo.",
