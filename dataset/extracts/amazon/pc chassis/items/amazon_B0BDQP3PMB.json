As far as noise, it is quieter than the Lancool 3 that I replaced by quite a large margin.Now to the not so great part: the instructions. I have never in my life seen instructions this horrible. There is no order to go in and just random areas that say hey bud, here is how you put together this part. I knew I was in trouble when on the first page it shows a completed build and tells me how to install the base. I highly recommend watching some YouTube build videos to get a better idea of how to do this but don't let this stop you from buying the case. Once you figure out the install, it really is incredible.",

                "reviewText": "Thermaltake Core P3 Pro was purchased for use as a test bench, replacing an ALAMENGDA AL02 bench that my system has outgrown. As a test bench, the Core P3 Pro provides adequate space and mounting points for all system components and the capability to route/hide system cables within the chassis base. With the included rubber feet attached to the chassis base/side, the Core P3 Pro can be placed flat on the work table for easy component access (see attached picture) or sit upright to save workspace. The included adjustable GPU support bracket is hefty and the best that I've encountered.Build quality is excellent and assembly is straight forward, although the included fasteners are all packaged together, making it tedious to identify which are needed for each application. The pictorial based assembly instructions were complete and easy to follow.An irritating problem with the Core P3 Pro is the poor quality chassis USB Type C port/cable. The pre-installed cable is a thin ribbon type and although advertised as USB 3.2 Gen2 capable, it cannot support USB3.2 Gen2 speed/power requirements With the cable connected to my Strix Z790-E motherboard USB-C front panel header, the OS warns of USB failure and then freezes whenever attempting to transfer large files with an external USB-C type NVMe enclosure. The Thermaltake cable is definitely the problem source, since with a Graugear USB 3.2 Type-C header cable connected to the motherboard header, large files transfer at USB3 Gen2.2 rated speed without causing system/OS failure. The Core P3 Pro is not recommended if front panel USB-C capability is important.",

The chassis is vesa mountable if you want to wall mount and a glass front but the rest is wide open air. Again if you're looking for an open-air case besides your typical bench case applications which really aren't for everyday use this is the way to go.",

I legitimately do not know if my unit is just damaged and this is why absolutely nothing lined up? But legitimately nothing lined up, my case has no gpu bracket because it legitimately can't fit as it doesn't line up, it shorted my motherboard multiple times and had to buy larger standoffs to prevent it. My case has no gpu support so I have to lay it on the side since I have nothing golding my gpu in. It is such a shame as I have spent $4,000 on my pc parts recently and really wanted this case to work. Now I just have a box filled with high end pc parts. I could return this but honestly it's not worth the hassle at this point. I spent several days trying to fix things and make the case work in the way it is. Higher discourage anyone from buying this case until they updated the packaging to have instructions.",

A side radiator install can interfear with huge E-ATX boards, especially with side facing connectors. I use Phobya fan spacers for better/quieter air flow thru radiator, blowing air across mobo and gpu. Dead quiet (when gaming some air noise), and best cooling ever! Surprisingly sturdy, but I won't be moving it with glass on. I'm adding a 420 Phobya grill on front over radiator for decor and protection.",

The added mounting bracket for the front(or back/top) is a big plus if you wanted more customization than the previous P3 version. Overall this is a welcomed upgrade from the (still very nice) P3 with more space in a surprisingly smaller size which means this case is a definite buy for anyone who enjoys customization and aesthetics. The only downside is the instructions can be challenging to read as the steps don\u2019t necessarily go in order but a quick youtube search will give you more than enough step by step instructions to make putting it together a breeze.",

Just rebuilt in this badboy and wow just wow my computer looks unbelievable. the instructions are not great and the build does require some prior knowledge of PC building, I wouldn't recommend this case for beginners, there is ZERO handholding, almost like playing Elden Ring for the first time. this is my fourth build and I came across tons of issues, but hey I am a bit of a dumb dumb. fans look amazing, rgb looks great. thermals dropped 30%. I couldn't be happier. Not sure what part the other reviewer was looking for, as he didn't specify, but keep in mind this does not come with a PCI extension for your GPU so if you wish to run it vertically it requires a $100+ dollar part, which sucks. because HYTEs cases come with them for the same price point. I bought this at 250 cdn and it seems it be already on sale, which isn't an amazing sign for support but right now for this style of case, it is worth it but just keep those cons in mind !",
