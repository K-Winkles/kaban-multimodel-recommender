                "reviewText": "I bought this case for several reasons. First was the style. I liked that the front had a different look and that it was mesh for maximum airflow. Second was that it already had 3 fans installed. The front 2 are ARGB and the rear is just a plain fan. Third is how easy it is to organize your build and for cable management. I read several reviews complaining about the ARGB not working on their builds for different reasons. Several said they just didn't work. I thought maybe that was going to be the case with mine as well until I discovered that you have to hold the \"LED\" switch on top of the case for 3 seconds to allow the light control to be accessed by any of the ARGB programs out there. I used MSI Mystic Light and also I tried iCUE. Both controlled the lights perfectly. As far as hook ups, the fans are PWM fans so they each have one 4 pin wire that connects to the motherboard on the \"System Fan\" connections and then each fan has a 3 pin connector that hooks to a supplied and mounted ARGB control board and the control board hooks the the 3 pin ARGB connector on the motherboard, in the case of my MSI B550M it was the \"JRAINBOW1\". Everything fit great in the case and I have plenty of room to expand with another SSD or a bigger and better GPU when the prices come down. And the overall look is great! I definitely recommend this case if you want nice features at a really great price.",

                "reviewText": "When I was building a PC for my brother, he had selected this case due to it's stylish front panel design. Though I personally didn't feel it stood out at first, it definitely looks really good with 2 (up to 3) RGB fans on the front panel.Building in it was overall very good, with a few things I'd recommend keeping a look out for.1 - The rubber grommets holding in the glass side panel come out quite easily. They go back in easy enough, but be careful not to lose them when taking off the panel.2 - The case itself is also quite narrow/shallow. I didn't run into any clearance issues with the Vetroo Air Cooler I bought, but there was a bit of squeezing to get the rear fan to fit with the Aorus Wifi Motherboard we chose.3 - The case uses m3 motherboard screws, not imperial ones. Granted there are much more m3 screws in the baggie that imperial, but yeah I fiddled around a bit long trying to screw in imperial ones.Those were nitpicks but there's quite a lot of good things as well:1 - Quite roomy and fits the ATX motherboard we had with no problems.2 - A good deal of sidepanel space for cable management. I didn't have a problem closing it, though I did spend a lot of time tidying up.3 - Looks excellent with the included ARGB fans and ARGB controller hub. There's even a button near the front IO to switch between patterns.4 - Good front IO choices. 2 USB-A 3 (I forget what generation) as well as a 3.5mm jack and other buttons.5 - A very good bargain at the price I paid for it - $60.Overall, very happy with this case. It came out looking fantastic for the price, and I wish we had a better desk to display it in all it's glory.",

                "reviewText": "Sturdy and easy to work with. Space for a radiator. Solid airflow.With a standard ATX board, plugging in SATA drives to the mobo is a trick, unless you want wires visible up front. They didn't leave any cutouts at the bottom right of the board.The cable management is interesting, with double rings straddling the main cable run - too wide to straddle with the included mini ties. You can make 2 runs side-by side of course using one ring each, but it still seemed like an awkward design decision. The rear panel is flat, so there's no extra room for slop with your cables.No SATA cables included. Plenty of screws included. A cable to bridge RGB is there... even though it has a built in RGB hub... but there's no cable to splice the pwm fans.The HDD shroud is back farther than it needs to be. We had to remove it to fit a standard power supply.Thumb screws are a plus.A solid budget case, in my opinion. Does it's job with minimal thought. I'd be ticked off if I had an HDD to go in there though.",

Its powered by SATA and can be software controlled by plugging into your motherboard.Cons: While there are plenty of tie downs, cable management between the PSU and drive bays is going to require some effort. A USB c would have been nice on the top panel as I had to get a USB 3.0 to C cable for my VRLovely aesthetic case shows off the rgb fans as well as my AIO rgb. Great value for the money. Quite pleased",

                "reviewText": "I bought this on sale and for the price, I expected it to be of mediocre quality however I was pleasantly surprised how well made this case was. Case is on the smaller spectrum of ATX mid tower which is good, and a little wider in order to fit 140mm fans/radiator. It was easy to work in with decent amount of space and wire cut holes in all the right places for easy cable routing to bottom of the motherboard and top and sides where PSU and PCIe plugs would connect to the components. Front panel is easy to take off and didn't feel like I was going to break something.Wire management is easy, however wish the side panel had a bulge, it is flush so side wires cannot be too bulky otherwise you will struggle putting on the side panel. Front fan panel brackets are a little flimsy feeling but not enough for concern. Front panel only has USB 3, not USB 2 or USB-C or single headphone capability (it uses separate mic/headphone plugs), Airflow is excellent - I have a I5-12600K and an RTX 2070, enermax 240mm AIO CPU cooler. Ran Prime95 and Unigine heaven overnight and case kept things cool given the load (max cpu temp 79c / GPU 74c).I installed some cheap RGB fans in the front and rear and the setup looks like a million dollars. The glass panel on the side certainly makes it look elegant. I would buy this case again, especially if doing an RGB setup, oh and I would also feel comfortable overclocking in this case.",

Airflow is well thought out, and the removable filters on the top and bottom will make cleaning out dust easier. The case is very sturdy, with very little flex even with all panels removed and no motherboard installed. The bottom PSU cover is not removable, so all cable management will need to be done from behind the motherboard. The PCI covers are punch-out type instead of screw in, but that's to be expected in a budget case like this. Overall, the design and construction is excellent.",
