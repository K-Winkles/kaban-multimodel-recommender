                "reviewText": "Really nice case for a budget price. I got it because I\u2019ve had my gaming pc for like 5 years and it was just old, dirty, and outdated, and I wanted a refresh The only thing is the hard drive storage was a weird fit but I still got it in fine. Everything else is perfect the airflow is really nice, everything fit inside fine, the cable management was easy. The fans are all plugged into one along the back for easy power supply connection. And the power button connecters for the case are pin ports. On my old one the power button had a seta connecter. But overall super nice case for the 80 especially for a first build case, or a refresher case. Super happy I ended up getting it and loves the way it looks if you\u2019re debating it, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be happy with it also. One more thing also if you want to refresh your computer that\u2019s pretty old and dirty like mine I\u2019d recommended getting thermal paste. When I got everything swapped over and turned it on, it ran for a min but then turned off every time from cpu heat. My old thermal paste wasn\u2019t really effective anymore from me taking the cooler off of it from swapping cases. So if it\u2019s old I\u2019d also order that and refresh it. Just saving you time and stress Thanks for reading",

                "reviewText": "This case is very well built and looks really cool once it's all together. Even with both side panels off this thing didn't really show any flexion. There's plenty of space, the smoked glass isn't too dark like you often find, the fan lights really brighten up the inside. There are some screws and extra case standoffs, hdd slide storage brackets and the short manual which could be usefull regarding the fans. All materials are quality and free from defect on arrival.The only gripe I have is the fan wiring. Each fan has three wires on it, the power connectors are Molex pigtails so you wind up with a five deep Molex pigtail. Thankfully there's plenty of room in the cabling gap to store it. The wires were a jumbled, tangled, messy disaster on arrival. It's best to disconnect it all and untangle it, then have a look at the manual if you need to. It's pretty well written. There's three wires that you won't even use. The wire that signals the lighting change has two connectors, each wire has to connect to the next and the next, and the next to connect all fans together for mode swtiching. This creates neat little net design that makes out-of-sight cabling...interesting.I'm not sure who manufactured these fans but it could be so much better with proper wiring, given that they're quiet and bright. Aside from the wiring, I was even impressed with the fans.",

The motherboard I got didnt exactly fit in it and I had to VERY GENTLY move it around and hope and pray it didnt break as I bent it slightly to get the screws to fit into the slots on the pc, and it cannot hold a full size graphics card, but it is good and nice overall.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This was my first PC build, and I wanted to choose a case that was more subtle since the wife will also be dealing with this PC. It's listed as a Mid case, but if you have a standard ATX like I do, space is very tight. I had to front mount my AIO, as the Mobo was completely in the way when trying to top mount it. If I add another radiator to my build I would have to buy a new case. That being said, it does comfortably house a lot of fans. 3 in front, 2 top 1 rear. With the HDD cage removed I could throw one or two more in the bottom. I ended up taking out all the fans it came with and installing some name brand fans that I can use with Aura Sync. The cables it came with were sufficient which is all you can ask for. As a first-timer, I found cable management in this case to be very easy. The glass wall is nice.Overall this is a great case, especially for my first, and it checks all right boxes. I'm knocking off one star because internal space is tighter than advertised, the metal is overall pretty thin, and the pre-installed fans are controlled by a Sata powered block, thus not being able to control through the motherboard.",

Youtube videos on doing it are available. Comes with all the bits and pieces needed to install motherboard and PSU.Recommended and great value,",

                "reviewText": "I bought this case thinking I could get something with a pretty aesthetic for my new build. However, this thing turned out to be hot garbage. Here is a list:CONS:-The front panel is made of extremely cheap plastic. It could break very easily and is unfortunately very hard to remove if you need to service the pre-installed case fans.-The metal is so thin that it bends very easily under any pressure.-The hole that normally lets you have a cooler backplate for your motherboard is too small and basically not aligned for modern CPUs. I don't even know how this is allowed to be marketed as fine for ATX.-There was distinct lack of screws for all the parts someone may need.-The hard drive bay needs you to use the brackets the case comes with. However, mine came with 3 left and 1 right. I had to do some creative modding to get my second HDD to fit with two left brackets.-I was willing to pay a little extra to get a nice case in pink, and was even willing to put up with less quality than my old Phanteks case but at $180 CAD, this case is worth less than half that considering all the quality and design issues it has.-The hood for the PCIe slots is so cheap and doesn't really line up. It gets in the way more than it holds anything in place.-Regarding AIOs, I don't think this can fit a 360mm cooler. I managed to fit my 240mm AIO but the only way it fit was to remove the third fan from the front, even if my cooler only has two 120mm fans. Although I can respect the fact that my new cooler is fairly large (Arctic Freezer II), I have a hard time believing a 360mm cooler could fit in there. You will also run into other dimensions issues.-Do not plug in the HDD light header, the lights are too big and bright and they will just keep flashing all the time.-The dust filters do not have nice edges, and they WILL cut you if you're not careful.PROS:-Is Pink-The included fans are pretty quiet-The RGB on the fans is pretty",
