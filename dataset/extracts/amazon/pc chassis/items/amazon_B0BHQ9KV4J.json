                "reviewText": "This review is for the RackChoice 4U Rackmount Server Chassis with 6x 5.25+2x3.5 Drive Bays.Let\u2019s start out by calling a spade a spade this is an entry level/no frills rackmount case. While not specifically mentioned this really seems to be targeting the Home Lab/Small Business Crowd who knows what they\u2019re doing and trying to do it on a shoestring budget. It seems like as soon as anything becomes rackable in our industry the costs shoot up sky-high. This offering from RackChoice seems to fall into that more reasonable category for someone looking to build out a FreeNAS setup.What you get in the box:- The 4U Server Chassis is a full depth rack mountable case, with integrated handles on the ears. Already installed are 2x80mm fans (with 4pin molex connectors) as well as 2 USB ports in the front along with LED Power and HDD Lights, along with a reset and power switch. Along with a plastic motherboard mat to avoid electric contact with the unpainted case bottom.- 2xLocking Key for the front it comes locked so don\u2019t lose these! Thankfully the lock can be left unlocked, and you can manually turn the lock to at least \u201chold\u201d the doors which have integrated filters on them (more on that later)- All the mounting standoffs as well as screws for the motherboard- 2 PCI Slot Covers- 4xCable Tiedowns- CAD Drawings of the case dimensions and clearancesThe Good:- This is reasonably priced for the Home Lab- Rack Mounted- Powder Coating is even and great fit and finish, mostly steel casing except for the handles and some of the door parts- Flexible, I\u2019ve got a mATX board in here, but I\u2019d believe their claims of a full ATX board in here. The cross bar in the back is removable while working on the case. There are also predrilled holes for rails.The Left to Be Desired:Most of these are understandable concessions based on the price point they\u2019re trying to hit:- No cage nuts; I understand that most setups may already have these, but for the home lab setup these might be in short supply, the cost to add the 12 nuts probably would have been negligible.- No rails; again, this is a more premium feature, in fact many home labs won\u2019t have rack that even support rails. On the plus side these holes are pre-drilled and ready for someone who is ready to go.- The Filters on the front are very wonky in my opinion. I can\u2019t figure out how to remove them, but it\u2019ll be awhile before I have to worry about that. My work around will probably be just to use compressed air and blow though them as they\u2019re hooked up.This case has 6x5.25 Drive Bays, it\u2019d be a great build for someone who was looking to build a rack mounted rip station. However, for my purposes I intend to replace these with 3.5\u201d Drive Bay adapters to build out a FreeNAS box. The advertising for this shows a slick hot swap cage. However, it does not appear that RackChoice currently sells this cage. Instead, after a significant amount of searching I was able to find a usable `5.25\" to 4x 3.5\" SATA SAS Hard Drive HDD Cage Rack Tray Caddy CD-ROM Bay Slot` that was reasonably priced and met my requirements.The fans aren\u2019t much to write home about, most are probably going to be replaced with like Noctua\u2019s in the home setting and for a business the rack room is loud anyway!There is absolutely no documentation beyond the drawings; but at this level you\u2019re expected to know what you\u2019re doing and how to properly place standoffs in the right places.The PCI Slots are still machined in there as you would expect from a budget case, simply use your screwdriver to pry them out, but be careful not to bend the adjacent slot.",

                "reviewText": "This is a \"Plain Jane\" Server Case at a reasonable price point. I didn't expect too much at this price point, but the case is a bit better and HEAVIER than I had anticipated. At this price I'd buy another if needed. I definitely recommend this 4U Rackmount Server Case.",
