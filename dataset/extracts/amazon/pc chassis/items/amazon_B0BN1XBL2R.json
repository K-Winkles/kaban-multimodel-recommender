With higher quality fans, it runs quietly and met the need as a laboratory based server for running precision fiber optic microscopes and other Windows-based tools.The chassis is made of decent quality and can adapt easily to whatever custom need you have. Makes for a great media, industrial, or general purpose server. You have room for several SSDs and low profile expansion cards. I'll definitely buy again for future projects.",

                "reviewText": "Case arrived packed well and included a variety of screws, one 2.5\" drive adapter and all the basics described and pictured. The four internal drive bays are a good idea, but in a case this short I don't believe you could mount four 3.5\" drives without interfering with the board. I have one 3.5\" drive mounted high and a 2.5\" SSD low, so four 2.5\" drives may work.My purpose was transferring a desktop PC to a 2U rackmount and this case fit my needs perfectly. I feel this is a solid rack mount case and a good value for anyone in the market for a 2U case to transfer to or build a new machine in. I would buy another if I needed one.",

                "reviewText": "Very usable in short racks and sturdy. If this will be used in a location where people are working, then the included 8 cm fans should be replaced with quieter, PWM fans that plug directly into the motherboard. Cramped space can be expected with any 2U case, but note that:1) Only the top slot of each 3.5 drive case is usable with micro-ATX motherboards.2) A hard drive in the left-most 3.5 drive case will barely clear stock CPU fans on micro-ATX motherboards and will require right-angle SATA data and power cables. A large CPU cooler would not be possible with a micro-ATX motherboard.3) A SFX power supply and ATX adapter plate will be needed for most hot swap cages that can be used in the 2x5.25 drive bay. IMHO, SFX PSUs are essentially required for short rack cases.",

                "reviewText": "If you are looking for one of the smallest 2U form factor cases for rack mounting. This is probably one of the best you can get for the price (~$100 at time of writing).Understand that it does come with 4 slots to fit 3.5\" hard drives, but if you are running mATX, there is really only room for 2 at the highest point or you run into space issues. Don't expect to run 3 or 4 hard drives in here with mATX. If you use mini-iTX, you will have no issues filling all 4 slots.It is a 15\" depth 2U form-factor, so the build space is very limited, but you will get the same experience in any case with that depth. Very precise cable mounting is necessary with this case, so if you are not ready to struggle a bit to route cabling in the case (especially with mATX), then you may want to go for a 17\" depth or more.",

                "reviewText": "The chassis exhibits robust and durable construction. The included fans, equipped with molex connectors, are deemed satisfactory; however, should be updated for the price. The case features multiple sharp corners and panels, a characteristic often associated with budget-friendly cases. Despite these considerations, the overall assessment is positive, and I would make the purchase again. It's worth noting that accommodating four drives with a micro ATX configuration is impeded by the proximity of the 24-pin motherboard connection to the drive bays. Alternatively, a mini ATX board may allow for additional drive compatibility.",

I was unlucky and had an issue with one of the USB port on the front IO panel however, upon seeing my review the vendor contacted me and offered to send a replacement. Vendor support was very good and very receptive to feedback. Very good experience so far.My only critique would be that the USB 3 cable for the front IO is a little stiff.Update : I received the new Front Panel IO and it is now functional. Very good communication with the vendor. Thank you!",

The handles are solid and fits well in a standard rack.The first change I made was replaced the two 80mm fans with Noctua ones, it made a huge difference. Also the power LED is extremely bright - you cannot look directly at it. I put a 5.1k resistor on that wire to reduce the brightness.",
