The stock fans are a little noisy, but can be replaced with Noctuas. Plenty of drive spaces. Using this case for my Plex server. This particular case allows the power supply to be mounted upsidedown, this is helpful with using a PS with a top mounted fan. When this unit has other servers stacked, the vent on top will be blocked. There is about an inch and a half of space underneath for the PS fan to get plenty of air (plus adds cooling for the 2 SSDs mounted there also). Very happy, immediately bought a second.",

                "reviewText": "There's a lot to like about this case - it's an efficient layout for micro-ATX boards, and it's compatible with both ATX and micro-ATX PSUs. It has relatively shallow depth for a rack case, which is great for a homelab. The 2x 5.25\" bays leave you with a lot of options--I use mine as a NAS, and it accommodates 8x 2.5\" SSDs in a hot-swappable configuration.The build quality is solid - when unmounted the case does have a bit of wobble along the diagonal, but as soon as it's mounted, it's extremely sturdy. Cooling is okay although the 80mm stock fan started rattling after a few months. At that point I ordered a couple of Noctua's, and that's where the frustration set in. To install new front intake fans, you have to disassemble the whole case, since the fans are mounted from behind the pre-installed dust filter. A truly unfortunate design choice.",

                "reviewText": "It's a basic box that permits generic computers builds. You could do a 120mm AIO for an IGPU and space for less wide pcie cards. 30 & 40 series GPUs will not fit. A number of sound cards will not fit. So on the home server market I don't know who this case is for. But if you need a server but don't need much processing power nor the best audio or video without having other components separate from the computer like 2U 32 channel EQ, I don't get this case. And working with one 120mm and one 80mm fan slot is odd when they both could have been 120mm. In combination with the 5 inch drive slots I could have seen Engineers and graphics artists easily using the case. And there's only 4 ssd mounts without the 5\" drive bays included. So you'll run out of space quickly unless you have 20ish TB SSD.",

It can mount an ATX power supply, so long as you don't want to plug anything into your motherboard on the bottom edge. It supports full size PCIe cards, but the top lid isn't going on if it has a supplementi power plug. It has two 2.5\" SSD mounts under the power supply, but if you want to say plug cables into those drives, forget it.My unit has one standoff that is lower than the others, so if you put a screw into it, all the I/O ports shift out of alignment with the shield.In short, don't buy this planning on bringing over the bare minimum of parts that you'd fit in a desktop case.",

                "reviewText": "This case comes with a standard 120mm case fan and an 80mm case fan on the front, and 4x PCIe slots, and 2x 5.25 inch and 1x 3.5 inch external drive bays, for plenty of expansion space for audio card, gpu (small to medium physical size ones only), cd/dvd/Blu-ray drives, etc.In addition to 2x 2.5 inch SSD slots under the atx power supply, there are 8 slots for HDDs stacked directly behind the fans, but the smaller fan and front panel controllers are running through two of them, by default. You can remove either of the 4-drive bays to route cables around it and make space, but you need a long screwdriver to access those screws. So it is possible to add up to 8x HDDs, or potentially many sata SSDs.You will not be able to fit any gpu over about 180mm, if using the hdd slots directly in across from the pci slots, or about 250-260mm with those hdd bays empty. If you are really stubborn and determined, you could remove those 4 drive bays and fit up to about 330mm gpu, but that just begs the question: why? \ud83d\ude05 if you need one of those high powered GPUs, the cooling in this case will most likely be horrendous, unless you\u2019re planning to Frankenstein your way through it, and/or use external cooling. But a \u201cregular\u201d gpu should be fine.Overall: it\u2019s a great 3u case for a small business server, home lab, pc tower to rackmount conversion, etc. It has everything you should need for most normal use-cases.",

                "reviewText": "Using this for a full atx build that will be mounted under the left side of a standing desk. Initially, I am using an older 970 to drive a display since it's the only GPU I have that fits the height requirement. If you plan on using a gaming GPU, then I'd recommend having the PSU connectors on the back (closest to the front of the case) or short enough that you can get 180-degree adapters. GPUs that have overhangs will also not fit due to the 3u requirement.The quality of the case is pretty high, I haven't found any sharp edges or any indication of a cheaper case. The included fans are adequate for a server environment but are quite loud for me and replaced them with PWM fans on the intake. Temperatures have been fine, in the picture I am running the AM4 Athlon 200GE but have since replaced it with a 5600x, and stock cooler, without any issues.I need a case that could hold a 5.25 drive bay for a BluRay reader as well as be out of sight - this has worked well enough and has been great for working at my desk.",
