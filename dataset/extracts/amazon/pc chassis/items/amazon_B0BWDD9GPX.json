This case moonlights under a lot of names so finding information is a little challenging but other than that it's a 5 star buy.My only real complaint is the pcie 3.0 riser, not that it really effects performance.If you're interested in what's inside my case:Gigabyte b760i aorus proIntel i5 13600k (thermal wright contact frame used)Thermal wright axp120x67Powercolor Hellhound 7900xtxCorsair sfx 750w platinumSamsung 980 2tb32gb Corsair vengeance 6000 cl30This is a little gaming monster, used primarily for 4k gaming (high refresh esports stuff ) and atmosphere rich single player stuff (starfield, bg3 etc). Happy with the performance and the temps.The noise levels are minimal with some fan curves, and the front USB port and USB c ports are handy (though I removed both for better airflow for the GPU).Overall I'd highly recommend this case.If you want to get a pcie 4.0 riser I went with Linkup. The 20cm dual reverse riser is a little longer than needed and the 18cm is a little too short. 19cm is the size you want.",

Reviews and a couple of videos I saw on the case never mentioned it did not include screws. The page, single leaflet instruction manual all mention the existance of 16 screws I am missing. I don't want to waste my time sending it back and getting a new one and I was not able to contact the seller directly. The bottom fixtures for a fan requires a slim profile 90mm if you want it to fit in the psu spaghetti.Edit: the manufacturer doesn't know how to lable products. For anyone who runs into lag issues during or after OS installation, the pcie cable is gen 3 however it will read automatically as gen 4. You have to go into bios and manually set it to gen 3.",

This can have 2 fans on the top which is what they should've done with the S300 because it's all back to a nice 30-35 degrees which is what it should be when idle and I can feel the fans blowing the air out from top.If you're looking at the S300 and then just noticed this, definitely consider this one just because that slight extra space allows for better airflow! Something PC users that game a lot would benefit from!",

                "reviewText": "My first ITX build and it went pretty smoothly with this case. It comes with a Gen 3 PCI-e riser, so be sure to configure that in your BIOS to set it to Gen 3 instead of Auto/Gen 4. You can only fit a a lot profile air cooler so pay attention to that as well. No regular size air coolers or liquid coolers. Installed a 120mm x 25mm case fan on the front part of the top panel. Wanted to do the same to the back part of the top panel but the clearance height is a lot smaller so you'll need to use a 120mm x 15mm case fan instead. Diagram says there's room for a case fan at the bottom as well but honestly I don't think that's possible as you'll need that space for the cables. But otherwise it's a great case that's smaller than the size of a shoebox. Top handle is nice but I don't think I'll be using that only when carrying the unit around - will put it into a bag or support the bottom.",
