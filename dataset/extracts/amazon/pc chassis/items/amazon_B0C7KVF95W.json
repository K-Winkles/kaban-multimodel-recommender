                "reviewText": "So I game a few hours every day and it was time to upgrade my pc and I went with an ATX motherboard instead of my micro ATX board so I needed a new case to make the fit. There are a lot of a different cases out there for all kinds of prices but this one is a solid budget choice. The case is super solid, it looks great, and it comes with 4 fans. You really can\u2019t beat that. All fans and lights were in working order. Running the wires was easy enough maybe some changes there could make it easier but over all this case is fantastic. Solid 10/10",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ll start by saying that I am a fan of the micro ATX form factor in general. I think it's the most utilitarian form factor in production and it's sad that it's so ignored. When most PC's now are a motherboard, an attached SSD, a graphics card and a heat-sink, I don't know why people are still buying gigantic desk monsters. ITX is very efficient and elegant is also expensive and limiting. A four terabyte 3.5\u201d drive can be had for $50 these days. A 4tb SSD still clocks in close to $400. Until that changes, a 3.5\u201d drive bay is still a must IMHO. This case is a great size. The depth is a little lower than a lot of matx cases so you can\u2019t fit a long GPU in here (240mm is probably the max\u2026) but most folks building with this aren\u2019t going to be putting a 3090 in it anyway. You will probably want to stick with a shorter PSU as well. This case was easy to work in. It has all the access you would typically find in a modern case. Honestly, my biggest gripe is that it should include a rear fan to match the front ones. The RGB/Fan controller has a port for a third one but it\u2019s proprietary and I could not find one anywhere. Just charge another $5 and include the rear fan. PWM control would be nice as well\u2026Pros:Great space saving case without being too small.Cable management is surprisingly goodThe case feels well put together and not cheaply madeThe front panel pops off easily for access to the fans.Cons:Depth is lower then many MATX cases. PSU and GPU sizes will be limitedNo rear fanNo PWM controlFans aren\u2019t loud, but they aren\u2019t quiet either",

The tempered glass is going to make the rgb look real nice when I'm finally finished. All the cables are neatly bundled in the metal side of the case with the connectors easily accessible to run to the connections whenever they arrive. I just wish there was a way to contact the seller so I could find out what rgb adapter I need since my motherboard is a 4 pin. Also nothing came damaged, dinted or scratched. The only bad thing I can say is that it was sent in just the main box. I live in a apartment complex and anyone who happened to walk by could see what it was.**Edit**I found the way to communicate with the seller and I was given quick responses with multiple ways and product suggestions on how to address my problem with the rgb fans to make them work with my motherboard.
