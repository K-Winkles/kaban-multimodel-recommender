                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Case and With Minor Flaws and HORRIBLE Instructions",
                "reviewText": "This case is a very well thought out design, with some minor flaws. I primarily bought this case as I wanted a new AIO now, but want to go custom loop later when I build a new system. This case seemed perfect for my current needs.PROS:- Great build quality: The entire case and glass is very well packaged to protect everything, and I didn't have a single flaw in my case. No scratched paint, dented sides, blemishes, bad threads, or anything like this.- Great cooling: I was worried that not having airflow across my motherboard VRMs would become a problem, but my temps have dropped a bit from my last case with a Cooler Master T4 Heatsink with Noctua NF-F12 120MM Fan that was paired with 4 120MM Rosewill case fans. Those four Rosewill fans are not longer used, so the heat just rises out with my setup. Mind you I am currently only cooling a 7700k at 4.5 GHz and a GTX 1080, but are not overclocked.- Design. Standing up this case looks great, but you could easily take off the side panel and metal rod mounts and set the case on its back and use it as a test bench. You can also mount it on a wall or to a desk with a VESA mount, but considering how heavy a full build is, I would never try it.- Glass: The smoked tempered glass is perfect. Acrylic is too cheesy for such a nice a build.- PCI-E Riser Cable: It works flawlessly with my GIGABYTE GTX 1080 WindForce 3X OC. I was no difference in 3DMark scores with it installed directly to the PCI-E slot or using the riser cable, so it appears I got a newer cable or got very lucky, as they are known to be a huge problem online.CONS:The Thermaltake website and spec sheets list full 420MM radiator support. While my Arctic Freezer II 420 mounted fine, the radiator cannot be mounted perfect. There is a support piece in the upper right front of the case that slightly blocks the top right radiator screw just enough that it forces you to drop the entire radiator down slightly. Once I got to the bottom I could not thread in the bottom two screws for my radiator as the holes didn't line up. They are correct on the case, but because the radiator had to be shifted down slightly it won't line up. I also had one screw right behind a USB 3.0 front header that I couldn't mount because the cable was perfectly in the way. I have 9 out of 12 screws mounted though, so I have no fear of the radiator coming off or sliding around.- Cable management: This case has so much room in the pack I was able to fit 2x 3.5\" HDDs in the mount and randomly stuff 3x 2.5\" SSDs in to the back with room to spare.- Pointless dust filter: If you use this thing for water, the dust filter in the back of the case becomes 100% useless. It would only protect the cable management area where drives are mounted anyways in an air setup, and that is with the flow backwards from looks the best.- Instructions: My god are the instructions useless. The diagrams are horrible and don't explain anything. They are useful for checking you got all your necessary hardware as it has a parts list, but beyond that they were more harm than good. I STRONLY suggest you watch multiple YouTube videos for the install, as I watched over 5 and not a single one got everything right. Watching those, along with the following tips will greatly help.ASSEMBLY TIPS1.) If your motherboard has a CPU power connector up on the top of the board like most you need to remove the bottom HDD mount bracket from inside the case to run the cable behind it for better cable management. There are 4 screws for this on the motherboard side of the case. You don't need to remove the motherboard for this, there are two each side and that panel removes. I ran the cable underneath this bracket and reinstalled it. You can also do this without removing the bracket BEFORE you install your motherboard.2.) If mounting GPU vertically, make sure you don't mount the power supply sideways, there are two PSU brackets included in the kit. You can install the PSU with the fan facing towards the glass, but only with a Micro-ATX board and no vertical mounting. The case has hardware to do it both ways.3.) Make sure to attach the small support post to the power supply bracket BEFORE you install a power supply if you are going to install your GPU vertically with the riser cable. The power supply will block you from making this install. Use the flat screw designed to go into the recess on the PSU bracket so it mounts flat to your PSU.4.) Be very careful with the threads. The case is very thick, but case steel tends to be very soft. Some of the powder coat is in the threads, so if you feel any resistance at all, back your screw out and check them. I ended up just slowly backing the screws out and back in a few times when I had this issue, and it only happened 2-3 times across the entire build.5.) Carefully go through the hardware. There were 4 rubber plugs and washers that I thought were supposed to be anti-vibration mounts for a custom water pump, but they are actually rubber bushings and washers for the tempered glass panel. The plugs go into the glass to protect it, and the washers go on the thumb mounts for the glass. Totally protects the glass from any damage or vibration. Also make sure you are using the right screws for the right threads -- the manual is actual nice for this on the inside front pages, it lists how many of each screws or parts there should be -- but more importantly it lists exactly what it should be used for. You don't want to strip out a thread on this nice case.This case is my favorite I have ever had, and it is probably close to my 20th or so. I don't see myself needing a new case for a long time, and if I ever did change to a new one for any reason, this case would make a very good test bench, or maybe even a good closet wall mounted media server!",

                "reviewText": "***UPDATED REVIEW***Okay so I originally gave this case a two star review, but now updating it to a 5 star. Original issue I had with the case was that the PCIE bracket does not hold a PCIE 4 cable, only the pcie 3 cable that came with the case. I reached out to their support, and got a message almost instantly. The issue I had was that I was using a PCIE 4 with a 90 degree angle. They pointed out that I need a normal pcie with no angle, and should fit. Haven't ordered the new cable yet, but thought the case deserves an updated review due to the stellar customer service from TT, and the case is very pleasant, and appears to be of good quality (the cable was the only irratant for me). I will update again if I have any further issues with the new cable I am going to order.Previous review:I really really want to like this case. Quality is good, and case looks really good. By and large, everything went together smoothly with no issues, until I got to the pcie riser cable for my GPU. Here is the problem, the case came with a pcie 3 riser cable but I wanted to use a pcie 4 cable instead. Ordered two sets of pcie 4 cables and both will not fit on the included pcie bracket. Holes don\u2019t match up. First cable I ordered was by linkup and wouldn\u2019t work. Then I returned it and order a thermaltake pcie 4 riser cable thinking it should work (you would think) on their cases, but nope same issue. Pcie 4 cable holes will not match up. The original pcie 3 cable that came with the case works perfectly, but what about the people that want to use pcie 4 or even 5 in the future for future proofing? Seems really dump that they can\u2019t provide a bracket that supports pcie 4. This is a big deal for me. I will try to get a hold of the manufacture tomorrow to see if they have a workaround, and I will revise my review when I hear from them.",

                "reviewText": "Great case. I finally went with an open air case and I'm not disappointed.Construction quality and aesthetic are phenomenal (I bought the black version). Currently mounting this to the wall next to my desk with a single-stud TV mount (It's an Amazon Basics item, cost about $30, model number 7851B). The wall mount look is as good as expected, and the TV arm is plenty strong enough to hold this case. Fastened very securely, and I moved it a few times to reassure myself it wouldn't break or fall off the wall.Good: case quality and looks are great. Airflow and spacing is great. Cable management was easy, and mounting the GPU horizontally let me keep a minimal look. Thrilled with how this build is coming along.Cons: there isn't many places for fans, so if you want to run a large radiator for cooling one component you limit what you can do to cool another component. I'm using a large radiator for the CPU and will stick with stock cooling on the GPU. Not a huge con, but know that you can't put multiple radiators on here.Also, I'm not using any of the 2.5/3.5 drive bays, but there are more than I expected with five in total. Placement of some of the drives might be less than ideal though, with three of the slots completely blocking where the radiator will be mounted. That's a serious choice to make if you wanted to shove a bunch of drives on this. Not worth complaining though, I knew before I bought it that I was going full NVME.Finally, putting the feet on is a pain in the butt until you get the first screw in place. It's not you, it's just super irritating. The other 3 screws for each foot are easy though, and I'll be taking the feet off once this is permanently wall mounted.Strongly recommend this case for an unusual, minimal look that showcases the components.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this case with the main goal of wall-mounting my PC and having it not look like a messy black box strapped to my wall. It worked out perfectly in this regards. Somewhere I read that it doesn't come with the wall-mount bracket, and that worried me but all they mean is you need the same VESA mounting bracket you would buy for mounting monitors and TVs to the wall, you don't need anything specific to this case. Just make sure you use one that can support the weight.It took at least twice as long to assemble this case and mount my components than with a regular case, but it is easier and less frustrating than the same process using a traditional case (because my fat fingers don't have to stick in places where they're likely to drop screws). The case is more rigid than I anticipated and roughly on par with my previous cases.I haven't mounted any traditional drives as this PC is entirely NVMe, but there are a few brackets that would work for this if you want. You can print brackets for mounting optical discs, if you want to, but overall this case looks fantastic with minimal components so I wouldn't consider permanently attaching any drives to this PC.You will probably want a modular power supply with this case so you don't end up with extra cables dangling and unused (they can be tucked away out-of-sight, so it wouldn't be terrible).I mounted my GPUs using the traditional layout instead of mounting them vertically using the included bracket. If I wanted to mount them vertically I would have had to purchase an additional PCIe extension cable as they only include enough to mount a single card. I prefer the traditional look but I'm also told I'm an old fogey.This might be a negative: There are very few options for mounting case fans as the case is designed primarily around a water cooling system, but they provide an index of brackets you can order from online 3D printers so it takes extra time to get the case and figure out what will work for you and then wait for the prints to show up but you end up with what you actually want.",
