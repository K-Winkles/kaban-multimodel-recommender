                "reviewText": "This is a great mid size PC case that can handle micro ATX boards. It has 5 slots in the back which is more than most micro atx cases and perfect for 3 intake and 3 exhaust fans. Fits GPU up to 340mm and maybe a few mm past that. Plenty of room to build in and attach cables and awesome cable routing space in the back so you don\u2019t have to worry too much about being tidy. I really like the tempered glass side panel that won\u2019t scratch easily and shows everything clearly. The magnets are great too, super easy to open and close and remove. Highly recommend this case for your next white build and anything from super high end to mid or lower tier builds.",

The white color is sleek and modern, and the fact that it also comes in pink, black, and green mint is a great bonus as it allows me to choose the color that best fits my personal style.The Micro ATX and Mini ITX compatibility is perfect for my build, and the included 120mm ARGB fan adds some extra flair to my setup. The tempered glass side panel and front mesh panel are both high-quality and add to the overall aesthetic of the case. The door opening feature is also a convenient touch, making it easy to access the inside of my computer.Installation was very straightforward and the case is overall very easy to work with. The compact size is also a plus, as it allows me to easily fit it into any setup.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Vetroo M03 Compact Computer Case. It is a high-quality product that has exceeded my expectations in terms of both function and aesthetics. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in need of a compact computer case. Five stars!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this case strictly for the very minimal look that it has to fit my home office aesthetic not knowing how easy it would be to build in. There are a few small features that weren't so hot but overall still worth 5 stars per the price.Pros:1. Great size. Not many Micro-ATX cases anymore these days and this one is a perfect balance of classic tower looks without being so huge.2. Cable management is a breeze. The included cable brackets in the back fit the motherboard cable from the PSU. There also plenty of cable tie spots all throughout the back which is nice for tidying things up.3. I think the case just looks great. There also aren't many cases that take advantage of a 200mm fan and it was nice to see in this case.Cons:1. The front RGB fan was molex...no control of the RGB out of the box. Easy fix though, I purchased another branded 200mm fan for $20.2. No USB-C included in the front I/O. Definitely a big bummer. I believe every case in 2022 should have at least one. I even purchased a PCIe USB-C card. If you look in my pictures though, the graphics card is too thick that it didn't fit with the graphics card also plugged in.If you can get over the 2 cons I shared above, the case is great and well worth the small $80 it costs to purchase. The tempered glass panel show all your components nicely and the case is clean and minimal.",

We decided this case would be the best overall, a $60 case with USB-C isn't common, and the magnetic side panel is actually a lot nicer than I initially thought. My only gripe is that the expansion brackets in the back have to be broken off to place a PCIe card in the PC. You could just buy replaceable ones (5-pack go for like $7), but kind of sucks the ones that come with this case aren't replaceable. We don't have all of the parts yet, but I will update this review with pictures when it's completed.",

But anyway, this is a great budget case. Really easy to build in, lots of thoughtful little features (like all the holes in the metal chassis being rolled, removable hard drive bay, pads for the PSU to rest on, vertical GPU mounting option, etc). Only complaints are that the metal it's made of is a little thin, but it's a pretty cheap case so really can't fault it for that. Second is that the fan it comes with is molex with no way to control speed or colour. This didn't matter to me because I changed the front fan anyway but be aware of that if you plan to use it. Overall a really solid product for a really reasonable price. Looks really nice in the pink too.",

                "reviewText": "One mild disappointment is that after I installed my arctic freezer II 240 aio the top dust filter no longer lay flush against the case because of the larger screws, but this is a very specific problem so I don't expect anyone else to have it.I had trouble sliding the power supply in because of the tight opening on the side, but after 1 minute of fiddling it fit in alright and is raised perfectly by the rubber supports underneath.I also appreciate that the logo isn't slapped on the front of the case which makes it look more clean and pleasant.I absolutely recommend this case for micro atx builds but while you plan your build check the diagram provided with the measurements of the case and the mounting supports needed.Thank you Vetroo",

Case, motherboard, GPU, cables... everything black, it makes it difficult to see the components, so I decided to buy a white case. This case is perfect for me. The size is just right, the side door makes it easy to work with, and it looks beautiful on my desk.The only negative thing I can find is that the door hinges are quite thin, so if you remove the door, it can be a bit difficult to put it back, but that's it.",
