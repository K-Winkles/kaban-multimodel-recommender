                "reviewText": "This is a modern industrial/workstation/gamer/dvr/daw 4U case. You will not be disappointed. I bought two. It's a perfect blend of old school and new school design. For example, it has two 5.25 drive bays and supports 280 mm coolers (and unofficially 360 mm if removing the 5.25 drive bays). Attached to the 5.25 drive bays, you can mount two 2.5 inch drives. It has up to three com port knock outs. I always appreciate at least one. You can easily route/modify this particular area to attach other peripheral connectors, in my case, the daughter card to the RME RayDAT card. You can use a dremel for this. Make sure you vacuum the case very well to remove any metal shavings. My next modification will be to route the full area above the pcie slots to hang up to two more daughter cards. The case is on the lighter-weight side, but sturdy, BTW. One other note: it appears the entire back panel can be removed if you unscrew it. Though I didn't try this.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this in use for a few months now. If you don't have an extreme setup or anything, this will do nicely.My older editing rig that I wanted to test this case out with is listed below. I wasn't sure how this was going to work -- would the airflow be good? Would everything fit? How noisy would a 'basic' server case be (clanking, rattling, etc)?So far, I'm very pleasantly surprised at how simple this change over was. Reading the comments, it made it seem like it would be more trial and error, which I didn't experience anything other than a straight forward drop in.With the rack in my closet, I never realized how quiet my computer room could have been many years prior to this. Wish I did this a long time ago. Way more expensive than going a simple desktop case but well worth it.When editing or gaming in this case, my temps are not any worse than with my high flow desktop cube case I had (Corsair 540). I typically stay ~55-58c during video rendering and during gaming the gpu is ~60c with a mild fan curve. Even in the closet, the stock fan curve was louder than I wanted but kept temps down in the low 50's. So I figured the trade-off of >10c for much quieter sound was worth it.So if you're worried about this case not having all the fans you've become accustomed to with gaming cases, don't fret. A good AIO cooler (the Arctic II is excellent and fits great in this case!) and two Noctua 80mm fans on the rear keep the flow decent with minimal sound.Componentsi7 6850k (oc'd to 4ghz)x99 Titanium ATX moboR9 Fury4 x SSD'sArctic II 240 CoolerI ended up not using the gpu bracket or hdd cage. I just stuffed my 4 ssd's in the area for 5.25 devices since I'll never use that for anything.Cable management is easy but not as much of a requirement for something that will be tucked away. Sure, you still want it clean and easy to work on as well as keeping the restriction of airflow down, with that in mind, it's nothing to get the cables out of the way.The case is solid and sturdy. When put in the rack with the lid, no rattles from the case whatsoever. With the front lockable door open or closed, it made no difference in my temps, so I just keep it closed.Love the usb-c port on the front!Mild cons:It's pricey.Can't find good quality sliding rails to work with it.Will be moving my other 2 computers into these cases over time.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this as my first rackmount chassis and thus far it has not disappointed. With a 5950x with PBO enabled and an Arctic Freezer II 240 AIO that I replaced the stock fans on with Noctua industrial 2000rpm fans, my peak temperature is about 74C with the fans at ~75% (PBO Enabled with 200mhz over stock boost speed allowed, Gigabyte X570 Aorus Master. Max temp was 55Cish at stock settings) Even though it is a rackmount chassis, I admire Silverstone for providing the adaptability to a vertical tower and for also including USB3 and USB-C ports on the front since every other chassis I looked at only has basic USB2.I noticed a tiny little bit of flex in the chassis with the top PCIE stabilizer bracket removed when applying a little bit of torque to the front handles. However, since I have no height constraints with my GPU (Just a 1050ti, this machine is just meant for running several clustered Ark: Survival servers) I put it back in just for structural stability. It's not like torque would be applied to it under normal circumstances anyways so this isn't a huge concern. The stock fans it came with were from \"BeCool,\" and I could not find any information on them even with a part number. The website on the fans themselves also seems to be dead. They are labeled as drawing .51A and .53A respectively (Rear 80mm and front 120mm) which means there would be a potential risk for frying fan headers if you doubled up either of these fans in series since most fan headers are only rated for 1A.I think I made the right choice for my first venture into rackmounting and I shall update this review if it turns out my choice was wrong!",

                "reviewText": "Overall it's very underwhelming for the price. The vertical oriented hardware is cheap feeling. I thought it might be a feature I'd use but the hardware is not confidence instilling and once it's rack mounted you'll probably never use it. Not a lot of space for SSDs unless you convert bays. Its a pretty solid unit but there are comparable cases for half the price.",

Every single connector is labeled with polarity, and EVERY screw is separated into individual baggies, and every baggies is labeled for the exact purpose. My only complaint would be for a higher quality HDD Front Panel LED, and if the drive cage and front mesh cover retainers could be 2 separate fixtures (I don't need the cage, but the covers are nice, and require the cage to be installed) - Otherwise, Silverstone, you guys did a really good job.FYI, The ARCTIC COOLING Liquid Freezer II - 240 fits perfectly in the front.",

And especially for shorter depth racks (mine is roughly 18\"). I'm using a 2U inverted shelf as a stop gap until I can find something more suitable.Any way, going to be keeping this one a long time!",
