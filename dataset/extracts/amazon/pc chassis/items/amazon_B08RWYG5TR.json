Look at the product photo. That's all the instructions you need.If you don't own a screwdriver with a bit that'll fit the tiny hex screws then you probably don't need an atx test bench.When you install the mainboard, put the case and mainboard on its side and loosely insert the top middle screw. Then you support the mainboard from below with one hand as you slide the rails back and forth to align the screw standoffs. EasyThis is my first test bench and I had no problem.",

                "reviewText": "I'm an engineer by trade, and I've been working with computers of every variety for the past 20 years. I bought this open bracket chassis in the hopes of having a minimalist bench to test various old components I've collected over the years. I would not purchase this again, as it is a giant headache to assemble.After 2 hours of deciphering Chinese and frustration, this contraption technically works, which warrants 2 stars I suppose. I do not feel remotely safe attaching any computer components to it, as the motherboard itself is held onto the metal chassis by poorly fitted plastic bits that wiggle and flounce all over. This was one of the fiddliest, most annoyingly designed things I've worked with, and in order to get it together properly, I'd need to spend at least another 3-4 hours with it, including additional fabrication of parts that fit more properly together, and likely some glue. Maybe if I spoke Chinese I could make better sense of this, but alas, I do not.I will pass on the additional headache; I would have to entirely disassemble the thing again multiple times, and it's simply not worth it. Now I need to decide if I should bring it into work to recycle for scrap, or just throw the whole thing out.Learn from my mistakes, and spend your money elsewhere.",
