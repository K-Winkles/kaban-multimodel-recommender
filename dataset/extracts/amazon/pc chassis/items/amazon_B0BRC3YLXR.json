            "Dual Chamber Layout: Unlike traditional computer cases, the S580 employs a dual chamber layout. This provides ample space for your hardware, excellent airflow and ventilation, efficient cable management, and allows you to create a visually striking build. With the rear chamber dedicated to power supply, hard drives, and cables, the main chamber remains clear for fan and radiator mounting points, giving you an unobstructed view of your important components.",
            "Tempered Glass Panels: The S580 case features two 4mm tempered glass panels on the front and side, adding durability and a touch of elegance. These clear transparent windows are perfect for showcasing your ARGB LED lighting and the intricate construction of your internal components.",
            "Mesh Panels: Aesthetics meet performance with the S580's metal mesh panels. The top and right side panels are designed with 1mm diameter mesh, allowing for massive airflow potential and optimal cooling.",
            "Concentrated Airflow: The S580 is designed to maximize airflow and heat dissipation. It can accommodate up to 10 fans and supports a 360mm water cooler, ensuring your components stay cool even during intensive gaming sessions.",
            "Please Note: The fans and complements are not included! Warm tips: Please install the bottom fans first before installing the motherboard."

Tons of space for cable management, solid construction, the glass is sturdy and slides in and down to seat which i like better than my Lian Li which is rubber grommet snaps and a single screw to secure. surprisingly roomy inside, has a 280mm AIO, 6 fans and a large zotac 3070 and still doesnt look cramped at all. If id seen this case during my build id have saved a few bucks and went with this one. Highly recommend this case.",

                "reviewText": "I haven't even begun my build yet and have already found a problem with this case. My intent was to put a 360mm rad on both the top and side but there is absolutely no way the side mounts will take a 360mm rad.Update:If you plan to water cool your gpu then you will almost definitely need to mount it vertically. I attempted to mount mine normally but the waterblock stuck out by about 1/2\" too far to put the side back on the case.The front glass panel, although designed to be removeable, can't be removed. The top part of the case overhangs the top edge of it preventing it from being removed. Although this doesn't affect the function of the case it does make it a little more difficult to build in it by limiting access.There are six passthroughs for cables however only two have any protection on the edges. This means the protective case on the wires can be cut through quite easily while you pull them through. The two larger ones (with protection) are just a little too small.The mobo sits very low in this case. If you put a rad and fans, or even just fans, on the bottom then the lower edge of and ATX mobo would be covered making plugging anything in along that edge difficult.Cable management consists of \"stuff it in the back and cover it up\". There are no tiedown spots like are often found it better cases.Overall: While I was able to do (almost) what I wanted to do in this case it wasn't easy. There is lots of room for improvement.",
