                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Quality Case - Budget Conscious Price",
                "reviewText": "Needed to add some extra storage to my wife's PC and her OEM case wasn't setup to handle it. What's more, the OEM case had a single exhaust fan and no option for adding an intake fan or anything. (I'm looking at you ASUS). So I went looking for a replacement - wanted something that looked nice, would be easy to build in, and not too expensive. The Thermaltake Versa H17 definitely fit the bill. This is my first Thermaltake case. After my experience with the H17, I expect it won't be my last. (I'm giving serious consideration to moving my home server to a V21 cube chassis.)I'll go into detail about my experience with building in the case.First I'll mention, if you're re-using old parts or if you're on a tight budget and you've got / are getting a wired power supply instead of modular, the case is ideal. The H17 doesn't use traditional drive cages of any kind to mount drives - no doubt a cost saving measure - and instead uses a system rubber washers + screws where you can mount a 3.5\" hard drive to the floor of the case under the PSU cover and second 3.5\" hard drive under the top of the PSU cover. With this mounting system instead of drive cages, this leaves TONS of space to neatly tuck away your unused power supply cables.You mount 2.5\" drives in the same basic fashion as the 3.5\" drives, except the drives can mount on either side of the case's motherboard tray. I chose to mount drives to the back side of the tray to make cable management easier.The motherboard tray has a very large cutout to make access to the CPU backplate a breeze, should you ever need to. The side panels go on and off without any issues at all - unlike many other cases I've used over the years. Behind the motherboard tray there is PLENTY of room for cable management - especially when you include the space under the power supply cover. There are plenty of zip-tie points to help keep your wires tidy as well. If this case is missing anything it would be rubber grommets and velcro straps, however, including these would only end up increasing the price of the case.Let's talk for a minute about fans and cooling.With having a mostly solid front panel, there is going to be some restriction on the amount of air coming into the chassis. However, because the ventilation holes are on the front of the panel (instead of on the sides of the front panel like some other cases) the incoming air doesn't need to make a directional bend and lose pressure. The front of the case is listed as supporting up to 3 x 120mm or 2 x 140mm front fans along with 1 x 120mm or 140mm top fan (featuring a magnetic dust filter) and 1 x 120mm rear exhaust fan - a 3 pin basic black Thermaltake fan is included here. Only including the one fan is another cost saving measure on Thermaltake's part.When I purchased the case, I ordered 2 x 120mm Cougar Vortex PWM fans to use with it in addition to a 120mm Cryorig fan that I already own. While I don't think most people will need to add three fans to this case, I do highly recommend you get at least 1 decent fan to include as a front intake. My original plan was to include all 3 fans in the front of the case and leave the top fan location vacant. I changed my mind on this during the build for 2 reasons.1 - The wires for the buttons, LEDs, and ports on the top of the case are attached to the front panel. When you install the fans too high up in the case, it becomes difficult to route these wires into the case.2 - After I noted the position of the top fan location is in a more \"forward\" position relative to the CPU, I decided to put the 120mm Cryorig fan there as an intake fan. If the position were more toward the back, I'd have instead configured it as an exhaust fan. If I'd have made this fan an exhaust where it's located, I'd literally be stealing cool air that's coming into the chassis and exhausting it away from the CPU before it has a chance to make use of it. This is not withstanding that positive air pressure is best for managing dust. If this computer had a tower style CPU cooler (such as a Cryorig H7 or CoolerMaster 212 EVO) instead of a stock downdraft style cooler, I would not have added the top fan at all as this would just cause turbulence.If I were going to ding the score of this case for any reasons at all, it would be these points about the fan mountings. However, I don't feel it's appropriate to deduct from the score of this case at all. Here's why.As this case is a budget case, I don't expect many people who purchase it to plan on using 360mm AIO coolers - which could be difficult due to the wire issue that I mentioned - and in all honesty, I think the cooling configuration I've got in place right now is likely more optimal than my original plan for 3 fans in the front of the case. Running the 3 fans in the front would only have blown extra air under the power supply cover. Having the top fan more forward winds up being a plus because running an intake fan here alleviates any problems this case would have with pulling in sufficient air to keep things inside cool.All-in-all, if you're looking for an attractive case (especially if you don't want a windowed side panel) that is high on build quality but low on price, I would highly recommend you consider the Thermaltake Versa H17.",

                "reviewText": "First off, this was the case I chose for my first computer build in 15+ years, and it made things very easy and organized. It may not have all the flash, bells, or whistles as a lot of the fancier stuff on the market, but its significantly cheaper and gets most of the important stuff very right in my eyes.Pros:- Very easy to build in, with a great backplate to hide excess cables and excellent channels for cable routing- Aesthetics are deeply subjective, but I think this case looks awesome. It seems like its harder and harder to find a sleek and simple looking case with no gaudy additions like RGB or huge windows, without also looking like a 10 year old office PC. For me, this case toes that line perfectly and fits into my office very well- Instructions were simple and clear, not a whole lot of verbage but the pictures made things clear enough for me- Built in PSU shroud, which I think makes the whole package look so much tidier and isn't common at this price point- Enough room for a full size GPU; I have a 1660 ti in mine and there's plenty of space to spare- Fits a good amount of fans; I have 3 140mm fans installed in the case in addition to the one rear 120mm fan that came includedCons:- Airflow in the case could be better, specifically the front plate blocks a good amount of airflow from being brought in. There are very small perforations in the front panel and a small opening at the bottom, none of which allow for much air to be brought in. There is a pretty noticeable difference in the amount of air being brought in with the front panel off, which makes me think its definitely the front panel design and not just my fans. When I'm gaming for any significant time, the side panel gets fairly hot to the touch. All that being said, according to CAM software my Ryzen 5 hasn't been pushed over 65 degrees and the 1660 ti has hit 69 degrees max under heavy load.- If I'm being nitpicky, I wish the side panels and front panel were a little more uniform looking. The front panel is matte black plastic and the sides are matte black aluminum, and I just wish they looked a little more uniform at the point they meet. That's me really looking for something though...Overall, I love this case and am very glad I went with it. I was considering a Fractal Designs case that was three times as much for the same basic functionality, and I'm happy I chose to put that money to work elsewhere in the PC budget. Yes, the case is a little on the warm side, but not so much that it's a major concern for me. If you're looking for a simple and clean case to build a moderately powerful PC in, this should be at the top of your list.",

Front mesh panel provides enough cool airflow into the cabinet while maintaining the beauty of RGB. PSU shroud has honeycomb structure ventilation which provides both airflow and rgb effects of psu. Right panel side has got enough space to manage all those messy cable is one more pros. Side tempered glass comes with 4 screws. I wish it would have been hinge mechanism for quick opening.
