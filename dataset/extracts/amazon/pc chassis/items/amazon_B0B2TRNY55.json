Top case cover includes fan holes to vent PSU so if you plan to stack these space has to be left between each server or PSU configured to vent in a different way than normal.Two included fans are fairly quiet.A bit cramped as expected given 12\" depth. Not bad, would buy again given not much available under 12\" depth. Wish there was a 4U version.",

                "reviewText": "Sadly I had to return this case. Its built very well and love that its a short depth case. There are a few main reasons I had to return it. 1. Modular power supplies will NOT fit in this case. The hard drive mounting plate is too close to the power supply plugs. This is the main reason I had returned the case, i didn't want to buy a new power supply to make this case work. 2. The hard drive mounting plate is a P.I.T.A to remove. In order to remove or add hard drives, you have to take the power supply out first then remove the hard drive mounting plate. I wasted too much time trying to do this. The hard drive mounting plate will also conflict with many CPU coolers, you will most likely need to buy a low profile CPU cooler. Some other reviews say you can only mount 2 ssd hard drives, this is NOT true. I was able to install 4 Samsung ssd's. Two on the DVD drive side, there are 8 mounting holes on that side, and two on the 3.5\" hard drive side. This is a well made case, and if I had a small form factor power supply and a mini-itx motherboard, it would have worked great.",

Have to make sure that your cpu cooling solution and whatever expansion cards you are using are not too tall for the chasis, but for the moderate hardware I used it worked out great.The build quality for the chasis itself isn't the absolute best I've ever worked with and it doesn't have some of the bells and whistles more expensive ones might have, but given its price it is more than reasonable.",
