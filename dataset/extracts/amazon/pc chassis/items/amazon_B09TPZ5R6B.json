And they look great. 3 slot cards and tall CPU coolers may not fit so well, so check ahead of time. The assembly isn't too bad. Although there are some nuances, you may have to disassemble things in a certain order to reach the parts properly. It's very heavy as well. I've expected with glass.

                "reviewText": "I bought this case for my new gaming PC. I\u2019m very pleased with the build quality, airflow, ease to build in of this case. I decided to go air cooled GPU and CPU and have had zero issues with temperature, everything is running nice and cool (I added two intake fans when building on the side mount just to be safe). Cable management is no problem, just remember to install all of the connections on the bottom of your motherboard so you don\u2019t have to pull the GPU back out to add a USB connector. Remember that the GPU is vertically mounted which will obstruct the lower PCIe slots on your motherboard if you intend to add a wireless card, sound card, capture cards, etc.",

                "reviewText": "Super nice case, quality put together, thoughtful features. Super clean cable management. The case is designed for liquid cool system. GPU sits really close to the glass and if its air cooled its going to get hot and fans will be working full speed all around. I have an AIO CPU cooler and air cooled gpu, it runs the fans full speed. Wish the case allowed horizontal GPU mounting as that would help out A LOT. It has half sized ports for other expansion cards so if you wanted to mount it horizontally chances are your GPU wont fit and have something to mount it to. These days most people aren't putting in expansion cards. i also, wish the riser cable was PCie gen 5. but other than that, the case is super clean! really shows off your components. The usb on the front is in a great location too. Its a big beefy case!",

Su dise\u00f1o espacioso proporciona un entorno ideal para ensamblar y organizar los componentes de manera eficiente, ofreciendo no solo est\u00e9tica, sino tambi\u00e9n funcionalidad.Una de las caracter\u00edsticas notables de este gabinete es la presencia de filtros de polvo f\u00e1cilmente removibles, lo que simplifica considerablemente la tarea de mantenimiento y limpieza.
