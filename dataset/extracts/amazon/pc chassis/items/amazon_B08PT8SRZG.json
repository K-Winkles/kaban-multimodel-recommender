                "reviewText": "For the money, the case has some pretty nice features. If you're into lights with various setting options and plenty of ventilation fans, then look no more. The unit came with some basic instructions for the features, but not much more. You can get some better ideas on their website and via the video attached to the page.The unit was a bit larger than I had expected. Lots of room to work with and tons of wires going everywhere for the lights and fans. Adjusting the riser posts to fit my mobo was not too difficult. Everything seemed to go were it needed. Figuring out how to get the power supply installed took me a couple of minutes (both sides of the case are removable). Duh.Even with a new power supply, routing the cables was kind of a challenge. Using a miniATX board meant the distance to reach was a bit longer, so it took some finagling to get them just right. Mounting the 2 SSD drives were also a bit of a challenge. There's not a lot of clearance, so you have to have SSD cables that are STRAIGHT END types, and the SATA power cables have to get pretty flat as well. Took some time to figure out the frames for the SSD drives didn't require unscrewing from the frame, and are held in place by rubber grommets that allow you to remove the frames with a bit of steady pressure.Once everything was in place, the unit fired up nicely. Lots of fans mean a bit more noise as well. They are NOT quiet, but not too annoying either. Changing the LED settings for the fan colors was kind of fun. There's no real guide to know how many pushes of the LED button (by the power button) will yield what kind of color combination you're looking for, so just keep pressing until it displays something you like.Mounting the Blu-Ray ODD was easy. Make sure you have mounting screws available.All in all, I'm pretty impressed. It took time, but I am happy with the final results. Looks nice in my home studio.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these cases and they have to be one of the best cases for the $ available today. The five included fans are quiet and good at moving air through the case. The ability to add an optical drive was a major plus for me since I still have to deal with some archived DVD files. I installed Asus gen 11 Intel i7 ATX motherboard in the case and it runs very cool with the stock fans and Noctua cooling tower. The factory cabling is a bit messy for the fans but with some tie wraps I was able to make the installation quite clean. I installed a modular power supply and two hard drives in the bay areas. Both were easy to access especially since the drive bay is removeable. The built in cabling management consists of two installed velcro wraps with a third one provided in the box. These plus a couple of tie wraps provided a clean mounting of the cable. The RGB fans worked great and the LED button on the top provide a simple method of personalizing the color. The case is very open and you can access everything without tearing up your fingers. The numerous air slots have included dust covers which should keep the system cleaner. Overall I think this case really offers great value and quality.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:Beautiful modern looking case5 included fans (3 RGB)Fan and rgb controller includedOptical drive bay w/ door to hide itSturdy, thoughtful design with no sharp edgesTons of mount bays for hard drives (all sizes)Great cable managementVirtually toolless designIncludes velcro tie offs, screws, and other little accessoriesMagnetic dust filtersFull tempered glass side panelCons:Fan controller will run all the fans at 100% = loudMy head is 3 ft. from the case (on my desk) and it sounds like if you had an old oscillating standing room fan next to your head at max power. I ended up plugging the 3 front fans into my motherboard fan headers and using the BIOS to regulate the speed of the fans.Controlling the RGB lighting on the case might use different software compared to other RGB effects in your buildBecause I use the RGB controller that came with the case, there is a button on the case that lets you cycle through the different lights and settings for the 3 RGB fans in the front. I have Corsair RBG memory that uses its own iCue software to control the effects on the memory sticks. My CPU fan is plugged into the motherboard and I use the motherboard software to control that. Three different RGB light sources = three different methods to manage it. Your setup will likely differ and it may not affect your decision at all, but worth mentioning.Overall:I have been building PCs for 20+ years and this has been my favorite case to build in so far. I am a gamer and have no heat issues with this case. I bought this case in December 2020 and I still love looking at it today. My picture shows the case without the glass side panel (it was reflecting the light I used to illuminate the inside of the case) and it has a Ryzen sticker on the PSU shroud that I put there myself. The case is a dream to work with, build in, hide cables in, and look at. The case is a steal for the price. I did find a cheaper case that I also liked, but it didn't include as many fans nor the fan controller; once you add those costs to that case, this easily became the better value. The lack of thorough documentation didn't bother me since I've been doing this a long time (lots of videos online anyway). The fan controller and RGB management notes I put in the \"Cons\" section was only a minor nuisance during the setup; once setup, I don't even think about it. No \"reset\" button which I initially didn't like, but if you have a stable system, how often are you really pushing that button anyway? I don't even notice that it doesn't have one. In the end: buy it, you'll be glad you did.",
