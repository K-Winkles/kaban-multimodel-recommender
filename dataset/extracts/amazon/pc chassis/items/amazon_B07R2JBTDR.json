                "reviewText": "Update: I\u2019m posting a picture of exactly why I bought this case and of the fifth fan installed where the 5.25\u201d bay is. I bought this handle in a four pack for about $15, it\u2019s for play sets.Original: I like this case more than I thought I would. First thing you should know is that you can fit a fifth fan behind where the 5.25 slot is, on the inside of the case. I highly recommend doing that to keep airflow optimized.I will say that this is a very flimsy and lightweight case. Both would normally be cons, but for my purposes they really aren't.I bought this case to build a gaming PC that I can easily transport. It has a solid top that I can attach a handle to. It's light weight helps keep it light weight, I know, shocking. Compared to my other gaming PC I recently built, this feels a bit lighter. I haven't weighted either but perhaps I will in the future.Honestly, I like this case. I like the solid black panels, the OEM look it tends to have, and the mounting for a fan in the side cover. Although it is cheap feeling, with how thing the steel is, it's really easy to build in and pretty well thought out. The only cable management issue is the power supply cables have to be directly fed through a hole to the \"back\" side panel. Other than that it seems fine to me.Although I do like this case, if you spend just $20-30 more you can get a better case. You should only buy this if you're on an extremely tight budget and need a case right now or if you want a low profile OEM looking build.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A MINI Mid-Tower ATX Case",
                "reviewText": "OK, so I thought this $45 case would be a decent start to a PC build for a friend using some of my older FX era components. Mid-Tower, check, fits ATX mobo, check. This isn't a normal mid tower case. It's REALLY small. Yes, it does fit ATX motherboards but I thought initially that it should be made for m-ATX boards and have the PSU mounted on the bottom of the case (PSU is mounted on top making it a little top heavy). At least that's what I though when I pulled it out of the box. Of course I used a measuring tape to compare the dimensions to my other cases before purchase but that didn't prepare me for the actually size of this dinky thing.So, complaining out of the way, I looked it over and it seemed well built. A little flimsy in spots but for the price it was ok. I managed to get a full ATX board with a Hyper 212 Evo CPU cooler in there along with one SSD and one 3.5\" HDD, three fans (2 in, 1 out...space for a 4th fan on the side too but that was blocked by the CPU cooler), a standard size PSU and a 5.25\" DVD drive since my friend wanted that. The GPU was just a small Radeon 5450 so that barely took up any room. It works and it's actually a great case! I'd build in it again! It could easily fit some of the newer graphics cards like my EVGA 1660 Super or my old R9 280. The 280 might give you a little problems but those could be fixed with some front IO cable extensions. They're a bit short.One tip...Mount the front fans before anything else. I always mount my fans first but since this thing was tiny inside I decided to mount them last because I figured they screwed in from the outside. Nope, they screw in from the inside. I had to remove the RAM and the cooler to get them in. No big deal but kind of a pain. Reading the instructions might have helped.It's a good case even though it's small and cheap. The price and decent fit and finish made it a good random choice for me since there was only one review when I bought it. The biggest outside features I was impressed with were the top mounted power/reset buttons that feel like they are from something at least $20 more expensive. Very clicky and well placed.The side bulges are great for cable management even though I shoved half of cables for my non-modular PSU on top of the DVD drive inside the case. The bulges also gave me the room to mount the Hyper 212 cooler. Without those it wouldn't have fit. I think 160mm is the max and the 212 is 159mm, I believe, The fourth fan slot on the side is also blocked by the massive cooler so no fan there. I also painted the top aluminum fin black so it doesn't show through the vent holes on that side. It all works great and I'd do it again. Small but capable. Just don't expect more than one of each type of drive SSD/3.5\" without getting a little creative.Recommended!",

It has excellent airflow, and extra fans can be added. Some reviewers mention the light weight. It is light compared to some old cases I've used, but it is not flimsy at all. It fits a full size ATX mb without any problems. An added bonus is the super bright led's on the cases top. At night they make a great lightshow on my ceiling...lol. This is a great case for any build.",

I chose this because it had a slot for a DVD player, came with a fan, and because it was dirt cheap. Upon arrival, the first thing I noticed was just how light the case was. While installing my new motherboard and drives, I discovered that case design has progressed significantly since my last case. Everything is so much easier to mount and access. I would not hesitate to buy this case again.",

Hole in case front if you want it for 5.25\" disk drive BUT no structure to hang it on. No issue for me. Plenty of screws included including mounts for motherboards as the case side is not flat so they are needed if you have an ATX motherboard. Single small fan on rear (80mm) but vent holes for 120mm fan on side. Does what I need so a good purchasae for me.",
