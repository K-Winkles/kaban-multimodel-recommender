                "reviewText": "The case came in with many of the plastic tabs supporting the front panel broken. This was fixed with some superglue but this problem is reflective of the quality of the materials used. The case does have a nice aesthetic and is hard to beat for the price. The trade off here being lower quality materials being used. I would recommend saving $20-30 more dollars and buy a more premium case but for those on a budget this might be the right fit.",

Every time I plug a keyboard into it, the keyboard seizes to stop working roughly about 15 minutes after. The cable management is really bad, for an 80$ case, just get a Corsair. This thing blows.",

                "reviewText": "I can\u2019t compare cases because this was my first PC build, but if you\u2019re looking for a budget build that has adequate airflow this is one to look into. Comes with 4 RGB fans that installs into ur power supply, and the front panel pattern makes it stand out. I\u2019ll say the only downside about it the case is that you can\u2019t control the lights and adjust to any colors, it stays the same. But in all honesty like I mentioned before it\u2019s a great case for a budget build. I put my whole build together for only $700 and I\u2019d recommend this case if you don\u2019t mind what color the fans are. Super quite, well lit, and good airflow.",
