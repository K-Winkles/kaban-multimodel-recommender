                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best Micro ATX case for under $100",
                "reviewText": "Overall Rating: 4 out of 5 starsFor: MicroATX builders seeking a stylish and spacious case, fans of minimalist aesthetics, those prioritizing airflowAgainst: Limited cable management options, awkward disk drive installation, tight PSU spaceDesign and Build Quality: 4.5 out of 5 starsThe Prime AP201 punches above its weight in the design department. Its sleek, tempered glass panel and minimalist aesthetic blend seamlessly into any setup. The build quality is solid, with a sturdy steel frame and high-quality materials. It might be compact, but it feels surprisingly hefty and well-constructed.Space and Compatibility: 4 out of 5 starsDespite its 33-liter footprint, the AP201 manages to pack in impressive space for a MicroATX build. It supports ATX power supplies, long graphics cards, and even 360mm AIO coolers, making it surprisingly versatile for its size. However, be warned: cable management can be a bit tricky due to limited routing options behind the motherboard tray.Cooling: 5 out of 5 starsAirflow is king in the AP201. Its perforated mesh front panel and strategically placed fan mounts ensure ample air circulation. It comes with one pre-installed 120mm rear fan, but there's plenty of room for adding additional fans or AIO coolers for truly exceptional cooling performance.Ease of Use: 4 out of 5 starsThe tool-less side panels are a breeze to remove and reinstall, making access to your components easy. However, the disk drive installation, while possible, can be a bit awkward due to limited space. The tight PSU compartment might also require careful cable management to avoid obstructing airflow.Value: 4 out 25 starsThe AP201 offers a lot of bang for your buck. Its stylish design, spacious interior, and excellent cooling potential make it a compelling choice for MicroATX builders. However, the cable management challenges and awkward disk drive installation hold it back from a perfect score in the value department.Things to Consider:Limited Cable Management: Routing space behind the motherboard tray is limited, requiring careful planning and potentially creative solutions.Awkward Disk Drive Installation: Installing 2.5\" or 3.5\" drives can be a bit cramped and require specific mounting brackets.Tight PSU Space: Ensure your PSU cables are flexible and well-managed to avoid obstructing airflow.Final Verdict:The ASUS Prime AP201 is a fantastic choice for MicroATX builders who prioritize style, airflow, and spaciousness. Its compact design packs a surprising punch, and its minimalist aesthetics will fit seamlessly into any setup. However, be prepared to tackle some cable management challenges and potentially invest in additional fan mounts or brackets for optimal performance. For those willing to put in a bit of extra effort, the AP201 rewards with a cool, stylish, and surprisingly versatile MicroATX build experience.Note:This review is based on my research and analysis of the ASUS Prime AP201. Your experience may vary depending on your specific components and configurations.Feel free to adapt and personalize this review to your own experience and preferences. You can add specific details about your build, cable management solutions, or comparisons with other MicroATX cases.",

                "reviewText": "It's not the smallest case out there, but it's certainly high quality.There's a surprising about of room to build. The tight fit pieces can be taken out and placed back in quite easily.Cable management channels are spacious, and there's some cable ties included.Air Flow seems to going extremely well, though I guess that's a given seeing as the whole case is basically a mesh.The actual quality of the parts is more than I'd ever expect for this price. The case feels stable. The side panels pop off and snap back on very easily.At this price range, it's an absolute recommendation.",

                "reviewText": "I know it's all the rage now to make these ITX cases smaller and smaller, but I wanted something that not only would easily fit on my desk, but was roomy enough inside that the components could breathe and not be packed so closely together. My setup is a i7 11700 with a RTX 4080. I use 100% Noctua cooling as I want the pc to be silent. I run games at 4k for hours and the noise level blends in with the ambient background noise such that I don't notice it at all in this case. I tried this same setup in a couple of other cases before settling on this one, so I thought I'd share some comparisons.The first case was I tried this combo in was the NR200. It's MUCH smaller than this case. My main gripes with it are that you are stuck with ITX power supplies with their tiny and whiny high rpm fans. And everything gets so crammed together in this case, it's hard for components to get very good airflow, even with mesh panels. Too many obstructions. So the fans would rev up more than I liked under hard gaming. Tried air and water cooling, same result with either. The cables coming out of the power supply have to be tied up really tightly and even then are very close to the GPU fan.Okay, so let's get something with some space inside, the Torrent Nano. Much improved over the NR200, stays (mostly) frosty on the inside. Has a giant 200mm fan on the front that pushes an amazing amount of air over components. You can feel the positive pressure pushing out of every hole in the case. I used a front to back cooling setup. No need for bottom fans cooling the GPU, as it stayed so cool from being blasted by the big fan in the front that they weren't necessary. A couple of (to me) fatal flaws caused me to look for something else:- The front usb ports were made from incredibly cheap pot metal and would quickly fail after a few months of use. The manufacturer was good about sending replacements, but they were as bad as the ones being replaced and also failed. You would plugin a drive, and it would connect and disconnect in a sort of loop. Transferring large files was impossible due to this.- The power supply sits directly over the cpu cooler, and thus it's intake fan is sucking in hot air coming off the cooler. I had situations where, while gaming, the power supply would shut down due to overheating. The cooler was literally cooking the power supply, even with that big fan blowing air through the case. This was with 1000 and 1300 watt supplies and the pc was only drawing around 375 watts according to my meter when it happened, so it couldn't have been due to current limiting.So, here I am with this case, and so far so good. Super easy to build in. Looks great on the desk. Lots of options and intelligent locations for cable routing so you get a clean look. PC stays really cool and quiet. Only need two 120 Noctuas to keep things frosty. Front ports make solid, reliable connections. I think this one could be a keeper, fingers crossed.",
