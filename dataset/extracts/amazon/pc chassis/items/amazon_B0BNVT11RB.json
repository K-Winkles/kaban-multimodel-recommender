But when it\u2019s on it\u2019s niceFirst picture was original build before upgrades.Ryzen 7 5800x the og not the 3d lol, early adopterGigabyte b450m ds3h rev 1. Upgraded pictures is the Msi b550 a-pro atx4x8gb Corsair vengeance rgb proRx 5600 xt gigabyte OC rev 1. UPGRADE: rx 7900 xt, Xfx black editionI have each type of drive in this thingId cooling towerUpdate: deep cool ls720 360mmPsu was originally thermaltake smart 500w. Updated psu is thermaltake toughpower gf3 1000wRgb strip is ezdiy fab 1000mmI transferred most of these parts from my old deep cool mattrexx 30 case.Simply changing cases improved my benchmarks with the same hardware from the better airflow.Fans are thermaltake riing quad 120( I returned these due to disconnecting issues) update: coolermaster 120 halo fans.Case:Both side panels come off in very clean ways. The magnets on the glass panel are very strong, I need to use 2 hands and I can bench my body weightThe rear panel has thumbscrews that stay on the panel so they don\u2019t fall on the floor. Big plusThere is a decent amount of room for cable management but it is a little tricky trying to fit rgb controllers and fan hubs. Now if you do not have a hard drive those would be no problemSpeaking of hard drive. The mounting tray unscrews and slides out allowing you to mount 2 3.5 inch hdd. Or you can mount 1 hdd and mount an extra 2.5\u201d ssd on the top. If you don\u2019t need these drives it is a perfect spot to fit fan controllers/hubsThe gpu bracket is cool.Power supply shroud looks great, where the psu sits has extra rubber for it to sit on easing vibration.Dust filters are magnetic and good.FYI the digital temp display requires a software to download and run but it is super low utilization. For me it uses 34mb of ram and 0% cpu and gpu. It is great that it is not bloatware.Despite what I\u2019ve seen 3x120 mm fit on both the front and the top. With room to spare. UPDATE if using a 360 aio on the top there is very little room for the tubes when there are 3 fans in the front. Mine make contact with the casing for the top fan. The bottom 120mm mounts I am unsure about. The one is directly above the power supply and would not get much air to the fan, there is only a half inch gap from the power supply. I will be testing that later. UPDATE: as I now have fans in those spots I can say they definitely move air but I\u2019m not entirely sure how effective it is. I just make sure to have the bottom front intake fan running at a higher rpm so that it is helping air to be back there.",

                "reviewText": "This case just looks amazing and out of all the cases I have had I am the most impressed with this one. The built in LED screen is a nice plus to have to keep either your GPU or CPU temps in check and are actually accurate. Airflow on this case isn't among the best but its still has good airflow with a front and top mesh filter to keep the dust out. Easy to assemble and can even fit a 360mm radiator on the top but beware that mounting fans will likely scratch the case. What I mean by that is that when you screw in the screws I noticed it does scratch the case and the black color seems to chip off, other than that the case does smudge easily. Overall I think it is well worth the price of $99.99 and offers a lot for its price range. Very happy.",

                "reviewText": "I was stuck between a few cases but settled on this one. It met all my needs as far as dimensions and asthetics. The case has lots of room. I have a zotac 3070 dual oc GPU and wanted to upgrade in the future. My last case made that impossible being that my 3070 barely fit with the radiator up front. Cable management was OK in this case. Overall for the price and quality I could not find better. And I looked for weeks before deciding on this one. I am glad I did. The only thing I wish is if it came with 1 more fan and that they were both rgb. But that's cheap and I can dyi. (Last photo is reference of my old case build with no room) if you're stuck figuring out what case to get. Let me help you. Get this one.",
