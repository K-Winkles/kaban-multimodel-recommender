                "reviewText": "I just built an awesome budget gaming rig with this great case and it looks so damn fresh! I stress that this case is for budget rigs so I'm talking low powered CPU's and GPU's such as the 65w i5-10400f cpu and a GTX 970 4gb gpu I'm using on a B560 motherboard (3600mhz ram speed in XMP with the i5-10400f is a bonus!).Cons: 1) The included Antec case fans appear to be proprietized with the front panel switch so swapping out or adding more fans could be cumbersome. 2) There's no fan speed controller or any compatibility from the included fans to plug into motherboard fan headers so the included Antec fans will be running at the same speed all the time. 3) I had trouble figuring out why I couldn't restart my PC from Windows 10 without having to hit the front panel power switch so I discovered that unplugging the HDD LED headers from my motherboard resolved this issue. This is fine if you don't need to use the front panel HDD LED's but plan on using the fan LED switch on the front panel to change the fan RGB patterns and colors on the included Antec case fans. This is controlled by the Reset switch header wired to the rear fan and powered by your PSU's molex cable.Pros: 1) The one speed Antec case fans came properly pre-installed and are actually quite efficient under all my component loads. When idle, my motherboard keeps under 27c, i5-10400f keeps under 28c (using a Deepcool Gammax 400 cooler) and I don't really notice fan noise. When gaming, my GTX 970 stays under 78c max and the 10400f under 60c max while cpu fan noise is also tolerable. I don't really need to use any more fans to keep my budget PC cool. 2) The fan LED switch and RGB effects work beautifully. A simply push of the button and I get a different fan light show or color. Saves you time and windows memory from opening up an app and go through several clicks. 3) The swinging tempered glass door can easily be removed by simply lifting it from the latches. 4) It' s only $50! This Antec case is in line with the front mesh airflow trend. The compact shape gives it a deceptive look of a micro ATX case yet the vertical design is a perfect fit for ATX boards. The space for the PSU and cable management scheme in the back panel is decent. The overall build quality and material isn't that shabby. It just looks simple, clean, and unique. Amazing value for an amazing budget case here in 2021!",

                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these cases to build my kids pc\u2019s for the holidays. It is very well built for the price and glass siding looks amazing. One case did come with the fans rgb not working, I emailed them and they responded very quickly and when we came to the conclusion the main fan is bad, they quickly sent out a new one to replace it. Will buy another whenever I decide to build myself a pc. The fans do not hook up to the motherboard so it\u2019s one speed all the time but as the builds were for my kids I don\u2019t need to worry about messing with the fan fluctuations which is perfect.",

                "reviewText": "After purchasing the Antec Performance 1 case and being very satisfied with it, I decided to get the NX410 for my kids PC. My initial reaction is that I can see a significant difference in quality and features between the Performance 1 and the NX410. If you don't mind the size of a full tower, the Performance 1 is clearly worth the extra money. That said, the NX410 is a solid value case and I don't regret purchasing it.The NX410 case has all the necessary features. I used many parts from my older full tower build for this PC and everything fit. The Noctua cooler just BARELY fit, but it did and the tempered glass does not touch the cooler. Unlike the higher end Performance 1 model, the NX410 lacks some of the nicer cable management straps, but it does have access points for all the cables to run behind the motherboard and out of sight--you just have to use zip-ties to manage them which can be a little annoying. The lower area holding the power supply and potentially 2 SSD drives can be extremely tight and I'd strongly recommend a modular power supply (I'd recommend it anyway even with a different case). On that note, you will need 90 degree sata cables to use the lower SSD bays, but if you don't have them, there are 2 other slots you can use.If you're interested in RGB, this case does come with RGB fans. I believe they are Antec's lower end models, but they run quiet and have been working fine. Antec has them preconfigured to daisy-chain off of one another, with the back fan serving as the primary connection point. So, you'll want to leave that setup unless you plan on using your own controller. That said, I didn't have any issues running the daisy-chain setup and it has worked well so far.In sum, I'm satisfied with the product. It's a good value case, but you should know going in that it is a value case. The case quality overall feels lower, the back expansion slot panels break off instead of individual screw on covers, the cable management relies on zip-ties, there are tight spaces like the PSU area. These are things I expect though when I buy a value case. So, while the NX410 is a solid case, if you have the space and a bit of extra money, I do recommend that higher end Performance 1 over this case.",

                "reviewText": "Un acierto total de compra. Buscaba una torre espaciosa, bonita y con buena ventilaci\u00f3n. Esta lo cumple todo y m\u00e1s. Montar los componentes dentro y conectar los cables ha sido realmente f\u00e1cil, ya que dispone de mucho espacio para maniobrar y muchas ranuras por donde pasar los cables. Tiene un compartimento debajo para colocar los discos duros, pero se puede desacoplar desatornill\u00e1ndolo muy f\u00e1cilmente y dejar libre ese espacio para que los cables de la fuente de alimentaci\u00f3n no est\u00e9n tan apretados. Por otra parte viene con dos ventiladores grandes en el frontal y uno peque\u00f1o para disipar el calor por la parte trasera, todos bastante silenciosos (cierto es que mi placa base permite controlar la velocidad para adaptarla seg\u00fan la carga de trabajo) no obstante yo los he cambiado de ubicaci\u00f3n porque ya compr\u00e9 en su momento unos potentes. Pueden colocarse en el frontal, en la parte de arriba y en la de abajo de la torre, ya que \u00e9sta \u00faltima no es lisa, sino una rejilla en panal. El cristal es un cristal templado de verdad (no una chapa de plasticucho) que se abre como una puerta que se puede extraer empuj\u00e1ndola hacia arriba., ya que tiene bisagras y un cierre imantado. En cuanto al aspecto est\u00e9tico muy bonita. Mantiene una armon\u00eda entre simple pero elegante, y da la sensaci\u00f3n de pulcritud.",
