From the first day I set them up they've been bringing me joy in the yard. If nobody is outside, I keep them set at 25%. The remote is very handy if I forget to turn them down after having been on 100% for a get together - from inside the house. One time all summer long I took the charging unit in the house to charge via usb. Other than that, the sunlight provided kept these lights going beautifully.",
