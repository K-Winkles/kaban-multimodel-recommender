                "reviewText": "I bought this set to compliment/finish setting up my balcony. The chairs are small enough to fit in little nooks but not small enough to be uncomfortable. I was actually expecting them to be smaller so I was delighted that they fit but are also not children size.Putting the first chair together wasn't fun but I did the second one in no time. I finished the first one w my drill but ended up tightening the second one by hand instead. Just have some patience. There's a qr code for a video too to help you along.In all, I'd say it's a good value for your $. I don't foresee this lasting very long tbh in the 90 degree summer weather as some of the rattan seems to crack/break easily if you are not careful but if I get a good year, year and a half out of it I'd say I did good.Very cute. More comfy than expected. Good value.We'll see how it holds up over time.",
