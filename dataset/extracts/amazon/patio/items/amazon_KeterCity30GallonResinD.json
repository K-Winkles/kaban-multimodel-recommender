The box was easy to assemble, lightweight and plenty sturdy for the use we had in mind. It looks nice on our deck, too. I had this thing assembled in less than 5 minutes (just 6 snap-together pieces). It held 4 large seat cusions, 2 decorative pillows and 2 hammocks just about perfectly. Within minutes of being put on the deck and filled with cushions, it began POURING down rain, but when the rain stopped, everything was perfectly dry! Great buy for us.",

The design is brilliant and results is a box with a hinged lid far stronger than the weight would lead you to believe. I use mine as a parcels drop point and weight it down with a breeze block inside - perfect. The only reservation i would have is the security of the box if in a vulnerable position - there seems little point in putting a padlock on a box which could be broken into very easily by kicking in the side, forcing the lid, or simply lifting up and stealing the lot! But if security isn't an issue, then 5/5.",
