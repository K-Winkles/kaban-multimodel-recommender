                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I just took this out of the box an hour ago and already I\u2019m writing a review because it is just such a cool tabletop accent. I love fire as ambiance and already have a stone oil lamp and candles on our back porch table. I have a chiminea out back that I love to burn and this seemed like the perfect addition to the flaming devices collection. When you first use it the wick takes a couple minutes to absorb the alcohol and give you a nice flame. The sides do get hot but the bottom does not. A five star review for sure!",

My wife discovered this and thought it could be fun to be able to make s'mores inside over a fire. The product itself is constructed very well. It is pretty heavy from the material it is made from. It also comes with a metal plate to put over the fire to suffocate it. My family has had a lot of fun with this and would recommend it to anyone that might enjoy this.",

We get the readily available 92% isopropyl to use as fuel. Lasts a reasonable amount of time.",
