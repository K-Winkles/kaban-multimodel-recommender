You actually need the long ones for specific part bc the short screws aren\u2019t long enough. I ended up have to just not screws in 2 holes bc they needed the longer screws and I didn\u2019t have anymore left. It takes a while to put it together if you\u2019re putting it together by hand. And it\u2019s hard to screw bc how it is constructed. But the set is very cute. My table didn\u2019t stick to the suction cups so I had to reinforce them with command strips. Otherwise looking forward to using it.",

I had no issues with holes lining up or missing parts. They look very nice too. I will definitely purchase more.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased 2 of these patio sets, each consisting of two chairs and a small table with a tempered glass top, and I am thrilled to say that it exceeded all my expectations.First and foremost, the setup process was an absolute breeze. Within an hour of unboxing, I had both of the sets assembled and ready to use.One of the standout features of this patio set is its compact design. With limited space on my small patio, I was searching for furniture that wouldn't overwhelm the area. This set fit the bill perfectly. The chairs are perfectly proportioned, and the small table with a tempered glass top complements the chairs without dominating the space. It strikes the ideal balance between functionality and space efficiency, providing a comfortable seating area while leaving plenty of room for movement and other outdoor essentials.What truly amazed me, however, was the remarkable durability of this patio set. It recently endured an unexpectedly severe wind and rainstorm, which put its resilience to the ultimate test. To my astonishment, despite the chairs being thrown against my neighbor's house and the tempered glass top colliding with their brick siding, not a single piece of glass was shattered. The set emerged unscathed! Which I am still in awe of!I definitely recommend this patio set to anyone seeking a combination of ease of setup, compact design, and outstanding durability. Its simple assembly process and small footprint make it a perfect fit for small patios or outdoor spaces with limited room. Moreover, its ability to withstand a powerful storm and prevent any damage to the tempered glass top is truly impressive.PS: NO compensation, discount, or anything was given for this review. I purchased this myself and would again in a heartbeat.",

The cushions are nice but could be thicker and I don't like how short the table is but the glass table top is thick and easy to wipe clean.",
