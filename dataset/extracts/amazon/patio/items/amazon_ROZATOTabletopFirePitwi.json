                "reviewText": "I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend, who loves campfires. Unfortunately, we don't have much space for one at our apartment, so I thought this would be a great alternative.He was so excited about it and loves using it. It looks great on our coffee table. The flames are contained, but do get a bit higher than the sides, so may not be great for those with kids or animals. It also takes a lot of rubbing alcohol to keep it going, which can be a bit inconvenient.",

                "reviewText": "We had a Nostalgia smore maker and my daughter and her friend were disappointed in the performance. They pulled out a torch for cooking to get their marshmallows charred. Bought this and it was delivered fast and it looks beautiful on my dining room table. It has everything you need to roast marshmallows and it also gives off a warm heat on those frosty nights. Which is wonderful at dinner. I can\u2019t count how many times we have used it, because we have used it so often. Unlike the Nostalgia, in which we maybe used 3 times in 5 years.",
