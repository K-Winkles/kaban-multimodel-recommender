                "reviewText": "Mixed reviews made me hesitate, but it's exactly what I was looking for at a fantastic price so I ordered. It was very quick to arrive. Opened the box-everything well-organized, packed carefully, each piece covered individually. Everything came in perfect condition.I was shocked after reading some of the horrible reviews It's a sturdy set with some weight to it, so I know it will hold up to some wind. I assembled it myself in about 1.5 hours taking my time. It's painstaking, but the instructions were easy. Each chair is only 4 panels with 11 screws each. Very simple and well-designed. I had the biggest challenge with the table. It's also great quality and looks very nice, but the assembly screws are all inserted on the inside from underneath, just a bit hard to see working down into a space with a dark color. It's a tighter space to work in with an Allen wrench, but it's worth it. Keeping the screws hidden gives the set a higher-quality appearance. I'm looking at some throw pillows to add, and then it will be perfect. I completely love the set. The key to easy assembly, as mentioned by others, is not to tighten the screws until all of them have been loosely seated. My pieces came together beautifully. The legs all sit flush to the floor, no wobble. I'm absolutely thrilled with how this looks in my seating area, and it's comfortable! FYI: I'm female, 55yo, 5'8\", 130 lbs if it helps give perspective to my review.",

                "reviewText": "It was boxed very well with all necessary pieces. There are no paper instructions. Instead there is a part list with a QR code for a video. Not all of the parts were labeled but it was easy to figure out with the part list.The video is someone (Russian?) in sweatpants explaining how to assemble. Broken English/subtitles but straightforward. That being said, his pieces were labeled differently and there were more of them. Again, not hard to figure out the corresponding one regardless.A couple of issues crept up in assembly. I\u2019ve assembled more than my fair share of IKEA furniture so this should have been much faster than it was. You use about 12 or so screws per chair (less than the video says). On my first chair, the holes to attach pieces did not line up well at all. In the video he hand tightens all of them. I was able to do about 2 that method. The remaining 10 or so had to be done with the included tool which took forever. In addition, the front of the seat was bent while the place to attach wasn\u2019t. Luckily it was able to be bent the other way but again the holes did not align. After exactly one hour of non stop tightening all 12 screws were done and chair one was complete.Chair two went much better thankfully with all but about 2 screws being hand tightened before the tool. Only one hole was not aligned and the front portion was not bent. It and the table were done in a combined 45 minutes. I would highly suggest tightening the screw from the seat (C) into the back (A) as your final step. It pulls the seat somewhat out of alignment which makes the holes all misalign.Overall I\u2019m happy with the look and comfort. They fit nicely on the balcony where they replaced a larger set. They included two tools so as a team you could cut assembly down by about 30 - 45 mins depending on the luck of the draw with screw alignment.",

The cushions are actually comfortable as well. I enjoy sitting outside in the mornings drinking my hot tea and this helps so much! The table is big enough for drinks, decor, books, tablets or laptops. It\u2019s the perfect size! Everything came in perfect condition, no holes, and on time!",

                "reviewText": "We have a huge (30 feet long), but not wide (7 feet wide) porch. In a word, it's frustrating for decorating esp for function. We've had an outside dining table for a few yrs now that we were using big, clunky chairs for. It just wasn't working. I purchased two of these sets. I didn't need the tables, although cute, but the chairs seemed perfect. They absolutely are! They match the wicker in my existing table and are small enough to fit with my table and do so comfortably on my porch. My husband was able to put them together with ease (trick is you don't tighten in all the bolts until chair is together). We had one chair part to one chair that was broken and this seller was FANTASTIC to work with! Within a cpl of days, they shipped us the replacement part. Thank you so much! We use the two mini tables for some plants further down our porch and they're cute and functional and also fit well in small spaces. You can't go wrong with this set!For anyone wondering, my table is 26 inches from ground to (bottom) top. The chairs are 18 inches from ground to top of cushion and when seated to eat or relax, one is more than comfy. I have quite an ample behind and am not a small girl. The chairs fit me and are sturdy enough. For my own taste, I will most likely purchase thicker seating cushions, but that's only because like I said, I've an ample bum. ;-) The chairs are plenty comfy.Thanks for a great purchase and for the excellent customer service! We will look to your shop for further purchases.",

The cushions are thin and come out of the box with some flat spots, I think they will work themselves out.As for the packaging, Charlie may not surf, but he sure knows how to fit some furniture in the smallest box possible. I can't believe the 3 pieces all came out of that one box.Feels sturdy for smaller chairs at this price point, hopefully it holds up in a Lanai.",
