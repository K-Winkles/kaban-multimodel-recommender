These lanterns add a warm and welcoming ambiance to my outdoor space, and they are so easy to install. I hang them along my pathway, and they beautifully light up the way at night.What I love most is that they operate on solar energy. I no longer have to worry about electrical wires or changing batteries. They automatically charge during the day and turn on automatically at dusk. It's truly convenient and cost-effective.In terms of design, these lanterns are made of metal, giving them an elegant and rustic touch. They seamlessly blend with my outdoor decor and add a charming accent to my garden.There is just a small flaw: sometimes they don't fully light up on cloudy nights. However, it doesn't affect their overall performance.Overall, I am highly satisfied with my purchase. The set of 2 outdoor solar is a fantastic addition to my garden. They create a pleasant ambiance, are environmentally friendly, and easy to use.I highly recommend them to anyone looking to illuminate their outdoor space with both style and convenience.",
