The metal housing of the base and pole are a little flimsy as is the top reflector. Not heavy material and I doubt it is stainless steel under the color paint. We\u2019ll see how it holds up over the winter outside. This replaced a very well built all stainless steel unit that was over ten years old and looked new although the burner unit wouldnt light.

I had purchased it for a holiday party and put it together about a week before the party, only to find that the propane valve did not work, and was actually quite dangerous. When you push the valve down to light the pilot, the whole thing Explodes into a fireball because instead of triggering the pilot, it triggers the valve on high. I tried multiple times, and multiple different people to rectify the situation, and the valve was indeed defective. I contacted the company because there was no option to return it to Amazon, and the only options the company gave me were a credit to PayPal or an Amazon credit. Would not recommend this product or purchase again. Unless I want to be injured or burnt.",
