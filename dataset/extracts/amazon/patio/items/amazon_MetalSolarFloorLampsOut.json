                "reviewText": "I was looking for something like this for my apartment patio and I love them! The light itself is bright and pretty. They\u2019re smaller than I expected but it ended up being ideal for my space and perfect for what I needed- but if you\u2019re looking for something larger just be mindful of this. The plant holder holds a small planer with a plant that isn\u2019t going to grow too large. They\u2019re super easy to put together which I also love because I hate assembling stuff lol.One of them did show up broken (the attachment for the plant holder was broken) but they\u2019ve got incredible customer service and sent me a replacement that arrived the very next day after I messaged them about it. I always appreciate sellers with amazing customer service and I would definitely recommend this product/store. Thank you!",

                "reviewText": "These lights work so well that I purchased an additional 3 sets. They have been out in the rainy weather, and so far they work very well. I recommend that you charge the the light heads (the tops with the solar cells) at least 10 hours. To do this take the solar light tops out of the box. Next place them in the bright sun with the solar cells facing the Sun. Make sure that the power switch is in the ON position. The solar batteries will NOT charge if the switch is in the OFF position. Well before the sun sets turn the power switch to off. Next day repeat the same steps as you did the day before. At the end of day you can install the solar light top into the fixture. By preforming the above this will insure that the batteries in the solar light are full to their maximum charge. My fixtures stay bright for about 6 to 7 hours depending upon the brightness of the sun and hours of sunlight. In all I am rather impressed. Just a note I am not the easiest person to impress. P.s. keep the fixtures in the bright sun for best results. Art",

It must be the lighting from the photos that makes it appear brighter than it . I was expecting more of a fluorescent light. It's soft and dull like a 25 watt bulb light. I waited to see how bright they would become, the darker it became outside.Again, just OK to add style with a little functionality in my opinion.",
