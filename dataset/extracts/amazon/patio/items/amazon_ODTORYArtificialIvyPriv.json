One set of vines wasn't enough because their camera was able to bypass the gaps in it, so I put a patio a curtain behind one set as a base, and know I finally got the privacy I need.The vines are beautiful and light weight if you are using them for privacy you will need 2 to create a double layer. Or, stick to one and apply a mesh, fabric or curtain behind it to make it more opaque and fill in the gaps. If you get green, it will give it a cohesive look, or you can get it the same color as the fence or area you are applying the vines.The vines are in these square sections so you can break them off and snap them back together to get the length and width you want, it also comes with green ties for more security,I had to hang these in a unique way to create my own privacy barrier, so I hung these on my patio with S hooks, gorilla tape and a few nails at the end. They held up well even with strong wind.",
