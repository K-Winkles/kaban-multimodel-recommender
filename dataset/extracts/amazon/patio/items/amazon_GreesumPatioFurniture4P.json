                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to purchase because of several reviews and issues about assembly, mainly because the screws didn\u2019t align. There is very little that is worse with a product that gives you grief when assembling because of quality issues. I had no real problems with alignment. I learned a long time ago to hand tighten until complete, unless you have no choice. The slot where the screw enters gives a little, so that\u2019s an indication right there not to drive the screw all the way home because you might need to make adjustments. I\u2019m not saying this had anything to do with the issues people complained about, but it\u2019s a good practice to adopt during assembly, where possible. I did notice where the holes with the female threads were located had loose rattan, which wasn\u2019t due to poor craftsmanship, but to allow room for the screw to pass. It is wrapped differently in theses areas. Again, I\u2019m not saying this is how it was for those who commented about unraveling, just what my experience was. Assembly is much better, easier and faster with 2 people, especially when you need to help the pieces align. In the end, for the money, you can\u2019t beat this product. It is a little in the small side, but I am 5\u201911, 230 lbs and I sit/fit comfortably. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s durable, but after it\u2019s first use I\u2019m so satisfied that I\u2019m going to order another set for the other side. The cushions are a little on the thin side, but even without the cushions they\u2019re fine. After seeing and using this,?I liked it so much that I bought another set. I should have did this years ago. It\u2019s like having another room.",

The box says in bold letter that is it Fragile and the delivery girl literally threw it on our step. The box was super destroyed. It didn\u2019t seem to impact our product too much but concerning since there is glass inside. Assembly was difficult but not too terrible. A lot of the reviews said it was too small, so I attached a pic of my 90 on pitbull lab laying on it to show it\u2019s not that bad. We have a smaller deck so this was absolutely perfect for us. The seat cushions do seem to hold water but we have found bringing them in if we knows it\u2019s gonna rain just makes it easier. These are also replaceable. We love this set for the money we paid for it!",

                "reviewText": "What probably should have been an hour-long job to assemble took me almost 4. The instructions were easy enough and finding the pieces were fine. My biggest challenge was some of the screws were far more difficult to tighten than others. While some went in easy, in less than a few minutes others took at least 20-30 minutes. I had one that I had to take out and replace but it still would not go in. Also the legs on the table were uneven. Not sure how as that was the simplest assembly of all. Overall the set does fit nicely on my small front porch. I am not sure if it will last for years, but it will work for right now until I can upgrade to something more permanent. Just waiting to get the funds to redo my front deck before investing more right now. In the end, it works and makes the porch lot nice and organized.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This patio set is exactly what I was looking for. I purchased it for my mom around mother\u2019s day as a gift and it\u2019s now the end of September. The furniture held up pretty good.Took me about 2 hours to put together. I had to call my sister to help me finish. The instructions were helpful but telling the pieces apart from each other was a bit difficult.Tip: Certain pieces belong on certain sides (left and right) but the instructions did not specify that. I had to take apart a chair due to the unclear instructions. [some pieces are slightly curved to help decipher which pieces belong on which side] Unfortunately I learned that the hard way.The furniture is great for short term use, I find that sitting in the seats for too long is a bit uncomfortable. (may purchase more comfortable patio cushions)Major downside was the shipping. The package came about 2 weeks late with no warning therefore I reported this to amazon because I was afraid I paid for a product that I would never receive. Amazon was super helpful and polite and apologized for the sellers mistake and even refunded me in full.Apparently the seller only sent a shipping label to amazon without the actual patio furniture. which caused the delay in shipping. I\u2019ve been purchasing amazon shipped products only ever since to avoid the hassle.Overall the patio furniture is beautiful and it completed my mother\u2019s day gift as you can see it came together beautifully & my mom loves it!",

                "reviewText": "This set looks better as a picture. First of all the box that it came in was destroyed in transit. So it was falling apart prior to me even opening it. Second I went to put it together and the instructions remind me of ikea instructions. The pieces of the patio furniture just removing them from the box was already falling apart. So I could imagine how soon I\u2019d have to replace this set just from being outside. Trying to put it together the holes didn\u2019t line up for it to be put together. The ones that I was able to get screwed together it ended up stripping the bolt so it was hard to take off since I ended up just returning it. Huge waste of time and money and to make it worse to refund it you have To carry it back to the UPS store and make sure you print off the slip cuz you\u2019ll need that too and haul it into the store. Do yourself a favor and don\u2019t order this. It\u2019s not big at all for a normal sized adult and I\u2019d tether do ikea furniture cuz at least then I can put the bolts in the holes and don\u2019t have to worry about trying to fit something into a small ass space or trying to pull/push to make the bolt go in. 10/10 DONT RECOMMEND!",
