They charge up great in summer, last a while even after I go to bed which is great. They definitely don't charge as well in the winter as there is less sun time. They only last a couple hours if that in winter. Overall though, great value and I am out more in the summer anyway so great purchase. Easy to connect to deck with adhesive or screws.",

                "reviewText": "Living out a ways from the city, it gets extremely dark at night. I've tried numerous other expensive solar step lights but they never were bright enough to make a difference...until now. We just got these yesterday in the evening and right out of the box, the lights already worked and were extremely bright. We set them out in different places around the yard but since it was dusk and cloudy, didn't think they'd charge up much or stay on for very long after it got dark. We were wrong. Despite the minimal charge, these all stayed lit for at least 6 hours before we went to bed. I'm extremely impressed with how much light these lights give off, despite their diminutive size. Also impressed by the efficient shape of the light and the hardware that came with the lights. In fact, I was so impressed with these lights that I even bought more today!",

They come with a 2 year warranty, so we contacted Audles, and they immediately sent a replacement. So not only is the product wonderful, so is the company!",

                "reviewText": "It is winter and there isn't a ton of sun, but they don't last too long. I assume some of their batteries are bad from sitting on a shelf because half of them hold a charge longer than the other half. I bought them to light the stairs for some rescue dogs that needed to learn how to do stairs. They do light the stairs bright enough so I can see where to step. I didn't have to actually install them, they're just sitting on the stairs. I didn't think about the fact it is winter, so it is dark in the morning too and they definitely are not still lit in the morning. I think the worst of them last about 2-3 hours before they go out.",
