                "reviewText": "Bought 2 of these and are enjoying them on our patio. They are easy to move, start and operate and give off a good amount of heat.The assembly was a bit tricky, they have some good ideas for their assembly but poor implementation of those ideas. Good Idea: Segregate parts into groups of parts that are associated with an assembly step (e.g. a set of parts would be labeled 'Step 3'); Poor implementation: Step numbers on packaging often did not match up with the step number in the instructions. Also, there were a couple of times they noted that the hardware would be found already in the part and they were not.Other issue was lack of parts fitting together snuggly in the alignment needed for unit to stand straight. You assemble different sections of the tower and you have to manually, as you tighten several bolts, make sure that the pieces are indeed plum to each other. Our first unit unfortunately stands at a slight angle instead of straight up. Not sure if others notice, but I sure do. May eventually try to reassemble.With the learning from the first unit the second unit went together quite quickly and stands straight up.Overall happy with the units after 1 month of use. It could have earned 5 stars except for the above 2 issues.",

                "reviewText": "My father bought this for my husband and I for Christmas. It is soo cold that I asked for it early. So 2 months after the purchase, I got the heater. I was assembling it but the pole seemed unstable once i put the heavy heating element on top. It was tipping to one side and you could move it easily. I reached out to the customer service email that comes on the nice booklet that came with the heater. I explained my situation, that this was a gift and the purchase information didn't have my information on it. All they asked for was the amazon receipt. I got that from my dad and they instantly sent out a replacement part for the base of the pole. They followed up to make sure I received the part. Then they followed up to make sure the part fixed my problem!! It was amazing customer service! And they were timely too! Soo friendly!!This heater works great! We use it for outdoor company on our porch. My husband is a smoker and likes to hang out outside and this keeps him warm. I highly recommend this heater. The customer service is a high bonus 100%. Make sure you register for the free warranty!!",
