                "reviewText": "It took me a while to figure out the touch display. You touch the power button to cycle up through the power levels and it goes to the top and the turns off (wraps around to the bottom to start over). I thought there was some way to go up and down, but nope. It's just up.I like the remote as well - super useful when you have it crazy hot and it gets crazy hot.It will pop a circuit breaker if shared with anything with a decent draw, so be sure to give it it's own 15 amps if you can (or keep it at lower levels) so you don't have to hunt down the circuit box and flip it back on.Also, it's radiation style only. It's like one of those old ones that looks like half a toaster, but instead of short and wide, it's tall and thin. I put a fan behind it to slowly blow the heat across, but again be careful of power draw.It says indoor, but it doesn't really feel like something you want indoor. Maybe in a pinch, but you at least want a fan if indoor.The \"assembly\" was pretty easy except the guard rail, that was weird. It's still weird, kind of loose and feels like an afterthought, poorly designed. But I'm glad it's there.It's also not super hot - it will warm a small area on high if it isn't too cold and little wind, but it's not like one of those big restaurant ones that heats up a whole table on a patio.Overall, solid product and feels like it will last a long time, but it was over $100 at order time, and at that price I just can't give it 5 stars. I almost gave it 3 stars. It's worth $50 or $60 maybe.",

                "reviewText": "This heater is described as an \"Outdoor\" heater. That's because it heats with radiant energy that warms people and objects in front of it rather than heating the air by convection. The directions make me wonder about the outdoor designation. They specifically say this is not intended for use in bathrooms, laundry rooms, or other wet areas. This is designed for 'dry' outdoor areas. Assembly is straightforward, just two screws into the base.I set this up on our patio and turned the heat level to high. It drew a full 15 amps from the outlet, so this has to be on a circuit by itself -- it can't have other devices drawing current, or it will trip the circuit breaker. I felt no significant heating until I got within 6 feet of the heater. Sitting more than 8 feet away from it, I didn't feel any heat at all. So, this is different from the typical propane radiant heaters that are effective at heating people 10-12 ft away. The heater seems durable, and it's operated without issue so far. It doesn't really seem like this would be used inside a house; maybe it is better for a small workshop. The electric coils glow brightly, like a toaster, and they aren't safe around kids who might wander too close or put their fingers into the hot coils.",

                "reviewText": "This seems to work pretty darn good. Had it turned on out in the garage yesterday during a chilly day. It lit up pretty fast (although it didn't spew out fire like the illustration here. Sad... ) I only had it up about half way -- level 4 -- and it did a decent job while I worked out there. I probably should have went full tilt with it (if only to see it blasting that fire out) but I did not. That day will come soon, though. I like that it has a remote to use away from it and that it has a safety bar so no one can stand close enough to it and catch on fire. That's probably a good safety measure. Good deal.",
