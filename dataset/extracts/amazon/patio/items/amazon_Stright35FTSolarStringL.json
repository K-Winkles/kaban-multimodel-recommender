But I programmed the remote to level them out. Now, every nightfall I get the beautiful entry you see in the picture. The bulbs may be plastic, but they look like glass.

I have other string lights on the sides of these lights and they work fine. I am returning these lights and will find another set.Update. I was able to get them working by adjusting the mode on the back of the solar charging panel. The remote doesn\u2019t work ( at least not for me). So now the lights have gone on the past 4 nights and look good. We will see how they last. I would raise to 3 1/2 stars.",
