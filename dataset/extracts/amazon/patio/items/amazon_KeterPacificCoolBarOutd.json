                "reviewText": "This table is fantastic and looks great! Plus it did was it promises - kept beer and wine cold! I ordered the grey version - and it arrived the next day! Super fast service! The color is a charcoal grey. One reviewer said it looks brown, but mine is definitely the correct color and coordinates nicely with my grey wicker patio furniture. Assembly is easy but read the brief instructions. Some reviewers said it leaked - the instructions tell you how to adjust the drainage plug. Mine did not leak, and in fact while some of the ice melted overnight (outdoor temps in the 80s), the next morning everything in the cooler was still cold and there was plenty of ice left in it - my hand got very cold reaching in to unplug the drainage plug! I was impressed. The instructions also tell you how to keep the table top up (click it) and mine was fine, though I did tell guests not to \u201clean\u201d on the table top, just to be safe (says it holds up to 50 pounds but I was being cautious). Yes, there\u2019s a visible \u201cbolt\u201d in the center of the tabletop, however I put a round placemat on the table and put the glasses and napkins on it - looked great! Overall, I love this purchase! A great value, fun design, and a terrific addition to my patio parties!",

It's 2023 so get with the program, nice accessorie to have at the party. It holds lots of cans and bottles does a nice job of keeping things cold I like the table top you can open or close it. Lightweight, Strong, looks nice.Cons are requires lots of ice.That's the price of keeping things cold so no complaints plan to buy 2 more.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Happily, no damage to the contents inside",
                "reviewText": "Received this product on time through Amazon Prime. Was in original box, with no tape or seal over box flaps. Flap was partially open, and when lifting box entire lid opened. Happily, no damage to the contents inside, but can definitely see this causing some scratches damage if all are deliverd in this manner.As for the item, very pleased. It's not huge, but it's just the right size for my use, which is to sub as a side table b/t two wicker chairs on my enclosed porch. Exact same level as the armrests so very convenient to set drinks on. Up close you can tell it's plastic, but still a good enough look not to draw attention. It does have a silver dollar size cap in the center of the table top which is where the telescoping arm is attached. I think it would have looked nicer if they had a brown cover that matched the rest of the top, but probably would have been something that would pop out and been lost anyway. The cooler section is very deep and can easily accomodate upright bottles of wine when in closed position (nice). It will easily hold 12 bottles of beer and a larger quantitiy if cans.It's two pieces. The base and then the cooler/top section which sits on top, and can be attached with 3 screws. I did not use screws as it is more convenient for me when I want to drain the water out of the top section. I simply lift the top section take it o/s or over the sink and pull the plug in the bottom. If you pick it up the bottom will most likely come unattached, but no issue with it when it's sitting.The telescoping arm lifts it about 12 inches higher. This is where it could improve. You have to lift the lid then reach down on the pole and turn a coupler to the lock position to get it to stay. Would have been easier if simply lift and turn the top, and it dropped down into a lock position. Then lift out of lock channel and turn again to return to original position. I think this could have also helped with the securing of the position. As it is now you can still turn the top of the table when it is in the up position. No problem if you go in the direction of the lock position, but if you go the opposite direction the coupler will come unlocked and the table will collapse. I could see this causing some issues if you have kids (and adult kids) out and about and they find out you can spin it.In the up position it's fairly sturdy. It is plastic so it does have a little wobble, but when you put the ice in that helps a little. However, ice does melt so just plan on living with it. Hasn't been enough to deter me from enjoying, and have not had any drinks topple.For me this is a great product with a few things I would change on the next version. It's not going to be the main cooler at a 20 person BBQ which it's not intended for, but for sitting on the back porch enjoying a few drinks with a few others, or for an additional cooler and drink table at that BBQ it can't be beat.Same as what David said",
