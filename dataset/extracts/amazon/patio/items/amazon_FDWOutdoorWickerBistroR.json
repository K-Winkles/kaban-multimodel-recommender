Fair enough. Seems sturdy once assembled. That may take some time since not everything is aligned and the work area is a bit awkward. But it can be done A hammer comes in handy to set the back and sides. I finally found a bit to match the Allen wrench and use in my multi bit screwdriver. I highly recommend using one. So all things considered, a decent buy for the use. I\u2019ll see how it holds up to the weather.",

                "reviewText": "Assembly seemed straight forward. It is not. Many holes were covered by the plastic I had to cut away to even find the screw hole. The bolts were difficult as all get out to put in most of the holes. The glass for the table is maybe good in theory but superfluous and the suction cups on the table top were so wonky, from shipping I guess, it isn\u2019t exactly tethered very well either. If you\u2019re looking to curse, argue with yourself, and question your own sanity - this is a great patio set for you. I went through all stages of grief putting it together. After all was said and done (2 hours btw) I\u2019m just glad it\u2019s over with. I\u2019ve assembled many pieces of furniture in my day but this one really was something special. The chairs size and comfort seem adequate. Are they sturdy though? I guess. Some bolts never truly felt \u201cI can\u2019t turn this bolt another turn\u201d tight and some were tight but kept turning even after it didn\u2019t make sense to be possible to keep turning. The padding isn\u2019t exactly thick but it\u2019s sufficient. I can\u2019t say I\u2019d recommend buying this, unless you\u2019re really up for a challenge. The price is right on the set for how they look, but it\u2019s in my \u2018never again\u2019 category. A freak windstorm could launch these off my patio and I would not buy it again. Well, maybe pre assembled\u2026 they are decent looking.",
