While the first two sets were a matte black metal finish with one joint, the third set was a completely different style (shiny black metal finish, multiple joints, different anchor). The seller was fantastic and replaced the mismatched set at no charge with the original style.The installation definitely takes some muscle to get the anchors into the ground, but once they are in, they are pretty sturdy. As long as you keep them spaced appropriately per the setup instructions, they are able to hold the lights firmly in place without any leaning or drooping. This was a great solution for integration of extra lighting and adding some ambience with minimal installation work.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these to hold up patio lights around my concrete patio. I was pleasantly surprised with how easy they are to put together and how sturdy they are. The poles offer various ways to be used. I selected the stakes in the ground. The instructions are clear, and the pieces fit very well. The stakes were long, and I used a mallet to get them flush to the ground. The poles have been up at least week and have survived strong winds and rain. I think they will come apart easily should I decide to put them away for Chicago winter. I will recommend these to the neighbors as well",

                "reviewText": "These aren't awful, but I had to re-engineer my approach with these posts for the type of string lights I was flying.The good: Easy to put together. The materials are for the most part sturdy and the pole mount prongs are well designed to hold the light strings in place. The posts are aesthetically pleasing.Room for improvement: As noted, I had to re-engineer my approach - I originally had planned to mount the posts on my deck. I deferred to pulling them off and using the ground stakes (my deck is just above ground level so it worked). The reason being - if you are installing heavy duty outdoor string lights, the foundational stabilization post is only usable with the ground stakes and not the hard mount base, for which there is only half inch screw in base. But even with the stabilization post you will need to space them fairly close together otherwise lights of this type will still cause and the posts to bow and the string to sag. mine are currently spaced about 7' apart so I am hoping that two more posts will address the issue. We'll see...",
