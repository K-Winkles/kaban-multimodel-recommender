                "reviewText": "These solar lights are amazing! I have had them almost a year and they are working great. I had 2 that didn't work when they arrived, but taking a screwdriver to them, a cord was loose and was easily fixed. When they get dirty, I clean them off with a wet rag. The ambiance they give is worth the price and effort, even my dog likes to go out at night and lay near them. I have them lighting up the backyard fence and highlighting several plants/trees in the front yard. They make coming home in the evening/night beautiful.Once they arrived and charged, I spent an evening playing around with the positioning, like 5-6 hours worth. Knee pads and a hand shovel to make a perfect home for each one. They have not moved in almost a year (yes, I used the spikes they come with). These have really added a special depth of beauty to the outside areas. The ones getting direct sunlight stay on all night and seem to turn off when the sun comes up.",

                "reviewText": "If they got a full charge, I think the look of them is very unique compared to other solar lights because the disc and puck design gives a hard wire, professional feel- with that said, they only stay lit up for may be a few hours and then, by the end of the night, or as the night goes on, they get dimmer and dimmer until the sun comes up , but when it gets dark, they are quite bright. They have also stayed in place with the inground prongs so that is a plus.",
