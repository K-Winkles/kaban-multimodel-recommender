We are so glad we did, as it is the perfect table top fire for romantic dinners or even in the living room while watching Netflix. We don\u2019t have a fireplace and while electric fireplaces are nice, having this open flame is perfect! Gives off good warmth and makes a room feel cozy. Highly recommend using 70% isopropyl alcohol, which will last over an hour for just under 1 cup worth (~210ml). Price is perfect for the quality you get. 10/10 recommend!",

Perfect tabletop decor-flame manageable and plexiglass sides gave a sense of safety for kids using them. Definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't expecting much from this inexpensive little table-top firepit, but it turned out to be really nice! For the price, you just can't beat it.Although it doesn't put out a ton of heat, you can definitely feel it, and it looks nice too; we have it out on our screened patio, and while we use our large LP firepit when we have company, this little one is nice for everyday use. It's great to use for the cooler nights we have here in the desert, giving off just enough heat to take the chill off.I'm using 70% rubbing alcohol for fuel, and it seems to work just fine. I read other reviews that said it didn't burn very long, but mine was still going strong after 1-1/2 hrs, till I extinguished it with the tamper tool that came with it.My only (small) complaint is that the directions weren't very good. I wasn't sure how much fuel to put in (all the way to the top?) and if the wick should be sticking up out of the fuel.... But I filled it all the way and pulled up an edge of the wick to light it, and that seemed to work well. Also, it would have been nice if it came with a couple extra wicks; I'm not sure how long they last, but the refills for it cost more than the unit did!All-in-all, a fun little firepit and good value for the money!",

They catch on fire easily and quickly if you are not careful.- Once you fill it and light it, you are only supposed to use it until the fluid is gone or you decide to put it out. You are not supposed to add more fluid until you put it out and let it cool down. You could cause a disaster if you try and add fluid while it is hot or lit. So you can't keep it running continuously.- We used 91% isopropyl alcohol and filled it to the max fill line. It burned for over 40 min before we put it out. There were 6 or 7 of us sitting at the table and this was in the center. It was noticeably warm/hot.",
