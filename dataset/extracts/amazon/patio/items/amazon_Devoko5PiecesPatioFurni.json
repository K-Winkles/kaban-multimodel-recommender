                "reviewText": "I hesitated for weeks over buying this outdoor sectional due to the mixed reviews. My main concerns were the reviews slamming the set for being so poorly made that it was extremely difficult to put together and those complaining about the shipping. I am glad I took the chance and ordered it, as neither critiques were valid on the set I received.First, a lot of people complained about how long shipping took and that when it was received, only part of the set was received. I don't know if the seller changed the way they ship these, but in my case, the sectional shipped from a warehouse in Georgia via FedEx, and it was received earlier than promised. Yes, it was received in 2 separate deliveries 2 days apart, but the box clearly stated that it was being shipped in multiple shipments. Also, I contacted the seller after receiving the 1st box, and was advised in less than 12 hours that the 2nd box had also shipped and was given the tracking info. A+ for customer service.Next, with regard to those complaining about how difficult it was to put together, that was not my experience. It was pretty straightforward with the pieces assembling with a bolts and an Allen wrench. Yes, such a wrench is annoying to use, but given the design of the furniture, there is no other way to design it so that it can be flat-packed for shipment and then assembled. For those complaining that the parts did not line up, I suspect that the problem for most of them was \"user error.\" When you are assembling any furniture, you NEVER tighten the screws until the entire piece is assembled. Then, you go back and tighten everything up. This allows you to have enough movement to start all of the fasteners in their holes. If you tighten each screw as you go, then there is not enough flex to get the screws in on other sides of the piece.As to the quality of the sectional itself, I have to agree with other reviews that for the price, it is absolutely a 5-star product. Does it compare to a $2,000 set that you would buy at a high-end store? Of course not. But this only costs about $400. For that price, the quality is great. The set looks beautiful. The cushions are a little thinner and not as firm as I would like, but excellent for the price. It is comfortable enough. The only cons are: (1) the height, and (2) the movement. Specifically, the seats are a little too low at about 12\" before adding the cushions. I plan to address this issue by adding wooden (risers) feet to each piece to raise the seat up about 3\". As for the movement, this is pretty common with all sectionals. I note that Amazon sells clips separately to clip the pieces together. The clips are not expensive, and I will buy a set. But, I think they should be included in these sets (although this is true for all of these sets).As for durability, I can't really say as I have only had the set for week or so. We do not leave the cushions out in the weather as a general rule. If we aren't using them, we put the cushions away in the house or in a deck box. The resin wicker seems okay. We will keep the set under a pop-up canopy and put it in the shed for the winter, so hopefully it will last a while. From past experience, these outdoor wicker sets generally last 3-6 years, as the resin tends to break down in the sun/weather. But, again, for the price, I can't complain, and I don't expect it to last forever. The frame is all metal, and seems sturdy.Overall, my wife and I are very happy with this purchase. It is a great value, and the seller did a great job of shipping it quickly and responding to questions.",

Packaging was great on one box, the second box had damage and had started to mold inside the box but not on the furniture. My daughter (an adult) put it together with me, she did the majority and I'll say this...don't count on the directions included lol. The directions didn't make sense. We figured it out, if you go into the ad, there's a way to download a PDF and video but you gotta look around for it. Anyway... we did get it put together, took a little longer than we anticipated. Furniture is solid though. I'm a plus size gal and I'm comfortable on it. It was a good size for our tiny porch. The fabric cushions are fine but keeping in mind, you get what you pay for. I like too, that on windy days we can kinda stack it all together and bungee the cushions down. I think the price was great, shipping was fast and customer service was really quick to respond about the mold on box and offered a solution that I was happy with. (The cushions in the moldy box did smell but were not moldy, the smell went away)",

                "reviewText": "I really love this set. I\u2019ve been looking for what seems like forever for something similar but in my price range, and this is it! The assembly took a bit of time but was really straightforward. The furniture is pretty comfortable and feels really sturdy. It\u2019s very light in weight so we can move it however we need to, as often as we want. The cushions are a bit firm, but I don\u2019t mind. The cushions do have a tendency to slide around due to having a more slick fabric, but I got one of those grippy sheet things (I don\u2019t know the product name) that you\u2019d typically put in a kitchen drawer or something similar, to put under the cushions and they seem to stay in place well now.I\u2019m not one bit disappointed in this, and it\u2019s helping me get outside more and enjoy the lovely weather & fresh air!If you\u2019re on the fence about purchasing this, run \u2014 don\u2019t walk!",
