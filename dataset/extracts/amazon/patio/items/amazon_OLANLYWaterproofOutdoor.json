                "reviewText": "I ordered this Outdoor Rug for my patio. I placed it in front of my sliding glass doors. The rug is made of woven recycled plastic straws which makes it eco-friendly. The material is dense yet allows liquid to seep through while solids remain on top, which makes it easy to rinse off or sweep clean. The ease of cleaning is a great feature especially if you have pets who love to make a mess. The reversible design of the rug has modern geometric patterns on both sides and I love the black and gray color which is classic and stylish. The rug is coated with UV protection that guards against fading so the colors remain vivid. The reinforced edges prevent the rug from unraveling and make it withstand frequent use. The fused hems add to the durability of the rug. I have been using it for over a month now, and it is holding up well in the winter weather along with my three dogs running over it several times a day. Overall, I like this outdoor rug, the only thing that could be better is the price. It is a bit more expensive than I would like to spend, but if it lasts for years, it will definitely be worth it in the long run.",

In the past I\u2019ve used outdoor rugs, that weren\u2019t exactly \u2018outdoor\u2019 with more a fabric versus this one.The design aspect is pretty cool and modern in black and white, easily complimenting some of my existing pieces.Lightweight with a plastic straw type weave. Makes these entirely waterproof which is a great option as we tend to get some harder rains that will come in my back lanai area.Mine is kept on my covered, screened in lanai. However I could easily see this being great for traveling in a RV or camping or used on a day out with picnic. The weave makes for simple folding into a relatively small space, lightweight enough to carry without issue.While it\u2019s not the softest rug obviously. It does as intended. I\u2019d made well and I feel like this should last a couple season. Priced fair making this a good value.",

                "reviewText": "This rug could be used anywhere, but it's most at home on a porch or outdoor space, as it is the weather proof nature of the plastic straw that makes it special. I don't think I'd take this to the beach, though, as once sand gets in the weave it would have to be a beach only rug. We will be using it on an outdoor porch and when the storms blow rain in there's nothing to worry about. It came neatly packed in a carry case, so it would be an option to use for picnicking, too. It's very light for a rug, but it still looks nice (not for the average living room, it's too casual for most homes. While it is reversible, the hems are folded under or up depending on which way you use it. I could see taking it in an RV for your outdoor seating area, it would work well for that. It's a versatile rug, and its strength is the weather proof nature of it combined with good looks.",

                "reviewText": "I love this outdoor rug, it is not only the perfect size but it is also very well made and has so many uses. So far it's been used in my flower garden area, but will store it away for the winter months and only use it during spring through fall when it's going to be nice out, just so I know it will last for a very long time. We will be using this for camping as well, this will make for a nice clean area while out camping. It's very easy to clean off just by spraying with a hose and maybe a little wiping on the really dirty areas, but this will help get rid of sand off of shoes and is very easy to shake out/off the dirt. You won't have to worry about dragging along a broom to keep it cleaned off, just give it a good shake and dirt be gone. I am very pleased with this outdoor rug!",

It doesn't stain and super easy to clean.",

It might work better if it was summer time, but being winter and freezing temps, it's just not wanting to flatten out very quickly. I am going to take it up, roll it, and put it in my gazebo, which warms up like a greenhouse with just a little sun. Other than the folds, I love the look of this on my front porch. The material is going to be easy to keep clean and can be hosed off if needed.",
