I recommend you keep looking.Other LED torch lights I've bought (both the pricey TomCare brand and misc non-brand ones) are about twice the size of these and stay lit all night (even after two years) after receiving less than direct sunlight during the day. These, however, lose power after 3-4 hours even when they are positioned to receive full sunlight. I tried turning them off for a couple sunny days to let them charge fully, and even then only got 5-ish hours of light from them.I can overlook the fact that they're smaller than my other torch lights because the dimensions are given in the description, so that oversight is on me, but the fact that they don't stay lit for very long under optimum conditions is truly disappointing.",

Das Licht ist wirklich sehr angenehm und l\u00e4sst sich sch\u00f6n von drinnen und drau\u00dfen betrachten, mit der entsprechenden zierblende in die richtige Richtung gedreht, macht es wirklich Spa\u00df und Fackeln zuzugucken.Eine wirklich gelungene und sch\u00f6ne Erg\u00e4nzung f\u00fcr den Balkon.Die Lichtausbeute bei uns ist nat\u00fcrlich auch hervorragend, ich kann mir vorstellen, dass die Fackel nicht ganz so viel Spa\u00df machen, wenn man nicht genug Sonnenlicht \u00fcber den Tag sammeln kann.",

Allerdings muss ich erw\u00e4hnen, dass das Erscheinungsbild der Fackeln am Tag etwas entt\u00e4uschend ist. Das Geh\u00e4use wirkt potth\u00e4sslich und sehr kitschig, was den Gesamteindruck mindert.Was die Solarleistung betrifft, funktionieren die Fackeln im Sommer sehr gut. Sie laden sich zuverl\u00e4ssig auf und leuchten die ganze Nacht \u00fcber. Allerdings bleibt abzuwarten, wie sie sich im Winter verhalten werden, da die Sonneneinstrahlung m\u00f6glicherweise reduziert ist.Trotz des gemischten Designs und des potenziellen Winterproblems, muss man den Effekt bei Nacht und den g\u00fcnstigen Preis der LED-Solarfackeln loben.
