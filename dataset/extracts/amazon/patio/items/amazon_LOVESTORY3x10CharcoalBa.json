Not too dark, and are semi transparent, so not a solid block of charcoal. Even tho semi transparent, you can\u2019t see through at all from the street. Purchased mine mostly to protect plants from the strong winds in my area. After 4 months, plants are happy, patio looks clean, and patio feels more private. So far very happy with these. Fair price too.",

                "reviewText": "My balcony used to hold an unused table set and some agave plants but I didn\u2019t use it much because it\u2019s so exposed to the elements and to nosy people as I\u2019m on a corner of a busy street. Then Covid hit and it became my patio garden. I lent a friend the table and chairs and am now growing all sorts of vegetables for the second year. Since my \u201cwork from home\u201d attire is mostly pjs and messy hair, I felt so exposed when gardening so I ordered a couple of these from Amazon. This one matched my balcony rails perfectly, was easy to install and I feel so much less exposed. It\u2019s not opaque by any means, you can still see through it, but at least it\u2019s more of an effort to stalk the PJ clad plant lady. I think it is helping with the crazy wind that hits my balcony and it\u2019s held up so far with sun and rain. It also just looks nice. My view was a beautiful oak tree but also a Texaco and a busy street. It is not flush to the floor so my squirrel visitors can also still come visit from the space underneath and I can easy sweep out there. For the price, definitely worth it! The only thing I would recommend is posting the length of the zip ties because I ended up ordering some thinking they might not be long enough but I used those anyway because they were black and matched better and actually shorter which was a better fit.",

It also doesn\u2019t fully obscure items behind it\u2014I can still see the doorknob, window sash, and body outline behind it from the street. The body\u2019s detail is sufficient for me to tell the type of clothing, but not the color, and if someone used this and expected to be completely private, they might catch a public indecency charge. With that said, I think it will work well with a false plant screen set up between it and the street, the value is good, and it was easy to install with the attached cable ties and some screws we had on hand.",
