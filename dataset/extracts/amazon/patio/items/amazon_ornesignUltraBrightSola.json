                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the ornesign Ultra Bright Solar Outdoor Light after reading all of the positive reviews and they are even more beautiful in person than originally described on Amazon. They accent the paths around our garden area perfectly and I really like how they shine in a much larger circular surface area. It adds a touch of class when viewing close up or from a distance.These lights have exceeded my expectations and I am going to buy more for my patio and deck behind the house! Simply put, the lighting is warm and quite welcoming!Upon arrival, when I opened the box and started to put the lights together, I was very impressed by how easily each solar unit assembled! And they seem to be very sturdy even though they are lightweight! Being lightweight is a huge advantage as these ornesign solar lights have replaced some older ones I had that were made of very heavy glass and metal. The older ones were heavy and cumbersome. These lights seem to be 100 times better and it was so easy to assemble and place them.About two hours after I placed the lights in the garden path, it began to get dark outside and these lights immediately lit up the area in a beautiful circular projection pattern. I've had them for a few weeks now and there have been no problems. They stay lit for hours and hours at night even after gloomy or rainy days with little sunlight.The price is great and I love how they take one AA battery, so I can easily replace them whenever they run out of juice. This is a really good product that added a nice touch to my home. It exceeded my expectations.",

They were charged already so worked immediately/first night. They are not as bright as the photos show, but they do provide enough light to brighten a pathway. The design they put down is also very pretty, but not quite as large as the product photos convey. If the sticks were longer the design would spread to a larger area... but I'm happy with them being about a foot/foot& a half in diameter :) I've only had them installed for 2 days and so far so good!",
