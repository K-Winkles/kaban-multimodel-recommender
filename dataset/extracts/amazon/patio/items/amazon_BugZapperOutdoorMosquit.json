                "reviewText": "I bought another brand of bug zapper and it was great but out of stock. I needed to deal with a second room so I bought a second zapper( this model). This one works too. I am getting rid of fungal gnats that are in my plants and normal traps don't work. Normal gnats can be trapped with apple cider vinegar traps. These gnats are smaller and live in dirt and don't go for cider traps. Tough bugs to get rid of.This zapper cuts down on the nuisance from them. I am using it indoors with no issue other than you have to clean up the ash. If you have these tiny black fungus gnats put hydrogen peroxide in the plant soil. It kills them without hurting the plant. Bottom line this bug zapper model works. It would be nicer if it had a longer cord and an on/off switch but it's reasonably priced. The tray on the bottom catches the ash and needs cleaned out once a week if it's still killing bugs.My unit arrived and I plugged it in and nothing. No light. I looked at the instructions and saw how the bulb can be replaced. (New bulbs are 10 bucks on Amazon.) My units bulb had fallen out of the 4 pin socket. I simply pushed the bulb back in the socket, plugged the zapper back into the outlet, and it worked. 2 mins to fix it. Which also means it will be easy to replace the bulb later on. Nice.This model is good and I do recommend it. I removed one star because the power cord is too short and the lack of an on/off switch. It's still a great product. Just incase they do get more stock of the better model here is the Amazon link:Adjrp Bug Zapper Outdoor Indoor, 30W & 4200V Powerful Fly Traps Outdoor, Fly Zapper Outdoor for Bugs Mosquitoes Gnats, Effective Mosquito Zapper for Patio Backyard and Home https://a.co/d/aupUhN9Either zapper works great. No issues. Recommend either one.",

                "reviewText": "Works just like it should. Attracts and then zaps the bugs. Have been using this in our living room for the past several months and it still works great. We can hear the zap of the bugs every now and then and our house has pretty much been bug free since we got this. Super happy with this. Nice, small, compact size perfect for doing the job but not being too intrusive.",
