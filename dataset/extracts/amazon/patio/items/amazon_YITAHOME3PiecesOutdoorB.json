Ive only had them for a few months and try to take the cushions in when we aren't using them, but forget sometimes. Overall the cushions aren't dirty yet. We have to cats that like to hang out on them as well and its pretty easy to wipe off the dirt and cat hair.It seemed like too much of a pain to request a new leg for the table otherwise we would have. I didn't actually try so I could be wrong on this.",
