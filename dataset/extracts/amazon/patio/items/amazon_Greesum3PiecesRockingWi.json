                "reviewText": "Received this product and it was very well packaged. Each part was wrapped with plastic to prevent scratching. The hardware was attached and clearly marked on the box so it was not lost. The directions were pretty simple and easy to follow, the only critic I have is you have to be careful in what way you attached each part together because it may be the wrong way. There isn\u2019t a clear picture to decipher what direction. So a bit of problem solving. The end product was beautiful and very comfortable. I weigh 180 at 5,4 and I could comfortable cross my legs and relax. The table is very nice with a glass top finish. I would give it a 4.9/5 just because directions weren\u2019t super clear, but overall great product",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. After wanting rocking chairs for so long I spent a long time searching for a set that was affordable, nice looking, and easy to assemble.Since I didn\u2019t want to wait for my husband\u2019s help, I decided to assemble it myself. It took me a solid hour because I screwed some parts backwards \ud83d\ude02\u2026 anyways, assemble was pretty easy. Just make sure to account for all parts before starting and tight the bolts evenly. Like, don\u2019t make one tight while the others are lose while assembling. It will be more difficult to align the other screws/holes and the panels won\u2019t fit.The issues I had was that some of the screws were damaged and they didn\u2019t go all the way trough. I went to Home Depot and bought replacements because I wasn\u2019t going to disassemble anything at that point! \ud83d\ude05\ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8 I called costumer service and they gave me a partial refund for the hassle! The bottom cushions have zippers, but the top ones don\u2019t. The cushions do not have a string to tie them to the chair so they\u2019ll blow away, and they\u2019re not supper thick. I did find some strings of similar color and sewed it. Problem solved.Overall, I\u2019m really pleased with the whole set! It\u2019s sitting in a covered porch, so let\u2019s see how it does when it rains. The manufacturer should add spare bolts and screws.",

The seats are deep and comfortable. The pads are very thin and low quality but not a reason not to buy this set. I gave 4 stars because the plastic weaving is not very quality, but for the price it is exactly what I expected. I will probably have to rework it next year with a better quality strap, but that is something I enjoy doing. The frame is sturdy and that is what matters.",
