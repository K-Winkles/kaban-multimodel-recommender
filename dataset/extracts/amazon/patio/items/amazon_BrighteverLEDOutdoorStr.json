You just need to hold the middle part of these string lights with one hand and straighten the strings out with the other hand. (starting from the plug) 2. Please tighten all connecting parts to ensure a proper operation. If single or a few light bulbs do not work, it's probably caused by disconnection between the small copper inside the socket and the light bulb base. In this case, you can use a stick or other tools to bring the copper out a little so it can reconnect with light bulb base.",

                "reviewText": "When you need to transform a space and create a warm, inviting atmosphere, the right lighting can work wonders. That's precisely what the Brightever LED Outdoor String Lights did for us when we needed to light up a 20x40 canopy, making it a cozy and welcoming haven under the stars.We used five sets of these fantastic string lights to get the job done, and the result was nothing short of spectacular. The 52 Shatterproof ST38 Vintage Edison Bulbs emitted a warm 2700K glow that set the perfect mood for our outdoor gathering. The dimmable feature allowed us to adjust the brightness to our liking, ensuring that we had the right ambiance for any occasion.One of the most impressive aspects of these lights is their versatility. We were able to place them anywhere we desired, even in areas where power outlets were not accessible. This was a game-changer, allowing us to create an enchanting space in our canopy tent, without any limitations.To maximize their use, we found a clever solution. We used towels to cover the solar sensor during the evening transition, making it think it was darker than it really was. Once the night sky enveloped us, we could remove the towels, and the lights shone beautifully, enhancing the ambiance.In conclusion, the Brightever 100FT LED Outdoor String Lights are an absolute must-have for anyone looking to illuminate their outdoor spaces with elegance and charm. These lights are not only waterproof but also highly durable, making them perfect for a variety of settings. Whether you're hosting a gathering, a romantic dinner, or simply want to enjoy your outdoor space in the evening, these lights have got you covered.",

Will try adjusting the socket contacts, will update.**UpDate** Customer service is absolutely fantastic. Bulbs were faulty, and they worked with me to handle situation. Very happy, as they illuminate perfectly and am pleased with the quality of the lights overall. As a note to installation, we used a hanging kit, one with the coated wire, tensioners and zip ties along with anchor hooks to hang these. In addition, I placed a very small dot of dialectic grease (sometimes called \u2018bulb grease\u2019 in auto repair) on the tip of the bulbs I replaced to aid in weather resistance. Florida is humid, and it rains a bit - so I attribute that to the issue I ran into. As mentioned, supplier worked with me and I am thrilled with outcome. Everything works great.",

The bulbs are plastic, LED in the \"old time filament bulb\" appearance, but only about 2-\u00bd\" long and with candelabra bases - bright! Unwinding them and getting everything laid out for mounting is, frankly, a headache as the everything constantly re-tangles, partly because the wiring itself is rather stiff. Having handled them extensively during the unpacking and getting them strung, I'd say they're of a pretty durable construction. Now that they're up, they're beautiful at night and add useful illumination.",

We use them to line the 100 ft (or so) walk between the house and chicken coop, it's to do an after-dark check on them.",
