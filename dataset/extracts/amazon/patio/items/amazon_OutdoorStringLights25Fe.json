These lights transformed my backyard into a magical oasis. The soft, warm glow of the Edison bulbs created a cozy atmosphere that was perfect for hosting outdoor parties and gatherings. Plus, the fact that it came with 2 spare bulbs was a thoughtful touch, ensuring that the festivities wouldn't be interrupted by a burnt-out bulb. These lights are not only beautiful but also durable, thanks to their waterproof design. I couldn't be happier with my purchase, and they've become an essential part of my outdoor decor. No remote, only plug in, easy to break so I would suggest installing bulbs after you run the line.",

                "reviewText": "I must say, they have completely transformed my balcony! From the moment I unboxed them, I was impressed by the quality. The 25-foot length with 13 Edison-style plastic bulbs (plus a spare) seemed perfect for the space I had in mind.Installation was a breeze. I hung them up my balcony ceiling and the end result was nothing short of magical. The warm, inviting glow these lights emit has turned my ordinary balcony into a cozy retreat. It's like having a little piece of a fairy tale right outside my door.I was initially concerned about leaving them outside, but these lights have proven to be quite durable. They've withstood several rainy nights without any issues, thanks to their waterproof design. Plus, the fact that they're connectable means I can easily add more in the future if I decide to extend my little outdoor haven.One of the best parts? The ambiance they create during the evenings. Whether I'm hosting a small get-together or enjoying a quiet night alone, the soft illumination adds a special touch to every occasion. And with Christmas around the corner, I'm excited to see how they'll enhance my festive decorations.They are a fantastic buy. Not only do they look great, but they also offer reliability and versatility. If you're looking to add a bit of charm and warmth to your outdoor space, I can't recommend these lights enough. They've certainly made my balcony my new favorite spot at home!",

                "reviewText": "I've purchased four sets of these lights in the past and am writing this review as I purchase a 5th. For the price the look is great and brings some atmosphere to whichever space you use them in (I have some in my office, living room, back patio and front patio). For an occasional-use outside feature, it'll last a long time.However, if you aim to enjoy these lights on the daily then you should be prepared to continually replace the bulbs. We have one of these sets strung across our living room and turned on each night for 5-6 Hours - our heaviest use of this product. After about a month-ish of that usage so you'll have the first bulb go out and then see one or two burn out each month afterwards. For the look and price I've been happy to replace as they burn out, but it does eventually give you the feeling of \"I JUST replaced all the dead ones, now another is gone.\"Also, sometimes these bulbs burn extra bright when you switch them out - and if it does you should expect that particular bulb to burn out real quick. I also have seen some that appear \"burnt out\" which come back to life if you lightly tap on the bulb. Unfortunately, the reverse is true as well where I've bumped a working bulb while replacing one next to it and had it die on me. Ultimately the bulbs for these are finicky and not the longest lasting - but at least they're relatively cheap. If I could get the exact same look with LED bulbs instead I certainly would invest, but alas.As for durability over the longer term, the actual cord for the set of lights I put in my living room lasted about two years of heavy daily usage before last night it finally kicked the bucket. It's the only one of the 4 sets of these that has had the cord die.Ultimately great value for what you get, just anticipate some upkeep costs to keep the bright lights a-flowing.",

These lights work on 110V power so do not connect them directly to the socket because in India we have 230 - 240V power supply so please buy an adapter which converts 230V into 110V and provides power output more than 125W.Seller provided me an adapter which has an output of 65W which is not sufficient for these lights. I am sharing a link of an adapter which I am using and working great with these lights so go for this adapter blindly. You can buy it from here - https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B01DXOED2A/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",
