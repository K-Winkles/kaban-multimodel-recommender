                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A Recycling Hideaway",
                "reviewText": "These have turned out to be perfect for my household recycling. Most of the recycling bins I saw online weren't very inconspicuous and the size per price ratio was way more expensive at the time than using one of these. So I sold myself on getting some of these Hideaways for my recycling.They seemed a bit pricy at first, but I didn't see much price variation between similar items - or even between Amazon and my local home stores. I did purchase two of these at Home Depot during a daily deal sale. The ones from HD didn't have the wicker pattern at the top, but they are virtually the same otherwise. I think the wicker pattern is pretty and adds a bit more to look at than the plain containers I got from HD, but for the price I'd go with the cheapest I could find. The last one I purchased was from Amazon Warehouse (likely a return from someone) to save a few bucks. It was sold as used, but looked new minus a bit of dust.At first I was a bit worried when I unpacked these, because the material seems to be cheap and flimsy. However, once they are put together, they are pretty freaking solid. I really like the slide lock on the top (see the pictures for lock engaged vs unengaged). I lock the top part of the lid and lay them down when I transport to my recycling center to prevent spillage. If the whole lid locked, I'd love to transport them upright instead, but I'll take what I can get with these.The assembly is pretty straightforward, but the directions aren't exactly specific and none of the pieces are labeled (not that it is hard to identify them anyway). Start with the bottom, add the sides to the bottom snapping two sides parallel to each other until you have all four sides in, add the top, and you're done. The 'snapping' part of the assembly can be a bit of a challenge, but is completely doable if you have a little bit of strength or weight to leverage. I liked to push one side in and then use my weight to make sure the sides snapped together all the way and rotate the box as I snapped each panel together. The lid was the most trouble to snap on, as one of the pieces always seemed to be off a bit. Even with that little annoyance I had this thing assembled in under 15 minutes.I don't use any bags inside, so I haven't experienced the bag frustration that many people seem to have. If you plan on using this with bags, I suggest reading some of the reviews (one reviewer was kind enough to post a fix for a ripping issue). I do wish this had a better carrying method as it seems the only way to carry it without the lid popping off is to grab it from front to back, which can be a bit awkward for the height impaired. But, I'm not faulting it since I don't think it was meant to be transported the way I'm using it.Overall, I am really happy with these Hideaways. They are great for recycling. I'd buy again if I had a need for some more.",

It looks great and it\u2019s extremely functional the perfect size it does not look industrial, and instead fits very well in the decor of the home exterior. The price was very fair and we liked it so much. We ordered a second one if you were looking for a garbage that can to be used outdoors, especially with a lid that latches, keeping any of the insects and critters out, This is the one! Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "Details belowPROS:- sturdy as heck- look nice- easy to assemble- large capacity- pieces are marked for assemblyCONS:- make sure you have 6 (six) pieces BEFORE you assemble. Directions aren\u2019t necessary but once it\u2019s together that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no god way to get it apart without a saw or hammer.- no directions or parts chart which would\u2019ve been beneficial as it would\u2019ve listed the piece I was missing. The directions are helpful because there\u2019s a certain way to put the bottom in and a best order to do the sides, but you can do it without them if you just go slow and look at all the pieces first.- the latch for the larger lid (to put the bag in and out) isn\u2019t great so be careful when lifting. If the latch piece was just a tad bit longer it\u2019d be perfect. (The latch for the smaller top opening works perfectly fine).****I WANT TO REITERATE: ONCE YOU PUT ANY OF THE PIECES TOGETHER THEY ARE NOT COMING APART SO DONT MESS IT UP.****I ordered 2 - one for cans one for bottles. The first one we opened it didn\u2019t have directions, but they\u2019re so easy to put together. We opened the 2nd one and that had directions but also.... a bottom. The first one didn\u2019t come with a bottom. I was going to order a replacement part but once these babies are put together that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no taking it apart. SO I spoke with Supinder at Amazon CS and they\u2019re replacing it. It\u2019s still kind of usable but since there\u2019s no support at the bottom the bag would drag on the ground possibly rip open and there\u2019d be no support.It may also be a good idea to put cardboard inside as others have said. It\u2019s jot flat inside and does have the potential to rip the bag, depending on what bag you\u2019re using.Otherwise I LOVE these things. I have almost no issues with quality, it was easy to assemble, they looks nice and have a good capacity.",

My younger grandchildren are more inclined to use them because they like the lock top access, which definitely keeps unwanted pests out.

                "reviewText": "I was looking for something to put in the back yard so that the kids would have somewhere to put their garbage when enjoying the pool in the summer months. I wanted to make sure that garbage wouldn't blow everywhere so needed something that would contain it but wouldn't look like an eyesore.The Suncast Trash Hideaway showed up in my Amazon search and it looked like it would fit the bill. Once receiving and assembling it, this was confirmed.Assembly was so simple. There are instructions but they're hardly necessary. It is just six pieces and they snap together so quickly. No tools are required for assembly. Once snapped together, it is quite rigid and won't come apart easily.There is a lid with a latching mechanism that is quite simple to open. This is what you'd use when placing garbage in the unit. Then, for replacing a bag or emptying the unit, the entire top lid hinges open after you pull the release handle.It takes 30 - 33 gallon bags which are readily available. Once you see how it opens and closes, you can easily insert the bag and keep the excess hidden so the bag stays retained but you don't end up with the top of the bag overflowing the unit.Overall, a simple design that's quite effective and is a welcome addition to the back yard.",
