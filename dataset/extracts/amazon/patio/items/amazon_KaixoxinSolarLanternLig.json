                "reviewText": "I just received this lantern this evening and so it\u2019s working with whatever power was in the battery but it\u2019s so beautiful. Very lightweight and easy to hang. Looks beautiful hanging or setting on a surface. I would have concern about it blowing over in a storm if not secured to something. I\u2019ll add an update after I\u2019ve had a chance to observe charging and length of time the light stays lit at night.Edit: three years later and up until last week this lantern has been hanging from my patio roof this whole time looking beautiful and lighting up nightly. Even on cloudy days it would stay lit long into the night. Unfortunately, last week I noticed it wasn\u2019t lighting up anymore. I will be purchasing a replacement in hopes that I will get the same quality product. In my opinion three plus years is pretty good. Note: the spot it hangs in gets is the side of the house that get hit with direct sun in afternoon and evening as it\u2019s on the corner and usually gets hit with wind and sideways rain during storms. It\u2019s held up in some pretty extreme weather and was left out year round.",

One thing to keep in mind is they are small, so look at the measurements product dimensions before ordering, but just because they are small don\u2019t let that deter you from getting them. They are absolutely beautiful, they have a little hook to hang them from the shepherds hook to if you want to but I just have mine sitting on the ground and I also got the warranty for them for like six or seven dollars and they\u2019ll be good for three years this says or they\u2019ll replace them so totally worth the money. I absolutely love them. I love them so much I bought two more sets of them so I have six total.",
