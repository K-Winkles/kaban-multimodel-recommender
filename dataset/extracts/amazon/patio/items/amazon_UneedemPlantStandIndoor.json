Found these low cost shelves online and couldn't be happier.They are cheap and smaller than you'd expect (you may note I used crates to elevate them a bit in front of my window (it worked perfectly).The shelving is good enough quality to hold plants of different sizes and weights. It feels steady and should last the test of time.Assembly was straightforward once you get the hang of it. The mallet included was perfect and worked VERY WELL despite others saying it broke. I saved it to use on other projects. It looked me 23 mins to assemble the stand shelf from start to finish.I ended up ordering 3 more of them (they look great and made more space to buy more plants lol). I couldn't be more pleased.The gloves included are handy and kept my hands cleaned during assembly (as your hands will get dirty but it washes off easily). The tiny garden tools are cute but prob won't serve much of a purpose for me.I would recommend the stands but would recommend checking out the dimensions as it is smaller than it appears online.Overall I'm very pleased and would recommend and would big again. (I could almost use one of these for every window at my house \ud83d\ude48).",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. When redoing my plant room, I needed shelves that could hold numerous plants with differing heights, not have solid shelving, so as to let in light, fit into my space, and not be too expensive. I spent a long time checking measurements and configurations. I ended up getting four units from different companies, but they are all the same material, construction, and assembly. I guess they are made by the same company, but are from different distributors. Anyway, I am a super pleased with them all. They were easy to put together, have a nice look, are pretty sturdy, even with heavy pots, and are a good price. They are 12\" deep; which allows more floor space in a smaller room. I will post this review on all the sellers sites that I have bought these from, so they all have the same review.",

Easy to assemble, my 3, 5 & 9 ye old boys had fun helping assemble it! I'm new to plants and will more than likely purchase another! I love the little tools it came with, that was unexpected! Super sturdy if you hammer it just right!Only downside is that the gloves that were supposed to stop my hands from being stained actually stained my hands! Also careful you many get wood slivers while assembling through the gloves.",

                "reviewText": "I needed to get some plants off the floor but didn't want to spend the money on another metal shelf. I knew for $25 it wasn't going to be great quality. It took about 25 minutes to out together. A lot of the pieces were warped, twisted, or cut just a little too long so it took a lot of banging to get them connected. Most of the shelves were also warped. It does not sit flat on the floor so will probably need to wedge something under some of the legs. Even knowing the measurements when I ordered it, it is smaller than you would expect. Wear the gloves because your hands will get the carbon on them. Plus the gloves help with all of the splinters that came off of the pieces. You get what you pay for. It is ok for a quick setup when money is tight but not sure I would buy another one.",
