I ordered another box of lights and they all work so far so maybe my first order was an oddball. I would definitely buy from them again in the future since customer support was so helpful and nice.Received the lights on Saturday and installed them the following day on Sunday. Lights had all day Monday to charge under the sun. 3 don\u2019t work and 4 have a faint light compared to the others. 3+4=7 bad lights out of 16 lights is almost half. There\u2019s no support website and the 888 number doesn\u2019t work! VERY FRUSTRATING but I\u2019ll have to remove all lights just to return them.",

I thought perhaps I miss ordered, or got the wrong size.Visually, they seem simple, not super high end material; mostly plastic. I chose brown to blend in with the cinder wall I was putting them on. I sticky backed 8 of them to the wall over lunch with the included double sided tape. They look alright.This evening after our got dark I stepped outside to see how well they did. It\u2019s just the right amount of light. Enough to navigate safely, but muted enough not to glare or disturb the neighbors.Overall I would say good value for the price point. I will put up the rest tomorrow.Time will tell on the durability and longevity.",
