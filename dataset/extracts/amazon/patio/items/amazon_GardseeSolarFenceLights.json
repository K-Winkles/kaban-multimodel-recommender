                "reviewText": "Whelp, I paid 38.00 for something that looks like it came from a dollar store. They're made from cheap thin grade plastic that won't last a year outside. Second....the light bulb, no bigger than a dried water bead, is weak and so small it should be illegal to call it an LED light. It doesn't push light more than 2 inches away from the unit so, you can imagine how quick the image distorts into nothing. And 3rd....It displays the shadow BACKWARDS and is covered up by the unit itself. It's weird really. I would expect to be able to see the shadow on the ground or all around like in the pictures the seller shows but, that's not it at all. So, for a deck, these units are totally useless because you can't see anything due to the backward projection of the image. I had to hold it less than 3 inches from the ground to even see the image before we hung them up. But, alas, we hung them thinking they needed more time in the sun to display further but, nope. For the money, I'm VERY disappointed in this product. I'd say it's down right ridiculous to sell something this cheap, China made, for almost 40 bucks. Amazon is becoming polluted with this type of item. You see these great pictures of an expensive product yet, when it arrives it's a cheap knock-off made in China. AND you pay for the good stuff yet, get nothing more than junk. Grrrrrrr! Where can I shop and be able to trust I'm getting the real thing? Not Amazon anymore!!!!",

They came with a cheat sheet screw template for each one, so no guessing or measuring where to place the screws. A couple of mine were slightly covered by top board overhang, but they still charged. The set even came with one replacement solar \u201cpanel.\u201d These are some of my favorite solar lights.",
