Best mistake I ever made, we needed something to put down for my niece to play on and since we all brought sleeping bags and no one wanted to put theirs on the bare ground, I grabbed the rug. It was easy to wash off after she ate and played on it for hours. It isn\u2019t scratchy, was easy to fold back up, stayed cool in the hot sun, and the people on the campsite next to me even asked where I got it! It is now placed nicely under my patio set and compliments my set perfectly. My only complaint is that I didn\u2019t buy the biggest size!",

                "reviewText": "I used this product as an outdoor rug. I have a canopy I put up on my patio, I put this down to use as flooring because I wanted something nicer looking than the cement floor of my patio. Great choice , was much cheaper than outdoor carpet, and it doesn't mold or mildew because it's made out of waterproof material so when it rains it does not absorb water , the water runs right off. Looks beautiful as well! Highly recommend!",

The color was a different gray it was my first time buying an outdoor rug/mat so I wasn't sure what to expect in texture and feel of it. It had some cushion to it easy to fold and unfold. He was extremely light and easy to clean. I feel the look of it in the pictures has a better and nicer presentation of quality than in person. Overall I'm giving it five stars because the quality of it was good.",
