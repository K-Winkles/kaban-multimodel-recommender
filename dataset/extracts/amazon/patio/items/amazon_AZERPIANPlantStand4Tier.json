I love that the plant places are nice and flat and they are very steady. I really do not like the ones that are slatted, it makes it difficult to balance you pots if they do not have an even flat bottom; plus if its too small, balancing it on slatted ones is really challenging. Very happy with my purchase. I may even get another bigger one to replace the slatted one I have.",
