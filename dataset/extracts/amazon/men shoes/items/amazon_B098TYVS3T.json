Within a few months I noticed my feet getting slightly wet when there was any rain. A few months after that I was able to seethe top of the shoe coming undone from the soles. Also in trying to make these shoes more slip resistant the tread on them picks up all dirt, grass and leaves. I will not purchase any Dr Scholls shoes in the future.",
