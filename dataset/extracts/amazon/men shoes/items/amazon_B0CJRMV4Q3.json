                "reviewText": "I was a bit skeptical with these being rather cheap, but these boots are actually pretty good! They're made well, broke in nicely, and I haven't had any issues yet in my few months of owning them. There is no tread on the bottom though so it can be a bit slippery in icy weather. They also really smell of fake leather, which isn't bad of a smell but I could see if you were sensitive to smells it could be a bit overwhelming in certain situations. It goes away after owning them awhile though. Also when you click your heels together it sounds like two loud wood blocks smacking together, which randomly startles my friends and makes me laugh. That's a positive! I like them!",

The elastic side walls allow you to slip these comfy boots on. Keep in mind you will need to use your hands as these are boots and not slippers. The soles are leather and I think could be worn as any other shoe.",

Can probably be fixed with some shoe glue if needed",
