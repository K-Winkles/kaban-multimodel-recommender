I have been wearing them for a few days and I find them comfortable and look fairly nice. They are lightweight which I like, but they don't have much protection from the elements. If it's cold outside, you will feel it. That however does not matter to me. Also note that there is no traditional tongue which I thought was weird at first. But, once you tie them, you can slip them on and off which I really like. Overall I'm happy with these shoes and would buy them again.",

He walks 4-5 miles every day of the week, and his expensive brand sneakers only last him 4-5 months. He even says that some of them have been very uncomfortable, to walk with. So, he saw these on line and bought them to try them out. He\u2019s waiting to see how long they last. He claims that for the price he paid, even if they last the same as the other sneakers, he\u2019ll be ahead, because he paid 1/4 of the price he has paid for each of his prior sets of sneakers. Anyhow, it\u2019s fair to say that my husband is walking very happily with them. They are a bargain, and he\u2019s going to keep buying them, since they\u2019re very comfortable to walk with.",

They give adequate support and are comfortable for all-day wear. After 1 month of use they're holding up well with no signs of separation. Very pleased with this purchase !",

I love them...",
