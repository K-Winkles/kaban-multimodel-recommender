I like the look of them and use them regularly. For running I use \u201cbetter\u201d shoes from the same brand. These seem ok for running though - probably would be good for it also. The back of the shoe has a raised cushion that you have to make sure you don\u2019t squish down when you slip on the shoes, but if you do that, they are both tight and comfortable in a way that feels very solid. No squeak in these shoes so far - have had that problem with some other shoes recently. Overall, these are a great purchase for the price - definitely seems like much better quality than you typically find at their lower price point.",

I normally wear a size 8 to 8.5. I ordered an 8.5 thinking if they were a little loose I could wear thicker socks and wouldn't have to deal with returns. I received the shoes and from the first look they seemed small. I tried them on with thin socks and they were pretty tight. I returned the shoe, a very smooth process, and ordered a new pair of size 9s. I received these and they fit very nicely and are quite comfortable. I can't wait to start running in them.",
