                "reviewText": "These shoes were originally intended as a cheap pair of work shoes that could get dirty; however, once they arrived, I fell in love. They fit perfectly, were extremely comfortable despite my expectations, and seem very durable. I did end up wearing them to work for about a week but had to end up buying a second pair which I used for daily/personal use. They are easy to clean and maintain and are as durable and comfortable as much as they are attractive! Will continue to purchase these shoes as the price seems like a steal for what you get! Thank you!!!",

                "reviewText": "I tear shoes up fast and frequent, seemingly regardless of brand, make or price. Maybe I'm doing something wrong there but either way it results in me ordering shoes frequently and I settle for something fairly low priced and I hope that it's comfortable enough to walk around in. These fit that perfectly. Maybe a half size too big which is what it is, they are comfortable and lightweight, black with minimal design so they aren't flashy. Wear with anything and you're good. Probably not good in rain but most running shoes aren't unless they're specifically designed for it. The downside to my personal situation is the good shoes I find don't tend to stay around when the current ones break down. Considering buying a 2nd pair for the future to avoid that issue",

                "reviewText": "I like the upper shoe. Flexible and breathable. Fit was a little too roomy but then again my feet are on the narrow side. My biggest complaint is the soles. They provide very poor traction so if you\u2019ll be on damp grass or any slick surfaces it is not very secure. I rolled my ankles several times running before downgrading these to comfortable around-the-house shoes. But I wore them daily for about 6 weeks, maybe 50 miles (some road but most floor) and the soles were just worn down. Seems like a low density foam that is good for cushion and shock absorption but not good durability.",

I was looking for a pair of dog walking shoes, I did not want to be bothered with laces but didn't feel like paying the price for Kiziks or Skechers. These came in and when I put them on for the first time, they felt very comfortable, lightweight material that surround my ankle and easy to slip on and off, just using the laces the first time to adjust the fit. For the price, these can't be beat and I am sure that when this pair wears out, I will come back for a second.",
