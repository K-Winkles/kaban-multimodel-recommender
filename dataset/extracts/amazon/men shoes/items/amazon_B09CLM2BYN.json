                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been a road-jogger for 25 years, with some breaks here and there, and ASICS have been my shoe of choice for most of that time. They seem to fit my somewhat narrow feet better than other brands. I either run in a stability shoe or in a neutral model with a rigid insole since my feet overpronate moderately. My average weekly distance is 10-12 miles, so not a whole lot anymore.The GT-1000 11 isn\u2019t really all that different than the ASICS stability shoes I bought twenty years ago. There\u2019s a built-up area under the arch that keeps the foot from rolling inwards too much. When combined with a stiff heel counter and supportive upper, the effect is to ensure proper gait alignment. It works really well and is reliable.I like the fit on the 11th iteration of this shoe, which suits my slimmer feet well. My feet feel really locked-in. I would imagine wider-footed people would need to make sure to order a wide. I also love how light these shoes feel. They look heavier than they actually are. There is ample cushioning through the whole length of the shoe, but more at the heel which is great for heel-strikers like me. The stock insoles are thin and I may eventually replace them with Dr Scholls for added cushioning and to make my shoes last longer. These kicks also look cool, with bright colors that pop.All told, these GT-1000 shoes are absolutely superb for daily jogging and are a real value for their low cost. I very highly recommend them to any runner who is looking for some extra foot support. You really aren\u2019t going to find anything better at this price point. I hope ASICS keeps this model in their rotation for a very long time.",

                "reviewText": "I like ASICS shoes because the sizes are consistent, really important for buying online. I like buying online because I wear a size 14, often stores have nothing or very little selection in that size. My left foot overpronates, which causes the right rear corner of my left shoe to mash down, and the sole to wear thru. So I have to get a new pair even though the right shoe is still in good shape. I needed a new pair, and went to the ASICS website to look for shoes that might work better, and they have a selector where I could search for shoes that were good for overpronation. This shoe, the GT-1000 came up. I've had them for only a week, too soon to know for sure, but my initial impression is these are going to help. The midsole is a firmer material, so hopefully it will not mash down and exacerbate the inward tilt of my foot. Besides that, the shoe is comfortable and well-made. The top is a very thin, flexible material which I like because sometimes walking down a steep slope my big toes press against the front of my shoe. I use these shoes for long daily walks with my wife and dog, and I'm 6'5\" and 280lb so I'm hard on shoes.",

This version is electric green, rather than brownish-red (that image was mistakenly put on two models).Aside from that, these fit snugly a half-size larger than your true foot size. They have a comfy bounce and cushion to them. The tread isn't super-deep, but it's pronounced and seems to have held up well after a week of alternating with another pair of shoes.",

I'm in a casual rock band and because these are all black, they are great for the stage. These are comfortable, looked nice and have a great lifespan.I got them for about $60 on sale. I bought 2 more pairs because I like them so much. Very happy with this. Size was as expected.",
