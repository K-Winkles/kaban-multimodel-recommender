The only reason I gave only 4 stars to durability is because they are quite new, and durability will take some time to assess. However I have had shoes with similar man-made construction that didn't stand the test of time; we'll see if these are better, but they will never wear as well as real leather.I'm so impressed with these at this price point, I'm going to buy another pair so I can spread the life of these shoes over two pairs. The price-point is perfect for having two pairs, and being able to alternate if one is exposed to moisture or rain. A really good buy I took a chance on and was pleasantly surprised.",
