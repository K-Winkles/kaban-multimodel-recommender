                "reviewText": "Usually wear a size 7 1/2 shoe and have a somewhat wide foot. Because Speedo brands tend to run smaller than their advertised size, I ordered a size 8. The ankle fits appropriately snug, but the challenge is the length. The shoe almost (almost) feels like one is wearing diving fins. But they appear durable and well-made. I will update as one wears them throughout the coming summer months. Not that it matters, but the color \"navy/blue\" is a bit lighter than shown on the computer screen (if you're a stickler for that sort of thing).UPDATE: June 29, 2017: Wore the shoes for the first time. Was at Hampton Beach, New Hampshire during a pouring rain and thunder & lightening storm. Stayed off the beach, but walked on the boardwalk where there are food vendors, arcade amusements, gift shops, etc. The shoes did a good job of sloshing through the huge puddles on the pavement, but to my disappointment, there is NO ARCH SUPPORT. The shoes are flat on the inside. Thus, if you have fallen arches or flat feet, this product may feel uncomfortable for you.FINAL UPDATE: August 1, 2017: Finally got to the beach. It is difficult to walk on dry sand with them. In that respect, they are similar to wearing street shoes on dry sand. And sand does get inside them. In terms of drying, it takes longer than airing them out overnight for them dry completely. Closer to a full day before the Surfwalker becomes completely dry again.BOTTOM LINE: A solidly made, good product. Though the design has its flaws (please see above) they are worth one's hard-earned money.Final Grade: B.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these for an upcoming trip to Tulum, Mexico to be used when swimming around the cenotes. I'm a street size 8 and originally ordered the size 8 but when it arrived the length overshot my big toe by at least 3/4 inch. I ordered the size 7 and it fits perfectly. A bit snug but that's how water shoes should fit. When removing the shoe, the inside footbed slipped out but it's supposed to be removeable and can easily be slid back in so not a big deal. I'm a fan of Speedo gear generally (I have swim trunks in a matching blue) and these shoes look great. There's a lot of cheaper options available on Amazon but the negative reviews regarding the quality of those cheaper pairs is what would be expected so I stayed away from them and chose this instead. Hopefully paying a bit more for the Speedo brand and the related level of expected quality will stand the test of time, wear, and its intended purpose.------UPDATE (9/26/19):Tried these out at Sac Atun cenote (underground cave) in Mexico and these held up great. They were perfect for what I needed and very comfortable. Will be using these for all outdoor water adventures going forward and highly recommend!",

I originally bought these in my usual size 9, but they were much too tight. I returned them and purchased size 10. They seemed OK at first, but when I used them for a couple of days in a row I wound up with large, painful sores on both of my big toes. I will be returning these and purchasing another brand that I hope will not be as narrow.",

                "reviewText": "I had bought these shoes before at the local sports store. I use them as daily shoes. But I wanted a black pair. The store only had them blue and green. So, I bought them here at Amazon. This pair is just as good as the other one. They are so comfortable. They adjust to your foot completely. One of my heels is a little bit displaced due to flat feet. So, with regular walking shoes, it starts feeling uncomfortable after the heel of the shoe softens. But these shoes are always tight, in a relaxed way. It is like having gloves for your feet. Speedo makes great products. I have two Speedo bathing suits and they are very comfortable too.I have read reviews that claim that you can not put these shoes on because the opening is too narrow. It is true that it is narrow. However, if you slide the foot in and then with your finger you stretch it around your ankle, the material stretches and adapts.They are good for water, but once you use them in the water, the inner sole unglues and it does not stay fixed again. I just threw those inner soles away and inserted a Dr. Shoolls inner sole with arch. Now, when I am going in the water with them, I remove the Dr. Shoolls inner sole.",
