We will have to wait to see how the quality holds up over time but so far, so good.",

I work around a lot of water and slick concrete and metal and they definitely grip great and quality I haven\u2019t had any issues yet and I\u2019m rough on shoes. Only thing that could make these better is the comfort of the padding on the inside. After 10 to 12 hours of working and walking by the end of the shift my feet hurt almost to where I felt like I wasn\u2019t wearing anything at all. I did replace the inside of the shoes to make them a lot more comfortable but that was my only downside with the shoes.",

This shoe does not qualify (and shouldn't be marketed as) a slip-on. Any shoe that I need a shoe horn to get into is not a slip-on.With that said...once the shoe is actually ON, the fit is incredible. It is extremely comfortable, and I got tons of comments on the style/look of them the first few days I wore them. Apart from the difficulty in getting them on, my only other (very!) minor gripe is that I wish the decorative laces were shorter. I want to tie them and forget about them, but even knotted they get snagged and come undone.Don't know if I would recommend this shoe, but I hope this is helpful.",
