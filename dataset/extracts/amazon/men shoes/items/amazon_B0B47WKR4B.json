                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars EXCELLENT. Subtle changes but huge improvement over prior models",
                "reviewText": "I've been wearing the Asics GT line for over 20 years and trained for my last marathon on GT-2000 9s. These 11s are the best Asics update in a LONG time and while the changes are subtle they make a significant difference in the experience.FIT: The GT line has had a very consistent architectural fit over the years and the 2000-11s continue that. Sizing is consistent with prior models. Just the right placement and height of the arch, excellent shape of the heel and forefoot, trademark dual-zone pronation correction. If earlier GT models fit your feet well, so will these.TOE BOX: In recent iterations (including the 2000-9s), Asics has slightly narrowed the toe box. While it wasn't enough on me to lead to blistering, it was noticeable and just slightly uncomfortable on longer runs as my feet swelled. The 2000-11 has returned just enough width to the toe box that it solves the issue for me. Great fit in a true D width that keeps your forefoot contained without being too tight or too roomy.WEIGHT / RIDE: The 2000-11s are lighter than past models thanks to new FlyteFoam Blast in the midsole, which is softer and lighter than previous materials. It's a small difference (0.2 ounces compared to the 2000-9s) but it's noticeable. The shaping of the sole also promotes a better foot strike with smoother landings and transitions, avoiding the clunkiness that came with the 2000-9s. With the 2000-9s I was conscious of the shoe in my gait. With the 2000-11s it feels much more natural and integrated into my foot/stride.UPPER: Asics continues to thin out the uppers with next-gen woven materials. But they've done an excellent job here. No hotspots, the finish is attractive. Plenty of flex and stretch. The laces are thinner and flatter, both minimizing pressure points at the tongue and keeping them tied better. There is some slight lengthwise flexion/creasing in the upper around the toe box that might lead to wear and tear, but so far not a significant issue. The upper heel is still very well cushioned and silky smooth, which means blisters should not be a problem around the achilles area.COLORWAYS: In my opinion, the only real weak spot for the line. None of the colorways are all that distinctive or appealing. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the sage green. Having grown tired of dark grays and navy, and not wanting to go loud with bright electric colors, I was left with sage as the only light option. In the product photos the sage has almost a camo/khaki tinge making it look a little dirty or worn. In person it's much closer to a cool sage, which I find really nice.OVERALL: I've been extremely happy with the 2000-11s. With the 2000-9s I was suffering mild-to-moderate quad soreness after long runs, which I attribute to the slightly clunky ride. I have had zero issues in the 2000-11s and actively look forward to being able to lace them up and take them out. They fit my feet perfectly, are pleasant to run in, and leave me feeling fresher than my previous trainers did. Highly recommend, especially if you have run in previous GT models and know they fit for you.",

This is the best running shoe I've come across in a long time. They're super comfortable, great for a neutral running form, and really relieve a lot of nagging injuries. Many of my calf, achilles, and knee problems have gone away since I've switched to this shoe. Again, I'm not the greatest runner anymore but I think this will be my stopping point for running shoes going forward. I highly recommend.",

I ordered these asics in a UK 10.5 as there was no option to choose a Euro size. What I was sent was a Euro size 46. After checking the Asics website I see that is their sizing convention which seems to be different to any other brand I have used. These trainers are therefore half a size too big which is really annoying because they were shipped from America which meant I had to wait a long time for them to arrive, and I can't send them back because my wife very efficiently threw the box out.Aside from being a bit big, they are very comfy and the build quality is great. If they were the right size and it hadnt taken so long for them to arrive from America I would probably give them 5 stars.",
