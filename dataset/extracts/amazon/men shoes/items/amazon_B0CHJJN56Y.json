You can slip them on and not have to worry about shoelaces. And the fact that these are ankle boots, I felt a little more rugged and protected, for urban settings. These will look great with a pair of jeans or pants. While the material is synthetic, they look and feel really good. The stitching is real so that gives it an authentic touch. The inner sole can also be removed and replaced when the time comes.",

                "reviewText": "Likes: Clean look, comfort, easy-on, fit below the ankleDislikes: Ankle feels loose and would rub without high socks. Alternate material around heel detracts from look.Ordered these to see if they would do for semi-formal option. I really like the look although I wish the heel were defined by stitching instead of another material. I tend to lace my boots snug so the loose ankle keeps fooling me that my non-existent laces are untied. Given prices these days, $50 for a halfway decent shoe is hard to beat.",
