But I have to wear them sometimes (you can only get away with wearing sneakers so many times), so after reading other reviews, I decided to take the plunge with these.Are they the most comfortable shoes ever? No. Because they're dress shoes. Are they the most comfortable dress shoes I've ever had while still looking high quality and dressy. Yes, yes they are. I'm not going to go running in them, but when I need to wear dress shoes (like I did today), I can wear them all day and not have my feet aching at the end of the day. Which is actually high praise for dress shoes.",
