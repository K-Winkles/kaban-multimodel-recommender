They are comfortable and easy to get on and take off, they wash well and have denim? outers which makes them a little more durable. Also a great boat shoe, and again somehow I always get them filthy fishing, it's nice to be able to wash them and expect them to come out in good shape.",

Kick them off easy when its time to go bare foot. Dry out ultra quick and sand falls out of them. A hose, a leaf blower and 5 minutes and they are clean enough to wear to church. I've gotten a pair a summer for the past 4 or 5 years straight and still have 3 or 4 of them kicking around as worn-but-wearable spares and back ups. Comfortable but way more rugged and protective than the comfort oriented hey dudes. I got the camo this time around because they were on sale, probably because they are pretty ugly. I figured that going in, and for what they are doesn't matter much to me. Get a half size smaller than you normally would wear they stretch a little.",
