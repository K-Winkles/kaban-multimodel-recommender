It was immediately apparent to me that these were the winning pair.Pros-Light weight but structurally strongThe heel cup is pronounced holding my foot in place nicely even when unlacedGreat shock absorptionMiddle of the road arch support, it neither pushes into my foot nor does it leave my arch floatingThe shoe widens out at the ball of the foot just right to support the sides of my feet without squeezing them.Cons-Basic insole, that\u2019s comfortable but not as padded or advanced as other shoesLow rise ankle socks are a no no with these shoes as the heel cup I enjoy will suck your sock into the shoe and off your heel.All in all, for $40-$55 these are great shoes. They don\u2019t even feel like you\u2019re wearing shoes. The wife likes the look and feel so much she made me order her a woman\u2019s pair of the same shoe. You can\u2019t go wrong with this shoe",

                "reviewText": "I rarely write reviews for things unless I feel like I got a lousy product and I want to help others not have the same experience, but these shoes have been so outstanding that I had to do a review on them. I work for the Post Office and walk on average 12 miles a day 5 - 6 days a week and finding affordable comfortable shoes that last with this much walking is not easy. I bought these Under Armour Charged Asset 9 shoes out of default, trying to find another brand that would hold up to the miles and abuse, because the Rebok, NB and several other name brand shoes I have been wearing only last a few months tops.I've been wearing these almost every workday for almost 4 months with the exception of a few days that it snows, and I am beyond impressed with the minimal wear they are showing. They still have roughly 75% of the tread left, the soles are still attached and not separating, and no holes worn through the very well-made and somewhat thick mesh type material on the top - all of these things I mentioned were common failures of most of the other shoes I've been wearing.After the first few days I wore them, I liked them so much that I looked and found some more on Amazon Warehouse at a great price and I snatched them up. I did put my favorite insoles in them, but I do that with all of my shoes, so I can't rate the factory insoles, but overall, I am very impressed with the quality of these shoes.Bottom line: If you want some long wearing, very comfortable shoes, give these a shot, I doubt you'll regret it.",

                "reviewText": "These shoes usually last a few months because I used them as a work shoe and I have to walk between 10k and 30k steps plus carrying weight. They look great and once the backs are broken in they are very comfortable until the insoles eventually give out and I have to change them or the shoe because they will start to roll to the inside for me and it can be problematic but that is from heavy duty use. Great style. Get yourself a pair or more.",
