                "reviewText": "Love the Code Chaos line from Adidas, and own several pairs of the '20 models and the newer '22 models. I am a little annoyed that the last pair I purchased went on sale for $15 less than what I paid (but still haven't even worn the shoes yet), but that doesn't prevent me from buying these shoes on Amazon. Just monitor the pricing to get the best price. As for the shoe itself, these are one of the best options out there if you want comfort, support, stability, and traction. The outsole pattern really works great on the course, and the boost cushioning and lateral support really keep you feet fresh throughout the round. The heel collar design also works great to minimize any chance to achilles blistering that so many other golf shoes get wrong. Can't recommend these shoes enough for golfers, especially at the price Amazon is now selling them for.Tip: these run true to size, but go 1/2 size bigger if you have wider feet like me.",

More comfortable (if that is possible), stable, and waterproof. The sizing is tricky since the toe is a little tight. Need to try out several sizes to get the right one. They also are pretty cool looking shoes.Note that the Codechaos 22 version is much different and better than the Codechaos 21 version.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a big fan of Adidas golf shoes with their Boost technology midsoles. I bought these shoes to replace a 4+ year old pair of Adidas Tour360 XT spikeless shoes. The old pair are still fine, I just wanted a more updated style shoe. The Codechaos22 shoes are even more comfortable than my old shoes. The design is wider at the forefoot and the toe box than my old shoes. I'll admit, they are a radical design and look. It's something you either love or hate. I used to think that they looked too odd, but I bought these during Prime Day and was able to purchase them for $58 so I couldn't resist. After I received then and tried them on, I actually liked the modern look of the shoe. After wearing them on the course, I really appreciated the comfort AND the performance. The rounded tread wrapped over the sides of the shoe adds to the traction through my swing. I hope the fabric upper with the waterproof film holds up to normal wear over time. Will update this review if necessary.",

If you have wide feet or longer toes like I do, size up a bit.They are nice and squishy and comfortable to walk in. The heel cup in the back is a little stiff, so still working on breaking that in, I've only played 18 so far.They conduct heat fairly well for being waterproof, I didn't get super hot or sweat too bad in them.Grip is fantastic. They really hold the turf well in a swing.When on sale, a pretty decent shoe!",
