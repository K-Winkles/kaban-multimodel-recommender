                "reviewText": "My husband loves them. He received many compliments about them. He is a letter carrier for USPS and his shoes don\u2019t last very long. So far these shoes not only look nice but have actually held up. His shoes always separate at the seams or tend to get holes at the top or tears. Although, he wipes them down every once and awhile and the shoes look new again. We are both very impressed at the quality of this shoe. These are the first shoes he\u2019s had, that are not boots, which have actually survived his heavy foot. His shoes for work have never lasted this long. Especially, with all the walking he does on a daily basis. He says they don\u2019t hurt his feet and they are easy to maintain. He also likes the holes at the top which help with ventilation in the summer. His only complaint is the shoe laces. He says they are too short so it makes it hard for him to tie his shoes. It wasn\u2019t too big of an issue because he can buy a new set of inexpensive laces. However, it is something to keep in mind. He is usually a 9.5 and I bought a size 9. He said he was worried at first when he started wearing his shoes because the side of the shoe where his pinky toe rests started to become a bit sore. Yet, after the first few days the shoe seemed to have stretched and he said it is now not a problem. He said the tread where his heel is has also begun to wear out but most of the tread is still there. He said he assumes it is because of all the stairs he goes up and down everyday. All in all he is happy with these shoes.",

                "reviewText": "If sneakers had a hall of fame for enduring the antics of adventurous teenagers, Nike's Men's Court Vision Lo Sneakers would be first-ballot inductees! I bought a pair for my son last Christmas, and believe me, these shoes have seen things. They've been on a two-year-long expedition into what I can only describe as the 'deep, dark abyss' of mud, rain, and every imaginable teenage adventure.The first pair, affectionately known as 'Mud Divers,' finally succumbed to the relentless exploration. They've been through it all - impromptu soccer games, unexpected puddle jumps, and those mysterious ventures into the woods that only teenagers understand. Yet, they held up with the resilience of a seasoned explorer.So, when Christmas rolled around again, guess what was at the top of my son's list? Another pair of these indomitable Nike Court Vision Lo Sneakers. This time, I'm half expecting them to come with a built-in compass and a survival guide!As for the shoes themselves, they're stylish enough to get approving nods from his fashion-conscious peers and durable enough to withstand his outdoor shenanigans. The comfort level must be through the roof because he wears them like they're part of his feet. I'm beginning to wonder if Nike secretly crafts these with some kind of teenage invincibility technology.If you have a teenager who treats sneakers like they're all-terrain vehicles, Nike's Court Vision Lo Sneakers are the way to go. They're tough, they're trendy, and they might just be the only pair of shoes your teen will ever willingly wear. Here's to hoping the new pair enjoys the same legendary status as the 'Mud Divers'!",
