                "reviewText": "I needed a new racquetball shoe. Medical data shows that hi-tops don't significantly help to prevent ankle sprains. I'd worn dunks for decades but wanted a super light weight shoe. I decided to stop using dunks.I found the asics Gel Rocket 10, did my research, and determined that they should be great for indoor courts that have wood (volleyball, racquetball, squash) or that green / blue hard-court resin (like for tennis or pickleball).These shoes are GREAT for racquetball. Super grippy. Light weight (320 grams which is excellent - Salming shoes are at 300grams which are arguable the best in the biz but expensive).The inserts that come with it are very thin - too thin for my feet. I replaced them with the same Sof Sole Athletic inserts that are sold at Academy:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J7YQW1TThe result is near perfection IMO. I paid $65 for black ones during a sale on Amazon. I don't know of a better deal considering asics is a quality brand.Fit was pretty near spot on. I'm 11.5 US. Maybe just a hair too big but I know I have odd size feet. The new inserts brought me up a little higher which made the shoe fit perfect.Thanks asics for making this product. It's a good one.",

I am an avid \"pickler\" now and have found this specific shoe to fit my need and movement on the court. The sole may not be intended fir the outdoor pickleball/tennis court surface as it wears down in 3 months (based on my playing 5 times a week and switching between two colors of this same shoe). But I love it for the price but mostly for the comfort (gel) and my feet are not sore at all after 4-5 hours of play in a day. It's so good that I bought an extra pair in case Asics stops making this model.",

Comfortable and just the right amount of grip. They do skid very slightly , which I like because it prevents me from locking and tearing my knees after a sudden change of direction. At the same time I have never slipped or fallen. They have held up well after several months of playing almost daily. I liked them enough to get a second pair for the future.",
