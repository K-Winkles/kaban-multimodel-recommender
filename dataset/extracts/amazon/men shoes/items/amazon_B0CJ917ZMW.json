They are very comfortable not just in the souls, but on the sides there is lots of cushion, and they are breathable, but not too thin. Very stylish for work shoes and the nonslip tread works amazing. I feel much safer working in the kitchen wearing these, I looked at a lot of different nonslip work shoes and these were the most stylish ones I came across for a reasonable price. If you\u2019re thinking about getting them you should because they are great!",

                "reviewText": "Initially these shoes were comfortable but after wearing them for a few hours my feet began to ache. I am on my feet a lot for my job and was looking to purchase a cheaper shoe than my normal purchase which are the Skechers non slip work shoes. Thats what I get for playing myself and my feet cheap. Skechers if not on sale can run you $80/90 and based off the reviews I was confident with my purchase. Unfortunately they're not as comfortable. If you don't have to be on your feet much then they make a great buy but these shoes will fool you because they start off plush and comfy and then your dogs begin to hurt. Luckily for me I didn't throw out my old Skechers. I'm just gonna have to bite the bullet and pay for another pair but its worth it.",
