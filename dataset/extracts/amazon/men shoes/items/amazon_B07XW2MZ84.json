                "reviewText": "I bought a few different styles/brands of shoes all 11W. Not only did I like the look of this one the best, this one fit the best right away. The construction of the shoe seems pretty solid. The bottom of the shoe is higher quality than the other shoes I ordered as well. It actually has some grip to it. The one thing that I'm not thrilled with is after wearing the shoes for a day, the stitching around the side of my big toe was rubbing against my skin. I'm hoping after wearing these more will stretch that part out.",
