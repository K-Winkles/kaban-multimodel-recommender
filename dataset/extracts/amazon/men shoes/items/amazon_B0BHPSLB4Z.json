I wasn't disappointed and they came in great condition and delivery was as expected. I can tell you how nice these shoes look and I've got my wardrobe in place already. What I like about these is that they're easy to slip on and off, they're, light weight, and they are a good fit. They have a nice hug around the ankle and they are true size so stick with my normal size and I have about 1/2\" cushion which gives me great comfort. You don't have to worry about the shoe coming off as it fits like a glove, so you can run, jump, or workout in these with no issues. The best thing about these shoes is the style, and then in a strong 2nd is the comfort. I own multiple pair of Adidas and these are just as comfortable as my older ones with a nice look. I don't have a call out for anything I didn't like I love Adidas and that's a fact.",

                "reviewText": "Very comfortable for everyday use, running, sports or gym use. They might have a tighter foot entrance than you're use to (if you haven't worn similar ones before) but not to worry, it's just tighter to make sure they stay on your feet. I have been buying this style of shoe from adidas for a few years now and I've been loving them. Very durable shoe as well. I've been using one of the pairs for 3 years as a work shoe (it's not one but I use it as one) and the shoe is in great condition considering it's a more labor intensive job and always on my feet. So I'd say these will last you a good amount of time and while having a good look and feel.",

Just slip on and goThe cons: Water soaks thru easily. Walking on grass early in the morning gets the toes wet. That's to be expected from a mesh-shoe.",
