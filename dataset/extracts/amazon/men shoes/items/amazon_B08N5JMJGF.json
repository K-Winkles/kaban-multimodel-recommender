We struggle big time with shoes, we have found that this shoe is easy to get on and off with the least amount of effort. Definitely a good purchase for us. The only con I have with this product is that there isn't a style available similar to this that is waterproof. If I could change anything about the shoe it would be just to make it hold up to the elements a bit better. we wear through them rather quickly because the material isn't as durable as it should be, in my opinion.",

                "reviewText": "some one else made a review about the insole being very thin, their review is very misleading because the shoe as a whole provides incredible comfort and shock absorption. I have two knee injury's and I had a low budget so I bought these to care for my knees, asides from the insole it has a large degree of cushioning and padding that massively improved my knee condition, the insole plays almost no role in this but the other aspects of the shoe does, if you are looking for a super light shoe with great padding and shock absorption these are great, really felt an incredible difference from my old work shoes, I walk all day so I need some shoes to relieve the pain. I am 6'3 280 pounds and I was also able to add some custom insoles into it, was a little tight at first but loosened up and will probably be able to add a 3rd insole",
