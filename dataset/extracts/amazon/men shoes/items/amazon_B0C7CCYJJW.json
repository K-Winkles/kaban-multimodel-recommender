Because they are extra roomy, you don't know how to compare with the usual size. In my case, the person's usual size is 10 1/2 so I bought an 11 just to make sure. However, it turned out he didn't need that extra length so I had to exchange them for his usual size 10 1/2.Because they are extra wide you can probably buy your usual size.",

I was reluctant to order simply because it was a guessing game if they would fit but the fact that they would be returnable gave me the confidence to try.They were shipped from China, took about two weeks but arrived one day before the quoted date. I haven\u2019t felt bad about this purchase. They fit just right, comfortable and stable, plenty of toe room all for a low price. I have my confidence in standing and the little walking that I do renewed by your product. Thank you.",
