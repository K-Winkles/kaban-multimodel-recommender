I\u2019m a 13 non wide and they are super comfortable. There\u2019s plenty of room in them in the right places like the toe box but snug to support your foot. I wear these as a daily and still work out in my Brooks but these will work in a pinch too. They were also great in this last snow with limited slippage.",

                "reviewText": "Have been wearing Altra shoes about a year and a half. Walk/hike in a canyon 10 miles a day with 2,000 plus feet of total elevation gain. These shoes are great and I don\u2019t need an expensive insole like I did with the Lone Peak 6. The wide toe box is good no need for an extra wide shoe to make toes comfortable like when wearing Asics. There is a lot of cushion in the sole for long hikes and the soles last longer for my hiking and daily wear. Shoe strings can be a bit too short if all holes are used- try litlaces or other comparable slightly longer and more flexible laces. If soles peel after lots of wear use thin loctite superglue as recommended by fleet feet salesperson (he said it happens with all brands)Normally wear size 13 and 13 fits me well in this shoe.",

I purchased this pair when I got home and just finished a five mile hike. Compared to my HOKA Speed Goat Fives, the Altras have a nice toe box. Cushion was good but size wise my pair were a bit small. I normally wear 10.5 but on my walk my toes were pushed hard against the toe box front. I should have gone with a half or full size larger. Not a big fan of the lace material either - seems cheap and brittle. Overall, were I to purchase more Altras, I would go a full size bigger.",

Been loving this shoe and telling friends to check them out, until the soles started falling apart. Are you kidding me. $200 hiking shoe I was going to use in Utah this September!!! Filed a warranty with Altra. We will see what they say and I will update...By the way, I have a pair of Soloman that are 4 years old that have 100's of miles on them and they just started showing wear. I should have stuck with that brand, but I wanted something will more cushion for long, rocky hikes out west.****UPDATE-Altra won't honor their warranty because I bough them on Amazon through an unauthorized dealer. Sounds like a good way for Altra to get rid of faulty shoes. sell them at a discount to an unauthorized dealer at least they they recoup some money. What a shame.",

They feel great, they've not needed breaking in at all and I've not had any stability issues from the increased stack height. My only complaint is the laces, which need to be a good 20cm/8\" longer - they're just barely long enough to do a double knot IF I don't use the last set of eyelets.",
