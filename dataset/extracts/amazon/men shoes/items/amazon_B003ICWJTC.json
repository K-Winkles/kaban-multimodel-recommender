                "reviewText": "These are great shoes and I've owned a dozen pairs over the last 10+ years and will be ordering more. They are, however, 'cheap' shoes (no insult intended) - not your hand-stitched leather jobs from Italy, and if worn frequently will probably only last about a year or so. I walk about 2 miles a day and wear them quite often, and I usually find the heel wears down between 12 and 18 months. That said, they are extremely comfortable (possibly the most comfortable loafers I've ever worn), very stylish and fairly slip resistant, and as they're light weight, great for travel. I have a grey pair I only wear when on holiday in Europe and have had that pair for about a decade. I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutley love this shoes. THe picture does not do the color of grey justice. I absolutely love the color. Its not a light grey its a rich beautiful grey. Beware these shoes fit tight in regards to width until you wear them for a day or two. After that, they are amazingly comfortable. I will be purchasing exact same shoe in black very soon. Also, as recommended by others, order 1/2 size smaller than you would typically wear. I was skeptical at this at first, but with easy returns, I decided to follow the review advice. Its a perfect fit length wise, just remember, they are tight at first but break in quick and easy and are my favorite pair of dress shoes. I wear them all day, at least twice per week.",

                "reviewText": "Short review:Well made, true to size, good price. Only good things to say. Buy it.Review:It was time to retire my old pair of shoes. I seem to get up to a year out of any given pair. My previous slip-ons we also Steve Madden. (Whom I have a different view on since watching Wolf of Wall Street, but I digress). They wore well, were quite soft the day I bought them, and lasted about a year. Good deal. These seem similar. They basically require no break in. If my previous pair is any indication, these will last me 9 - 12 months even though they are comfortable now.The design of these is not what I expected. I didn't look at the pictures to carefully. I'm not a fan of the stitching along the side panels. The workmanship is fine, I just didn't know they were there. The show is black and the stitching is not very noticeable unless you're looking for it. The toe panels are also stitched from the top onto the sole. It;s hard to explain in words, but look at the second photo on the product page. It looks odd to me. Again, it's a black shoe and you won't see it unless you're looking right at the shoe, but I don't like it.Other than the strange design choices, I like the shoes. They're comfortable and very good value. I'll be back in the market for some Steve Maddens in another 9 months or so.Bottom line: Recommended. Caveat: Look at the photos on the product page before you buy.",

                "reviewText": "I've had 6 pairs of these (I -really- like them), but one thing others may want to note is that the one's on Amazon are not the same shoe as the ones available at Macy's and other department stores\u2014I know, I own both (1 pr from Macy's, 5 from Amazon).Both shoes are labeled the same and sizing is very close, but the critical difference that I've noticed is the heel and odor.Department store version:Solid heel that feels like wood or plastic; is not pliable and makes an authoritative 'click-click' (heel-toe) sound on any hard surface. After 6-8 months, the sole began separating from the shoe from about toe to arch\u2014it is glued, rather than sewn, which is to be expect for a shoe in this price-range.Amazon version:Very soft heel, arguably more comfortable to walk distances. Also quieter on hard surfaces. Shoes developed a strong odor after about 5-6 months (other reviewer noted the same). Similar glue construction but less separation of sole from shoe.Curiously, the department store shoes are the oldest pair I own and while they've developed some odor, it's not as strong as what I've found from the Amazon version.Summary, Closing:These are great shoes for the price. They wear well with dark denim jeans or a suit. I've received many complements on them. Just know they are not quite identical to the slightly higher-price department store version and be prepared to replace them in 6-12 months depending on how often they're worn.",

                "reviewText": "They do run a bit small...i'd guess about 1/2 size. very difficult to pull on w/o shoehorn. However, the toe style is quite long (not as excessive as the \"bancroft\" which was about 3\" beyond toes), they extend about 1 1/2\" beyond toes, so ordering up will make that even worse.Once on, they are snug but pretty comfortable.Quality looks very decent for the price. They are not real leather, they are PU (synthetic), but that is disclosed in the description so not a minus. The stitch and sole detail looks very nice.Will have to wait and see how they last. I'm afraid the toe area will break down quickly because of the excessive bend due to the extra long toe box. I wore them for about 5 mins around the house and they are already permanently creased....",

                "reviewText": "I use these shoes for work daily, and have bought extras just to have since they are nice & comfortable. The heel area is a softer leather so it's very flexible and very easy feeling on your feet. Soft & comfortable to walk in all day long. Plus, the styling of the stitching on the shoe is a very nice design and mimics some expensive Hugo Boss shoes that I also own.My only gripe is that I wish they were more breathable. After daily use for about 3-4 months, I have to change them out since they develop an oder inside of them. However, I wouldn't consider this as a drop in rating, mainly because my feet like to sweat and I walk a lot, so your personal experiences may differ. That being said, I'd rather keep using these shoes than getting a different brand that doesn't feel as comfortable for me.",
