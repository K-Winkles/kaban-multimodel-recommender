                "reviewText": "I generally wear Asics Kayano shoes, and bought these for a trip where waterproof shoes might be important. They fit the same and look fine, but I get tired of walking in them because they aren't as supportive as I'd like.Tip: I liked them better after I laced them to the top. They come with long laces, laced to one eyelet below the top. The long laces got in the way, so I laced them higher. Now they're harder to put on and take off, but easier to wear. And my supportiveness complaint was less of a factor after lacing them higher.",

No more wet, smelly PE shoes or wrinkled, painful feet.Kids are weird so we have to weirdproof them.Overall a good buy and I\u2019ll be repurchasing as needed.",

                "reviewText": "I've been buying ASICS Gel-Venture shoes for many years, and was always able to get a comfortable fit. Not with Gel-Venture 9 as the fit and design has changed. The insoles of the padding now use something called Ortholite, which doesn't provide the same arch support that were in the previous Gel-Venture versions. Additionally, they removed the extra eye hole at the top (Gel-Venture 8 has six eye holes, in contrast Gel-Venture 9 has 5 eye holes).In summary, the design and fit as changed enough that I won't be wearing this version of the shoe. Not a fan of the changes and won't be buying them again.",
