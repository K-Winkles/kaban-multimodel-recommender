        "description": "The Elite boxing shoes are the result of strategic research, development and collaboration between our product engineers and #TeamVenum boxing champions.Battle tested in training and live bouts, VENUM fighters Jorge Linares, Miguel Berchelt, and Juan Francisco Estrada have had the privilege of experiencing the support, stability and grip of the Venum Elite boxing shoe. Our goal was not to offer \u2018just\u2019 another boxing shoe, but the best product available on the market. The sole was one of the most intricate components to develop. Whilst necessary to combine characteristics such as lightness, strength, stability and grip, it had to provide explosive support to allow a boxer to move very quickly in any direction. Whilst including these dynamic qualities, the Venum boxing shoe had to offer comfort and protection to the wearer. The insole was designed to perfectly fit the plantar arch of the foot, without being too bulky or uncomfortable. Despite being a shoe optimized for the attacker, the Venum Elite allows the wearer to manage the distance thanks to the excellent lateral ankle support provided by its mid-cut silhouette. Defensive manoeuvres are handled with ease. To maximize comfort, the \u201dHoneycomb\u201d mesh enables the foot to breathe during the most intense workouts, whilst being incredibly resistant and increasing the longevity of the shoe. Although performance was at the heart of the design, being a Venum product, style and design have not been forgotten.",

Spoke to a lot of fighters and decided to get Venum boots. It was a big jump in cost for me the wrestling shoes were only $60. So worth the jump up!!!!Super well made and so much more ankle support. Something I had no idea I was missing was the glide a real boxing show allows. These boots glide and grip hard when you throw your punch. The wrestling shoes grip constantly.Get these boots! Your able to move your feet faster and more natural. Trust me it\u2019s noticeable! As soon as the weight transfers all the grip you want and need is right there.",

                "reviewText": "Only reason for 1 star is the refusal of customer service. Wore these 10 times and the sole started to break. It was a manufacturing defect in the stitching.I contacted Venum. They told me they couldn\u2019t honor any warranty because I didn\u2019t buy them through the official website. I only ordered on Amazon because they have basically no inventory on the website. So basically Venum doesn\u2019t stand behind their shoes. AVOID! Go with Adidas or Nike because they stand behind their product.I had Nike soccer cleats awhile back and they honored the warranty 1 year later !",

Better for generating power punches and quick direction changes with footwork.Cushioning- Very little, but your feet can\u2019t slip. I added a silicone gel insole to reduce blistering.Ankle support- GoodLaces- Should be longer imo, but I\u2019ve thought that about every pair of boxing shoes I\u2019ve used. Even 180cm laces feel short on these but I can\u2019t find laces longer than that in India.Durability- Will edit with pica when they get worn out.Beats the RXN pair and the Decathlon pair but it\u2019s 10k more. If hyperkos are ever available in India, I\u2019d love to compare them.",
