                "reviewText": "My husband bought a pair for himself and I was on the search for a new pair of kicks. I have plantar fasciitis and am a nurse on my feet 13 hours of the day so needless to say my feet were aching. I got the mens because the colors in the womens I didn\u2019t like. I wear size 8 women\u2019s usually. For the mens shoes I ordered EUR 39 and they are perfect size for me. It took a couple of shifts for me to get used to them but I can work all day, come home, and my feet aren\u2019t sore! I have wider feet so I was concerned about that. It is kind of a pain to slip on compared to my New Balance and Pumas but once they are on they are perfect. The plastic soles took sometime to get used to but I actually really enjoy these shoes! If you don\u2019t like them, give them a couple days that\u2019s what it took for me. The first day I thought I would return them but again after the 3rd day they are my new favorite shoes. I ordered another pair different color!",
