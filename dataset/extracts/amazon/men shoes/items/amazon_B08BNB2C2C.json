I also like it comes in a wide width.",

I recently replaced my shoes because my feet had gotten larger with aging and I needed a larger pair. The didn't have the size that I wanted at the local sporting store so I tried a different brand. That didn't work out. The most important reason was that the outside part of the sole hit before the heel area. That through off my balance.I decided to buy my new shoes on Amazon if the still carried that model. They not only did but they had a choice of colors. I had always gotten the ones with orange trim before, I went with the greenish trim this time. The shoes were exactly the same as the ones I have worn over the years except that they were a half size larger. I came them four stars, based mostly on the fact I didn't know how they compare with other similar brands. For me, they have been five stars. Very long wearing, very comfortable, good traction on slippery trains, nice looking, reasonably light for occasional running and for occasional use with court sports.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Decent Trail Running Shoe, but with Some Drawbacks",
                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the New Balance 481 v3 Trail Running Shoe, and overall, my experience with it has been a mix of positive and negative aspects. While it certainly has some notable features, there are a few drawbacks that prevent me from giving it a higher rating.Starting with the positives, the shoe offers a solid level of traction on various terrains. Whether I was running on muddy trails or rocky paths, the outsole provided sufficient grip, allowing me to maintain stability and confidence throughout my runs. Additionally, the shoe's durability impressed me; it held up well even after multiple rigorous trail runs, showing minimal signs of wear and tear.In terms of comfort, the 481 v3 does a decent job. The cushioning provides a good amount of support, especially when dealing with uneven surfaces. The midsole offers enough responsiveness to enhance my running experience, although it may not be as plush or responsive as some other models in its class. The shoe also offers ample room in the toe box, allowing for natural foot movement.However, the fit of the 481 v3 could be improved. While the toe box is spacious, the overall fit feels somewhat loose, especially in the midfoot area. This can cause a lack of stability, which is not ideal when navigating challenging terrains. The lacing system doesn't do much to address this issue, as it doesn't provide enough lockdown or customization options.Another downside of the 481 v3 is its weight. Compared to other trail running shoes in its category, it feels bulkier and heavier. This can be a disadvantage when seeking speed or maneuverability on technical trails. Additionally, the shoe lacks sufficient breathability, resulting in sweaty and uncomfortable feet during longer runs.Lastly, the design and aesthetics of the 481 v3 are rather plain and unremarkable. While this might not be a significant factor for everyone, I personally prefer a shoe that not only performs well but also looks appealing.In short, the New Balance 481 v3 Trail Running Shoe has its strengths, such as solid traction and durability. However, the issues with fit, weight, breathability, and aesthetics prevent me from rating it higher. If you're looking for an affordable option with decent performance on moderate trails, it might be worth considering, but for more serious trail runners, there are better options available.",
