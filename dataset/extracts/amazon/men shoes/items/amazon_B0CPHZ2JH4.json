They are exceptionally light and breathable. They feel almost as comfortable as a slipper, at least on my feet. These are a great pair to wear if you have to be on your feet for long periods of time due to the support they provide. They appear to be well constructed and durable, but of course only time will tell. Skechers feel for better-than-Skechers cost. I certainly recommend these.*********************************** MY RATING SYSTEM ***********************************1 STARProduct either fails to function/perform as intended or described, is significantly lacking in quality and/or represents a very poor value.

Perfect fit, very comfortable to wear, and the treads are exactly what I expected for non-slip shoes. Definitely a great fit for restaurant and quick service food workers, and a great value for the price.",
