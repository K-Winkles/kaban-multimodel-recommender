                "reviewText": "I bought these for my upcoming wedding as an alternative to renting a pair from a tux shop. Very happy with the decision so far. I can't vouch for durability yet because I've only worn them for a few minutes while trying on my tux, but they get high marks across the board from me based on my experience so far.They look amazing. I doubt anyone would consider you underdressed for wearing these regardless of the occasion. The price is lower than higher-end ones, I expect, largely because the soles are rubber (smooth danceable rubber on the sole, though) rather than leather like you might find in higher-priced versions.There is a modest but functional amount of padding in the achilles tendon area, which is a major upgrade from most other shoes of this type I've ever had or considered. It's not going to dig into your heel at all unless you get a pair that's drastically too small for you, perhaps.Literally the only thing I don't like about them is that they are made in China, which was disappointing since I boycott that country's products as much as possible for human rights and patriotic reasons.Still, these shoes are good enough and at such a good value of a price point that I'm making a rare exception to said boycott.By the way, in case you are thinking \"how discerning can this guy be if he's buying $45 shoes for his wedding in the first place?\" I should probably point out that my tux is a high-end custom job costing $3,000, and these look perfectly at home as part of the ensemble, and in fact even add to it. My tailor even went out of his way to say he's really glad I decided to go with an upgraded look on shoes to go with the outfit. I told him they were actually really affordable. He said he knows because of the rubber bottoms, but that apart from that they're exactly what he would recommend regardless of price.The one aspect that you might like or not like, but which I at least wasn't expecting, is that the heel itself is thicker than you'd expect from the average shoe or from just looking at the pictures on here. It almost feels like wearing cowboy boots (not quite that high, though), though it isn't really that noticeable to the eye. I kinda like the feeling, and assume it might add some potential life to the shoe since it has more rubber to wear off before you'd need to throw them out or re-heel them. Just thought it might be worth mentioning in case someone really doesn't like that feel.",

But one thing that I didn\u2019t expect that shoes are not pointy shoes I was expecting it to be pointy but it\u2019s a bland curve. but I still love it it\u2019s so comfortable and awesome I would definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking to buy some patent leather shoes for an upcoming wedding. I ordered my normal size as Amazon recommended that this shoe runs true to size. When it arrived, it was pretty tight in the toe box. The shoe shape was also more boxy than I wanted, especially in the toe box. It did have a strong chemical smell when I first took the shoes out of the box. I\u2019m assuming that wears away the more you wear it. Even just trying it on, it was not very comfortable when I was taking a few steps around inside my house. I realize at this price point, you can\u2019t really be that picky. I ended up returning and ordering 1/2 a size up and in a different, more pointed silhouette that will look more sleek with my tux.",
