I am used to new balance 483 v3's and these are a lot harder to break in. I have about 15-20 hours in these sneakers and they still feel a bit stiff. However I think they will last a long time due to this construction. The hard break in is why I gave 4 stars. I have wide feet and these have plenty of room as well. As for an outdoor work sneaker? Probably not, but as an indoor shoe, I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Before switching to Zappos I bought and alternated between these and the \"Rockport Men's Chranson Black 10.5 M (D)-10.5 M\" from January 2019 for about 2.5 years at my full-time job with corner-to-corner metal, concrete and hazardous chemicals, and both held up decently! They were a bit tight around the toes at first before somewhat adjusting with time and held up decently against chemical spills, repeated impact and constant bending, stretching and twisting before taking one strike too many and fraying at the seams. In addition the soles began chipping and falling off and holes developed around the toe box, but that is to be expected after such lengthy (ab)use. Other pluses include having removable insoles and being stylish, fitting adequately, and being easy to clean. These shoes along with the aforementioned \"Rockport Chranson\" could probably benefit from soles with wider grooves at the bottom as it was easy for pebbles to get stuck between them. As an okay start to medium-quality work shoes I would recommend both shoes for their durability and thickness despite being tough to break in, giving them a serviceable 3/5 stars!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these shoes for doing yard work. I wanted something fairly light but sturdy, with a rubber sole and leather upper (keep dirt and moisture out, but still 'breath' a bit). I did research and narrowed my choice to 2 alternatives, and purchased the New Balance 626 V2, although it was higher price than the alternative shoes. They are a 'true to size' fit for me, comfortable and sturdy. At first, they felt a bit stiff, but I am used to softer, flexible runners and casual foot wear, so the feel of these shoes was not unexpected, especially since I wanted something sturdy for yard work. Overall they felt quite comfortable, and less stiff, within about 1 hour of wear while working in the yard. I am very satisfied with this product -- good design and fabrication job on this one New Balance.",
