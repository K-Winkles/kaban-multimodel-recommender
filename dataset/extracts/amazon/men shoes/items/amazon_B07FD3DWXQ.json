But the sizing is definitely running big. We ordered the 10\u2019s and 9w and ended up going with 9\u2019s. So I would definitely recommend getting 1 whole size smaller. They are fantastic shoes and both my sons love them. They look very chic and pair really well with a dress suit. I would highly recommend these but just make sure you order 1 size down.",
