                "reviewText": "This is a light, very breathable shoe and at a great price and they're very comfortable. Have worn them at the range, but not on the course yet, but everything seems solid and I don't expect any surprises, as far as the fit and comfort are concerned.By the way, this shoe isn't meant to provide any water resistance at all, so I'm no knocking the shoe for that. This is a synthetic fabric shoe and clearly isn't meant to repel ANY water, so just be aware of that. It's just the way the shoes are made, so if you play in the morning, a dewy or freshly-watered course with wet grass will definitely get your feet wet.My only complaint with the shoe is I was a little disappointed with the color. The photos and description don't indicate that the shoe has an off-white color that is actually a light shade of tan/brown. At this price point, it's not a deal breaker, but I will say, fresh out of the box, the shoes almost look a little dirty. And I don't expect that to get any better as these get actual use on the course. So, beware of that light, brownish tint, if that's an issue for you.",
