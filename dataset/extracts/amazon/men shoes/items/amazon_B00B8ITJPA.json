Our Fila Memory Workshift shoe features a rubber slip resistant outsole to provide traction against slick or wet surfaces \u2013 tested in accordance with the applicable industry standards, including: ASTM F2913-11. Though designed to help prevent slips, you should always exercise caution on slick surfaces. The memory foam sockliner and midsole work in unison to provide additional comfort with every step of your day. Face your daily challenges with ease and support with built in perforations for breathability and a variable lace up front closure. Our work shoes are designed to fulfill work in every industry. From healthcare to restaurant, to construction and industrial - when the work day gets long, Fila is there with a shoe that defies expectations to deliver another level of performance and quality design. Fila began in 1911, in the small alpine town of Biella, Italy, a place renowned for manufacturing the world's finest textiles, and weaving fabrics with impeccable quality, true innovation and extraordinary beauty. Born of the city and its traditions, Fila is inexorably derived from Biella's dedication to artistry, luxury and elegance. This is our birthright, it's in our soul, and it defines our future. We continue to enrich the athletic experience by improving comfort and performance with Italian design, quality craftsmanship and refined materials. There is no feeling quite as luxurious as that of playing in Fila, and that is the reason for our existence. We create what is desired, not what is necessary. Not just enough, but more than you need. This is Fila.",

                "reviewText": "As a tall woman who needs a 12 or 13 in shoes, it is HARD finding shoes that meet the specs I need for work (black, non-slip, wipe-clean, no soft or mesh uppers....) that also actually fit and are tolerable comfort-wise. I've lost track of how many pairs I've sent back because the sizing was way off or because they were as comfortable as strapping bricks to my feet.I bought a pair of these last year (Workshift-m, 10.5 M US) and FINALLY, a work shoe that works for me! I wish I could afford to order a dozen pairs in case they ever discontinue them.I had tried them in 10.5 4E Wide but those weren't proportioned right for my feet so had to return them as they were seriously uncomfortable. The regular 10.5 M size is just right though. The fit is good and with my own gel-insoles inserted, the comfort level is just fine, too. Just as important, I have never lost my footing in these so the non-slip soles are reliable. I ordered my last pair in Aug 2022 and even with wearing 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week, it's taken 'til now, a year and a half later, for them finally to be showing enough wear that they need to be replaced. I just ordered my second pair last week and the fit & comfort level hasn't changed so the $20 price increase was worth it. Very happy not to have to deal with searching for, ordering, and returning a bunch of pairs from other brands to find something that'll work. Thumbs-up to these Filas, please don't ever discontinue this style",

                "reviewText": "These were the first FILA shoes I've tried. They are priced lower than most other brands. They are very comfy, with memory foam insoles and all around cushy feel. They are aimed at indoor workers, especially food prep folks, and emphasize their non-slip soles. The sole pattern is finely divided and may tend to track in mud if used outdoors. They aren't designed for trail walking. They look and feel good, so I'm happy with them. They are a little looser on the toe end than I expected, and I have pretty wide size 11 feet. These were the third pair of shoes I tried under the Prime Try before you buy feature, which includes free return shipping if you don't want to keep them. FILA won me over from New Balance, which I've worn for 10 years or more.",

Sin duda sus modelos muestra calidad, tengo aproximadamente 9 meses con esos pares y a decir verdad no han tenido ning\u00fan rasgu\u00f1o ni da\u00f1o por el uso.Sin demasiados c\u00f3modos, s\u00faper resistentes y no pierden la forma.Si eres amante de los tenis, debes de probar la marca fila. Yo dej\u00e9 de usar por un tiempo los modelos de Fila, pero este estilo en color negro, lo adquir\u00ed para llevarlos al trabajo y estar m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo, sin embargo, termin\u00e9 us\u00e1ndolos para toda ocasi\u00f3n jajaj a tal grado que hoy volv\u00ed a comprar unos, y lo mejor es que casi al mismo precio, solo vari\u00f3 unos 80 pesos m\u00e1s.Sin duda no te arrepentir\u00e1s.OJO: compra media talla m\u00e1s grande, porque vienen ajustados, yo los compro exactos de mi talla (7 Mx) y no tuve problemas, pero a decir verdad me hubiera gustado tener medio n\u00famero m\u00e1s para mayor comodidad, ya que entre mas est\u00e9 el calzado, m\u00e1s calor tiende a generar.Les anexo fotos despu\u00e9s de 9 meses de uso rudo.(Obviamente con su cuidado y lavado cada semana)",
