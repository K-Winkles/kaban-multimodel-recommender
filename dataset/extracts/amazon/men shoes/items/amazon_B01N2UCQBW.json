                "reviewText": "It's sad that the world considers 4 stars a negative review, that's not my intent. Anyway, this is for size 10.5 wide mens, black color. My original review followed by two updates is as follows and after the second, I upped the scoring to 5 stars.pros:-The soul is the real deal. Vibram (YAY!), stiff, deeply grooved, you will not slip and you won't complain about walks off of pavement. Vibram simply doesn't wear much. I drag my feet more than I should but Vibram will prevent the shoe from dieing due to the heel wearing through. Amazing product.-From the top they look fairly typical. Merrell seems to sell these shoes with more hiking looking shoelace eyelets but this is the one you want to wear to work. I would note that the grey on the lower sides does stand out a little more than I'd like (why must everything have so much flash?) but it's not too terrible.-Padding is very hiking boot like. This is not a flat shoe and that was great to see. This is much more a hiking shoe in disguise than a casual shoe with fancy rubber on the bottom. Your heel will be higher than your toes and you will have padding trying to level out your foot like a proper hiking boot (imagine walking in sand. The parts where your foot makes the deepest groves are where the strongest padding is.-The wide size worked great for me. Nice wide toe box. Not afraid to look bulbous in order to fit your foot correctly.Cons:-Price! I was willing to pay for quality but I am a little disappointed in the price. This is just my emotional response. I could not find better or equivalent for less-The shoe looks a little sneaker-ish from the side. Looks like a disguised basketball shoe with it's lighter colored side plastic attached to the soul. Not too terrible but you're not going to wear these shoes with dress pants and get away with it. Works well for Jeans though I think for those growing number of places that consider nice jeans totally fine for business casual.-I can't quite get into the back of the shoe. Not sure if this is a break-in issue but my foot is too far forward in the shoe. The padding under the heel is especially sloped. I feel like I will appreciate this more once it's broken in but I think this is the source of some of the negative reviews suggesting the shoe is padded backwards or oddly. Make sure you tie the shoe with a lot of weight down and your foot all the way back, especially before they're broken inI don't like the shoelaces but I say that about every shoe. I've had laces (leather ones?) that don't loosen. I feel like these have excellent friction, just not much give. They look fine though, not \"hiking laces\" with some kind of gaudy plad like you'll find on 90% of Merrells and every other similar shoe.Update after 6 months:I've worn these for pretty much every day for 6 months and I have the following two updates.Pro: The \"can't get into the back of the shoe\" problem is completely resolved. I think this is just part of the deal with a \"real\" hiking shoe. It will take a dozen miles or so to break in and then your foot will appreciate the back of the shoe holding up for the duration.Con: The shoelaces are indeed garbage. I got some \"sport\" kiwi laces that were black after the originals started to dissolve into nothing and it was a huge upgrade. Why do such expensive shoes have junky laces? I don't know but they're easy enough to replace.Annoyance: one of the shoes squeaks on totally flat surfaces (like every step in an office building). I don't know what causes squeaks and I don't know if it's fixable but it is annoying. I've learned to just tune it out. Perhaps this is the price for wearing an outdoor tread pattern in an office environment so much.Update after 20 months:I can't believe I'm writing about a shoe I still nearly every day after 20 months! Like I said above, I drag my feet a good bit and usually the heel would wear through long before this many miles but the Vibram, though showing a little wear, is still holding on after all this time! I'm about to kill my replacement laces but I still think they were much better than the factory ones. I've also worn lose the fabric above the heel, probably from my laziness of not unlacing the shoe before taking them off. Because of my cutting up of the rear fabric and just general scuffs and aging after 20 months, I am considering buying a replacement par.Still the best fitting shoe I've ever owned and Vibram is such a wonderful feature. I'm raising my scoring to 5 stars.",

Only reason they aren't 5 stars is they falsely claim to be waterproof. They aren't even any more water resistant than any other leather shoes or boots. If you're walking on wet ground/leaves after rain or even 1/2\" of snow, your feet will get wet within an hour. That's actually why I have 2 pairs, I cycle between the two when I'm out in the woods, leaving the wet pair by the fire to dry.",
