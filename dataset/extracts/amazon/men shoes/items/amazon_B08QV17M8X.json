They also do not get my feet wet from walking in the morning dew which I love. Durability is good as well lasting a year with the inner sole not wearing out like others. Traction is also very good while walking as the bottoms have stayed intact and not wore out . I have used many different sneakers and they usually wear out within a couple months so it is a pleasure to find a product that is both durable and comfortable with a good price. Definite buy",

                "reviewText": "My feet are quite large (13.5, wide) and it's exceptionally difficult finding trail running shoes that are actually comfortable. I tried Lone Peaks, which are comfortable for everyday wear, but they offer basically no support, and while some see this as a good thing, they didn't work for me.Aside from Lone Peaks, I found very few shoes that actually fit comfortably in my size, but one of those few I found are these Cascadias. These are great! Super comfortable, I can run in them all day, plenty of grip, and they fit true to size. I wear Adrenalines for normal running and moving over to these for trails feels completely natural.Highly recommend, especially if you have large feet and are having a difficult time like I was!",

                "reviewText": "As an avid trail runner, I've been a fan of the Brooks Cascadia line for many years. The Cascadia 16 is the latest iteration of this popular shoe. While the 16s are a solid overall trail running shoe, I felt they fell a bit short of previous versions I've loved.On the positive side, the new design includes welcome updates like a roomier toe box and modernized lacing system. Brooks' signature BioMoGo DNA midsole provides good cushioning and support on uneven terrain. The sticky rubber outsole grips well on most surfaces.My main complaints are with the upper mesh material and overall fit. The upper feels slightly cheaper and less breathable than prior models. For my feet, the fit runs half a size too small. Going up a half size improved the tightness but caused some heel slippage issues.The Cascadia 16 also seems less durable than its predecessor. After just 60 or so miles, I'm already seeing some concerning wear on the outsole lugs and upper fabric. It remains to be seen how they'll hold up in the long run.Overall, this newest iteration is a decent stability trail shoe for beginner or moderately active runners. But it lacks some of the premium features and dialed-in performance I've come to expect from the Cascadia line. I'd recommend trying on in store and seeking out older models on sale if you want a more well-rounded Cascadia.",

                "reviewText": "I was forced to look for a new shoe for disc golf as the new balance I have been purchasing for two years was discontinued. Toe protection on the shoe for added durability is super important as I drag my toe on my follow throughs while throwing. After wearing them and putting 20-30 rounds on them there is very little wear and tear. Will probably buy them again if the current pair ever gets to beaten up by the course.",

                "reviewText": "There is nothing about these that I don't like. They absolutely suit my feet. This is my fourth pair, first from Amazon. Bought from them this time because of the price, on the day, was cheaper than anywhere else. I have hiked hundreds of miles in this make and model of trail runner, here's hoping they never change. Mind you, due to having Plantar in one foot I do change the insoles, but I do that with all my footwear. Like everything of this nature they're not waterproof when fording streams or deep bogs but they dry out quickly and I wear waterproof stockings. The soles are bulletproof and tend to grip like glue on all but the smoothest icy patches . I love them, my feet thanks me for them.",
