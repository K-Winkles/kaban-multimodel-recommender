                "reviewText": "I think, like many people, I've felt hesitant to buy products like shoes online; the feeling that you will need to try on more than a few pairs before you find a good fit hangs on after buying from stores. But with prices seeming to rise more and more for items such as shoes in shops, I've turned to the internet to find better deals, and a deal, I had found with these. My only minor complaint would be that when I received my order, there was minor scuffing on the toes of the shoes, but that most likely happened in delivery; for anyone who orders their items online, you understand that these things can happen sometimes. Besides this, I found these shoes to fit perfectly, and I've found them comfortable to wear over the few weeks I've been wearing them. The padding built in the shoe's insole, was not as \"squishy soft\" as i expected; i guess i was expecting something like a thicker foam or gel like feel for some reason, but the latex foam insole I felt, supports my feet well and I could walk for quite awhile with no discomfort, which of course is a big plus. I also was impressed of the quality and look of these shoes, especially for the price. Even at such discount shoe stores such as Payless, at least in my area, you would most likely have to pay about double the price listed here, for a pair like these there. What also impressed me was how through the given information, and just a little research, I was able to find the exact measurements of each size, so i could do any measuring of my feet before hand, just as I would of in a shoe store. I will need to try these for awhile longer to speak truthfully about their durability, but so far, I am very impressed, and I'm happy with my purchase. If you are looking for very nice dress shoes on a budget, please give these a try.",

I quickly realized these aren't those kind of shoes, but these shoes grew on me instantly when I decided to try them on. They're very solid shoes, the soles in particular are worth mentioning. They're what you'd expect, solid, not that memory foam stuff. Plus they look really nice.",
