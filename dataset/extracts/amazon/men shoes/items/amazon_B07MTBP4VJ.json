The 10's were to small so I exchanged for 10.5. These were also too small so I exchanged for 11's. Thank goodness for the Amazon \"try before you buy\" program. The 11's are perfect so I am keeping them. My suggestion is to order one full size larger than you normally wear. I purchased two other pair of shoes this week in size 10 (my normal size) and they fit me perfect.",
