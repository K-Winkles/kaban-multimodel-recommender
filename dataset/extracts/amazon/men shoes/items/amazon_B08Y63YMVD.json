A couple of times I've gotten them pretty dirty and thrown them in the washing machine. They came out fine. There is just now a little wear on the insoles where the lining is coming apart. But every other part of the shoe is sturdy. No issues with the stitching or glue on the soles or any other point where they come together, which is pleasantly surprising considering I wear them almost daily. True to size. I'm a US Men's 10.5 and they fit well. I'll be buying another pair.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Unfortunately these shoes didn't last long. After just four months (walking 1hr/day, 6 days/week), the padding on the inside of the heels started wearing out. The rest of the shoe is still in great shape, and they still look practically brand new. But they're more or less worthless given the pain they're now causing the back of my heel. Going to see if I can continue to use them with some padding, but otherwise this pair is done for.---These shoes are great, especially at this price. It was so hard to find a pair of sneaker-walking shoes in Men's 13 Wide at any price, let alone a decent price. When these popped up I jumped on the opportunity, and couldn't be happier.Great support, and great fit. I do a lot of walking in my neighborhood on asphalt road with lots of hills, and my feet feel fine even after several hours.The mesh venting on the top of the shoe is amazing. The first few days I wore them they felt a little hot, but I think you just need to wear in the breathable mesh a bit. After the third day they were super breathable and it felt great on my feet. Now they're really cool, especially if there's a breeze. Not sure how they'll do in the winter, but I expect they'll still be OK with heavier socks.The shoe is slightly on the heavier side, but not much, and still lighter than most other walking shoes.",
