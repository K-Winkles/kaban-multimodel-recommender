I wore these shoes to and from the golf course and for one round of 18 holes. Usually I experience some discomfort in my feet near the end of the round or afterwards. However, with these shoes I had no pain or discomfort of any kind. They fit great and are lightweight. The traction was fine. Only two questions remain for these shoes to maintain their five star rating: (1) are they durable enough to last 100 rounds or more of golf and (2) will the traction be sufficient in wetter, slipperier conditions? Will find this out over time, but for now I couldn't be happier with these shoes.",

                "reviewText": "First, let's admit that Nike has no concept of what a wide shoe is for American (at least) feet. Puma does! I took a chance on a great markdown ordering these golf shoes - it has paid off. The golf shoe sole is spikeless so the shoes could be worn beyond the course. The construction is solid. The uppers are a nylon-appearing mesh that may gather dust and dirt quickly and be harder to clean than a solid material. Three rounds in on the shoes as well as maybe three times as many range sessions. The shoes are good looking, light, and well fitting. Glad I took a chance.",
