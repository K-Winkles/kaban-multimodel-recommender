An approach that took us from the back room of a specialty running store to the front of the pack on roads and trails across the world. With innovation at our forefront, our founders created our first shoe with the help of a toaster oven. This was the start of our signature shoe construction to help you move naturally and has kept our brand going for a decade while aiming to keep you running. OUR PURPOSE Unleashing human potential by inspiring the world to move naturally is what Altra Running is all about. Our purpose is built around discovery, joy, responsibility, natural movement, and finding your potential. OUR INNOVATION Our wide-lacing system inspired our signature FootShape design to encourage natural movement. While a household toaster oven inspired our founders, FootShape and Balanced Cushioning has inspired thousands of people to unleash their human potential. That\u2019s the foundation of Altra Running: innovative, disruptive thinking.",

                "reviewText": "So this is going to be an extensive review. I usually wear orthotics due to one foot with a high arch and the other is almost being flat. I walk/run between 60 and 110 miles each week. Most running shoes have a pointed toe box. Not the Paradigm 6. The roomy toe box is extremely comfortable. It's the most comfortable shoe I have ever warn. I put in crazy miles and tend to pronate. This leads to hip pain and eventually knee pain. My maiden Trek with these shoes was 10.6 miles. I felt great afterwards. Normally my feet are after a 10 miler. Not the case. I did not wear any orthotics. I did feel a little hip pain during cool down, so I will be putting high arch orthotics in for next outing. Having two different arches affects the mechanics of the hips and the knees. Moving on to the heel. The sits nicely, almost like it is sitting in a cup. There is superb ankle support. I took the shoe over some rocky terrain and my ankles always felt secure. I don't like lacing my shoes tight. I use a slipper spoon to to get into my shoes. Even so my foot did not shift once.I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for high performance and light weight without sacrificing comfort and stability. I don't right many reviews, but these shoes are worthy.",

                "reviewText": "Runner for more years than I care to admit, and have tried them all (even tried no shoes at all). Wide feet have I, and injured my fair share, so my go-tos were Brooks or New Balance. But a wise, \u201cseasoned\u201d running store employee said, \u201cTry these.\u201d And he fitted me w a pair of Altra Paradigm 6. Instantly sold. Cushy but not squishy (except when wet \u2014 more on that later). I need a bit of motion control and the Guide Rail structure keeps my ankles from pronating as much. Nice energy return, and that first pair lasted about 700 miles, which is a bit more than I expected. They are constructed such that the mesh area around the big toe doesn\u2019t tear out (and yes, I keep my nails well-trimmed). So I bought this second pair at a good discount (that seems to have disappeared), and I have to say that I have never been happier with a running shoe, or the experience of running in them.Every rose has a thorn. And this one is simply that when they get wet, they stay wet. And when they get wet, they get squishy. Every shoe gets wet in the rain, but not every shoe gets squishy. I happen to create a lot of my own rain on long runs (ie, I sweat akin to a monsoon), so these shoes are regularly soaked through. Remove the inner footbed, stuff them with newspaper or paper towels, and give them at least a full day to dry.I do love these shoes, which surely means that Altra will screw around and modify them so the next iteration will suck and I\u2019ll be on the shoe hunt once again. They\u2019re not cheap, but if you value your runs (and do most of them under dry conditions), the wide toe box, and some nice spring in your stride, give them a try.",

I used to have pain from running shoes that were made to look great and squeezed my toes. I even went to a podiatrist to try and get some relief. These shoes solved that problem.I run daily:2-5 miles per day. These shows last nearly 9 months. They are usable beyond that but for me, the tread wears to the point that traction is iffy in wet weather. I think the wear is no worse than other more uncomfortable shoes I have worn.I decided to get orange this time. Great color.",
