                "reviewText": "Originally bought this shoe for lounging around, but after a few runs in it i ended up liking this better than the running shoes i had bought. Low stack height, rolls forward well and has a good balance of firmness and cushioning without feeling dead and has a nice slightly bouncy feel on fast runs and intervals. Tried a few full half marathon runs on them but they're probably not suited for 6+ mile runs, could use more cushioning and support for that. Not sure why the same size was around a full smaller than their 880v12 so that's something to watch out for, but the extra wide is still properly extra wide although the toe box height is on the low side. These aren't major downsides for me, but have to point out that arch support is definitely less and the shoe feels less stable compared to their 880v12 and the Brooks Ghost 13 and 14.",

No Jordan\u2019s or air forces, anything that you don\u2019t want to crease or can\u2019t bend your toes in is not for him. He needs shoes for the function and not the look, and especially now working in a hospital. But he loves the shoes. Says they\u2019re very comfortable and have nice support. I\u2019m just happy to throw out the old ones and they look cute too. For the price it\u2019s a steal.",

                "reviewText": "I've run for almost 3 years in the defunct NB Evare, my first Fresh Foam shoe which offered very good cushioning. The 680v7 is similarly priced replacement. The 680 doesn't feel quite as cushiony and the heel is lower but I find it good for my 4 mile runs. Some complain about the narrow toe box but I find the toe box roomy compared to my other NB shoes.One BIG quibble - sizing. I bought my first NB shoes 10 years ago, size 10.5 D. Over the years, NB sizing has become smaller and smaller to the point where I'm ordering size 13. I take maybe size 10 in regular shoes. Extremely annoying.Size 13 is slightly loose but 12 is too tight. But it works well for me since there's room for the PROFOOT Orthotic Insoles for Plantar Fasciitis which compensate for the cushioning and heel height and also add arch support. Running feels very comfortable with the inserts.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great running shoe to run with. Because they are so affordable, I bought two pairs in order to rotate them throughout the week, but I liked them so much that I purchased one additional pair to use for work. My weekly mileage is nothing crazy--about 25-30 miles per week, and after putting over 100 miles on them they are still comfortable. Once I feel that I need to replace the ones I have, I will purchase the same shoes, or at least another NB shoe. I hate spending over $100 on a pair of running shoes, so I love the fact that this brand makes great running shoes that are affordable. I no longer buy any other brand of running shoes. They do run a bit small, for me anyway, so I have to buy a half-size bigger than I normally do with previous brands.",
