They have held up well to daily treadmill use and casual outings. At the tail end of summer they have seemed to breathe well and have not become uncomfortably hot even with prolonged use. Actually invested in a second pair to have the versatility for outings and daily life and a cleaner pair around the house and on the treadmill. Not a fan of tracking whatever I walk through outside all over the house. Both pairs look great and seem to be a high quality material fit and finish. Shoes are grippy on treadmill belts without feeling like I'm rooted in place.TLDR I might have low standards from previous cheap pairs but I love these and now own 2 pair and I'm not even fancy like that.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Home run",
                "reviewText": "First off I am writing this review only to help others. I have received no compensation of any kind for it.Second off, I\u2019ve been running since 1998 (25 years). I\u2019m currently in my mid 40s and working towards a goal of running 3,000 miles (the distance across the continental U.S.) bit-by-bit between 40 and 50. I run 3-5 miles 3X a week, no more/no less. Since age 42 I\u2019ve run 1700 miles. I\u2019ve written running shoe reviews semi-professionally in the past, too. So I am pretty qualified to review a running shoe.Thirdly, my preferred brand is ASICS. I have tried a lot of shoe brands as a semi-professional reviewer because they were sent to me, but I always have come back to ASICS because they just\u2026work. I believe the straight lasting is a lot of the reason why. Also, the tendency of the ASICS brand to put their premium technology into their budget models (GEL cushioning, for example) brings me back again and again. They just make the best affordable runners on the market.Fourthly, I have always been an advocate for budget running shoes, provided they are well-designed. I have tried the expensive ones at various times and have developed more typical running injuries in those than I have in a solid pair of reasonably-priced running shoes. Particularly, I do not like ultra-cushioned shoes. I like a low-to-the-ground natural feel when I run. In ultra-cushioned shoes, I can\u2019t get ground-feedback when running and that\u2019s a fail for me. It\u2019s like running in space. It\u2019s weird.Fifthly, and this is probably the main point, the ASICS Excite series is a favorite of mine. I have used the Excite 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and now 9. They keep getting better. I find that they have just enough cushioning to dampen impact but not so much as to throw off my gait. I use them with my doctor-prescribed orthotics (pictured) and the combo works very well. If I were a distance runner (like a marathoner) I might need a shoe with more cushioning, but for 3-5 miles 3X a week these are absolutely ideal. ASICS has priced this model very reasonably which is great given the high-level tech used here; the GEL heel cushion plus Amplifoam midsole are superb for dampening shock from the road. The outsoles are durable too. The uppers aren\u2019t as tough as those on the Excite 8 but it still works fine for me. Fit is on-point too. Overall for what these cost you will likely not find a better performance runner.So in summary, if you\u2019re a regular runner/jogger and looking for a good solid shoe to use for shorter distances (up to 6 or 7 miles), look no further. These are absolutely superb and I honestly like them better than many shoes that cost twice as much or more!Update: Six months of jogging 3-5 miles 3X/week and these shoes are still going strong. Minimal tread wear, no wear to the upper, cushioning still firm and responsive. What a great value!",
