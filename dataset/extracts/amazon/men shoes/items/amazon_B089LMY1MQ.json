                "reviewText": "First off, I was not expecting much buying a no-name shoe online, especially for the price. Boy was I in for a surprise...I've owned these for almost a full year, and can confidently say these are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I normally wear a size 11 and these fit me perfectly. Prior to this the most comfortable shoes I had were some Cole Haans with the Nike air technology. These shoes are so lightweight, so comfortable, I can wear them all day long without feeling a thing. Whenever I (rarely) need to wear a different pair of shoes, I am immediately reminded of how much I used to hate wearing shoes and couldn't wait to take them off.Based on the price, I expected them to wear down quickly. However they are still going strong. Running, hiking, long walks, biking, worn to office / casual events. These shoes have been soaked in mud multiple times, but clean up easily by just throwing them in the washing machine and then the dryer. The soles and the insoles have both worn down a bit over the past year; at this rate I expect to get 1.5 to 2 years out of them before needing to be replaced. So far I must have put at least a thousand miles on these shoes based on how much I wear them.They look good too. I have the all-black pair, and they dress up nicely with jeans and a button up shirt for a night out, but also look natural in an athletic setting with shorts and no socks. Most versatile shoe I've ever owned.Now for the cons, which are minor. The pattern on the bottom of the sole is prone to some squeaking/suction sounds at first. However after about a month some of the ridges wore down just enough that it was no longer a problem. Second: they are not as breathable as I would have liked. For example, when running or biking, you don't feel any air on your feet. Wearing them out in the sun on a hot summer day, your feet will get a bit stuffy. In fact the fabric is woven tight enough that I wear them in the winter and in the rain, and don't get too cold or wet. So I do wish they made a more breathable version for summer time use.All that being said, these are still the best pair of shoes I've ever had. Ultra light weight, comfortable, and can be worn all day long without feeling any fatigue whatsoever.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these shoes in 2021 and just ordered another couple of pairs since I obviously like them.They are incredibly comfortable and slip on and off quite quickly. They're feather-light and breathable. Plus I like that they come in nice neutral colors for those of us who don't want to go around looking like Bozo the Clown.I've been wearing the same pair almost every day for 3 years and they haven't fallen apart yet. I'm only replacing them now because the bottoms are severely grass-stained and the tread has been worn almost completely smooth. But 3 years is still a pretty good run for cheap lightweight sneakers, so I'm quite impressed. (And I'm still keep this original pair for painting and yard work.)Need to pop on shoes real quick to take the trash out to the curb, take the dog for a walk, nip out to Target, or looking for something comfortable and casual to wear to your office job if you spend most of your time sitting at a desk? These are the shoes for you.They are perfect for low-impact everyday use, but I would strongly advise against using them for any sort of extended or strenuous walking/running/standing activities. I originally bought these shoes for running on a treadmill, and after a 20 minute workout you will immediately feel the effects of every impact almost as if you were running barefoot. Likewise, on those rare occasions where I find myself standing or walking around on hard concrete floor for an entire day at work, my feet will be killing me if I don't put on a more supportive pair sneakers. And for hiking or climbing, they have almost zero tread and you will feel every sharp pebble you step on because the soles are so thin.Still, these shoes are cheap enough that I'm fine with them not being appropriate for every situation. I've got a nice pair of supportive hikers that I put on for more strenuous activity or when I know I'm going to be walking or climbing on slippery or uneven surfaces, and these are the sneakers that I put on when I just need to go to the store or perform some other mundane low-impact activity that only requires me to stand around or walk of flat surfaces for about an hour at a time.",

                "reviewText": "TL;DRComfortable, stylish, and less than $30 when on sale? What's the catch? Oh, they are a mass-produced product from China that is the equivalent of a name-brand without the ridiculous name-brand premium tax added? Rather than paying $50-$100 a pair, you get the same design and quality for a fraction of the price? Sign me up!THE GOOD\u25cf Extremely comfortable and a cushion feeling.\u25cf The sizing fits perfectly and is a snug fit. For comparison, a size 8.5-9 Nikes will fit this 9.5 size, but it is a snug fit. Suggest grabbing a pair above your normal shoe size.\u25cf We got the pure white pair and it's fire!\u25cf Affordable AF. Usually on sale, so wait to grab a pair or more.\u25cf Lightweight and breathable. Running felt nice as the material lets air pass through the shoe.THE BAD\u25cf The title said, \"slip on\", but there are still shoe laces that need to be tied, so not really slip-ons?ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSAre they suited for standing for a long time?Yes, we imagine so. It is lightweight and very comfortable to wear for a prolonged period of time.Are these wide?No. For wide feat people (like us), we recommend getting a size above your regular shoe size.Are these washable?We have not tried it yet, but we cannot imagine why it cannot be washed. Do not recommend machine washing, but perhaps wash it by hand and air dry it using the power of the sun.",
