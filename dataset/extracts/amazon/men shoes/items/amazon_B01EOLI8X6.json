                "reviewText": "The product arrived in two boxes: One large fat one that contained the main tank assembly, and one long one that contained the two long boards. Assembly was easy to follow and actually fun. One thing to keep in mind (for putting anything together really) is to get the fasteners finger-tight, then tighten them bit by bit, going fastener to fastener, until they're all tight. This will assure that everything will be level and very secure. Really, though, the assembly is pretty fool-proof if you can follow basic instructions.The exercise itself is very pleasant. I love the whooshing sound. Level 1 is pretty easy. Level 4 is noticeably more strenuous. You have to pull about 5 to 10 strokes before you'll feel a difference after you change the setting.I wish the LCD display was backlight. My workout area is dimly lit, and I want to keep it that way. But, the numbers are very easy to read if you can get some light on it.This is the one and only rower of any type I've purchased before, and this is likely the only one I'll ever need. I'm sure I'll get many years of use out of it. It's well built, beautiful, and bound to improve my health.Happy rowing!",

After a bit of searching I stumbled on a link from Apple Fitness+ directly to the unit on the Life Fitness website.Life Fitness accepted my order (at a lower price than seen here) and shipped directly to me using UPS -- placed the order on a Wednesday and the unit was delivered on the next Monday. Setup dead simple -- unit is basically fully assembled except for the side runners -- 8 bolts.Very happy with the functionality of the rowing feel/motion. The included console is very basic and doesn't connect to anything (even a heart strap) but it does show stroke rate, elapsed time.My guess is that, compared to the other leading name in water rowers, I paid a couple hundred dollars more for this machine. But the quality is very good, delivery was unbelievably fast and I'm glad I bought it!Just to repeat: I tried to buy this from Amazon first, but the order wasn't accepted!",

                "reviewText": "Costco was selling a nearly identical model (Life Fitness CX rower... basically the HX without Bluetooth) when I purchased it in August 2018 (but they are no longer sold there). I've now had my rower for nearly 2.5 years, & it has held up wonderfully with no issues. It's especially great to have in the midst of COVID. This model easily stands up for convenient storage & looks beautiful... like a nice piece of furniture. It's a great workout, & I love that the tank has a resistance dial (to me that was a very important feature as I tested a WaterRower brand one without the dial, & it felt inferior to what I bought). I also love the whooshing sound of the water & highly recommend this by rower.",
