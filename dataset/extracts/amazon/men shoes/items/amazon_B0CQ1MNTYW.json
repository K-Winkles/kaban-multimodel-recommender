                "reviewText": "I ordered these because I was looking for a shoe to wear while doing walking and light workouts. What I didn't expect was that it's one of the more stylish looking shoes I own!The fit was pretty good and the insole is great, but there are a couple drawbacks that make it not quite a \"walking shoe\" to me. First, it doesn't have very functional laces, and the shoe seems to rely more on its stretchy material than laces to tighten. In fact, I tied them once and now I use them as slip-on loafers. As such, it's not the strongest fit, and my heel tends to lift out of it fairly easily while moving. I still find them comfortable enough to walk in, but after a mile or two, they don't hold up as well as my similar Sketchers loafers. They're also slightly tight around the toes, but didn't cause any blisters or other nastiness.So I'd recommend them as a nice casual shoe to wear with jeans, but you might want to look for something more supportive if you intend to do a lot of activities in them.",

                "reviewText": "Sizing of this shoe is accurate based on my size 10.5. My feet are medium width and I find the width of this shoe to be good for me.These have the look of dress shoes, sort of, but certainly are not. The laces are mostly for show. If untied you can\u2019t separate the left and right sides very much so pulling the laces tight does not tighten up the fit. It\u2019s an elastic fit that pulls the shoe tight to your feet. These are slip-ons. Just leave the laces laced.You don\u2019t need the pull tab to pull the shoe on, but it would make it more convenient/easier. However, I can\u2019t fit my index finger into it and I think my fingers are on the thin side. I could grab it with index and thumb but that\u2019s not near as easy as putting the index finger into the loop. So I put my finger inside the shoe and pull (stretch) it back so it goes over the heel.I find the shoe comfortable. It is light weight, which can be good, but I don\u2019t know about durability. There is not a lot of support since it\u2019s stretchy and light so it may not be good to use in some situations like walking through a woods.I like the look of this fancy casual shoe. It\u2019s comfortable at a good price. 4 stars since the pull tab is not usable for me.",

I ordered size 8 my regular size and they fit like a glove, not too tight or too loose but very comfortable fit. I love the toe is like a classic wingtip, but these shoes feel like comfy sneakers but look good enough for dress wear. I can wear these shoes with jeans or khakis for work or an evening out. These are very versatile shoes. I love the heel is enforced with the same material as the toes for a secure fit and comfort while walking. The sole is solid, and the insole is curved to my foot with only 4 eyelets for laces which I love. These are so well-made but also so light with the mesh sides to allow your foot to breathe. These are fantastic shoe so stylish, light and so comfortable. Highly recommend.",

They do not tighten the shoe.Shoe doesn't stay on. Lifts up at heel on every step even when simply walking.No pad around the ankle.This shoe is for looks only, not for actually wearing.Not recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I've purchased Bruno Marc shoes before but these are hands down my favorites. They are one of the most versatile shoes that I have. They look great with khakis for business casual and even better with jeans. They feel like sneakers despite having a classic wingtip appearance. The sole is thick enough to provide support but these shoes are amazingly lightweight. I ordered my normal size and they fit perfectly so they are true to size. So far, really happy with these stylish and comfortable shoes.",

                "reviewText": "These Bruno Marc Men's Mesh Oxfords Sneakers are a very nice and comfortable sneaker. The title implies that they would work for \"dress up\", but I'm not sure I agree with that.Regardless, they are soft and comfortable. The stretchy material makes them easy to get on, but that probably sacrifices some lateral support. The laces are, to me, for show only. The shoe doesn't have a \"split\" that the laces would pull together, they simply scrunch up the elastic material a bit. Certainly, they add to the look, but not so much as to the fit.Size was as expected and they fit well. I've worn them for two days now and the level of comfort has remained consistent.A good buy!",
