                "reviewText": "I bought both the brown pair and the black pair for my husband in a size 14. The brown pair is great. They look and feel amazing on him. He wears them every day, and has gotten many compliments on them. He had a previous pair from years ago that he loved. These ones are slightly different, but the brand is very similar if not better in support. Although the black pair do have great support, and they do feel very comfortable to wear, The amount of effort put into them style wise is severely lacking. The black ones do not appear the same as a picture. They look very cheap and very \u201cMcDonald\u2019s worker\u201d like. They have a plastic like appearance. We were not satisfied with the black at all, despite seemingly equal level of comfort level that they provide. Appearance is very important in his career, and clearly he will have to sacrifice comfort for style in this scenario if he has to wear a black shoe. Just the same, we did not return them because it\u2019s so difficult to find shoe in his size. We have them as a reserved for a wear in a pinch until we can find a better pair.",

A little care (like polishing them) and they last.",
