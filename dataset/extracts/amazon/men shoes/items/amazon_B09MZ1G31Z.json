                "reviewText": "Have played two rounds so far (and I'm a walker - don't use carts). Good support, and very comfortable almost immediately - i.e., they didn't really need to be broken in. You can tell how well (or poorly) a golf shoe is made by how your feet feel after walking a long course. Any flaws in design, materials, or manufacturing immediately show up as an \"Advil ouch!\" somewhere (arch, toes, or etc.) on your feet post round. IMO, before you even start talking about how a shoe is to play golf in, it has to pass the first test ... quite simply, whether they are they are just plain good walking shoes. (Walking a standard 18 hole course averages around 6.5 miles.) These passed that test.So far as golfing, I have occasionally had problems with \"spikeless\" golf shoes slipping, especially on wet tee boxes, but these grabbed and held just fine. One of my rounds was the day after some heavy rains, with a lot of the course still quite damp, but I experienced no difficulties.Should also mention (re: moisture) that while the tongue and upper part of the shoe (that wraps around the ankle) are cloth, the main body of the shoe is a sort of plastic/rubber material that is completely waterproof. In other words, if you played in the rain, or walked through standing water puddles an inch or two deep your feet might wind up wet - but if you are just walking on moist, post-rain or watered fairways, these shoes are functionally waterproof.Minor issue to bring up? These shoes do use that kind of \"wrap-around\" construction where the foot slides inside a sort of glove (i.e., opening the tongue doesn't fully open the shoe itself). I happen to like that style, as the shoe fits slightly more firmly and the tongue doesn't wander as much during the round. But it does make the shoe a bit harder to put on. I use a shoehorn. Now personally this doesn't bother me at all, in fact one of the benefits of spikeless shoes is that I don't have to mess with changing them sitting on the trunk of my car at the course - I can put them on at home, and easily drive with them.(I only mention this because the primary value of Amazon reviews - many of which I've benefitted from - comes from hearing the experiential impressions of those that have used products, rather than just reading the marketing materials the company puts on the website. So while I have no problem with this - others might find it slightly irritating.)Can't yet comment on durability as I've only had them a couple weeks or so, but I'm a walker (and even worse, usually carry, i.e., not even a push cart), so it's not like any shoe last years or something.Final thing I'd mention - and this is just a personal preference - I really like the aesthetics. They simply look good. Very understated. I really don't like flashy, brightly colored, dramatic shoes (so many these days almost seem to want to make a \"look at me!\" statement). But the fundamental purpose of golf shoes is to ... well ... play golf. When I'm standing over a putt, I don't want my shoes yelling \"look at me\", I want them so quiet I almost forget they're there. These have a kind of calm elegance about them.Bottom line, I've played golf for a long time. Have some fairly expensive shoes (G/FORE, Johnston & Murphy). These are easily fairly close to that league. If I had paid $150, I'd still be leaving the positive review of a satisfied customer. At less than $100? I consider these to be a somewhat unusual find.",

They are for golf. I absolutely love them. I give them a five star. Not being able to drive with them on is just something I thought I would tell everyone so they wouldn\u2019t get in a wreck. If you have a pair, you know how slippery they are on the bottom. Also they seem like they will last a long time. The grip on bottom is very thick and it has very great grip shape to it, definitely will keep you from slipping while hitting the ball as hard as you can. I tried on the ECCO golf shoes and they were very comfortable too, but they were $289.00. These are normally $160.00. And they are about the same comfort as the double the money ECCO shoe. Again with a great grip!!!!!",
