Should I got to order another one from one of your suppliers and my I don\u2019t know if I can say this polo style jeans I can be business, elegant casual I want to same time getting a belt from your supplier it\u2019s about $22. That\u2019s coordinates the shoes the shoes are awesome.What is really important to know is the bottom of the shoes are very dark and that makes it so you don\u2019t have to clean them all the time like you do the ones that are white I think the next layer is not even white is something but so far, they\u2019re happy. I wore them all day today with my \u201chorse game style\u201dfairly expensive jeans. You know they\u2019re made by. I got a name Ralph but get a life belt from the supplier that you have for like $22. I think it really sucks off the outfit and you can wear any kind of a collared polo style shirt, polo style, and dumb. You know you can walk in a place where I live and you look nice. They\u2019re nice casual shoes and they\u2019re super comfortable. Absolutely great value probably be final person. Same ones the less longer and they won\u2019t were going always look better to him. All the colors of very nice packaging inside the box. The shoes are wrapped up in some cloth kind of bag. It\u2019s very nice. . Thanks. Get one for Chewy so I think he got their name on it. It\u2019s very classy.",

My takeaway is with any consistent use, these shoes don\u2019t last very well.",
