Fitting shoes online is challenging due to style and sizing differences between various manufacturers. I have returned enough shoes this summer to fully appreciate this challenge, so, when I found these shoes, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only were they cute and comfortable, they fit true to size. This shoe fits like a shoe should fit. I liked them so much and was so relieved to finally find a good fitting shoe that I bought this shoe in both pink and white. If it becomes available in other colors, I will probably buy more. It is a versatile, timeless style that looks and feels good, and, most importantly, it fits true to size.I dislike buying shoes due to almost inevitable hassles with sizing and fit, but this shoe (times two) was an exception right out of the box. I am in love with them. They are just right in every way.",

The size is just right.This shoes in particular have a very nice fabric that keeps your feet both fresh and warm at the same time. How is that? Let me clarify this for you. I you wear them in a hot or warm day you can put a little bit of foot wpowder in them and wear with no socks, your feet will feel fresh, blister free and can walk all day with no problem. If you wear them in a cold weather yu can just slip a pair of tick socks and go on your way, you can walk all day with no blisters, confortable and warm feet.They are breathable, light, confortable and very stylish.I already order a another pair in a different color. It's definetly a must have.",
