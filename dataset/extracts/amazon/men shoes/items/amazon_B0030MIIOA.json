                "reviewText": "I am very happy with my new pair of shoes. I was a bit concerned initially because the brown pair I purchased in the past was much softer and didn\u2019t last long at all. I\u2019ve worn my shoes a few times now and I felt comfortable even with my wide and flat feet. I read a review highlighting the arches but I didn\u2019t bother me at all. Shoe is comfortable and sturdy which I am hoping will help so the shoe doesn\u2019t come apart after a few months of repeated use. I would highly recommend if you need a pair of shoes for work at the office or even going to a special even or spiritual gathering. Price isn\u2019t bad either so it is a win win.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 39 years old and female. My boyfriend is 31. I've worked in the fashion industry for 20 years and he works installing cabinets, 40 hours a week. His feet always hurt.... so on with the review.... I really liked the fact that these fit \"true to size\" using \"US standard shoe industry measurements\". My boyfriend is usually a 10.5 US Wide, in the majority of retail brands he tries on and wears. I ordered these in 11 wide AND 10.5 wide. He picked the 10.5 wide to wear. I bought one in brown and one in black. 50.00 usd, approximately for each. For the price, fit and look, they are FANTASTIC! I work in boutique retail fashion sales, and these pass my \"do they look nice, and are they worth the money?\", test. Keep in mind, these are NOT italian leather quality, and shouldn't be. Those kinds of shoes are gorgeous, and worth the price based on looks, but require delicate handling when wearing them. These are a solid leather shoe with a nice semi-polish to them and good coloring. The outer rubber sole is black and looks fashionable, but not \"runway-designed\". These are appropriate for brunch with the family, or a nice night out at your favorite restaurant. I shopped EVERYWHERE trying to find some decent dress shoes for him that didn't hurt AND looked \"bangin'\". He LOVES these! I LOVE these!....I'm buying more. And you can't stop me! HA!.......LOL you should really get a pair too! THANK YOU DOCKERS! AND THANK YOU AMAZON!!",

They very good looking shoes, practical for work, and comfortable for the amount of walking he does. Important things to note: he has extra wide flat feet. If you have similar issues than you know who hard it can be to find shoes that fit will straight away; these shoes aren't killing his feet. I didn't give them five stars because I see the ware in pictures of some other reviews. These are too new to assume we won't have the same issue. But, for the price, and the comfort, it's worth it just to replace them.",
