                "reviewText": "Got these to replace a worn-out pair of Adidas shoes and I\u2019d say these were a great choice. Breathable fabric means my feet don\u2019t sweat, and they\u2019re flexible enough that I can run, cycle, lift weights, and do calisthenics with no issues.They\u2019re quite comfortable and have a lot of cushion in the heel, to the point it almost feels like walking on a cloud sometimes.Only 4 stars for this pair because of the construction of the fabric stabilizers around the ankle area. The internal tubing is pretty stiff and rubs against my ankle bone. After longer periods of use, this causes soreness and a blister if I don\u2019t wear a sock tall enough to cover the ankle. I could see this being a large issue if someone were to use these primarily as a running shoe.",

I just have a specific need for strong arch support and these do not provide that. The memory foam padding is super thin and you can just barely send it around your toes. But then when standing for longer periods of time, you can really get the feel in your heels like you are standing on hardwood flooring for too long.The \"unibody\" style is nice since there's no tongue to slip side-to-side while walking around (I run into that issue a lot with some shoes) and it has the same style at the top of the heel as the Skechers \"Slip-Ins\", which makes it easier to slide your foot into the shoes and leave them tied.But I can't keep wearing these shoes. But if your feet aren't as particular and you can were normal/flatter shoes (like Vans?), then these might work for you, but I didn't have a great experience with them.",
