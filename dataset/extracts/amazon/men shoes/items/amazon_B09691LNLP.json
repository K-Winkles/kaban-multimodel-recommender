These have surpassed my expectations for the $40 I paid for them and continue to fit well, tie easily, breathe freely and are extremely comfortable. Being flat-footed I am always a little concerned about arch support and how too much variation can cause a lot of pain for me over distance. These however have such a nice neutral support that I didn't feel the need to change the soles out. Grab a pair you won't regret it!",

                "reviewText": "Standard for all my reviews: When reviewing products, I always remain objective and honest about the product or service. I always review with information that I feel others would like to know about the product as I always assume what I'm writing will influence for or against the purchase. I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value and application. Most importantly, I will always end the review with an answer as to whether I'd purchase the product again which I believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item. To manufacturers: Want me to review your items, just let me know!I was looking to upgrade my shoe game because Nike has gotten so expensive recently. I really liked the simplicity of these UA shoes, good tread with a not-busy design. After receiving them I was immediately impressed with how light they are and how they feel overall. They would be a great walking shoe I think but I use Asics for that. The ONLY issue I have with these UA sneakers is that they are a little uncomfortable on the top of my foot near the tongue. I've tried loosening the laces a bit near the top and that helps but it's still a small issue. Other than that, I really like these shoes and I'm using them as my every day shoe when I'm not working out. They look great with shorts or jeans.I would actually purchase these again despite the minor discomfort issue. I'm hoping they just need to break in a bit more but it's not significant enough to keep me from purchasing them again, especially at the price point.",

The contrast is somewhat subtle which is what i wanted, plus the colors allow me to wear the shoe with various leggings, grey, blue, black , light blue and still look good. I will be using an insert for extra arch support, but i do that with all my shoes. i was looking for style at a certain price point and this shoe checked the boxes and i am familiar with the brand but have never bought their shoes.",

                "reviewText": "When it comes to comfort and a being a great fit, these Pursuit 3 X-Wides come nowhere close to the Pursuit TWO X-Wides I bought a couple of years ago. Why change something perfect? And what's with the extra-SHORT laces? There's (literally) barely enough lace to tie these things! These Pursuit 3s are tight...and I may still return them (having tried them on only once, and not worn them more than a couple minutes). The previously purchased Pursuit 2s were the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned; so comfortable that I've even worn them (the 2s) with a suit. My advice to Under Armour: Bring back the Under Armour Men's Charged Pursuit TWO Running Shoe, Black, 9.5 X-Wide US!",
