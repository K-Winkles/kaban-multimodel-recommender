I will be purchasing another pair to have on hand (along with another pair of massaging gel insoles).",

They're also pretty comfortable too. This is an out of production style now, but if I can find more of these in my size I'm going to stock up.",

In the summer months generally 30-50 miles a week. More like 30 in the winter. I've replaced them after about six months of use and they're still good kick about, work in the yard shoes with quite a bit of tread still there. I'm now walking with my second pair and everything so far would say that the performance and durability will be consistent with my first pair. I also like the looks. These have enough personality so you feel like you've got a little mojo on your feet but they're not screaming \"look at me!\" To the rest of the world. Subtle but chic. Very satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "I have been wearing Saucony shoes of different sizes since I was a kid. They remain comfortable and look good after a lot of wear and tear. They clean off easily due to sand or mud not sticking on to the leather very much. The grey stitchwork is harder to clean, but it doesn't look dirty very easily. I like to run and work out with these shoes. They give me great breathing room while feeling snug on my feet. As someone who walks heel-first, the padding on the bottom of the inside of the shoe remains spongy and comfortable for years. In the past 8 years, in fact, I've only had to replace the shoes three or four times. Picking these shoes every time my old pair goes bad saves me a lot of hassle, especially with my more casual fashion sense. Great shoes all around, they survive long and serve you well.",
