                "reviewText": "I wear a size 11.5 US, got the size 45 EU and it's a good fit. There is room for my toes but the shoe is not overly long. The strips of holographic material are a nice accent. The out-sole is a monolithic piece of rubber, covering the entire bottom. They have good grip on any firm surface, including solid ice. Grip is poor on moss, mud, and slush but that is to be expected. There is a light toe spring and very slight heel spring. Good if you're used to barefoot walking style but could be a bit awkward at first for heavy heel striders. I expect these shoes to last many years although they may need a bit of glue after a year or two, depending on how well the out-sole stays bonded, and how long it takes to wear through the heel lining.(Pictured: reflective strip in ambient lighting, reflective strip with flash.)",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Super Comfortable Casual Shoe",
                "reviewText": "This is exactly what I wanted: it's a casual shoe like something from Skechers, but has the toe box of an Altra, and costs a fraction of either. I dig the look and I plan to use them for walking, work, and general casual use. I wanted something that I could potentially wear all day without discomfort and these seem perfect for that.The build quality is good, not excellent. It uses a faux suede material around the eyelets that looks a bit cheap. The toe box uses a formed knitted material which doesn't seem to be especially breathable (my \"light test\" showed very little light getting through) but it looks nice. There's a reflective strip with the logo on it, which I like. Compared to my expensive Altra running shoes and my Reebok cross-trainers, those shoes rely more on plasticky bits held on with glue. The overall quality of the Whitins is not far off the mark. The rubberized sole might be the first thing to wear out, as it's not especially thick. But compare that to Skechers which often go with a cheaper, less durable foam sole, and the Whitin soles look durable by comparison.If you plan to run in these, keep in mind that these are zero-drop shoes and while they have padding, it's probably not enough for people who run on their heels. It's best for fore/midfoot runners.It's really impressive that you can get something that looks nice and feels this good on your feet for such a low price.Fit: I'd go 1-1.5 sizes down from your usual. I wear 11.5-12 men's, and the 11 fit me best here, with a little room to spare.",

I also like the WHITIN barefoot shoes, but like these in the winter as these have more of a sole to insulate from the cold ground. I tried another brand that looked similar to these, but they were not made as well as these and the sole was too thick.",

                "reviewText": "*I am not a runner* I wear these as daily shoes and go for long walks. I cannot speak for long distance running folks.I'm actually surprised how good these feel. I've tried wide running shoes, new balance, Asics, adidas, Nike, but the toe box is always too narrow. These are still a bit ugly, but on the lesser ugly side of similar products.I've tried minimal shoes, but it feels like there is no support. These however have a small amount of cushioning that is just right. The insoles it comes with is honestly not bad at all and are actually suppoetivr. I feel like a lot of big brand shoes have paper thin insoles while simultaneously having no room for an after market insole.For 35 bucks, these feel great. I've had them for a couple months now and they're still kicking.Minor consThe tread initially has no grip, but after walking on pavement and sidewalks, it wears down and becomes grippier.While the toebox is wider than normal, it is still a slight touch narrow for my wide duck feet. This might not be a problem for youOverall, this is cheaper than any other bigger name brand shoe I purchased and is more comfortable. If these break in a year I'll just get another pair.EDIT: As of January 28th 2024I've had these shoes for a couple months now. The tread on the bottom is starting to wear, but they are still comfortable. for 35 bucks, I still say go for it.",
