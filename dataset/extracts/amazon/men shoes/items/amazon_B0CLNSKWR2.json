                "reviewText": "Not going to lie; when I first got these, I was lukewarm about them. They weren't very comfortable and seemed a little awkward looking. But after wearing them for 7 months, they've proven to be a fantastic shoe.They took a while to break in (like as long as a real leather shoe, surprisingly), but after a couple weeks they conformed to my feet and felt great, as well as relaxing a bit visually and looking better. Definitely a wider cut, too, with plenty of room in the toe box.The sole is quite grippy, but not too grippy that you're messing up your knees. The upper will definitely wear out before the sole, which has almost no wear after 7 months of ~16h/wk use, but to be fair the upper is in great shape too. They're easy to clean. They look mostly new - even though I've mostly ridden on a motorcycle with them and been scuffing one constantly on the shifter. These are just great shoes, and I get compliments most times I wear them (which doesn't happen with me and shoes). I'll definitely buy another pair when these go.",

                "reviewText": "I am a female and I\u2019ve been looking for some brown leather sneakers like I\u2019ve seen many men wearing. This isn\u2019t easy, because I wear a size 8 in women\u2019s which is usually a size 6 in men\u2019s. Most men\u2019s shoes have size 7 as the smallest size, so I was happy to find these in a smaller size and at an affordable price. After reading the reviews and seeing these are a bit narrow, I decided to try a 6.5. Overall, they fit quite well. The back of the shoe hits my heel a bit high, but it also helps the shoe stay in place. It\u2019s also padded which makes it soft. I\u2019m definitely able to move my toes around, which is nice, and I feel like I can tighten or loosen the laces to make them more comfortable on my feet. One of the things I like is the suede detail on the tongue and heel. The leather seems good too. One of the things I don\u2019t like is the shiny look of the laces. They look waxed or something. Who knows? You get an extra pair, also, but I may replace them because I just think they look kind of cheap.",
