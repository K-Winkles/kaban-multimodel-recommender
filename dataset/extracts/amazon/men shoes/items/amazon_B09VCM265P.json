The memory foam is feels better than 300 dollar paired Jordan shoes when an individual's is walking or running.

The shoes are comfortable and provide great support for my feet during my runs.The design is also quite stylish and the shoes are made with high-quality materials that seem durable.The only downside of these shoes is that the shoe strings are on the shorter side, which can make it difficult to properly tie them. I would have preferred a longer lace to ensure a more secure fit.Despite this minor issue, I would still highly recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a comfortable and stylish running shoe.",

However, after ordering them in mid-September 2023, they have already developed inside wear at the heal, and are causing blisters on both of my feet (heels). Underneath the fabric, there is a piece of plastic that rubs the heel pretty uncomfortably. It's not pleasant (if you refer to my left foot, you can see what I mean- this was the result of walking on them for the last 2 days after this issue began). I also posted a picture of the actual shoes. As you can see, they're in tip top condition. It's just this heel, however could you pick a worse spot for wear to occur? I'm trying to return them based on defect, but of course the 30-day window has lapsed. I've worn adidas shoes for years, and I have seen this problem before, but usually after 6-12 months of hard use. oh well...",
