Gotta say these are MUCH BETTER and that's saying quite a bit considering the 9s were pretty good. These are super comfy, super soft and they are especially roomy for those of us that have super wide feet these fit amazing! I really recommend purchasing them as they are an amazing value for the price!",

Huge range of sizing options including wide sizes. They are as good or better than running shoes I've paid twice the price for. Maybe a little too platformed for weightlifting, but that's what weightlifting shoes/converse are for.I do not use these outdoors *at all* so maybe they get torn apart by concrete. I can't say. But for working out in a studio setting, these are an incredible value.",
