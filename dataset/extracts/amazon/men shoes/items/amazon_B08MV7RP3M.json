It keeps me from bringing dirt back inside the house. I've tried using old tennis shoes but they're hard to just slip into. These are really GREAT - easy to slip into without having to tie or untie the laces. They're more comfortable than using older shoes, too. I bought my regular shoe size and they fit very well but I don't usually wear socks with them. I generally wear them to walk down to get the mail or to go outside to talk to my yard man. The couple of times I had socks on, they still fit fine but if I were going to wear the for longer periods of time, I might want to try a half size larger.",

However, I am returning them because they are too loose due to ordering the wide. I went to the Kizik website and did a chat.

                "reviewText": "I have arthritis and bending to tie shoe laces is no fun. The unique design of this shoe totally eliminates that problem. Just step into the shoe and the material at the heel buckles and lets your foot in easily, then the heel snaps back to fully enclose your foot. GREAT.This is a very comfortable shoe with lots of give so walking in it is more like walking in slippers, but with the support of a good walking shoe.The one negative that I will site is that for inexplicable reason, they put laces on a shoe that is specifically designed to be slip-on shoe that does not need laces. I have no idea why the laces are even there since all you do is slip into the shoe and out of the shoe WITHOUT needing to tie laces. Perhaps they are just for show? Then they should not be real laces that can undo themselves and straggle out for you to trip on. They should be made to LOOK like laces. These real laces are real and WAY longer than they should be so if they do come untied, you look down and you'll see you've got 6 inches of lace dangling out on either side of the shoe ready to trip you up. I took to tying a knot in the laces then cut off the extra length and hot clued the knot so it can't come undone. The whole lace thing on a slip-on shoe was a disappointment.Also questionable, if you look at most of the other models the company offers, the heal has a webbing kind of thing added to the main shoe material to help the heel of the shoe sprint back into shape. The webbing flexes when the heel of the foot step down on it as the foot enters the shoe. It then seems to helps the heel of the shoe flex back into shape after the foot is fully inserted. This particular model does not have that extra webbing attached to the back of the heel. I am wondering if the heel material on this model will eventually get crushed by the foot repeatedly going in and out of the shoe and not be able to \"bounce back\" without the spring support of at extra webbing. Time will tell.",

Unfortunately, I also need a lot more arch support. I tried them with inserts but it pushed my foot up too high and the heel slipped. So sad",

This saves me from so much struggle, love them for that.Perfect for people with limited mobility.Upsides:- I can put shoes all by myself, which outweighs the downsides.Downside:- A bit slippery while wearing inside (tile and hardwood floor).- Not water poof like vessis (I might be spoiled).- Got wide fit. Expected them to be a bit wider. However, they fit comfortably, I just thought they would be slightly wider.",

My rockstar sister in law gives these a 10/10!",
