                "reviewText": "This is a great shoe! Super comfortable daily shoes for me for the last few weeks, but there is a huge caveat: the toe boxes are low volume. The roof of the toe box is very close to the tops/knuckles of the toes. I tried my usual Saucony and NB size, 10.5, in store and did not notice the claustrophobic toe box. I ordered 10.5 on Amazon and wore them in the house but never could feel comfortable and figured they would drive me nuts! I tried 10 wide (not extra wide) and that gave my digits more breathing room, solving my problem. I made a good choice going down a half size, as I believe 10.5 wide would have been too big. The rest of the shoe does not seem to fit wide (admittedly I have not really worn wides before).Now that my toes can relax a bit I can appreciate the plush comfort of these babies. I like that the heel cups are not harsh or unforgiving, they are a little supple. I have been nursing both my Achilles tendons for a few weeks now\u2014breaking in Brooks Cascadia 16s on one hike nearly broke me!!I never notice the extended fins in back; I thought they might \u201ccatch\u201d going down carpeted stairs, but no issue.I am almost ready to get back in the mountains with these and really test them (and my heels) out. I will mos def buy more when I see a deal. Hierro V7 are my new favorites and I have tried numerous Adidas, Saucony, Merrill, North Face, and Scarpa trail runners and hikers the last few months. Robust, comfortable, and look rad.Edit: I just did about an hour in the dry Boulder Flatirons at Chautauqua Park, and I love these shoes. The wides were barely big. I kept them fairly loose due to concerns with my Achilles and needing some extra give going uphill. Tightened them a bit just before descent, as usual, but didn\u2019t wanna fiddle with them again. Can easily, comfortably lock them down a bit more next time.Comfortable on trail, very soft, you do feel big rock points and ground features underfoot, but I did not mind. These Hierros do not feel tall to me\u2014great height/stack/drop that reminds me of my fave NB trail runners from 20 years ago. (I only wonder how they will hold up given how soft they are.)Edit: I now have three pairs of Hierros. Gotta say I would love some rock plate protection underneath as I have to be careful with foot placement on particularly pointy, sharp rocks (like 10% of the time on foothills trails). I occasionally trim down the hairy, wispy fibers that work their way out of the abrasion protection of the toe box. The shoes are all pretty easy to wipe down with a washcloth after a dusty hike.The Gore-Tex fit for me just like the regular V7. I thought I\u2019d need to go up a half size like I often do for Gtx, but they were too big. Went back to 10 wide and they fit very well. You have to look at all the pix in the Amazon ad to see which are the Gtx (navy/black, crazy bright green!, and black/orange). I got the black with orange bottoms and have to say the orange is strangely close to pink\u2014not the \u201cclassic\u201d orange and black I expected. Not noticeable enough for me to exchange, though. They also have skinnier laces than the non-Gtx. The thicker laces work perfectly, but the skinny ones are a little finicky and knot up on me sometimes. GREAT shoes.",

These ones were small in the length. It fit more like a 14. The ones I have are 15W but went with 15 reg. Width is fine but your toes will jam up in the front. Giving it 5 stars for comfort, stability, and durability because my other ones are exactly that. Going to order a 16. I'll keep you posted with those ones if they have my size.",

                "reviewText": "These shoes are the first shoes that made me say \"whoa\" out loud; they're really that comfortable. Went on a week long hiking trip in the mountains, they were perfect, and I was really grateful for the grip. My only issue has been brought up in other reviews for this shoe. They do in fact start to fray early on. So they will look more beat up and used than they actually are. Under normal use, I started to notice the fraying about 5 days into my trip. I wasn't rubbing them against sharp rocks or anything, but it looks like this just happens to most of them. To solve this, I just put a lighter to them and they shrunk into the main shell of the shoe. Either way though, they really are super comfortable, and I really do recommend them.",

My husband Ordered 8.5 wide (his usual size is 8.5 to 9 but has a wide toe). These were even narrower than any other pair he has. Also the fresh foam is not at all soft and cushy. The upper fabric seemed ruff. It felt hard and non-flexible. The toe box was hurting right from the first wear. Had to return. Will recommend to try in the shop before buying.",
