The gel insert offers comfort, the orthotic support I needed is for arch and ankle containment. These shoes offers that. Love the slip in feature of this shoe your foot slides in, no more bending to get shoes on. Usually my feet are in awful pain and my walking is restricted but with these shoes I am getting so much relief. I have ordered another pair already for a family member. Price is right too.",

                "reviewText": "I've always worn a 9 1/2\" medium in every shoe (size 10 for boots) with athletic socks. My previous size 9 1/2 Skechers fit fine but I needed a shoe horn to get them on. So, I ordered the 9 1/2\" medium slip-ins. They are a true slip-on in bare feet, but I still need a shoe horn to get them on when wearing socks. Once on, they are very comfortable. I hope they stretch a bit after wearing them for a while so I can dispense with the shoe horn! If I ever reorder them I'll try a 9 1/2\" wide or a size 10.",

My foot measures 10-1/2, but with inconsistent shoe sizing, it usually takes an eleven to work for me. In this case, the eleven is ever so slightly too long, but still very satisfactory. I would suggest, if you measure 10-1/2, order a 10-1/2.",
