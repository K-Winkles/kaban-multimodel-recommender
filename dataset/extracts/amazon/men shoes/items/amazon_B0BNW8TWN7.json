                "reviewText": "As someone who regularly wears tennis shoes for work since there\u2019s a lot of walking involved I have been hesitant to purchase dressier shoes. I have liked Clarks in the past and got a good deal so I pulled the trigger on these. I have to say these are SO comfortable. Fit is perfect. The appearance is exactly what I wanted as well. I don\u2019t like the shiny appearance but don\u2019t like true nubuck either. These are the perfect compromise. Walked miles upon miles in these already and even brand new I would put them on par with my New Balance sneakers AFA comfort.",
