Five back surgeries and five pounds of metal holds his back together, with more surgeries coming and finding comfortable shoes that doesn't hurt his back has been something I've been having problems with in the 13 years we've been together.These shoes are the best he's ever worn. Perfect fit, the right amount of arch support, fantastic breathability and comfortable. They look great on him and he's now making sure to have shoes on, something he didn't do before. He likes them so much, we bought another pair for backup, it just doesn't get any better than that. I'm thrilled, he's thrilled.",

                "reviewText": "For $30 you can\u2019t expect much. Had these for a little over 2 months but I walk 18k steps a day. First month I was astonished how comfortable these were, by month two insoles were required and unfortunately as pictured they have pretty much completely deflated now. The soft cushion foam compresses over time and the grip on the bottom become nonexistent so these are actually becoming hazardous for me to wear as I slipped a few times already. They fit true to size and mine had an odd but pleasant fragrant smell that lasted for a few weeks once I opened them, something they probably sprayed from the factory to hide the chemical plastic smell you usually get from cheap shoes. I\u2019m assuming from the wide foot opening these shoes let all kinds of pebbles and debris from walking into the shoe and it can become very annoying emptying your shoes out every few hours or so would not recommend for trails or anything other than city/indoor wear. Overall would and probably will eventually purchase again, for the money these do the job.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these for work and was disappointed. I work in a high-traffic kitchen with wet floors and within 2 months, the tread (if there ever was any) has completely worn down (see picture), I am constantly slipping on even damp tile floors. They fit well (despite seeming to have received the wrong size, EU 44/US 11, I ordered US 10), seem to function OK as normal trainers, but that is not what they are advertised for and not what I bought them for. The rubber on them smells awful which deters me from preferring them in any way. These were an overall mistake, if you need slip resistant shoes, go with TredSafe or ShoesForCrews instead, Danner or Merrell if you don't mind spending more for quality.",

Right shoe was slightly tighter, when I compared the lengths, it was actually shorter in size..so that explains why my big toe was flush against the shoe. Shoe is very light weight, I like that, and comfortable for the most part minus the tightness.",

The first time, my feet were a bit hurt from friction between the shoe and the skin; in the right foot at the 'superior extensor retinaculum' and the left foot at the left 'superior peroneal retinaculum'. I must stress that this happened when the shoe is not too large or too small. The second and third time, my feet were not hurt at all, meaning that the shoe adjusted to the foot. Overall, everything is fine, so the shoe gets five stars.",
