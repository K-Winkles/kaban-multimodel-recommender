When we first received these shoes, we did not have a lot of hope for them. They are lightweight, and it seemed like they would not be durable. However, these shoes have been great. He wears them everyday, and two months later, they still look great. When they do wear out or when he outgrows them, we will be buying another pair.",

                "reviewText": "So I bought these as a trial run as I love the Adidas slip on shoes (Adidas lite racer adapt) for just casual wear and some gym shoes. I love the slip on, slip off of them but I didn\u2019t want to spend $50-$70 for different colors every few months. So here we are, I bought these, tried them for a few days and I give it a passing grade. Comfortable, stylish and great slip on, slip off. Highly recommend them. I do not like the laces but I cut them after I tied them into a knot, so that way I don\u2019t need to tie them anymore. Kinda pointless to have considering they slip on slip off and shouldn\u2019t have to be tightened, but either way not a big deal (see picture). They\u2019re not nearly as cushioned as the Adidas but for the price I wasn\u2019t expecting them to be. I highly recommend to not use them as running shoes, highly doubt they will hold up. But for gym days (without cardio) and going to and from places, they are awesome and will work. I also love the fact that there\u2019s no decals or designs, just straight up plain shoes. I\u2019ll definitely be buying more and recommend these to whoever wants a nice stylish, comfortable slip on shoe.",
