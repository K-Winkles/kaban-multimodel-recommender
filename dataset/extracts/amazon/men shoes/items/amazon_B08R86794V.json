They feel a little like crocs, so they're very comfy, and my feet never get sore standing for long. They provide a lot more support than other thinner mens loafers, so thats why I went with them even though some other leather and nubuck loafers looked nicer. Ultimately picking these for the comfort was an excellent decision, and I was pleasantly surprised with the extra pair of soles they come with! And they look nice too considering it's fabric. They have held up in light rain too and my feet haven't gotten wet. I'd recommend spraying them with a hydrophobic coating when you first get them before you wear them. All in all, 5/5, accurate size, excellent quality, excellent comfort, unbeatable price. Would def buy again",
