                "reviewText": "They are very lightweight, almost confusingly so. I'd tend to judge a shoe this light somewhat harshly just because the weight makes it feel cheap in way. However, I feel like these should hold up quite well. I have a pretty active job these days, which requires me to be up and down on ladders and furniture, and up and down stairs all day, plus inside and outside the building during all the varying weather conditions presented in our area. SO FAR, these have been the only slip resistant shoes I've owned that are actually slip resistant on day one. I have to mop several floors as part of my daily work, and every shoe before this one has slipped on those freshly mopped floors during the first couple week break-in period. These shoes did not slip, and didn't even feel like they could slip on those freshly mopped floors. Which is nice, since I'm usually walking on wet floors when dry mopping. On freshly mopped and dried floors, they seem to want to stick to the floor, which is a sort of testament to how slip resistant they are. I'm impressed by this, but time will tell with how they wear. My only negative with these has to do with the lack of arch support. If you're used to chucks, or many brands of skate shoes, you probably won't notice. They aren't uncomfortable though, just no arch support.",

I work all day each day at Chick-fil-A and before these shoes, I had very uncomfortable ones that hurt my heels and also the top of my foot where the laces were. These shoes are soft all around. I do still use insole inserts (Protalus\u2026amazing) because of how long I am on my feet and for additional comfort, but these shoes I would buy again and again. These are the ones you want. They fit me perfectly and were not too narrow. These shoes have held up extremely well too and are very stretchy to give great flexibility and room in the toes.",

Because if you don't take care of your feet, it's going to mess up your back, and if your back is messed up, you can't function.Durability is okay, but these are not meant for anything serious. Definitely not waterproof. They are also slippery and dont have much of a grip on a significant number of types of floors. And that's a safety issue.Get something better is my opinion.",

                "reviewText": "Die Schue sind genauso, wie beschrieben: leicht, atmungsaktiv (feuchte schwei\u00dfige F\u00fc\u00dfe - kein Problem), anziehen ohne schn\u00fcren zu m\u00fcssen, der Fu\u00df wird nicht eingeengt und kann sensibel \"mitf\u00fchlen\" was am Fu\u00df passiert (ich bin Fluglehrer und die F\u00fc\u00dfe m\u00fcssen sensibel sp\u00fcren, was an den Pedalen des Seitenruders passiert, ohne den Sch\u00fcler zu st\u00f6ren). Die Schuhe sind so angenehm, das ich mir ein zweites Paar f\u00fcr die Freizeit hole. Wer allerdings ARBEITSSCHUHE mit Gelenkst\u00fctze, ggf. Stahlkappen oder harter Sohle sucht ist hier falsch (ganz erstaunlich, das die schlechten Bewertungen dahingehend fast durchweg aus den USA kommen....so so so). Holen, probieren und behalten - wem es nicht gef\u00e4llt, der kann es ja zur\u00fcckschicken - oder? (Schreibe selten Rezensionen, aber der Schu hat es verdient:-).",
