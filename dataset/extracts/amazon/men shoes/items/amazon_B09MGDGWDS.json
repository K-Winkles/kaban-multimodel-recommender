                "reviewText": "From the moment I laced up these shoes and took my first steps, I could feel the exceptional performance they offer. The cushioning system provides excellent shock absorption, ensuring a comfortable and smooth ride, even during long-distance runs.

It hugs my feet snugly, providing a secure and supportive feel without any discomfort or tightness. The breathable upper material keeps my feet cool and dry, even during intense workouts. Additionally, the shoe's lightweight design adds to the overall comfort, making it a pleasure to wear for extended periods.One standout feature of the Trace 2 is its traction. The rubber outsole offers excellent grip on various surfaces, providing stability and confidence with every step. I feel secure running on both pavement and trails, which is a testament to the shoe's versatility.Durability is another area where the Brooks Trace 2 shines. Despite my regular use, the shoes have shown no signs of wear and tear. The quality construction and materials used ensure that they will last me for many miles to come.In summary, the Brooks Trace 2 running shoes are a fantastic choice for runners seeking exceptional performance, comfort, and durability.

I have a bad hip and these shoes have great support and keep me steady on my feet. So for my son who has to always wear an arch support insert in all his shoes I thought why not try them for him. I kid you not he has worn these everyday since receiving them last week. And he doesn\u2019t need his arch support insert with these. Brooke\u2019s arch support is awesome. I own about 6 pairs. Highly recommend for wherever life takes you from running to hiking to walking. They are amazing.",
