                "reviewText": "If you like shiny patent-leather dress shoes with a velvet vamp (upper foot section) and tongue (flex part in front of the ankle), these are the shoes for you. The last time I got dress shoes was 30+ years age. They were size 9 1/5. Recently, I received a wedding invitation, but the shoes no longer fit me \u2013 I normally wear slip-on casual/work loafers with anti-slip soles. My current foot size is 10 \u00bd and 11 (feet different sizes \u2013 ahem \u2013 don\u2019t ask). I am providing this size information because I was concerned about getting shoes that fit on the first try \u2013 always tried on shoes before purchase. I ordered size 12 (wide). They fit perfectly \u2013 easy to slip-on even with thick socks and fit perfectly with good toe-room. The leather is mirror shiny \u2013 the velvet luxurious (dark blue \u2013 almost black) \u2013 the insole/arch is properly curved for foot comfort \u2013 the sole is slightly textured. Because of the velvet, they are not water resistant. The shoes are exactly as advertised \u2013 with a caution on size. I\u2019m glad I ordered one size larger than my usual size.Experience: These shoes have TPR ( which stands for Thermo Plastic Rubber) soles, which add to comfort, traction and durability, however, I found the vinyl kitchen floor slippery when wearing them for the first time. So, I wore them all day, out and about shopping, etc., and by the end of the day, better traction. There was no \u201cnew shoe\u201d discomfort and there was no issue with \u201cloose heel\u201d due to them being slip-ons instead of secured by shoestrings.",

They remind me of the shine on the shoes worn by the guards at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The size is right, and the shoes are comfortable. The back doesn't come up so high that it rubs on my Achilles like many of my other dress shoes. Longevity and durability are yet to be seen, but for $35, it's a great deal for a great looking shoe.",
