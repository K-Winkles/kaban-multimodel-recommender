        "description": "Reebok is an American-inspired global brand with a deep fitness heritage and a clear mission: To be the best fitness brand in the world. Not an easy one. But if there is one brand that can make it happen, it is Reebok, the brand that was fundamentally part of a fitness movement that forever changed the way we look at spandex and headbands. Sure, this is not the 1980s anymore \u2013 the world has moved on. But so has Reebok and it continues to be daring. Daring is knowing greatness doesn\u2019t come from sameness. The past years have been characterized by a transformation from traditional sports to fitness. The three sides of the Reebok Delta, a symbol of change and transformation, represent the physical, mental and social changes that occur when individuals embrace the challenge of bettering themselves in the gym, in their lives and in the world. Reebok was founded for one of the best reasons possible: athletes wanted to run faster. So in the 1890s, Joseph William Foster made some of the first known running shoes with spikes in them. By 1895, he was in business making shoes by hand for top runners; and before long his fledgling company, J.W. Foster and Sons, developed an international clientele of distinguished athletes.",

                "reviewText": "Ok i ordered size 9. I went up a size and had to return because ive always worn the classic gum bottoms and they run narrow but the Harman's run sneaker is what i needed because they are more of a M/Wide they look great but were way too large! Second pair i recived in my normal 8.5 had the supposed Ortholite insole was white not blue and thats what i was expecting to get bk when i reordered but they are not by any means supportive! When you go to the shoe store i have always got the actual comfort insole and this deff. is NOT IT! But over all Rebock has always been my #1 all time favorite and they look great and dont feel great as far as the insole. Id suggest if your more than 130/150lbs and want comfort and support because your wearing for that reason or just on your feet for many hours just go buy at the actual store but if you are a shoe junkkie and just wear here and there and dont care for insoles w/comfort and want to save 20$ then go for it! I cant speak for longevity since i just recived them. Go with you reg. Size in this shoe because it runs wide and you will have plenty room left with these Harman's. If your purchasing the classic gums then depending on the width you need you may want to go up a half size. Hope this helps anyone out there struggling with what size they should buy because i know i shure did and thats why i went with the Harmin's because i need a M/W and they look GREAT! And this Co. Was very swift with my exchange i requested exchange and had them 2days later still have to return the 1st pair come tomm. and im happy as long as they last.. i still have my classic gums from high school and their still kicking and have never fallen apart over many years of daily wear! I added in the pic. The sticker proving they are synthetic not real leather as claimed! I've seen sooo many ppl saying these were real and never took the time to actually look! I am highly upset about that and its where they just snap on the fake orthopedic foot for your. That little blue foot feels more orthopedic than my insole lol... again i hope this helps anyone!",
