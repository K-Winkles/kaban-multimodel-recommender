                "reviewText": "This boots are light weight, and fit as expected. I have wide feet, I often have to size up to get shoes that fit. I got these in 11.5 wide. They fit my foot exactly, and because my foot is not crammed up in the toe box, my feet stay a little cooler. It is important to have the boots laced properly, or your foot can slide a little.I find the footing to be solid, even on sandy south FL soil. I hiked some river trails with my child and his scout troop. I had very solid footing, and I was even able to help others, and confidently traverse everything I came across. it is a fairly powerful feeling to be that confident in your footing. I am used to sneakers, so this was a huge upgrade to me.I found these boots comfortable, but with a caveat. These are not crocks or Uggs comfortable. They don't offer a squishy soft ride. These are utility comfortable. They are form fitting to my arch, and they are designed, first and foremost for traction. If you need soft, these are not the droids you're looking for.I really appreciate the breathability, fit, traction, comfort, and over all aesthetic. These are 5 star in my book. I will probably even wear them in settings where all the features are not needed.",

                "reviewText": "These boots are great for a casual hike. I'm not qualified to comment on how they would hold up on mountaineering or very long hikes, but for most people they are a great buy. I got these at a great price and I am very happy with them.Even with the padding, I would recommend using wool socks like \"Fits\" brand or \"Smartwool\" - something with at least 70% merino wool. Even in the summer you can wear them because they wick sweat away and are antimicrobial so they won't stink. Definitely a good idea if you are wearing boots for the first time or for a longer hike.Pros:- Surprisingly light weight yet also sturdy- Very comfortable and generous padding on the inside - comfortable even on first wear for 5 mile hike with hills- The grip seems to be quite good. I didn't slip even on muddy and wet rocks while others around me did.- They do seem to be waterproof up to a few inches of puddles. I didn't test them totally submerged up to the top of the boot though.Cons:- They aren't the most fashionable boots, but that makes it easier to get them muddy and not care too much.",
