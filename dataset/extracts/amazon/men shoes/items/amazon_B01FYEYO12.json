                "reviewText": "Okay you asked for it...I'm very surprised that this shoe fit better than expected. I tried on some shoes at a department store, to find a good size, usually 10 -11, but some 11's fit & then some 10.5's fit. Some shoes are too long (stick out like clown shoes) when trying to get a good fit at the bridge or also the widest part of the foot. I took a chance on the 10.5's to order, as shoes are one thing I would never order on-line, but at this price I would take that chance and am really impressed (so far).This shoe fit just right at the widest part of the foot, and when laced up, the bridge (top) of foot is not tight, doesn't hurt and feels very comfortable.They look good, look like good construction, and are comfortable from the start (don't feel like new shoes).The only thing that is noticeable in walking, is that the sole, I believe is synthetic (?) and may be a little slick on some surfaces, then again, they don't \"stick\" like rubber soles, maybe after wearing for a while this will change or I'll get used to it.I really like them so far, but only time will tell, I guess. Hope this helps.",

They were not offered in a wide width but they matched great with an old 70s leather jacket I got from my father so I figured I would give them a shot because Amazon has such a great return policy. When I got them and opened I was very impressed with the look and quality of them and was praying they fit good because I liked them so much. They go on like most typical dress shoes. They were tight going on but very comfortable once on. I could not believe how great they fit because they look narrow but fit my feet very well. The first night I wore them I was in them standing and an engagement party for 4 hours. Never did my feet get sore or feel uncomfortable as the night went on. I'm hoping they hold up well. I would definitely reccomend them I'm glad I bought them I was skeptical because they weren't offered in a wide width and they turned out great.",

But i liked them enough to buy them again since i thought they lasted well and i liked them. However this new pair does not compare to the old pair. They are more narrow, insole seems like it will slip and cause that little crease while wearing them that annoys you since you can feal it through your socks. Oh and if you wear thicker socks, i would think you would think they are way to tight. I think ive had 4 pairs from this brand and liked them, they were cheaper and lasted me 4 years.",
