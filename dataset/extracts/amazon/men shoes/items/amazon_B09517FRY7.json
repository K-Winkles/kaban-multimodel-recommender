Can't attest to high impact work outs, but they work great for lots of walking in varied city conditions.The only complaint was I had to size up a half size from my previous model of Cohesion 12s. The previous pair had all be size 12 US. Had to exchange for a size 12.5",

                "reviewText": "Distance running has been my go-to exercise for most of my adult life - 30+ years. I've exclusively worn Saucony running shoes since about the first year, so I have plenty of experience with their shoes. They make a wide range of running shoes with a wide price range to match. They aren't as well-known as Nike or Adidas, but they really live up to their slogan of being \"true to the sport\".I normally buy their mid-price runners. At ~25 miles per week, they last about 5 - 6 months and give good support on pavement, side roads or treadmills. I happened to spot these on sale this time and was excited to get a great deal on what looked to be a newer version of their Cohesion shoes.Long story short, these are definitely not Saucony's best shoes. They feel too light, like cheap shoes you'd find at Wal Mart. They also don't have the support I normally find with Saucony. They feel more spongey - like they won't stand up to distance-running.Only time will tell. I'm going to use them on my treadmill for now, but I definitely won't buy these again. Don't read this to mean I'm abandoning Saucony altogether - I'll just stick with the ones that I know are great.",
