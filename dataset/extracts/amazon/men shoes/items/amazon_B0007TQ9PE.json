                "reviewText": "I purchased these polished full-grain leather shoes on March 20, 2017, seeking a professional yet affordable option for everyday wear. They have exceeded my expectations in both style and comfort.The polished leather uppers give the shoes a sleek, professional look, suitable for various settings. This was important to me, as I wanted shoes that looked good but were more practical for daily use compared to my special occasion Allen Edmonds.Comfort is a standout feature, thanks to the padded collars. They add an extra layer of cushioning, making the shoes comfortable for all-day wear. This has been particularly beneficial for long workdays or when I'm on my feet for extended periods.The shoes' flexible construction contributes to their overall comfort, allowing for natural foot movement. Additionally, their acceptance by the American Podiatric Medical Association highlights their quality and effectiveness in promoting good foot health.The durable, siped rubber outsole is another key aspect, offering excellent traction on wet surfaces, which adds to their practicality for everyday use.In summary, these shoes are a perfect blend of professional style, comfort, and practicality, making them an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable everyday shoe.",

                "reviewText": "I believe I've ordered this shoe four times over the past decade. It's a solid shoe that has had very little changes to quality, except for this time. My previous shoes lasted about 2 to 3 years while wearing them a few times a week. The main point of failure after a couple years would be the sole would crack from bending. I would consider them a success.This last order, my shoe is already losing the trim that lies underneath the laces, mainly right below the knot. I only had worn the shoes a few times with nothing more than walking and driving. This trim, which is wearing away quite rapidly due to the laces rubbing is unsatisfactory, and is a bad sign that the process or the material has changed.Other than that, the shoe has been a pretty good shoe with OK comfort. I would buy again if I learned that they fixed the problem, because it's a great deal if the quality is restored.",
