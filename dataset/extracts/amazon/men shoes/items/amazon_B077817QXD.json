I knew he would be on his feet for his job at a fast food restaurant so he needed comfort and slip resistance.He was surprised at how comfortable they are and says they work well for the slip resistance too. His only complaint is that they are ugly but that's par for the course for a black work shoe. The quality is good and the price was great too!",

                "reviewText": "They fit great, offer tremendous ankle/heel support, excellent non-skid outsole and durable outer materials.The only issue with this particular pair was a rather loud, persistent squeak with every step taken on both shoes. After further investigation it was discovered that the material on the tongue would squeak when it rubbed against the laces and surrounding material. The fix was rubbing some light oil into the outer surface of the tongue...6 weeks later and no squeaks, problem solved. Hope that tip helps others who may have similar issues.",

                "reviewText": "So as shoes go, these fit well, and look really good. Neutral, not too many fancy lines and curves. I would say a sound basic shoe. Cushioning is ample, would be good for being on your feet all day if necessary. There is a drawback though, these shoes make a squeaky rubbing noise. The tongue is made of leather, and as you walk, both shoes make a rubbing squeaky sound. I have tightened the laces down as far as I can and still be comfy, and they still squeak a little with each step take. This could be irritating to some people!",

Anyways, I can not take it back because I wore them for a long. Of course, I took both soles off. They were super glued and very hard to take them off! UGH! Finally, I replacement a different sole pad. It was still pinch. I was not happy. I should have to wear them inside at home if any problem , bother or whatsoever. I CAN take them back and replacement them. It was too late. Maybe maybe maybe, I will buy it again if if, I feel it like pinch or not. Watch my fingers. Hope.",

The non slip hasn't worn out either. I walk to work in them and to the grocery store, etc. I've had them about 6 months of regular use and they are holding up, sole hasn't come off. I think I bought some gel inserts though. I guess I forgot about that. I would definitely buy gel inserts if you can.",
