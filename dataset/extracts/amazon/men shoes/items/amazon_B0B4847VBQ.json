                "reviewText": "I have wide feet with a high instep. Regular shoes are either tight on me or do not fit right, but the X-Wide size that ASICS offers is a godsend, and I just love the comfort and performance running shoe; It fits me perfectly and the variety of different colors make each purchase even better. My current purchase was a Black with White and hot Lime Green trim Gel Venture 9 running shoe. Sometimes I buy two different color pairs for different days and events/venues. I walk routinely every day if I can, but I simply use it for everything: at work, grocery shopping, exercise, casual\u2026 it\u2019s starting to become my everything footwear (except for sleep). I recall the first time I came across an X-Wide Gel Venture 5 years ago at Ross Dress For Less, and found it so good I repurchased the shoe on Amazon because Ross gets their selection at random or not at all. At Amazon you get to what you order and these always fit right (for whatever reason) so I never needed to do a return (yet). Come to think of it, I have only purchased and worn ASICS Gel Venture iterations for the past several years (thank you Amazon). In conclusion, for this particular shoe model and brand, the extra wide options are accommodating in size and shape and fits me well. The ASICS Gel-Venture 9 shoes are the best at performance and comfort for the price point offered and I plan to continue to purchase the next numbers in the line for years to come. May this shoe line be long lived (because I would like to continue to have good shoes at a fair price).",

I\u2019ve had to wear 12 1/2 and 11 1/2 before even though my shoe size always measures 12 in the US. Both pair have been spotted on at 12s. Both pairs had to be broken in for a few days but definitely not more than 10 hours of time.
