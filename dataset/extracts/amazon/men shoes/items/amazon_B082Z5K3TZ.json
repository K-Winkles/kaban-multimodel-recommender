They look cook in the pictures, and they look cook in person. Beyond that, this is truly a case of \"you get what you pay for\"...The shoes fit fine and in terms of comfort, they're probably best described as: \"meh...\" They're fine to walk in. You won't find them uncomfortable, but you won't necessarily find them comfortable either.The material making up the heel area of the shoes is more of a stretchy fabric than a solid construction, so it has some flex to it. This made my feet feel like they were going to walk right out of the shoes at times.I work out a decent amount as well, and I would advise you that you CANNOT run in these. There's just no support for running. They're perfectly fine for just walking around and as a day-shoe though.In summary; they still look cool and they're OK to wear. Just be warned that the construction of the shoes won't meet your expectations... You get what you pay for...",
