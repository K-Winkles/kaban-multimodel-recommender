                "reviewText": "These are a tad heavy and clunky to me, so I probably wouldn't ever wear them to run. I just really liked the way that looked, so I bought two different colors of this style, and will definitely keep both pairs. I actually bought seven total pairs of new running shoes at the same time (Nike, Adidas, and Puma) and weighed them all, and these are the heaviest out of all of them, but it doesn't bother me because I bought them as casual shoes to wear with jeans, etc. I have very narrow feet with extremely high arches, and I typically like my shoes to fit pretty tightly. These are very snug, which I like, but a lot of people might not. The soles are very cushioned and almost feel a little too soft, which most people will probably love, but they make me feel a little goofy, like I'm walking on shoes with rounded soles. The lacing is a little weird because the lace loops are near the soles, rather than the top of the shoes, like 99.9% of other shoes have, so they're kind of awkward to lace up to the right preference, too. However, for this price, I'm extremely happy with them, overall.",

Considering the price, I decided to take a chance on these, since wide wasn't available in my size. Due to the cushy inlay, I didn't feel the usual pain in the arch of my foot when I wear a thinner shoe. Excellent quality, and great price.",
