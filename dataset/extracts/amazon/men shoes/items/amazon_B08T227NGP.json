                "reviewText": "I bought my first pair in January 2019 and wore them every single day for 4 years, through all of the elements. They would've lasted longer if I didn't have such an active job, the sole started coming off the right one, so I ordered a new pair because of how long they lasted me. I ordered this pair in October, and the shipping was expected to be in January but I received them way ahead of schedule in November, so I'm very impressed with the speed they came to me.They're very comfortable after breaking them in. I like to just keep the laces tied so I can just slip them on and go.Honestly, I will keep buying these shoes every time I wear mine out, I have been burned by expensive/name brand shoes that are double or triple the price and lasted me the same amount of time. Skip them, and just buy these!",

                "reviewText": "I give 7/10 for these sneakers. Mainly because it is January and both shoes now have busted seems where the shoe meets base. 3 months of daily use is all they lasted. I have gotten 1+ years from cheaper ones.For those 3 months they were comfortable, lightweight and didn't hurt my feet. I have 2 pinched psyatic nerves that creates a lot of pain with low cost shoes but I was comfortable in these that is the only reason for the 3 stars otherwise it'd be 2 because a shoe regardless of cost should last at least 6 months. I would recommend if u spend 8+ hours a day on your feet that you try a better shoe",

                "reviewText": "First of bought a size larger than I would normally buy, based on other reviews. The shoes themselves were nice and seemed well made for the price. Also, liked the padded and removable inner sole.However, the fit needs to be improved.The heel and rear portion of the shoe was good. But the mid and toe area of the shoe were very tight. Even with the laces loose, the tounge area was tight. My toes felt like they were on top of one another.I don't have wide feet, but these are not well thought it for US men's feet. If you small and thin, they may work. Would not recommend.",
