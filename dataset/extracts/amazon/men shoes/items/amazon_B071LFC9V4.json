It is well made with leather uppers and had a great traction sole for the winter months. I ordered a wide to allow for thicker socks in the winter and it still fits perfectly!",

I generally have some trouble with shoes fitting badly or generally causing foot discomfort, and I was worried these might be the same since I hadn\u2019t tried Dockers before. I was pleasantly surprised - they were comfortable from the beginning. The leather seems to be of good quality; it doesn\u2019t have a \u2018plasticky\u2019 feel like many low quality leather products do.I did get a wide, since some reviews mentioned the shoes felt narrow, and this turned out to be a good decision.I have cleaned the shoes a couple times with saddle soap that includes a leather conditioner. They look nice every time afterwards, and the leather feels a bit softer now than when they first arrived.Overall, I'm very impressed by the quality and comfort of these shoes, and it\u2019s a great value for the price.",

I initially ordered 11's of these shoes, and my toes were right up the tip, the sides were still uncomfortably tight up against my foot, and the top of the shoe was pressed up against the top of my foot (cutting off circulation). So I ordered 11.5's. Slightly better on point 1, but the sides were even narrower, and still pressed up against the top of my foot (mind you, this is with the laces being completely loose and not tied at all.I currently wear and loved other Dockers shoes every day and love them. They're properly Wide and roomy, and are very comfortable. It's just these shoes. I really wanted to love them with how great they LOOK, but they are utterly mislabeled in size and width. Fix it, or just stop selling them.",
