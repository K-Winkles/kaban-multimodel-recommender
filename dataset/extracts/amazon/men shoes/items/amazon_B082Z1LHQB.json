                "reviewText": "So I hope this story tells the tale: I came in from working in the yard and notice my Merrill Encore Bypass Clogs (NOT Bypass 2) had a sole coming undone. I remarked to a family member how much I loved the shoe but if they were made this cheaply, I wouldn't buy a replacement. The family member explained to me that I had owned those shoes for so long, and put them through so much, they were surprised they were even in one piece. Disbelieving, I consulted Amazon to see when I made the original purchase. It had been FIVE PLUS YEARS AGO. My main yardwork, dirty grimy shoe had somehow lasted 5 years. I've had steel toe work boots fall apart in half the time easily. I went on Amazon and noticed that Bypass 1 was now Bypass 2. I bought a pair and was happy to find out they were basically the same. I have purchased several more as backups and hope they continue making them forever.They are comfortable. They have a solid sole so stepping on thorns and such is a non-issue. They go on and off hands free when really messy. They can be cleaned easily with a garden hose. Finally, my clogs live by the mud room and serve a specific high stress and messy purpose. I cannot speak to them as a full-time shoe. I suspect they would perform admirably though.Finally - if you are in between sizes, go with the smaller size. The lean slightly small. Slightly.",

The foot opening has no stretch or give at all, and it also seemed too small. I re-ordered the shoes 1/2 size larger which I have never had to do before, and now they feel and fit well. I prefer these to my previous Merrell jungle mocs due to increased breathability, overall comfort, and ease of slipping my feet in.",
