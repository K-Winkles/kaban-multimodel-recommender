At the same time, the new tooling combines an EVA midsole foam with GEL technology cushioning in the forefoot to increase shock absorption. Additionally, the improved outsole offers better flexibility and a more durable design.",

But as I started playing more aggressively my shoes have been sliding on the court. This made me invest in the court shoes and glad I chose these shoes. For the price I paid, these shoes have a great design and the fit is amazing. As I mentioned I needed a good pair of shoes that can withstand the slides on the court I was having and these shoes \ud83d\udc5f worked great for me.Another good thing about the shoes is that they are super lightweight and comfortable. I absolutely recommend these shoes for anyone who is planning to use them on hard courts.Sports I played with this shoes : Pickle ball and Tennis.",
