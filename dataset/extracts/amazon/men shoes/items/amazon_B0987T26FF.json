                "reviewText": "I recently embarked on a quest to find the perfect running shoe, and after trying various brands and models, I can confidently say that the Saucony Men's Ride has exceeded all expectations. In fact, I'm so impressed that I've just ordered my second pair, and I can't wait to share my experience with fellow runners.To give you a bit of context, I weigh around 185 pounds, size 12W, and my typical road runs cover approximately 100 miles each month. I've tried both the Ride and Triumph models in the past, and while they've served me well, the latest iteration of the Ride has truly raised the bar.Comfort Beyond Compare:The first thing that struck me about the Saucony Men's Ride is the unparalleled comfort it offers. The shoe seems to mold to my feet, providing a snug yet not restrictive fit. The cushioning is just right \u2013 not too soft that it feels like running on clouds, but not too firm that it compromises on comfort during longer runs. It strikes the perfect balance, making each stride feel effortless.Durability That Endures:As a runner who logs significant miles, durability is a crucial factor for me. The Saucony Men's Ride has proven its mettle on the roads, holding up exceptionally well even after reaching the 600-mile mark. The construction of the shoe, from the outsole to the upper, seems designed to withstand the rigors of regular road running. It's reassuring to invest in a pair of shoes that not only perform superbly but also stand the test of time.Consistency Across Miles:One of the standout features for me is the consistent performance throughout the lifespan of the shoe. Unlike some other models that may lose their cushioning or responsiveness over time, the Saucony Men's Ride maintains its high level of performance, mile after mile. This consistency has made it my go-to choice for both short sprints and long-distance runs.Conclusion:In conclusion, if you're in the market for a reliable, comfortable, and durable running shoe, the Saucony Men's Ride is a game-changer. It has become my trusted companion on the roads, supporting me through every stride and mile. I highly recommend it to fellow runners who value both performance and longevity in their running gear. I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of my second pair, confident that the Saucony Men's Ride will continue to be the best companion for my running journeys.",

                "reviewText": "I was not sure what to expect from this redesign of the Saucony Ride. I have run in the 10, 12 (iso 2), and 13 and they basic did not change that much, knew what I was getting and what the ride would be like. With the 15, it was a complete redesign. New upper, more cushioning (stack height), and lighter.The stack height is the similar to the Saucony Triumph 18, (their plush max cushion shoe), and the professional reviewers were saying this shoe has a softer midsole than previous versions. This lead me to believe that I would have something like a soft max cushion ride.When I unboxed and put these bad boys and laced them up I was feeling like oh no! They are really firm and the forefoot felt almost harsh. But the longer I had them on the more comfortable they felt. I love the fit of the upper. For me Saucony has always had the fit dialed in just right.My first run in these shoes was solid! Ran slow at first then picked up the pace. These shoes definitely feel better when I'm running in them! Slower pace was fine but picking up the pace was where I really felt the shoe exceled, for a daily trainer. Smooth transition and a bit of a pop on toe off. I think this is the best version yet.While running the firmness was not noticeable. There appears to be short break in period after a couple of runs these shoes feel really good. I also run in the Triumph and Kinvara's but I find myself reaching for this pair of shoes more often than not.Because of the increased stack height you will not get the road feel like in previous versions. If you like the feel of the road this might not be the shoe for you. I don't know if they are softer than prior versions but after a few miles they are feeling really comfortable. I would definitely buy these again.",

New Balance until they got hard.Switched to Triumphs for a few years but the new ones (19/20) felt just plain wrong.Tried Brooks Ghosts 14 and Asics 24 and they were far too soft (made my heels sore on the sides so I guess they were somehow stretching ligaments).Tried the new Asics Nimbus 24 and they were too soft and too bulky.The Saucony Ride 15 are just soft enough but supportive. They recover just right for slower runs when my legs feel stiff or my feet are sore.My alternate running shoe is the Kinvara 13. When my legs feel younger I put on the Kinvara's and it's like I'm an elf gliding along the road. Great shoe too with little bulk.",
