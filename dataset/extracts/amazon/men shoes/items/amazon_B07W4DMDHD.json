Came across these and they offered wide enough slippers for 13-14 size shoe and fits absolutely perfect! He loves them and says they\u2019re more durable, comfortable, and don\u2019t need to break them in just like his old pair we got from Costco. We also did the try before you buy option and definitely going to start utilizing that feature more often!",

I bought these too big to be sure that he could get his feet in them and these are roomy like flip flops. It's my fault that they're big, but like I said, I wanted to make sure they fit him. He has 13 wide feet and we can never just find shoes off the rack that fit. These are perfect if you have large wide feet. They have the tread on the bottom and they are cushiony soft inside. They're surprisingly light weight for their size and material. Most importantly, my husband loves them. He wears them all the time while he's home. 10/10 Would recommend!",
