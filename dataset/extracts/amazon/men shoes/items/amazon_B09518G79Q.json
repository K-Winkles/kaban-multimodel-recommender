Good lockdown, cushioning is good, but not overkill, ala Skechers.I love rocker in the soles. They feel as though they will live up to the hype. Price was FIFTY DOLLARS less than Shoe Station, and I got them Three Days Early!! These guys definitely have my business. Will update the shoes as I get some time on them. UPDATE: have been running in them several days a week. These are THE BEST running shoes I have ever worn. Plenty of cushioning without being overly soft. Really good rocker that \u201cpushes you off\u201d and results in quicker laps. The Best Buy for the money reviews are spot on. Get yours NOW!!",

                "reviewText": "Have used various Saucony shoes for years for short-distance, track workouts, and marathon training and marathons. Had never heard of these until I saw positive reviews on a few running shoe review websites, so I bought these (version 2) at a discount on a whim to see if they lived up to the hype. Yes, they do. While I would not race in them (probably going with Endorphin Pro 3 next event), they are indeed a solid training shoe. In fact, they got me out the door and allowed me to complete a long run during a week when I had a little flare of PF in the ball of one foot. The high, curved/rolling toe and firm, snappy toe-off provided enough help with transition that the PF was not an issue on a hilly training course. They naturally propel you forward, so I was not overworking my PF. And to my surprise, they do quite well on hills. I was worried about the low 4mm drop on my calves and Achilles since I usually run in shoes that have about an 8mm drop, so I took out the factory insert and replaced it with a SuperFeet insert that has a little more lift and a touch of medial support. Maybe not necessary because they're fairly stable shoes for a neutral shoe, but for peace of mind and prevention. I felt good at the end of the run, no issues, no additional irritation to my PF. Even my quads felt a little less beat up than usual. They're in my rotation now. Solid shoe, two thumbs-up.",
