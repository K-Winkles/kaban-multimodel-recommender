                "reviewText": "Due to multiple ankle sprains from prior basketball and volleyball competitions, I always wore high top basketball shoes to play pickleball. I finally decided it was time to see if my ankles would hold up okay wearing low top shoes, and these are just the ticket. I've been wearing them for competitive pickleball play for several months with no problem. They provide good support, good grip on the court (even when it's a little damp), and are wearing well. I'll buy another pair when it's time to replace these.",

                "reviewText": "I got the black pair because they were $10-$30 cheaper than the white ones\u2026 and I\u2019m too old to be making fashion statements on the pickleball court, and $50 is a great deal for a good court shoe.Pros: Construction seems good and lateral stability and grip are good. Width isn\u2019t noticeably wide but not narrow like the Assics I\u2019ve tried.Cons; size runs a little short. I fit a size 11 on all shoes but these come a little closer to my toes than normal. The \u201cbreathable mesh\u201d above the toe area is solid fabric not very breathable. The foam insert is glued in and not much for cushioning and arch support. Wish I could slip in my own inserts but because the shoe runs a little small swapping out the inserts might make the shoes too tight.My shoes last about 60 - 100 pickleball sessions before the sole tread is worn smooth. Hope these last\u2014\u2014 keep you posted.",

The outside and top side of the shoe is way more durable than the other N brands.My son kicks his feet together and it\u2019s created holes within a couple matches on other brands (N company\u2019s) but these are still going strongI\u2019m taking out 1 star due to the poor insole insert. It lasted about 4-5 matches and 1 week of practice. The insole basically is so thin and weak it is useless and needs replacement insoles.Now for the price and top/outsole durability I\u2019ll still keep buying these shoes. Just wished the insole was a little more durable.",
