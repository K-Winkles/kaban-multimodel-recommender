                "reviewText": "I purchased this shoe as well as a pair of the Skecher Afterburn M tennis shoes. I wanted a dedicated work shoe, because I was going though my shoes pretty quickly from wearing the same pair all the time. So, being that I had already had two previous pairs of the \u201cAfterburn\u201d shoe, and burned through each of them in just over a year respectively, I decided to get another pair of them and also get a pair of the Cessnock Food Service Shoe strictly for work. Both pairs of shoes arrived yesterday, and today I wore the Food Service shoe (FSS) to work for the first time.I slipped them on and found them to be a perfect fit. They are very light weight and comfortable. Usually, I find new shoes need a few days of wear to break-in until they really conform to the shape of your foot and then begin to fit well, but that wasn\u2019t the case with these FSS shoes; they fit perfectly the moment I put them on.I wore them all day at work and discovered something that really surprised me. We had a snowstorm today and got about 2\u201d by the time I got to work, and had a good 7\u201d by the end of my shift. I park outside so of course I have to brush the snow off the car. After doing so I knocked the snow off my shoes before getting into the car. I was surprised to see that the snow didn\u2019t stick to the material on top of the shoes, it was as if there was a water repellant in/on the material. I was sort of wondering why my feet weren\u2019t getting cold while I was cleaning off my car and I guess that explains it. Another surprise was the fact that these shoes make no sound when walking on a tile floor while having wet soles. The \u201cAfterburn\u201d tennis shoes squeak like a rusty hinge when the bottom of the shoe is wet and you walk across tile or other such surfaces, but the FSS\u2019s, are quiet as a mouse, not a sound comes from them, you could almost call them Ninja shoes.As for the style, well that\u2019s a personal preference and these shoes suit me just fine. I think they look sharp, and nobody even noticed I had a new pair of shoes on today.Durability is the unanswered question and being that I\u2019ve only worn them one day, that question will remain unanswered for a while. If I can get a solid two years out of them, just wearing them to work, I will definitely buy them again and certainly would recommend them to a friend.I hope this review helps with your decision. Peace.",

They were the best shoes I've ever had. Bought these put of necessity and while the shoes hurt to wear the first couple pf days, these took far less time than the last pair I owned and are even better.I have extremely wide feet at the toes due to growing up \"toe-walking\" with a very narrow heel, so on the rare occasion I can find shoes that fit my width even a little, my heel comes put when I walk. My feet would also rip them apart within months. The slightly stretchy material of these shoes accommodate my wide toes but keep my heels in place. My last pair didn't suffer any damage due to my feet and only due to normal wear and tear.I even bought a size 11 (no wide) and it fits my weird feet fantastically. If you have a similar issue with your feet, give them a try!",

                "reviewText": "I bartend at the theme parks in Orlando and average 10 miles plus a day, 6 days a week. I have burned through three different pairs of shoes in the past three months, until I found these! The conditions I am in are high volume wet conditions, and my feet stay perfectly dry in these shoes. The soles have the perfect height to keep the shoe dry, without being bulky preventing one from tripping over their own feet.I have a wide flat foot, and these shoes have PLENTY of room in them. I wear a 12W and order the same in these. When I first put them on, they feel really loose which caused concern, but after wearing them a few days, I actually like the feel of the \u201clooseness\u201d as there are ZERO pressure points on my feet with these shoes, and they are snug enough that blisters do not form. The toe box feels longer than a 12, but like I just stated, my feet do not slide in the shoes and no blisters form. I AM IN LOVE WITH THESE WORK SHOESThe shoes actually look great as well. I find myself throwing them on when heading out for casual fun too. I NEVER leave reviews, but decided to in hopes others may see this and helps them buy these shoes for the same relief. Stay comfortable my friends",
