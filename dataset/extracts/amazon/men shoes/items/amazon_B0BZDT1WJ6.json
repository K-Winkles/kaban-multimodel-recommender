                "reviewText": "These shoes are actually really good I honestly didn\u2019t expect anything bad since it\u2019s ASICS. The grip is very good you won\u2019t slip when running around the court. I had a game the day after the shoes came in and honestly I felt better on the court. The shoes I had previously were very uncomfortable I had formed 3 blisters and so I got these shoes quiet urgently. These shoes were so soft before the blister on my toe was very hard to play with I had lost games very bad but when I got these shoes it was like I was flying. I don\u2019t mean to be sarcastic but these shoes are honestly so good I was running around fast and stayed on the ground without slipping. My serves also were better idk if it had to do with the shoes or if I was just good with aim that day but my serves were on fire. The quality is top notch it very breathable, soft, and comfortable. It gives you all the flexibility you need to move how u want but tight enough to not having you slipping around. I\u2019d say it was very worth my money the design is cute and it\u2019s very good. I got many compliments on the shoes honestly even if u don\u2019t need them for tennis they would be good everyday shoes cause their so adorable. The color ateeee. I liked the neutral grey and white it just goes so well together. Sometime people manage to make grey ugly but ASICS didn\u2019t cus they ate up this color match. I love the grey contrast with the white. The fit was very good. It is true to size. Although I do want to say one thing, my normal shoes size for example Nike I am a 5 but even with that my shoes slip off a bit, for the ASICS I got a size 6 so I do recommend that you size up 1 or 2 times your usual. SUPER LIGHT WEIGHT. This is what I love about it. I put em on and it\u2019s like I\u2019m bare foot cause they are so light. That\u2019s one of my favorite things. I like my rackets light and I like my shoes light it just helps me out so much. I personally thinks it holds you down better without slowing you down either for those low shots. The only thing I can really complain about is sometimes the shoes causes discomfort down the middle of my upper foot. Maybe I got a size to small but usually I adjust it a little but and it\u2019s soft again usually it goes back to the stabbing pain. But it\u2019s kind of weird because it only happens sometimes when I wear them. Like my last game I had while on the bus I had to untie and let it go for a bit but today during practice nothing was wrong so idk maybe I\u2019m weird. Another thing is that sometime my knots don\u2019t stay and so I have to re tie then every once and a while usually u do it tighter but if I do try that it gets too tight. N e ways that\u2019s all 9.7/10 would recommend",

                "reviewText": "The inside of the shoe is not constructed to the standards of ASICS. It appears the cushion (foot) pad is just hand cut with scissors and not formed for the particular shoe. It is a tough piece of thin, thin shoe insert with no arch and side supports; otherwise, similar to the quality of ASICS Women's tennis/pickelball shoes. Disappointed. And a 1/4 to 1/2 size smaller in length and felt a 1/8 to 1/4 inch smaller in width. It could be difference between shoes broken in and those that are not. The new shoes are going back for a quality ASICS shoe, or a different shoes. It just look like ASICS ran out of the inserts and improvished and hand cut from inexpensive material and stuck them into these shoes. Too bad.",

                "reviewText": "I tried these on in a store but my size was not available...I am normally a 9.5 in sneakers and either a 9 or 9.5 in regular shoes. I tried the 9 which was too short and the 10 which was big. The price in the store was $80 and here on Amazon $64. I knew they would be comfortable. I have a narrow foot so these were perfect in the toe and all over. I have a long big toe on both feet and the extra half size is more comfortable. I like the padded heel. I also have a bunion on one foot and there is plenty of room for me and the bunion. I like the way the front narrows down a bit and doesn't look too clunky on my big feet. I love the style...so pretty. These may not be as comfortable for someone with a wider foot. I also don't wear socks with any sneakers and was bouncing around the house and outside with these and absolutely love them. I got the pink and white...really really feminine.I retired a pair of old Asics a couple of years ago that I wore for so many years that most of the sole had worn down to almost no treads..those were my walking sneakers. I would come back to this brand again.",
