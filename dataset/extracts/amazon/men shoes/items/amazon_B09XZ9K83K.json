                "reviewText": "I sent away for a pair of Karhu ikonis. I really liked them. They were soft but supportive. They looked cool. But\u2026. They were a bit narrow, and the arch support hit in front of my arch.I sent them back for these, and it\u2019s really worked out. The shoe fits my foot right. Its also soft yet supportive. Plus! These have a noticeable bounce or rebound, which feels pretty awesome tbh.I stair climb (real stairs and escalators). Some website recommends these. I can\u2019t remember the organization, but they recommended these, new balance 1080s, Karhu Ikonis, and a few others, for stair climbing.I got thes for about 60 bucks less than the Karhus. It\u2019s a bonus.Stupid point: Karhus are more of a conversation piece or more exotic. Many years ago, sauconys were this way, but now they\u2019re universally known.That said, I still think they\u2019re pretty cool.I\u2019m using them now and they feel so good! I\u2019m usually a normal width, but lean wide. The Karhus were too narrow. The Rides fit just right, to the point that I considered sending them back wides. I\u2019m just saying that you might want to try a wide if you sometimes need to buy wides. They\u2019re wider than your pumas, of course. This last paragraph seems pointless. The width is in the normal range.I\u2019d get a kick out of it, if a fellow stair climber read this and it helped them out. Best of luck to you regardless. I hope you find the right pair.EDIT: so I bought a pair of the New Balance 880s after these. I wanted to love them, but it was as though the insides were reversed. None of the support hit my foot the right way.I don\u2019t rarely by a shoe twice, but I didn\u2019t want to screw around. I got a boring grey pair this time. They\u2019re fine, but the first pair I had were black, with white and silver trim. Those were much doper than these great ones. They have peach aglets on black laces. Very cool.I don\u2019t care that my new ones look boring. They feel great!",

Edited from original: These in 10.5 wide are slightly wider than my Ride 15s are/were and feel like they have slightly have more room on top (the foot's dorsum) , and that's a good thing. The uppers are made of much nicer materials (they look nicer in any case) than the previous two generations and the laces are somehow 'better', not sure how exactly, but they are. Thank you Saucony for finally offering a colour other than blue in a wide.",
