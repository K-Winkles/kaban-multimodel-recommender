                "reviewText": "I really like these shoes. I originally bought them to for days I wear all blue but I wear them nearly every day. Originally I considered returning them because I ordered size 13 and usually that's just right but these were not as close, similar to a boot at size 13 than a sneaker but I kept it in hopes they'd be usable with thick socks. I also thought they would be good for an upcoming 1000 mile road trip for 2023 holiday because they would be easy to remove since they're loose. Instead they turned out to be excellent during the trip because I didn't feel the need to take them off while driving for so long. I've never had that before. Additionally for day to day use , I wear them to work most days and they feel great, they won't feel like anything special at first but I'm a big heavy guy and these shoes haven't gotten softer or flatter with constant use. I'm very happy with my purchase.",

Will definitely be buying different colors in the future. I like it so much I threw away my old pair of shoes and replacing everything with this brand. They also look stylish.

My only problem is that is seems to be made for skinnier feet. It hurts my feet a little when I walk any distance in them. Overall, it is a good looking shoe and very well made for an inexpensive price. I would have preferred to have tried this one on in a store first, but for the price I am definitely not disappointed.",

These were similar and a decent price.I like the shoe overall and fits as expected. What was weird and annoying is, you know the tiny balls that are put in silica packs to absorb moisture in some things? These shoes were just littered with tiny brownish colored hard balls that are the same size as in the silica packs. Scattered everywhere! Raked a lot of them out and dumped them. However they keep creeping up into the shoe from the crevices between the shoe and the insert at the bottom. After clearing them out 3-4 times and finding still another or two like a small pebble under my foot I think I've got them all removed. Used in a late stage of manufacturing for some reason? Intended to serve the purpose of silica packs? I don't know but a pain to get rid of. Would have easily given another star but really?",

                "reviewText": "I picked these up wanting a loafer similar to Vans, but not as expensive. That's pretty much exactly what they are. A cheaper knockoff of a Vans skate shoe. These are not as comfortable as Vans. Hopefully as the footbed wears in they will get a little more comfortable.These run a bit larger than other shoes of this same size, so you may want to consider buying a half size down. Or maybe a full size. See some other reviews that also mention this.These are fine to wear around the house and maybe running an errand around town if it doesn't involve much walking. They do not fit well enough for that.I probably should return these for a half size smaller and that might result in a higher rating and a more positive experience. But for the purposes of an honest review, this is exactly what you get. Getting a proper size for shoes should not be a guessing game. The sizing standards were established over a hundred years ago.I won't be buying another pair. I should have stuck with a diff brand that fit my feet better. Starts with an 'M' and rhymes with feral. I tried to get a shoe for half the price as one of those and ended up with a shoe that was half as good.",
