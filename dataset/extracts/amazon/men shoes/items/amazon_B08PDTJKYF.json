Most of the shoes I buy are either too tight or too big but these fit just right. They look great and I\u2019m gonna enjoy wearing them. They are very well-built and should last me several years. I don\u2019t know what some people do to their shoes, but a lot of people can wear out a pair of shoes in a few months. For me, it takes me years to wear out a pair of shoes. These are good looking shoes and they are super lightweight and very comfortable if you\u2019re thinking of purchasing them go for it you\u2019ll probably love them.",

Comfortanle inside, light, they dry quickly and with a very good outsole that provides lots of traction in rugged terrain.",

With my pronation and flat feet, I am especially tough on my outer heels, and I regularly purchase stick-on heel boosters/guards to compensate for the rapid heel erosion my walking style produces. I had long been devoted to another brand, having worked through multiple brands and models since I first took up serious running fifty years ago and have evolved in my golden years to walking. Looking more towards walkers than running shoes and searching for a good price on a recognized brand, I gave Saucony a try. Suffice it to say, within two weeks of making my first purchase, I purchased a second pair.I like everything about them. Stylish. Functional. Firm heel support. And an impossible to beat price, creating great value.",

                "reviewText": "I'm pretty disappointed by these shoes. I bought them with the intent to go hiking around since my hiking shoes were getting worn out and I wanted to try out something lighter weight. After they arrived, I spent about a week breaking them in before going out on any hikes. Even after a week of break-in, the outsoles were still surprisingly stiff but I did like the lightness and breathability of the shoe.I take these out on a first easy hike (<1.5mi and less than 100ft elevation gain) and was not impressed at all. The grip is not good on even dry, flat rock. They seem okay on a soft path, but as soon as I encountered any wetness, the grip is poor. Wet rocks are dangerous with these shoes and I nearly fell a few times on that first easy hike just walking around.I'm not sure what Saucony means by \"Trail Running Shoe\", but I don't think they are suitable even as a \"trail walking shoe\". I wouldn't use these for anything that isn't on a paved path.I have since decided that these shoes are not to ever be used for hiking again and have relegated them to daily wear (office job) and the gym. They are okay for that purpose. After a month, the insoles and midsoles are still too stiff and do not offer much arc support. Standing around in these shoes gets my feet aching in 30 minutes or less. They are decent for the gym since they are lightweight and breathable.Overall, I would not recommend these shoes for any purpose. There are much better options out there.",
