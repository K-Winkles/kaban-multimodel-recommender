                "reviewText": "I spent a couple years enjoying the Mizuno Supersonic Wave (volleyball shoe) for tennis. I could shove my wide feet into them and the thin soles gave me excellent court feel and never caused me to tip my ankle during lateral moves. However, they were actually too narrow (and not long enough) and I developed a neuroma and sessamoiditis. I started exploring barefoot shoes (with modified insoles for more protection; currently Xero Prio) to get the toe room but maintain the feel. Both problems amazingly went away within two weeks, however, after about 3 months, the sessamoiditis came back. Back to the drawing board - I figured I'd give traditional tennis shoes another shot. I ordered this KSwiss shoe, the New Balance 996 v4, and the Asics Gel Revolution 8 all in Mens 9.5 Wide.Quick result - I'm sending them all back.The Asics were the narrowest, very straight then rounded shape to the toe region. Their uppers are crazy plasticky, stiff, painfully uncomfortable. There's an attached sock thing on either side of the tongue and two straps across the top of the tongue to hold it in place. Both make the shoe feel even more cramped. Because of those top straps, it is not possible to get a sloppy, loose-shoe feel after a match. The bottoms were also very stiff. The outsole is sufficiently vertical and thick to make me concerned about ankle-tip.The New Balance had better width across the toe-joint ridge but the toe box is so tapered that it squished my toes painfully. They were the most flexible top and bottom. In the numbers below, you can see that the soles are the thinnest of the 3. The heel cup was shallower than the other two and, usually, I'm okay with that but didn't care for it this time.The KSwiss were both wide enough across toe-joint ridge and roomy enough for my toes to be straight and even a little splayed. The heel cup was deep with a cushiony, comfortable heel collar. The uppers have a lot of plastic like the Asics but the design is considerably more flexible there than on the Asics. The outsole has enough angle shaping that I don't think I'd ever catch and tip my ankle in them. I developed hope. I took them for a brief test drive at a clean, indoor tennis court. After less than 10 minutes I had to take them off. They have the stiffest soles of the 3 and while thick, the soles are not cushiony at all. My sessamoiditis burned immediately. Somehow, they made my pinky toe joint hurt as well. The stiffness had a significantly negative impact on my footwork. I had no agility, no ability to zip into the right place. While on court, the length felt excessive by at least a 1/2 inch. I would need to put those heel pads in to get them to fit properly.I'm returning all 3 and going back to further modifications of barefoot shoes....Data(oddly, the width and length \"feel\" tracks better with the exterior measures than insole measures, Xeros excepted)--------------Mizuno Supersonic Wave: Size 42.5B.
