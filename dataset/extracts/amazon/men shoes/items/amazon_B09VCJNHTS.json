They look cool and they are comfortable. Great traction and no issues so far. I will update this review should I have any issues when I put miles on these.Update 1: This is my second pair of Adidas Terrex shoes. My other pair are Terrex Skychaser LT GTXs. These AX4 are a little bit different. The toe box is a little bit more narrow. Not a problem for me, but keep this in mind if you have wide feet. Also, the sole and heel of the AX4 is much more firm. These are not squishy when you walk or run, but the sole is very supportive.",

They are stiff at first. Took me a week to break em in but after that it became very comfortable to wear on hikes and even at work (construction). Kept my feet dry in times of rain but I will say my feet smelt bad for the first month of wearing them. I think after the water proofing wore off of the shoe my feet was allowed to breath again and that issue was no more but that\u2019s something to be aware of.",

I'd enjoyed and worn out the previous pair.But something has drastically changed in design as noted by other reviewers feedback I'd read and wondered about - the narrowing and cramping of the toe! It was True! Didn't take but a second to notice after lacing them up. I'm not sure why they did this, but it's terrible. My shoe size is standard 8.5 and these fit very poorly. Something must've gotten loose on the production room floor! Worn Adidas all my life, but this makes it less apt I'll do so. Be interesting to hear Adidas' take on this...Ordered up a pair of Keen's, Targhee lii Hiking Sneaker - 100% leather, waterproof, beautiful fit, US made and priced less than the Terrex! Fit like a dream! 5 Star, so far.Will keep looking at Adidas, but will watch fit closely and keep an ear to the ground as to what changed and why. Any respectful comments would be appreciated. Thx!",
