I have had these on for a sum total of about 25 mins after just receiving them and they rule. This is the 3rd pair of slippers I have had to buy in about 3 years and the rest failed in the sole where your toes bend. The sole would separate from the slipper itself. I won\u2019t shame the previous brands but I will say that the sole on these is actually SEWED to the sole so I can pretty much rest in confidence knowing these won\u2019t deteriorate like my old ones\u2026\u2026maybe they will??!?!!?! In like two years??!!??!! But I\u2019m not predicting that after inspecting the craftsmanship. I\u2019m not saying that Hanes is the all time best, but for the price and what I received today, I think I made the best purchase on these slippers. Hope this helps you!! And the \u201csize of fit\u201d is on point too so trust in that!",
