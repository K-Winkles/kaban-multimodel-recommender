                "reviewText": "This is my second pair of Lae'ahi Lauhalas. Look great and are comfortable! First pair was a 10M and just a tad too large, was a little too wide and heel slipped a bit. My foot is 11\" long and 4.5\" wide; I wear a 10D boot, 10.5C and 10D dress shoe, 10.5 Vasque, Salmon hiking boots and size 11 Merrill hiking boot. Ordered Lae'ahi Lauhala in size 9.5 this time and they fit perfectly!I have had the first pair for over a year now and over time noticed the same problem with foot odor mentioned by other reviewers. A little foot powder and the odor goes away. It's been below freezing here since my second pair arrived -- so, too early to tell about foot door.I have not had any issue with durability as noted by some other reviewers. The first pair look brand new. But I do NOT wear mine a lot; primarily around the house and while driving. So not a real test of durability, i.e not on the beach, hiking over lava, backpacking (though I'm not understanding how users would expect this lightweight shoe to stand up to those conditions!)Would highly recommend this shoe for lightweight use (i.e. not 24/7 trail use!)",

All day comfort, I wore them to Hawaii and wore them walking on the beach, sidewalks, blacktop and lava. The shoes handled them all with no discomfort. Wore them all day without socks. Without a doubt the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.",
