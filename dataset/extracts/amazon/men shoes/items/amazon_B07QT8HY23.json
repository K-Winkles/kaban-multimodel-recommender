Far more than I thought I'd aquire in a pair of sandals.I can't attest to their durability, I just haven't had them or worn them enough to say. They do appear to be well constructed with sturdy materials. I'm hopeful they will have good longevity.I purchased these a half size larger what I usually get. I've not had good luck ordering shoes online. The half size larger or maybe it's because they are sandals, I'm not sure but the fit is good. Now if I could just get on that vacation.",

Needless to say they just have been sitting in the closet ever since then and recently went in the garbage. I reckon I should have sent them back but time never did allow! I dont know if it was just a bad batch or what but decided to take a chance on another set of brown (briar) ones in 2023 and they fit great like my old ones did, I can only hope they will last as long!",
