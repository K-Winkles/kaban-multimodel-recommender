                "reviewText": "I originally purchased the Rivera 2s to be my daily use shoe. I wasn\u2019t sure I could walk in them as I had been using orthotics in \u201cnormal\u201d running shoes. I have narrow low volume feet, but I like my toes to be free, so I was excited to find altra made a shoe with my fit in mind. I can wear these with normal thickness socks. Differences between the 2 and 3, from my point of view. The tongue is thinner or less padded, and I\u2019m still getting used to it. The shoe feels a little more stiff, but that\u2019s probably because they are still new. I don\u2019t like the look of the toe from the top. The 2s have the toe guard and reflective strip, and that kind of breaks up the look a bit. I do really like the sole on the 3s. The black parts on the sole of the 2s start to come off at the corners, and then they catch on things. The green inserts in the 3s seem better positioned to stay adhered to the shoe. The laces on the 3s don\u2019t hold quite as well as the 2s, but it\u2019s not a huge difference. I purchased the Rivera 3 to use as my walking shoes. So far I like them, but I would have also been fine with another pair of the 2s. I can\u2019t really run, but I have done a little run/walking and they feel great. They are comfortable and well cushioned, and I have enjoyed them as my daily shoe. I would recommend them, and I look forward to trying more of Altra\u2019s slim fit shoes.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to love these, but I think they're killing my feet. I have completely flat feet + hyper-flexible ankles so I need podiatrist-recommended supportive shoes & Altra was one of the brands she mentioned. Got custom insoles made & started wearing Torin5 the last couple years. I recently decided to try Rivera3 to compare how they feel & support, plus I like the look of the Rivera3 better. The Rivera tongue is so much better than Torin (Torins have the WORST tongue design ever put into an athletic shoe) & I like the Rivera laces as they are a little satiny but still sturdy.I thought I loved the shoe ... until I'd been wearing them a few days or so. My feet started hurting & my outer ankle swelling up like a baseball. So looks like this shoe just doesn't have the support I need in one or more of various ways.Super disappointed because I really wanted them to work out.",
