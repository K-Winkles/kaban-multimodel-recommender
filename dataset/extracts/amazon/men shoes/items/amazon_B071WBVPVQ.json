                "reviewText": "I bought these because of the great luck I've had with the last pair of Merrells I bought nearly 8 years ago. Now THOSE were comfortable out of the box. Sanuks and Hey Dudes are comfortable out of the box... These are the OJ of footwear. The footbed is hard as a rock and the Vibram outer sole is stiff and not pliable. Wore them for a 4 hour half work day and thought I was gonna die. It took seemingly endless 2-3 hour stints to get them to the point they are today. They do get better. The only thing I could do to make them bearable was to switch the removable insoles with a set from a new pair of Hey Dudes. Remarkably the switch made both shoes better.I've now got about 40 or so hours of actually standing/walking time in them. They have softened up about 50% but still now what I'd consider a truly comfortable shoe. I wear mine on heavy rain days because unlike Sanuks and Hey Dudes, the chunky Vibram soles keep my feet dry above the parking lot puddles at work. They seem to breath well and have a roomy toe box. Excellent traction btw.Seems like a quality shoe, but whoever says they're comfortable out of the box either has nerve damage or feet made of steel. Either way just be prepared for a month long break in of an hour or two a day.",

While not waterproof, they stand up to the rain nicely - there are waterproof Merrills. Dirty? Take out the shoe strings and throw them in the wash. They'll come out looking almost new.I have a foot that is a bit wide and these fit perfectly, but if your foot is narrow, don't be afraid to get these. Right now, I own three pairs: the one pictured here, one of the original Moab colors and one for working around the yard. I love the ones pictured here because they are a gorgeous light green. My wife can vouch for Merrills - man or woman, you can't go wrong with any one of the Merrill family of walkers, hikers.Merrills used to have a thin collar at the heel, and after a lot of wear, it would begin to tear. The new ones don't do that.If you're looking for a pair of walkers that look great on your feet, are comfortable and will last, get these.",

                "reviewText": "Ces chaussures sont \u00e0 peine plus lourdes que des tennis et tr\u00e8s confortables. Elles sont particuli\u00e8rement adapt\u00e9es pour des randonn\u00e9es l\u00e9g\u00e8res. En d\u00e9pit de l'aspect plut\u00f4t \"\u00e9t\u00e9\" que donne le mesh, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9ablement surpris car j'ai les pieds bien au chaud par des temp\u00e9ratures voisines de 0\u00b0. En revanche ne pas croire que vous ferez confortablement une randonn\u00e9e de 3 heures dans la neige.En effet, la chaussure reste tout de m\u00eame plut\u00f4t une chaussure d'\u00e9t\u00e9 n'\u00e9tant pas montante. Notez bien \u00e9galement qu'elle n'est pas doubl\u00e9e en Goretex. L'aspect est qualitatif : les mati\u00e8res (cuir et mesh) sont solides, bien assembl\u00e9es. La semelle en Vibram, est pourvue de nombreux crampons, le grip est excellent, tr\u00e8s s\u00e9curisant pour les zones rocheuses, m\u00eame par temps humide.Comme souvent chez Merrell n'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 prendre une bonne taille au-dessus. Je fais usuellement du u du 44 et ici il m'a fallu opter pour du 45 pour avoir une chaussure qui reste tr\u00e8s ajust\u00e9e.En bref, une excellente chaussure de randonn\u00e9e, l\u00e9g\u00e8re, bien finie et \u00e0 un prix tout \u00e0 fait int\u00e9ressant.",
