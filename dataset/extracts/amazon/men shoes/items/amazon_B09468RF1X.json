                "reviewText": "They are beautiful, decently constructed in terms of the knit top of the shoe. The color is the exact vibrant orange that I usually have to spend $200 to get in a sneaker. That is where the positives end.The shoe appears to be made by someone without feet. If you have ever worn wooden clogs, you will know more joy and comfort than these sneakers could ever bring you. They sound like \u201cwomen\u2019s shoes walking down an empty hallway\u201d no matter what surface you are on. Somehow they \u2018click, click, click\u2019 at all times when on the move. The show itself doesn\u2019t give or flex at all, so your toe slaps down hard with each step. It feels a bit like clown shoes actually.The fit itself just feels wrong. Modern sneakers, especially those knit with elastic materials. wrap around and conform to the foot without binding the toes. It\u2019s become expected since you find it even on bargain $25 department store brand sneakers- but not here. It almost feels like you are wearing the left sneaker on your right foot and the other one backwards on your foot.The \u201csole\u201d of this sneaker is made out of HARD plastic and some type of hard rubber I\u2019ve never witnessed before. There is no grip, no flex, no absorption of impact while walking, nothing at all. It\u2019s like walking on strangely shaped boards.I REALLY wanted to like these shoes and even tried to justify keeping them for a single event since they look nice. But they are so terrible to stand in, let alone walk in, that I just can\u2019t keep them. I will keep looking at shoes made by this company since they know how to make attractive shoes. Hopefully they figure out how to make them for human feet and not just horses.TO THE MANUFACTURER: I\u2019m really sorry I can\u2019t say more positive things about the shoes. Please direct me to another pair that looks like this but has more comfort and I will happily buy and review them. Good luck! You have a great visual designer, but you can\u2019t skimp on ergonomics and material quality.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I ran a 5k 5 times a week for about three months in these shoes. They worked reasonably well for running. They are a little on the heavy side, however. I would not recommend them for doing your daily chores because of the way the soles are made. They can get caught on things and I think they\u2019re dangerous. There\u2019s a fall hazard that doesn\u2019t really exist for running because you\u2019re not on stairs but I definitely wouldn\u2019t use these as cross trainers. TheTop of the shoes are made well. The sole of the shoes don\u2019t wear terribly well. The rubber treads on the shoes wear down pretty quickly. You can still run in them after the treads are worn off. If you\u2019re looking for running shoes, I can\u2019t recommend these they\u2019re not lightweight enough and they\u2019re not cushioned enough. I would recommend getting a pair of traditional running shoes. I bought a pair called PWRRUN. They were not expensive and have traditional soul and they\u2019re much more lightweight and cushy.",
