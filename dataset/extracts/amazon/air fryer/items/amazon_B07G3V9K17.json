                "reviewText": "After much consideration and online research, we bought this Philips Air Fryer. My husband wanted a large capacity, I wanted something that would let him eat the fried foods he loves and me not suffer from grease-induced heartburn woes. This air fryer is all we could have wished for, and more. It is a bit difficult to get grease off the burner element at the top of the air fryer after a bacon-frying session, but otherwise easy to use and keep clean. My first try at using it was to make blackberry hand pies, a treat I remembered from my youth. I found a recipe online, made it up, and the results were terrific. So easy to do, the results outside-crispy, inside-moist, and absolutely delicious. We find ourselves using this air fryer several times a week, and not a single thing we've made has been less than delicious. Fried chicken came out amazing, battered halibut filets were better even than deep-fat fried, chicken-fried steaks were stupendous. And not a hint of heartburn, either!The size is workable for keeping on a counter top, we just push it against the back wall when not in use, pull it forward 5\" or so when we're cooking with it. The top is flat, the black surface is easily kept clean and looks great with my other black kitchen appliances. The basket is very large, and you can get quite a bit of food in it at once. It says you can cook a 5.5 lb whole chicken in it, though we haven't tested that out yet. It has a pause feature that lets you open the unit, shake the contents around or turn pieces, then resume cooking as before without having to re-set everything. The basket assembly easily comes apart for cleaning, and it all goes in the dishwasher just fine. The fryer is amazingly quiet when running, and the controls on the front panel are easy to learn to use. My one and only complaint is that the cooking temperature is adjustable only in 25 degree increments. Most recipes call for much finer-tuning of temperature, and we've had to learn to make adjustments for that each time we work with a new recipe. Having the ability to adjust temperature from 350 to 360, for instance, would eliminate having to keep detailed notes and trial-and-error runs to get cooking times just right for greatly differing temperatures than the recipe calls for.We chose the Philips brand because all of the serious online reviews (from America's Test Kitchen, for instance) rated the Philips at the top of their lists, as reliable, durable, and easy to use. It was more pricey than other brands, true, but we figured that we would be using it for a long time to come and would be glad we paid the extra for the quality that Philips delivers. This air fryer has added a welcome and delicious new dimension to our culinary world.",

                "reviewText": "I own a smaller Philips air fryer model HD9621 that unit works great. It is a few years old now, and while it mostly handles the food volume perfectly for two people, it doesn't handle the volume that you would have for four or more.To accommodate having friends and family over where the air fryer would be used, it was time to shop for a larger capacity model. While there are similar capacity models available that have a smaller price tag, I opted to remain loyal to Philips brand name. All of the Philips brand items that I have used over the years have been trouble free and are still working.There are some particular aspects of this unit that I would like to call out.1) Temperature settings change in 25 degree steps. 300 to 325 to 350, etc. In all of the time that I used my older HD9621 model, I never found it necessary to cook at 315 degrees, for example. All cooking or reheating was at the \"typical\" temperature settings that these 25-degree graduations work fine for.2) The basket for food does not \"click\" into the overall basket, which is not a real issue, but it did take a little adjusting to since the HD9621 does click together.3) the overall size of the food basket doesn't \"look\" that much larger than the HD9621 basket, even though it is rated almost two times the capacity. Visual appearances can be deceiving. I have already found I can cook more in than I could in the smaller HD9621.4) The XXL series has a very large footprint on your counter. If you are going to keep it out all the time, this may not be an issue. If you want to be able to store it away, it requires a good deal of space planning. Pay attention to the published dimensions, and if you have a tough time visualizing them, do yourself a favor and use a ruler or tape measure to better understand how large this appliance is.In my opinion, the cooking surface area has a better coating than Philips was using originally in their air fryers, and it cleans up easily enough.In the end, yes, I would purchase this again. I would recommend it to friends and family.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a Philips air fryer almost 10 years ago. I've loved using it but needed a replacement because it was looking pretty beat up. I stuck with the same brand because I was so happy with my old one. I have to say the new design is quite nice. It seems to clean up easier, especially with the removable bottom in the cooking \"bucket.\" The price has come down a lot too, which is always nice. A slight negative is the temperature control. When I tried cooking corn dogs with the same time and temp as my old model, the food was still cold in the middle. I even got out my grill Therma pen to check to see if this product actually got to the selected temperature. The good news is that is does, but the bad news is that it took over 5 minutes to get there. And the temperature isn't as steady as you'd think. It fluctuated and even went a little higher. That's not a big deal to me as I don't bake in my air fryer. The instructions say this air fryer doesn't need to be preheated, but I've not found that to be true. I still like the product, but I just need to adjust how I use it.",

                "reviewText": "This Phillips Premium Airfryer XXL is great. I have used it most days since purchase, about 3 months. Easy to use, well designed and well made. Easy to separate the fryer basket to clean and it fits back together with no effort. The non-stick coating is perfect.This airfyer needs no preheating and it recalculates preset cooking times to account for reheating after the basket is opened and closed when you add or turn food. No preheating is a huge advantage! This airfryer provides good control over cooking and has good presets.The big basket will fit a very small chicken or lots of pieces and the accessory to double the cooking layers works well for larger families. Food tastes better and there is no oil cooking smell in the house. I just smell the cooking food, delicious.It takes some learning and weighing of ingredients at first like any new cooker or microwave. Turning or tossing the food half way through the time is important.Being able to walk away while it fries is great. I don't have to watch it constantly as I do when frying in oil. Having heat safe handles and a cooler outer layer is good. Be sure not to fill the basket above it's top. This will prevent food touching the element above.Crumbed food, crispy poultry, sizzling meats, fresh veges and home made french fries are amazing in this!Fresh wet battered foods are more of a challenge in all airfryers as the batter drips before the heat can seal it. Fish and chips are easier if the fish is crumbed or purchased prebattered for cooking. All the recipes I find are for crumbed foods, not battered. Maybe cooking wet battered food on a paper liner for the first half of the time will work. I am yet to try this. I have not tried baking in it yet either.This will feed 4 people 1 part of a meal easily. Layering the veges on a rack over the sizzling meat works well for 4 people. Keeping the cooked food warm in an oven will let you cook more batches and feed many more people or have courses served together.",
