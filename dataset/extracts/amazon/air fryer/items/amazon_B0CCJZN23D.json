After it cooled I used a paper towel to wipe off any crumbs. That was it. and that was nice. I totally recommend the fryer. And I got the add on piece so I can cook multiple things at the same time.",

                "reviewText": "My air fryer stopped working and I used it less than 10 times. It had just passed the return window for Amazon but since it has a one-year warranty, I had to contact Nuwave directly and it took over 3 weeks - almost a full month - to get a new one! It\u2019s been over 3 weeks and it\u2019s \u201con the way\u201d but still has not arrived. I recommend just ordering a new one from Amazon and send the faulty one back to them. I will not buy another one from this company if this happens again",

                "reviewText": "I did a lot of research before I made this purchase, not just with Amazon reviews, but others as well. I always start with the one star reviews. I always want to know what others did not like about it. Some noted the finish came off the fry draw very early on. I read a \"blog\" that said, \"never use a fat spray product on the airfryer because it has chemical that might react harshly with the finish. I have never used a spray. I bought oil sprayer. I have never put it in the dishwasher. After it pre-heats, I place a piece of tinfoil in the bottom. When finished I remove the tinfoil and it cleans up with a few swishes of a dishcloth. It is so easy to clean. Initially, there was a bit of an odor from the product, but it never penetrated the food, and it disappeared after a few uses. I have made salmon, beef filets, beef shish kebobs and reheated fried chicken from the local fried chicken store (It tasted perfectly fresh). I have also cooked vegetables.. I am in my middle 80s and was tired of cooking meals. I might make a double amount of vegetables and reheat them a few nights later. Using the Airfryer is so much easier than cooking with regular pots and pans.",

Super crispy, moist and delicious. Right after that I made some fries which also turned out very well, just be sure to shake the basket half way through cooking so that everything gets crispy.Highly recommend this unit, I am excited to us the baking pan next!",
