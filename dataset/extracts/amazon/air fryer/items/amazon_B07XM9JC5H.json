                "reviewText": "Decided to get an air fryer to make my own stuff and eat out less, and this was on sale. Wasn't enthusiastic about the color, but it's not too hideous. Used it to make my own potato wedges, fries, chicken wings (from frozen), and heated up frozen fish sticks. So far, they worked great.Potato wedges and fries needs almost no prep. Just cut them up into wedges or slices not too big, toss them into the basket and I set them to cook at 350 for 8 minutes. Works every time. May need to turn them over and add another 4 minutes if your wedges are pretty thick. Add any sort of powder flavor you want. I've tried mixed spice, curry powder, even the flavor packets from ramen noodles.The frozen fish sticks came out crispy like fresh fries with 12 minutes at 400. They are so crispy I was thinking about dialing back the temp a little. Don't overlap the fish sticks, leave a little room around each one.The wings require a little more prep. Add some cooking spray to the inside, and line up the wings along the sides and basically make sure nothng touches. Do 8 minutes @ 400, take them out, turn them a bit, then another 5 minutes or so @ 350. The skin will be crispy and most of the fat would have dripped to the bottom.Cleanup is pretty easy: pull the cup out, remove the inner liner, dump out the bits, and wipe it down. The cup probably has a lot of fat dripping in it and requires a little dish detergent, but that's about it. Turn it on for a minute or two and the insides will be dry for another use.All in all, love the little thing. It doesn't have fancy presets or digital controls, but don't really need it.",

Very easy to clean, just take the basket out of the bottom part and wipe clean then snap it back together. It's very easy to use. It works best when there's not too much in the basket, one or two layers with a lot of room for the air to circulate. If you overfill it then it will cook but it won't get crunchy. The outside doesn't get hot and it's never set off the fire alarm like I've heard some other models do. Things cook very quickly too. I love it.",

                "reviewText": "Had been curious about air fryers so I bought this smaller one during the holiday sales. Very simple design, easy to use. Does make good french fries and sweet potato fries.The cons are:-- the timer dial is impossible to read unless you are at eye level - I will probably have to use whiteout or the like to mark where the dial indicator is to make it legible.-- the fit of the plastic case isn't the best, it is possible to get the basket assembly in at a slight angle which then doesn't seal.-- the smooth and sleek case could really use a handle in the back to hold while you are sliding the basket assembly in.All in all, relatively pleased with the value of what I bought. If we really use this regularly, I might consider buying a more upscale model, but for infrequent use this is fine.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love air frying. In my opinion it's basically a turbo version of an oven. Heats up almost instantly so no need to spend about 500 hours pre heating an oven. I have both their 2qt versions and I needed a bigger one for when I have guests come over.Usage: Super simple, adjust the temperature and set timeClean: There is a button on top of the handle you can press to remove the basket from the assembly to easily clean it. I just use detergent and the soft side of a sponge. Since it's non stick, it's easily cleaned.Tested: I have made steak medallions and chicken wings super easy. I am yet to test seafood though.Bonus: Take advantage of the 2year warranty this comes with by registering your product. I had an issue with one of the smaller ones and they replaced it for me!Hint: With any air fryer, make sure you rotate/shake a few times throughout the cooking to get even cooking.Gift: Air fryers make an awesome gift for those who don't have one. Once you use one, you will always use it!",

                "reviewText": "The timer dial knob on this unit is made from cheap plastic and turns a \"D-shaft\" to start the cooking process. The knob WILL eventually break, depending on how frequently you use the unit. If you're still within your warranty period, you may get an entirely new unit. Outside of warranty, you're out of luck. I was told they don't stock replacement knobs but that I \" could try to use some heat resistant adhesive and reattach the one you have.\" They're telling me to glue it back together, which will not hold up to the torque required to turn the shaft. These cheap knobs have to cost less than a dollar to make and a good customer service approach (given the frailty of the plastic knob) would be to mail out a replacement knob free-of-charge when they break. The sad part is, the air fryer itself is a good product. Now I'm stuck with having to turn the shaft with pliers or find some generic knob that will fit the shaft. DASH product design and customer service is a total fail.",

Both attempts ( chicken drummetts and yam fries turned out perfectly cooked and crispy.The non stick is fantastic and clean up easy4 drummets fresh coated in shake n bake cooked at 400 F for 22 minutes turned twiceandwestern family frozen plank cut yam fries cooked 400F 20 minutes turned 3 timesvery pleased and that\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to donot so pleased with ?it\u2019s analog and now I know why digital would be better but in fairness I chose to buy an analog machine so my faultit\u2019s not exact, can\u2019t pause it. The timing dial has no friction on the surface of the dial so it\u2019s hard to grip especially if you have any grease in your fingers.The indicator can be lined up with minute settings but it\u2019s not easy to see.The temp dial is loose it rotates too easily and there is no indication of where to line up the desired temp to. It\u2019s easy for 400F because it\u2019s as far as it will turn but lower temps ? good luck. will try a sharpie to mark the point where it stops at 400 and line up lower temps to thatThe inner basket has to be in the bigger one to use it and it\u2019s not that big so the machine is much bigger than the compact version ( I have that one in digital ) but the actual cooking area isn\u2019t proportionally bigger.If you are a lady with long nail pushing the button to remove the inner pot is frustratingOnce the inner pot is out ( the handle is attached to it ) there is no easy way to grab the outer bin. It\u2019s all smooth sides. Some kind of handle grip on it would be helpfulOverall $88 for this was very good value and cooking wise, which is the most important point it delivered on so felt 4 stars was the fair ratingHope you find this info and the pics helpful",
