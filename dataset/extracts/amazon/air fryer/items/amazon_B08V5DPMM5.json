My last airfryer lasted quite a while and I was very happy with it so I was bummed when I had to purchase another after it suddenly stopped working. I did quite a bit of research and wanted something that was a little larger but not too large that it took up too much counter space. I also wanted something easy to use. This met all of the criteria. It it easy to use, makes food super crispy, is easy to clean and takes up less counter space than other brands. It also didn't have any strange smell that many people complain of when they first use their air fryer. I also thought the price point was very reasonable.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this air fryer a year ago to replace my old air fryer that I had for 5 years prior (one of the original \u201cAs Seen on TV Air Fryers\u201d). I did a LOT of research on air fryers before purchasing this one, comparing reviews and product dimensions to ensure that I had the appropriate counter space to fit it (it is a little larger and square-shaped compared to the round-shaped one that I had before). I\u2019m telling you it is worth it!When you first use it, there is a strong metallic smell that comes from it that can be a bit alarming, but by the second or third use the smell is completely gone. I\u2019ve had this air fryer for a year now and it still works just as great as it did on day one and is very easy to use. It fits a lot of food in it and the alert it gives, reminding you to turn your food, is super helpful. I make sure to hand wash it in between heavy use (cooking raw and frozen foods) but not as often in between reheating, unless there are spills, and it is still in great condition.I\u2019ve used it to cook salmon, chicken, baked potatoes, and veggies. I once baked cookies in it and they came out pretty good. They just expanded slightly less than they would have in an oven. Of course, I cook up frozen foods in it (French fries, chicken nuggets, breakfast sausage, fried shrimp) and love the reheat setting when I want to quickly heat up and re-crisp leftovers. I use it at least a couple times a week. My sister bought the same air fryer at the same time that I bought mine and she loves hers too. If I haven\u2019t said it already, BUY IT!",

Every reason why people like them, I agree with and as far as brands, we\u2019ve always been happy with Instant Pot.",

I lost money on this one since I sold my Ninja to get this one. and now will pay full price again. (lesson learned).Things I noticed was that the door sticks so you really have to yank it open. The plastic looks cheap and as I mentioned it has marks on this one? I was not crazy about the cooking either. I followed the recipe and ribs were burned on outside and not soft on inside even though I lowered the temp. The instructions were simple. Maybe the more expensive Instant Vortex is better but I was not happy with this one. Such a pain to return.",

In the middle of the test run, the drawer needs to be removed and placed back, when I put the drawer back in, the display says \"Open\". I unplugged the unit but it was still stuck on open. I contacted Instant customer support, the first girl told me to make a video of the problem and send that with the receipt and codes. When I had completed that, I waited on hold for over an hour and the guy just told me to return to Amazon and ended the chat without letting me reply. I'm pissed about this, we bought groceries specifically for this air fryer and had a meal prepared and ready to be cooked when this happened. No apology or concern from the company, like this happens all the time. After researching Instant brand air fryers online, I realized that they actually have tons of known issues and defects. The whole unit just felt cheap and crappy straight out of the box. Very disappointed. I will never buy this brand again.",
