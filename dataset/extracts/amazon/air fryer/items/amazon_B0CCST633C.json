I prefer this type to the basket because you can see your food and it has different height levels for your racks. Grease easily falls to a lower rack for no fuss cleanup. Pretty large, but still fits on the countertop just fine. Only con is that you can't adjust the temp or timing once you've set it. You'll have to cancel the setting and restart. Not a huge issue though.",

                "reviewText": "My family got into buying Green Pan products awhile ago, so I finally caved on buying this to go along with our collection! They make such pretty pans, but aside from that, they work beautifully and hold up the best out of anything we\u2019ve ever had!This all-in-one slow cooker is AMAZING! I got rid of my CrockPots and won\u2019t use anything else. Seems pricy at first but well worth the investment! Sometimes when you buy items that do more than one thing, no one thing is done super well. That is not the case with this product!",

I hate splattering grease so I thought this was the answer.One drawback is when the burgers are done and you open the lid, the grease runs outside the back behind the drip pan. An unfortunate flaw.",

                "reviewText": "This thing is amazing. We\u2019ve had it for a week. We upgraded from a small toaster oven and cannot be happier. I\u2019ve never used an air fryer before so I\u2019m still getting used to that, but that function has worked well when I\u2019ve tried it. I was confused by the toast function at first because it doesn\u2019t have a timer like the other functions do. But you just set the toast level and it stops on its own, and does a good job every time. The unit does get hot on the outside, but the handle doesn\u2019t, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. I just made sure the cord doesn\u2019t touch any part of the back, because the back gets VERY hot.",

It said it would. But boy, fire alarm comes off.I disconnected it and figured, maybe I did not clean good enough. Waited for next day, wiped the whole thing again. Same thing.Third time, I really was looking where the smoke was coming from. The smoke was coming from the inside, it was like burning something inside. Between the base and the grill pan.Since that was something I could not wipe or wash, I ended up returning it.Thanks!",

Toast feature works pretty well for a bagel. Anything on air fry stays soggy. The unit gets pretty hot - and so does the plug which is why I wont use it for anything longer than a half hour bake.All in all it takes up too much precious counter space to be worth it, I wouldnt buy it again.",
