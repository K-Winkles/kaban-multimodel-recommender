They shipped them folded and bagged FLAT... it's a silicone mold that needs to be in the shape of a square for an airfryer. As you can see from the photos, it definitely does NOT keep its shape. I hoped that after using it a few times it might but, it doesn't. Makes it hard to use, hard to clean and almost impossible to store.
