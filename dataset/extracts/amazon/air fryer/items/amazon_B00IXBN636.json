I was too late and the oven was delivered. Thankfully, the add was wrong. It is 20 wide, 13 deep, 12 high.It is really a nice size and works great. I bought it to replace a 2 door air fryer oven that set off my smoke alarm and was a mess to clean. This item is much easier to clean and doesn't set off my smoke detector. The controls are fairly easy and become intuitive if you read the manual.It works great on pizza. I mainly use it for air frying meats. I bought a cheap bake tray at dollar tree that I use to catch the greece and it makes the oven easy to clean. I use it for almost every meal and it works fine.The trays are deep enough for me to fix 2 burgers, some mushrooms, and asparagus on the same tray. This is my 3rd air fryer oven and it is already my favorite.",

Cooking temperatures are even. The air fry basket and multiple (shelves) are an extra as is the enamel broiling rack and baking pan. The unit is easy to operate and clean. The \"Smart\" preset cooking/baking temperatures, and the included temperature probe, are nice additional \"features\". I just received my Bravo XL yesterday and I couldn't be more happy with it. I just tried it for the first time to get a feel for it and I have to say WOW !!! I'm just getting started exploring all the features of this oven, but so far, it's surpassed my expectations. The very first feature I utilized was the air fryer, to my complete satisfaction it did not disappoint. Take a look at the Crispy Air Fried Fish Fillets ! YUM ! I'm particularly pleased at the even heating inside the oven chamber -- no hot or cold spots -- everything comes out evenly cookedI very much enjoy cooking, and have used similar products like this one in my many years of preparing food. I thought the instructions were a bit vague but I easily figured it out as it is easy to use from the first use. I didn't whip up anything fancy but something simple. I had fresh battered fish fillets so I set the oven to air fry and the temperature sets automatically. I set the timer for 10 minute and just like that I had delirious hot fish that was as good if not better because I didn't use a single drop of oil. A little sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper the the fish fillets were flavorable and crisp. I'm thoroughly addicted and can't wait to try all the many other foods I can prepare next ! There is a bit of learning curve so I caution everyone to please read the instruction book that comes with the oven. It is fairly easy to figure out and the instructions booklet breaks everything down.After learning how it works, the oven is great, easy to use, accurate, and cooks excellently. It is very flexible for cooking different foods and cooking styles, and the recipe book will come in handy as well.This convection oven has a ton of different settings to meet all of your cooking needs...I really enjoy having a probe included with the oven as it's always good to have a food thermometer handy. The airfryer makes frozen goods more crisp than if you were using a traditional oven. And, it cooks any meat (poultry, pork, beef, seafood etc.) without a problem. As for baked goods, using the \"bake\" setting is a snap ! The biggest pro is how fast it heats up and gets to cooking. It doesn't take nearly as long as my traditional stove-top oven. I can't wait to see what the dehydrator will accomplish, and also the yogurt function \ud83d\ude03 The Bravo XL is truly a \"One Stop Shop\"and I would 100% recommend the NuWave Bravo XL to anyone looking for a new toaster oven and/or anyone trying to get their feet wet, so to speak, with new adventures in cooking !\ud83d\ude0a",

                "reviewText": "I've had this oven for about a month at this writing. The presets are quite useful. So are the buttons on the front, like Toast. All controls are digital. Time and temperature is changed by rotating a knob. Stop and start is accomplished by pressing the knob.It beeps really loud every time you press a button. The first thing I looked up in the manual was the Mute function (press SEAR + STAGE simultaneously). I just have to keep an eye on it when it is running to figure out when it turns off.You can change the time and temp on the fly. It's very easy to add a little more time. When you open the door, there are hooks on the inside of the door that pull out the rack a little if you use the center position. Good for toast, for example. The top gets pretty warm and I use that to preheat plates.It is a convection oven and an air fryer. The convection fan is on the right side of the unit along with the controls. When using the convection baking, it is a really good idea to rotate the food in the oven periodically since the side closest to the fan will get hotter. Unlike an air fryer that blows down from the top, the hot side is the right side. I had an air fryer that had the fan mounted in the top and the heat when air frying was much more even, direct and effective. Since it was blowing across the top mounted heater elements. Not so here. I think the higher the temperature, the greater the unbalance. Your mileage may vary.All in all, it's a good toaster oven for the money. You can get fairly large things inside thanks to the side mounted circulating fan. You just have to be mindful to turn the dish every five or ten minutes for even cooking.",

                "reviewText": "Great little oven it works perfectly for me as a mostly single person. And plenty big enough to use when my kids are here.However, and I saw a post before buying the oven about it being confusing to use. I thought that was a silly thing to say.I was you need to pay attention when toggling between functions. To turn the oven on there is an On/Off button,than a menu button, than toggle to bake, toggle to oven temp, and than toggle to cooking time, and finally push the start button. If you mess that up the oven won\u2019t start preheating which leaves you starting the process over. And there several other functions as well, not just bake.I am sure given time and more use; this will become second nature.I would not buy this for my mom. She has a hard enough time using a flip phoneThe oven is jam packed full of functions, features and buttons. In my mind sometimes less is more.",
