I did a lot of looking on Amazon - read reviews - then YouTube reviews. I decided on the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo. I think it has the best features and better reviews than its competitors even when compared to more expensive air fryers.I've used it twice so far - frozen french fries. Planning on making other things in the near future. The first time - I followed the instruction on the bag of Or-Ida crinkle cut fries. Did the shake - (love the shake reminder - and that I can select or not). Checked a minute or so before the timer when off. The fries were over cooked - but still edible.The next time - same fries - I followed the Cosori cookbook guideline. MUCH better. They still cooked a bit faster than the recommended time. I'll have to play around with the time - I think I got the temp correct. The air fryer cooked them SO much faster than my oven and kept the kitchen cooler. A BIG plus on both counts.I love the removable inner basket and the outer basket that catches all the crumbs - versus just a plate in other models that will fall out when you dump out your food. SO easy to remove the inner basket. Also loved the safety latch that you must slide to remover the inner basket. It keeps you from accidentally removing the inner basket by mistake. The basket size if perfect too.The touch pad controls are easy to use and very intuitive. I didn't have to re-read the manual to use. Cleanup was easy too. Dish soap and a paper towel on both the inner and outer baskets. Dry - done.I'm planning on cooking some zucchini - and - or - eggplant in it soon. Cut into slabs - season - cook. I like both but don't cook because I didn't want the mess of actually frying them in oil in a pan and the extra oil required. I may actually get some veggies in my body with the air fryer. Will probably try some other items too.I am VERY pleased with my purchase of the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo. Thank you for a well thought out and designed product.",

                "reviewText": "I see most of the small kitchen appliances like the InstaPot, expensive programmable rice cookers and specialty ovens as gadgets that do perform well but often not well enough to make it off the shelf enough to justify the expense. Like my sous vide, it works very well but not quite as convenient as I'd hoped. I thought the air fryer was just that, a fad or craze. My initial InstaPot airfryer left a lingering plastic odor and got sent back. The Cosori was recommended and on sale so I took a chance. I've had (and frequently used) it for the last 6 months and I stand corrected.We in fact, use it 2-3 times per week. Chicken wings, thighs, reheating pizza, shepherd's pie, biscuits, fish, fries, turovers, tots, french bread pizza, homemade donuts, bacon and the list goes on. Especially good for snacks (grandkids) you would normally do in an oven like taquitos, pizza rolls, mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders only much faster. Add a silicone baking dish and you expand the possibilities even more. The Cosori heats up quickly, is easy to clean and the two-piece basket is big enough to cook for 2-3 adults. I can have a meal on the table in under 20 minutes and they are delicious. I rarely give 5 stars across the board for any product but after 6 months, I've used the Cosori Air Fryer to do everything I needed it to do. I would highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I remember when Microwaves were a thing and some people swear by toaster ovens. I'm old fashioned, love to cook from-scratch meals and I rarely use a microwave except to reheat. I have a 5 burner Wolf electric stove top and double JennAir wall ovens so I resisted the whole Air Fryer craze until now and after using my Cosori 5.8 quart for a little while have to admit I am unimpressed. So for real cooks I'd like to break down some of the positives and negatives.The pros...........It preheats much faster than any full size oven. In general it is less messy and I've already purchased paper liners made for air fryers that fit the basket , can withstand the heat and there is no clean-up at all. It can leave a crispy outside to the food. It is much faster cooking. I can melt the cheese on a sandwich in no time, or warm bread without toasting. I would not do these things in a microwave, which ruins food and this is so much easier than preheating a full size oven. Cooking breakfast sausage is a breeze.The negatives.........If you think 5.8 quarts is big, well it isn't. I cook for 2 and I could never see attempting a meal in this. I don't buy much from the freezer section, but frozen fries don't cook any faster in this than in a skillet on the stove with a little oil, and I think the skillet version taste better. Until you perfect each item expect to stop and check your food over and over to see if it is done. The crispy part can also mean the food is tougher. Since overcrowding can be a problem, if you are cooking in batches, expect to use your full size oven to keep food warm. Even to warm something this has to be preheated, unlike a microwave. The unit is loud, both preheating and cooking. I tried to capture just how loud in my short video. It's louder than my dishwasher.I want every meal cooked to perfection and I think air fryers are more of a convenience. Like microwaves, it's ease and speed over quality. If many of your foods come from the freezer section , this is a great buy and works well and fast, but I haven't found any item this cooks better than my stovetop or oven.",
