                "reviewText": "I loved using my previous air fryer and was nervous that this would not function as well. I wanted this item because I had a toaster oven that was getting a lot of use as well as the air fryer. When I redid my kitchen I wanted to consolidate the two items into one. This oven and air fryer combo matches the new kitchen and combines the two functions quite well.There are a few things that I would suggest changing. I do wish I could turn the light on manually to see inside when the oven is not turned on. I'm not entirely happy with the plastic feel of the opening handle. I am concerned about it being more fragile than perhaps it should be. It is a little difficult to see the temperature and I'm unsure of what the symbols mean. Instead of symbols I wish that it could state what function you are selecting on the knob.I also wish that it had a small cooking sheet to use for heating simple items like a slice of pizza. And finally while I did not want a digital timer, this timer is sort of a guess and ots hard to set exactly how many minutes you are about to cook, so I keep an eye on the food when cooking so I don't overcook.So far I have used it as a toaster oven for reheating food and as an air fryer and I have been pleased with the function of both. It has a great nostalgic look that fits my kitchen very well.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve only had this a couple weeks, but so far, love this oven! Have made several meals using the air frying feature and everything came out delicious. Yes, it gets extremely hot, but not sure how this compares to other air fryers, as this is first I\u2019ve owned. My only dislikes are as previously mentioned, the plastic handles and pictures instead of words written on the knobs for the different options. I also wish it had the option of turning off the power with a button, rather than having to unplug it every time. If you leave it plugged in, the red power light stays on, even though it doesn\u2019t start cooking until you turn the dial to your chosen function and start the timer. There is no way of turning this red light off without actually pulling the plug, which seems odd. It is a beautiful and unique color, which looks perfect on my kitchen counter. Overall, I would recommend.",

It worked terribly food was always undercooked and not \"air fried\" with their preselected time and temperature settings. It is also beautiful and goes perfectly with my kitchen decor. My only suggestion is that plastic knobs be replaced with metal knobs. I am always very careful when I turn them because I am afraid they might break at thin part of the knob.",

Preheating takes mere minutes. The temperature is very accurate. Like a toaster oven, the elements are on a timer up to 60 minutes. Great for small jobs not requiring a full sized oven, but too small to replace a regular sized oven.",
