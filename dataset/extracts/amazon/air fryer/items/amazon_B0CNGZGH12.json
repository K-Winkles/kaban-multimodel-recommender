                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This air fryer was so light and easy to use. It doesn't have any variable for the temperature so you just use the dial to determine the time. It gives you suggestions on the top panel to help guide on time. The French fries I made were Crispy at 15 minutes, and fully cooked by 10 minutes. On my air fryer I have to adjust the temp and the time, and calibrate from there. This was just time and done.It's more of a cream color than white, so keep that in mind. It weighs nothing. When I picked up the box I thought I was going to get heft and it almost flew out of my hands. There are rose gold accents on the air fryer and all you need to do is plug it in, turn the dial, and let it go.The basket is deep. The coating on it made it easy to clean. I just wiped it clean. I like the rack at the bottom and that it's easily removed if I want to use it or not. If you wanted to make wings, this would ensure they were cooked without sitting in the grease and would be cooked all around.If you're just looking for something easy to use, just needing the time, this is a great deal. I'm actually giving this to my grandparents for Christmas because this is so easy to use and I think it will be perfect for them. I think we will make some game hens and see how those work in this, but I am confident.",
