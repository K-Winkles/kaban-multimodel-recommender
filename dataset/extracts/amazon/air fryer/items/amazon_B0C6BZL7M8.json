                "reviewText": "I also bough this at Costco. I am liking it and could see it being great for making/warming up pastries. So far I've tried making french fries while also having chicken cooking underneath - it was good only cooking meats on its own has better texture.. The one flaw I gave with it is that the grill sheet warps. It's not a a small thing too. it's like it comes a live of sorts making me feel very uncomfortable. It needs a mode. I need to find something similar but thicker that works. Otherwise it\u2019s good, good value. Don't expect much, be prepared to look for less frankensteinish grill sheet; you might also need to move it because it likes to set off fire alarm when opening the doors with all that hot air coming out. and of course everyone\u2019s favorite - cleaning. It\u2019s not bad since it\u2019s easy access, but it's not going to look new after any chicken frying attempt.. good thing there's vinegar and baking soda at the end of the year! Make sweets with it, bread and pizza or similar. It really is that kind of oven.02.02.2024\u2022 having grates above or below the grilling sheet makes it less prone to banding.\u2022 placing food right the way is good idea for anyone having fire alarm issues. There are presets that let you start without preheating which is something I am going to explore next. So far I was able to use regular presets by subtracting extra time it takes to warm up.\u2022 do not use this with another air frier while on the same circuit. Yesterday, I had circuit brake pop after having two air friers running at the same time. I was trying to get the oven away from setting off fire alarm, but that was a mistake. Best to place the food in the oven and not touch that door until it cools down.\u2022 I've been warming up croissants I got from local bakery. 3-4min, delicious!\u2022 this own is for pastries, pizza, anything breakfast.\u2022 Now that I've experienced it more, I find my other Corssori air frier less massy with meats. However, not as testy, but less effort cleaning. I think grilling meats outside is the way to go and having this oven for light baking is great.\u2022 what comes to mind here is bagels, toast, French, Italian and anything breakfast, Pizza, baking bread and sweets. This should be the mindset when buying. Otherwise all you going to appreciate is the French door.",
