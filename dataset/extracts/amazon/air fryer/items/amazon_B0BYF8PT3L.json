                "reviewText": "Not a lot of reviews on this one but almost all are 5 star with very positive comments. I was looking for a simple and reliable air fryer that didn't smell like burning plastic (like so many others). Before this unit I tried an instant vortex pro. It worked fine but the plastic smell was terrible and didn't go away after several washings and 10 hours of running the unit empty or with vinegar and water in it. Couldn't stand the smell so I returned it.A couple of reviews said no or minimal odor from the cuisinart air fryer so I gave it a shot. Washed it and ran 2 dry cycles for an hour each and 2 wet cycles with water and vinegar for an hour. A little smell at first but not as bad as the vortex. After the last prep cycle the smell was almost gone. I cooked a test batch of potato slices with a bit of olive oil. They crisped up to a perfect golden brown top and bottom in 15 minutes on airfry setting without even shaking them. I could not tell the top from bottom. Impressive.After that no plastic smell and surprisingly only minimal cooking smell. It washed up easily and has been amazing for roasting veggies and reheating leftovers. The controls are simple and easy to use and look classy, not flashy. It's also very quiet, you can barely hear it from 10 feet away. No pre-heat for airfryer setting (there is for bake/roast) and the basket slides in and out easily. The light only stays on for 10 seconds at a time but that's fine. The glass is easy to see through, though be careful because water can get on it if you spray the underside of the basket. The glass front gets hot while cooking but it's an oven, what do you expect? The sides don't get too hot and the air coming from the vent in the back is warm but not hot.This is definitely the one to buy - a little more pricey but absolutely worth it.",

                "reviewText": "I was on the fence, about buying this Cuisinart 6 QT Air Fryer, wondering if I would use it enough, to justify the price.Well, I am so glad that I purchased it! It has so many options with the pre-sets, but with enough versatility, for your own recipes.This Cuisinart 6 QT Air Fryer is larger than I thought it would be, and a bit heavier too. That's a good thing! This isn't a flimsy appliance! It being a Cuisinart product, I knew I would be getting a quality product! I also have a Cuisinart Convection Toaster Oven.The larger size, and all of the options, it makes this a much more versatile product. Since it's just me, it definitely has plenty of room, for whatever I want to cook.It does have a lot of beeps when you set something, and to me it's a bit loud with my excellent hearing, but that means I can hear it in my bedroom, when the timer goes off.Thanks to some wonderful reviews on Amazon for this product, particularly the person who said that you have to set the Time & Temp first, I didn't even need to read the product manual, before using it for the first time.This Cuisinart 6 QT Air Fryer comes with a non-stick cooking rack, to place in the Air Fryer Basket. I also bought a Box of 110 - 9\" Brown Square Parchment Liners, which makes clean up pretty non-existent. They fit this Air Fryer perfectly! I bought them on Amazon, plus a Set Of 2 Pull Out Mats - 12\" X 14\". They kind of look like a cutting board, but they are felt & silicone. Makes pulling the Air Fryer out from the wall to use it, then pushing it back effortless.The Product Manual is wonderful. Lots of recipes, and it comes with a 3 Year Limited Product Warranty, plus a registration sheet. Make sure to register your product. You can do it online.So far, I've made Spring Rolls, and Chicken Wings. Both came out excellent! I've only had it since yesterday.I can definitely see using this Cuisinart 6 QT Air Fryer, a lot more than my toaster oven, and microwave.It doesn't heat up my kitchen. I also feel safer using it, since it has a pull out drawer, level with my kitchen counter. I don't use oil when I cook, so for me using it is a healthier way to cook.I love the light on this Air Fryer, so you can choose to see your food while it's cooking. The light does not stay on. I also love the Keep Warm, & Toss Feature, so that whatever you are cooking comes out evenly cooked. I also love that it has no knobs.This is such a wonderful Air Fryer, whether you are just using it for yourself, or for a family.It looks so nice sitting out on your kitchen counter too.A wise, smart, wonderful purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using it constantly for 6 weeks. It cooks the best tasting bacon. I really like the way the bottom tray has rubber feet that hold it inside the basket. It allows you to dump the grease out between batches. The rubber feet holds the tray in so it doesn\u2019t fall out. It cooks chicken and the skin is crispy, I was using my outdoor gas grill for everything. Now I cook everything in the air fryer. It heats up to 450 degrees so it does a nice job at browning your meat. Bacon, sausage, hamburgers, chicken drumsticks, steak, shrimp. The only thing I use my gas grill for when it\u2019s not raining is steak. It\u2019s hard to beat the open flame flavor. But if you don\u2019t have a gas grill this works good for steak. The controls are very thought out and easy to use. I like the flip beeper that tells you when to flip your meat over. It comes with a useful cooking chart that gives you times and what settings to use for various things. It has a light inside so you can see your food cooking without opening the door. The whole thing is nonstick so its easy to clean up. Its also very quiet. If your cooking meat the 450 degrees is the way to go.",

                "reviewText": "I looked at other air fryers, and landed with the Cuisinart 6-Quart. It's dimensions fit well on a small counter space, it looks good compared to some others. I've tried several recipes, including chicken wings, air fried proteins, and myriad roasted vegetables. Quick, easy, and consistent! It's also a snap to clean.One small caveat, the viewing window provided in the basket is constructed in such a way that water can slip between front and interior material. This sometimes leaves water marks on the viewing window as I'm unable to manually dry it.",

                "reviewText": "Works great. I'm in love with air frying. Chops, steaks, fries all come out greatDon't really see much difference between the different modes, air fried bake, broil.More instructions would have been nice.Once in awhile the temperature and timing buttons don't respond.. Occasionally the fryer will shut down in the middle of a program. That worries me for possible future problems. Presets not near what normal cook times are for most foods",
