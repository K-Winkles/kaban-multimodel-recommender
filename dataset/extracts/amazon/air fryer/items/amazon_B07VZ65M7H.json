                "reviewText": "I only got my air fryer yesterday and already raving about it. I hadn't got one sooner as I don't eat a lot of fried food. But then I found out you can roast, bake, etc in it so decided to try one out. I went with the AmazonBasics one as 1) It was less expensive than others of equivalent size, 2) I have purchased several other AmazonBasics items and all have been great and 3) For the most part the reviews were great.PROS:- While I thought it seemed a bit large when I unpacked it since all the controls and the basket are on the front you can have it on a countertop under cabinets.- Basket is LARGE! You could cook a lot in there! You can also cook an entire meal by adding items that take less time to cook later on.- So easy to use. Just set your temp and time and press start.- You can remove the basket without turning it off first to check progress. Then it continues where you left off once you put it back in.- Automatically shuts off when done.- Excess power cord tucks inside back of fryer keeping it neat.- So far everything I've cooked has come out perfect. I was especially surprised at how absolutely perfect and evenly cooked chicken thighs were which were the very first thing I cooked. AMAZING! Best thighs I've ever cooked and this was my FIRST TIME cooking them!!!- Clean up is super simple. Just remove the basket and drip pan, separate and wash in the sink. Both cleaned really easily. Such a difference from if I made these items in the stove or oven.CONS:- I don't like the placement of the power button. It's where \"ON\" is on most microwaves including my own. So twice now I've set the temp, set the time and then shut it off. So that means having to go back through the temp, time setting again.- \"Cooking Hints\" on top are in Celsius when the air fryer is in Fahrenheit. Even if you lived where they use Celsius you can't change the fryer to Celsius so this makes NO sense. What a waste. At least it's under my cabinets so I don't see it!- Temp only goes up in increments of 10. So you will have to adjust cooking times that call for 325, 375, etc.- I find it odd that it doesn't save the last temp that you used when you turn it back on. It's always 360 degrees which also a temp you would likely never use - so why not 350 which so many items are cooked at?Since none of the Cons affect the quality of how food will turn out I still give this fryer 5 stars. Hopefully they'll change the Celsius cooking tips though because that is just so pointless!Pictures:- showing how it fits nicely under cabinets- Blasted Broccoli - took about 7 minutes at 350- Roasted beets and pattypan squash - 15 minutes at 350- Chicken thighs - 40 minutes at 350 (would have only been 300 at 400 but I was cooking the veggies at the same time)- Home friends - 15 minutes at 390- button placement on the control panel- the weird \"Cooking Tips\" in Celsius - WHYYYYY?Edit: since I posted this review I've made twice baked (well really twice air fried) potatoes, brats, a frittata, a Cornish game hen and brownies - all perfect! Get one of the air fryer accessory kits with the pans and racks they are awesome and pretty inexpensive. They also most often come with parchment liners.",

This one came up on Prime Day.First let me say it is huge compared to my original fryer. Won't fit in the kitchen cabinet. (Don't like appliances on the counter). It must be sat on a heat proof surface to empty it as it's too heavy/awkward to hold in your hand while emptying.It does cook well and I've had great success with the foods I'd normally air fry.Cleans up easily handwashing.The beeps when it shuts off are not super loud which is a plus in my mind.Others have mentioned the Celsius vs Farenheit indicators. I'd never noticed that and it doesn't impact my experience.Although it is quite large, it isn't at all heavy.Also no smell of chemicals, plastic etc.Overall, very happy.",

In our experience, the \"Amazon Choice\" products takes a lot of the guess work out of shopping. This is a great unit at a great price. Still learning how to use it, but understand that is with everything.",

I cannot express in words how much money has been saved from not having to go out and buy fast food on those lazy dinner nights.It makes little sense as to how I get the same fast food quality crisp from chicken tenders or beer battered fish and chips with frozen food from the grocery store.My next adventure with the air fryer will be to hand prepare foods instead of buying frozen from the grocery store.If you want to know if this item is worth it- yes. Yes it is. My mother, the private chef was the most reluctant until I forced her to try it. Now her brain is going to see what masterpieces she can create. Very happy with this purchase!!!!!!!!!!!!",

                "reviewText": "I wondered what \"air fryer\" means. It turns out to be a convection broiler. It is pretty easy to clean and the controls are simple. The temperature is mostly meaningless. It starts at room temperature but does not indicate the inside temperature, only the setting. I run it on 400F because it is broiling, not frying or baking and I check and move things after about ten minutes. I use a probe thermometer to check on meat doneness. Hot dogs and sausages are really cooked well. Steaks and burgers require attention and should be turned over. The \"guide\" temperatures on the top are in C and the display is in F (and can't be changed to C). But if you run always at 400 F it's fine. And once you figure out the time you need (make a note) for anything, it becomes obvious. The inner basket gets very hot and the outer holder is also hot and when you pull the whole thing out it should go onto a surface that can take the heat. The digital aspect is fine. The indicators are for heat on/off and convection on/off. Since it has a pause/start as well as the heat stopping when you pull out the holder, make sure the heat indicator is on when it starts again - it tends to turn off. It's a good idea to take a look insider. There is a large heating element at the top, as in a broiler, the basket, like a fryer, and a fan. It works but is not completely obvious. Check that the small basket size is good enough for your plans. It fits two hot dogs well or two steaks.",
