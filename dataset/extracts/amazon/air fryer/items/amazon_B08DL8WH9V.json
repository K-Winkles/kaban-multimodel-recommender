It simply powered down while cooking and was never able to be powered on again. I think most people would agree that a kitchen appliance should last longer than 14 months. For the record, yes, it was properly taken care of, kept clean, and was not dropped or damaged in any way.I spoke with Chefman customer service, and they stated they will be sending a replacement air fryer at no additional cost. I am just as happy with the replacement as I was with the original. The company really came through with good customer service.",

                "reviewText": "Throw away the oven. I mean.... I haven't used it since I got this. I wish I could just have an oven-sized one of these placed in my house. It makes breakfast a breeze, goes up to 400, no preheat required. I think it has a normal bake setting, but I havent used it. My friends tasted a frozen burger that I had thrown in there, and wanted to know how I leveled up my cooking. Making an actually nice breakfast has been as easy as a microwave meal (I've been partial to breakfast burgers with egg and cheese on top). The dehydrator setting makes it so much easier and cheaper to feed my chip/dried fruit addiction. Did you know that if you cut up mangoes too thin, they become crispy like chips?!Heres the cons, theyre not big:1. I wish there was a better mechanism for the door. Not sure what the new model loks like. But this one is very heavy, hard to pull the latch, and has no control over how fast or hard it drops. Just take care opening/closing it and you should be fine. I havent had mine for more than a couple months, and I see reviews stating the door breaks easily. So maybe something to consider.2. There is no airfry bucket. Its all grated metal shelves. I partly bought this to avoid plastic pieces inside the machine, and I don't regret that. However, there are some recipes that become more complicated. Fries and other recipes have to be mindfully turned rather than just shaken up like some other air fryers. A little time consuming. I have also tried to make eggs in several different ways and realized that it is much harder with this model because there is nothing to really set the egg on. Parchment paper just flies up to, so I think I'll have to get some special parchment covers for the shelves. They get messy and are not so easy to clean. I do wish there was a shelf that had a solid base for things like this, or even a small bowl insert. Some recipes just require some adjustment because its built a little different.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted an air fryer but I saw this multipurpose oven/air fryer and was a skeptic. Since putting it on my counter I use it every day. It's just perfect! As a single person household I hate using a standard oven for small meals for myself. This heats quickly, has individual controls for time and temperature and a see through window and light to see how your food is doing. The oven is small enough for quick and easy use, but large enough for two racks and fits quite a lot of items. I have not used the rotisserie feature yet - and may never use it, we'll see.Pros: Multiple uses, time and temperature control, oven light and clear window on door, door comes off for easy cleaning. Wire racks and catch plate ford drippings are very easy to clean, high powered.Cons: The dehydrated timings are off - its too long. It tends to dry out the food too far so you have to watch the temperatures and timings carefully. Otherwise works great.",

                "reviewText": "So off the bat- this thing is much lighter and takes up less space than my Cuisinart toaster oven/air fryer.The Chefman has 3 racks which is a big factor in why I chose this. However. Racks are flimsy and made of a mesh metal like the vent cover on your range hood for your stove. They do not slide in easily. So you risk pushing too hard and spilling the food into the bottom of the air fryer. It is frustrating and time consuming to put the racks in but you have to pull them out to put the food on really.Cleaning them with anything that is saucy or drips will be a pain I can tell. Like I said they\u2019re meshy so they will bend and wear out I\u2019m sure.Then the door. You have to hold the top of the air fryer to push the door shut or open it. It is not spring loaded. And it has to like \u201cclick.\u201d The door feels heavier than the whole air fryer itself.It almost feels like a toy. An Easy bake oven.It cooked the first food well. I love the touch/digital settings.It has presets so you can push one button and go which can be handy if you\u2019re cooking the same foods often.So far that\u2019s my review. I\u2019ll add more as I go if I find things. I have only had it a day and used it a handful of times.EDITING after using it for a few weeks.Three racks does not mean faster cooking of more volume of food. Whatever is on the middle of bottom rack will not cook as fast or barely at all of the top rack has food.There is not an even distribution of heat. I understand more food means maybe longer cooking times but in an oven you can cook two racks of food and they are both cooking at the same rate - generally.If I\u2019m cooking nuggies and fries\u2014This air fryer runs VERY loud. When it\u2019s off you realize how loud it is .The touch buttons I said were nice but there\u2019s no feedback or haptic so you know the button is responding until maybe you push too many times lolAgain these are just things I\u2019m finding that I will consider with my next purchase.I would not recommend this air fryer unless you don\u2019t have expectations or use it often.",

                "reviewText": "This has been fun to learn to use. We had a small air fryer and decided we need something bigger. This doesn't take up much more room than the small one. No preheat setting, I'm not sure if that is good or not. We have experimented with several different foods, cauliflower, frozen potato puffs, frozen french fries, frozen taquitos and tacos. It reheats well, I reheated P.F. Chang fried green beans and they came out nice and crispy. I like that there are 3 trays, which gives more room to cook more food.",
