                "reviewText": "It\u2019s perfect for making single serving meals and appetizers for two. It cooks evenly and I have just taken frozen fries, frozen tater tots, frozen buffalo chicken wyngz, and frozen mozzarella sticks, so far into the fryer. Straight from packaging to cooking and it\u2019s easy. I usually cut the full cooking time in half and when it dings, I turn the items over. With fries, I shake them and \u201cstir them\u201d with tongs about 3 times during the cooking process. Everything turned out great. My guest was impressed with the mozzarella sticks in particular because they were perfect and without the grease.Cleanup is easy!It\u2019s non-stick, if you didn\u2019t read the description, and you just need to shake out crumbs before wiping with a soft sponge with soap and water. They recommend wiping the heating element off if grease or food gets stuck to it. The fan sits above the food, and the fan pushes the heat down to the food. So it\u2019s not going to get dirty often unless someone overloads the basket. I keep it to one layer of chicken or mozzarella sticks, but fries take up more room.It\u2019s fairly quiet, and certainly not noisy. You just hear the whole of the fan. It gets to peak heat within minutes and it has to be cheaper than heating a whole oven for one person to eat a meal or snack. I hate using the oven for something like fries or tater tots. It\u2019s a waste of energy ($$$) for something so simple.One tip is to preheat the unit by running it for about 3 minutes before you put food in to cook. This way the energy used during cooking will go directly to your food rather than not be able to gauge how well the food is cooking. You\u2019d have to preheat your oven for 5 minutes and it\u2019s a much bigger use of energy.Those photos were not taken for this review. I just happened to have a few I took to send to someone when I was cooking dinner with it. So that\u2019s from my first go-round.If you are cooking for more than one, then get something bigger, but if you\u2019re cooking for yourself, then this will help you out nicely.",

I thought the Dash would be cute but probably not super functional. I was WRONG on the second count. It is cute and it\u2019s not huge - to be clear, I would say it\u2019s best suited for one person portions. But, it is extremely easy to use, the color is nice (gray), it\u2019s not particularly loud especially compared to other air fryers, it\u2019s got the versatility and function of full sized air fryers, is easy to clean, and the size is manageable if you want to leave it on the counter. I wish I had bought it sooner.",

                "reviewText": "I've had the Dash Compact Air Fryer for nearly 6 months, and I love it. It's small and prefect for 1-2 people. Great quick toaster oven that creates health crispy food with little or no oil. It works by circulating air over the top of the food, so you need to flip over or toss the food.PROS: It's perfectly cooks food that comes in smaller pieces (french fries) or meat that cooks up quickly (beef, shrimp, salmon). Oven Fried Chicken: I could never get my oven fried chicken to get crispy like a oil deep fryer. After baking it in the oven, I would quickly air fry for 5 minutes to give in a crispy skin and coating. Frozen Fries: Works well with most types of frozen french fries, but Shoe String Fries are the best for air frying due to their thin cut.CONS:1. The Non-Stick Coating. A lot of comments complain about the non-stick coating flaking off. Many modern cooking appliances have cheap non-stick coating, and this is no exception. I used to have a Foreman grill that had the same problem. I learned through past experience to use parchment paper under my food to prevent the food from sticking and the flaking of the non-stick coating. PRO-TIP: For the Dash Compact Air Fryer, I used the removable circular tray to trace and cut out perfect parchment paper liners (see pictures). It makes clean up super easy and preserves the coating on the cooking surface. I added a picture of my air fryer tray after 6 months of regular use (looks like new). It takes about a minute to cut the parchment paper to size, and I usually pre-cut a dozen ahead of time. Don't pre-heat the air-fryer with parchment paper inside because it will be blown up into the heating element and burn the paper. Make sure the parchment paper is weighed down by food.2. The Spring-loaded Timer. The manual timer is spring loaded and requires sufficient tension to be accurate. If you set the timer for less than 5 minutes, it will turn off before the 5 minutes. I'm not certain if this is a design flaw or just my machine (your mileage may vary). I wouldn't recommend cooking anything for less the 5 minutes. Most food requires more than 5 minutes, so this shouldn't be a huge problem.3. Thick food. This is not just a problem for this brand or model. All air fryers operate by pushing hot air over the surface of the food. So, thinner slices of food work better. I wouldn't cook a thick cut of steak in it (unless you like it blue) or thick cuts of pork/chicken. As I mentioned above, I would bake thicker pieces of meat in the oven and crisp the outside in the air fryer. For food cut into small pieces (like fries), lay them on the tray in a single thin layer. Don't fill the basket to top.Despite the few drawbacks, I love the Dash Compact Air Fryer. It doesn't do everything, but it's great at one thing: making things crispy. I use it for baked salmon, crisp up baked fried chicken, cook frozen fries, burgers, bratwurst, etc. It permanently replaced my toaster oven, and its thinner footprint means I save counter space.PS: If you have leftover fried food, try re-heating it in the air fryer. It will make it crispy again.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my dad because he had expressed interest in borrowing mine. I really like that this is a small unit, just right for basically one person/one serving. It is analog, so no fancy push buttons, just a time dial and a temperature dial. Set it to the temperature you need, turn the timer on, and when the light turns green, the unit is at the proper pre-heat temperature. The basket pieces are all dishwasher safe (I hate washing dishes) and the unit is very easy to clean. Highly recommend for someone that doesn't need to air fry large quantities of food.",

The size is compact and fits well on my kitchen counter and the red color is amazing. Everything I have made from fries, to pizza, crispy beef, turkey thighs, pork tenderloin and cauliflower bites has been easy to do and turned out delicious. The size is definitely for one person and you can not do very big portions in it. So if you are hoping to make multiple things in it at once this is not the size for you. At this point it's a good size for me. I'm so glad I purchased it and there are wonderful groups on Facebook to help with recipes and ideas.",
