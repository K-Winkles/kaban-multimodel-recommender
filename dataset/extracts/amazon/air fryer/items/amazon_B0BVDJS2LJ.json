Doesn't match my refer which is a mercury color, but this is plain black, but still looks nice. Nice presets, unlike my last unit which all were set at 400 or 450. Everything so far has turned out perfectly. Toast was just right, huge baked potato baked at only 45 min. at 350 which surprised me. My clam strips were great. Very quiet! That was a relief.Tentative: The temp go up at 25 degrees intervals. Should be at 5 or 10 degrees. Unit lights up well but I was worried that lights would stay on. After 10 minutes or so they all go out except for the Start button. Nothing about this was mentioned in the manual, that I saw. So it's fine but wish they would have mentioned it in the manual. Other than these two things, everything is great and I'd buy it again. Last thing to review will be how long it lasts.",

                "reviewText": "Fryer looks good, it's stainless steel on the outside, galvanized steel on the inside. It keeps steady, accurate temperature, -15,+5F from what it is set to (measured with digital meat thermometer). It truly can heat up to 450F. While cooking, front and rear get scolding hot, sides and top get warm to touch, handle is cool.All controls on the digital panel are directly select-able, unlike some where one has to flip through options. I would have preferred that temperature and time are displayed next to each other rather than display alternating between time and temperature. At least the numbers are twice as big as usual so they are easy to see from afar. Temperature and/or time can be adjusted during cooking.Unit can barely fit 12\" pizza. I have not tried it but there's an indentation in the rear to accommodate a round 12\" pie. Just barely though, so it's questionable how well it would cook it. Basket dimensions are 11.5x10\". Inside oven dimensions are 12Wx10Dx5H(height from drip pan to heating element).EDIT: dehydrate on 135F setting for 7 hours used 1.5kWh of energy.Even though I have not used it for long, I noticed following shortcomings:- rear is entirely uninsulated, thin single sheet of metal, so it'll have temperature is close to inside- light bulb appears to be impossible to replace- some reviewers have shown picture of burned seal and I believe it's possible with drip pan in lowest position- I saw a picture of rusted crumb tray in one review. Considering that it's a flimsy piece of zinc plated steel I think that's quite possible if cooking salty food that drips and is not cleaned quickly.- I quite dislike when display alternates between temperature and time - even when not in use.- oven lamp does not turn on when door is opened- there is no pause button. Manual tells you to open the door to pause cooking.And, here are positives that I did not mention:- fan is not as loud as other air fryers I tried- the beep sound is not loud and oven does not beep on every key press, plus sound can be completely turned off- touch controls are easy to use and have good sensitivity- cooking pauses when door is open",

                "reviewText": "This oven has lots of functions and is very easy to program because it is digital. I also love the led light inside. I live alone so I hardly ever actually cook, so I bought this oven with hopes I would cook for myself. I bought a nice steak and decided to use the air broil function. This oven cooked that steak to perfection, even telling me when to turn it. I just wish it was a bit smaller as it takes up a lot of room.I look forward to cooking more often.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

The central knob had the controls built into it and the settings would not work unless we pried it with a knife !This unit is completely digital and it has worked very well so far also it was almost half the price of the Cuisinart but much better IMHO. I will be cak to update if necessary. 12/7/2023",

                "reviewText": "I love this oven! It takes all the guess out of how long to cook something. I used to overcook chicken until it was dry and tasteless, but this oven doesn\u2019t let me. Every time I cook chicken, I just hit one button and the oven does the rest - comes out fabulous every time. I have also used the oven to roast vegetables, cook salmon, bake cookies and even make pumpkin bread. This oven bakes them perfectly. The time and temp are easily changed if you need. I haven\u2019t tried all the features, but I love what I have tried. Definitely worth the price!",
