                "reviewText": "I wanted to wait awhile before I gave my review of the Chefman Air Fryer. I have it now one month and am enjoying it quite a bit. Lots of use! My adult daughter is staying temporarily and loving it as well. We are the main users. I love that it's roomy and QUIET! LOL The basket interior is quite roomy for at least a FIVE POUND Whole Chicken! Spacious enough for a tasty 5-6 lb Beef or Pork Roast. You can place about 10-12 whole wings in there at a time. Grilled Cheese, etc, etc. To go with this Fryer, I would suggest and recommend the \"Elctbras 4 Pack Air Fryer Silicone Liners Reusable Round Insert, Food Grade Silicone Liners for AirFryers up to 8 quart.\" - they also can be used in microwave. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND these as they come in very handy to place in your Air Fryer and help keep it a bit cleaner, longer. For instance, with these Silicone liners, they are placed right in your fryer. You can place fries, whole potatoes, cut bagels/English muffins, and all sorts of foods. They are round, absolutely reusable to and hand and machine washable). They dry very fast then ready to use again. THEY CONE IN A SET OF FOUR for around $20.00, maybe a bit less depending when purchased. Of course you can use your Air Fryer as well without the liners whenever you desire; they are just a little helpful addition. If you're toasting/Air frying your bagel, muffin, etc. in the fryer, I place it in the Silicone liner. Only a few crumbs remain and get shaken clean till next time. If Air frying a meal of sorts, you can place directly in your Non-stick air fryer as well. Cook as desired. The basket is very easy to clean. You can hand wash in very warm to hot water with a liquid detergent like Dawn. If need be, lightly brush with a dish brush, then rinse and drip dry. A quick wipe and place back in the unit. Or place in your dishwasher. Rest of Air Fryer gets a wipe with soft cloth. Overall,I definitely recommend this very attractive and quite impressive Air Fryer!",

So I did read alot on the varieties of fryers before chosing. Just received this Chefman 8 qt air fryer. Cranked it up and put in some chicken wings. They were so good. Perfect. Clean up was super easy. Let it completely cool. Stuck the grate in soapy water. Used a paper towel to wipe out what grease there was and put in soapy water - poof. Easy. I am excited about this fryer and really looking forward to eating healthier with less hassel. Everything about this unit is easy - easy to use, easy to clean and nice and a nice big basket. Very happy - thank you.",

( of course after wiping n cleaning it first) I made wings and they came out crisp n cooked all the way n a lil extra lol. It definitely cooks quick I'll te you that. N I followed the amount that the Manuel left but next time ima use a lesser amount. But this air fryer works great.",

I am glad that we got the run around for the replacement because we gave up on them and purchased this one. I am very happy with this product. It does everything it claims to do. It is very easy to run, and I have had no trouble understanding the directions for it's use. After you cool the pans down (for Teflon linings a must), it cleans like a dream. I purchased the 8 qt. size and am so happy for the extra space to cook with. My hubby loves it for heating up left over pizza. It comes out nice and crispy on the bottom just like fresh baked.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been hearing all about the buzz on how wonderful air fryers are\u2014healthy, convenient and cooks almost anything you\u2019d place in an oven.I did a lot of research and wanted to make sure my first air fryer didn\u2019t contain Teflon or those forever chemicals. Articles I read mentioned that Chefman\u2019s do not. I didn\u2019t need something too big yet I didn\u2019t want a tiny one.This air fryer at 5 quarts is perfect. Anything breaded turns out crispy and delicious. Zucchini fries (or even potato) are addictive. Glazed wings\u2014-delicious.Easy to clean and the basket for cooking is large.So why not 5 stars? My device\u2019s tray came damaged. The hinge to pick it up was missing. I spoke to Chefman support several times and I\u2019m still on the waitlist for a part replacement. I bought it back in July and they would have gladly replaced it but it meant returning this product to UPS and although not heavy, it\u2019s also not light. I can still use the device by lifting the tray with a fork or knife but it\u2019s just the principle and somewhat clumsy.I am still hoping to receive the replacement for the tray\u2014otherwise it just works so wonderfully. I love food cooked in this air fryer.It\u2019s as though the food is transported to a restaurant and comes back so delicious. It\u2019s like magic and cooking time is quick.User friendly too.Recommend.",

I bought this one because of the great reviews and I'm just going to add to it. This thing is so quiet! We were shocked. We had to keep checking that it was running Because of how quiet it is. Amazing! Also, with his limited vision, he needs very bright displays and this display is very bright and works great for him. I thought I'd mention that in case anyone else has limited vision. My father loves the basket size and the sleek design. I am looking to buy myself one now. Love it.",

The amount of time I save tossing in vegetables and tofu to crisp up while I do other things in the kitchen makes my life so much easier.",
