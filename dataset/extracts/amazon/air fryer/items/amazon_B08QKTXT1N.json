                "reviewText": "Not sure what to say. I have a very expensive toaster oven air fryer from Breville which just struggles to toast or air fry. And after you do it splatters all over the inside and it's difficult to clean. It's more like cleaning an oven. I bought this ninja from Amazon warehouse with pretty low expectations. It's simple and simply amazing. It browns food in under 5 minutes compared to 15 to 20 min for the Breville. Because it works so quickly food doesn't dry out like it does in the Breville. The ninja reheats food in minutes. Not sure how this is possible because the Breville is rated to 465F and this ninja only goes to 400F!Since there are no direct heating elements, I can use a wax paper liner in the basket which makes cleaning even simpler. Using a liner other than foil is simply out of the question for the breville, you'd burn the house down. The entire ninja basket is non stick and dishwasher safe too and can be wiped and cleaned quickly with a damp sponge. Only problem is what other appliances I'm going to have to retire to make space for this ninja.",

I FOUND THE AIR FLYER COOKS QUICKER THAN THE RECOMMENDED COOKING TIMES. I HIGH RECOMMEND THIS AIR FRYER. IT IS BETTER THAN THE PHILLIPS AIR FRYER AT LESS THAN 1/2 OF THE COST.",

                "reviewText": "A friend had one of these and sad she uses it every day so I got one and was excited to use it.First thing I noticed is while it is an amazing device it just seems too small for some things. Some bloggers said they bought one this size but then got a bigger one, and I see the square ones in lots of pics on Pinterest! the fact is you can fit more in a square shaped air fryer, and that is what I need apparently.We cooked two steaks in this and each end was closer to the sides and cooked more than the middles.I like making buttered toast in this! But the bread is so light the air fryer mode blows the pieces upside down so I got a wire rack and let the handles lay across the toast to keep the butter side up! It makes the best toast.As for French fried potatoes and sweet potatoes, it is ok but I like them in baked in the oven better.This is great for reheating pizza for sure!I am just not as crazy about this because, as I said, I find the round shape a bit limiting but it is a wonderful product, easy to clean and has some great features. We are thinking of using this one and getting a square shape air fryer, too, then we can cook some things in this one while cooking other things in the square one.",

                "reviewText": "I have had the Ninja Foodi flip-up toaster oven for several years now. It has an air fry function, and I always thought that was good enough. I cook many things in it, but most of the time, it seems to dry out the food. So, when this air fryer went on sale for Black Friday, I jumped on it. WHY didn't I buy one of these sooner?! This thing is truly amazing. I have had it for about a month and have cooked almost all of my meals in it since. Breakfast sausage, chicken thighs/breasts, eggs, potatoes/fries, you name it, this thing can cook it. It's easy to clean, too. There's not much else to say. Try it out!",
