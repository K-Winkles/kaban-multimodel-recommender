                "reviewText": "I have to say\u2026 I purchased this primarily as a small oven\u2026 For toasting, reheating, convenience. But I was stunned at how amazing the air fryer function works. We\u2019ve been using now for air fried recipes. Crispy french fries, homemade chicken nuggets, even chicken wings! I have an air fryer that\u2019s really big and uses a lot of countertop space, I\u2019m happy that this air fry oven does the work of two appliances. Plus it cleans up much easier! Were using it all the time. If it\u2019s quickly, super easy to use, and I love that it\u2019s worry-free free nonstick. It comes with a great nonstick pan that has a Ceramic Nonstick surface\u2026 and a nonstick air fry basket as well! All this and a great price! Highly recommend!",

I was pretty excited to use it, until I noticed a dent on its side as soon as I opened the box. I gave the over I try and was pleased with it, but I couldn't get over the dent it had on its right side, so I decided not to keep it. The return process was a breeze and the dent must've been a delivery thing, so sad because the oven is super cute, practical and it works as it should. Apart from the dent issue I had, I'd say the oven is a keeper! \ud83d\udc4d",

The non-stick bottom pan and baking tray is a must after having suffered from other ovens that is a chore to clean up...this just easily wipes clean! Compact design means you don't lose precious kitchen counter space, but has excellent volume to accomodate food from its height and depth. And very easy to use...just two dials to get your settings correct. Very fast and efficient...toasts and bakes in great time! Nice black finish is a great match with my black stainless steel appliances.",
