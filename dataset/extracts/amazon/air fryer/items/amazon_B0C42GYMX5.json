It has options for toast, bake, broil, air fry, etc. and they each perform quite well once you figure out how to configure it.- I use toast for breakfast sandwiches, garlic bread, and bagels.- Bake I have used to reverse sear a steak (I left it in too long lol) and to make some chicken wings- Air fry I use for everything I normally cook in my old air fryer, but it has a much higher capacity and the ability to cook things that require different temps by using the different racks- I use broil to melt cheese and put a nice color on top of pizzaIt has a wide variety of uses and for the price is absolutely worth buying. It just takes a bit to figure out how to use it.",

It has everything I was looking for: It doesn\u2019t just air fry- it bakes, broils, etc. The door is see through which means I can check on the food without opening the air fryer. Lastly, the control knobs are easy to understand, not too tech-y. Which is great because my mom is not too keen with digital panels. This is my early Christmas present to my family, and myself :)I might update my review after using it to see if it\u2019s worth a 5 star review.",

I like that the controls are easy to see and use..I shopped hard for a compact counter top oven high enough to have two optional cooking levels. The footprint on this is smaller than the one we replaced. I am happy.",

Everything I tried to toast or bake was burnt on the bottom and not done on the top. The air fryer seemed to be okay but it was very loud. I replaced with a Cuisinart and its great.",

I was happy with my purchase.2 months of having it, I was going to broil salmon for dinner. Noticed it wasn't broiling. The upper heating elements were not working. Not sure if they ever have. I've never seen them red. I've seen the bottom elements red hot. On broil, they for sure should not be black. Unfortunately it's passed the 30 days to return. :(",

Thank you for standing by your warranty, Geek Chef!Edited 11/8/23: GC has responded to my emails and is reportedly sending me a new machine! Will update again when the product arrives.I purchased this product in May 2023 and initially loved it! It\u2019s just the right size for my young family and heats/cooks everything incredibly fast, however, it recently started smelling strongly of burning plastic, so much so that I am not able to use it. I contacted Geek Chef and they requested I comment on my Amazon purchase in order for them to honor their 1 year manufactures warranty. I will update if/when they (HOPEFULLY!) make this right because I have loved their product up until this point. Hoping to hear back from you, Geek Chef!",
