Lots of buttons, so it looked confusing, but a couple of minutes with the user manual, it became child's play. I've cooked a frozen pizza and some chicken strips. This thing is powerful. The air fry function really works well. It cooked the chicken in half the time at a lower heat setting than using the regular bake function. The food came out great. I am happy for now. I can't attest to durability or longevity yet, of course. If it malfunctions or breaks in less than 4 years, I will be disappointed. I replaced my Oster oven with this one. I had the Oster for 6 years and going on strong, but it was old and full of hard-to-clean stains.",

                "reviewText": "I've owned this oven for about 2-3 months. So far it's been very good and it does pretty much everything that I want it to do. It's even better than the Breville Oven that I owned.Here are the Pros:1. It heats up very fast for a desktop electric oven. It's the fastest oven that I ever owned.2. Temperature prob can see current temperature and set what temp you want to stop at. You just set and do your things. This function is very useful and convenient such that it takes away the guessing and it will turn off at the exact temp you set at 1 deg increments. It roast perfect tri-tip as shown in picture. I set it at 137f.3. Can program multiple temp and cook time in sequence, ie. 450f for 5m then 375f for 20m. .4. Clock is defaulted to off, don't have to keep changing the time whenever you have an outage.5. Nice big size.6. Comes with 2 racks, metal basket and roasting rack&pan.7. Very reasonable price.8. Preheating function will beep when desired temperature is reached. It's defaulted on but I turned it off but can turn it on manually each time.9. There are more functions than you can imagine like being able to set different outputs(in %) in both the top vs the bottom heating element. So, it's great for professional chefs.There are many YouTube videos & websites teaching you how to use it.Con:1. You are even able to adjust the convection fan speed, too bad the button is a shared function with WARM function and is cumbersome to use.2. There is an oil burning smell that has not completely gone away after 3 months.Overall, this is the best oven that I've owned so far; I rate this oven a 5!",

                "reviewText": "First off, I don't get all the reviews that claim it's difficult to understand or operate; it is not at all. No, it's not a single button microwave where you just keep adding 30 seconds on high until it's done. It also makes way, way, way better food, so it takes a bit more effort. But it really is quite easy. Plus, I don't get all the \"turn off preheat\" comments. Works fine for me. It blinks when it's preheating, and the fan is on - how is it so hard to see that it's operating? Not hard at all. And after preheat, it counts down 10 seconds and starts cooking...again, pretty simple stuff. I was taken aback by all those comments prior to making the purchase, so I was focused on why it was such a weird thing for some people. Again, pretty straight forward for me.Secondly, the cooking times and programs are clearly estimates, everyone's preferences will need adjusting. All the cook times I tried needed more time, like another 30% more on average. Even when using the package instructions for the chicken fillet's I air-fried, it still needed 4 more minutes. The bacon I baked took another 3 minutes (this worked well using their \"low smoke thick bacon\" program/recipe in the booklet. I saw very little smoke, close to none).Lastly, taste - this is where it really matters, the taste is fantastic. It's the food and nothing else. The chicken was crispy outside and juicy inside. The bacon was packed with flavor. Better than the gas oven. Will be making some fries later today....can't wait!",

                "reviewText": "Contrary to comments that this oven is complicated, it's not. Every type of cooking has the same simple steps.1st, turn the unit on andpress the Menu button and all the functions light up on the display.2nd, turn the dial to select Air Fry, Bake, Toast, Reheat and many more. When you land on the one you want it blinks to show which one you are on.3rd, press start. ( which is also the dial)The dial, when you push it is the Start/Pause selector.It cooks so much better than my Emeril Lagasse Air Fryer Oven did.The toast setting works much faster, actually all the cooking features cook faster.It's much easier to clean than my former air fry oven was too. The inside surfaces are non-stick and wipe clean easily. I like that you can pull out the bottom where all the grease and droppings end up. I clean them off easily with soap and water at the sink. Sometimes not even soap. The inner oven walls wipe clean as well. I wipe it down when it cools as directed but while it's still slightly warm. I even wait until before I'm going to use it again which is generally 2 or 3 times a day or more.Don't overthink it. It's pretty basic unless you're going to use it as a professional chef might with all the other things it CAN do.Changing the time and temp is very easy too. Simply press the dial to pause, press the Time/Temp button, the temp will show first, turn the dial up or down to your preferred temp if you prefer a different temp than what is defaulted. Press it again to see the timer and turn the dial to change the time to more, or less time.The price is reasonable and the quality and safety exceeded my expectations from my previous experience with air fryer ovens.One more thing...I love that you can turn the oven off and have no lights on continuously. These days homes are full of all these lights, on appliances and electronics. Plus the oven light has a button to turn it on and off as you like. My old one would always come on for a minute and automatically shut off, annoying.",
