Starting in 2014, we noticed the disconnect in our lives and in the lives of those around us. We were so busy, always rushing forward, and our health and personal lives suffered. We needed to find some way to slow down and put our health first, all without sacrificing convenience or taste. Could we somehow create healthier versions of our favorite foods, easily in our own kitchens? The answer was a resounding yes, and NutriChef was born.",

                "reviewText": "I have always wanted a double oven but I will settle for a double air fryer. This is almost as good in my opinion since I use an air fryer so much, pretty much daily. The double baskets allow me to prepare everything that I want at once, whether warming pizza and garlic bread, fries and chicken tenders, etc. It\u2019s really fast and efficient at cooking and requires no preheating. This is a convenient option when I want to cook something quick, especially when I don\u2019t want to warm up the house with the oven when it\u2019s hot. I like how I can time things individually if one thing will take more time. It\u2019s just a great design. They thought of everything with this air fryer, from the height that allows it to fit under my top cabinets on my counter to the front facing controls so I don\u2019t have to slide it out to use. It\u2019s a really thoughtful and user friendly design. I like the crisper trays in the baskets that do double duty of letting air circulate better around food and also making it easier to clean. Overall I find cleanup easy since everything has a non-stick coating. The baskets are nicely sized for my needs and a good compromise on cooking space and overall footprint of the air fryer. I don\u2019t think it takes up too much space on my counter but if you have the cupboard space and want it put away, it will fit on a standard cupboard shelf. Overall, a nice air fryer and superior design for me compared to the large, single basket ones.",
