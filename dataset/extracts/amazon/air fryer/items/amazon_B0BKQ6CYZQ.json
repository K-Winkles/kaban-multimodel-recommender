Keeps the food elevated so that hot air circulates evenly. Easy to clean. Just pop it in the dishwasher. Even after cooking pork chops slathered in BBQ sauce, these came out sparkling clean.Only one minor complaint. If you use silicone liners for your cook drawers (and I highly recommend you do), note that this rack fits in VERY snugly, making it a bit hard to get out when it's hot. I have to use tongs to get it out. As I said, though, a minor complaint.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these for the air fryer hoping I could cook more in one pot each time - and I can. They do work great but there is some flaws. The racks do stack together but I found the heavier the food I'm cooking they did wobble/fall onto each other. It might be because the air fryer basket is bigger so there's more room for the baskets to shift. The other thing I noticed it that there actually isn't much space between each basket. So if you are cooking something that sticks up (e.g. chicken drummetts), they won't work. Chicken wings (wingetts) work well and bacon works well. FYI - bacon on the top basket will fly up during cooking. However, the cleaning up after is a bit awkward. Best to soak right away. I've done french toast sticks or bead and that works good. Overall, I do recommend these.",

                "reviewText": "I have the Ninja DZ401 and apparently no one makes parts that fit it - even Ninja doesn't have replacement crisper plates for it and the finish comes off of them. That's where these things come in handy. We use silicone paper inserts and 1 rack in each drawer every time we use it now. This helps with the cooking somewhat, at least crisping the bottom without having to flip it. I don't believe it cooks it more evenly or anything. Like them so much we just ordered another 6. Easiest way to clean them is just throw 'em in the dishwasher.",
