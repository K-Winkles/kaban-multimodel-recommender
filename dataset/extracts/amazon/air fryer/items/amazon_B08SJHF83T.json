Once the timer goes off, your food is ready and you will find it\u2019s crispy, juicy, and a whole lot healthier than anything cooked in a deep fryer. That\u2019s because, little to no oil is used, so there\u2019s fewer calories. Finally, it won\u2019t heat up your kitchen or leave a mess on your hands. In fact, our single basket is made with a ceramic non-stick coating, to make cleaning a breeze.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a late adopter to the air fryer phenomenon. Never had one or a confection oven before this. Being a late adopter to cooking tools stood me in good stead in skipping the Instapot, which I still think would have been redundant with the slow cooker. But my family probably would have been happy had I bought an air fryer sooner. After reading a zillion reviews, I went with this Paula Dean 10Q push button rather than the toaster oven style because I wanted something easy to clean and because our toaster oven is still working fine. I 100% agree with the reviews that this is easy to clean, which is, to me, its biggest advantage. Note that this is basically one big chamber with a removable metal tray or plate that is on legs that can be folded down. The main thing I learned from having this that I had not discovered from reviews is that the 10Q is not particularly functional. The reason the 10Q is superfluous is that the whole point of an air fryer is to maximize air circulation. This air fryer requires the metal plate to be below the food. So using the legs extended on the metal plate to allow air to circulate under the food is really how this is designed to be used. One could fold down the legs on the metal plate so it will rest on the bottom of the chamber, then pack food on top, but doing so will compromise air circulation. If you use the metal plate with the legs up, then you are limiting the amount you can cook to the 9x9\" surface area of the metal plate. That said, it so far seems to me that I might as well have gone with a 4Q or 5Q depth with the same 9x9\" surface area and saved myself some storage space in the unused height dimension. I might try using the metal plate on the floor of the chamber then packing in something like brussels sprouts or big pieces of cauliflower, so the shapes of the food will mean air can still circulate around the food, but I don't think I'll ever use the legs folded down for fish or chicken because putting food on the bottom means no air circulation from below, which will defeat the way the air fryer creates crispiness. My favorite thing so far has been brussels sprouts, followed by cauliflower: they come out substantially better than conventional roasting, though the recipes I have seen say to toss every 3 minutes for a 15 minute cook-cycle, and if I was willing to toss more often with roasting, despite the longer cook time, perhaps I could get closer. The crispy vegetables are the main benefit to the air fryer. So far, I prefer a broiler for chicken and fish, though I will try a few more times. Anyone who has said they cook their entire meal in an air fryer is probably cooking for a family of one or two (or perhaps using a toaster oven style, with which I have no experience): if you're only going to put the food on the plate with its legs up, to maximize air circulation, keep in mind that the 9x9\" is the meaningful dimension so that you won't realistically be able to do more than 2 pounds of fish or chicken at a time. I thought I wanted push buttons rather than a dial, but don't find them particularly useful (I always use the air fryer setting anyway, and when I've followed recipes, the other buttons seem to be below the recommended heat). The dark blue exterior has more of a greenish undertone than a purplish undertone.",
