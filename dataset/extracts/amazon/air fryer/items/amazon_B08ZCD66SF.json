                "reviewText": "I'm new to air fryers. What appealed to me about getting one was the concept of less oil but also that it functions like a small oven. I like that there is a drawer/basket you pull out instead of having to reach inside a hot oven. This makes it a safer choice for a child or elderly person.While new to air fryers, this is my second one. I started with a 5Qt Besile about 1-2 months ago. I used it a lot. My picky child loves the chicken pieces I cook in it. I'm totally sold on airfyers and would have been happy enough if that was all I had. But immediately decided I wished it were bigger and so when I saw the 7Qt Besile, I got it too. Things that are different between the 2 besides size: The drawer/basket in the 5Qt is vented on one side for air circulation and basket is round. The 7Qt instead has more space in the basket and no side vents and is square. The both have a flat rack insert instead of an inner basket. The rack holds the food up for air circulation.Lets talk about side vents -- you have to be careful when emptying the bottom of the fryer of drippings, that it doesn't poor out the vents.Cleaning of both baskets is easy. Cleaning of the rack is a little more work. Didn't come out clean in the diswasher after cooking several batches of chicken. Mainly you need to know that the rack has rubber/silicone/something feet that you will have to clean around and that these feet could break and I don't know how to replace them. This is my number one concern about this unit line.I'm not particularly impressed with the concept of shaking small foods to move it around for more even browning. I suggest you manually rearrange the basket and do not make it full, unless you don't care about crispying/browning.So far I have mostly cooked chicken. A whole chicken does fit in this. It also barely fit in the 5Qt but I wasn't happy with the evenness of cooking -- too tight of a fit for good air circulation, and coming really close to the top. Chicken pieces -- I suggest you do not double layer. Understand, I want my chicken skin crispy. You can get the pieces to done if it is stacked, but you cannot get them crispy. Because of this I really think a person cooking for a family at least needs a 7Qt. 5Qt for a single person.Cookbook & manual. The manual has reasonable size print, is readable. The cookbook is an electronic copy that you can get in your email box by request. I'm not impressed with the cookbook and will probably never hunt it down on my computer again. I need a cookbook that teaches you how to cook the basics in an air fryer. I'd like the cookbook/manual to have enough of a spine to survive use and stand up on a shelf. It doesn't need to be huge, but it needs to have the right basic information and be sturdy. The unit is intuitive enough that you can do a lot without a manual.I've cooked lots of good chicken in this and am happy to have it.A++ for air fryers. B for this application of an airfryer.",
