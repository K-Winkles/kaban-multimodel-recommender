                "reviewText": "This model, TOA-7 was purchased in April, 2023. I did lots of research on air fryers prior to purchasing this! Obviously, that didn't return the results I was hoping for. Since that time (now Jan, 2024) I mainly used it for baking a single chicken breast (375\u00b0), toast (takes forever) and occasionally the air fryer for fries, some frozen snacks. The convection oven for baking really cuts down cooking time. Now, suddenly the unit is smoking. White smoke fills the interior. I tried cleaning inside thinking it was grease from the chicken? Unit still smokes even when toasting. I called Cuisinart support since this was beyond my return window with Amazon and since this unit is still under warranty (3 yrs), they offered to send out a new unit. Customer service was extremely helpful. Not that I want this unit again, but at least I'm not out $160. I would advise to pass on this unit....",

                "reviewText": "I have wanted a toaster oven for years and had a mini air fryer that worked well but wasn't big enough to cook food for my whole family in, so I decided to buy this to replace it. This looks great, has good instructions, but the performance is lacking. I have tried all the settings and everything takes 2-3x longer to cook then instructions on the packages, and the ovens manual, says they should. The only setting the works like it should is \"toast\". I'm not sure if I got a bad batch but this was a waste of a lot of money and is now an expensive toaster sitting on my counter.",
