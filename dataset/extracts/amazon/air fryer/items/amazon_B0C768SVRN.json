Got this one on the Black Friday sale, and it is so much better than the one we had before.It is super easy to use! I wondered if we\u2019d really use the two zones, and we use them all the time.The other night my husband made a steak on one side and cauliflower and tots on the other\u2026.and they both got done at the same time. The steak was fantastic\u2014-and I don\u2019t mean for cooking it in an air fryer. It was excellent.Top: we put non-stick aluminum foil under our food which makes cleaning even easier.",

                "reviewText": "Not sure how, but somehow all these years hearing about air frying. And once you get one, you may never cook differently ever again.It\u2019s the new but actually health, microwave. Every house should have one, and although most regular stove/ovens incorporate it, it\u2019s not the same as something like this. We have both.This Ninja is the perfect size for 4 people. Things cook so fast, so even, so perfect, and always consistent, re discover food again. And, aside from some simple foot prep to preference, you do not have to do anything. Parts are dishwasher safe and easy to self clean too. Zero negative. The flex/time/zone thing is so awesome totally changed abilities. You can do a roast or main protein with a bed of anything, mixture of anything, perfect every time. Just buy it!!!!!",

                "reviewText": "I love my Ninja Air Fryer! It's the best kitchen appliance I've ever owned. I use it almost every day to cook everything from chicken and fish to vegetables and fries. It's so easy to use and the food always comes out perfectly cooked.I love that it has two separate baskets, so I can cook two different foods at the same time. This is perfect for busy weeknights when I don't have time to cook two separate meals. I can just throw everything in the air fryer and let it do its work.This is also very easy to clean. The baskets and crisper plates are all dishwasher safe, so cleanup is a breeze.Overall, I'm extremely happy with my air fryer. It's a versatile and convenient kitchen appliance that makes cooking easy and enjoyable. I also bought this to replace my six year old air fryer (that was also a Ninja) so I am confident that this will last me many years as well.",
