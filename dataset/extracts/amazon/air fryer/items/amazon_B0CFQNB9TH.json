We've only had it a short while, but everything we have made in it has come out wonderfully. We are experienced cooks in our own right - particularly my wife, who manages a kitchen for a living - but for the purpose of the review, we followed the booklet instructions for both French Fries and Chicken Wings exactly as printed. Both turned out wonderfully. The fries were golden brown, crispy outside and just-so inside. The wings were perfectly we cooked, and we very much loved the flavors of their recipe.We've also done air-fried chicken thighs in it to great effect - much like great deep fry, but without the oil.And although we had not anticipated it, the Fabuletta is ideal for re-heating leftovers. Gone is that kind of limp microwave sort of experience. In the air fryer, leftovers come out pretty dang amazing, gotta say.The shake reminder is a another great feature, helping you make sure your food crisps evenly. The machine does all the thinking (and reminding).After dinner is done, the parts are easy to clean and put away.However, we have mixed opinions about the control panel. My wife and I both feel it is not as intuitive as it could be, when we just walk up and turn it on. Yet at the same time, if you read the printed manual, it all seems perfectly obvious. Despite that, the next time we use it, we puzzle once again over the controls for a short while. That might be on us.But the food! This air fryer totally delivers. It is almost magical, how wonderfully everything turns out, and we have only started to explore its potential. And it is so compact! I so wish I'd had this when I lived in an apartment.[Full disclosure: As a reviewer, I did not pay for the unit. Also, I was not paid to write this review. I have no incentive and no reason, to state anything but my honest opinion. And so, I have.]",

                "reviewText": "I am not super knowledgeable when it comes to air fryers. I only owned one before getting this one (a DASH Tasti-Crisp 2.6 qt aqua one). My DASH one was smaller so when I saw this larger one with so many functions and a digital tempered glass display I had to order one.Aesthetically, it looks even better in person. I am a vegetarian so I can't tell how good it is for chicken or meat. But I've used it for potatoes and vegetables and it works excellently. The fries look and taste delicious when. Every time I want fries I keep using this air fryer.I appreciate that it is a 4 qt which I think is a perfect size as it is not too large or too small. One of my favorite things is all the settings that it has, you can either pick one of the default settings and you can also change the time and temperature for each of the settings. Another thing I like is that it has a pre-heat function and my favorite part is the shake alarm function, which beeps to remind you when to shake your food. It also beeps after it finishes.I will keep using this as time passes and I will update my review based on that. I have family members who eat meat, so I'll try to use it for meat and chicken.So far so good. I give this 5 stars. I highly recommend especially because of the price tag. I think every family that can afford an air fryer should have one because you are eating healthier (and delicious) if you use one and the Fabuletta 9 Cooking Functions Smart Air Fryer is a great option if you are looking for a good-quality air fryer.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve resisted getting an air fryer for several years even though friends and family frequently extolled the virtues of these devices. Recently, I finally relented and ordered this air fryer from Fabuletta. Am I glad I did? I\u2019m still not sure! The product design and operation is great but I still have some issues with how it cooks some foods.Let\u2019s look at the product first. It\u2019s a good size for two of us that will use it. 4 quarts is more than enough for us to cook good sized meals \u2013 we no longer have a big family so we don\u2019t need anything bigger. The style of the fryer is truly impressive \u2013 it looks Italian which matches the name (although it was manufactured in a country thousands of miles away). Operation is very easy: a time and temperature are selected and the fryer goes into action. There are some presets for different types of food but I think the operation is essentially the same for all of them. The user interface is a touch-sensitive glass plate. Not all the functions can be selected by touch so there\u2019s a bit of a learning curve here. I usually just choose the first option and tweak the settings accordingly. Halfway through the cook time, an alert is sounded for the tray of food to be shaken. A preset preheat function is provided but this operation seems to be the same as all the others (just a shorter time). A preheat operation is recommended for this fryer before adding any food. The basket is easily removed and replaced for adding food and shaking it up during the cooking cycle. A removable perforated tray sits at the bottom of the basket to help with hot air circulation below the food. Both the basket and the tray have a non-stick coating and can be cleaned in a dishwasher. The basket will also accept standard 8-inch square silicone trays which I\u2019ve used for foods with a bit of liquid \u2013 like a stir-fry. I found this air fryer to be very easy to use and it seemed to work well.Regarding the quality of the cooked food, I\u2019m still very much in the learning process. Some foods seem to cook very well \u2013 like meats and most vegetables. Some I\u2019m still struggling with \u2013 most notably potatoes. I am very disappointed at my attempts to make French fries \u2013 they either come out soft and soggy or rubbery and leathery. I haven\u2019t made a crispy chip yet! I\u2019ve tried different times and temperatures (sometimes more than one during the same cycle), different oils, different potatoes. I\u2019ve soaked them, dried them, boiled them, microwaved them, and frozen them before cooking but nothing comes anywhere near the quality I get from (two-step) deep frying. This is rather disappointing as people claim that this is one of the best things to cook in an air fryer. I feel that this is not the fault of this air fryer \u2013 I suspect that I will get similar results from any air fryer. Perhaps I\u2019m too much of a chip snob? However, I\u2019ll keep trying.In summary, this is an exquisitely designed product that seems to work well (apart from producing French fries that I would like). At the current price of less than $80, it seems to be a good bargain \u2013 especially with the 10% discount coupon also being offered.",

The price was right, the colour was funky, the design is great and the instructions and the use are so simple. Takes 15 minutes do do some sweet potato fries from fresh, with only a tea spoon of oil. Comes with a mini recipe book, which is very basic, but there is 100 of recipe on the internet. Did some roasted potatoes today, part boiled, then tossed with seasoning and a few table spoon of oil, honestly they were absolutely delicious, ok perhaps not the real one completely soaked and cooked in oil, but honestly if you are watching the calories, this was excellent and above all it does save mor3 than 60% of energy compared to the oven.",

                "reviewText": "I've been looking at at air fryer for some time. I'd never heard of this brand but the spec seemed to tick all the boxes so took a chance. It arrived well packaged.The unit is excellent build quality and looks good fitting into my kitchen decor nicely. It's easy to use via the touchscreen panel. A manual/recipe book is included. I've cooked all sorts in it including chips and potato wedges which come out really well. It's great for meat including steak and burgers cooking perfectly. Bacon is particularly good with just the right amount of crisp and without having the clean the fat out of the grill or smell the house out! It's not too noisy in operation either.Cleaning is as simple as placing in the drawer in the dishwasher but if you've used it a few times, you will need to soak and scrub like an oven tray as the dishwasher struggles a bit.This has been one of those items that you think you don't need but once used, you can't do without! Living on my own, this is just the right size and will save me a ton of energy and time in both pre-heating and longer cooking times in a 3kw oven. I would say this is only suitable for a 1-2 person household.Why not 5 stars? First the cord is comically short meaning you pretty much have to use it next to a plug socket as you can't have it too close to anything in operation. This is incredibly frustrating and limits placement. Even the manual makes reference to this. I had to go to the trouble of fitting a new socket under my worktop!Another issue is, if you are cooking something that isn't on the control panel, there doesn't seem to be a way to set time and temperature for a different type of item. As far as I can see, you have to select the closest item and then modify the temperate/time settings from that.Overall, a great air fryer, particularly if its your first one or you're a single household.",

It's the perfect size for one or two people and extremely easy to use. I cannot believe I didn't get one sooner. I followed the instructions and ran the machine with lemons the first time, before then cooking some fries. They were fluffy and delicious, with no weird smells or anything. It's also an absolute breeze to clean and the sage green looks so nice in my kitchen.Everything I've used it for has come out perfectly. It does come with pre-set modes, however I've found these sometimes vary from what the packet says. I tend to follow these instructions over the modes, and fortunately it's very easy to adjust them.There is a pre-heating function, which you can choose to switch off, however it seems logical to me to warm the machine up first for perfect results. This only takes about four minutes I think. Just don't forget that unless you've turned it off, the pre-heat will automatically run when you turn on the machine, so don't put your food in until it's done!I am really happy with my fabulous Fabuletta, highly recommended!",

There\u2019s a little plate that you put in the bottom of the basket and excess oil drips into it, my food turns out crispy and rarely greasy anymore. It takes almost no time to preheat so that\u2019s a massive bonus since my oven takes about 10 minutes.It\u2019s not nearly as noisy as I thought it\u2019d be, obviously it makes noise but not enough to scare my cats. I love that it beeps to remind you to shake the food or when it\u2019s done cooking, however I wish the beep was noisier or lasted longer since sometimes I don\u2019t hear it if I\u2019m in a different room.It looks sleek and doesn\u2019t take up much room. The inside is easy to clean and honestly I just get a paper towel and wipe the oil out because I can't be bothered to wash it. I eat large portions and haven\u2019t had an issue with it being too small therefore I think it could easily cook for a second person.",
