                "reviewText": "Dual temperature air fryer oven in one appliance is a neat concept but I have issues with this oven design.The upper oven is slightly bigger than the bottom oven but it is still too small for its overall size.What they should have done is to make the upper oven bigger and make the lower oven smaller.It would eliminate some of the current problems with this set up.On the upper part, the heating elements are infrared quartz elements while the bottom is moreconventional steel element. Upper part has heating elements on top and bottom of the oven,similar to a regular oven, while the bottom part has the heating element only on the top like mostbasket type air fryers. The main problem with this air fryer is that on the upper oven, no matter whatsetting is chosen, both upper and lower elements get turned on. And because the space inside the ovenis fairly confined, the heating elements can be too close to food being heated. In a regular oven, whenbake setting is selected, only the lower heating element is turned on. You would not want the broilerelement to turn on while baking or else your cake would be toast. In its defense, with includedseparate grill plate, this does a better job of broiling meats than other air fryer designs as long as it is nota big roast or a whole chicken. As for baking anything, forget about it with this device since upperheating element cannot be turned off. For most smaller amounts of food, this will do a decent job inboth upper and lower ovens. Also, the top of the oven gets very hot when the upper oven is used.Therefore, you would not want to set anything on the top in general, unless you want to use it as awarming plate.",

Each chamber isn\u2019t massively huge. It's not going to be the same size as a large toaster oven for example. You CAN get those units if you want, that are large enough to do a small game hen..etc but this is not one of those.However, if you are coming from a regular-size toaster oven like I was, this is an excellent upgrade and this is probably more for you. You can do all the things you were doing with your toaster oven (providing it was a regular-sized unit), plus WAY more now, and it\u2019ll cook your food much more evenly.Even things like toasted bread products will cook SO much better in this vs a regular toaster oven because it uses both the heating elements and the heated air to circulate that around your food from what I understand. I might be wrong about that, but either way, the results are way better than anything I had before and I could hear the fans running even when I did just toasted items.I love that it has 2 chambers so you can put a small pizza in the top one and something else in the bottom for example. Different foods and trays are used in specific upper or lower ovens. The grilling plate for example you use in the upper only. So just pay attention to the manual that way you cook the right food you want in the right oven. You get all the features you see in the images. Baking, Airfrying, Broiling, Reheating, Grilling, Roasting, Warming. Toast and Pizza have their own dedicated buttons.When you do something like toast, you will see a number option from 1-7. That means the \u201cShade\u201d or darkness of the toast. You can use your temps on baking and other things all the way up to 475 If I remember correctly. That's pretty cool in my opinion.Is this the largest airfryer you can get? No, but does it have 2 ovens you can use and sync at the same time? It sure does. Can you still do a lot of different kinds of cooking in this? You sure can. My opinion is, if you are coming from a toaster oven, then this is for you. If you are someone that is serious about cooking then you\u2019ll probably want to explore other options so you have a bigger unit, or maybe just 1 oven instead of 2 so you can maximize the size, but I think for MOST people this will work very well for them.",

                "reviewText": "This is larger than a toaster oven, but not large enough to replace your standard oven. If you have the counter space and are looking for something like that, this works well. The top oven is where you will do most of your baking. The lower oven does work very similar to the top oven, but less space. So the lower oven will be for items that have a low profile but you don't have time to wait for the top oven to finish baking.Because there are two ovens, and this is a countertop oven, the upper oven does not have a lot of room. It takes a little experimenting to avoid burning what you're cooking. The oven does get hot on the outside. The manufacturer recommends you use protection under it if your countertop cannot handle high heat. That means get a heat-resistant silicon mat, or maybe find a rack to raise it for better circulation under the oven. IT would be nice if the manufacturer included that mat. I have it on a Formica countertop and that did get pretty warm. Not enough to burn the formica, but maybe if you are using the lower oven with the highest heat (450#) for a long period, it might. I put a mat under it so I don't need to even think about that.The handles seem to get hotter than I anticipated so use your oven mitts. It might be I had both ovens working at the same time. Considering how many features they have going on in such a compact space, be aware of what you are working with. If you are just making toast or heating leftovers there wouldn't be much concern.",
