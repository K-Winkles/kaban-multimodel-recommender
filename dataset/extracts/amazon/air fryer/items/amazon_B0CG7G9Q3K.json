                "reviewText": "I have had this toaster oven for a week and used it every day. My only problem is reading the dials. The area where I located the oven does not have the brightest light available. Reading the dials is very difficult. All models of Air Fryers in this price range seem to have the controls on the side. Maybe if my eyes were young operating the oven would be easier.",

                "reviewText": "I got this to replace my ancient toaster oven that finally stopped working. I love that it is a multi-device I can toast, bake, broil, and air fry. Nice size can toast 6 slices at a time and also great for cooking smaller items like pizza and chicken. Comes with everything you need including mesh basket, bake pan, and broil rack. Very easy to use and clean when you are done. Dials are well labeled and easy to turn. You can cook so many things in this all in one it has been a game changer. The nice part in the summer is not having to turn on the oven and heat up the house if we are just cooking something smaller.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars No simple rack comes with this \"toaster\" oven!",
                "reviewText": "It's my bad for not noticing that this only comes with an air frying basket and small pan, and NOT an actual simple rack shelf. But everyone (including the company itself) acknowledges that this thing is not really a legit air fryer yet an excellent little toaster oven like the ones of old with a hotter setting that they're calling an air fryer. So I feel that this is a major omission that a simple rack shelf is not included. The air frying basket has turned up edges, so you can't put a little pizza in there for example and have it lie flat unless it fits within the confines of the edges of the basket, which shaves off quite a bit of otherwise usable space in the oven to accommodate things that need to lie flat that you want to cook/toast/reheat from both above and below simultaneously. It's a essential missing part of a well designed toaster oven IMO, so a disappointment for us. That said, we'll use it this week to see how well it operates and whether we're happy with it. If it's great, no problem and I'll update my review. But at this point it's a 3/5. Seems like it \"could\" work \"ok,\" but it's not our optimal set up for a toaster over for sure.",
