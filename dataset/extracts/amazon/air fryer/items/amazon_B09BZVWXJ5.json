                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing if you like gadgets",
                "reviewText": "From what you read, you'd think that anything you put into an Air Fryer will cook perfectly and taste delicious every time. They are however just convection ovens that simplify things and clean up quickly. Air fried foods can be tasty but there still can be trial and error with any recipe. Every cooking chart of Air Fryer times/temperatures I have seen has noticeably different numbers for the same foods. Peoples' cooking preferences are different, preheating can be relevant, and smaller fryers tend to cook faster. Spraying most vegetables using an olive oil or avocado oil spray bottle is absolutely necessary before cooking for a tasty exterior so definitely get one. I like the spray bottles made of glass.This Air Fryer is very well-designed and has features that many others don't. Small footprint for a 5-quart Air Fryer, a window, fairly basic control panel, temperature probe, good underside airflow for items that don't happen to get flipped, 2-minute (claimed) boost for extra crisping, all black color, display turns off after 20 min of inactivity except for one dim button, pre-heating probably not as important due to having a halogen bulb instead of a regular element, draws only 950 watts, and square shape of basket maximizes surface area better than a round basket to place more items. Biggest concern is that the halogen bulb may not last nearly as long as the regular type of element that most air fryers use.It's common to choose Air Fryer size based on \"one quart per person\". This five quart air fryer's unique features influenced my buying decision over the Instant Vortex Plus 4 qt which is simple and known to cook consistently inside and out, along with also having a dehydrate function. I would have bought the Vortex if I didn't feel capable of working with the Chefman as a \"gadget\". I don't know if the plastic or non-stick surfaces have toxic particles because this is not written anywhere. I bought 7.8\" square paper liners (which are a little large but work well) to separate food from the Teflon and also for easier cleanup. Any liners close to this size will work about the same for this 5 qt Chefman. I usually trim around the edges 3/4\" or so to make them slightly smaller. I also occasionally use a hole punch (designed for notebook paper) to punch holes in the liners in a similar pattern as the holes on the sample flat liners that came with the machine. This can improve both underside airflow and overall browning/crispness for some foods. I very slightly enlarged the hole that the probe wire fits through so it won't crush the wire long term but I don't recommend doing this unless you are very good with tools.It is rare to see an Air Fryer that uses a halogen bulb instead of a regular heating element except in larger air fryers with glass bowls. The bulb is much shorter than a regular coiled element so it uses about 30% less wattage and gets hot quickly. It cycles on about every 40 seconds and off 12 seconds at 400F costing about 25 cents per hour of use. The air flow seems to very evenly surround the food including the underside and the fan is powerful. If the halogen bulb lasts several years with minimal use, I definitely will have made the right decision over buying the Instant Vortex Plus. If the bulb ever went out, removing - replacing - and re-wiring would be a task. I haven't been able to find a replacement 1000W bulb however so I don't know if this would even be possible.As a gadget person I decided to take a chance on the bulb life and cooking ability. With minimal use for 6 weeks so far I am very pleased. It's quality built with an all around well thought out design, looks good, and there's no sign of anything peeling off. I have not however seen any dramatic crisping effect so far using the 2-minute boost to 450F button for the particular items I have cooked. Simply adding more time may do the same thing. I was skeptical about the probe but simply hitting the Fish button and placing the probe correctly, produced perfectly cooked Salmon. Absolutely amazing; very pleased.",

After following the directions on cleaning with a soft cloth and warm soapy water by hand, I cooked a salmon filled, using the probe the manufacturer kindly provided, set the timer and stayed nearby.The fish turned out perfectly! I then used the air fryer for my quartered potatoes \ud83e\udd54. Again, I was pleasantly amazed and quite pleased.The information were simple and the instructions provided were easy to follow. I would give this as a gift for friends.I am content with my purchase.",

I first noticed with the first one. I used it and when as my food was cooking I noticed grease on my counter top. So I wasn't sure,so when I removed the oven pan I noticed the leak was coming from the bottom of the pan. Between the inside glass and the pan. I put water in it to be sure. Yes there's a leak. So beautiful careful when you pull out the pan. That's why I returned both orders.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second air fryer. Previously I had an air fryer with 2 smaller baskets. It absolutely cooked like a dream but it didn\u2019t meet our needs. I needed something with one large basket. I took a chance on this unit.Pros: 1) the window!! Wasn\u2019t sure about whether it would be useful when I bought it, but it Definitely is helpful in cooking to perfection. Now, I wouldn\u2019t want one without it. 2) the large size basket. Great size. I can cook 2 packages of hotdogs at once. 3) the halfway beeper. When you set a cook time, it will beep halfway through so you can turn the food over. 4) simplicity. It\u2019s not overly complicated.Cons: 1) I found the probe useless. It\u2019s awkward closing the door on it. I never use it. I use my wireless probe.2) doesn\u2019t get quite the char on the meat like my previous unit but still good. 3) I thought the temp went up to 450, but I haven\u2019t found it. 400 is the high temp.Overall I would give this unit 8.5 out of 10.",
