The only downside to this is that you have very limited space to put your food. If you use your tray you could add food to the corners, obviously you cannot do it with the liner. I love using the liner. It does what it is supposed to do. Great quality and sturdiness. I recommend this product.",

Just be aware that they aren't suitable for cooking with oil - I learned this the hard way when I tried to make a burger in the air fryer. If oil gets \"burned\" onto the liner, it can be really difficult to clean off. No matter how much I scrubbed or soaked it, the oil residue just wouldn't come off. But, if you use these liners for cooking with no oil, they clean up very well. Plus, the pack comes with 5 pieces, so you can easily switch them out. The tabs on the sides make it safe and simple to remove the liners even when they are hot.",

These 8 inch air fryer silicone liners are the perfect size for my 4 to 7QT air fryer and have made cooking and cleaning up afterwards so much easier.Not only are these liners food safe and reusable, but they have also saved me a ton of time and hassle when it comes to cleaning my air fryer. They fit perfectly into the bottom of the basket and catch any excess grease or food, which makes for an easy clean-up. Plus, since they are made of silicone, they are dishwasher safe and super easy to clean.I love that these silicone liners are versatile and can be used for a variety of different foods. They are great for cooking things like chicken wings, fries, and even veggies, without worrying about them sticking to the bottom of the basket. And since they are reusable, they are a great eco-friendly option for anyone looking to reduce waste in their kitchen.Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase of the 5pcs Silicone Air Fryer Liners. They have made cooking and cleaning up in my air fryer so much easier and I would highly recommend them to anyone who uses an air fryer regularly.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE my Air Fryer, but I HATE cleaning it! When I saw these I immediately got them. I have had silicone baking mats before and I figured if they worked only half as well I would be ahead. To my delight these silicone liners far exceed any expectations I had! They fit perfectly in my Air Fryer (a 5 quart) and work like advertised; they keep all messes inside, are easy to remove from the air fryer with food in them, are easy to clean, and easy to store (I just keep them inside my air fryer). My first use for them was to air fry fish for fish tacos: when done and clean no smell of fish was left in the air fryer OR on the liner. But that\u2019s not all: they can be used in the oven like a baking dish or \u2018spill sheet\u2019 or in the microwave. Having five of these color coded liners is great: I can use one for savory foods, one for sweet foods (like cup cakes), one for egg dishes\u2026basically a different one for different dishes. The only thing to be aware of is their height: they are only 2 in tall which is not a problem unless you are cooking something like a whole chicken in it; still I expect the mess will be almost completely contained to the liner. These are really a must have if you own an air fryer or toaster oven.",
