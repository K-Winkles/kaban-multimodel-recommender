The tray already have visible and deep scratches on it. You can also tell that the coatings came off from those scratches. Too bad for that, cause I like the matte coating and that it fits perfectly in my Breville air fryer. But my purpose for this is to keep the tray in to protect the bottom and heating elements of air fryer from drippings. This looks like it will be a disposable one for my purpose since durability is questionable.",
