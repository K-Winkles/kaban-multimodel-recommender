There are a lot of good recipes in here, and they cover a lot of ground! This is NOT a vegetarian cookbook, nor does it claim to be. There are SOME vegetarian recipes, with many more, mostly fish and chicken, that one could easily make vegetarian or possibly vegan. I say this because I ordered the book not really knowing what to expect, and I'm quite pleased with the selection. There are even some international and Southern recipes in here, such as non fried hush puppies, which I'm really looking forward to!In my opinion, this is a great cookbook for beginners, such as college students, or for people downsizing but who still want to be able to make nice recipes. The preparations seem very straightforward and explanatory, and the smaller quantities are sized for this demographic in particular. I look forward to begin using the book!!",

You get a lot of different recipes which I love, from appetizers, to main dishes to desserts. They are easy to make. At times the frying time is a little off, do to the size of what your frying and personal taste, but I write my notes right in the cookbook.",
