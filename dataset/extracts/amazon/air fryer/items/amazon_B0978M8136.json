                "reviewText": "I have had this appliance for some time but am just now writing a review. This is a wonderful air-fryer and is well-used in my house, and it always produces successful, properly cooked items. The learning curve for this appliance is quite small, because the procedures for use are straightforward. The temperature setting appears accurate. As with most air-fryers, a plus is that frozen meats and other foods are nicely cooked without having to be thawed first. It is a good size for single households or empty-nesters, but also large enough to air-fry a 4 pound chicken in it! It produces unmatched taste and texture for air-fried baking potatoes and sweet potatoes--nice crispy peels/shells and soft, creamy, delicious interiors. This appliance is easy to clean. It saves energy by replacing the oven . But the very best feature is the LIGHT!! With this light, one is able to check on the progress of the foods being cooked without having to open the appliance. That saves having burned or overcooked food, and also allows for the addition (or removal) of other foods being cooked in the same appliance that require differing cook times.I would buy this all over again and would recommend it to friends.",

                "reviewText": "I am thrilled with this Dreo 6.8 qt air fryer! I have been doing research online since I have never used an air fryer but wanted: a good sized basket, but not too heavy or big a unit to manage or store; a view window or door with light; easy to operate for an analytical newbie; easy to clean, non stick plate; temp range up to 450; not too noisy. This fits all my criteria!I had purchased another bigger unit but returned it because the air fryer did not get hot or stay hot enough to cook. I was so disappointed but figured I got a lemon so was hesitant to try again. But after I read about this Dreo model, decided to take another chance.The air fryer arrived safely although there were a few holes punched in the outer cardboard box. However the unit was packed with styrofoam and enclosed in a second box, so there was no physical damage that I could see.The product box was informative and included a Hello and a Thank You for purchasing message along with warranty info and support details. How nice to be recognized and provided with the welcome and important info!Also included is a user guide, a quick reference guide, a 5yr warranty offer, and cookbook! I will use them as I get familiar and comfortable with cooking different foods. Great customer service so far!The air fryer is modern looking with sleek touch control selection features on the top, and a spacious basket with a safety button on the handle to pull out the basket. The fryer is not heavy. The plate fits snugly in the basket. The window and light are wonderful to peek thru during the cooking process without interrupting it.I washed and dried the parts as instructed, plugged it in, and did a test run. The selection features were intuitive and easy to understand, and the fryer was not noisy at all.My first food to air fry was french fries so I used the Menu preset as a test. I peeked inside a few times and at 60% of cooking time, the fryer beeped and the Shake message appeared. I opened the basket and shook the fries, and then continued cooking. The fries were a little overdone but I was so happy they were hot and cooked, and the fryer did everything per the instructions! Yea! I will adjust the cooking time or remove the fries sooner next time. The fryer works like it is supposed to! How wonderful! And the plate was easy to clean.I did enroll in the 5yr warranty but I am thinking so far I wont need to use it. I am very happy with this air fryer and appreciate a great product with customer service and support if needed. Thank you!",

                "reviewText": "My old airfryer (which I loved) needed to be replaced, but was no longer on the market. I bought one of the better known brands but had to return it after a week. So back to shopping\u2026. I found this Dreo air fryer with great reviews. I liked the features presented, so, though not familiar with the brand, I went ahead and ordered it. And have I been more than pleased. It has several functions and features for a variety of recipes. But what I loved the most were the most well written instructions, user guide and recipe book I have ever received with any product. You can tell that great care was taken in making this machine a pleasure to use, easy to navigate the menu. Great job guys!! I love that it is quiet, very easy to clean. It does not take up a lot of space. The basket is roomy and easy to pull out. It even has a light inside you can turn on just to check on the progress of the food inside.Back to the instructions: the set up instructions were detailed very simply and easy to follow, easy diagrams, good clear fonts used. The chart included is great for a quick at a glance to determine which function you need. Easy to remember after a few uses. I love that it has Roast, Broil, Air Fry, Grill, Bake, Dehydrate and other features. It also explains why Preheat can make a difference, and they are right. Besides the functions, you an also select from the menu food categories, which is another convenient feature.As for the cook book that came with it, unlike the one for the previous machine I bought (and returned) this 108 page recipe book actually has very usable recipes for each function, so it made it easy to explore and use them. And great pictures for each one. I have tried several, to my great satisfaction. I do wish that in the recipes they would bold the function to use or let you know in the first step which one you will be using. (Just a thought). I can say that I have been using it every day for one thing or another with any given meal.Yes, I highly recommend this product, good quality, good value for my money, easy to use, easy to clean, works great, what else can I say but thank you to the makers of this air fryer. The manufacturers care not only about the quality of their product but also care about the consumer using it. That says alot.",
