                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very good with only a minor flaw",
                "reviewText": "Very good fryer. Well made and attractive on the counter. Controls are excellent and easy to read and use, I particularly like the knob for setting time and temperature, much better than the up and down push buttons on some other fryers.As for cooking it does what it\u2019s supposed to do, heats evenly, and crisps when you want it to. One thing I was a bit surprised at was just how well it works when reheating food. It\u2019s not quite as fast as the microwave but food comes out much more evenly warmed and much closer to how it was when it was first cooked. It even crisps up the skin on leftover chicken.Also, this unit has a very good non-stick coating and it\u2019s a real breeze to clean. Typically after emptying the food I just sit the fryer basket in the sink, give a couple of squirts of dish soap and fill it with hot water. After dinner a quick brush and rinse and it\u2019s perfectly clean.So, there are only two downsides. First, even though this is a large six-quart machine don\u2019t even think about cooking two pounds of chicken wings (or fries) in a single batch.. For things to get really crispy you need to limit yourself to a single layer on the bottom which ends up being about half the number of wings I can cook on a single cookie sheet in my convection oven. I admit they come out a bit crisper in the fryer but two batches takes longer than one big batch in the oven plus you have to heat the oven anyway to keep the first batch how while you cook the second. I already knew this would be the case before I bought it and I do have a regular convection oven for large batches so I\u2019m not complaining but just giving others the heads up that advertising isn\u2019t necessarily reality. .The second downside, and the one thing that I\u2019m not particularly happy about, is the automatic preheat which you cannot turn it off. It\u2019s unnecessary when you\u2019re just wanting a quick reheat but it gets a bit bothersome when the timer goes off and you see your food needs a couple more minutes before it\u2019s ready. I hit air fry again, select two minutes and then start but the thing absolutely insists on reheating again even though it\u2019s already hot. Again, this is certainly not a deal breaker but it can be a bit irritating at times.One last thing that others have complained about is the initial smell the machine gives off when first used. Yes, it was smelly at first, particularly when I went through the first recommended heat cycle but I had my cooktop exhaust fan running the whole time. Sure, it smelled, but the smell was certainly not the \u201cOMG I\u2019M BEING POISONED\u201d nonsense others have claimed. The unit continued to smell for probably the first five uses but that\u2019s it and it\u2019s gone.Overall I really like the things I can do with the fryer rather than firing up the big oven (and waiting twenty minutes for it to reach temp) and it is more useful than I thought it would be (and it certainly does crisp better than even a good convection oven). Unexpectedly it\u2019s also really great at reheating chicken and pork chops which wasn\u2019t something I had originally considered. Overall it\u2019s a good purchase.",

The size is just right, striking a balance between accommodating large portions and fitting comfortably on the kitchen countertop.The rapid hot air circulation technology employed by the Vortex guarantees that your food gets that irresistible crispiness on the outside while remaining tender and juicy on the inside. I've been particularly impressed with the even cooking results across various dishes, from fries to chicken, creating a mouthwatering texture that's hard to achieve with traditional ovens.Cleanup is a breeze, thanks to the non-stick coating on the cooking basket and crisper plate. The removable components are dishwasher-safe, making post-meal cleanup quick and convenient.

                "reviewText": "I haven't used all it's features but so far- it toasts bread poorly. 'Dark level toast' (highest level) (and it hardly gets browned even) takes 6min. The round dial to quickly choose modes of cooking is so sensitive, too easy to scroll past the list and indicator light for each mode is so tiny. push buttons would have been better.",

                "reviewText": "It's simple and easy to use and does a great job cooking the food evenly. It has a great size basket. Even though it's \"only\" a 6 quart, the basket itself is a large size so has great surface area for the cooking. This makes it quicker to cook and requires less shaking of the basket to get the heat through to the inside. Highly recommend!",
