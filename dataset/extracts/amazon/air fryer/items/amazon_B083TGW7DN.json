                "reviewText": "This was purchased to replace a nearly identical unit from the same manufacturere that failed right at two years of usage. Hence, despite the fact that we use this air fryer pretty mich every day, durability is a question mark. The failure on the original was the main ciruit board / touch controls as I was able to verify power all the way through the safety switch for the basket to the controller.We obviously liked how well the first one worked enough to purchase a replacement. I think that says most of what needs to be said. The fryer is easy to use and worked well up to the point of failure. I am hopeful we can get more than two years out of this one. Time will tell.Folks, if you are considering an air fryer with a wire basket....They are a BEAR to clean. The solid basket is MANY TIMES EASIER to hand clean.",

This one is one of the \"good ones\" and we honestly love it and use it at least 5-6 times a week. Cleaning it is very simple, although it does require a little work to get some of that \"baked on\" grease out, but it's not bad at all. Cooks quickly, good comes out crispy and juicy!

The only complaint is the smell. Before you use it, I HIGHLY recommend that you give the basket a good hard scrub to get the coating or whatever they spray on it off.

As shown in picture this is the size of the container and also can come with a grilling plate for anything you want to grill. It is used pretty much everyday. Definitely recommend it. Curs cooking time in half or more",
