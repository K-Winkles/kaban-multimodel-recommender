                "reviewText": "These parchment liners are such a good find! When using them, there is no cleanup needed other than disposing of the liner. This is a time saver, no doubt. They fit into the smaller Ninja DualZone 2-Basket Air Fryer. They might be a tad larger than the drawer but they fit and it doesn't hinder the functionality at all. We like that they came in their own container so they don't get dirty while sitting out, or crushed in a drawer. Also like that they are unbleached. They feel sturdy. We have used quite a few of these and they never leak or tear, even when they have grease on them and we pull them out of the air fryer with a heavy load of food inside.We usually have to cook items around 5 minutes longer than usual when using these liners. Not a big deal when you have no cleanup. The liner blocks some of the circulating air so the food may not quite as crispy, but still very good. Also, the food sits in more of the grease on the liner since it doesn't drip down into the air fryer, and that might contribute. We would normally shake the food around in the baskets midway through cooking. We were not able to do it with these because the parchment liner slides around and the food does not, so we use tongs to manually turn the food. This works fine with things like chicken tenders. It doesn't work so well with a basket of fries or tots because the they are soft mid-way through cooking and they break or get smashed by the tongs. Even with manual turning, they just don't seem to cook as evenly. So these liners may not work for all cooking situations.This is great addition to our air fryer. Even with the caveats, we still use them all the time.",
