                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying that the Ultrean Air Fryer has revolutionized my culinary adventures! As a self-proclaimed food enthusiast with a penchant for fried delights, I have always been on the lookout for a healthier alternative to traditional deep frying. Lo and behold, the Ultrean Air Fryer came into my life, and it has exceeded all expectations!First things first, let's talk about the design. The sleek black exterior of this air fryer immediately caught my eye, and it seamlessly fits into any modern kitchen decor. The LCD digital screen adds a touch of sophistication, making it easy to navigate through the various settings and cooking modes. It's like having a mini-computer dedicated solely to perfecting your favorite dishes.Now, let's dive into the cooking performance. The Ultrean Air Fryer boasts a generous 4.2-quart (4-liter) capacity, providing ample space for family-sized portions. Whether I'm frying chicken wings, roasting vegetables, or baking crispy French fries, this air fryer delivers exceptional results every time. The nonstick frying pot ensures effortless cleaning, saving me valuable time and elbow grease.One of the standout features of the Ultrean Air Fryer is its oilless cooking capability. As someone who used to shy away from fried foods due to health concerns, this was a game-changer. With just a fraction of the oil required for traditional frying methods, I can now enjoy guilt-free indulgence without compromising on taste. The hot air circulation technology ensures that my food is evenly cooked and delightfully crispy on the outside, while retaining its juicy goodness on the inside.I must mention the UL certification, which speaks volumes about the safety and quality of this appliance. Knowing that the Ultrean Air Fryer has undergone rigorous testing and meets the highest industry standards provides peace of mind during every cooking session. It's essential to have confidence in the tools we use in our kitchen, and this air fryer certainly delivers on that front.Let's talk about the user experience. The Ultrean Air Fryer is incredibly user-friendly, even for those who are not particularly tech-savvy. The intuitive interface and clear instructions ensure a seamless cooking process. I appreciate how I can easily customize the temperature (ranging from 180\u00b0F to 400\u00b0F) and cooking time with just a few taps on the control panel. It's like having a personal sous chef guiding me through the culinary journey.Now, let me share a funny anecdote that showcases the versatility of the Ultrean Air Fryer. One day, in a moment of culinary bravado, I decided to experiment with unconventional ingredients. I attempted to air fry a batch of pickle chips, hoping to recreate the deep-fried delicacy found at county fairs. To my surprise, the Ultrean Air Fryer not only cooked them to perfection but also managed to retain the tangy flavor and crunch that I adore. I was able to enjoy a healthier version of a guilty pleasure without leaving my home!Lastly, the customer service provided by Ultrean deserves a special mention. I had a minor issue with the air fryer's power cord, and their responsive and friendly support team quickly resolved the matter. The 1-year warranty provided further reassurance that I was investing in a durable and reliable product.In conclusion, the Ultrean Air Fryer has been a game-changer in my kitchen. Its sleek design, impeccable cooking performance, oilless cooking capability, and user-friendly interface make it an indispensable tool for any cooking enthusiast.

                "reviewText": "Two reasons this will change your life - 1 - fries and 2 - wings. Not only that, you can have them whenever you want them, they are both incredibly delicious and way healthier than the deep fried versions. I've successfully made both and I'd bet that most people wouldn't have any idea that zero oil was used. It's super easy to use, super easy to clean and absolutely a life changing purchase.Another great feature is that it contains the heat very well. I don't even notice the heat in my kitchen, unlike if I had the oven on at 360 - 400 degrees.The only downside I can see is if you need to cook for several people. It's perfectly sized for one person but I imagine if you wanted to make enough for 4-5 people, it would be a hassle. It does work best when you can space the food on the tray and not have layers. And that means single servings. I'm sure there are larger ones you can buy if that's a problem.Fries - The key is to use a russet potato. All I do is slice it up to the size of fries that I want, drop them in the basket, turn it on 360 for about 10 minutes and then 400 for about 5 and I'm presented with delicious, perfectly cooked and crispy on the outside fries. I experimented with soaking the potatoes like others say, but I didn't notice much of a difference. I also didn't find that adding any oil was necessary. If I get a craving for fries and I have a potato in the house, I'm eating delicious and healthy fries twenty minutes later.Wings - Wings are almost as easy and fast. I buy them precut from the grocery store and just give them a coating of salt and some seasoning. No oil at all. I cook about 15 minutes at 360 until they are brown all over and then up the heat to 400 for about another 10 minutes until they crisp up. From there, I take them out and coat them with whatever sauce I want and I have a significantly healthier alternative to deep fried wings and just as satisfying. They do not dry out the way they would in a conventional oven.If you're a single guy, you need this. And imagine the astonishment of your friends when you tell them how you've been losing weight - by eating more fries and wings.",

It\u2019s easy to clean and the basket is a decent size. My only complaint (and maybe this is user error) is figuring out how to stop it if I take something out early. When you remove the basket, it stops cooking, but when you close it again it resumes and I haven\u2019t been able to figure out how to turn it off without unplugging it.Other than that, I love it, and it\u2019s perfect for first time buyers.",

                "reviewText": "We've had this since Christmas and we've used our oven and toaster oven way less. Frozen fries are very easy, chicken strips, fish and chips, all easy. Google search is your friend for recipes. Reheating pizza and restaurant fries taste way better too. Cleaning is very easy as well. You will lose those little rubber feet on the basket if you aren't careful. I'm down to 2 out of 4, it does not effect performance at all. It will just rub your OCD the wrong way like it does mine. Overall, happy with the purchase, worth it.Also, if you register your product you will probably get offered a free gift. I chose two USB-C cables, took about a month to show up but they will show up. However, me being in Canada and the items shipping from the US, I was dinged about $25 on duty, so not free. They declared the value at $100 USD, which made it $128.12 CAD at the time. $6.41 in GST, $8.97 in PST and a $9.95 Handling Fee. If I had known that, I would have passed on the cables that I currently have no use for. Maybe one day they will become relevant, I'm sure they will, just not today.",

Das Ger\u00e4t wird aussen nur warm aber niemals heiss und der Kochgeruch ist auch kaum wahrnehmbar. Die ersten paar Mal gebrauchen und dann geht der Plastikgeruch auch weg und immer vor Inbetriebnahme die Gebrauchsanleitung lesen und sich daran halten. Es w\u00e4re toll, wenn es dieses Ger\u00e4t auch von 80-230 Grad g\u00e4be. Aber auch so bekommt man wunderbar zartes Fleisch gebraten.
