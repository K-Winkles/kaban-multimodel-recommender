Sometimes, though, I would have to run it twice in order to fix enough for both my husband and me. This new 8-quart air fryer eliminates the need to run two batches through. It has already eliminated extra time in the kitchen for me (hooray!) and I'm able to do larger items as well. This week I cooked a whole chicken, and it came out looking good enough to be featured in an advertisement. Wish I would have taken a picture of it.The touch controls are very easy to figure out and operate. When the cooking is done, it is also very easy to clean. I wash dishes by hand. This cleans quickly and easily. I really love this machine and certainly recommend it if you are looking to fix larger meals.",

My family is small but it can do a good portion for us that would last 2 days.It has a sleek design, it's touchpad so I would suggest being very careful where you're storing it and that nothing goes on top of it. It's not that loud, runs quiet (for us, anyhow) and seems to do a good job at cooking. I think it takes a little longer with some recipes but honestly it's supposed to reduce the energy we use so I plan on using it alone on some days and then other days use my oven/stove.It comes with a nice booklet that gives great instructions and tips. It's super easy to wash the basket and clean the grill plate. The timer function works well and there are lots of settings that are available. I haven't used them all yet. For my first one, I am very happy with it!",

I have had quite a few air fryers and have learned that I don\u2019t like the ones that have doors, as they are hard to use and even harder to clean. I don\u2019t want something small because it is so limiting and takes a lot of extra time to do things twice. This style with the large pull-out basket is the best. I like the rack that they include to raise your food up off the bottom of the basket, it keeps it out of any drippings that may occur during cooking. It cooks quickly and evenly, is easy to clean and is very easy to use. Thus far I have zero complaints and absolutely love it.",
