We use it as a microwave to reheat food, it's quick thank goodness for the glass because the food would burn. We also use it to cook wings and fries and it works great, I strongly suggest that you watch your food to avoid over cooking/heating as it heats and cooks very fast. Thirdly, it's easy for the kids to operate, I have 2 teenagers that are always hungry, they don't have any issues using this Air Fryer. I tell you it's worth the money I paid for it. Get yours today, you won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: 1) glass part , only metal is the coated grate for food to sit on 2) can see without opening how the food is cooking or overcooking 3) settings are simple and spot on for what I\u2019ve cooked 4) perfect size for one or two people and doesn\u2019t require a lot of space 4) easy to cleanCons: 1) handle is a little wiggly 2) my main complaint is that it is difficult to find the right position for the red light to come on when sliding the glass part into place. There is a slot for it but I have to move around a bit to get the red light on. 3) second complaint is when I do get the glass container positioned so the red light will come on and the heating will begin it will go off after a minute or two and I have to reposition the glass container. That\u2019s a real hassle for when you set it and walk away only to find later it\u2019s not cooking even though the timer is still going. 4) I followed directions to off-gas the air fryer and did it outside on my patio. The smell was INTENSE. The smell was so strong I continued to let it heat up for 20 minutes at a time for two hours. Only then did I think it was safe enough to bring in the house. Then I washed it twice in soap and water, air drying in between washes. No smell after washing but jeez I had serious doubts the chemical smell would ever come out when off-gassing it. 5) the top of the whir handle has a light brown burn mark on it and I have no idea how that happened as the handle part isn\u2019t place directly under the heat source.So I would return but I missed the return date. I\u2019m using it but wish it was a better product. The concept of glass is awesome, but the amount of off-gassing was disturbing.",

                "reviewText": "Ugh. I really wanted this to work! The size is perfect for one and it isn\u2019t made of nonstick material. However, while running the initial offgas cycle, I\u2019ve had to go in and jiggle the pot to connect about four times in five minutes. That doesn\u2019t work for me. Sending it back and continuing the search for a small, glass air fryer. Junk",

                "reviewText": "WHY THIS UNITMy last air fryer stopped working (Elite Platinum EAF-05SS Digital 3.2Qt Hot Air Fryer after 2+ years of use. That unit was 1400-Watts, Oil-Less Healthy Cooker, Temp/Timer Settings, PFOA/PTFE F)I chose that unit because it had a 304 grade Stainless Steel Basket; dishwasher safe and BPA-free.LIKES. Lower wattage (900 watts) convection air fryer (360-degree dry heat ). Small 3-quart glass basket. No pre-heating required. No oil required, but I lightly spray my meats for a crunchier exterior. Able to fit 8 wing pieces in the container, so have to batch cook them. Just set the timer for the given food item (pictures and recommended times on top of the unit). There is a loud timer bell when the food is finished.. Chicken wings and thighs were crunchy, moist and tender. Clean up was a breeze. Just wait 30 mins for the glass container to cool and wash with warm soapy waterDISLIKES. There is a 1-time, 30-min break-in time to burn off any chemicals/odors from the glass and/or frying rack. It emits a strong odor, so make sure your area is well ventilated. There were no subsequent issues with material odors after the break-in process.. Not sure what material the removable frying rack is made of (non-stick surface with rubber legs). If it is Teflon, then it defeats the purpose of a healthy cook surface. I need to know if it is PFOA/PTFE free. The rack elevates your food just enough so the convection and heat circulation thoroughly cooks your food.. Will contact manufacturer to find out about fryer rack material and whether a stainless steel rack can be used in the glass basketUSED FOR: 2-person meals of air fried chicken wings, chicken thighs, sweet potato fries. Will try skinless chicken next time as a healthier alternative2/15/23 UPDATEAir fried a thick ribeye steak, 12 mins. PERFECT!!Juicy, tender, lightly pink in the middle. Delicious.",
