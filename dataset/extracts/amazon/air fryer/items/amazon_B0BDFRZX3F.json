The digital controls are straightforward and the fryer pauses when the basket is pulled for 'shaking'. I like that it fits under the cabinet. It looks good enough to have on the counter, but I prefer to keep small appliances that I don't use every day under the counter. Less clutter.This fryer cooks very well with both frozen and fresh food. The cooking reference guide gets you in the ballpark right away for food, temp and time. Foods are flavorful, crispy on the outside and stay moist and juicy inside.The fryer cleans easily. It looks like it is designed to where the basket and grate are about the only parts that need washing, the inside of the fryer stays very clean even when using oil to cook (or cooking drumsticks!). Great product.",

As someone that was Mr. Microwave I now rarely even use the microwave unless I cant fit it in this air fryer.For the price it\u2019s unbelievable has 4 pre programmed settings which honestly is all I ever use. I may adjust the time for the different modes but the temperature settings are perfect.This is also the perfect size for any of the small mini frozen pizzas even the deep dish kind and cooks them perfectly every-time.Super easy to clean comes with a nice little crisper tray. This thing also is absolutely perfect for reheating anything back to perfection especially any fast food reheats it including the buns perfect.If you were curious about getting into air frying like I was this is the perfect starter because of how easy it is to use, its super small foot print, preprogrammed settings and this brand is absolutely top notch also , buy it you wont regret it.",

This adorable air fryer is perfect for one and makes my meat delicious so fast! Actually I love meat so sometimes I have to use it twice to cook my entire amount of desired ground beef patties, or chicken wings, or even prime rib. It is so easy to clean! That was my worst task before. Why didn't I get this long before?",

                "reviewText": "I'll be the first to say I'm really \"duh\" when it comes to seeing what real sizes are in my head. I thought the 2 quart would be fine for me as I cook alone a lot, but, it's pretty small. Not their fault - mine for misjudging what I needed. This is just large enough to fit ONE large burger \"or\" ONE large Chicken breast OR around 8 Mozzarella sticks, etc. You're not going to really get two different items of a decent portion size in this. One main item or some fries or sticks, etc. That's it. Knowing what I know now, I would have opted for one of their larger (4 qt?) models. That being said - it's easy to use, works well, and is pretty easy to clean. I do tend to have to leave the heat on a minute or two longer than instructions say (for my taste), but this is still a good way to eat healthier.",
