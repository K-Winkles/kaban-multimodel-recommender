                "reviewText": "I love the kalorik air fryer. The only problem I have with it is the weird material that the crumb tray is made out of. I found out too late that you should not put the crumb tray in the dishwasher. The finish started coming off. I was going to order another crumb tray or get the first crumb tray resurfaced or something but I realized what I should do. I put some olive oil on the crumb tray and rubbed 00 steel wool to clean the metal. It took the finish off down to the metal and shined it up a bit. Then I washed all the oil off and put it in the air fryer for about five minutes at 400\u00b0. Now it is shiny and perfect.",
