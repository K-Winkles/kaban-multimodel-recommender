                "reviewText": "This is a versatile product from hamilton beach. Hamilton beach is a name brand company, so you can generally trust their products. As well as know that they will have good customer service, that will be around for years to come. The item is ready to use out of the box, and comes with different racks to help with specific tasks. There are different rack positions as well. I like the convection function to \"air fry\". In general it does a good job for most things, including indoor \"grilling\" (of sorts). The dials and buttons are easy to read and use, and the digital screen is a great way to have a visual of everything, including some functions. It is priced fairly for the quality and versatility. It is a good, well made product, from a reputable company, so 4 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I love this toaster oven combo! I love the different modes on it, but even more so, I LOVE the different arrows on the front that show where to put the rack for each type of cooking/baking you plan to do in it. We are a family of 8 and our oven has been broken for the better part of a year, so I've been exclusively baking in the toaster oven and I honestly don't know if I want to go back to a regular gas oven. I've made everything from cookies and cakes, to sourdough bread and pizza in this thing and it works so well! Very impressed.",

                "reviewText": "We held out on the air fryer craze. Finally bought this and we probably have used it every single day since. I\u2019d say it\u2019s one of the best purchases I\u2019ve made for our kitchen. Don\u2019t know why we held out so long. Throw out the other appliances (kidding. But am I?) and make room for this air frying bad boy! Quick and efficient. Seems well built and easy to use. Nice display and tactile controls. Came with good accessories. It\u2019s an air fryer and a toaster. We\u2019ve used it for toast, chicken, left overs, cookies, kid food etc. Be aware that cooking time varies based on what tray you select. The wire rack cooks a lot faster than the trays.",

                "reviewText": "This Hamilton Beach Sure Crisp Air Fryer Toaster Oven Combo is the company's entrant in the low-cost air fryer/toaster oven combo landscape.Like others on the market, Hamilton Beach has created this device with basically no insulation. The outside gets HOT, so be careful to only grab the handle on the door and nothing else.The entire appliance is very lightweight and made of thin stainless steel. It includes inserts for air frying, grilling, and roasting/toasting, and they're all fine, but fairly flimsy.The device works okay, but not great at its main jobs of air frying and toasting. Pre-heating before baking or air frying is essential. The air fryer takes sometimes much longer than you think it should based on instructions on the box of whatever you're cooking.Some of the frozen mozzarella sticks I've cooked often begin to leak cheese while others in the same basket aren't quite cooked through. Bagels and bread toast well, but I'd like a way to reduce the heat coming from either the top or bottom to keep the outside of the bagel less hot.During thanksgiving, I cooked a 10x6 Pyrex dish of sweet potatoes in this oven, and found it came out quite well, despite taking about 1.5 hours to bake.The controls are complicated, but not too bad once you're figured them out. I like that they're all digital on the screen, and the knobs are easy to understand once you get the hang of them. The instruction manual does a good job of telling you how to use the device.All in all, I'd say this is a decent appliance, but I wish it air fried better than it does. I would give it 4 stars if I could reliably make crispy, gooey mozzarella sticks without some getting overcooked.",
