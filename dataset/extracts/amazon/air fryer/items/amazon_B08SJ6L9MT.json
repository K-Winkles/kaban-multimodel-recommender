                "reviewText": "one of the first things I noticed is how easy it is to separate the inner basket from the fryer container.The swirl pattern of the metal container is what I believe to be the compl\u00e9ment parfait in air frying.The circulation of the air, especially underneath, is what makes these appliances so useful. Yet, cleaning the container takes a bit of attention, especially since there is a silicone grommet in the center. I attempted to reduce some of the cleaning requirement by ordering the Lotteli inserts, which I have unartfully trimmed to fit. Even without the inserts, the fryer is a godsend. cooks frozen french fries very well, heats leftover pizza perfectly, and I have even fried a burger from frozen in it (yet I prefer to use the iron skillet for meat; now that I discovered the manner to keep it perfectly non-stick).Getting the temp and time requirements sorted out is all trial and error. I have not used the kitchen+ app yet, and I have used Philips appliances prior and I trust the brand. it has a beeping alarm once it is finished, so bonus there. I have even put in bowls of chili or stew in it for quick heating (I detest the use of microwave for anything save popcorn). works well for that also. Highly recommended, and caught this on the Prime day sale.",

This air fryer is perfect for me\u2013\u2013it's compact, quiet, easy to clean and air fries veggies and fish beautifully.

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Dream come true!",
                "reviewText": "I was looking for an appliance to save heating up my oven in a small apartment during the summer months. It's already muggy where I live, and this air fryer is a marvel. It doesn't get as hot as my toaster! It's not just a fryer; in fact, I have not used it to fry anything, It is an air cooker. It cooks faster than an oven, and the food is excellent. There is an app with recipes to get you started. It is easy to use, easy to clean. So why didn't I give it five stars? For two reasons: (1) there is a terrible burnt plastic smell when you begin to use it. It is a toxic smell that can makesyou very sick. It does go away, but the appliance comes with no warning, and no suggestions for how to get rid of the smell. I looked on the internet and found two possible solutions, neither of which worked. (2) There is zero customer service. Because of the vile odor, I tried contacting Phillips. I tried the Chat function first, but gave up after 45 minutes waiting for an agent to come on line. I tried the telephone number several times. Finally, I reached someone who was aghast that I was having this problem. I don't know why she was so surprised, after all, it is discussed all over the internet! (And yes, I should have read the Amazon reviews more carefully before purchasing.) At any rate, she said she never heard of this, that it could be a safety issue, and that she was \"expediting\" the issue to the \"team,\" and I would hear back within three to five business days. Yes, you are way ahead of me. I never heard back from the \"team,\" or anyone else, except for an aggressive email from a Chat Agent who was apparently offended that I didn't wait longer than 45 minutes for someone to come to my aid, and who said, \"unless I hear from you, I am closing this case.\" Case? What case? Of course, I wrote back immediately, and never heard from the Chat person again! So, long story short, unacceptable customer service is another reason for fewer stars. I find it difficult to have any confidence in a company when it provides no customer support. It tells me that Phillips does not stand behind its products, and buyer beware. If this air fryer survives the summer, I will consider myself lucky. And I will avoid Phillips products in the future.",

So I bought this one as a gift to my mother in-law, since she love deep fried things I thought she would not like this so much and use it way less than I do. Well I was wrong she is loving it and the food cooked in it looks better than the previous model that I have, perhaps because of the easy set up and suggestive recipes on the display screen that makes easy than having to figure out the exactly temperature and time to cook each specific ingredients. The cons I have is that I can\u2019t figure out how to change temperature to centigrade and the basket container is just the same size as my old one (maybe I should research the size better) any way this is a perfect and more compact upgrade from the previous model that is definitely worth buying.",
