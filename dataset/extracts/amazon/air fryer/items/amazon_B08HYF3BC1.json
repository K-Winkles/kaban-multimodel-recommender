                "reviewText": "I was asked to review this air fryer and was happy to do so because it gave me the opportunity to compare this one with the air fryer we have.This is a large and very cool looking air fryer and the digital screen is easy to use and understand. I like the feature of preheating, the other air fryer we have does not have this feature and compared to our other air fryer, it is also much quieter.So now the cooking test. I caught a very nice large Red Drum and decided to try out the air fryer making panko coated red drum. I had 4 nice pieces of fish fillets about 1 \u00bd pounds and they all fit into the basket very nicely. After the preheating I put in the fish and flipped them once half way through. In 12 minutes they were done and came out beautiful, brown, hot, crispy/crunchy and delicious. The really nice thing about the fish is they were not coated in oil and were still more crispy than fried fish.Clean up was a breeze and while they were air frying I was having my salad rather then pan frying fish.This air fryer had no problem fitting in 1 \u00bd lb of fish and by the size of the basket I could easily do a whole chicken. This air fryer is a keeper.",

Finally pulled the trigger after watching a youtube that mentioned this product.So, very easy to use. I've had it about a week now and here's what I've done with it.Fresh fries 3 different times. 2 pieces of salmon once. 6 wings at a time twice now.Everything has come out just fantastic. I'm not a huge salmon fan (wife is) but I'll grill it for her whenever she wants it. Was raining this weekend so I air fried them. Wow!! Fantastic. Just a little crisco and some lemon pepper and it was perfect! No flipping them, no nothing. Just push the fish button and let her rip.I'm sold!I have no idea if other brands are better or do anything different but this thing cooks great, is a good price, cleans ridiculously easy and the food tastes great. What more can you ask for?",

                "reviewText": "We had a 3.4 qt fryer that we got a couple of years back on a Amazon prime day deal. It was interesting when we first got it, but honestly people didn't really use it that much (we leave it in our small office cafeteria). More of us are bringing food from home to work now, and this is when we decided we need to invest in larger air fryer. Ultimately, decided on this because of the size, price, and it's preset settings. Turns out to be a huge hit. To date, we have made:- Brussels sprouts (for 4)- Chicken parmesan (for 4)- Egg rolls (16 pcs at a time)- Taquitos- Salmon- Onion Rings (for 6)- Surf & Turf- Backed potatoes -Cannoli.Go on google, you'll find so much things you can make with an air fryer. Especially a 7.4qt one, that really helps with making sure the food fits in there. Like I said earlier, this fryer has lots of preset and make it so much easier to figure out what to do. The control is easy to understand and responsive (unlike some other appliances where you need to push hard a few times for it to register). The push-to-release handle is a great touch to help removing the tray from the main body.And now comes the part everyone dreads about: cleaning. Fortunately, it's very easy to clean. The inside tray can be easily removed from the outer tray. We simply run some water, rub it a few time with detergent and leave it to drive. Takes a couple of minutes at the most. Not sure what type of coating they have on the tray, it's very easy to clean. If you take a look at inside the air fryer, because edges are rounded, it's easy to clean too.Our office highly recommends this!!",

Unfortunately, the air fryer just died in the middle of cooking steaks and will not turn back on even after trying multiple working outlets. There is no damage to the power cord so maybe a fuse popped but I don't feel like trying to take this thing apart. There is supposedly a 3 year warranty but no way to get in touch with the manufacturer. I'd recommend you stick to a known brand for peace of mind and longevity.",

Por ahora , he probado con patatas, pechugas de pollo, croquetas, brochetas y empanadillas. A mis hijos les han encantado las patatas. Es importante poner un poco de aceite extendido con un pincel por encima y as\u00ed queda dorada y crujiente. Aunque hay que ser consciente de que es una freidora sin aceite, por tanto, exactamente igual que con el sabor de la fritura en aceite no va a quedar, pero el sabor es bueno y la apariencia tambi\u00e9n.En las rese\u00f1as indica que con una capacidad de 12 litros para una familia de 5, 6 e incluso m\u00e1s personas, en mi casa somos 4 y la cantidad es justa. La pr\u00f3xima la comprar\u00e9 de mayor capacidad pero estoy contenta con la compra.",

He hecho verduras rebozadas y el resultado ha sido muy satisfactorio, tiernas y doradas; pero no s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 no me deja cargar la foto, tratar\u00e9 de editarlo m\u00e1s adelante. Ahora estoy deshidratando frutas y apio, en cuanto acabe pasar\u00e9 foto del resultado. Aconsejo que antes de usarla, se laven bien las bandejas y accesorios, se pase un pa\u00f1o h\u00famedo por dentro del horno y se deje unas horas abierta, con un lim\u00f3n dentro, para quitar el olor a pl\u00e1stico.El tama\u00f1o bastante adecuado para mi cocina, que es muy peque\u00f1a.El servicio post venta muy bueno, a m\u00ed me resolvieron un peque\u00f1o mal entendido con mucha profesionalidad (Hay que tener en cuenta que tienen alguna dificultad con el castellano y eso es lo que dio lugar al mal entendido). Me mandaron el recetario en espa\u00f1ol y de lujo.En cuanto vea c\u00f3mo puedo subir las fotos, edito la rese\u00f1a con las mismas, porque de verdad que merece la pena ver el resultado. No me arrepiento de momento de haberla comprado.",
