                "reviewText": "I read it was Teflon-free, so ceramic, which was a requirement for me in an air fryer. I was delighted to see it was so dang cute! And cheap. My only qualm as per other reviews too, is the timer is that super old-school, cheap microwave kind (think crappy microwaves at convenience stores) where you turn it to a time, say 10 mins, and you can\u2019t decide it\u2019s done or you want less time by turning it counter clockwise to say 5 mins. It won\u2019t go. And you can\u2019t turn it off with the timer dial to say 0. It won\u2019t go. It only turns clockwise to a higher amount of time. To me that\u2019s so annoying and inflexible. Giving us less control. What they do is force you to instead pull the tray out in order to stop it, which is awkward. Or unplug it, till the timer runs out on its own.Anyway, for how cute it is and the price, I can live with that, though I hope they fix it in any design updates.It\u2019s perfect for my main reason for buying it: making a single homemade chocolate chip cookies! Lol.Yes, it\u2019s my way to have it all. A tiny fresh-baked cookie in 10 mins time, anytime. I make chocolate chip cookie dough in advance, portion it into individual cookie sizes, and freeze for when I want just one. I used to do this in a toaster oven which air fryers have basically replaced. So, after a meal when I want a small treat, I pop one cookie dough ball into the fryer on a small, heat-safe dish like foil or a tart dish, set the temp pretty low since fryers are basically super-charged convection ovens, about 250\u00b0, at 10 mins (frozen dough takes longer..in a reg oven they\u2019d take 12-13 at 350\u00b0).And bing! I have a delicious cookie! Better than regular ovens since the convection aspect makes cookie edges have that buttery crispness, yet the inside is gooey. Heaven! (Convection means a fan is pushing and swirling hot air all around your food vs it just sitting in stagnant hot air.)Helps me watch my weight, easily making only one at a time. Doesn\u2019t heat up the kitchen (well, a little heat exhaust happens) and is more environmentally friendly.Works well for the same concept in cakes! Make cake batter. Freeze it in a square pan. Once frozen, pop it out of the pan onto a cutting board. Chop it with a large knife into 2\u201d square pieces. Throw into your freezer till you crave it. Then, like the cookies, take a frozen cake batter square out, set it into the fryer and bake! You have a single portion piece of cake! (Though cake batter works pretty well microwaved too since microwaves do moist. Cookie dough needs dry air to bake well so only ovens).",

                "reviewText": "I previously have only used basket style airfryers but wanted to have a 2-in-1 toaster/airfryer that was compact and saved counter space for my apartment. This one was in a good price range and I liked blue color and it is a good size for a household of two. I\u2019ve had it for a month or so now and its decent for the price. Issues I\u2019ve had are:1. The racks don\u2019t fit well in the oven, they fit very loosely. The rack, basket and tray are almost 1mm too small to fit into the grooves of the oven well. Sometimes they will collapse mid use due to heat expansion and the fan blowing2. This machine is \u201ctoo swole\u201d as my partner and I like to describe it. The pre-sets sometimes burn our food on the outside and don\u2019t cook long enough to cook the inside so there\u2019s a learning curve to play with the time and temperature. For example the pre-set for toast is 450F for 6 minutes but that will give you burnt toast. I found 300F for 4 min is better.For now, it does what I need it to so and makes crisp food. However, it is not as simple as set and go and I have to spend more time meticulously placing the trays in to make sure it stays put while it cooks and playing around the time and temperature. In the future, I would probably just invest in a better one for the convenience.",
