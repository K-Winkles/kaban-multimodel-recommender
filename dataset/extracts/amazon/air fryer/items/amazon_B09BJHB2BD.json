                "reviewText": "I upgraded from the small corsori air fryer. So the dual blaze is huge to me! LOL. I am loving it. Still learning my way but everything I have tried so far (have had for 5 days) has turned out great. I especially like the broil option since I like tuna melts and this option melts the cheese instead of heating up the whole sandwich! I do put a liner underneath to catch melting cheese! This thing is super easy to clean. I used the crisping plate for some frozen appetizers and they came out crispy! There is a learning curve for figuring out time and temp - but I recall that was the same for my first air fryer too. If you are considering buying this - just go ahead and do it! I think you will like it!! I like that there is no basket as it was so hard to clean with the vents (I periodically bought new baskets as I could never get them as clean as I would like)!Have now had this air fryer for a month and use it most days. Still loving it! I have bought some foil sheets and parchment liners to use to catch drips and keep basket clean. I have not experienced smoke from drippings. The display buttons are dark but you can hit each one and they light up....you learn where the ones you use are quickly. A little thing I really like is that when I pause and pull the drawer to check on what I am cooking, when I put the drawer back in, the fryer powers back up automatically instead of having to push a button to turn it on again. It is a little thing but I was always hitting then hitting the button again on my former Corsori (small quart size) - guess I was impatient!I do wish Corsori would have put out directions, tips, etc., as I am still not sure when to use the plate or just the drawer. I am concluding that anything I want crispy or that drips fat, then use the plate, otherwise I just use the drawer. Recipes in a compact manual would be nice too. I cook just for me and love the amount of space! I don't need it but it is great to have!",

I have to say that this one has so far worked out to be a superior model to my older models. The older models represented the type with tier racks (heating element on top) and bucket types (also with heating elements on top. This one has dual heating and it is turning out to be a game changer because I no longer need to pre heat before cooking. I like this feature alot.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first air fryer and I love it. I have cooked so many things in this but my favorite is fish. I've never been able to do a decent job of cooking fish in a way that was healthy. Now I can make salmon that's just as good as any restaurant. I can also make lightly breaded fish using very little oil that is delicious and healthy. Shrimp scampi comes out great, too.I love this for chicken, grilled cheese sandwiches, bacon, eggs, French toast, muffins and so much more. I do flip some things because the top gets browner than the bottom but it's not a big deal.Cleaning the basket is very easy. Cleaning the inside is not so easy. I've learned that it's important to clean inside frequently or grease builds up. Putting a little Dawn power wash on a paper towel, letting it sit a bit and then scrubbing helps some. I don't like to spray the power wash inside because it gets under the coil and is hard to wipe up. I've also used Mr. Clean magic eraser. I wish the manual had mentioned how to properly clean the inside. I didn't know I needed to do that right away so there was some build up to work on when I realized that needed to be done. I'm also concerned that there will be build up underneath the coil which is very hard to get to for cleaning.I also wish this had come with a cookbook or even a link to a cookbook. The website doesn't offer much help. It's all done through the app. My phone is pretty full and I didn't want to have to put on another app to get recipes. At least the app isn't needed in order to use the fryer. I haven't had too many problems with adapting other air fryer recipes as long as I check frequently to see if it's done.I'm very pleased with this and have been using it nearly every day. I'm looking forward to using it in the summer instead of my regular oven because it doesn't heat up the kitchen like a big oven will.",

                "reviewText": "I had originally intended a five star ++ review. I held off buying an air fryer because based on other reviews of them, they seemed like high performance junk snack food cookers. Thus Dual Blaze(tm) surprised the heck out of us. Beyond the snacks it has turned out to be an excellent small format convection oven and roaster as well as doing a decent job on a steak to my surprise. It is an impressive appliance. Now for the down side. I think it's a big one. The rubber or silicon bumpers that go on the corners of the grid began failing within 30 days. At 60 days they have pretty much disintegrated. The grid and pan have never been in the dishwasher they are hand washed with a soft sponge and the simple Dawn detergent used to clean oil off ducks in oil spills - no bleach, no abrasives. There are a couple of sellers selling aftermarket bumpers but the price is usurios. I suspect Cosori can solve this but in the interim I think they should be offering owners replacements, if not free, at reasonable cost in bags of 24 or more. You are going to need them. Finally, to end on a positive not, I did end up contacting support on another issue and found it excellent and responsive. Thanks Cosori fir a nearly GREAT product.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Es una excelente opci\u00f3n si te gusta tener lo ultimo en tecnolog\u00eda y disfrutar de una comida rica y saludable. es totalmente compatible con Alexa y la aplicaci\u00f3n Ve Sync tiene muchas recetas y opciones para usarla, adem\u00e1s de sus notificaciones cuando est\u00e1 listo la comida.Es bastante grande para que lo tomes en cuenta al momento de colocarla en la cocina, el panel T\u00e1ctil es bastante bueno, f\u00e1cil de configurar, conectar al wifi y usarEl olor a quemado es solo al principio las primeras veces que la usas, un TIP que te puedo dar para que disminuya o se erradique el olor es que antes de cocinar pongas la canasta con agua, hasta que cubra la rejilla que viene incluida, le agregues elJug\u00f3 de 1 limon y pongas a funcionar la freidora a 205 grados cent\u00edgrados por 5 minutos, luego solo la enjuagas y secas antes de volver a usar.En otro video de YouTube vi que dec\u00edan que la canasta se atora y que se raya de abajo, y si pasa jaja pero solo me pas\u00f3 una vez por usar mucha fuerza, TIP: aplica fuerza con una sola mano y levanta la canasta cuando laIntroduzcas.Por \u00faltimo la funci\u00f3n del dual blaze que promete no tener que sacudir la canasta es parcialmente cierta ya que con las papas gajo y las alitas todo sali\u00f3 bien pero con las frituras de surimi y unos trozos de salchicha y jamon solo se doraron bien por un lado. Entonces a\u00fan as\u00ed recomiendo sacudir la canasta al menos una vez.Solo hay una cosa que no me gusto de esta freidora: el hecho de que hoy 27 de julio el precio de este producto est\u00e9 a\u00fan m\u00e1s barato que en los prime day que yo la compre, as\u00ed que no compr\u00e9 este producto si su precio sobre pasa los $3, 500Solo por ello le puse 4 estrellas",
