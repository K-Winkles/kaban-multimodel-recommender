                "reviewText": "I was very hesitant to purchase these liners. I did not believe they would properly brown the food. My husband kept pointing them out to me and I finally gave in and bought them. I absolutely love the set. I have a 7 qt. Gourmia. Although the cooking surface is a tad bit smaller than the basket of the Gourmia, it is worth it not to have to scrub and soak the mess that is sometimes made in the airfryer basket. The first thing I made was bacon and cheese wrapped shrimp. I added the parchment paper and they cooked to perfection. When I cooked my chicken wings the oil collected in the liner, so I was glad I had another liner. When it was time to turn the wings, I just lifted the liner out and transferred the wings to the other basket so I could drain the oil out of the first liner. I usually can cook 12 wings but I could only do 8 wings in the liner. These liners clean up easily and they store right in the air fryer. When they arrived they were really squished in the package but I turned them inside out after I washed them and they shaped up nice. I was expecting the dark grey, but not that big of a deal. I also was glad they had no strong smell to them. I wish I knew about these liners sooner. Very happy with this purchase.",
