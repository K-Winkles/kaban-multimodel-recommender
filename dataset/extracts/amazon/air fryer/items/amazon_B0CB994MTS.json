                "reviewText": "We used to have that other big O Showtime rotisserie oven some years ago and ended up throwing it away because I got tired of using it because it was sooooo big and took all the space in the kitchen. Not good. A few years later I craved another rotisserie oven to make some delicious chicken and I looked and looked and did a lot of research and could not find something affordable and nobody really knows how they perform until you actually have one and use it.I found this Maxi Matic oven and I am glad I found it and bought it. For sure is very different then the last toaster oven we had but I like the way it performs. I have noticed right away that the bread gets toasted in a very different way as before. Is not bad, but very different and one thing I like is that the entire slice of bread is toasted evenly. At first you do have to find that fine tuned perfect spot so that the bread is not underdone or over toasted. This unit is very simple to use. No digital nonsense and I like that a lot. It works really well and it is very spacious from the inside yet VERY COMPACT.I have done rotisserie two times and this oven performed much better than what I expected. It is quiet as well. The parts rotate very nicely with plenty of power and it doesn't feel flimsy. I LOVE the tool they provide to remove the cooked chicken and it is really hard to get burnt. This oven/rotisserie does not fit a turkey but a normal size chicken is totally fine and the two times I cooked them they came out delicious, crispy skin and juicy.This is a really good product and I'm really surprised it has very little reviews. I was also very close in trying the Emeral Air Fryer but I personally don't like the way that technology cooks food. I'm really happy with this Maxi Matic oven and I have very little to complain about it.",

                "reviewText": "We have used our Elite Gourmet double French door convection toaster oven (ETO4510B) for about a month now. Overall, we really like it. I would have given it 5 stars except for a couple of minor annoyances.Pros:Being able to control the top and bottom heating elements separately allows for fine-tuning some dishes.There is plenty of room for a couple of pizzas or medium-sized baking pans/stones.The French doors allow you to put move the toaster closer to the edge of the counter. (We have a plastic/vinyl backsplash that can warp if it gets too hot).Cons:The doors don\u2019t stay completely open after you open them all the way and are VERY hot.The shelves are a bit thin. I\u2019m used to thicker gauge wires. If you put a heavy dish on it, you can see it sag. However, you can compensate by putting both racks on the same level or using the drip pan as the shelf.There is no simple switch to turn it on, and the only way to turn the unit on is with the timer. We fear the timer mechanism will be the weak link of this toaster. To help preserve the life of the timer, we don\u2019t turn it backward to turn the toaster off. We turn the heating elements off along with the fan and just let the timer run out on its own.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a small rotisserie. I didn\u2019t want something that was really big and would take up a lot of space. This is the perfect size!I got one of these for myself and for the person that I am a caretaker for. He is unable to use a stove or oven. This oven is large enough for him to easily slide prepared meals on cooking trays in and out without mishaps or burning himself. He can also use a very small pot inside the oven to heat up soup. It has a timer so he always knows when to remove the food. This is the perfect appliance for him and much better than the standard size toaster oven.The rotisserie is amazing. You have to tie up chicken legs if you cook a whole bird to prevent them from expanding and banging around and dragging inside the oven and possibly damaging the rotisserie turner. Not a cow eater, but my friend is. All the meat cooked on the rotisserie is so, so juicy and cooked to perfection.This was one of the best purchases I\u2019ve ever made.",

                "reviewText": "I first used this toaster oven to heat some frozen chicken Kiev. The timer instructions said to tun the dial past 20 and then set to the desired time. Well, the timer refused to allow this. I figured maybe I couldn't turn in back due to the arthritis in my hands, so husband tried and it didn't like him either. So we went to plan B and watched the clock. When the chicken was done, I pulled the shelf out partway and it promptly slid out and dumped the hot chicken onto my lap and then onto the floor (forgot to mention I'm in a wheelchair). The dog ate really well that night, as he doesn't care about the 5-second rule.In short, this oven tries to do too much, and it does none of them well. The doors swing freely and can burn your arm, the large gap between the doors lets hot air blow out, the wire rack is much too flimsy, and the rack supports allow the rack to tilt down and deposit the food on the floor (most users) or in your lap (me). It is way too large for toasting a couple pieces of bread,. We didn't try making anything else lest it sent us to the ER (probably on a weekend). I sent it back and have not had any arguments with its much more cooperative Breville replacement. The Breville has not tried to kill us, either.",

But I have an air fryer that works fine, so I kept that instead of gifting it, as I had planned.But THIS little beauty...mostly used for a small overn for nachos...lots of nachos! My daughter's new favorite snack is nachos!Then, I used the rotisserie function for an eye roast roast...HOLY COW! Absolutely THEE BEST roast beef I have ever made!!! I mean, not to toot my own horn, but toot toot, I'm pretty great in the kitchen. BUT, the rotisserie action means that it cooked evenly all the way around, with no more done spots! It was AMAZING!!!! Oh, and super easy to clean-idk what these other people are talking about.LOVE THIS THING! I can hardly wait to use it again and again!!!",

                "reviewText": "After searching through several different ovens I chose this one hoping that it would be the perfect one. Now that I have used it for a few months I can realistically give an honest opinion. The concept and the intention were a great idea and the design and size are fabulous as I love the french doors, but it ends there. The materials/metals that were used are horribly cheap and extremely below standard. The inner walls are a crappy metal with a finish that you can not even get clean I tried a few products to no avail it does not come clean. After using the rotisserie a few times as we love chicken done this way it is like the residue literally embeds into the metal and will not come off not even with a degreaser and if you try a scouring pad it makes it worse. The walls are so flimsy from not being enforced or braced properly the very thin racks collapse with any kind of weight put on them. There is no way you are putting a large chicken let alone a turkey to cook in there. Needless to say I could go on with more, but alas I feel awful for the people that purchased these ovens also for me after spending this kind of money as I know it will be going in the garbage. I will update and provide pictures of proof as soon as I can I need to change my phone as my camera has stopped working.",
