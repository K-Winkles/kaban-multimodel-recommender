I bought paper liners but don\u2019t really think I needed them. Basket is very non-stick. If you want to cook more than 1-2 small portions at a time, get a bigger machine as this has a heating compartment that\u2019s only about 5\u201d square\u2026..not roomy, but good quality. I\u2019m happy with this purchase.",

My wife was skeptical about using using it, but after learning all the things you can make in it, it's earned a permanent spot on the counter. In the last 4 months we have used it around 3 or 4 times per week. It's easy to use and to wash. Foods come out really good and fast. People said to spray olive oil on foods, but after trying it, I've found most food comes out better without any oil. This little fryer is a great addition to our kitchen and I'd highly recommend it.",
