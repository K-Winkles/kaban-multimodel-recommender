                "reviewText": "This is a great air fryer. It's big enough to cook a decent amount of food in a single session and still takes up a small amount of counter space.Because it's simple to use, my teenagers are actually using this instead of the microwave. Everybody in the house (except me) loves the preheat feature. They say it makes fries more crispy and food generally better. They are probably right, but I go without because it heats up quickly and still produces nice food.About the only thing I would change is cleaning. It's not extremely easy to clean. Stuff sticks to the surface more than I think it should. That said, it's not super difficult either. Some of my family members have air fryers, as well, and I just think theirs are easier to clean. That said, this has more features and a generous amount of space for cooking larger items. Overall, I'm still happy with this one, and I'd take it over the others that my family members have 10 out of 10 times.Note: We've owned this for a little less than a year, and we've had exactly zero issues. We use it almost every day...often several times a day. So far, a durable little machine.",

                "reviewText": "I am very honest in my reviews because I like hearing about products as they help me make choices. First, this product is well made and attractive in the kitchen. It is large so you don't expect a compact item. I love the ease of cleaning this air fryer. I wipe down the inside after using to make sure it stays easy to clean. I just soak water in the basket with some soap and it comes clean easily after soaking. I fit alot of food in there or a little. I bought a rack set on Amazon to have space for doubling food quantity. I love all the preprogrammed food settings and the bake function as well. So much functionality for an air fryer. I highly recommend this air fryer. The one thing I caution is for those who do not want a large fryer as it does take up room on the counter but for those who have the space, it is definitely worth purchasing.",

A few complaints:after about 18 months of use two of the four rubber feet for the tray have broken off and it already looks like the other two aren't long for this world.The tray isn't too difficult to clean but the dishwasher does NOT do as good of a job on it than just doing it by hand, or even tossing a pod in and letting it soak.I REALLY wish the preset buttons were programmable.Be careful where you put the air fryer. I put up a heat shield behind it so it wouldn't damage the paint.It's really convenient and works much better than a microwave. Air-frying a leftover burrito or pizza has been eye-opening.One more thing, don't use regular spray oil. the aerosol agent could damage the lining of the air fryer. I use a spray bottle filled with avocado oil for it's high smoke point when I need to use oil.",

Highly suggest getting silicon liners for this product to prolong its basket and liner use. So far I'm enjoying my air fryer. I use it every day. Recommend cleaning after every use. The basket liner does wear out after about 6 months of constant use.",

Creates a little more cooking smell than the 4 quart variety of the same brand, and is noisier. I have both, as one complements the other in the event of cooking multiple things.

I did run it outside for an hour to get rid of plastic smell, so bear that in mind. The size at 7 qt is amazing, can cook a whole chicken.My test for all fryers is homemade fries\u2014the ones I\u2019ve made in this Gourmia are hands down the best vs the other brands noted above. But that is subjective based on your tastes.I wholeheartedly recommend this fryer, especially if you can snag it on sale. If mine ever breaks, I would definitely buy same model.",
