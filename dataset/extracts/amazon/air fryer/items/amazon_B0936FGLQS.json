I\u2019ve used it several times already and have really enjoyed the convenience, speed, and the healthy food that it efficiently cooks. This particular air fryer, the Corsori Pro LE 5 quart is very nice looking and full of nice features. I really like its sleek modern design, the touch panel functionality, its compactness, and also how quietly it operates. In addition, it\u2019s super easy to use and to clean. I\u2019ve heard that the Cosori customer support is very good as well, which is a nice bonus and that, unfortunately, tends to be a rare thing these days. Hopefully I don\u2019t need to contact them anytime soon though. In the mean time, I\u2019ll continue to use and enjoy my new favorite kitchen appliance.",

                "reviewText": "We recently bought this airfryer, it had been on our list for the longest and we finally got our hands on this. It is a quick & a easy method to eat \"fried\" foods without feeling guilty. All the dishes that come out of this are always delicious and crispy and it is very easy to use compared to baking or frying.Design - It may be small for larger families but its compact size is perfect for me and my partner, always does not take up a lot of the counter space. Its a sleek design which is stainless steel and we got the grey/black color.Usage - It is quite easy to use, it already has pre set functions for temperatures & times for some items, which makes it convenient to use. The display is big enough to see how much time is remaining for an item to be cooked, etc.Cleaning - The cleaning of the air-fryer is what held me not buying one for the longest time, but with this air fryer we don't have to worry about that. The basket and the tray inside are easy to clean and are dishwasher friendly and the food barely ever sticks to the bottom, making it very smooth to just pop in to the dishwasher.Overall, this is a great product for the price its at, it has even made baking and reheating foods so much easier for us! It is a fantastic investment for those looking for quick cooking without having to use too much oil/butter on their dishes. A great addition to the kitchen!",

Works quickly and doesn't heat up the house which is great in the summer. Crips up food without oil. Easy to clean and I think is even saving me on electricity. Overall a great purchase. I just wish I had bought a larger one than the 5qt so it as easier to cook for 3 or 4 people.",

So, I decided to try this one, and bought the five quart because there's only two of us, and I wasn't going to cook that much in it.Because I wasn't sure about using an air fryer, I bought a used one from the Amazon Warehouse. That way, I wouldn't feel like I had wasted a lot of money if it didn't get used. When we did a test run with this one, there was very little odor, which was a relief. Also, the controls are very easy to use, and I like the fact that the basket is dishwasher safe.We haven't used it a lot, yet, but we did do the following:1. Bacon--Turned out just right.2. Frozen onion rings--Came out nice a crispy.3. Frozen French fries--Cooked in no time, and turned out great, even without shaking.4. French fries warmed up--Did a great job.5. Poached eggs--Total failure. Tried three different times at different temps, and never got them to turn out right.I kind of wish we had gotten at least the six quart, because the five quart doesn't hold much at all. It held about five onion rings, so we had to cook twice in order to get enough for both of us. However, we're going to stick with this until we're able to get a combo toaster/convection/air fryer oven where we'll have more room to play with.Other than it being kind of small, this air fryer meets our needs at present, and I'm looking forward to experimenting with more things, such as baking some cookies, and cooking hamburgers. I'm very happy with this air fryer, and I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Picked this up on a black friday sale, had been ruminating over getting one of these for a while and decided to go for it. So far I've used it to cook chicken, hash browns, fries, onion rings, Jamaican patties, reheated pizza and a few other quick items. This air fryer has handled all of these things well, it's also fairly intuitive to pick the time and the temp and get things moving... it heats up fast and gets the job done in a decent amount of time. It's somewhere between microwave and oven as far as timing on things. This particular fryer has a decent amount of space and is very easy to clean.Overall I'm glad I picked this up, and it's pretty easy to recommend... only negative thing for some folks might be that it takes up a bit of counter space, so that's maybe something to keep in mind. Otherwise, if you're like me and sort of on the fence, take the plunge and give it a try, I'm willing to bet you'll end up using it more than you initially think you will.Update: It has been about 2 months since my purchase, and at this stage I really don't find myself using my oven or even my microwave as often as I did before the air fryer, especially for heating stuff up, this air fryer has become a pretty essential kitchen utility. Easy to recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I had a Tefal air fryer which was fairly limited in what it could do as it had a paddle but we used it quite often for about the last 7 years or more. However the energy crisis and the fact that our oven has packed up simply had me looking around for a new air fryer. I did my research and realised I didn't need a ninja so anything with a good review will do. The Instant pot was out of stock and by chance the Cosori popped up and after checking couple of reviews and online videos I opted for the Cosori as it's sleek design also caught my eye along with the excellent feedback as well as the FB community pages packed with recipes. Their 2 year warranty was reassuring as I had never heard of this brand. I ordered and it arrived within 2 days which was a surprise but most welcome.I must say it's an absolute gem so far as it cooks food in half the the time of my old Tefal pad airfryer. I did some chicken thighs in about 14mins (10 min press and I added 4 to brown it a bit more). I cooked some sausages from frozen in 10 mins and added an extra 3 mins to get them brown). This morning I boiled some eggs in 10 mins so no steamy kitchen and no need to watch the pot.The glass tempered screen on the top is clear and pretty idiot proof imho but some may think differently. The presets can be amended as you can alter the temperature and the time which is excellent so there's plenty of flexibility.The overall design is very pleasing to the eye and differs from the usual Air fryer styles which are a bit ugly but that's just me.The tray is nice and solid and fits nice and easy without any fuss. The fact that the pan is square is a bonus especially when cooking a joint. Also cleaning it it with a sponge and soap and water is a 2 minute job so no hassle there.The preheat is 4 mins but you can alter it so not really a problem but you can go manual and not bother with a preheat.I will be cooking a couple of rump steaks later tonight so I may report back on how it went. I followed an online recipe and ignored the preset so it cooked a much lower temperature and for longer. FOLLOWUP: The steak looked and tasted great however next time I will try the preset which a higher temperature was only 6 mins.I will be putting it to the test with a whole chicken come the weekend so wish me luck! FOLLOW UP: The medium chicken from Aldi fitted nicely in the tray and after seasoning I gave it 60 mins in the Cosori with a turnover after 30 mins. I think I could have gotten away with 45 mins but I wanted to be sure it was cooked. The chicken tasted great nice and soft and juicy and the missus said it was the best meal I\u2019ve made her.Next on my list is a leg of lamb. FOLLOW UP: The 1.5 kg leg of lamb fitted nicely in the tray as I looked for a more square piece with less bone. After defrosting it I seasoned it with 2 tablespoons of oil, salt and pepper, garlic powder and mixed herbs. I left it covered for a few hours in the fridge. And took it out an hour prior to cooking to get it to room temperature. I set it at 180c for 20mins then turned it over and gave it another 40 mins. I like it well done and checked it with a knife. I let it rest for 10-15mins and served it with steamed veggies. The missus gave me 10/10 as it was well cooked, tender and juicy. Another great result and it seems I\u2019m now cooking every Sunday.it comes with a 2 year warranty, manual, recipe book and access to the app which has more recipes in it. Also there's a FB community and oodles of recipes online.Overall for the price you will not be disappointed as I certainly wasn't.When it's back in stock buy it!",

Al decidir comprar una de nuevo por el ahorro de tiempo y de electricidad respecto a un horno, optamos por la de 4.7L dudando un poco por la diferencia de volumen, pero la decisi\u00f3n fue la correcta:- Mucho m\u00e1s bonita y l\u00edmpia por fuera: el cristal templado es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil y agradecido de limpiar.- Mucho m\u00e1s silenciosa (pero mucho).- M\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de limpiar: la rejilla escurridora se quita (y se puede cocinar sin ella), y es much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de limpiar y menos aparatosa.- Menos opciones, pero m\u00e1s \u00fatiles: tiene menos programas (9 vs 11), pero los que han quitado son programas que jam\u00e1s us\u00e9 con la de 5.5L, y adem\u00e1s esta tiene funci\u00f3n Shake manual: es decir, puedes indicar t\u00fa si quieres o no quieres el Shake, mientras que con la de 5.5L ten\u00edas que elegir un programa que ya lo llevara y cambiar la temperatura y tiempo despu\u00e9s.- M\u00e1s intuitiva y m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de usar: puedes cambiar de temperatura y tiempo sin necesidad de tener que alternar entre uno y otro, y no hace falta \"pausar y reanudar\" si los cambias en mitad del cocinado.- Consume menos, pero llega a m\u00e1s temperatura (230\u00baC vs 205\u00baC).- No hay tanta diferencia de volumen de cocinado: a pesar de que tiene menos capacidad, la rejilla de la de 5.5L quita mucho espacio, con lo que al final te cabe *casi* la misma comida.En general, estamos much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s contentos con esta, y desde luego es una buena inversi\u00f3n con el tiempo y la electricidad que te ahorras.",
