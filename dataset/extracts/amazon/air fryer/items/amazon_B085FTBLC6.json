It does a great job heating up French fries and doing things like crisping Brussels sprouts. The blue color is also very stylish and fits in great in our kitchen. Note that even though this isn't the XL version, it's still chonky; make sure you measure your counter space to ensure there is adequate room. I have even baked bread in it with very good results.Pros:- Heats up very fast- Very even heat, makes great toast- Multiple shelf positions help getting good results.- Air fry basket is really convenient for multiple uses.- The \"Super Convection\" setting is very useful to get even cooking.- Lots of cooking modes/settings- Very well insulated, does not radiate a lot of heat.- Quiet, even with convection runningCons:- It's very big- Lots of accessories that you will need to find a place for- Toast \"shade\" controls aren't great at predicting toast results.",

Intuitive to use. And the cooking - on every function - just is perfect. I haven\u2019t had an issue with anything I\u2019ve tried to cool.My only two negatives - and they are small. I wish the light stayed on a bit longer (or a way you can keep it on) - and it can be a bit loud at startup - but that goes away quickly.Stop wasting your money on inferior products - and just get this one!",

                "reviewText": "We just received ours a few days ago and finally tried it out last night and today. Frozen pizza was up first. The instruction manual is very thorough and well written with clear instructions. It's really easy to set the appropriate function, time and temperature, if not quite intuitive. I can see the learning curve will be very quick. The pizza was evenly baked, the crust was nice and crispy and the toppings were perfectly heated & melted - even with us having added extra toppings of our own. Today, we had to try frozen French fries with the airfry setting and the reheat function for our leftover pizza. Again, it was really easy, I love how the panel clearly shows preheat and how the alert sounds are different for both preheat alert and cooking timer. The fries didn't brown, but were perfectly crispy. The reheat function also worked beautifully. I could have set the time for slightly less time, but again, thenpizza was still crispy, without being overcooked and everything was uniformly reheated. I have some chicken thawing now so I can try air frying it for dinner. I can hardly wait to see how that turns out. We've been toaster oven users for years, we just prefer having the additional functionality and use it for so many things. This appliance is attractive, works well and we are very impressed so far.",

The controls are easy and very intuitive, and I am surprised at how quiet it is. It preheats quickly, cooks evenly, and is simply great to use. I'm happy that I won't need to use my big ovens as much, especially during the summer. There are lots of this kind of oven out there that cost less, but this one is worth every penny.",

                "reviewText": "Fits on my counter; use it for air frying, toasting, pizza, and baking. Takes a bit to figure out ideal length of time - trial and error; rule of thumb - begin by using 20 percent less time than what food packaging says as it's compact and runs hot - then check to see if it requires more time. First few attempts I overcooked pizza, fries, and a few other food products not utilizing this methodology. Dials are easy to use and time/temp can be changed quickly (when warm up beep sounds timer begins immediately, but can readjust time once food is inserted into oven). Sounds off when finished - a little loud. Overall, high quality metal product. Includes several handy trays - accessories for various cooking types. I also purchased a Breville cookbook containing various scrumptious recipes. Use a lot with safe silicone baking dishes and mats - although they're hot when removed from oven - utilize gloves or other protection.",

I'm so pleased with this. On top of it all, the red is a lovely color and the things looks swanky in my kitchen.",

It also replaces my conventional oven in several tasks which is much more practical, the circulation of hot air cooks at the same time. perfects foods like chicken or beef without any problem and leaves the meat tender and delicious. It can be used as a slow cooker or dehydrator, additional functions which are a plus.I also use it for frozen pizza, you know like me how hard it is to cook the pizza evenly when it is frozen and of course the bottom rack on the plate which is included and the pizza setting it cooks evenly perfect way if not better than a large ovenThe LCD dial is very simple and the buttons are user-friendly and well thought out another big plus.Many people talk about the sound it emits like in the video, I don't think it's that bad",
