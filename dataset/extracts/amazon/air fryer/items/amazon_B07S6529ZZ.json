The food comes out PERFECT every time AND we save so much on dishes. This is super easy to clean up, you can just wipe it out or put it in the dishwasher. There are so many different functions and this has actually REPLACED many of our other kitchen appliances! I recently discovered it makes perfect toast so I was able to toss are toaster which made me so happy because I hated the toaster crumbs! Well worth the money and definitely the only appliance I need!",

Steaks, pork, and even chicken thighs and wings come out so juicy and delicious. One thing I will say is, the basket is a bit on the small side, and squeezing in two big cuts of meat is a bit of a puzzle. But, hey, I make it work.My only hiccup is figuring out the right cooking time for stuff. The \"Air Fry\" and \"Air Roast\" settings are awesome, but nailing the perfect time is a bit of a trial and error dance, but its not that big of a deal. Overall, though, this air fryer is a game-changer and must for every kitchen, especially if you meal prep or want things cooked on a more \"healthier\" level.",

                "reviewText": "We just received our Ninja Air Fryer (AF) today. Woot!! After researching, watching YouTubes on AF\u2019s & combo AF\u2019s & toaster ovens we decided to go with a straight Air Fryer. So glad we did!Smell: Many of the reviews commented on the smell when first running. We put ours on the patio & ran it about 1-1/2 hours going thru the different settings. It did have a smell which my husband related to a new car engine smell. Smile! It smells like plastic.Bird: We have a pet ring neck dove, Buddy, so we wanted a safe AF without Teflon. We were assured the basket & plate are ceramic. The plate does come out of the basket.Cleaning: It does clean up nice & quick. We hand washed to protect the ceramic coating.Testing/Cooking: Hubby did fish sticks & he was so happy! Crisper than the oven!! He followed the directions on the Trident fish stick bag. These are from Costco. In sale now.So\u2026 I eat low carb but had to try a bite of that crispy fish & it was truly crispy & tasty!Without a recipe I jumped right in & used the AF button to air fry a bell pepper seeded & cut in half. I added cut up turkey & turkey bacon & tomato & did the AF button for a few minutes. I believe that defaults to 390 degrees. Don\u2019t quote me. \ud83d\ude31 Did that for 2-3 minutes. All the while checking to make sure not burning. NOTE: When you pull out the basket it continues to run unless you pause & then hit start again. Also, it doesn\u2019t beep half way thru for you to shake or stir. Next I added fresh Parmesan cheese. Yummo. The exciting thing is I just threw a good amount in there & it spilled onto the basket along with the tomato. Cooked on AF & it browned!! Yay, nothing stuck & it cleaned up beautifully. I just didn\u2019t want to baby it, you know.Time & Temp: These can be adjusted while it\u2019s running. No need to pause it. I adjusted the time or temp & with a small delay it changed over & kept going without a hiccup.Heat: The top is not not but the back has some heat. The handle is fine to touch. The sides & front are a bit warm. I would move fresh veggies off the counter when using this as the area does get a bit warm but not like the stove! I believe this will be great to use in the summer PLUS you can make meals fresh daily at a moments notice.Basket: I believe this is around 8-1/4\u201d. Not huge but not small either. It is round. We would have liked it to be square but this is great.ENJOY shopping & learning about this Ninja. I hope this review helps.We would recommend this addition to your family. Smile!Blessings. \ud83c\udf38\ud83e\udd51\ud83c\udf38\ud83e\udd51\ud83c\udf38",

                "reviewText": "This fryer has a sleek design. The features are easy to use. Food is cooked faster. I have had success with almost many thing i cook. The only thing that did not work for me was my fried chicken. It did not color the chicken evenly. The time needed to fully brown it was too long for chicken meat. You don\u2019t want dried out chicken tenders. But that is only one item. An item that freaky needs to be cooked in oil. French fries, tater tots, homemade biscuits, cake, bread, and so much more work great in this air fryer. You will have to adjust to the cooking times. In some cases you will have to experiment with times and in some cases mode. I couldn\u2019t be happier with it. You can cook multiple ideas in it at one time. It does make cooking easier. I would buy it again. It does have a small cooking area, but that area can hole a lot of food. Works great. 10/10",

So far everything that I've fried in the unit has come out tasty and well cooked. Have tried chicken wings and thighs, pork chops and pork loin, different cuts of steak, french fries, spring rolls and more.......Easy to clean, which is a big plus.",
