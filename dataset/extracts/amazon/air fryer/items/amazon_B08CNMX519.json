                "reviewText": "Ordered this to replace another brand of air fryer/toaster oven that died after 9 months. So far, after 4 days, this oven is working as expected. I did have to make adjustments to the time and temperature when making toast, and I lower the temp when air frying. Using the oven for various tasks is very easy and pretty much intuitive.So far, I\u2019ve made toast, lamb chops, chicken wings, chicken parm, meatloaf with baked potatoes, and roasted veggies. The longest the oven has run is 45 minutes at 350, then 10 mins at 425 and none of the outside surfaces got too extremely hot.When on Air Fry, this oven is a bit noisier than my other oven. It\u2019s not bad, but you can definitely tell it\u2019s on. The oven doesn\u2019t get overly hot when it\u2019s working, but I have it set on a heat-resistant counter protecter and I have another protecter placed behind the oven to protect the wall. I also wrapped the wire in several layers of aluminum foil to protect it from any heat from the back.It\u2019s easy to clean the inside. I wipe it down with a mix of water, white vinegar, and a little bit of Dawn dishwashing soap. I wash the air fry basket and oven rack by hand, and I covered the baking pan with foil to protect it and make clean up easier.My only complaints (and these are not really complaints, more like mild annoyances) are that 1) the crumb tray is just slightly wider than a regular size piece of aluminum foil, so if you want to completely line the tray, you need two pieces of foil. And, 2) the rack has a tendency to pitch forward if you pull it too far out of the oven, so you need to be mindful of that when checking food temps, etc., while cooking.So\u2026so far, so good. I did purchase the optional warranty, just in case this one dies after a while. Thankfully, I had that on the other oven. Fingers crossed I won\u2019t need it on this one.",

IT did not fit a pizza in it and could not fit a casserole 13 inches long.You spend $30 more for the Oster Air Fryer Oven, 10-in-1 Countertop Toaster Oven Air and you get a larger more useful product that fits pizzas and a large casserole.",

I followed the instructions and also the advice of some people in the reviews, when I first set it up I let it run for 30 min at 400\u00b0 to get rid of the burn smell. The first thing I made was chicken wings, using the provided manual I cooked them at 400\u00b0 for 25 minutes and they came out so golden and crispy I could not believe it!! It was easy to use and easy to clean. Would definitely recommend !",

I like it overall but it\u2019s really starting to worry me, like it may have some kind of circuit issue. I am really ticked off at how much money I\u2019ve spent only to have it start having issues so quickly.",
