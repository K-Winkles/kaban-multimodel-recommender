This product is an excellent choice for both young and old people who may not have experience with cooking or are looking for a safe and easy way to prepare meals.The one-touch digital controls are straightforward to use, allowing you to select from the seven cooking functions with ease. The oven has a wide temperature range of 50\u00b0- 400\u00b0F, providing plenty of versatility for various cooking styles and recipes.The 7.25-Qt capacity of the oven is spacious enough to cook large meals or multiple items at once, making it ideal for family gatherings or meal prepping. The oven's compact size also makes it a great choice for small kitchens or apartments where space is limited.What I appreciate most about the Nuwave Brio 7-in-1 Air Fryer Oven is its safety features. The oven is designed with an automatic shut-off function, ensuring that it turns off when the cooking cycle is complete. The oven's interior is also easy to clean, with a non-stick coating that prevents food from sticking and makes it simple to wipe clean.Overall, I highly recommend the Nuwave Brio 7-in-1 Air Fryer Oven to anyone looking for an easy and safe way to cook meals. The product is well-made, durable, and offers excellent value for the price. With its simple controls and versatile cooking functions, this air fryer oven is a must-have for anyone who wants to enjoy delicious and healthy meals with ease.",

                "reviewText": "I have the 7.25 quart Nuwave Brio and I'm a carnivore. Using this air fryer is so much easier than using a stove-top grill, conventional oven or skillet. With experimentation, I found that I don't have to use the 'Sear' function to get a delicious seared outside on my steaks. The probe (go by the instructions in the booklet) allows the fryer to cook to perfection. And yes, a probe is supposed to come with the fryer. Make sure to search the box before throwing it out. To answer some of the questions that I read prior to purchasing: 1) the 7.25 qt cooks a whole chicken and there's a probe temperature guide for a whole chicken in the booklet. 2) It can start to cook at a later time for the hour that you program it. 3) Silicone bottom covering is better than parchment because you can preheat with silicone but not with parchment, as the parchment during preheat can fly up to the heating elements and catch fire. Even though people say it's safe to use parchment in an air fryer, there's a fire hazard with that that I would rather not have to worry about. 4) someone said that popcorn can be popped in an air fryer. I wouldn't do it, because the kernels can shoot through the heating elements and also scratch the non-stick coating of the pan. 5) make sure the drawer (pan) is closed completely so that it is perfectly flush with the fryer unit. It takes a firm push. Otherwise it won't start to cook. 6) to stop the beeping sound when using the console, after turning on the 'power' button, press 'sear' and 'stage' buttons simultaneously. That has to be done each time the fryer is turned on.",

                "reviewText": "Just received this product so exited to use it because my old one was too small and needed a bigger air fryer. I cooked some wings it trying to adjust the best time it. Then cooked another set of wings, set it for 25 minutes I noticed I didn't hear it and saw it was shut off try to turn it back on but it wouldn't so I noticed to was really hot so I put the food in the oven instead to let it cool down while unplugged after an hour it still wouldn't turn such a major bummer after just receiving it today it blows out hope to get it replaced if not then refunded because I'm not keeping anything that I can't use until then 1 \u2b50Update: They sent me a replacement the same day I sent the other back to Kohl's returns. Got the new one within 3 days. After a couple of months works great so far\ud83d\udc4d",

This took some getting used to because it has many, many preset options, all are great by the way.However, if you want to reheat something for 5 mins I suggest pressing Start, this will actually start cooking at a preset temp and time (360 for 15 mins) however, you can change the time and temp which is great for quick warm ups instead of looking for the menu options.Overall this is very good and great value.",
