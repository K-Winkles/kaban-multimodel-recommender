The capacity and additional accessories are a big plus. Must read the manual to enjoy. Overall ok. Flave to food a decent. Making Crunchy pork bits leave it to be desired. For the price, functions as expected. Not perfect but easy and great cooking.",

                "reviewText": "I extensively researched the more spendy oven-like air fryers and hated that most seemed to smoke or break down after a year or less. I wanted to improve my cooking health and saw the reviews here and decided this price was acceptable if it broke after a year. I am extremely pleased with the results of this. I used to hate making fish. With this, spice your fish put it in and hit the button for fish. It doesn't matter if it's cod, salmon, or trout. They all come out crispy on the outside, juicy inside, and cooked perfectly! The same is said of chicken, whether a breast or a quarter piece. I just did a roast in this. Again amazed! In 30 minutes, I had a perfectly cooked medium-rare roast. Frozen tater tots, no oil, and cooked in 15 minutes! I love not taking 20 to 30 minutes to heat up the oven, plus the cooking time. I love this thing; it has positively changed my life.",

Ost like a rectangle with rounded edges. Kind of a squared oval maybe. Hard to describe. But it\u2019s perfect.

Philips seemed to dry out the food too much for my liking. Returned the Philips and purchased this one. I have had it for 1year now, and I use it every day. In the past year I have only used my full size over twice. My very first air fryer was the NuWave brand, but it stopped working after 6 months, and was very hard to clean. This GoWise brand is much easier to clean, performs well, produces great quality food, pretty quiet operation, comes with a lot of great accessories, and is very nice looking. Although, I must say the material used in the Philips air fryer was by far the easiest one to clean. I have not needed to use many of the accessories that came with the unit. However, I have used the pizza pan about 5 times. The pizza pan has lost its coating over time even with me only hand washing it. I would still highly recommend this air fryer over other brands.",

                "reviewText": "I love this thing! It's super easy to use & clean - not to mention it cuts cooking time in half. I've never been able to make chicken as tender, juicy and with so much flavor before. There are TONS of air fryer recipes out there that I've finally been able to plan & make meals that even my picky kids will eat that are also so much healthier than using a deep fryer.I bought this as a first-time air fryer user, so I was solely dependent on reviews and didn't want to spend a ton on something I wasn't sure I was going to use. When I stumbled on this one, the price was great and was highly recommended.Since I haven't used any other air fryer and am still learning all of its features, I can only comment on this particular product but I will say as a family of 4, I do wish I got the bigger size since you can't overcrowd the pan in order to cook everything evenly. So, depending on the size of food & people you are cooking for, it may take several batches to complete. That being said, with the decease in cook time its usually not that big of a deal & the outcome is well worth the wait.So far, it's been perfect for us & highly recommend to those on the fence about purchasing one.",
