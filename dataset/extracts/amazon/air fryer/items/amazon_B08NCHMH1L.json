                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great little air fryer",
                "reviewText": "I've been wanting a small air fryer for an upcoming car-camping trip. So I experimented with our large one for the last few weeks making chicken wings. It went so well, that I decided to pull the trigger on this one.Breaking It In:First concern was the plastic-y smell. The instructions say to wash the bowl and tray with warm soapy water before first use. But the silicone feet on the tray still smelled. The manual says to run it at full heat for 15 min. to burn off the heating element coating from the manufacturing process. After 30 min., I could still smell it. So I did another 30 min. and that seemed to take care of it.First Test Run:I divided some large chicken wings into two pieces, (1) the drumette, and (2) the outer two sections of the wing. I could fit two pieces of the outer two sections plus a drumette, or two drumettes plug an outer wing. That's a decent amount for a single person who is eating other things along with the wings. Being the smallest air fryer out there, that seems reasonable. The manual said to cook at 395 degrees (the highest temperature setting) for 20-24 minutes for chicken wings. I did two runs of 12 min so I could turn them and season the second side in the middle of the run. They weren't quite as crispy as I like, so I did a little more time. They turned out pretty good, but I'll do 15 minutes per side next time. To be fair, the manual does say that it takes 3 min to \"preheat\" so you should add that time when starting out \"cold,\" which is how I started.Ease of use:It could hardly be simpler to use. Plug it in. Load it up. Set the temp using the top dial. Set the timer using the front dial and it starts cooking. Come back when it goes \"ding.\" It's Teflon coated, so it pretty much wipes clean with a paper towel.Power Consumption:I ran this first test run through a kill-a-watt type meter and measured the power usage since I'll be using it from an EcoFlow Delta Mini power station. The power station puts out 1400W maximum and has an 880Wh energy capacity in the batteries. The specs for this air fryer say it uses 1000W. Indeed, I found that when the heating element is on, it draws between 950-1000W. The fan alone uses 15W. My chicken wing test run was at the highest temp setting, 395 degrees, and the heating element turned on for about 30 seconds every two minutes, for a \"duty cycle\" of about 25%. Considering that was pretty much the maximum amount of chicken that would fit below the \"max\" line in the bowl, I think that's probably the most power-hungry the thing will be. When the heating element would kick on, the power draw would be 997W, and would slowly drop to about 950W over the 30 or so seconds it was on. Then the power would drop down to 15W (the circulation fan only) for one and a half minutes before the heat would kick back on. Overall, the power draw was about 6Wh per minute. So, 6Wh/min x 30 min = 180Wh to cook my 1.5 chicken wings. That's less than 1/4 of my power station's available energy. That would be replaced during a couple of hours of driving, or an hour of solar (if I'm stationary for a while), so I think that is quite workable.Second Test Run:I decided to test it from the power station that I bought it to use with (I had photos for each step, but it looks like the site scrambles the picture order). I loaded it up with two wing drumettes and an outer wing. Sprinkled it with Montreal Chicken Seasoning and drizzled on some Hot Buffalo sauce. I decided to run at 395 degrees for 15 + 15 min. At first, it started drawing 1007W from the station in the preheating phase. Power draw dropped slowly to about 980W by the end of the preheat. It drew about 18W from the power station when only the fan was running. After the first 15 min run. Pieces flipped and seasoning applied to second side. After the initial preheat, the max power draw was 999W at the start of subsequent heating cycles. After the second 15 min cooking session. The combined 30 minutes of run time consumed 22% (started at 44% and ended at 22% state of charge) of the battery in the power station. That was 880Wh X 22% = 194 Wh of energy. The bowl before cleaning. The bowl was mostly clean after wiping with a paper towel. It cleaned up fairly easily with soap and water the rest of the way.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the 1.1 quart air fryer for my wife to make chicken and fries for herself. The shape and small size of the unit makes it easy to fit on the kitchen counter. This air fryer works as expected with crispy fried chicken and fries. Very easy to use and clean. As mentioned in the instructions, there is a smell when the unit is first used. This is normal. It took four uses at the highest setting for the smell to go away. I have no complaints about this 1.1 quart air fryer. However, in hindsight, I wish I got a larger air fryer so that my wife could cook a piece of chicken AND fries at the same time. The 1.1 quart is only good for small portions of only one item at a time. But, a very nice unit for what it is designed for!",

It cooks thoroughly and quicker than any other way. The food comes out nice and crisp the way you want fried food to be - without any oil! Read and follow the directions. Warm it up for 10 minutes before putting food in to cook.",

                "reviewText": "This is our second air fryer and we love it! The first one, a Holsem, only lasted a week or less (three uses) and the heat quit. I returned it to Amazon and bought this one. So far, we like the Elite much better than the other brand. This one is far easier to pick up the basket as it just lifts out! That's it. No locks, no little plastic slide thingys to break, you just literally open the top and lift the basket up. It's also larger and the pan that sits underneath the basket is easier to lift out and clean. I was afraid that, since the lid lifts up to look at your food or lift the basket out, it would be \"tippy\" but it isn't at all! There are little suction cups on the bottom of the air fryer that stick to the counter just from the weight of the fryer itself. They work great and, frankly, I doubt the lid would make the thing tip even if the suction cups weren't there. It seems very sturdy and it took me very little time to get used to lifting the lid and then pulling the catch up to close it. I've had zero trouble with it and highly recommend it. It's also super easy to clean. I just wipe it out for fries and onion rings because nothing sticks. This fryer is also easier to see the digital readout than the Holsem was. I'm 5'6\" and I had to get really close and almost stand on my tiptoes to read the Holsem as our counters are a tad higher than some. This Elite has the digital readout on the top front which is a lot better. We love it!!",

There is no way you can fit more than one food item in this air fryer. I tried to cook a regular size steak and I hade cut the steak in half to fit it inside the basket. And the steak was still to big! This will made cooking my steak much longer So if you intentions for using this air fryer for children size items or light snacks it would work well. Dont expect this air fryer to work for a cooking more than one thing a time.",

I used it for plantains, yucca, sausages, eggs, dumplings, fried fish quite successfully..not so good with toast or croissants though. You also have to turn things over (not eggs). I bought it in july to save counter space. I have a big boss air fryer and I am too lazy to take things in and out of the cupboard. So, about 9 weeks later it stopped working! I was in the middle of cooking, put some chicken in and returned 20 mins later and found out that this thing was not working! I made sure that the door was flushed closed, I cleaned and cleaned the unit again, checking for debri, I changed the power supply - and still not working! Too late to return. I guess I had a rental for $35.99. Still mad. Had to go back to big boss. Will try another brand. I do want a smaller one. Other reviewers said this happened with them. Should have listened. If you want a temp one, by all means, buy it.",
