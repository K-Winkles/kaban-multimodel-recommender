So I decided to try these out. I've only used them twice, but they work great for really wet items and to cook liquids. I still prefer the parchment liners when I can use them, since they completely save me the time of ANY washing, but these aren't too hard to wash, just that you do have to wash them after each use. Yeah, I'm pretty lazy. So what?",
