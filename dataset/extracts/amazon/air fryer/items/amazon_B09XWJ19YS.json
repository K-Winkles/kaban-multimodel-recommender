Took a minute to adjust to how well the convection feature helps speed the cooking process, but it's easy to use and does everything I need it to. Baked potatoes in 20-30 minutes, reheating food, making crispy cauliflower, and of course toasting bread if you need to.",

This product is so much better than firing up the oven. Easy, quick and efficient cooking. Enjoying it completely.",
