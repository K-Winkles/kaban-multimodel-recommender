                "reviewText": "After 1 week review:i bought this machine to cook fast fat free french fries. From start to table takes about 20 minutes for the first batch, (5 for preheat, 15 for cooking). The controls are easy to learn and use. With plain potatoes (no coatings or spices) There is virtually no cleanup. I use fresh russet potatoes that i cut into a 1/4x1/4 cross section, rinse with cold water, dry in a salad spinner before adding to the air fryer.Sometimes i remove the basket halfway through and give it a shake, then replace it, sometimes not. If i want browner fries i extend the time a minute or two past the 15 minute preset the \"french fry button sets. Easy peasy! i do not use liners for this. the fries come out crispy on the outside and creamy inside.I am satisfied.Ive started experimenting with other vegetables but do not have enough experience to leave a review, other than to say clear sailing, no red flags yet.i bought this machine from the returned/renew store on amazon for the discount.The quality was as new, the operation flawless. i am satisfied.",
