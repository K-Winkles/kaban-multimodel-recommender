Selecting cooking settings requires very few actions, unlike some ovens where you have to cycle through many presets to get what you want.Light illuminates interior very well, shutoff switch when door is opened (unlike some other ovens), and very convenient crumb tray on the bottom that can be slid out with the oven door closed.i contacted the manufacturer's customer service to get an additional rack: they were very responsive and helpful and sent it out quickly. A nice change from dealing with many manufacturers these days.i use this oven on a daily basis. Highly recommended.",

Pizza crust came out crisp with hot toppings and melted cheese and was delicious. It states that outside of unit can get hot during use and it gets extremely hot to touch. I could see that it might cause an issue to surrounding countertop or cabinets as directions say to have 4 inches clear around air fryer. Right now I am happy with purchase.",
