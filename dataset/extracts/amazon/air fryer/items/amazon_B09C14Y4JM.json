                "reviewText": "Bought this in July and we have used it for everything--from drying herbs, toast, bagels, making biscuits in a cast iron frying pan, making Thanksgiving side dishes which we usually cook in the oven, air frying fish and fries, melting cheese for sandwiches, proofing, and convection. It came in so handy over Thanksgiving as the turkey cooked in the oven--we cooked many of the side dishes here. It cooks evenly and is very easy to set or reset. It's bigger inside than it looks--I cannot believe what we were able to fit inside. I bought it b/c my husband doesn't like a lot of digital gadgets and this one is so easy to use--even he can figure it out. :) It's easy to clean--you pull out the plate and it cleans up quickly. It pre-heats very quickly. Once it's pre-heated, it switches to keeping time. The dials allow you to change the cooking time. Dials for toasting allow you to choose the toast setting and the number of slices. My husband remarked that the air fryer option is much better than our air fryer and I would agree. In fact, you do not have to interrupt the cooking to flip the food. It cooks both sides evenly. There is a light that stays on during cooking so it's easy to see inside. I did a lot of research on these ovens and for the price and performance, you cannot beat the Kitchen Aid. One last comment: I read somewhere to stay away from models with dials on top. These dials are on the bottom and the fan is in the back. The top can get pretty hot so leave enough room on each side for air to flow. Only negative is cleaning crumbs is a pain to get in the small areas. Also, the unit does not turn off when you open the door. I highly recommend this unit.",

                "reviewText": "We loved our old basket air fryer but increasingly felt the need to upgrade it to something that can also handle other tasks such as toasting. We find we use our air fryer/oven a lot but it's just not worth it to spend 30 minutes on our inefficient gas oven just to try and toast bread (let's not even get into how worthless our gas range oven's broil function is). We thought about getting a giant sized air fryer but dreaded the counter space footprint for something that you still can't toast at the same time as air frying chicken/veggies.That put is in the market of a toaster oven.. and hey, why not an oven that could functionally take over the role of our very bad range oven? At the same time, we air fry a LOT and didn't want to sacrifice our ability to air fry things well. Spent weeks researching and every model from Ninja to Breville seemed to have big downsides. Ninja's reliability, lack of support for standard 9x13 pans, and questionable even baking performance put me off their offerings - they seemed much more \"air fryer\" first, everything else second. Breville was expensive and didn't seem to do air frying well at all due to it's more traditional toaster oven style fan design. More \"toaster oven\" first, everything else second.This product does everything we wanted absolutely perfect. Thanks to the dual fans in the back, it actually air frys almost as good as our basket air fryer with no tossing/flipping required. As a bonus, unlike every other \"air fryer oven\" we looked at, the air fry mode is QUIET. Which made me think it wasn't working until the chicken + potatoes came out completely evenly cooked and crispy with only 2-3+ extra minutes of cook time vs our basket style fryer. It bakes perfect cakes, see the pictures. The probe mode is awesome and handled a pork roast flawlessly. Everything preheats and cooks fast. Oh yeah, and it toasts perfectly fine.Capacity is great. Fits our casserole dishes we already own just fine, and you can fit a big roast in it. One thing to keep in mind, it's less easy to fit multiple trays of items. You CAN do it by being clever with the fry basket it comes with to add a second tray of food in, or just cooking the 2nd row of stuff in the basket, but performance is hurt. Not a big deal if the stuff you are cooking isn't that delicate.A traditional basket fryer is still better in terms of ease of use, clean up and cook time. Nothing can substitute how easy it is to just drop a basket of stuff on a plate and call it a day. It takes longer to get food out of this oven's air fryer basket and takes longer to clean. But it's not significantly worse at anything of these aspects vs a basket air fryer, which was important to us.My only real criticism is it doesn't have all the nice quality of life features the breville has. No timer paused on door open, no magnetic tray, etc. It's a rather \"what you see is what you get\" appliance. But that works pretty good for us and we appreciate that it looks sharp, while averaging a lot cheaper than the Breville does.So if you're looking for an all in one device - this one does it. It toasts, it bakes, it roasts, and it actually air fry's without skipping a beat. So, so much more efficient than our regular oven at doing everything and with much less energy spent.",

I have cooked broiled salmon, baked meatloaves and air fry veggies because of choice to use 4 or 5 elements and fans it the right place the heating was excellent.

                "reviewText": "After purchasing this Kitchen Aid countertop oven a month or so ago, I have been impressed with its versatility and performance.Using the meat probe, cooked both a standing rib roast and a leg of lamb; both were done to my satisfaction. Rib roast was delicious; cooked medium rare, was flavourful without adding salt or pepper until after roasting was done and meat sat prior to carving.Leg of lamb also cooked rare; although a bit too rare, meat was delicious, flavourful as I used a Balsamic marinade for several hours prior to cooking.Both meats were cooked not with the enclosed pan but in two seperated roasting pans that are over 65 years old! And they fit with room to spare!Air frying has also produced very good results; French fries, Barber chicken all cooked with very good results. I also used parchment paper made specifically for air fryer countertop ovens such as this Kitchen Aid. I also purchased nonstick sheets to keep the crumb tray clean, it has worked out very well.For toasting I have toasted English muffins and they came out to my satisfaction as well.My only two issues are with frozen pizza like Screamin Sicilian bakes cold in the center, well cooked by the crust. And oven starts countdown immediately after preheating, which precluded a star.I also purchased a 12\" square pizza stone; oven door fully shuts but is too big for baking rack.Although early days, I'm extremely satisfied with this Kitchen Aid countertop oven; two fans, five elements, many cooking options.Added note; the fans were initially loud when first using oven right after unboxing but are now so silent one cannot hear them unless you open the oven door or are extremely close.",

It's extremely intuitive, and figuring out function/time/temp is simple. The heat is even, and it does a great job. Nice and spacious - yes, that means it takes up a bit more space than some options, but it gives plenty of space to cook/reheat a great meal without turning on the regular oven.10/10",

The non-stick interior truly saves me time and effort.The adjustable thermostat is another useful feature of this oven. It allows me to easily control the temperature and ensures that my dishes are cooked to perfection.

The versatility of this oven is truly impressive.In terms of accessories, the KitchenAid Digital Countertop Oven comes with a 9x13 inch baking pan with a grill rack, a removable metal drip and crumb tray, and a removable metal rack. These accessories are all high-quality and enhance the overall cooking experience.The power cord length of 3-1/5 is more than sufficient for my needs, and the warm-function feature is a great addition. It allows me to keep my dishes warm until I'm ready to serve them.",
