                "reviewText": "I read it was Teflon-free, so ceramic, which was a requirement for me in an air fryer. I was delighted to see it was so dang cute! And cheap. My only qualm as per other reviews too, is the timer is that super old-school, cheap microwave kind (think crappy microwaves at convenience stores) where you turn it to a time, say 10 mins, and you can\u2019t decide it\u2019s done or you want less time by turning it counter clockwise to say 5 mins. It won\u2019t go. And you can\u2019t turn it off with the timer dial to say 0. It won\u2019t go. It only turns clockwise to a higher amount of time. To me that\u2019s so annoying and inflexible. Giving us less control. What they do is force you to instead pull the tray out in order to stop it, which is awkward. Or unplug it, till the timer runs out on its own.Anyway, for how cute it is and the price, I can live with that, though I hope they fix it in any design updates.It\u2019s perfect for my main reason for buying it: making a single homemade chocolate chip cookies! Lol.Yes, it\u2019s my way to have it all. A tiny fresh-baked cookie in 10 mins time, anytime. I make chocolate chip cookie dough in advance, portion it into individual cookie sizes, and freeze for when I want just one. I used to do this in a toaster oven which air fryers have basically replaced. So, after a meal when I want a small treat, I pop one cookie dough ball into the fryer on a small, heat-safe dish like foil or a tart dish, set the temp pretty low since fryers are basically super-charged convection ovens, about 250\u00b0, at 10 mins (frozen dough takes longer..in a reg oven they\u2019d take 12-13 at 350\u00b0).And bing! I have a delicious cookie! Better than regular ovens since the convection aspect makes cookie edges have that buttery crispness, yet the inside is gooey. Heaven! (Convection means a fan is pushing and swirling hot air all around your food vs it just sitting in stagnant hot air.)Helps me watch my weight, easily making only one at a time. Doesn\u2019t heat up the kitchen (well, a little heat exhaust happens) and is more environmentally friendly.Works well for the same concept in cakes! Make cake batter. Freeze it in a square pan. Once frozen, pop it out of the pan onto a cutting board. Chop it with a large knife into 2\u201d square pieces. Throw into your freezer till you crave it. Then, like the cookies, take a frozen cake batter square out, set it into the fryer and bake! You have a single portion piece of cake! (Though cake batter works pretty well microwaved too since microwaves do moist. Cookie dough needs dry air to bake well so only ovens).",

                "reviewText": "This little thing cooks crazy fast! I cooked breaded fish that should take 10 minutes at 400F (package air fryer instructions) in less than 5 minutes without preheating. I originally set it at 13 minutes since the air fryer instructions recommends a 3 minute preheat. I\u2019m amazed how fast it cooks since I have a much larger one that takes ages to cook anything. The best part is it doesn\u2019t draw much power (700w) and can run this off my Ecoflow River 2 Pro power bank (see picture). Only downside is it\u2019s hard to tell how much time is left on the timer. Very easy to clean and can\u2019t wait to try it out camping!",

The color blue is also not navy as shown but more of a dark slate blue. I did reorder another which the timer did work properly and am keeping it, only because it is very small which I wanted and also because it is blue although not the navy I had hoped for. It also doesn\u2019t cook nearly as well as the larger Dash brand I have. Honestly I would have purchased a different brand if I could have gotten a dark blue one in the small size.
