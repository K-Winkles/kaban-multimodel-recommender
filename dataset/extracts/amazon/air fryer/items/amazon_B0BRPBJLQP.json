The result is great satisfaction. I'm satisfied with the color because it's not a normal color that you can see anywhere, but a luxurious color. The silicone glove that is provided as a bonus is also very efficient.It has completely changed the way I cook in my airfryer. The liner is made of high-quality silicone and is very durable. I love that I can cook without any added oil and my food still comes out crispy and delicious. Cleaning the liner is a breeze and it fits perfectly in my airfryer. I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves to cook healthy meals without the added mess.",
