                "reviewText": "Here are three things I love about it:1.) It\u2019s quick! There is no pre-heating with this machine and it cooks food so incredibly fast. The Parmesan asparagus I made only took 3 minutes to cook and tasted delicious. (That would have taken much longer if boiling, baking, or saute\u0301ing.)2.) It\u2019s safer than a microwave. Air fryers use convection waves as opposed to actual micro waves. Don\u2019t ask me the science on this one but I\u2019ve always heard microwaves are terrible for you and now I reheat my food with the air fryer. (Ex: I\u2019ve reheated leftover meats and they taste like they were just freshly cooked.)3.) It\u2019s a healthy alternative to deep-frying. Rather than submerging foods in oil to achieve the crispy and fried taste, you simply just spritz food with a little olive oil (depending on the food you\u2019re making.) The food is evenly cooked and tastes crisp!I will say this machine was a little bit of a learning curve for me (but honestly, what kitchen gadget isn't?) I tried three recipes from an air fryer magazine and I burnt every single one of them because I didn\u2019t realize just how fast the food cooks. I just cut down the recommended cook times significantly and that fixed my user error. My recommendation is just to watch your cook times until you get used to using it. The timer feature is super helpful because then it will auto-shutoff.I do wish there was a window to view the food but you can just simply pop open the fryer and push it back in with no problems. Sometimes those cook windows in machines get hard to clean anyway.Lastly, the 7 qt size isn't large enough to fill an entire bag of frozen fries but because this cooks so quickly, you can do two rounds in no time. This model seems like it would be good for a couple or maybe a family of 4.It's quite large on my countertop but is light enough that it can be moved back and forth between my pantry and countertop. It's super easy to clean and I love that its parts are dishwasher friendly.Overall, I highly recommend it!UPDATE 12/9/20Sadly, after only a few weeks of use it seems like the fan isn't spinning correctly. I plan to write customer service and will update when I hear back.",

                "reviewText": "I want to say, this arrived in good condition. Works great.However, I asked around a lot before I bought it. I was told this kind doesn't smoke. Lol!!It smokes. May not see the smoke but, it smokes as it alerts the smoke alarm about 3 feet away. I even turned the ceiling fans on beforehand. Moved the air fryer so the vent was in the opposite direction. The smoke alarm still goes off.Now, the cooking process is wonderful! Less time in cooking. Food stays relatively warm while cooking other things up for a meal. I have only cooked frozen foods in this as of yet. I use a temperature of 370. Plus, I have never had to go over 10 minutes. At 5 minutes, I usually pause and turn items over or shake.It says to preheat. I have done that. I am not sure if it makes a difference or not.I enjoy cooking in this and I am happy that I have it.",
