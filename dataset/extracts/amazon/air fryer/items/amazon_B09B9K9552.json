                "reviewText": "I love this air fryer! It is very aesthetically pleasing on the counter top and doesn't take up too much space. It is very intuitive as far as programing the temperature and timer. There are many pre-sets that take out the guess-work. I've used it for frozen/seasoned haddock and French fries. The French fries were absolutely delicious and did not even need oil or salt & pepper. The pre-set timer was just the right amount of time for the fries. The fish was also perfectly cooked. Using the pre-set the fish was not overdone or dried out. I really like the design - there are edges under the fryer that are formed for your fingers so when you place your hand on the sides to lift it your fingers fit into the grooves perfectly. The electrical cord is not exceptionally long so you will need to place it fairly close to an outlet. My next plan is to look for recipes to do some type of baking like cupcakes, etc. I also purchased an olive oil sprayer and the air fryer parchment paper which I hope will help with decreasing some of the clean up even though the basket is a breeze to clean. So far, so good - I will rate it 5 stars at this point.Update: 8/10/21 I still love this air fryer. I love that I don't have to wait for my oven to heat up to warm up pizza or even cook a slice of frozen pizza. Such a time saver! There have been some questions as to how to take out the rack that sits in the base. There are rubber stoppers on the four corners that do a great job of holding the rack in place - until you want to remove it. I pry it up by one corner and then work on the other corners. This gets easier with use as I think they loosen a bit or I get better at removing the rack. Be patient, it works well and keeps the rack from moving around when you don't want it to.",

But then i read on line to wipe the entire thing inside and out in all plastic with vinegar this took 80% if the smell out. Also tried cooking a cup of vinegar inside the machine which also helped. Overall the 90% has burned off and i am sure with continued use it will fully subside Will update in a month",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this air-fryer because we love crispy chicken wings, drumettes and French fries. We were so pleased with how well they came out. Once you do the prep for the flavor you want and follow the instructions, this compact version of some of larger models out there holds its own in delivering your cravings for hot, crispy and delicious snacks or meals! (I made pork chops last night--yummy!) We've come to expect 'smart' features so this unit is easy to use and the clean up is just a matter of prepping it for the dishwasher. I hate seeing appliance cords so once I'm done 'kooc-ing', I can place the cord back into its cord holder in the back. This would make a great gift any time of the year! I'm very impressed and would recommend this to anyone interested in air-frying. I plan to use it this summer for outside dining, too! Who wants to turn on a stove in the summer? Not this air-fryer!! :D4.28.22. This is an update with two photos. I just finished making panko coated chicken thighs and they are as crispy as they look and taste crispy outside and moist inside! I'm so glad I gave air frying a chance; so much quicker and healthier than deep frying and I'm from the south. Kooc air fryer, you rock! <3 \ud83d\ude00 \ud83d\ude0d",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this air fryer!I was gifted power XL air fryer before this one, but I found it difficult to keep it clean. I also accidentally left the drawer to that one on the stove and melted the outside\u2026 So I started looking for a replacement and landed on Kooc.I love the barely off white color. It\u2019s a very subtle cream, or soft white. I was concerned that it might clash with my white cabinets, but I\u2019m realizing my white cabinets might also be cream, haha, so it\u2019s perfect!I absolutely love the way it cooks, and it is very easy to clean. I am considering getting liners for it, but up until now I have been using it without those, and I\u2019ve only had to spray the interior with hot tap water after use to clean it.FYI, before first use, I ran it without anything in it on 400\u00b0 for 15 minutes and a second time for 10 minutes. (Not sure if the second time was necessary) It burned off the plasticky burning smell and now I don\u2019t smell that anymore, just delicious food cooking.My only complaint is that the cord is too short for my liking. (Otherwise I\u2019d do 5 stars) It measures 2ft.My counter space is limited and the short cord limits me even more in where I can place it. I could get an extension cord, but I would rather just plug it into the wall.",
