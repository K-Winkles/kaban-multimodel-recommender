                "reviewText": "I don't know why we had been putting off getting an air fryer - probably one of the reasons was that there are so many out there that it is hard to choose. In the end I was happy I got this one. The size is perfect for a severing for two, and it cooks food so unexpectedly fast, that doing two rounds is not a pain. One of the things I like best, is how little time it takes to get pre-heated. The instructions on the screen help you along and makes it easy for a first time user to understand the process (not that using an air fryer is rocket science). But experimenting with times and temps for various foods is not that hard, so that you get just the right results.The size and aesthetics are spot on. It really matches our other GE stainless steel appliances and looks like is part of the Kitchen. Cleaning the trays is a breeze compared to a traditional oven. Can't commend about long term longevity but item looks sturdy enough. We have already gotten our money's worth out of it. Very happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Generally: Lower temperature by 25\u00b0F and set cooking time to 80% of the middle of the recommended cooking time for conventional oven instructions when cooking using air fryer mode. This usually gets you in the ballpark, but with a minute or two to go, you might have to stop it or add time. I've been using that method from the beginning, and it has served me well.The two trays are perfect for cooking for one to four people. Beyond that, you would probably be better off buying a larger single basket air fryer or even two of you need dual options.As you'd expect from Instant, the machine just works. I've only tried Air Fry, Bake, and Reheat modes. Looking forward to trying Roast, Broil, and Dehydrate. The synchronous cooking modes work generally speaking, but it seems a little kludgy. Even if you set the baskets to finish at the same time, they often don't. I'm only talking about a matter of seconds to maybe a minute apart, but it's annoying. It seems this is mostly caused by the preheating cycle taking different times, or if I leave one tray open longer than the other. I guess that's more of a user error though.I have made the usual fries and chicken nuggets (beautifully cooked). I also baked a loaf of bread (frozen preprepared dough, thawed overnight, then baked) that came out delightfully brown and crackly on top but slightly undercooked in the middle (my first attempt, so it's probably me).I love thawing frozen breakfast sandwiches and burritos in the microwave for a half their recommended cooking time, then throwing them in the cold air fryer, setting it for 3-5 minutes at 350-375\u00b0F, and letting them brown and crisp up. You can easily fit up to 4 using both baskets. They are so much better than in the microwave or toaster oven and so much quicker than baking.I made a meatloaf from scratch, and it was the best I've ever made. It was one of the first things I made in it. I was worried about the food burning or getting stuck on. I did use a little cooking spray, and everything washed up with ease. The bacon and sauce had an amazing crispiness to it that I could never duplicate in an oven.I've made a few frozen pizzas in it, to. First, while the air fryer is preheating, I score the frozen pizza in half with a pizza cutter, then I cut through the pizza and the cardboard with kitchen shears. When the oven is ready, using the cardboard, I slide one half into each tray. Freschetta Naturally Rising Crust is my favorite, but you have to fold the end of the pizza to get it to fit, and then it rises, making it tricky to get out. Other smaller pizzas for better and are easier to get out.The trays and inserts are easy to hand-wash, and the trays HAVE to be hand-washed, but the air fryer inserts are dishwasher safe, and I've done that twice after cooking really messy dishes.It does take up a large chunk of counter space, but since I use it pretty much every day, I don't mind. The back of the unit did put out quite a bit of hot air, so I don't keep anything heart sensitive nearby. It fits nicely under my cupboards. I usually keep a pair of tongs on top so I can quickly adjust food or grab things out when they are done.I have it 5/5 stars in everything except for \"easy to use\". That one missing star is because it has so many options it can be confusing to learn, and the synchronous cooking either doesn't work quite right or is so confusing I can't get it right. Also, the beep tones are really quiet, and it's easy to miss the prompts to insert the food or turn it. If you're not in the kitchen, you'd better set your own timers to keep track. This is one case where a \"smart\" controller on my phone would be super handy to tell me when the oven is preheated, to add food (wait, I'm coming!), when to turn it (or tell it the food didn't need turning), and when it's done. That will probably come out in version 2.0 and add $50 to the price. \ud83d\ude01It did have a funny smell at first, but it's gone away after a month of regular use. Cleanup is easy. Size is good for me for most things. I probably wouldn't try cooking a whole chicken in it, but 2 game hens would be perfect!Overall, I really like this unit and recommend it for individuals, couples, and small families that like to cook multiple things at once. Do look for a good sale. I got it on Prime Day, and I'm happy. I might be less so if I'd paid full retail price due to the small size when I cook for friends or extended family.",

I have two larger popular brand appliances \u2014a combo pressure cooker/air fryer/bake/roast and another air fryer/grill. They are big, bulky and take up a lot of counter space. And they are hard to clean.My daughter has a larger AirPot air fryer my 11 year old granddaughter uses with ease so I decided to try a smaller version for myself. I absolutely love it. Easy to use. Heats up quickly. Actually throws off less hot air and is a breeze to clean. Air fries, bakes, roasts. Big enough for one person. And, like I said, cleans up quickly and easily. I love it!

The Insta pot was more expensive than the other brands but in the end, I thought it was worth it for the added features that worked for me. I like the addition of the knob I like the fact that the basket could be put in the dishwasher or when hand washed could be completely submerged. It has a quick preheat and the display & time- temp is very easy to use with the knob. It seems to be very well-made & and is touted as BPA free. I would say that my model, the basket is more narrow, I would say this model is more slimline. I would say, it cooks enough for two people at a time. I\u2019m happy with the quality & the functionality even though it was a bit more money.",

The basket is big enough for two chicken patties and some fries. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s big enough for a family unless you\u2019re cooking the meat first and then cooking the potatoes afterward. Maybe another level with another cooking tray would solve that problem.",

I have cooked chicken, steak, pork, and salmon. I have also used the air fryer for shrimp and cod. It is compact, doesn't take up much room, is easy to clean and just all around versatile. I don't cook large quantities at a time, so it's much more energy efficient to have a small space to heat up vs. an oven. I am very happy.",

But we finally figured we'd get one to try and see what all the fuss was about. This one got good reviews and it was a lower price (for the capacity) than many others, plus I liked the design and the window to see the food.Wow. This thing is AWESOME!!!It looks like you'd imagine an air-fryer would look if Apple made one (and you know it would be called the 'iFry'). Very modern, very slick, super easy to use interface.I haven't used one without the window but find it really useful to see the food while it's cooking without having to open it so I'm glad we got this model, plus it's a very trusted brand. From reviews I'd seen you can't just go off the \"quart\" capacity - it's all about surface area with air-fryers so you want plenty of space so the food isn't crowded, which is what makes this one so good (vs others that may be the same or higher capacity, but by having more depth which isn't as good).So far we'd made Chicken Wings, both plain and breaded, and the breaded ones tasted as good or better than the best Fast Food Chicken you've ever had (KFC, Popeyes etc...). We've also made Burssel's Sprouts with Bacon and mmmmn, so delicious.Lots of more things to try making, but so far everything has worked out beautifully and cleanup has been a breeze. So definitely recommended.",
