                "reviewText": "Nothing is harder to do than cleaning the \"Old Style\" air fryer. One thing i absolutely hated to, so i rarely used it.So when i was in the market for a new one, i made sure to read ALL of the reviews for features i wanted. One of them was ease of cleaning.This one has removable grates for each removable basket. All you do is take it out, wash it off and wipe out the bottom of the basket and done! it doesn't get any easier than that. The non stick coating is so nice, nothing really sticks at all.I am also a fan of the duel temperature zones. You can cook 2 things on different temps if needed. IT works super fast. What normally took 15 minutes in my old one, only took 6 in this one. You can also Roast, Bake or Dehydrate in this guy. Not your average air fryer.I normally do tons of research before i buy an appliance. I didn't want to buy this just for the Ninja Foodi name. It just ended up being the one that fit my needs , price was right only $119.00 and i picked it for the basket size as well. they have ones that come with larger or smaller baskets.It comes with a quick start guide, it is not super complicated to use the first time. You do not have to sit and read it in its entirety in order to know what to do. It comes with multiple pages of cooking charts so you have an easy reference to do whatever task right at your finger tips.I promise, you will not be disappointed with any of the Ninja Foodi Air Fryers, whichever you choose.",

But it turns out to be the most user friendly appliance in the house. After just a few times I was confident nothing would blow up or burn. :) The machine, baskets and grates are top notch and so very easy to clean. The controls and functions made sense right away. Food comes out amazingly flavorful. Roasted veggies and potatoes are superb. Salmon is beyond superb. One of the surprises is not having anywhere near the left-over cooking odors in the house that you get from pan frying, searing or oven baking. This is a quality product I'd definitely recommend.",
