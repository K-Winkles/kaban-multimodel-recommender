Quick, crisp, flavorful, super easy to clean. Multifunction, not just air fryer mode. Easy to program, works better than advertised. I was a total skeptic about Ninja appliances but have a blender pro thing with smoothie cups, blender container and food processor container with a blade and dough blade, use it at least once per day for family of three. That's amazing, and this air fryer is amazing too. Made homemade 2 ingredient dough pizza pockets that were so much fun and quick. Homemade potato chips. Baked homemade ravioli. Crisped Brussel sprouts with onion and balsamic. The chicken!... Are you kidding me?! I'm not paid by anyone, I purchased with my own money and I just wanted to encourage others to go for it with the 10qt. It fits just fine on our 4' countertops with cabinets above. It takes up a little space but not that bad, especially since it's used so much. Prefer it to my electric double oven for most things. The shiny chrome-like coating on the basket handles came off after two washes in the dishwasher with the strongest cascade pods, just faded away and now the silver is white plastic...oh well, don't care, it looks fine and the rest of the units features and performance makes that insignificant at best. The 10 qt makes it possible to cook enough for a family of 2-6 in one batch. Just get it.",

You can use it so that it completes the food together or completes the food at separate times. It is super Easy to use and easy to clean. We throw it in the dishwasher every time and never had an issue. I use it nearly every other day. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Love all the features and cooking options. So glad I got the larger size, I feel it offers more consistency with allowing the food space to get that nice air circulation for the best air fry! Nothing gets crammed in etc. Having 2 independent cooking sides is also nice, I find I use side 2 for desserts or sweet items and side 1 for everything else. Been using it regularly for over half year with zero issues so far. I definitely feel like I can still have that crisp with food without frying in oil or adding tons of stuff in saut\u00e9 pan! Highly recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this as an upgrade from our single basket Cosori air fryer. The biggest draw on this model was the dual baskets, which allow for cooking two different things at two different temperatures. We\u2019ve cooked chicken strips and both cooked perfectly and I\u2019m very little time. The biggest drawback however, is that despite the size and bulk of this dual cooker unit, the individual baskets are extremely small. Whereas our old single basket air fryer could easily fit for chicken breasts, only two will fit in one of these baskets, and definitely only one if the chicken breast is oversized. One of the biggest cons about this air fryer that differs from one of our favorite features of our old air fryer is also that there are not any real categories. Our single unit air fryer by Cosori features, photos of bacon, pizza, frozen foods, and other common items that made it very easy to cook something without dragging out an owners manual, or even looking at the directions on a bag of frozen french fries. The single unit cooks things very well and required very little thought in the process. this unit has no such functionality. Even after reviewing all three manuals that came with this unit, it was impossible to find any straightforward directions on cooking, frozen french fries, for instance. What might be written on the outside of the frozen french fry bag, is not always the standard for every unit. What works for my old air fryer would not work for the new one. we experimented and ultimately just decided to go with what we thought was best since there were no air fryer instructions on the particular bag we were using, and luckily everything worked out well. The frozen chicken strips did have air fryer, instructions, and although we did not cook them as long as the bag indicated, I was able to check them frequently, and this air fryer did a sufficient job. If I had to purchase this over again, I probably would not. For the bulk, and this unit is extremely large, and will take up a great deal of counterspace, so that\u2019s something you should know going in, I expected larger baskets and more functionality. I have not tried the dehydrating feature, which is something our old unit didn\u2019t have, but we were interested in, so once I do that I will update this review. Since we\u2019ve only used this unit a couple of times, it is only been washed a couple of times. Both times I threw the baskets in the dishwasher, removing the pans that detached from within them, and tossing all of them into the dishwasher. Everything came out clean, but it\u2019s difficult to say what the dishwasher will do to the nonstick finish over time.",

With a family, the two baskets are great for different foods- and the cooking time match is spot on! We have made lots of meals and it used at least 4-5 times a week and so far has held up great and food has been cooked well. Easy to clean.
