                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars ALMOST perfect so far!",
                "reviewText": "So we purchased this stainless steel dehydrator rack not so much for dehydrating things but to use inside our very first Ultrean brand 7 quart air fryer. We were anticipating, and it proved to be correct, that certain foods such as turkey drumsticks or turkey thighs or certain other things might actually benefit from being separated and raised up so that heat could circulate underneath it and make cooking time even shorter. By using the stainless steel rack, we were able to cook large turkey thighs in only 20 minutes at the setting of 375\u00b0 in our air fryer.So far the cleanup has been generally pretty simple because we haven\u2019t really cooked too many \u201cmessy\u201d things. The only thing that kind of got stuck was the skin of the turkey legs a little bit but that was as much to blame on the fact that we didn\u2019t want to wipe down the stainless steel with a light coating of cooking spray before hand and that probably could\u2019ve prevented the sticking. We\u2019ve cooked some things with this rack in the air fryer (breaded cod fillets) where we only had to do a light rinse under running water and we\u2019ve also cook the turkey legs to the point where we ran it through the dishwasher and it came out fine.Generally speaking, when fully assembled this dehydrator rack holds together rather well for putting into our air fryer as well as coming out because it has the built-in side handles. One of the few things that I have a problem with is that to keep it a bit more compact there is very little spacing between each of the racks making it next to impossible to try to flip anything without fully removing the racks first. Our early experiences with this find that in order to offload the racks you really have to do it in reverse order of loading which means when you\u2019re unloading you take the top one off and then then you can get out the second from the top and the third from the top without too much trouble and risk of dumping your items onto the floor.Obviously, if you are using this for dehydrating purposes only you may not have any need in your directions to actually flip individual items but again the clearance space between one shelf and the next is probably less than an inch so keep that in mind which is the case with many of these types of dehydrator shelving units.",

                "reviewText": "First I dehydrated one apple, slicing it into 1/8\" slices. That - along with a few blueberries scattered between the slices - filled the 5 racks - with adequate space between slices. I dehydrated at 165 F for 12 hours, I think. After cooling, the slices were a pleasant texture - slightly crispy, neither pliable nor hard. They tasted great! It only took me one evening of feeling \"snacky\" to eat the entire apple. I'm kind of wondering how much electricity goes into one apple. (The blueberries were good, too. They were different sizes and different textures to begin with, but they were tasty.)Then I tried using the 5 racks for breaded zucchini \"chips\". That did a pretty fair job - at least as well as the bottom rack of the double \"steaming\" basket. That's the main \"versatile\" use. It does increase the \"real estate\" available to air fry.The racks are kind of small. Since they allow almost total air flow, it would be nicer if they took up almost all of the IP inner pan, but there's a lot of unused dead space. I'd like to see that change.I am really, really glad they are made of stainless steel, not crudzo non-stick stuff. And it appears to be a decent stainless, not one of the super-cheap alloys like 1808 steel.Will I personally use it enough to justify $31+? That is a question. And that would be a question for any buyer. But if you're going to try or buy an IP Duo air fryer combo (or an IP with another AF lid), this is a useful accessory.",

                "reviewText": "This rack has been a game changer for me. It fits perfectly inside my 6-quart Instant Pot and I love that you can customize the tiers to fit the food you want to stack. Taking out every other tier is perfect for doing three layers of wings and drumsticks. It\u2019ll feel a little flimsy because the rack shifts slightly when you push it, but the whole unit fits together like a puzzle so it\u2019s stable and I haven\u2019t had any issues with it coming apart. Cleanup is also super easy. I\u2019ve forgotten to oil my wings and pieces of chicken skin ended up getting stuck to the rack. But no problem! I just put the rack back in the pot and filled it with water until it was submerged; once the skin softened, it brushed right off! If you want to step up your instant pot game and increase your versatility (and quantity!) in your pressure cooking, buy this!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this with doubts. When I unpacked it and tried to put it together I was concerned about stability. But since I have now used it about 5 times with my new instant pot air fryer lid I am more than convinced. It is perfect. Perfect! I can layer fries, falafel, etc. on the closely spaced shelves. They are thoughtfully spaced, but you also have the option to use fewer shelves if you have taller items. And it does not fall apart when I pick it up fully loaded to put it in the stainless steel liner. It also cools quickly which makes it easier to remove foods after cooking. NO MORE flipping fries one-by-one in the oven!!!! Space for generous portions for two people. If you have a larger family it may be a problem. But I believe all air fryers have space limitations. Not the fault of these fabulous little shelves!",

I was looking for something to use for my fryer's dehydrate function.",

I recently dried 1/4 thick venison jerky in 4 hours instead of 6 with an old dehydrator. 2 hours at 165 and then reverse the order of the trays and go another 2 hours. Everyone loves the final product. It is a little small, 5lbs too 4 loads. Clean up was a wiz, dishwasher made them look like new. Make suer to use cooking spray to prevend sticking.",

I use this rack in my Instant Pot Due Nova, 6 quart. Easy to use, easy to clean (I was concerned that would be a problem), and easy to store away!I made beef jerky for my first use and again...so easy! You have to rotate the racks throughout the process to ensure even dehydration, but that wasn't tough either. The racks slide in and without a problem...so that was a relief!Short story long...I very comfortably recommend this product! :)",

They are easy to wash after use.The downside is that the rack sits quite deep within the pot, making it difficult to grip and lift out safely by the handles, even with the IP mini silicon mitts.As the top layers cook faster than the bottom, the trays do need to be rotated, it can be quite challenging to remove and replace them while hot.Overall, it is a useful accessory, but there are some challenges.",
