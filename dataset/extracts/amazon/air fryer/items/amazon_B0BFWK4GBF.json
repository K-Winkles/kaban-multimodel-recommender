I don't have one of those but I do have a different one that is close to the same size and that this fits just fine.Two issues of concern:1. The first cutting board I received was badly warped. I contacted seller and they promptly sent a replacement which was perfectly flat. So five stars for customer service! That said, this cutting board is relatively thin compared to a traditional oak or maple cutting board so I am concerned about longevity. Which brings me to point 2.2. Bamboo cutting boards need to be oiled, especially ones that are exposed to high heat that will dry out the wood. I learned this with a small bamboo cutting board I used under a tabletop grill: it warped badly. I replaced it and oiled the new one sort-of regularly and have had no problems with it.So to keep this cutting board flat, I recommend oiling it with good quality cutting board oil.",
