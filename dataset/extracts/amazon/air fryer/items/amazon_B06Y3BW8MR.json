                "reviewText": "I purchased the Power Air Fryer XL kind of on a whim. I watched the infomercial and I was hooked. When it came, it was a bit intimidating, but after reading the instructions, the recipe book, and watching some youtube videos I felt I had a handle on it.It's very easy to use once you get a handle on the menu button. There are preset time/temp for certain foods or you can manually set the time and temp. I've fixed mostly chicken (legs, thighs, breasts, wings) and the key is turning the chicken. The first time I air fried the chicken, I didn't turn it, and the coating was odd. The next time, I turned it about every 10 minutes or so and it was perfect. It saves on oil and time cleaning up the mess. We made chicken wings and they were better than a deep fryer and/or oven. They were awesome.Here are the things we noticed that you might want to be aware of 1) when air frying something with a lot of fat (thighs, ect) the unit will smoke. You just have to pull out the basket, drain the grease and put it back in. It's a pain, but the results are awesome. We made a batch of thighs and had to drain the grease twice, we made a batch of legs and didn't have to drain it at all. 2) you will need to season your meat more. Since you are getting the flavor from the oil, the \"taste\" of whatever your air frying might be a little bland. We just use more seasonings and that works for us.Other than those two little issues, we love it. It's a breeze to clean and seems much faster than baking or even pan frying.",

Has some chips in the plastic shell and it's hard to slide back in sometimes like it doesn't quite fit together right or was damaged in some way. If you can get the basket in it heats up really hot and fast though and it has great capacity so I'm going to keep it.",
