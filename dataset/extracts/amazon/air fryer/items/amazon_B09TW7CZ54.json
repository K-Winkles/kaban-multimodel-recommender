                "reviewText": "I am using them in a Cuisinart TOA-95 AirFryer Toaster Oven.I have used them for toast and for air frying fish fillets, hashbrown patties, hot dogs, tater tots, boiled eggs, french fries and a few other things, I have used them on the rack, in the pan, and in the pan with the basket on top for air frying. A lot of the cooking was done at 400, and 450 degrees, without any problems. They did not smell, or smoke. They clean up great. When rinsing, the water flows off instantly, with very little drying needed.I tried one on the crumb tray, but when using preheat it was only 1 inch below the heating element which was too close and did not seem safe as it was not looking right. Better safe than sorry, but I did not need one on it anyway because the liners kept crumbs and such from falling on it.I have a couple of different types of real good tongs, so I sure was not expecting to like the ones that come with these liners, but boy was I wrong. These tongs being much smaller, are working out great for using with my air fryer toaster oven! They are good enough for my needs and I am glad to have them.I really need a 12\u00d714 inch or more liner for cutting to the size that I want, but I ordered these anyway, and have been very surprised at how good they are. I like them a lot. I have found nothing wrong with these liners and will keep using them, but I will also be getting some larger ones to cut to the sizes that I want.These are too good to not keep them. I cook a few things that these will be good to use for.I thought that the liners sounded too good to be true, but I would give them a try, and it was true.You should be happy with these if a 12\u00d712 liner is the size that will work for you.",

I bought some parchment paper liners for the basket, but was going through them so fast, so I was happy to see these reusable mats. I trimmed a couple to fit the basket and punched holes in one. I have been using them for several days and they work wonderfully! Food cooks great, there is zero odor from the mat, and clean-up is quick and easy. I used one to line a small baking sheet that I use in the oven, so now it is a breeze to clean up, also. I am so happy with this product!",
