It\u2019s massive, definitely not for people with a small kitchen! I\u2019m in love though. I used my old air fryer almost every day for 7 years and I can already tell I\u2019m going to use this one way more. It has so many functions it\u2019s crazy. I cooked up some corn dogs for the kids and in 12 minutes flat from frozen we had hot crispy dogs, no flipping, my oven doesn\u2019t even heat up that fast and my old air fryer would have taken a few extra minutes and needed to be flipped. Tonight we\u2019re going to cook a frozen pizza since this thing is massive enough to fit one.So far I'm extremely happy with this purchase! Feels well made and works very well!",

Not a small counter-top appliance but not too big as to be unwieldy either. For all the operations you get in one unit this is a very good buy. Took off one star as controls could be better and the back of the unit gets very hot (some additional shielding would help here).Note that there are several models on the Amazon site that look similar with similar functions. That is because these are all made in China in the same factory and just get different brand names slapped on them. So buy the one at the current cheapest discounted price and you'll save some money.And a question, why were there so many Vine free product reviews for this? Seemed like an abnormal number of these reviews, just kind of odd.",

Took a little time learning the functions (of course more than a regular air fryer). Booklet explains clearly and all functions work great. I kept an eye on initially cooking things, some cook a smidge sooner, but not at all bad. Just need to get familiar. Totally recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this 32 QT Digital Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, Kitchen in the box Convection Oven as we live in a tiny home with no stove/oven and I needed something to fit our space but big enough that it could feed 6 people.Upon receiving it I was very pleased with the size. I had a 6lb chicken I planned cooking with the rotisserie option, however it was slightly too big. If I had had some butcher twine I could have tied the legs and wing up tight and likely been able to use it, but I had run out. I decided to try the roasting pan and roast the chicken instead. Let me tell you it turned out AMAZING. My family went on and on about how good it was! I am looking forward to trying the rotisserie too once I get more twine.I haven't yet used it for anything else but I can't wait to do so! I also like that it has a dual cook option. What this means is that when I make a casserole, I can set it up to bake it and broil it to brown the top all in one go! I have to say, I am super pleased with it so far.The functions take some getting used to as it's only partially touch screen, but I know the more I use it the easier it will get.",
