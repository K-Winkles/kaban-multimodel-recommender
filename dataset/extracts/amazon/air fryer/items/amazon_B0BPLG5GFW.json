There seem to be more positive than negative reviews and perhaps this was glitch in quality control and language barrier.I still like the design and will consider purchasing again.Don't give up if you have an issue with performance. They appear to be genuinely concerned.Previous Reviews:This Company has no Customer Service response, and AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE says they are unable to contact the company also...(!!!?!!!) and they will not call the company to initiate an inquiry.I've tried FOUR TIMES to contact them (by emails, their website and phone calls) to obtain either repair or replacement per the 1 year warranty. and they do not respond. I called their phone number in China at 10:30 am (their time) on a Wednesday and there is no answer and no message.I bought it as I liked it's size, perfect for a small kitchen; the viewing window is a nice feature and it is very easy to clean.It worked great for about 3 months. Thereafter it would occasionally not turn on. Then it stopped turning on all together. It has a one year warranty, so I will contact the manufacturer about repair or replacement and write a new review after that experience.",
