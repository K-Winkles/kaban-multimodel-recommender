I really like the color This is a small air fryer, takes up a small counter area. It is not loud when running. The little buttons on the front of the air fryer are easy to see and use. We use the air fryer to air fry, bake and reheat foods. It is so easy to use, and to clean which is one reason we love it so much.This is not our first Air Fryer. It is the smallest, easiest to use and clean. Takes up very little counter space, works as it should. Does a great job cooking in a nice little pan which has a good sized contoured handle on it that is easy to hold and use to pull the pan from the machine and to put it back into the pan. We wish we had found this little jewel sooner. Yes, buy one for yourself, it is good quality product and reasonable price. And very pretty on kitchen counter",

                "reviewText": "This is my first air fryer. I live alone and have a small kitchen, wanted something I could put away in a cabinet when not in use, and this fits the bill.The fan noise is not a big deal (and when it's cold I love holding my hands next to the exhaust vent for the warm air), it had a plasticky smell the first 2-3 times I used it (I did wash the basket before use), but now it smells fine. Cleaning is a breeze - I spray the basket with water vigorously right after cooking and that's usually enough. Some things, like roasting drippy tomatillos, burned the juice to the bottom. A quick soak and then a wipe with a sponge and it was clean again.So far everything I've cooked I've just done at 400 (the air fry temperature), but it's easy to change the temperature and the time. I like the \"food turn\" beeps around 2/3 of the way through the time as well as when it's preheated and when it's done.The basket is too short to roast a whole red bell pepper (even after removing the tray from the basket), but cutting the pepper in half and putting foil under it worked great. I've also roasted thinner chiles whole (hatch, anaheim, jalapeno, pasilla), and it doesn't set off my fire alarm the way my broiler does, while still cooking the whole chiles enough that the skin blackened and came right off.Other successes: roasting nuts, baking pie crust cookies, falafel, broccoli (had to learn to put the stems in way early and only put the florets in at the end because they'll burn), roasting garlic or onions or tomatillos, crisping up tofu, sweet potato fries, butternut squash.So far I haven't used any recipes for time and temperature - I've done everything at 400 and put it on for 20 minutes and just keep checking it for doneness until I figure out what works. I think I'm going to try caramelizing bananas next.This thing is fun! I can't make enough sweet potato fries as I want in a single batch, but I can make as many as I should probably eat in one sitting. It's plenty big enough to make as much broccoli as I want, go figure.",
