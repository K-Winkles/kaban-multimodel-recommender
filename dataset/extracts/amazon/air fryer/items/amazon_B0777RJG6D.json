                "reviewText": "I got this over 15 months ago. I think this is a great fryer. I have cooked a cake, meatballs, lasagna, bread, onion rings, fries, wings, nuggets, egg rolls, fish, shrimp, scallops, crab cakes, chicken, and 100 other things in it, but, admittedly, I use it three times as much to warm leftovers. I mean anything you have leftover that was fried comes out as good as when you ordered it the restaurant. Seriously - as long as you don't over cook it, it is perfect.At first, I was haunted by the reviews that showed the coating coming off the basket after the first time, or some of the other negative reviews. So glad I did let those few overcome me! 15 months later - my basket looks like new. I don't even wash it but maybe once a week (and by wash I mean squirt dawn into a damp soft sponge and wipe it down - that's all it takes, because nothing sticks. Rinse and dry.) I can only imagine what those people did to scrape the coating off - and I bet they will never admit it either.Plug it in, push the second button from the left (15 mins @ 370 default). Up down temp on the left - Up down time on the right. Push the second button from the left and cook. It is amazingly simple and so fast. Don't like the default - it has like 8 preset choices.What do you expect from a fryer? Simple, Easy, Non-stick, and produces great leftovers plus fresh fried and baked food. All checked! This thing is amazing.The only minor negative I have is the temp only changes in 10 degree increments - like there is no 325 degrees possible. So minor - use 320 and be done with it. Easy-Peasy. Comes out perfect anyway.21 month update: finally a couple of issues.1) On the bottom pan is a rubber support to keep the proper distance between the bottom and top pans. This support has rubbed a small section of the coating off.2) The plastic \u2018nut cover\u2019 fell of and I tossed it out.Neither has any impact to the operation whatsoever.Included pics of the 2 issues plus a pic of the top of both pans. This is after near daily use over 21 months. Still an amazing buy and value to me.30 month update: Multiple daily uses with great results. Fried some chicken wings for lunch today (not leftovers either). Delish!! Absolutely no change from the 21 month update. Wash once a week - I squirt Dawn on the soft side of a sponge (not the scrubby side) - dry with a paper towel. Never dreamed this would last 2 1/2 years.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace an older GoWise air fryer that I wore out over 5 years of almost daily use. The new model has a different shape, more oblong than round, that I like better. It fits closer to the side wall in the corner of my counter under a cabinet and I like the more rectangular shape of the basket. The controls are easier to use and you can stop it while cooking and change time and/or temperature settings, which you could not do on the older model. It has 8 preset cooking times and temperatures, but I know how I want to cook most things anyway. It is well worth the money, especially if I get another 5 years out of this one.",

                "reviewText": "This was actually a replacement purchase. A while back (during the days of Amazon Treasure Truck) I got one of these at a fairly steep discount. I have to say that I loved it, it worked like a better microwave. I could heat up or reheat food to better flavor and consistency, temperature controls were great and I discovered a lot of versatile ways to use it including being able to fry eggs, make grilled cheese, even make breaded porkchops.So you may wonder why my review isn't better. Well the answer is that the first one basically fell apart. Now it went through a move and I can accept that maybe it got damaged during the move or something similar. But we had a couple screws fall out during what I could classify as normal use. In addition after one fall to the floor the baskets container would not fully reconnect with the device. It also started randomly shutting off during use.Now all of this could be chalked up to wear and tear and operator error, and if I'm honest the other options at the price point either didn't have enough volume or didn't offer enough temperature control for the versatility I wanted. But I also noted that some of the problems I mentioned were being echoed in the comments. I was concerned but given the alternatives I decided it would be best to stick with what I knew. Now, overall it does work well and I haven't had it try to shut itself off, however I have had a few instances where the basket and basket container will not seem to want to fit back in. In this case I know I haven't dropped anything and neither have my roommates. While it still functions it does have me concerned that the product may have a more limited lifespan or some kind of common internal issue.I was considering 3 stars but for now the issues have been fairly minor and the other advantages still win out. I will also add that anyone looking to buy it look at getting the liner paper as it is a lifesaver as well as strongly recommend looking at some of the accessories to allow for cooking eggs. All other things considered in a studio apartment I would probably be fairly well set up with this and a decently good slow cooker",

They are too light to keep paper down, it flew up and burned!!! Easy to set time and temperature. Only issue is with the tray. Takes a while to get it to slide in perfectly. I usually use 2 hands and push it in on each side of the tray. Sits on my counter and looks awesome. We are only 2 people but would not have gone smaller sized as it nice to have room around the items. Definitely would recommend it. And buy from Amazon as it was a seamless delivery, as usual!! \ud83d\ude0a",

El \u00fanico detalle que considero pudiese mejorarse es el poder variar las lecturas de la temperatura, ya que se expresan en grados Fahrenheit, pero es sencillo realizar la conversi\u00f3n de ser necesario. Incluye un recetario muy bien editado y sumamente practico, adem\u00e1s de la posibilidad de descargar su aplicaci\u00f3n gratuita en donde tambi\u00e9n se pueden consultar las recetas. Un producto elegante y funcional que te permitir\u00e1 cocinar con menor cantidad de grasas. En algunos alimentos el cambio de sabor es muy marcado, pero considero que bien vale la pena el acostumbrarse. Muy recomendable.",
