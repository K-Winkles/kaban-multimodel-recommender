I bought this as a Christmas gift for my fianc\u00e9 because we only had two since air fryers and she loves it as well as I do.It would be nicer to have the baskets wider vs being as deep as they are, but it was still big enough to get our 4 chicken breast pieces in one basket to do our green beans in the other.You can do the cook temps/times separately or together and it reminds you to shake/flip halfway through.I will say though - when you buy it, wash the baskets, then run the air fryer empty at 400 degrees for 40 minutes, pull baskets out and let them cool, then insert them again and repeat the cycle 6-10 times to burn off the new appliance smell. After that you should be good to go.",
