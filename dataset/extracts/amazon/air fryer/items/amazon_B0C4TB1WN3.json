                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My oldest air fryer gave out, and I looked for a new and improved one. I found this one with a really nice design and good specs, and I had to try one. I was not disappointed; this one has worked out great. First off, very easy to use. I like how there are nice cooking presets that make it easy and a good touchscreen control display where every function beeps and functions as soon as it is touched. I also like how I can adjust the time and the temperature manually as well. Secondly, I really like this basket. The basket has an insert that stands above the bottom of the bucket enough for air to circulate through. With that in mind, doing french fries, not only does the top get crispy, but so does the bottom too. The cooking is right on point for air fryer instructions on various foods that I have tried, including french fries, and cooked to perfection. I also like how the bucket is non-stick, and the food rolls out without sticking to the bottom. Lastly, I like how easily this one cleans up. All I do is remove the insert, stick it in the dishwasher along with the bucket, and it all comes back looking brand new again. No cons, it worked out great for me, and I am very happy with the purchase.",

It is attractive and smaller so I can leave it on the counter if I want to and I love that I can see inside while it's cooking.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. When my old air fryer kicked the bucket I replaced it pronto with this lil quick cooking gizmo. Not only does it make quick and oil-free healthy meals, but it also comes with a ton of great features that make it a must-have appliance in any kitchen (several features I didn't have on my old one).The easy view and smart 8 in 1 digital touchscreen is so convenient to use. It's super easy to navigate and select the perfect cooking settings for whatever I'm making. Whether I'm frying, roasting, or baking, this air fryer has a setting for it all.One feature that I absolutely love is the shake reminder (shake shake shake lol). It's so easy to forget to shake your food during cooking, but this air fryer takes care of that for you. It gives you a gentle reminder to shake your food halfway through the cooking process, ensuring that everything cooks evenly.Best feature - Cleaning up after cooking with this air fryer is a breeze. The non-stick basket is dishwasher-safe, making cleanup a quick and hassle-free experience.",

                "reviewText": "I was lucky enough to score a great deal on this air fryer for Black Friday and I\u2019ve been really happy with the performance since I got it. The basket is huge and the light is bright so it\u2019s easy to see how your food is doing. It\u2019s a nice looking countertop appliance. I like that it has a low beeping sound to let you know it\u2019s done. The actual cooking sound isn\u2019t that bad either!I haven\u2019t tried all the settings but it\u2019s been great so far, allowed me to get rid of my toaster. I\u2019ve used hand me down air fryers for the last 5 years \u2014 would for sure buy this as a house warming gift for anyone.There are a lot of bad reviews based on the fact that you have to follow the manual and do a first run through of the air fryer before using it. My recommendation\u2014 set it to run with all the windows open and have a fan on in the kitchen and not be there for 30mins. The chemical smell was gone within 30 when I did this. The smell was gone after doing this first cooking cycle. The manual explains why there\u2019s a smell. Not that big of a deal.",

I picked this model over other models on Prime because of the ratings, and it was on sale at the time. Really happy with the illuminated interface on the top of the unit, the window to be able to watch it fry, and after skimming the user manual had no problems getting started. So far, I've used it for things like chicken nuggets and strips, and what I do is follow the length of time suggested on the box, but I leave it at around 380 degrees. This results in a crispy, well-cooked product for the few things I've tried so far. It has presets for fries and other items, but I haven't tried them yet. Really impressed with this Bear Air Fryer, and I would recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I was lamenting to a neighbor about not being able to cook using my oven as it gets too hot in my tiny little apartment (The a/c will not work unless its warmer than +10 outside and I have a oxygen concentrator that puts out a lot of heat!) No a/c means no oven use. He told me of his air fryer. He was leaving town for Christmas so he let me borrow his while he was gone. Game-changer! Once I returned his to him I immediately ordered myself this one. It cooks all sorts of foods without heating up the apartment. And its cooks the foods in about half the time. Example: pre-cooked frozen chicken wings - 450 in the oven for 30 minutes, apartment a sauna for hours v/s 390 in the air fryer for about 15 minutes and no change to apartment temperature. I may never use my oven again! This unit is very easy to use. The instructions make it more confusing than it has to be - its worded very poorly. And it is very easy to clean. It comes with air-fryer liners which means for the most part just a quick wipe with paper towels and its clean. I have used it quite a few times for different foods and have not had to actually wash the basket yet. But that will depend on what you actually cook in it. Do preheat it and let it cool down at least 2 times before using it to cook to rid it of funky smell (its some kind of protective oil on the heating coil that is described in the instruction manual) It says to do this once but I did it twice as I dont want my food to taste funky - and it didn't, in fact the breaded chicken wings were tastier and crisper than if they were cooked in the oven. And you will not believe how well this unit cooks frozen french fries. In minutes to crispy perfection! Little bit of a learning curve as I cook different things and figure out times and temperatures. Word of caution; do not put the basket with a liner in the unit when it still has time left to cook with no food in it - the hot air blows the liner up against the heating coil. The liner didn't actually catch fire, it was the oil on the liner that got hot enough to smoke! And lots of it! It does mention that in the instruction manual, just a mistake on my part. If you not sure you need or would use an air fryer, you do and you will, I wish I had discovered how great they are much sooner. Better late than never!",
