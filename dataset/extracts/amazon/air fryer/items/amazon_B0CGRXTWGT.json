                "reviewText": "I really like this air fryer. My family is fairly large so with our old air fryer we had to cook about 1 plate at a time. This was not efficient and took forever to cook a meal for the whole family. This air fryer is much larger and it enables me to cook a meal for the family in much less time.There are lots of cooking preset options and they are all adjustable. The machine preset gives me a starting point and I can adjust the temperature, time and rotation on/off from that preset.I love the rotisserie. Its not huge. I can probably fit a small chicken in it if needed, but thats not usually what I would use an air fryer for. I think the rotisserie is much better sized to cook sausage, popcorn, pumpkin seeds, etc.The back of the air fryer has rubber bumper pads and there are rubber grips on the bottom of the unit. I think an improvement would be to have suction cups to attach to the countertop.Be careful not to scratch the glass. I noticed a scratch on my front glass. I didn't notice the scratch at first so I think I might have scratched the surface when opening the door. Its barely noticeable, but I will be more careful aout opening the door in the future.",

I\u2019ve been wanting an air fryer and a toaster oven, but just didn\u2019t know which to go with because we didn\u2019t have the space! When I came across this, I just knew I had to have it. I am so happy we got it! It\u2019s smaller than what I thought it would be, which is perfect for us. It\u2019s still large capacity and can do a lot. Very user-friendly and easy to use. Love all the different features. Comes with everything you need racks rotisserie basket. So happy and I highly recommend definitely would make a great gift.",

There was a great sear on the burgers, and they cooked really well...delicious! It's fairly easy to clean. I like all of the different cooking options and that you can control the temperature and time. I'm not crazy about the loud beep that goes off every time you do something.Unfortunately, the dark round pan came with a dent in it. But overall, with this fryer, I am happy with it.This product is made in China.I hope you found my review helpful!!",
