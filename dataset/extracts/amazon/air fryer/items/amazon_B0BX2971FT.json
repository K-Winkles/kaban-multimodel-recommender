                "reviewText": "I had to do a fair amount of scrubbing when they arrived due to a lot of that blush one sees on silicone items but once that was done they clean easily. They don't have a lot of capacity but if you read the description you know what you're getting. They work well, no odors, and they contain the food.The only caveat is you won't get any bottom browning. Most of the oven roasting I do is on a beautifully seasoned sheet pan so even with parchment the food gets a nice browning where it touches the pan, even as low as 325-350F. As expected, you won't get that with these. What you will get is a nice lip to contain any juices or marinades. So mushrooms and tomatoes and anything saucy can go on the same sheet pan as your dry roast ingredents without getting all over and it retains the saucy goodness.For my purposes it's a limited application but the times I do need it I'm glad to have it.",
