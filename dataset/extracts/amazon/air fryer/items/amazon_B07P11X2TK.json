                "reviewText": "I purchased this set to work alongside my Ninja Speedi, which has rapidly become a full oven replacement for us. All of the pieces fit in the Speedi beautifully, and this kit also includes a very nice air fryer recipe book! I've made brownies, cakes, and cookies with ease thanks to this set. Toast as well! The rack is handy too, especially for the speedi. Food seems to be a bit under cooked on the bottom when you use the rack, but that is most likely due to how my Speedi cooks food - I'm sure with practice I can get that resolved. The tongs are so strudy and useful; a must for grilled cheeses made the Speedi way. Overall, a magnificent purchase for Ninja Speedi and Air fryer users alike! Pictured here; a grilled cheese I made in the Speedi using the rack and tongs that came in this kit.",

                "reviewText": "After having many friends rave about their air fryers, and attending a lunch and learn about cooking with one, I decided to research air fryers and join the adventure. When ordering the Cosori Air Fryer, I thought it would be good to order some accessories so that I could do more with it right away. When I found the square air fryer accessories I decided to give it a try.The recipe book that comes with it has a nice assortment of 20 items. The tongs are solid feeling with silicone tipped ends. The 2 pans and 3 wire racks are all solid feeling. The silicone mat, grips, and cupcake sleeves appear to be well made.The only complaint that I have is the set was listed as being great for a square air fryer (which the shapes are fine for that) but they are smaller than I thought they would be. The air fryer I purchased makes these pieces look very small when placed inside it. Each item can be covered by my open hand (I have smaller hands). I should have grabbed a ruler to remind myself of what the dimensions were saying when I looked at ordering this set. I will still get use out of them, so they will not go unused.If I find that these items do not hold up well after continued use I will amend my review.",

I\u2019ve reheated or cooked pasta dishes , meats, vegetables in the pans and they were great .. easy to wash .. nonstick pans.. I do spray with Pam first.. Tongs are great to take sandwiches and other foods out of the basket. I feel it was a good purchase and good price.",

I\u2019ve tried prying the slots open more, but that\u2019s not helpful because I end up with a \u201cV\u201d slot. Maybe bread is sliced thinner overseas when compared to U.S.A.? Holds halved (skinny) pita pockets better. The tongs are short (9\u201d) but usable. The parchment paper-like liners have come in handy for a few recipes (frozen onion rings & frozen chicken tenders). I still need to use the other accessories in this kit (air fryer newbie here).",
