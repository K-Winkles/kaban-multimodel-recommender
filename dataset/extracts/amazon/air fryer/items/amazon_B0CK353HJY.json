                "reviewText": "Having never used an air fryer, I actually sat down and read the entire manual. Don't tell anybody that, as I have a reputation to uphold. There are a lot of dos and don'ts in the manual, take the time to read it. The product has a nice feel to it, with good fit and finish. There are nice touches, like the built bracket to wind the cord up onto for storage. During no part of the operation did any outside surface get too hot to touch, and it is reasonably quiet. I also appreciate the fact that it is UL listed. That is important to me. The design is lets you can keep an eye on the food, and airflow is such that the window stayed clear. Cleanup was surprisingly simple. The food tray comes apart into a couple of pieces, and they fit into the sink for washing. The control panel is easy to read, and it has a number of options. The instruction manual describes a number of accessories that are available. The package we ordered came with some paper cooking sheets. Our first meal was chicken breasts, cut up into small pieces, and breaded. It took two sessions to cook chicken for two adults. For larger meals, that might be a limiting factor, for others, it will be just perfect. The chicken came out tender, and it was not dry, with good flavor. We have not used this enough yet, to discuss other food types. But we will, and I will update this review. But for now, I can say that it is well-built, has some thoughtful touches, and if you are in the market for an air fryer, I don't find any downsides to this one.UPDATE: Feb 9th 2024. We have cooked Salmon, frozen vegetables, french fries, and tater tots. All have turned out well. However, portion sizes need to be small. Having to run two batches at 20 minutes each, means we just use the oven. Now, portion sizes required are a very personal thing. This is the perfect size for a single person, or at the most, a couple, where one of them isn't a pig like me! Based on our use, and knowing what we know now, we would have purchased a more conventional air fryer with a front opening door and a couple of shelves. Now, it is possible, that this manufacturer offers some accessories that might help - and I'll check that out. The directions showed several optional accessories, and those could well increase the utility. I'll check it out, and get back with you. In the meantime, it is working as advertised, and we have no complaints about the food quality.",

                "reviewText": "Yes, I know funner is not a word, but that's what the teenagers think this is.I've never had or used an air fryer before, so I have no idea how this rates to others.That being the case, we found this really easy to use. Our teenagers have used this at least 1/2 dozen times since we got it to make a bag of chicken wings. Just put one of the paper inserts in the basket, dump a bag of chicken wings in, hit power-air fry-start. It beeps halfway thru to remind you to shake or flip them.Things I like:* Comes with a lot of paper inserts* Very easy to clean* Intuitive controls* Instant start to cooking, no need to wait for an oven to heat up.* We like looking inside. Something weirdly satisfying about watching your food glow and cook up close.Things to know:* It is fairly loud. I measured with a sound level meter and it hovered around 72 dB (which is just above conversational speech). So it does add to the noise of the kitchen, if that is bothersome to you.* Like others have mentioned, we follow the directions of the machine, not the bag (it always tends to be more accurate).* It's bulky. (I don't think this is probably different than other airfryers, but I hadn't really considered space when ordering).* For us we still prefer to do fries in the oven, as it's hard to get them crisped up in this unless you are cooking a very small amount.",

                "reviewText": "I threw a bunch of artery clogging food at this thing last night. It cooked them very well, but there was a trick to it. It seems dumb, but it's simple. Follow the directions and time on the fryer, not on the food. The fries I tossed in the fryer wanted 10-12 minutes to cook according to the bag, but the fryer wanted to cook them 18 minutes. Long story short, the fryer won, requiring the full 18 minutes to cook. The same story was true for some chickie nuggies. Moral of the story, the fryer knows.After completing an initial, very stinky burn in cycle to remove the factory oils, we were ready to go, approximately 20 minutes.What I really like about this fryer is the ability to pull out the food, shake it up really quick, then plop it back in and it keeps cooking. Works great for bag fries.A slightly annoying feature is the constant beeps after 1-2 minutes reminding you to shake/flip. I haven't quite figured out the schema to when it beeps, but sometimes it's a little too much. 4-5 long beeps, constantly. It'll drive you insane. I'm not docking a star but it was close.Once I figured out the cook times, it's making perfectly crisp foods, and will definitely become my new favorite appliance for junk food.Worth noting, this is a 1500 watt appliance. Ensure your electrical system can handle it. Also, the fryer does throw a little bit of heat around it's base. I have granite counter tops so it was no issue, but you might want to monitor if you have formica countertops.",
