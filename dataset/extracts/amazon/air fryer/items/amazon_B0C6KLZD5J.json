If for no other reason than I never want to see my airfryer so dirty again. I have a a Bella airfryer and these sheets don\u2019t fit perfectly but fit okay and it is still worth it. It is super easy to take out the sheets and put that in for the next use. I am able to open the air fryer put in a new sheet, use the air fryer, and then easily remove the sheet. Even though these are not the correct fit, the sheets, keep my air fryer clean. I am able to use my air fryer more frequently, and without the headache of a massive cleanup.",
