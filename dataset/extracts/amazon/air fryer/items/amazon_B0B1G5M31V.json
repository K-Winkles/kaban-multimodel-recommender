                "reviewText": "This is the first pressure cooker ive ever used so I was really intimidated at first, but using this was so easy. I love all the safety features, that was my main concern. Just taking it out of the box I could tell it was a high quality, build to last, type of product. The price is definitely worth it. The different functions make cooking so convenient. If I need to saut\u00e9 something before slow cooking, I can just throw all my ingredients in and do both using the same pot. My favorite feature is the stainless steel pot, this means I dont have to worry about the scratches, wear, and peeling you get when using non stick pots.The first time I used this I cooked the most tender port shoulder, in only 30 minutes! The clean up was surprising. I was expecting a mess when opening in the lid but there was none. It didnt even need any scrubbing, just a quick soapy rinse.I definitely recommend this pressure cooker. The quality is amazing, and the size is perfect for my 2 person household. The leftovers lasted for almost a week! The cooking and clean up couldn't be any easier. Im excited to learn and try some more recipes on this.",

                "reviewText": "I have a big pressure cooker that I never use - too fussy, too much work, I never know how long I should cook stuff, whether it's pressurized enough to start counting yet or not, etc. Plus it's too big for me alone.I have been hesitating on the IP for a long time. I was waiting for the Ultra 3qt to come back, but it seems like that's not going to happen. SO I finally caved to peer pressure (ah!) and got this one instead.And oh, my. YES. SO MUCH YES.I haven't done much yet, but the simple fact that I can finally steam veggies as much as I want to with zero fuss, next to zero dishes, and with barely any work, have more than sold it on me. In a week, I've eaten stuff I love but almost never cook.Steamed cauliflower and broccoli? Check.Steamed whole artichoke? Check.Favorite French beef stew that I only ever get to eat when I go back home? Check.Chicken soup? Check.Very few dishes? Check.Clean kitchen? Check.Food prep in the morning because you can delay the start or slow cook with no supervision? Check.This little baby is now my Air Fryer's best friend, and the rest of my cookware hates them. My stovetop too. I cook a whole meal and end up with one pot to clean (or two if I used the steamer basket) that doesn't need actual scrubbing, plus the air fryer's basket, and the cutting board. That's it.All that being said, I wish it had a few things it doesn't:- Ability to set the temperature lower (in yogurt mode) so I could make fromage blanc ( a cross between yogurt and fresh cultured soft cheese),- Higher saut\u00e9 temp. As it is, it's barely hot enough to sear anything.Oh, and get yourself a steamer basket. It comes with a trivet that will hold big food chunks out of the water, but the keywork here is *big* chunks - and it's *below* the food, so good luck taking it all out. If you want to actually steam stuff, get a steaming basket. Also negates the need for a colander.I also got the silicon lid, so I can put the leftovers in the fridge directly without having to transfer them. You will also need some kind of mitt because the pot can get hot and doesn't have a handle.",

                "reviewText": "If you live in a neighbourhood where your packages might get stolen off your front porch I recommend asking for extra/gift packaging in checkout because mine was shipped in the bright red Instant Pot box. This is my first pressure cooker and first instant pot. I live alone in a very small apartment so I got this one over the 6QT and that was definitely the right idea. Packaged with the instant pot itself is a very thorough manual, an extra rubber seal for the lid, and plug. Cleaned everything and ran it through a water-only test run with no problems. The screen is bright and easy to read and the buttons are all clearly labelled. There are a lot of settings that I will probably never use, but so far I've made an easy beef stew with it and I'm very impressed with how quick it is compared to a slow cooker. Remains to be seen how long it will stand up to use over time, hopefully it will live up to the instant pot reputation for being long-lasting. Recently the cost of the 3QT models has been going up so if you're considering it you're probably better off grabbing one now than trying to wait for a deal.",
