                "reviewText": "So good is this air fryer it's used at least twice a day preparing warm lunches or dinners in fractions of the time it takes to cook on a stove from vegetables, meat, fish and more. Furthermore, no smoke filled kitchen when we cooked beef on a grill pan on the stove.If you can live without grill marks on your meats, compared to evenly cooked air fryer meats, then Cosori is for you.",
