The 13.4\u201d x 11.4\u201d size fits and has been working well for the air fryer setting. It's been pretty non stick so far and easy to clean compared to some wire/roasting racks that I have also tried. Overall this seems like a good option for many of the ovens with air fryer function.",

I am not sure how well the \"coating\" will last or how durable it will be in the long run, but the quality seems decent.I do wish the grid was a bit smaller / tighter (smaller holes) as some of the items I put in it tend to want to fall into the holes and / or stick in the holes.I would buy this again.",

                "reviewText": "While the idea of a separate air fryer sounds appealing, the reality is that a stand-alone air fryer 1. it's too small for more than 1 person, and 2. it's not a small appliance - one needs to find a home for it when not using.I can't believe I didn't think of looking this up sooner. It's fantastic. I'm glad I purchased the larger size. The first meal we made was loaded zucchini skins (like potato skins but zucchini). Let me tell you - delicious!I laid a piece of foil in the bottom pan to catch any drippings, and sprayed the mesh with cooking spray - easy as pie to clean up. Knocked off some of the cheese that dripped and then everything got tossed in the dishwasher.Highly recommend if you're wanting to do some air frying using your convection oven.",
