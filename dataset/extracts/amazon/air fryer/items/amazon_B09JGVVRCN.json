                "reviewText": "Okay, had to come write a review because I know I would have appreciated reading it! Haha!I specifically chose this air fryer because of the window, and I\u2019m so glad I did. It is literally the bomb! I did a lot of research and read tons of reviews. I didn\u2019t go for the XL drawer style because I heard they were a challenge to clean, and I honestly didn\u2019t need that much space. But I wanted something bigger than a 5qt. So I got this 8qt. Honestly, I thought it would be bigger? But it\u2019s still a good size and DEF wouldn't go smaller. Basically all the reviews I read had lovers and haters. But overall I decided to give it a try. Some said it smelled like plastic. But another reviewer mentioned after cleaning the basket per instructions, they took it outside and ran it through a few cycles. I did the same. It had a slight smell, but nothing crazy. After I brought it in and it cooled, I tried my first experiment of frozen pretzels with pepperoni and cheese. It said 400 for 15 on the box. I have watched so many videos by now I knew to decrease everything. So I chose 350 for 5 mins and that was \u2018just\u2019 perfect\u2019!!! I probably could have done 4 mins! WATCHING THROUGH THE WINDOW WAS GOLDENNNNNN!!!! My word!!!! Get this one!!! I love it! I can\u2019t wait to try something else in it!!! The other common complaint was chipping of the coating. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0fInstructions say\u2026no aerosol oil sprays!!! So yeah, I see people on YT using Pam? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0fSo, yeah, don\u2019t do that and maybe it won\u2019t chip! Walmart and TJ\u2019s has a Avocado non-aerosol spray high smoke point. Bam! Get it! This seems super well made, considering. I know it\u2019s not a super expensive appliance\u2026but it does the job. It will pay for itself, not having to run my oven. The digital pad is quiet. The noise of the fryer is very quiet. It was pretty hot after running it a few times at 400 for 10-15 mins. So put it in a good place. I had to wait for it to cool down before I could move it. It has the 4 preset settings, which I think will basically be a short cut to the temp you want and easily adjusted with the buttons. I barely had to press them, was great! I\u2019m super excited about the possibilities and can\u2019t wait to try some more stuff. I\u2019ll come back and update later with how it\u2019s going after awhile. I think after all my research\u2026this is a good one! The window\u2026seriously guys, it\u2019s the best! \u2705\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\udf89 Oh, btw, pretzel was awesome and totally cooked through and soft\u2026in 5 mins from frozen! This is gonna be amazing!!\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffcUpdate-Almost two months in, and still loving it. Now I KNOW the window is a must! Like, how do other Air Fryers not do this, if it\u2019s possible? Working great, easy to clean. Use it all the time! Would absolutely buy it again. Only thing wrong so far\u2026the Logo is rubbing off right where I use my thumb to pull the drawer out. Not a big deal, I actually tried to just rub the whole thing off, will have to work at it. But maybe the Manufacturer can put it somewhere else? Other than that\u2026awesomeness continues! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc One other note, I was worried that since this model doesn\u2019t have the \u2018basket\u2019 type you couldn\u2019t \u2018pour it out\u2019 because the bottom tray would come out? That was wrong. You can pour it out just like the basket ones. The silicone stoppers hold the tray down snug enough for you to pour your fries into a bowl. Just FYI, if you were worried about it. :) No need to worry, works great, less stuff to clean!\u2705Almost a year now! Use it\u2026I\u2019d say pretty much every week for something! Window is still my favorite. Touch screen on top is another thing I do like.Unfortunately, the rubber stoppers have been breaking off one by one. Poor design. The little spikes that hold them in place just end up getting cut over time with all the in and out, and thus\u2026break off. So now I have two spots in the basket where the nonstick has come off\u2026and I\u2019m sure will start to rust. Technically it\u2019s not touching the food. But overall, if they came up with a new design for those tabs, it\u2019d work better. Now I always have to hold the bottom in with a spoon or something when I dump the basket, so I\u2019d doesn\u2019t fall out.Still love it. Maybe I can get new rubber stoppers?",

                "reviewText": "Every aspect of this machine is extraordinary. You Set It and Forget It. Everything turns out perfectly cooked. Whether it be frozen solid chicken or fresh chicken it always comes out crispy on the outside and completely cooked & juicy on the inside. Vegetables, whether frozen or fresh come out done exactly right, every time. It's cooks so fast that you start making multi-dish meals just to show off. And Clean Up? LOL ... seriously, it almost makes dish washing fun, it's so easy.The only drawback is that everything is done so quickly, easily and perfectly, that I started making so many different things just to see how they would turn out, I couldn't possibly eat it all. I love this machine.By the way, I'm a 73 single guy who had given up cooking for Subs, Fast Food Burgers, Pizza and frozen dinners because of the hassles of clean up and cooking for myself. BUT, now I'm back in the cooking game and loving it",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m 59, old school and like to keep it simple but I also enjoy having the latest and greatest. After 40 years of cooking three meals a day for my family now it\u2019s just me and my husband. We also have a small daycare\u2026.this thing is a game changer!! Its stupid easy to use, so easy to clean and the quality is top notch. The highest temperature is 400 but trust me that\u2019s as high as you need it to be. The controls could not be easier they are simple straightforward. I cooked frozen french fries in this thing. Amazing! in the oven I think it takes 20 minutes it was 10 minutes and halfway through it has this shake alert so you can pull it out shake it around and I know it says one layer but when I cooked the fries it was more than one layer and they turned out perfect. But you have to remember this you can\u2019t use any aerosol cooking spray\u2026.get a pump sprayer on Amazon and use avocado oil. Do your research on oils\u2026vegetable and canola oils\u2026.you should get that crap out of your diet ASAP. Spray it lightly on the removable rack and brush it around or toss your food in a little oil. I mean a little. You will be surprised just how little oil you need. Clean up is a breeze\u2026.pull the basket, remove the rack and wash. But you can\u2019t use drippy batters like tempura or a batter like for onion rings. Also remember it\u2019s not going to be like deep frying but honestly I\u2019m from the south, I grew up on fried foods in the cast iron skillet and fried chicken in this thing comes in at a very close second. I cooked red potatoes and a pork tenderloin and it was better than in my cast-iron skillet. Thin chicken breasts dipped in egg then a seasoned flour mixture\u2026soooo good! And seriously! Check out this price! What\u2019s not to love about this thing! Nothing. Absolutely nothing! Get yourself an air fryer cook book to really get a lot of use out of this. Healthier than frying, great price, easy to clean. This is the one you want.",

                "reviewText": "This model was a little bigger and taller than I expected, and it can suit 1-2 people, maybe 3 if you want a portable model. I'm using it practically every day for a variety of foods. If you have soups or greasy foods I suggest you get a tinfoil container (from any dollar store) to fit inside the basket. I also bought a backup pack of the little rubber grips that hold the inside panel. This model is easy to use with a knob controlling temperature and time. Just make sure to unplug the air fryer when not in use! I also recommend that if you have shelves above the air fryer to angle it away from the shelves (when cooking) as it does blow out hot air through the back. However, using the air fryer definitely creates less heat in the room compared to an oven or gas stove. So far, I've cooked vegan meats, samosas, potatoes, veggies (in tin foil), soup (in tin foil, toast, pakoras, frozen meals, dumplings in water in a tin, and corn cobs. I especially love making toast so easily using the air fryer. It's easy to wipe down the fryer, and to wash the basket and inside panel. As additional information, I researched before I bought as I needed a good quality but lower wattage fryer for an old house with old wiring and so far so good!",
