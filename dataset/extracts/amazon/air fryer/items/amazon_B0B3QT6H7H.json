                "reviewText": "I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this rapid cooker from Ninja. I have their outdoor woodfire grill, and the outdoor woodfire oven, so when I was able to purchase this I almost didn't thinking the last thing I needed was another kitchen appliance. I am SO GLAD I went for the purchase! This cooker is so different that the others I mentioned as it truly is capable of cooking an all in one meal for myself and my husband as well as our family when they come for dinner. I was a bit nervous with learning how to use this because of all the different settings, but it is really easy. I did go on YouTube to watch how to use it and then I watched many of the cooks make different meals, so that is really helpful. There is also a great app that Ninja offers where you just add your base, protein, veggies, spices, etc... and it formulates a recipe with instructions on how to cook it. It is very easy to clean. It is large for the counters, but well worth the loss of space. However, what I do is put a large cutting board over my stovetop and place the Ninaji on there to cook. It works like a charm. My best advice is to purchase it and search \"how tos\" on Youtube and Instagram for more instruction. It is such a game changer!!",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE my Ninja Speedi.I live in the South It\u2019s HOT. Cooking on a stovetop or in an oven makes it unbearable. This is my first countertop cooking appliance. I am THRILLED to have it. I am older and gun shy to pressure cookers. I LOVE being able to lift the lid to check on things. It cooks delicious full meals with NO added heat in the house, few pots and pans, (if any) and in less time. There are so many options. I am having fun learning the ins and outs of cooking with it. The air fryer is amazing. Switching from one method to another is super easy! A flip of a switch and a change to temp/time settings. I baked a chocolate cake that was very moist and dangerously delicious. The 6 quart is PERFECT for my husband and I. We usually have leftovers when I make a Speedi Meal. The app for the meal builder is very helpful for finding a recipe on the fly. My Speedi lives on my counter in my small kitchen. I GLADLY give up the space to have this Ninja in my kitchen.",

I have been using air fryers for over 3 years and they are definitely convenient and they save you a lot of money in energy bills. However, this speedy meal feature is a game changer. It works very well for my little family of 3 and given that we usually don't eat huge meals. I have tasted different options, but my favourite so far has been asparagus. They are much better than grilled asparagus! Chicken breast also cooks nicely.",
