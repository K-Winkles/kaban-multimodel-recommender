                "reviewText": "This is going to be a long review because this thing is incredible but if you want the quick summary its awesome and well worth the 169 (with the coupon as of today).Let's get into the details,First off, this air fryer is feature rich and features two heating zones that are totally independent of each other so you can be cooking two things at different temps and have different cooking times. You can even have the air fryer, via the app, sync the cooking times so if you got a dish on the top that takes 40 minutes to cook and one on the bottom that takes 20 minutes it will start with the 40 minute one and then turn on the lower one when there is 20 min left so that they both finish at the same time. I didn't think I would use this feature but being able to cook two things at once is not only a major time saver but having them all done at the same time is amazing. I had chicken tenders on the top for my kids and cheese sticks on the bottom, of course the tenders took longer than the cheese sticks but with this air fryer they both finished at the same time.Second, this thing is spot on temp wise, I have used both the top and bottom and had a remote temp probe I use for cooking steaks to check the temps and the prob and the display on the top were within 3 degrees of each other, it also recovered very quickly when I opened the door and because it has sensors on both doors it killed the power for safety and resumed the second the door was closed again. I also like that it won't turn on if the door is open which is super nice for when you got young kids. The air fryer I was using before didn't care if the tray was pushed in or out when you turned the dial it turned on.Third, the interface on the unit itself is easy to use and each cooking area has its own display for temp and is easy to setup and configure. The buttons on top are capacitive so the surface is smooth and really easy to keep clean.Fouth, the Wi-Fi and the app, getting this paired to the Smart Home app was very each and the app both looks nice and is easy to use (be sure you got a 2.4ghz network available). Setting the temps and times for each cooking area is fast and easy via the app and it even has a receipt section where you can select what you are cooking and it will pre-load what it feels is the best for the item. The app will also display information such as temp and time left for each cooking area as its running and this is where you can set the time sync so that both cooking areas finish at the same time.Fifth, the fact you can cook two things at one time is one of the best features of this air-fryer, the top basket is huge, you can fit a lot into that area including an entire chicken or a whole bunch of tenders iand what not. The bottom one is great for warming up leftovers like tacos or giving a sandwich bun a nice toast, but it can also do things like wings, cheese sticks, poppers...whatever will fit as it has the same temp range as the top unit.Sixth, it's a stacked design and not a side by side so while its tall it takes up way less of a footprint then a double unit and even with its larger internal size basket compared to my old one it didn't take up all that much more space because it's pretty compact for its size. Yes you do need a decent spot on your counter for this but it's nothing crazy, If you have a Keurig or a Ninja Coffee machine it's about 1.5 times bigger than those for a point of reference.Finally, you got a lot of options on this unit at the top and in the app you got Air Fryer mode, Grill, Dehydrate, bake, roast, broil, reheat and toast. Each one of those sets some predefined temps and fan speeds, I have used air fryer numerous times and dehydrated some pineapple rings and it did a good job on both. I probably won't use the other features as I have a pretty sweet countertop oven that is able to handle an entire pizza and what not but if you want a true all in one device this will have you covered.So that is what I like about the air fryer but a final thing I wanted to talk about was the brand and manufacture Midea and my experience with other products that have. Midea is the largest producer of appliances in the world and make solid products. I have 3 Midea u-shaped Window AC's unit as well as Midea fridge I got at the big box hardware store that is themed in blue as well as a Midea Washer and Dryer and they have been solid. I will also note that when I did have an issue with one of my Midea u-shaped window units they stood by their warranty and sent me out a brand-new unit. I didn't have to return the old unit and they even covered the cost at the recycling center where I dropped the broken unit off at since it contained refrigerant and couldn't be throw away in the trash. So, the company itself is solid and they have sold a lot of units, check out other sites for their other products and you will see they all have pretty good reviews and ratings.So that's it, this is the best air fryer I have ever used and would highly recommend it for anyone in the market for one.",

                "reviewText": "This unit makes amazingly delicious and juicy pieces of meat!!! I am totally in love with my new dual air fryer!! I love the fact that it has two different baskets which are large capacity and fit anything from a nice large chicken to a big piece of roast or some steaks. The unit is super easy to use with self-explanatory, touch, screen buttons. The unit itself is not too heavy, or bulky, considering that it has two baskets, and fits right under my kitchen cabinet. I love it that it has a touchscreen button so you can turn the light on or leave it off, allowing you to view your cooking, I threw some frozen chicken breasts into the top baskets seasoned them up with a little butter and some condiments, closed the unit for 37 minutes, and didn\u2019t even have to turn my food. Incredible!!! The second basket gives you the flexibility of literally cooking an entire meal within one unit in a super convenient amount of time. It was also very easy to connect my unit to Wi-Fi. This is a must have item if you enjoy cooking and you enjoy using different kitchen gadgets. To top it all off, everything is dishwasher safe also! I\u2019m super happy!",

                "reviewText": "This air fryer does so much more than just air fry! It is very large, so make sure you have the counter space for it!! It has so many different features including dehydrate, roast and many others and you will find yourself using it a lot! I absolutely love the features built in. It has a synchronizing feature so the upper and lower areas end at the same time and the machine will even pause and alert you when it's time to turn your food.It is very nice being able to separate items you wish to roast while cooking things in the air basket at the same time. The one drawback is you do have to set your cook times a little bit longer when using both, but a small price to pay for everything done at once. This would be on par with high-end Ninja appliances and it does way more! You can't beat this for the price, highly recommend!",

It is also quite heavy, weighing over 20 pounds! It is also a well-made, brilliantly designed air fryer. You have two air fryers: one at 6 quarts, another at 5 quarts. They each function independently, so that you can plan a whole meal. If you use the app, you can even access the unit remotely and sync your two items to finish at the same time! My wife and I love its depdenability and versatility.",
