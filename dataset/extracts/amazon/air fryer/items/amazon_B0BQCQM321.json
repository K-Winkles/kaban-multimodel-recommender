With Brio, your food comes out perfectly crispy every time.",
            "EVEN HEATING \u2013 The NuWave Brio\u2019s unique cooking chamber ensures that the super-heated air generated by the Brio circulates around your food, cooking it from all sides at the same time. This is facilitated by the patented Fry Pan Basket design with its stainless-steel meshed basket net and holes in the basket walls to ensure the hot air cooks your food from every direction.",
            "ADVANCED FEATURES \u2013 The NuWave Brio has a vast temperature range between 100\u00b0F and 400\u00b0F, adjustable in 5\u00b0F increments with the simple press of a button.

            "CONVENIENT \u2013 The Brio 6-Quart is the perfect size for cooking two pounds of fries or a 3.5-pound chicken, by making it the perfect choice for couples, small families or anyone that wants to enjoy healthier fried food made quick and easy.

We bought the second unit for our travel trailer and can run it when we are off grid at the 500w setting.Our home unit can run from the same socket as the microwave, we just run it on the lower settings.You can warm it up at 1800w, then lower to 500w and run the microwave etcIts been reliable, easy to use, and versatile",
