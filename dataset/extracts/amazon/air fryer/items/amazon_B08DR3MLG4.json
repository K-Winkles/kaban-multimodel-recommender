                "reviewText": "Okay, so I really loved this thing. I ordered it back in July, and have had no complaints\u2026 it\u2019s easy to use, worked great, it\u2019s super cute\u2026 I actually really enjoyed using it. Then one day it stopped working. No reason, no warning\u2026 it\u2019s just dead. I used it 2-3 times per week, so it wasn\u2019t excessively used or abused in any way. It\u2019s easily one of my favorite kitchen gadgets, so it\u2019s really a shame that it quit working.",

Big frit lover here and total positive difference with regular convection oven I have. Truly crispy as wanted. Since then, I tried many other items and all much better then I had hoped. I\u2019m now a believer in air fryers.",
