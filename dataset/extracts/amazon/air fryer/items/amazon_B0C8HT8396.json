                "reviewText": "Purchased this air-fryer because our old air-fryer's heating element quit working. And we are all glad that it did quit on us because it allowed us to get this great and versatile Whall air-fryer oven. The oven is easy to use and has plenty of room to cook enough of what we want for a family of four. In our old air fryer you would have to cook fries/tater tots/chicken nuggets in batches to feed everyone but not with this air-fryer. It has two shelves that holds more that enough food for a family and can cook it all at once. The shelves can go right into the dishwasher (like all the accessories) for easy clean up. The only cleaning problem we have encountered is that small bits of food will get caught in the grooves that are in the bottom of the door. Still not a big deal for the time it saves us when we use the oven.We have cooked many things in this oven from air-fried chicken to air-fried fish to mac and cheese and they have all come out great. We haven't had a chance to use the rotisserie of the air-fryer so I can't really comment on that yet. But if it is anything like the ease of use we have had so far i will assume it will work just as well as the other items we have cooked.In all, this is just a great oven for the family, because of it's ease of operation, ease of cleaning, and the ease of cooking enough food quickly for a busy family.",

                "reviewText": "We have several friends who swear by the convenience and optimal cooking results of an air fryer (also known as a \"convection oven\"). On the other hand, some of our friends think their purchase of one was a waste of money. So, I decided to give one a try myself.The user (cook) interface of this oven is really nice. The backlit icons are very intuitive and make it easy to use the programmed cook times and temperatures. It's not super heavy and that's a good thing. We don't have a lot of countertop space in our kitchen. So, when we're not using the oven we store it on top of one of the kitchen cabinets.So far, we've cooked French fries, pork chops, and chicken wings in it. I've also baked cookies in it. My friends who love it say that it does wonders with chicken wings. For me, the first time with the chicken wings and the French fries was disappointing. The fries weren't as crispy as we were expecting. I don't think I sprayed them with enough vegetable oil. Subsequent tries turned out a little better, but fries are still a work in progress. The chicken wings didn't cook evenly. I was expecting that the circulating hot air would ensure even cooking. What I discovered is that when I use two cooking trays I still need to turn the wings periodically and swap the tray positions to help them cook evenly. Plus, I had to tweak the programmed cooking times and temp for chicken. They take a little longer to cook for me than the included cooking guide states.One thing that I wish was a little better is the depth of the bottom tray that collects the meat drippings. I wish it was deeper because it gets pretty close to overflowing most of the time. I actually have to stop the oven, take the drip tray out, dump the drippings and put the tray back in before resuming cooking. That's kind of a pain. On the other hand, the inside of the oven is easy to clean between uses.For those of you keeping score, here's the breakdown:Design- B+Construction- APracticality- BControls- B+Quality of Instructions- A-Ease of Use- BEase of Care- B+Safety- AValue- B+Overall Grade: B+",
