But our first attempt with actually cooking, it produced perfectly crisp fries; and no flipping. I like that it has a light so that you can see your food inside the fryer. The instructions and menu were easy to follow and there are a lot of preset options. This is our first Air Fryer so I don't know how it compares to other brands. But out of the box, we like it and will enjoy experimenting with other menu items.",

The outside is a hard plastic and the directions started out confusing because we couldn\u2019t find the start button-(Umm plug it in lol)- it lit up all of the buttons and I took off from there- now carefully following the first time directions- I started the 1st step of setting it at 400 degrees, it did the job (new air fryer smell) - I then moved up the temperature to 500 it took that temperature it without a problem. It is pretty big; it has a large pot opening and should easily feed 2-3 people and very easy to clean- I'm so excited and looking forward to healthier cooking and eating. Cool and well-made product!",

It has preset settings for different food items and a custom mode where you can set the temp and time frame. The standard temp on turn on is 300F but it can go lower than that. I cooked eggs to soft boiled in here on 270F. One of the features I love the most is how the timer is displayed on the handle.",
