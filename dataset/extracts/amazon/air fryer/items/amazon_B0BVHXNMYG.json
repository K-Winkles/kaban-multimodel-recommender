                "reviewText": "We ordered the silicone air fryer liners specifically for our new Ninja AF161 Max XL Air Fryer (5.5 quart capacity). As you can see from the attached photos, they fit perfecly in the Ninja 5.5-quart model. We haven't had a lot of experience using them yet, but I can report that they make the cleanup process a lot easier -- which is undoubtedly the main reason for using them. So far, we've been cleaning them by hand after removing most of what's left in liner after cooking. We have also experimented with disposable parchment paper liners purchased on Amazon -- following certain posted guidelines to avoid using parchment during the preheating process. At this point, we prefer using the silicone liners. I'll update my review as we become more experienced and knowledgeable with our air fryer. Apparently, we're late to the air-fryer party, and a have a lot of catching up to do. In the meantime, I'd rate these at a solid 4.5, rounding up to 5 stars. Be sure to comparison shop on price, since there are many options for sale on Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using the paper liners, which are cool, but still a little messy and don't always keep the entire inside of the basket clean. This did! I made breaded zucchini in the air fryer and only had to remove the silicone liner. There was zero spillage for me to clean up in the basket. The paper liners aren't really eco-friendly, either, so I feel better about the silicone being washable and resusable. And with four, if it goes in the dishwasher and isn't washed right away, I can still use another one to make something else in the fryer before I HAVE to wash one.",

I like they are re-useable. And the fact they come in a 4 pack for what you usually pay for 2 is a double bonus. The colors are great too.",

                "reviewText": "A little bit smaller than the drawer of my Power XL air fryer, but it gets the job done! Does an \"ok\" job of trapping oil in the groves in the bottom. These liners may not be the best choice when cooking greasy foods, like chicken wings, because the food will sit in the excess drippings/oil. I love the easy clean-up! Just let it cool, use a paper towel to scrape the grease into the trash, then pop the liner in the dishwasher.",
