                "reviewText": "I unboxed it and everything that was supposed to be included was included. I had a bad experience with one that I returned.I began by making toast. It is not easy to ruin toast. Well, it came out almost perfectly [The bread was refrigerated - my error]. I will adjust the wire rack next time to a higher level and reduce the time from 6 minutes to 5 minutes. So far 5 stars out of 5.Next, I grilled a frozen, pre-cooked sausage patty. I pre-heated the oven, but reduced the time to 6 minutes. I put the patty on the grill tray and put it on the lowest level, using the \"steak\" setting for 4 minutes. It came out perfectly. Again, 5 stars out of 5.NOTE: I did add a sheet of aluminum foil [shiny side down] on the drip tray to keep it as clean as possible. No effect on time, temperature or result. There was no information about using aluminum foil in the instructions, so I felt that it would be OK.Then I used the \"air fry\" setting. I put 8 frozen chicken nuggets in the wire basket, set the oven for \"wings\" [the nuggets are small like wings], set the pre-heat to 5 minutes and set the time to 10 minutes. Pre-heat went off and I put the wire basket on the second level from the bottom and anxiously waited for the 10 minute timer to finish. Not to my amazement, they also came out perfectly. I added some hot sauce for flavor. Once again, 5 stars out of 5.NOTE: These were not home made. Over the weekend when I have more time, I will make chicken nuggets from scratch.Pros: Easy to use. Easy to clean. The only 2 knobs [Temperature and Time] are well lit from the back, easy to see and easy to turn. The food comes out perfectly cooked. It is very easy to adjust the Temperature and/or Time. The instructions are clear with black and white drawings.Con: As hard as I tried, I was not able to teach the oven to walk my dog or fill out my tax returns and I am not able to give it 10 stars.This is a BIG WINNER. Buy one. You will not be sorry.Well here is the weekend. I made an egg and heavy cream wash and rolled some chicken in Panko crumbs with some spices. Turned the air fryer on, used the settings for chicken. Perfect.",

I\u2019ve been looking at air fryers for months and finally decided on TinTalk.

So far I\u2019ve cooked frozen french fries and they came out superb! I cooked chicken breast last night and it came out ok but only because I need to get use to the correct temperature and time which I\u2019ll work out after using it awhile.

                "reviewText": "I purchased this to replace my broken toaster oven and I've been waiting a few weeks to write the review, specifically, before I tried out a few of the recipes in the book that comes with the air fryer. Because of that, I had thought that there was something wrong with the appliance because nothing was coming out right. So far, I have attempted to make the Apple Crisps, Mozarella Sticks, Banana Bread, Sweet Potato Fries and the German Pancakes.All of them came out WRONG.The German Pancakes were underbaked (liquid in the middle). The Apple Crisps were soggy. Mozarella Sticks were stodgy. Sweet Potato Fries, limp and the Banana Bread was undercooked in the middle. Luckily, I have some experience when it comes to baking, so my second time around, attempting some the same recipes, I made adjustments. My sweet potato fries are delicious and my husband finished my banana nut loaf in two days. Needless to say, do not rely on the recipe book (I am sure a lot of information was hurried/omitted to keep it looking attractive) but take the time to visit other cooking website or rely on your own cooking knowledge. For example, I don't think there is any appliance in the world that can cook a loaf of banana bread in 30 minutes at a low temp.When cooking other things, such as tator-tots, veggie chicken nuggets, corn dogs, etc. the air fryer works extremely well! You can keep using the same temperature you would usually when cooking things like these, simply take it out of the air fryer a few minutes earlier.For that, I lowered the stars in the \"Easy to Use\" category because you, most of the time, have to watch your food until you learn/memorize what settings, cooking temps and cooking times to adjust. Once I become more familiar with the product, I'm sure I will love it. Right now, it is an adventure.",

                "reviewText": "I use this airfryer oven for every meal almost. It definitely saves time compared to stove/gas cooking. I have reheated pizza and toasted bread. I used the grilling function out on semifrozen salmon which worked beautifully compared to using the stove oven. Also fried some pork. It comes with a bottom tray to catch oil and crumbs.The size is decent and easy to clean with no extra hard to reach corners or ridges. Also love how the buttons surface is easy to clean and press.This thing comes with the mitt and lots of accessories too. I have yet to try the rotisserie function. Will update in the future if I ever do. My first time owning something like this and i feel it's definitely nice that this thing is everything you need for cooking all in one.",

                "reviewText": "This air fryer took me a long time to settle on and after ready so many reviews for the \u201cbig name\u201d air fryer oven combos, I was frustrated to say the least. I saw this one with just a few reviews but all were positive and I decided to give it a shot and so far it has been a wonderful purchase! I\u2019m still learning the timing on some of my favorite things, but it cooks evenly and I\u2019d very quiet. It feels sturdy and is all metal with no plastic parts, which is great. I\u2019ve only had it a few days but everything has come out great! Highly recommend this oven. The only bad thing I will say is that the website for the company is lacking alot and they don\u2019t seem to have replacement pieces but I doubt you will need them\u2026 just something to think of. Otherwise, this is a wonderful product.",
