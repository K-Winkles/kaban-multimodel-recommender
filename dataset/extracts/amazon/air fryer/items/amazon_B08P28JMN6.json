Cooks steaks very nicely, in fact everything I have attempted has come out perfect. And I'm no Julia Childs by any stretch of the imagination!!! I use it almost daily and it performs like a pro. Arrived as promised, nice packaging to protect the unit, no issues understanding the instructions. I highly recommend this fryer for couples or singles, too small for a family of 3.",

I received an Amazon gift card that would pretty much cover the cost of the item, so I took the plunge. I am pleasantly surprised and use it a lot. It is awesome for bacon!!! Easy to use and easy to clean. It is just my husband and I and I primarily use it for meat at this point. It will be great in the wintertime for meats when the snow is blowing outside! The color matches my kitchen cabinets perfectly so that helped sway my decision. It works great and I am very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "To be honest, I really wasn't expecting much. My beloved Cosori was under recall, and I looked for one of the least expensive air fryers available, so that I could still cook my daily \"hash browns\" for breakfast.Well, considering that Cosori has more than fumbled the football by making me wait 2 months for a replacement, and the fact that this little air fryer actually out performs the Cosori, this might be the airfryer that reigns supreme in my Kitchen.The small size of this fryer means there is almost no need to \"preheat\" the unit. It is much quieter than my Cosori, and the touch screen controls are intuitive and responsive.The system does not have a \"dual basket\" system, but instead has an \"screen insert\" which simply raises the product about 1/4 inch off the bottom to allow airflow underneath. It works fantastic. And is much easier to clean than Cosori's two basket system. I've done French Fries, and Hashbrowns and Garlic Toast in this little unit just like I did in the Cosori, and it has achieved equal results with equal speed. Good Job Bella.My replacement Cosori, if it ever arrives, is going to be relegated to the pantry, and we'll bring it out only if we need to. In the meantime, Bella gets the use and the counterspace. And at $50.00 you can't ask for much more.",

It\u2019s large enough, super easy to clean. I wish the print on the controls were a bit larger so my near-blind mom could use it for her beloved egg rolls, but it\u2019s fine for people that can see.",

It is on the small size but big enough for one or two people and looks great in the kitchen. I definitely recommend it!",
