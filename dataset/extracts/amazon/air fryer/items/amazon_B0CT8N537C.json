Good quality, has a nice touch screen, a clear window, and very easy to clean, Highly recommended!",

It has modern looking, built with new tech and easy to use. I messed with it for few mins and knew how the modes work. I use mostly the broil mode to make my veggie every day. It comes with menu\u2019s instruction which included 36 different types of food from appetizers, main courses and desserts. I really enjoyed baked chicken wings, and chicken thighs, beef rack, lamb rack\u2026from its recipe. I recommend when you air-fry tofu you should pour 1 teaspoon oil on the top of tofu make it not dried out, from instruction it said we void oil, but I did mine and it tasted great. The size of frying pan is enough for 4 people. It is not bulky, so it does not takes a lot of space from my kitchen. So far, I showed to my kids how to make cake and egg tarts from this air-fry, they did twice and ask for more\u2026I feel this is fun and safe when my kids learning to cook with this with out worrying they may get hurt when they use the stove.",

We can cook fries and nuggets from start to finish faster than we can pre-heat our big oven. The instructions are very helpful and it comes with a small cookbook full of ideas. The bin is easy to clean, rinse, and dry, making this really great for lunch prep. Overall the design and construction feels solid and premium. I'm a big fan, would recommend",
