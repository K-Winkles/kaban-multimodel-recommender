                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best appliance since the microwave!!!",
                "reviewText": "Been having this fryer for 2 weeks now and it has NOT rested yet. I LOVE IT & wonder how I've gone this long w/out one. Before I start bragging on this thing, I am by no way endorsed by Ninja or getting paid by them. I've owned a few Ninja products blenders and still have one that's over 10 years old. They make quality machines. This fryer is a life & time saver...especially if you're a lazy cook. I have been researching air fryers for the past few months and nothing comes close to the Ninja. The basket size isn't the large 5+ quart capacity like the bigger fryers, (Ninja is only 4qt), but this thing cooks so fast you won't miss the extra 1 qt. It comes w/ a crisper that works perfectly, a recipe book and a multi-layer rack. The first night I had it I made wings and I tell you that I will NEVER buy fried chicken again!!! Yes, they were that crispy and tasted much better. I bought the Louisiana fried chicken flour from Walmart, battered the wings, spritzed w/ a little olive oil and had fried chicken in 10 minutes. No greasy mess, no 3rd degree burns from hot oil, and your house doesn't smell like a chicken joint for 4 days afterward. Because the Ninja uses a ceramic coating on their fryers the clean up is very easy. Next, I made sweet potato fries! Had a bag of frozen ones in the freezer and popped those babies in for 10 min. They were crispier than McDonald's. I tried homemade fries but the procedure takes too long. You have to peel, slice, soak potatoes, dry them...I'm just ready to pop them in the fryer and eat! It has been nonstop air fryer cooking in this house! I hit youtube to get a few recipes and it's been on ever since. What I like best about this fryer is it has a dehydrator feature and how fast it cooks. Frozen chicken wings? No problem! Throw them in the fryer for 10 minutes and they're defrosted. I've cooked pizza, fries, wings, reheated food, fried zucchini, and tonight I baked a chocolate cake. Everything came out perfect! Next up is donuts! The only thing I don't like about this fryer is 30 seconds after it finishes cooking it shuts off. I know this is a safety feature but I always have more items to cook. In 2 weeks, I have used my microwave twice, and that was to reheat coffee. Before I forget, I did cinnamon rolls too! I used the canned Pillsbury ones and it normally takes 20 min in the oven. In the Ninja? 8 minutes and that's if you like them brown. I actually could have stopped it at 5 min and they would be perfect. My house smelled like a Cinnabon factory!\ud83d\ude1b I have used every feature on this fryer except the dehydrator but I'll be making beef jerky soon. Overall, I am VERY pleased! The best selling feature was the price & the size. The Ninja is much slimmer than some of the bulkier fryers and fits under my cabinet nicely. I'm also happy it only used 1500W unlike some of the larger fryers that burn 1800 which could kill your light bill. The outside of the fryer doesn't get hot so you won't have to worry about getting burned but do take caution when taking your food out. Is it loud? My exhaust fan on my stove is louder than the Ninja. The extension cord on it is long so you don't have to worry about being limited on where you can place it. I think I've covered everything? This thing is THE BOMB! If you're wondering what cookware you can use, just about anything you place in a microwave you can put in the Ninja. I went to the Dollar Tree and bought a few 7\" foil pans I use to reheat food & bake in. Also, grab you some silicone tongs while you're there so you don't scratch the surface of your fryer. This thing has been almost as good as a kid getting a new bike for Christmas. You will NOT be disappointed w/ this purchase. Happy & healthy cooking!",

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s taken me so long to jump on the air fryer band wagon but I\u2019m glad I finally did!!! This little gadget is perfect for my family! Toaster strudels, French fries, chicken wings, chicken nuggets, you name it and it comes out perfectly crunchy (without the wet soggy greasiness!) It\u2019s also small which is a bonus since our apartment has a tiny kitchen and clean up is a breeze! We made pizza rolls and cheese sticks and it got so messy but all it took was wiping it down with a paper towel and even the melted on cheese came off without soaking or scrubbing!!! I love it and highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I have no idea why I waited so long to get an air fryer. Since we have had this one, we have literally used it every day. We have had fun trying out different types of food. This air fryer does crisp items up- which I love. There are a number of features we haven\u2019t used yet, but I love the ease of setting the temperature and cook time. Also, it is easy to pause and flip the food. The fry basket is nonstick (not plastic) with a crisping metal plate that is removable. It is exceptionally easy to keep clean. We also ordered silicone baskets to use as needed which we like to use with messy things like cheese sticks. So far everything has been great. We love the ease of use and not having to preheat an oven and wait for a longer cook time. We have cooked broccoli, cauliflower, salmon, chicken wings, hash browns etc. in the fryer and everything has been excellent. We typically only have 3 people eating here at any one time, but over the holidays with 4 people we would postage to cook two batches of the main dish to have enough for everyone, that would be my only complaint. But that would still take less time than using the oven. We are all very please with this purchase. I highly recommend.",
