                "reviewText": "Need to preface this by saying that this toaster oven was much much larger than I had anticipated. If you have a small kitchen with limited counter space, do keep that in mind. Luckily, this takes up the function of 3 tools (air fryer +toaster + oven.) So proceed with caution but do keep that in mind prior to purchasing. Shipping took a while for the item to get to my home-it kept getting rescheduled by Amazon so I was close to cancelling the orderAs an actual appliance, I've only tried the toasting and the oven function-I haven't personally tried the air fryer function yet. It does a good job as both a toaster and as an oven though, especially if you just want to broil something really quickly. It gets really hot on the top, so do not keep anything on top of the toaster oven. Interestingly enough, the item includes instructions which were and some recipes to try. Overall, it isn't a bad item, though I feel that there are other multitasker appliances that take up less real estate on the counter out there. I appreciate that it can at least fulfill the role of 2 appliances fairly well (have yet to try the air fryer function) but it is so large and bulky and I have a tiny, tiny kitchen. Not the item's fault, so no stars deducted on that basis. Appearance wise, it looks simple and sleek and is easy to clean.",

                "reviewText": "We love using an air fryer for cooking and reheating food so we were eager to try out this multi-function oven.Our first meal in this oven was a bunch of chicken tenders in the air fryer. It was easy to set the temperature and the air fryer rack was roomy enough to fit all of our tenders in a single layer.PROS:(1) The oven was relatively quiet, even on the High fan speed.(2) The outside of the oven stayed cool so I didn\u2019t worry about burning myself on the metal outside.(3) The chicken was well-cooked inside, but (see my CON below) it didn\u2019t get that crispy.CONS:(1) the timer was a dial style that didn\u2019t have clear distinction of the minutes so it was sort of a guess as to exactly how much time you were setting the oven for. It could have been 11 mins or 14 mins, for example, you couldn\u2019t tell the difference with the dial countdown timer.(2) The food didn\u2019t get crispy like I was expecting. I don\u2019t know if that was the air fryer functioning not being great, or maybe the amount of time. It\u2019s hard to know without doing more tests with the oven and different foods.(3) The temperature dial was similar to the timer, you could not dial in an exact temperature, it was only an approximate temp because of the demarcations for different temps were too far apart.(4) There is no \u201coff\u201d button. When I tried to turn the timer to Zero it was extremely difficult to do. I ended up just unplugging the appliance instead.On our second meal with the air fryer we tried some buffalo chicken bites from Costco. I set the timer for a longer period so that they would be crispier than my first try with the tenders. I also used the \u201chigh\u201d setting on the fan this time.The results were not very good. Parts of the chicken bites were burned, yet the overall coating was not crunchy, instead it was sort of a soft mess. The chicken inside was cooked, but the exterior wasn\u2019t appetizing at all. (I finally put the soft chicken bites into our Ninja air fryer to get them crispy.)OVERALL: As an air fryer, I\u2019m not impressed with this appliance. The dials aren\u2019t exact enough for temp or time, and the food doesn\u2019t come out crispy like our other air fryer. We don\u2019t use a toaster or broiler much so I didn\u2019t get to try those functions in this machine. Maybe those functions work better than the air fryer.",

                "reviewText": "I think this oven is great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that for toasting things like bread, bagels, muffins, and other things that a small \"toaster oven\" works really well for, it takes a bit longer to heat up to get that done, due to the larger interior space. I have cooked a chicken in here and made chicken wings and french fries, and this oven does a great job \"air frying\" all of those things. I find this much more convenient to use than my full-size oven, as it heats faster and is easier to clean as well.",

                "reviewText": "I can't say enough about this oven. I have used it just like my in wall oven and everything bakes in half the time. The air fryer basket does chicken wings perfect. It is very easy to use. The settings are all designed for what you are using it for making it fool proof. Easy to clean. The trays slide in with ease. Sits perfect on countertop, not taking up too much room. We got rid of our toaster since this oven does that as well. So far I have not found any negatives to this oven. HIGHLY recommend!",
