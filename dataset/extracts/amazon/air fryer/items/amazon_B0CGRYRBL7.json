I would like a teflon stack tray though to have at least a double layer of items when cooking. Im not sure why thats not an option but I'll figure something else out. Just would've been nice to have. But the 7 qt doesn't take up any more space than my 3.5 qt NuWave Brio does.",

Finalmente cuando termina todo vuelve a pitar. Me encanta porque soy despistada y se me olvidaba darle la vuelta a la comida! Adem\u00e1s muy linda y pr\u00e1ctica, la cocina se ve ordenada y deja m\u00e1s espacio en la encimera.",
