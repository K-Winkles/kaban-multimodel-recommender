                "reviewText": "I bought this air fryer because it's \"programmable\" and goes by minutes instead of 5 minute timer. I love how easy it is to clean. It's a perfect size for me since I live alone. I didn't like turning on my oven to cook 2 little hash browns. The basket holds 2 hash browns side by side just perfectly. It takes 3 minutes to preheat instead of 10 minutes on my oven. I cook the hash browns for 13 minutes and they come out crispy and perfect. I cooked the hash browns for 18 minutes in my oven. So basically half the time to cook the hash browns instead of 30 minutes using my oven. So what it does is you plug it in. It does it's little swirly thing and then 400 degrees pops up. You turn the dial to the temp you need. You then click the temp/time button to get it to the minutes. You turn the dial to how many minutes you want it to cook for. I put 7 minutes and than just let it sit. It turns itself on after a few seconds of not turning the dial. After it beeps I flip the hash browns and start the process over but only put in 6 minutes on the 2nd side. It's fast and cooks in lower temps than your oven because the fan is blowing the hot air over and around your food. I unplug the fryer and let it sit while I eat my food. I than take out the basket and dump some dawn dish soap with hot water in the basket and let it soak to let the temp of the water cool a bit. I scrub it clean, rinse and let it drip dry on a rack in my sink. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.",

My food was burned and the fryer got so hot it began to melt the the plastic facing on the fryer itself as well as the adhesives holding things together! Went to pull the cooking basket out, the handle came off and you could see the seal around the rim of the basket was melting and warped. I will be returning and putting my money towards a better quality brand and product.",

I air fried some carrot strips and potato wedges and was very pleased with the results, so much easier and better than oven roasting. It\u2019s a perfect size for one or two people and is super easy to clean. I just tossed the veggies with a tiny bit of oil and seasoning and they turned out perfectly. It has a cute design and is small enough to store easily. Based on my experience so far, I would definitely recommend.",
