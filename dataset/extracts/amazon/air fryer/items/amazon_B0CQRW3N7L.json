                "reviewText": "The Home Warehouse Premium Carbon Steel Air Fryer Basket for Oven is perfectly sized for our Breville toaster oven. I prefer these air fryer baskets with the tray over the one that came with the oven to catch oil and drippings. We had been using a very similar basket that was a little smaller than this one; I'm very pleased with the size. I had to replace the old one because my husband thought he could clean it with oven cleaner and inadvertently took the coating off of it.This tray is coated carbon steel like my last one, so a word of advice about care: carbon steel does rust if you scratch off the coating (or burn it away with oven cleaner), so proper care of the tray is crucial for its longevity. Do not use harsh chemicals or metal utensils on it. Also, the bottom tray is on the light side, and it looks like it will warp with prolonged exposure to heat without the weight of the fryer basket to keep it lying flat. I do not recommend using the tray on its own as a baking sheet; it is meant for catching crumbs and oil only.",

                "reviewText": "I have an Anova Oven that has convection capabilities that basically make it an air-fryer. I love to reheat store-bought chicken wings in my oven, as they get even crispier without drying them out. Previously, I air-fried them on a flat pan, but I would get better air circulation with a basket style fryer tray.I spotted this fryer backset and ordered it due to it being carbon steel, high temp tolerant, and a good fit for my Anova Oven. I tried it out a few times and I love it!I know I would get better circulation with just setting the food in the basket, but don't like a lot of clean up so I tend to use a sheet of parchment paper. Thanks to the basket shape, setting food in the basket cradles the parchment paper perfectly. If some liquid pools at the bottom of the parchment paper, it doesn't run off into the oven thanks to the basket shape! Even though the parchment paper limits some air flow, it's way better than using a flat pan where the hot air can't wrap around the bottom of my food. If I need a good crisp on all sides (say, like frying a backet of fries) I'll skip the parchment paper.I love the attached tray as well, it catches anything that drips or falls. If I use parchment paper I typically skip the bottom tray, but it's a nice option for when I need to skip using the paper.Overall, it's a nice quality fryer basket that is a little more premium than a steel one. I haven't machine dish-washed it yet, but looking forward to that flexibility as my other racks/pans would just rust!",

                "reviewText": "To clarify, I don't own a stand alone air fryer, but my oven has an air frying function, so I am looking at this product from that perspective. At a $19.99 price point, I figured this would be fairly flimsy and mediocre quality. With that said, this product is expectedly flimsy but shockingly small. I don't know how big air fryers generally are, but I would expect them to come with their own baskets and trays, so this seems like something that would be intended for a different sort of product, such as an oven. It is about half the size of a standard baking sheet and won't hold more than enough food for 1-2 people, depending on what you are putting in it. It is beautiful but I don't know if it will stand up to many go-rounds in the dishwasher. It is deeper than a baking sheet and the basket sits high enough above the tray for good circulation. Overall, I guess it's worth trying if you're not looking for a long term product or needing more food than one person will eat at a time, but I would think $15 would be about the most I would pay for it in that case.",

Even if your range doesn't explicitly have an \"air fry\" button, if it has a convection mode, you have an air fryer built into your oven and this basket will allow you to achieve the same results as a dedicated air fryer.The secret to air frying is be able for more of your food to be subject to the air currents blowing around your oven, so the elevated basket permits this to happen. The companion pan sits underneath the basket to catch the drippings that might be generated during the air frying.Cleanup is easy due to the coating of the basket. We haven't tried putting it in the dishwasher yet, but it cleans up very nicely with soap and water in the sink.",

                "reviewText": "I have a GE Cafe gas range, and it has a built-in air fryer mode hidden in its menu. That's great, but you really want an air fryer basket like this one in order to take the most advantage of that feature. This is my second basket (in case you are wondering, you really should have two - one is not enough because there are so many fun things to air fry!)So anyway, this Home Warehouse Air Fryer basket is a standout for its decent quality and cool color. I like it alot and it does its job well. You may want to spray it with cooking spray so things don't stick to it. It's mostly not a problem, but due to the nature of the things you might air fry, there is always the possibility of something getting caught up in the mesh...a quick scrub will get it off, and a bonus is that this item is dishwasher safe, so you can always clean it up that way.Good item - make sure you pay attention to the dimensions in the seller's photos just to make sure it will fit your oven and that the sizing meets your expectations!",
