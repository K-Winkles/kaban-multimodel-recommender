                "reviewText": "The Accessories for Ninja Air Fryer, including the reusable sheets, liners, and rack, have enhanced my air frying experience by offering practical solutions for cooking and cleanup. The reusable sheets and liners make cleaning a breeze, providing a non-stick surface that prevents food residue from sticking to the air fryer basket. The additional rack increases the cooking capacity, allowing for more versatile meal preparation. These accessories have proven to be durable and efficient, simplifying the cooking process and making my Ninja Air Fryer even more versatile in the kitchen.",

You really have to scrub to get it all out. The mats, being flexible, are so much easier to clean.The other problem is that I didn't feel like enough air got underneath the food with some items and the grill rack will make a huge difference in the food I want to be crispy and not merely cooked.This came with a code for membership on their website,. so I signed up for it. Has lots of recipes and even product testing.",

We tried the rack with some frozen hash brown patties she loves to air fry and it took away the need to flip the patties. They were centrally heated and perfectly crisp on the outside! Yum! This was just one instance of many ideas we discussed. The mats may or may not be as useful, but time will tell.",
