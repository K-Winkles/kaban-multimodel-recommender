I like the square shape, and it's easy to use and french fries come out crispy. The tray that holds food up from the bottom of the drawer is a bit fiddly and doesn't slide in/out easily, especially when it's hot, but that's a small complaint. I didn't notice any odors (other than the food) when using. The tray and drawer wash easily.",

It feels solid and well-made, is so easy to use, and clean up is a snap. According to friends who own air fryers, it's a large size and holds more than most. I haven't had it long enough to try many things, but it crisps sweet potato fries to perfection. So far, I haven't found one negative; everything about this lovely thing is great, and I highly recommend it.",

I seriously thought the machine was about to explode because of how insanely loud it is under \"normal\" operating conditions. But it does go quiet all the time, because the fan breaks all the time. Within the first attempt of using it, I'm watching a box heat up with no air convection at all and didn't realize it was only cooking itself rather than the food. But after a while it's easy to know if the fan is working correctly, because you'll hear the sounds of a machine shop in your kitchen and half to bash the unit on the side to get the fan motor to start. Think of a really ancient piece of machinery and you'll understand this thing.",

It took 3 minutes of preheating before the cycle starts. Lots of time & temperature options but wish there was more information in the user's guide on when to use or not use the crisper tray.",
