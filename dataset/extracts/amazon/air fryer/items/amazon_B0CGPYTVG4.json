The 4-quart size is perfect for a family of three or four and doesn't take up too much countertop space. The stylish modern design and touchscreen functionality make it aesthetically pleasing, and it operates quietly. Additionally, it is very easy to clean.",

It is easy to clean. It makes the food taste better than when cooked in the traditional way. It uses less oils so it is healthy. I just used it to roast a whole chicken. It fit in the air fryer (I bought a small one about 2 pounds). It was tastier than any rotisserie chicken I have bought at the store. I used it to roast vegetables and they tasted like restaurant quality!I highly recommend this air fryer!",

Only downfall is, I think it may be a little too small for my usage (5qt may have been better) but that's on me. I am still keeping it because it works well for the little things and I really do like it.",

                "reviewText": "I did get the green one!! Picture was accurate in color. I had a wonderful Dash 2.6qt that I am giving to a friend, without concerns, as it was also really good. Only reason I gave it away is that I down-sized too much (had a 2019 counter-hogging 7qt!!!) - the 2.6 was fine for just me, except when I cook I would like leftovers, not just to make a kitchen mess for 1 meal!!!! So opted for the 4qt - which held 2 turkey thighs (2.25lbs) with space for air flow - came out great!! The Dash would have only been able to handle 1 thigh. And another comparison, it easily held 4 regular size frozen crab cakes, and for breakfast, took on 7 half slices of bacon - Dash took only half the qty. The Beelicious 4 qt is easy to operate, cleans easily, and the drawer smoothly slides in and out. Also, please note many of the newer fryers seem to be minimizing size: this 4qt fits perfectly under the special order cover I had made for the Dash. But the drawer is way bigger at 7.5\" x 7.5\". I am a very happy camper and highly recommend this air fryer if 4 qt is a good size for you!! I also bought it because it had a 4.9 star rating. Deservedly so.",
