                "reviewText": "I've been curious about air fryers for quite awhile, but didn't want to pay a lot just to find out I wouldn't use it much. Also because I already have limited space for storage with all the other gadgets. But after reading the reviews of this small unit I decided it was worth $35 or so to see if I would agree. I've had it about a week and so far have used it every day, all for frozen items that I usually bake or microwave. I must say that everything has turned out much better using the air fryer. Everything comes out perfectly crispy and in less time and temperature than using the oven. Fries, chicken strips and wings, onion rings, battered fish, shrimp and clams were all better this way. And I swear the wings were even juicier and surprisingly more flavorful. I definitely will not be going back to the previous methods.So far I've cooked everything at 375 for 10 to 15 minutes and the results are very consistent. If something is not quite done to your liking just put it back in for a few more minutes. It is extremely easy to clean. The exhaust air is about the same as a hair dryer. The compact size makes it easy to store. Regarding the smell, I took the rubber bumpers off the grate and there was absolutely no bad odor. The controls are so simple I don't see why other units even bother with digital controls. I used the timer on my phone to compare with the manual timer on the unit and it is close enough not to matter.",

I am so glad I bought it for myself for Christmas.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this as a gift for a friend. Unfortunately, the gift was not well received as my friend was very intimidated to learn a new way of cooking. She told me I needed to return it but I talked her into trying it and several days later, she called me to tell me she just made the most delicious chicken breast she's ever had. I'm guessing this means she overcame her fear of new things and is enjoying her new air fryer. Knowing how this friend reacts to change or new things, I was attracted to this little unit because it was very simple to operate and small enough for tiny apartment kitchens. I can't really give a true rating because it was purchased for a friend. I do like the simplicity of this unit and the fact that it all goes in the dishwasher. I would purchase this for myself if I didn't already have an air fryer.",

Made chicken wings and turned out as the best we have ever had, nice and crispy outside, tender and cooked through on the inside and all the fat collected underneath in the drip tray. Also did popcorn shrimp and Sweet potato rostii's from scratch with equally amazing results, made us wonder we didn't buy this sooner.",
