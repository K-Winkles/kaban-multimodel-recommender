                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019ve had this for about a week and made all kinds of things\u2014fresh and frozen chicken cutlets, veggies, fries, frozen Turkey burgers and even meatloaf. Makes everything nice and crispy. Simple to use. Some trial and error on cook times but it\u2019s easy to check food part way through cooking and get the hang of it.Def does a good job and is much quieter and runs cooler that I thought it might. You can hear the sound level in the video, it\u2019s not bad as all.It\u2019s very easy to clean, which was a big concern for me. The rack and basket are dishwasher safe but so far all I\u2019ve had to do is wipe with a soapy sponge and rinse. Nothing sticks to it either.It is small but I knew that. I don\u2019t have the space for much more. For one it\u2019s perfect and for two you can manage. For a family it would only work for small snacks and sides or else you\u2019d have to do many small batches. I fit three chicken thighs in it, or two breasts. The meatloaf was two half lb loaves, I had to shape them weird to make them fit without touching. It also fit 1 hash brown patty and two sausage patties at once. Fits a good size portion of roasted veggies and they cook fast so doing two batches isn\u2019t a big deal. Also made a pizza on mini naan bread that fit well. Probably could have fit 1 and a half naan if I had cut it up.Great price for this. It doesn\u2019t have digital dials but that doesn\u2019t matter to me and worth saving the money. I have a few other Bella appliances and they have all lasted long. Highly recommend.",

Livraison rapide, friteuse de bonne fabrication, description du produit correcte et comentaires nombreux pour une bonne connaissance d produit. Je n'ai utilis\u00e9 que 2 fois, mais cela s'av\u00e8re prometteur. Je n'ai essay\u00e9 que les frites congel\u00e9es, et je crois avoir trop rempli le contenant. Au second essai, j'ai rempli qu'\u00e0 moiti\u00e9 et arros\u00e9 de tr\u00e8s peu d'huile (1 c. environ). A demi cuisson j'ai retourn\u00e9 les frites pour les faire cuire uniform\u00e9ment et cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 parfait. C'Est moins graisseux que les frites dans l'huile et presque aussi bon. J'essaierai les beignes sans crainte, car je crois que ce mode de cuisson conviendra bien.Le prix est tr\u00e8s convenable, et la facilit\u00e9 d'utilisation aussi. Un bouton pour le temps et l'autre pour les degr\u00e9s. Simple. Je ne regrette pas cet achat.",
