                "reviewText": "I bought one of these for my mom for Christmas since I had a similar model and am really happy with it. She didn't get it out & start using it until January, but shortly after there was a problem with the cord. There was sparking and an electrical smell, so she immediately unplugged and stopped using it. She only just told me about it a few weeks ago (it's April now) so I contacted Chefman & let them know. We answered a few simple questions they had & sent them some pics. Their customer service was EXCELLENT! They were concerned, helpful, efficient, and sent out a replacement within days. I don't blame them entirely for the faulty unit, since I know sometimes things like this happen. I'm glad there was no fire for sure, but knowing the product since I have one too, I know it's a good brand. Now I'm even more convinced that the company is doing the right thing by their customers. I expressed my appreciation, and they didn't even ask me to write a review. I just had to put the word out. I would still highly recommend the product and next time I'm looking for a kitchen gadget, Chefman will be my first stop! Excellent customer service!",

When the box was opened the only thing wrong was the manufacturers box had a dent in the corner and the oven was still packed from the manufacturer and nothing seemed wrong with it.The air fryer is awesome, makes perfect toast, but when it comes to baking it's a nightmare.Every single thing I've tried to bake, either normal or convection, comes out burnt to a crisp. I follow the directions on the package, set the proper time and temp required, and get burnt food.I have tried setting the temp lower and time shorter, still burned food.I'm thinking there is something seriously wrong with it, so i stopped using it because I'm afraid it might burn down the house.My daughter contacted Chefman and requested help with the warranty Please let me know if you can help.Got for our anniversary 7-25 and started burning food right away. The first thing i cooked in the oven was pizza, it was so burned the chickens wouldn't eat it. Every pizza, crescent rolls, anything on bake burned to a crisp, even when i set the time and temp lower than directed. The other modes, toast, air fry are perfect. I stopped using it and went back to my old toaster oven which I've had for years, on 8-15. So used for almost a monthShe submitted the required information that they asked for and Chefman responded:After reviewing the documents sent over, your product is not covered under our warranty.We can only cover new items and your Amazon order confirmation says it was Used-Like New.Please reach out to Amazon and let them know you would like a refund or an exchange because we can not offer you any warranty services.Best,DebraCustomer Support RepresentativeMy return date ended on 7/27/22 and the oven I purchased doesn't work and now I am out the money I spent and my daughter does not have a toaster/air fryer oven in working condition.The company will not honor their warranty because I purchased it it from Amazon Warehouse in Used-Like New condition.I need a resolution",

                "reviewText": "Adquir\u00ed este producto por su espacio interior, el cual puede ser una limitante en freidoras de aire convencionales.Por fuera es de apariencia, y tama\u00f1o, similar a cualquier horno el\u00e9ctrico, la puerta frontal es de cristal con bisagra, abre hacia abajo.Cuenta con una rejilla para asador o dorador, una charola para recolectar grasa y moronas, una charola para asar y una canastilla para la funci\u00f3n de freidora de aire.Los controles son por perillas; tiene temporizador, selector de temperatura, selector de funci\u00f3n y modo tostador. Cuenta con un bot\u00f3n para encender la luz interior.Sus funciones de cocinado son: asador, asador por convecci\u00f3n, horneado, horneado por convecci\u00f3n, dorador, freidora de aire y tostador. Estas funciones permiten aprovechar el aparato m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de solo calentar o fre\u00edr productos congelados.Hasta ahora he cocinado pescado, hamburguesas de res, hamburguesas de pollo, alitas boneless, pechuga de pollo. Y en todos los casos los alimentos han quedado bien cocinados, jugosos y sin resecarse o quemarse. Pr\u00e1cticamente no necesitas aceite extra para cocinar y los alimentos tienen una cocci\u00f3n uniforme (recomiendo \"voltear\" las hamburguesas a la mitad del tiempo estimado de cocci\u00f3n).El aparato llega a la temperatura ideal m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido que un horno de gas; pasar de temperatura ambiente a 200 cent\u00edgrados le toma de 5 a 8 minutos. Conserva bien la temperatura con la puerta del aparato cerrada (nota: el equipo se apaga si se abre la puerta).El equipo tambi\u00e9n se calienta por fuera, pero sin llegar a quemar o causar molestia al tacto; sin embargo recomiendo que sea utilizado por personas aptas para el uso de equipos de cocina que generan altas temperaturas.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this oven/air fryer to replace a smaller little toaster oven I had, and I'm glad I did. This countertop oven not only fits, and looks great on the counter, but it is fantastic at roasting/baking/toasting, and that air fry!!! oh the chicken wings taste amazing!!! The unit is easy to use, easy to clean (the removable spill tray is very handy) and cooks/bakes like a traditional kitchen oven. To date I have baked home made bread in it, cookies, roasted chicken/beef, chicken wings, and toasted up to 6 pieces of bread for toast. The top and sides do get a little warm but as long as you heed the recommendations in the user manual of keeping it at least 2-4 inches away from the wall, or other appliances on your countertop, it's good to go. I highly recommend this oven if you are in the market for something this size.",

Simplifica las labores de cocina para un matrimonio ya solo.Espaciosa, acepta un recipiente de 31 cm con suficiente espacio lateral para manipularlo.Las temperaturas son bastante precisas, aunque solamente indica los grados en F, no en C\u00b0. Cocina bien, aunque no es clara la diferencia pr\u00e1ctica entre los modos \u201cbake\u201d (hornear), \u201cconvection bake\u201d (hornear por convecci\u00f3n) y \u201cAir Fry\u201d (fre\u00edr con aire), pues en cualquiera de ellos produce buenos resultados con diversos platillos. Posiblemente despu\u00e9s de un uso prolongado se puedan discernir diferencias sutiles. Sobre su durabilidad, es pronto para decir.",

If I could go back to the purchase sate I would not buy this again. I have contacted the manufacturer but no response yet.. and it seems everyone who bought around the same time is having the same problems. I wouldn't buy. Now I have to find another toaster oven airfryer.. such a waste of money.",
