This doesn't replace a seasoned toaster oven. But if your in a 500sqft S'Box apartment, with limited space, it can help you save space. It's an air fryer, toaster, toaster oven, rice maker, sous vide, and broiler all in one.As a side note: There's another combo cooker we'll call the Suvie. Which wants to charge you $500 plus a forced meal plan. This unit is far less expensive and has the same functionality. With the exception of being a refrigerator. Plus you get to choose your quality ingredients. Instead of getting mystery food in a bag. Since the Combi is new there's limited recipes out there. BUT the booklet does give you some clues on how to do things. You can go to a Suvie blog and kinda guess how to do them with the Combi. So expect a learning curve.",

                "reviewText": "I cook a lot of things in the oven. I would rather take 30 minutes to get something that tastes good with better texture than a couple minutes in the microwave. This means that on a nearly daily basis I\u2019m dealing with long preheat times, and a running fan after the oven is off to disperse the heat. I wanted something that could take the place of the oven for many meals, and also I wanted to dip my toes into the air fryer world.Happy to report that after using this for about a month, the Combi has done just that. I use it to bake things more often than I air fry, and I rarely use the combi bake/crisp features. But here are my thoughts on each.Baking is super nice because the preheat is around 2-3 minutes. Compare that to 10+ minutes for the oven. I do find that I need to decrease the temp about 25F from what is indicated on the recipe/box of the food. This is probably because of the small space. If I don\u2019t do that, the food has a tendency to get a bit overdone.Also, for food capacity while baking, it\u2019s pretty good. I am at home with myself and three kids, and I can often make all the food we need. Plus, if you ever get those Detroit style frozen pizzas, they fit perfectly in the back tray!Air frying is so fantastic! I love the crispiness. I love the taste. Best at home chicken wings I have ever made. And I love to use it for seafood, nuggets, etc.The combi bake and crisp continues to confuse me. I have used it, but I\u2019m always guessing at temperature and time. I did make some sausages recently on the combi crisp. The insides were juicy and tender while the skin had a very slight crisp to is. So that was cool. But when I tried veggies and chicken in the combi bake, the chicken was awesome, but the veggies were soggy. The combi features are going to need a while to get used to.Overall, this is a really great purchase, and had made meal time more efficient and sometimes tastier.",

                "reviewText": "I am a Ninja fan and have, or have had the majority of their products. I also tend to research their products before I buy them in an effort to avoid duplication of functionality. I did buy the Ninja Speedi thinking it would be nice to cook a couple of foods at one time. I did use the Speedi a couple of times. Once to steam and crisp a whole chicken and once to air fry French fries. Both came out very well. The problem I had with the Speedi was that cooking two foods required one to be below the other and there was no way to monitor each food being cooked, and there was too much trial and error.This Combi oven is basically an upgraded Speedi cooker that is much more versatile and, in my opinion, easier to use. It has the same functions and settings as the Speedi, but the ability to open a door on the front presents a whole new world of possibilities. I have used this cooker a few times since I got it and have not yet explored all the possibilities.So, what do I love about this cooker/oven.1) It opens from the front and has a window to view food as it cooks.2) The steam and crisp function should be called a steam and brown function. I have used this function to reheat meats, such as leftover roast, chicken, etc. that had been frozen and thawed. The steam keeps the meat moist, and an external thermometer keep it from being over cooked.3) It works great as an air fryer as did the Speedi.4) The steam and crisp works as well as my more expensive Anova oven to cook leftover meats and fish filets. For this, I use a Meater thermometer to monitor internal temperature.5) This oven is large enough to cook a 5 lb. chicken using the steam and crisp. For this purpose, an external thermometer should be used as the suggested times in the manual tend to overcook the chicken.6) Other than taking 7 minutes to build steam for the steam and crisp function, this oven does not require preheating.7) What I have cooked in this oven so far is done surprisingly faster than in my other ovens.8) The ability to reheat proteins, full meals, and casseroles without drying them out or changing the texture of the food is worth it's weight in gold.As with most new cooking appliances, there is a learning curve. Getting recipe ideas from the provided recipe book is a good way to get familiar with the capabilities of the Combi Oven. It should also be noted that recipes for the Speedi will work as well in this oven. Once you become familiar with this oven, it becomes easier to plan your own dual level meals.Overall, I very much like this cooker over the Speedi and would recommend it if it supplies the functions you need. I will update this review if my opinion changes, and hope this review was helpful for you.",
