                "reviewText": "This appliance is so easy to use, instructions are straight forward, and its easy to clean. Trays come clean with just soapy water and a sponge. If you have a postage stamp sized kitchen, its worth the counter space as it is compact in size but can still roast a whole chicken. I like that the beep isn't ear piercing when its done but still loud enough to be heard. I have a tiny kitchen with an apartment sized stove and this machine makes it much easier to stage food to cook so everything is served at the same temp using fewer pots, pans, and dishes. Used in tandem with an Instant Pot and an Instant Slow Cooker I'll likely not have to use the stove terribly often. So worth it.",

                "reviewText": "\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50I recently purchased the Instant Vortex Plus 6QT Air Fryer with Odor Erase Technology, and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations! This appliance is an absolute game-changer in my kitchen.Firstly, the 6-in-1 functionality is remarkable. It crisps, roasts, broils, dehydrates, bakes, and reheats with unparalleled ease. Whether I'm whipping up a batch of crispy fries, roasting vegetables to perfection, or dehydrating fruits for a healthy snack, this air fryer does it all flawlessly.The Odor Erase Technology is truly a godsend. No more lingering smells from frying or cooking - this feature ensures that my kitchen stays fresh and odor-free, even after cooking the most flavorful dishes.Another aspect that I love about this air fryer is the extensive collection of in-app recipes. With over 100 recipes to choose from, I never run out of inspiration for delicious meals and snacks. The recipes are easy to follow and yield mouthwatering results every time.Furthermore, the build quality of the Instant Vortex Plus is top-notch. It feels sturdy and well-made, assuring me of its durability and longevity.Overall, I can't recommend the Instant Vortex Plus 6QT Air Fryer enough. It's versatile, convenient, and produces restaurant-quality results. If you're looking to revolutionize your cooking experience, look no further than this fantastic appliance from the makers of Instant Pot.",

                "reviewText": "I read a lot of strange reviews about this air fryer. I decided to try it anyway. I've had it since the end of November (little over 3 months) and I am very happy with my purchase. I use the bake feature to reheat foods wrapped in aluminum foil, I've done pork roasts on the rotisserie, and I've used the air fryer for chicken breasts and steak. It's all turned out great! When I did the pork roast on the spit, I did feel I needed to cook it a bit longer wrapped up in the oven because I like meat that falls apart and I had a rub on it with sugar in the rub. Boneless skinless chicken breasts are nice and juicy and not dry when done in the air fryer. I do suggest getting a meat thermometer so you don't overcook it. I do homemade chicken nuggets in it and I even cooked some small meat loaves in it. It also does wonderful chicken wings from frozen.The trays are a decent size and you can fit a good bit of food in it. The drip tray in the bottom is nice so cleanup is pretty quick and easy. Some people complained about the door coming off. The door does easily remove by pulling up on it and wiggling it for cleaning. I have had the door misalign if I pull on it the wrong way but it easily slips right back into place. I'd rather have it removable so I can clean it. I did purchase some small silicone mats to lay on the door when I pull the trays out and turn the food so you don't get drips all over the door. I really like the light feature too so you can check your food without opening the door. I feel like it was well worth the money I spent on it and so far am happy with it's convenience and the speed that it cooks and reheats food. I did have a 3 quart round air fryer with a basket before this and I'm glad I upgraded. The other one (the basket one) was my first air fryer that I had about 3 years and this is my 2nd. Like I said, well worth the upgrade and much easier to clean!",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE (10/31): The door comment I mentioned below turned out to be a non-issue. I am satisfied that the door operates as it should. I just need to be mindful to use two hands to steady the oven when I close it. I do think the oven temp runs a little hot. But, I haven't got a oven thermostat yet, to test it. The smell from the first couple uses has disappeared. Otherwise, this oven is a very good value. And it looks and feels like it will hold up over time. Thx \ud83d\ude0a==========MY EARLIER COMMENTS:I received the oven last week, so this is an early review. As my subject line says, this is very nice oven and good value for the price ($120). But there's a couple of qualifiers to this early review that I am evaluating.First, the door - which feels solid and well made - doesn't always close correctly. It closes askew about 25-30% of the time when closing it with ONE hand. If I put my second hand on top of the oven and then close it, it lines up properly almost all the time. It seems to be something I have to be cognizant of when I use the oven. But it does leave me with a question on how well the mechanism will hold up over time. More TBD.Second, I not sure about the accuracy of its temperature control. I baked a frozen (half) pizza the other day - a good quality pizza at that. It got pretty crispy on the middle rack, after 9 minutes at 400\u00b0F (the oven max temp). The instructions said for 11-12 min at 425\u00b0. I am going to use a temp probe later, to check it's temperature accuracy.Lastly as others have commented, it gives off a chemically type smell during the first uses, which I could also taste in the food (I've used the oven 3 times). That said, I am going to \"season\" the oven by running it at max temp for 15 min (as someone else suggested). I suspect that will resolve the smell issue.TBC ... I will update this post in a couple weeks.",

                "reviewText": "I was going to return this because of a lot of cons i read on the reviews plus I don\u2019t have a lot of counter or storage space but I\u2019m sick of feeding my son and bf fried foods cooked in oil especially my son, who loves fried foods.My take on the cons I read1. Plastic smell- when I opened the air fryer for the first time, there\u2019s a wiff of plastic smell. Per the cleaning instructions, I wiped the inside with damp towel and dried it. I did this several times until I can no longer smell plastic when I stick my nose in it. I also washed the 2 trays and grease tray with warm water and diswashing soap and dried it with clean towel. I ran an empty cycle using Airfryer for 20min and almost immediately, there\u2019s a strong plastic smell filling my kitchen. I did 2 empty cycles for 20min each and I\u2019ve been smelling the vent behind it for plastic smell. During the 2nd cycle, the plastic smell wasn\u2019t as strong as the first cycle. I used it to cook food for the first time after few hours and the food did not smell or taste plastic.Bottomline for the plastic smell, I think cleaning the inside with damp towel and washing the trays really helped get rid of the smell in my opinion. I ran 2 empty cycles for 20min each and the plastic smell was gone.2. Touchscreen not sensitive enough- for this one, I don\u2019t really have a problem with it. Mine is working great. No need to touch it multiples times or even hard.3. Too loud- I\u2019m not sure if its because I always have Grey\u2019s Anatomy playing on my tv whenever I ran my airfryer but I don\u2019t think mine is as loud as some people mentioned.4. Beep too quite- Yes, the beep indeed is quite, but my solution to that is just setting my phone alarm.Food taste so much better and flavourful compared to conventional oven cooked foods.I have not tried the basket or the rotisserie but I\u2019m excited to cook lechon belly in it soon.Overall, I\u2019m very happy with this. This is my very first big appliance purchase since my bf and I started living at our own place. It will help me with dinner especially because I work the graveyard shift and I can cook my son all the fried food his little heart wants.",
