I used to have a name brand air fryer and it died some time ago and I wasn't sure I needed to replace it because I wasn't using it much. I finally decided to try this one because of it's size and price. It's a perfect size for feeding 1 or 2 people. I also like the color. It's a big bigger than I had imagined before it arrived but it fits fine on my counter. This air fryer is easy to use and even easier to clean up; the non-stick interior just wipes right up. I still don't use an air fryer a lot on my whole food plant-based diet but I'm glad I got it. I think the price was reasonable and if you are looking for an air fryer, I highly recommend this brand.",

                "reviewText": "I love my air fryer! As someone who lives alone and is a not a foodie, nor likes too cook, I had wanted an air fryer for awhile, but was worried it would fall by the wayside like my onepot and other cooking tools I bought thinking \u201cif I have this, I\u2019ll start cooking\u201d. Ha!The cycle was broken on this one. I love it to cook and reheat. It is easy to use and clean and I love that it takes way less time to cook things, part of why I hate cooking. In fact, it took me awhile to figure out chicken breasts b/c I kept overcooking it. Potatoes and veggies are so much quicker to make.Two main complaints, which aren\u2019t deal breakers. I wish it had more instructions on how long to cook things. There are settings etched in the cooker, but it\u2019s missing some basics. Also, It is kind of small. I am one person, so it works okay, but if you are cooking a lot, you may want it bigger. I try and leave space for the air to come through, but you can also overlap a little in things like veggies. You can also use with tinfoil. It works like an oven which I love in the summer because it keeps my kitchen from getting too hot since I don\u2019t have an a/c unit in my kitchen.I recommend it",

I LOVE the color makes me so happy looking at it on my counter it\u2019s so pretty lol. And cooks SOO WELL. I was worried I wasn\u2019t even going to use it that much but here I am using it daily and depending on it now for eating more real foods. I was eating stupid stuff before that didn\u2019t feel like real food, such as chips and stupid stuff. Now im able to actually cook warm meals. And it\u2019s piece of cake washing it just put the tray and the metal piece inside the dishwasher and done!. It was worth every penny",
