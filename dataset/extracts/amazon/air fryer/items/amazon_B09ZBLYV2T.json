They look amazing...and there is no doubt most of them look more appealing than this Ninja Black air fryer. Here's the deal tho...those beautiful glass door air fryers you see in the store are going to get dirty when you cook with them. The grease from the wings and every other thing you cook in it eventually stains the glass of those fancy looking air fryers. The black air fryers such as this one looks never gets stained or becomes an eye sore. As far as performance? I love this air fryer and it's absolutely the best air fryer I've ever had. I highly recommend....",
