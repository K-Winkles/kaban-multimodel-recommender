The bad news is, it has so many functions it will make your head spin just trying to learn how to use it. The best thing to do is start with one function, get the hang of it, and then try another. Otherwise, you will be so overwhelmed you won't remember how to turn it on. It comes with a starter cookbook which is a great way to learn how to use it. It also comes with a quick guide and a more comprehensive booklet for those who want to know every detail. It truly is easy to clean. I was amazed at how easy it is to clean the griddle. The griddle makes amazing grilled sandwiches, by the way. And French fries cooked in the air fryer are magnificent! One of the reasons I chose this oven is because the oven door opens down, instead of up, like some do. I don't have to worry about the door hitting my cabinets above when it is opened. Overall, a great oven and the best alternative to using a standard oven.",

                "reviewText": "So I bought this oven during the winter when the gas company decided to hike prices while raking in record profits. They do it every year, but this year, it was especially bad. After a $300 gas bill without even turning the heat on, I decided to buy this oven to replace my full-size gas oven (yay, solar panels). After buying this, my gas bill was more than cut in half, and now that prices have come back down, it's only $20 / month. This oven literally paid for itself.This was hands-down the best purchase of 2023 so far. Are the controls non-intuitive? Absolutely. I mess up and don't actually start the preheating or don't actually start the timer at least once a week despite having it for a few months now.Is it difficult to clean? Ehhh. I tried baking a cake I normally do in two layers in 3 smaller layers, and the cake pans overflowed all over the heating elements and bottom tray. It turned into birthday pudding. But the baked-on bits of char came right off once the oven had cooled down, and now there's not even the lingering smell of failure.Does it cook food so evenly and efficiently that you'll wonder how you ever cooked before you had it? YOU BET. Having such a small cavity means you use less energy overall compared to a much more voluminous gas oven. When you open the door to put food in, there's always a temperature drop, but a smaller oven reaches cooking temperature again more quickly because there is less air to heat up inside of it.In fact, when baking muffins and cakes, I've actually had to knock about 25F off the cooking temperature (thanks to the fan) and also turn off the top heating element to prevent premature caramelization and burning. OH, did I mention you can control the heating elements independently on a scale from 0 - 100%!?The only downside is that BECAUSE it's a smaller oven, I've had to either buy new pans or accept the fact that I can't use certain cooking methods. Most 12-cup muffin pans won't fit. It's got a maximum clearance of about 14 inches (~35.56 cm) from side to side and a depth (front to back) of about 10 inches (~25.4 cm). The muffin pans with the curved sides won't fit. You need a straight, rectangular one (which you can find right here on Amazon!) I can actually fit my cast iron skillet in there turned diagonally, though just barely, and there isn't enough vertical clearance for a Dutch oven of any size.The bottom line: this oven is quality, and you will not regret purchasing it. Whether you're baking, toasting, roasting, broiling, or just reheating food, everything comes out perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "Mostly I'm happy with the oven - however, my husband constantly fusses because he can't figure out how to keep it going - it is rather confusing, especially the way it turns off after preheating so you have to go and tell it then to cook, unless you turn off preheat. However the one thing he is really annoyed with and I can understand this - the bottom rack seems almost too small for the groves it rides on - you go to pull it out and one side falls down - that can be a big danger if you have a hot container of food on the rack and you pull it out and the stuff comes tumbling out!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had the oven now for several days and have used, air fry, bake, broil, toast, and used the probe in a grilled chicken breast today. So far everything has turned out excellent. Best chicken breast I\u2019ve ever prepared. It looked like it came off the bbq, the grill marks were perfection. This is my first experience with a toaster over and with an air fryer. I was a tad intimidated by the the controls, there are many. However, after the first two uses I was feeling confident. After the effortless and delicious grilled chicken today, I\u2019m 100% pleased with my purchase. I nearly purchase a straight up air fryer and then decided to spend a little more and go convection oven style. The absolute right decision.A couple of items to note:As others have indicated, the exterior of the oven does get hot when using the higher temperatures. Something to use extra caution about to ensure no burns. It does not transfer enough heat to impact my cupboards above or refrigerator next to it.Extra care should always be taken when pulling the various racks out to ensure no accidents with shelves tipping forward and potentially spilling hot items. I haven\u2019t had any issues, but I\u2019m very careful.",

                "reviewText": "We've owned many different brand air fryers in the past 3 years. Most last between 9 months and 1.5 years before they break down and we have to purchase a new one. We researched many different brands before deciding on the NuWave Bravo Xl air Fryer Toaster Oven. We have had it about a month and are very happy with it.It is a little intimidating when you first get it. There is so much functionality. The owners manual and the small cookbook that come with it are very well written and accurate.We spent some time experimenting with the different functions.It runs very, very quietly.",
