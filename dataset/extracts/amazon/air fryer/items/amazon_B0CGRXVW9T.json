For taking up not much counter space, it sure can take a large amount of food. I was looking at this oven style over the basket style fryers and I'm impressed with the versatility of this unit. There's so many setting that I'd be hard pressed to use them all. The controls felt a bit cumbersome at first but i gradually got used to the dial and press manner of operation. Saves time and energy over using a regular oven so i'm finding this becoming my go to appliance,I would have given this five stars except for a couple of things that aren't so great. First off, the popcorn basket is just plain dumb and takes up cupboard space; it's not something I would use (so out it went). The biggest disappointment was with the manual. The instructions are very vague and cook times unclear with no real recipes included. I started off making french fries and chicken nuggets (which cook really well) and moved on from there. You'll probably want to get an air fryer oven cookbook which is what I did.So it did take some learning but ultimately, I'm very pleased and so glad I went with this style of cooker.",

                "reviewText": "Overall this is a great little air fryer, however the instruction/user manual is very minimum. It says you can pop popcorn but doesn't explain how to attach the popcorn container to the oven. We did figure it out but it really takes exact finagling to make the thing fit in properly. Once you do, it does indeed pop popcorn wonderfully. I like the multi level function so you can air fry two items at once (like tater tots and chicken nuggets). My only complaint about that is that the shelves don't have a lip to it so if you move it too fast the items slide right off. Also, there's not a great way to grab the trays... It is a versatile contraption and we will get good use out of it, but it definitely could use a few minor improvements in these areas.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to replace a small air fryer I own. This looks similar. However, it does not function as well as the other one that I have owned for a couple of years now. This review is a comparison.-It is slower, a meal that usually take 7 minutes to cook took 12 minutes-It cooks better than the other air fryer, meaning the flavor is so much better-It is not touchscreen and figuring out how to use the dial button to set up type, timing, and temperature was a little bit cumbersome.-It has only three buttons, the dial to set temp, time, and type, a pause and go, finally a on and off button-Although it does not take much counter space, it can take a lot of food.-I have tried the rotisserie and it takes long as well, but cook the item to perfection-It comes with its own drip tray, rotisserie hook and cage, and three grillsOverall, it is not too too bad. I preferred my other one because it is touchscreens and cooks everything fast. This one albeit way slower, convection oven slower, cooks the food way better.I do like it and think it\u2019s a good air fryer system",
