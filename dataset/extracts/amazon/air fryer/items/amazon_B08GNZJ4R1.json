                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very Impressed With This Air Fryer",
                "reviewText": "Now that we have finally purchased an air fryer, I can't believe we waited so long! After what seemed like endless browsing on so many models, we decided on this crownful 7 quart airfryer, after it was offered during Amazon prime days at a good price. I was impressed by how sturdy the unit seemed as I pulled it out of the box and it fit perfectly on our counter (even though we will keep it underneath). The instruction book is an easy read and gives you all you need to know to get started. After washing the basked and insert tray, we turned on the unit at 400\u00b0 for 15 min as instructed to get rid of any coating on the basket and tray. The instructions suggested to cut lemons and put inside to minimize the smell but we didn't have any and the smell was minimal at best. Although we did have all the windows open so if it's winter you might want to purchase some lemons to be safe. We have since used the air fryer and do not notice a smell other than the food cooking. First we tried some breaded fish filets and used the directions on the box. DON'T DO THIS! We found the temp was too high plus the time was too long, and the fish was cooked rather quickly so it was pretty brown when the timer went off. Companies need to start adding air fryer directions to the cooking instructions on the box in addition to oven and microwave. We lowered the temp from 400 to 350 and cut the cooking time and they came out perfect! (See pic) Next we tried some boxed twice baked potatoes (See pic). We ignored the directions on the box and mimicked the same procedure as the fish. The results were perfect and saved quite a bit of time. This airfryer does a fantastic job cooking evenly and doesn't put out alot of heat externally, so it is perfect for indoor summertime cooking without heating up your kitchen. Later on that night we tried making some lamb burgers (See pic, and that is a mayo mustard dipping sauce next to the burgers). These came out juicy and delicious! Make sure to flip the burger halfway through the cooking time, and I pressed down on them to squeeze out some of the blood and grease that was building up in the middle. If you choose not to do this, I think your burgers will be more rare internally. If your fine with that then you probably do not need to push down at all. Some people choose not to do this thinking that it will dry out their burgers, but I can assure you that ours were plenty juicy, and we used lamb. The next day we tried frozen chicken wings (See pic) that came out wonderfully. (I did Google a recipe and procedure and they went from frozen to restaurant quality in a little over 20 min) Crispy outside and juicy inside. We really look forward to trying more food in this air fryer. The basket is roomy and can accommodate quite a bit of food, and it is extremely easy to clean. (I suggest you clean it or start soaking it when it cools for easier cleaning) We did hand wash the basket and tray and also tried it in the dishwasher. Both worked well, but we think we will choose to handwash everything in the future because it is so easy to do. There is also a recipe book that was included as well, with many choices to try. The touchscreen is easy to read and use (although it is a bit touchy when setting a temp or time. It responds very quickly to a light touch). It also has many preset functions for many items which is very convenient. Hopefully this product will last us for years to come.",

                "reviewText": "I received this product for free from Crownful as part of their product testing program. We had not owned an air fryer prior to receiving this one as we were unsure if it was worth the counter space when we already owned an oven. We had the option to pick between the 5 quart and 7 quart models and we chose the 7 quart model as we didn't want to get one that was too small. Upon using the product, we were happy at how much space the 7 quart model had in the cooking basket.The air fryer does a very good job cooking food quicker than an oven and without heating up the whole house the way that an oven does. The food is also crispier than in an oven and when cooking foods like hot dogs or brats, you get a nice exterior like when you cook them on a grill. We did have to play around with cook times a bit for things that didn't have instructions in the manual or on their packaging, but if you err on the side of caution and cook for less time than you think you need, it is easy to check as you go and you can always add more time if it need more. One important note is that the instructions often tell you to shake the basket halfway through cooking and this is a VERY IMPORTANT step. We cooked a batch of cheese balls and forgot to shake it and it was very apparent in that some of the cheese balls that were in the batch that we didn't shake were soggy. We made a second batch of cheese balls and remembered to shake them and we didn't have that issue then.The controls on the unit are touch screen and there are no other buttons on the unit which makes for an easy wipe down when the outside of the air fryer needs to be wiped down. The basket has a removable bottom plate that is permeated with holes to allow for grease to drain which is nice and makes cleaning out the basket easy. Between cooking batches, it is easy to wipe out the basket with a paper towel to clean up crumbs and when the basket gets dirty and needs a real cleaning, it is dishwasher safe which is a major plus. My only minor complaints are that the time and temperature controls are reversed from what an English speaking person would expect with the + on the left and the - on the right and the cord wrap on the back is a little awkward to use. Neither issue would keep me from recommending the unit to friends and family, but they are improvements I would like to see in future model iterations. Overall, we are very satisfied with this product.",

                "reviewText": "I just received it and have tried it out twice, it does make things crispy which is the reason i wanted it. There will be a period of adjustment because unfortunately packages of frozen foods do not have instructions on temperature settings and cooking times for Air Friers so trying to nail that down is touch and go. The instructions give a basic idea but I find it's still a little too cooked for my taste so trial and error. It is so easy to clean and easy to figure out how to use. Once I figure out the temp. and cooking times I know I am going to love it.",
