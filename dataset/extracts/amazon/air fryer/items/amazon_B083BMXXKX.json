I am absolutely shocked at what all this little oven can do. It is 100 times better than a microwave and a toaster put together. My children even love it! I have never tasted such flavor out of a simple chicken nugget that came out of the air fryer versus the oven. The air fryer is 100 times better. And the funny part of this was I was only looking for a replacement toaster because my kids broke my toaster. But somehow I ended up buying this and I am so glad I did! I highly recommend this little oven. There is plenty of space inside. You do not have to preheat the oven. It is fast as it works and very quiet. I was afraid it might be confusing to learn how to work the dials but I was wrong. It is very simple to operate. Again, I highly recommend this!",

                "reviewText": "I was pleased to find that this \"12-in-1 toaster oven combo\" fit nicely on our counter (see my photo) and that I could operate it safely and had no problem with overheating. Of course, I did make sure the oven had a couple of inches of clearance on either side and on top. I appreciate that, in a single appliance, I can do all the things I typically would in a toaster oven, plus broiling, convection roasting and hot-air frying. I do question how the manufacturer is counting the total of \"12\" but, yes, this oven serves a lot of purposes.I am giving this oven 4 out of 5 stars because it has its quirks and, as a customer, you'll want to know about them as you make your decision.First, this is a product for confident cooks who have some experience with using various forms of ovens. The box included a brief instruction booklet and a few pages of tips for cooking various foods. But that little booklet was not helpful in terms of cooking choices. Thank goodness, the machine is so easy to understand, right out of the box, that you don't need many instructions. There is a little chart that claims to explain how long to cook foods, and on what setting. But the first time I followed that chart to make sweet potato fries, they came out black. Ugh. On my second attempt, though, I followed my instincts as a home cook and also watched the potatoes as they began to brown. The result was excellent.I uploaded a photo of salmon fillets that I cooked with the convection function and my wife and I agreed this was some of the best, most juicy salmon we've had in recent memory. Normally, we broil or grill or even bake. The convection cooked it so quickly that the outside browned while the inside retained that wonderful juicy texture.So, one quirk is: You won't get a 1-2-3 training booklet. The booklet that comes with the oven does, indeed, have some important and helpful tips, but in our experience, the few pages about preparing food were useless.A second quirk is both a blessing and a potential problem: The interior is bigger than a typical toaster oven. That's wonderful because it gives you greater flexibility in what you can cook. In that salmon photo, I cooked 1.5 pounds of fillet strips easily. However, because the interior is so roomy, that means the basic metal pan that comes with the oven is 12.5 inches wide. I uploaded a photo of that with a ruler to indicate the width. The problem is: There's only one pan with the oven. And, even though I looked around Amazon and elsewhere online, the Ciarra company doesn't seem to sell additional \"accessories.\" What happens if you want to prepare more than one dish in the oven for a meal? You've got to move the food and clean the one pan. Plus, this oven certainly is going to outlast the life of the pan and basket. What happens if they reach a point where you can't completely clean them anymore to the standard you'd prefer?So, in terms of size, function and our experience cooking various foods in various ways\u2014this is a great countertop oven. But you'll need to know the basics of using such an oven. And there's an obvious advantage to the roomy interior capacity, but also a challenge because the pan is such an unusual size.",

                "reviewText": "This product was shipped quickly with all packaging in tact. Removal from packaging was simple. I love this toaster oven/ air fryer. It takes up the usual amount of space on your counter as any other. It came with one rack, one tray and an air fryer basket.I love there is an option for bake and an option for convection. This toaster oven baked chocolate chip cookies to perfection. I was stunned. The baked cornbread browned so nicely. Both were baked on the convection setting.I reheated pizza on the air fryer setting at 350 degrees and it only took 2 minutes. It was hot, cheese melted and the end crust was nice and crispy.I've baked a cobbler as well and it turned out great.An added bonus, when the oven is working there is an interior light that stays on and allows you to see inside. All in all I have to say this is the best one I've owned yet and I've owned alot of them.",

                "reviewText": "We wanted this product as an air fryer, but found that we are using it for many other things. It heats up fast, and is more economical than using a traditional oven and allows for quicker cooking. Since it has multiple functions, we can reheat food, use in place of a toaster oven, use it as an air fryer, use it as a conventional oven and even use it as a convection oven. It creates less heat in the kitchen and takes up a lot less room.",

                "reviewText": "I read reviews on countertop ovens until I was cross eyed and this was the first one that sounded acceptable. Well, I've only had it a couple days and I've made toast, air fried hamburgers and baked homemade crescent rolls. At this point I am very happy. It is so easy to operate, The internal cavity space is wonderful and I really appreciate the light, it's a smaller footprint on my counter than my previous (name brand) oven and there is still plenty of room between the top of the oven and my cabinets. I'm so pleased that I can now bake a large loaf of bread without using the big oven. The shelf slots are excellent, making the baking pan and shelf a perfect fit and easy slide. I hope it last a long time. At this point I would recommend it to anyone.",
