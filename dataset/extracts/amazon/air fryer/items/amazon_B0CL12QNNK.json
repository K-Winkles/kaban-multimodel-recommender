                "reviewText": "What I like:- Very large capacity--12 quarts, 6 per basket. I had a 2-quart unit, so this is a giant size upgrade. No crowding my tiny old basket with too many tater tots anymore!- Functions essentially as two independent air fryers. You can cook your protein in one basket while simultaneously cooking your veggies in the other one. You can make an entire meal that will be ready at the same time. Amazing.- Reasonably easy to operate. I say \"reasonably\" because I'm coming from a simple air fryer that has one knob for temp and one for time--it doesn't get much simpler than that.What I don't like:- It doesn't come with the nice racks that you can set inside each compartment to have double layers for even more capacity or, more importantly, even better air circulation around your food. The very similar 10-quart version you can get at Sam's includes the racks. If you buy the racks from Ninja, you'll pay over $50 for two, including shipping. Considering how expensive this 12-quart air fryer is, and how lightweight and simple the racks are, they should have been included as standard equipment, in my opinion.- Takes a a LOT of space on your kitchen counter. I'm talking toaster oven/countertop microwave level space. And, being that large, it's tough for me to store in my kitchen cabinets. It'll fit in my pantry, though.Overall, this is a great air fryer, especially for families and larger groups of people. It's easy to use, cleans up easily, and works great.RECOMMENDED.",

I can't believe how easy and efficient the NInja air fryer is. I really like using mine to make fried foods that are now being air fried like chicken wings and other items I would typically cook in my large conventional oven. I like the fact it fits on my kitchen counter and works in half the time of the oven, I even think the food tastes better.",

We got this ninja air fryer and we are both able to cook a meal at the same time or even one large meal. It is very nice high-quality, and does a good job of thoroughly cooking the food.",

                "reviewText": "So this is a huge air fryer, as it has two bins and they didn\u2019t make it so that it was like a single air fryer that they split in half no no this is air fryer that has two normal size bins. I was interested in this because with the two bins I can air fry and both, I can air fry in one and roast in the other, or I can just use one bin and leave the other one alone and off. So I really liked the convenience and the flexibility that this air fryer brought to the table.It works as expected it comes and it comes with the two inserts that you placed the food on top. I have never needed to have any additional inserts but they do sell them separately if you need more. I find that air fryers really are a lifesaver for me because I don\u2019t need to fry food on my stove top anymore. I do think that because it\u2019s so big you need to make sure that you have space for it on your countertop when you use it. I have to clear things off to be able to use this, but I live in a small apartment so that\u2019s normal for me.It\u2019s easy to clean, just like a normal air fryer, and I do store this on top of my refrigerator where my old air fryer used to sit. That seems to be the best place for me to store the air fryer at this point in time. It\u2019s very easy to use as the buttons and the controls are simple and it\u2019s not rocket science I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine program in exchange for an honest review. I am responsible for all federal and state income tax on products that I receive from Amazon Vine. My participation in Amazon Vine is not dependent on how I rate a product, but that I give honest reviews, irregardless of the rating I give the product",

                "reviewText": "This is a really nice air fryer. Our old one (the largest size of Power XL) stopped working and needed replacing. When we got it there weren't so many options so, since I liked my other Ninja appliances, I decided to try this one out. It is super nice to look at but HUGE. It takes up quite a bit of space on the counter so be prepared for that. It has two sides with long skinny rectangular baskets. You can use them concurrently or just use one side which is good if you are making two different items or want to make larger quantities of something. The buttons are clearly labeled and it's easy to know what you need to do to use it. It did cook things a little more efficiently than my old one so I'll need to adjust cook times a bit (the old one usually needed the higher time when a range was given) but that just means food is ready sooner!If you have a large family, do a lot of entertaining, or have an excessive amount of counter space, this is a good air fryer for you. If you're just looking for an air fryer to make food for one or two people, this would probably be excessive. It would also be too much if you have a small kitchen. It also wouldn't work if you were wanting to make larger things in the air fryer (some can air fry a small chicken for example) as each basket is 5 qt and shaped in a way that could limit larger items. If you want to air fry larger things I would suggest a single basket air fryer. As long as you know what you're getting, this is a great option.",
