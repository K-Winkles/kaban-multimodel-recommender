I had been holding off getting an air fryer because we have a really small kitchen with no counter space or storage space. I saw this one come up in my search as a compact air fryer. I read the reviews and purchased the 3 QT. It fits nicely in a small space and looks nice. Better yet, it has worked wonderfully for us. I think one or multiple people in my family have used it every single day since we got it. It cooks food quickly and I highly recommend this product.",

So far I've cooked eggs on two settings, and the bake setting was better than the air fryer setting. I've also baked some muffins, they came out with a slightly burned top on the bake setting, but I'll try other settings until I get it right. The little muffin cups that were included have useful little handles. It is easy to use, the settings are easy to figure out. Ignore the bad reviews that say the settings are confusing, those people refuse to read or learn. The button icons are pretty easy to guess, but I went through the instructions anyway. Easy and useful kitchen appliance. Small size makes it great to take to work!",

I\u2019ve cooked my chicken wings in there several times and not once have they ever been crispy. I got rid of my other Air fryer to buy this one because the wattage was higher and it takes just as long to cook. I feel like I wasted my money.",
