Broiled a rib eye steak as soon as I got it, came out great. I also use it to finish off microwaved baked potatoes. 7 minutes in the microwave 5 minutes in toaster oven soft inside crispy skins on the out side. Frozen pizza comes out hot and bubbly in just a few minutes. Hardly use my regular oven any more. Has many built in cooking cycles that make cooking a quick meal easy. Trust you'll love this one. Hardly a day goes by that I don't use it. Oh, easy to clean any drips with a pull out tray that I rinse off or pop in the dishwasher easy peasy. A bit pricy but well worth it in my opinion.",

That fixes the main thing that annoyed me, and after living with it for a month, the dang thing does an incredible job of cooking. BTW, get the cutting board for the top - it's so worth it to have a cool top surface. So I consider it now a five star device which I love *almost* as much as I expected to. Integration with home assistant so I can blink lights and stuff when it needs attention would put it at six stars out of five. \ud83d\ude02No Home Assistant integration yet, but maybe someday.Original review follows, because I'm not editing history; I said what I said at the time, even if it was borderline wrong. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f---The idea of a smart oven is awesome, as is the guided cooking. ChefStep almost got it right, then Breville bought them and I guess everything stopped?This thing is really nicely made and works well. But there are two things which are annoying me enough that I really wish I had preserved the box.1: the app is absurdly limited, and even though they obviously have an API so Alexa works, the API isn't documented anywhere. There's supposedly a Google voice integration, but the link on their setup page is broken, so no Hey Google for you. No Home Assistant integration either, despite supposedly having a developer on staff who said it was coming soon a year ago.2 - you can't just preheat the oven. Alexa can preheat the oven, ans the app can preheat the oven *in a recipe*, but there's no way to just use the front panel or the app to preheat to 350. You can say 350 for 15 minutes, but as soon as the oven is preheated, the timer starts. So they expect you two stand in front of the oven with your food all ready to throw in at the moment the preheating is done. The timer pauses when you open the door, but it's a small oven so you're losing heat now. You can can reset the timer, but as you're increasing the time, it's still counting down. So you turn to 15:00, and then it goes to 14:59, so you rotate again to get to 15 then 16 minutes. Every second, the number on the display is goes down by one, so it's a really aggravating experience. And of course there's no timer for how long it'll take to preheat. Sure, there's a thermometer in there which knows the current temperature and could calculate based on the time it's taking to increase the temperature how many more time intervals it'll take to reach the temperature, but obviously basic machine learning isn't a popular enough buzzword at Breville.l to apply it in a smart oven.All those buttons and all that intelligence, and no friggin way to just separately preheat or start the timer like literally every other oven which has ever been made. Otherwise, this thing is great. But holy cow, how did they overlook the most basic feature?Also, I'm a software engineer, not some old technology-averse curmudgeon who doesn't understand modern humanity. \ud83d\ude02",

                "reviewText": "I have a makeshift kitchen in a basement \u201capartment.\u201d This toaster oven air fryer does more than replace a full sized oven. They have marked in the glass the rack positions to make it idiot proof. For me having the app with detailed instructions and videos was invaluable. I wish there were more meal recipes vs baking and more low carb but I\u2019m sure the recipes will keep growing. The auto pilot feature is ridiculous. My steak was PERFECT! Veggies were perfect. I hate to cook and now I\u2019m actually kind of having fun just to see what all it can do.Living in a basement I was worried about ventilation. I have an air purifier that jumps about 20 points when my roommate uses the oven upstairs - or more. It\u2019s rare the Breville affects it all and it\u2019s a few feet away. It doesn\u2019t heat up the room either. My tv heats up the room more!It\u2019s not loud. I love the light comes on the last few seconds to warn you it\u2019s about time to check things out. Auto pilot is amazing. When I cook on my own I see if they have done some similar to see like rack position etc. It\u2019s been easy to use and everything has cooked perfectly from actual toast to baking to air frying. I don\u2019t have a lot of money so this was a MAJOR sacrifice for me but absolutely worth it. Love it",

                "reviewText": "It's not cheap, especially if you want the black stainless steel flavor which is only available in their most expensive oven. Even on sale for $439, it's pricey. However, our previous Breville lasted at least 10 years so I'm hoping this one will be of the same quality. Our previous Breville didn't have air-fryer capability, and we're finding that to be pretty useful as well. It's big (and bigger than our previous one), so make sure you have the room for it. I had bought the Breville cutting board to sit on top of our previous one, and it fits on this one as well.",

                "reviewText": "This oven is truly large, so be sure to measure your space first and consider that it is recommended by the manufacturer that you have space on the sides and back for air circulation and heat dissipation.The instructions are easy to follow and provide plenty of options. My favorite setting is Proof. I really did not think that this function would work well because proofing can be tricky, but it has been perfect every time during my weekly bread baking operation. The air fry setting may not work as well as a single use air fryer, but it works decently and all the other functions make it a worthwhile purchase for our household. The outside gets HOT during some operations. The removable crumb tray is fantastic. The included pans all work well. Cleaning after preparing an item like chicken wings can be difficult, but that was expected. We love this oven!",
