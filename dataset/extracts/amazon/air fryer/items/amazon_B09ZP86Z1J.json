If there's any black bits, it will smoke, but from day 1 this has given me great results and no smoke at all. I've used other air fryers that smoked the first time I used them.

What's not terribly obvious is how it works, or what the limitations are.You can't use both the air fryer and griddle simultaneously, because there is only one heating element which is responsible for both functions. Arranged as it is in the main product photo, it works as an air fryer. In order to use it as a griddle/\"frying pan\", you have to lift the top part of the air fryer off, turn it upside-down, and place the griddle surface on top. It's unusual, but the fact that it splits apart like this actually makes it easier to store.One unique feature of this air fryer is that it has a glass basket. I've never seen one like this before, and it's kind of cool being able to actually see how your food is doing without having to open it up. The basket is very heavy, however, so this might not be a good choice for people who have grip strength issues or difficulty lifting heavy items. It is, however, dishwasher-safe, so cleanup is a breeze.The main body of the device seems kind of cheaply made. The body is constructed of fairly thin metal, and bends very easily. One of the side handles (necessary for lifting the thing up and flipping it over to change configurations between grill and fryer) on mine came halfway loose, and it it won't completely seat back into its hole because the metal body is just slightly bent enough that the plastic tab on the handle can't find purchase. There was also something rattling around loose inside the main unit when I took it out of the box. The rattle has stopped -- I guess it found a place to get stuck with all of the turning over to change configurations -- but it still makes me uneasy.The first time I used this air fryer, I used it for frying frozen popcorn shrimp. I used the built-in \"seafood\" mode, and they came out perfect. I haven't used the griddle/\"frying pan\" yet, but mostly because it has a fatal flaw: there is nowhere for grease to go. Most griddles include some sort of path to a grease catcher that can be easily emptied, but this does not. I'm not sure what they expect you to do if what your cooking produces enough grease to collect on the griddle.The good: Air fryer performs well, split design makes storage easier, glass basket makes it possible to watch your food cook, basket is dishwasher-safeThe bad: cheap construction, glass basket is HEAVY compared to that of most air fryers, griddle has no grease catcherThing to know: can't use it as both a \"frying pan\" and air fryer at the same time",
