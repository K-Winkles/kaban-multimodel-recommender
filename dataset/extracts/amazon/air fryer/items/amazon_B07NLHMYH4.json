I love that it has an inside light, which most do not. It is easy to keep an eye on the food I am cooking, I also love that it remembers my settings\u2026for example the desired darkness that I want my toast. The controls are very easy to use which I was looking for due to some knobs on the other brands being too difficult to turn. I\u2019ve had it over 2 months and use it every day. I was a little hesitant to go with this brand instead of a more traditional toaster oven brand, but I have been very happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "I use this oven as my primary oven. Not perfect for Christmas Cookie Production, but the rest of the year it works for one person. My only complaint is that the racks fall forward when pulling them out - which has you pan or dish sliding towards you and hot! It is pretty easy to clean. It is not built for rotating large items. A Cornish Game Hen is too big! It makes the perfect gift for the graduate moving out and into their own place for the first time. The top gets hot, so don't use the oven top for storage of anything meltable.",

                "reviewText": "Compared to similar in size Breville 670: on the good side, this one would make frozen waffles quite decent on bagel setting. Also, I like steel heaters that are more reliable than quartz when are dripped over, and I do like the absence of \"smart chip\" that does something without explanations. Emeril algorithm is much simpler, well explained in the manual, and therefore the result is predictable. However, the Breville oven looks more expensive (which it is). I was not too successful making french fries on air-fry setting, but that could be just me. Baking is fine.What I do not like about Emeril:- the LCD display loses contrast if placed at your eye level or higher (Breville's LCD is as bad. They say more expensive Breville models have much better displays, but alas they are much bigger, and I wanted a mini oven, not a major appliance).- the LCD display is too busy, and functions are hard to read- the main control knob is the smallest one - an idiotic design choice, if you ask me. When you choose the function, it rotates too easy, and you have to be careful to select the right one. Two large knobs are for secondary settings, which is counterintuitive, so Breville wins this round.- the buttons are marked not very clearly- the beep is not overly loud, but could wake up someone else, and not sure if it can be turned off.So, overall, the oven seems worth its money, and I do not regret the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I read most reviews and can address a few issues. My spouse and I are also older and experienced cooks. First, cover your drip pan with foil before you cook anything. The burning and warping issues will disappear. Also cover your \"pizza\" pan with foil. These pans are not high quality and will be ruined quickly if you don't add a layer of protection. The airfryer function is just okay. I have used it twice but prefer my one function air fryer. For baking, we reduce the heat by 10 degrees and check it way before stated cook times. The baking feature tends to overcook. We did a 4 lbs. Rotisserie chicken tonight. We have a weber charcoal/wood grill with a Rotisserie, and we had the best chicken ever with this oven. You must tie it up with kitchen string though and really balance the chicken when skewering. Test it by skewering and turning it in your hands to test the balance before placing it in the oven. I included a picture to help with the visuals. Fall off the bone good but we cut the cooking time to 50 minutes. Also, keep plenty of space around your oven. People aren't kidding about the heat it puts out and I accidentally burned my forearm on the outside top of the oven when I reached over to unplug it.Update! We successfully cooked a 6 pound chicken. It was succulent and amazing. I would NOT do anything bigger than that.",

My one serious complaint with this item is the price. I paid $ 338 or so Canadian. This same unit was for sale and in stock at Wal-Mart on the same day for $ 249.00 Canadian. The larger XL version could be purchased from W/M for less than I paid for the unit in question. I guess I expected Amazon to be more competitive than it was in this case. I felt that if I unpacked the Wal-Mart unit ( not easy by the way ) and it proved defective/damaged, I would likely have had a real problem with a return to them given the high dollar amount. The unit itself is as advertised, no problem with it, just this nagging feeling that I may have \"given away\" nearly a hundred dollars.",
