I Just moved into my first place and I chose this one because it matched with what I was going for in my kitchen and it wasn\u2019t too expensive but the more I use it the more I realize it\u2019s okay. The size is a little small but perfect for me since I\u2019m only one person. You can\u2019t change the temperature so you kinda just have to roll with whatever temp it\u2019s on which I really don\u2019t like. It is very very quiet which I do like. Not sure if I\u2019d purchase it again but it would be good for maybe someone in college or if you only use your airfryer for simple meals",
