I bought the 3.7 qtBecause I\u2019m just one person however if I had a guest or two for dinner or snacks it is plenty big enough. I just got it today and of course had to use it so I will follow up later on after I\u2019ve used it for more than one mealI used it tonight for a breaded pork chop and roasted broccoli ( made together ). Listen, this is the best invention since the mouse trap !! My pork chop was browned and crisp and juicy inside. The broccoli was slightly roasted brown on the tips and both were absolutely delish. I never knew the variety of foods and meals you can fix in an air fryer !! I\u2019m a baby boomer and when I first saw these advertised I thought just another new fangled gadget. How can it fry with air and nearly no oil ?? I\u2019m here to testify folks !! I spent the afternoon reading the cook book that comes with it and I\u2019m blown away by the meals and items you can cook in this. Nearly anything you can fry or cook in your oven or stove top ! At first when I saw them on TV I thought so what! Why not just use my stove and oven! I\u2019m here to tell you whyFirst, of course, is the health issue, less fatsBut, other than that is your time. Dinner is cooked in half the time. Also, it\u2019s cleaner. No spattered grease on your stove or yourself which makes it safer. Your meats, I will testify to my pork chop, are not dried out as sometimes in an oven or frying pan. Since food cooks faster, there must be vitamins that are preserved and flavor is preservedMy chop was delishishly browned and crispy on the outside and juicy with a great flavor on the inside. Can\u2019t wait to make French toast in the morning and buttermilk biscuits and I crave fried chicken and roast chickenYes, this fryer is big enough for a whole small chicken and there are recipes for all this in the booklet that comes with the air fryer. Like I said. I can\u2019t give a review on the durability yet and I just cooked one meal but I will follow up in a few weeks. I followed all instructions to wash the pot and basket before use and to run it for 5 minutes at 350 to rid any odor ( left from manufacturer) and it worked perfectly. No smells and operated easily and quietly. I\u2019m very impressed!",

The fryer was very well packed and there was nothing to do but put it on the counter and wash the basket parts and read the directions. I decided since it was my first use to make something I wouldn't care about much if I screwed up; so I cut up some potatoes added salt, skipped the oil entirely and went for it. Came out beautifully! I didn't use any foil or parchment and the clean up was 3 minutes. I work a long day and when I get home, the last thing I want to do is deal with pots and pans, cleaning a stove and standing in the kitchen to cook a meal. This is GREAT! I put the potatoes in, turned it on and went about my other drudgery, only returning after 10 minutes to shake the basket and then 10 minutes later when they fries were done. I had a leftover chicken cutlet (cooked the day before, the old fashioned way) and tossed that in for 5 minutes to crispy it up and I had a great meal! The 3.7 was larger than I expected. I estimate I can comfortably fit 3 chicken legs and thighs or 2-3 nice sized pieces of fish. Can't wait to go shopping today after work as I plan to try out a few of the recipes in the cook book GoWise provided. All the recipes look super easy, require very few ingredients and look yummy. My next is going to be the apple chips for snacks at work and I'm going to try a few other recipes over the weekend. I'll update as I try new things.Update: So now after a few weeks I can say this is the best thing I have ever purchased, I have made several different chicken dishes, steaks, many different vegetables, including cauliflower, asparagus, carrots and zucchini fries. Made pita chips a few times, apple chips and mini pizzas. I am an air-frying maniac. Everything came out really crispy and delicious. The only thing I used oil on was the pita chips and asparagus, and even then it was a light spray of olive oil. Today alone I made spicy chicken cutlets with panko, brussel sprouts with garlic, 2 bags of pita chips with onion and garlic powder, and roasted carrots. Going to make roasted baby eggplant later and crushed them into tomatoes, cilantro and jalapeno for the pita chips. All came out really nicely and I have lunch for work for the next few days! I am eating healthier, saving money and enjoying the creative process. Thinking of getting another so I won't have to work in so many batches. We'll see. One other thing: I bought the parchment paper. Not necessary for anything I have made so far. Don't think it's necessary.At 2 months now of almost daily use. Still my best friend. Have had no adverse situations. I actually dropped the basket on a very hard floor expecting it to be dented...but nope...was still fine!",

                "reviewText": "Returned a 5qt other brand then found this 3.7qt, ideal for two. The size *seems* large until it finds its place. Really @12\" wide, not the 8.25\" pan diameter. So far, eggplant parmesan, buffalo wings, breaded shrimp, breaded bone/skinless chicken thighs, all super successes on first tries, and one unsuccessful attempt at potato chips. Super easy to clean; soak, wipe with sponge, rinse, dry with soft towel. Quite a few have reported problems with coated cooking surfaces chipping or flaking, but reason should suggest using non-metal utensils. On general principles, bought a roll of parchment (our grocery didn't stock round sheets) and, using a medium plate, marked numerous round sheets which I would cut and punch w/hand hole punch as needed. Operation is *REALLY SIMPLE* and uncomplicated, even for me, and cooking times seem less than traditional frying. A really nice, 50-item accompanying cookbook has some beautiful and interesting ideas! I'm beginning to feel really comfortable with fat-free cooking! The natural flavors are retained, and the crisp coatings are a delight. The outer surface does not get hot, barely warm, except at the back where a @2.5\"x2.5\" vent exhausts heated air. Only by holding your hand 2\" away for secs could you get burned. No heat seems to emanate from the bottom, although I do place a cutting mat underneath it. Would seem to be a *REALLY ECONOMICAL* appliance as it can cook entrees for 4, has a heating element substantially smaller than an electric oven, and a lot smaller than a convection toaster oven. Would I buy this neat air fryer again ??? In a New York minute !!! Really looking forward to some creative cooking!",

I use this a lot more than I thought I would. The 2 bone prime rib roast turned out a perfect medium rare restaurant quality meal. Chicken, baby back ribs and a perfect porterhouse steak has me using this for most of my cooking needs.UPDATE:After 3 years of use I finally tried my first air fried hot dog. Why did it take me this long ? It was delicious ! I warmed up the bun for 2 minutes and did the standard 5 minute warm function button for the weiner. Best hotdog I have ever eaten. It still is holding up like new. I use it 5 + times a week. It has never let me down. I highly endorse this item.",
