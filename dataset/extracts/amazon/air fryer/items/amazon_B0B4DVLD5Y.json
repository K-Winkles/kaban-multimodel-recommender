Insert the tip: try to get just a small portion of the lower base of the tip through the hole.2. Use your thumb to gently apply some pressure to the back of the bumper.3. Use your finger nail to gently tug on the edge of the small piece of protruding silicone located at the very base of the tip.Note: I wouldn't recommend using anything made out of metal to assist pulling the silicone through the hole.I'm so happy that Amazon carries this replacement part. The original bumpers didn't even last a year!",
