                "reviewText": "This is a really nice, basic, entry level air fryer and is large enough to make food for 1-2 people, though definitely not family sized. It goes up to 400 degrees, which has been hot enough for my purposes so far, but I know that some comparable air fryers offer higher temperature options. The touch screen works well for adjusting temperature but can be kind of a pain for adjusting cook time. You set the time in minutes - I think it defaults to like 10 or 15 minutes when you first turn it on. If you're cooking something for much shorter or longer than the default time it's kind of a pain having to press the button a bunch of times, as it doesn't always respond to every touch. I haven't used any of the preset cooking options so I can't speak to how well those work.I love that it comes with a big pack of liners and a small recipe book so you can get started right away. This was especially helpful for me as I'd never used an air fryer and didn't really even know where to begin with recipes. Overall I would recommend this for single people or couples looking for their first air fryer.",

                "reviewText": "I'd like to share my thoughts on this Digital Touchscreen 6 in 1 Air Fryer Oven, providing an honest 4-star review. While this appliance has its strengths, there are also a few aspects that fell short of my expectations.Starting with the positives, the Visible Window is a standout feature. It's incredibly convenient to be able to monitor the cooking process without needing to open the air fryer. This has certainly helped me prevent overcooking or burning my food, which is a significant plus.The 5.8 Quart Capacity, however, left me wanting more. It's a bit smaller than I had hoped for, making it more suitable for single individuals rather than larger households or gatherings. This is something to consider if you're planning to cook for multiple people.On the temperature front, I found the limitation to 400 degrees a bit restrictive. In my experience, a more versatile air fryer should ideally reach up to at least 450 degrees. This limitation impacted some recipes I wanted to try, so it's worth noting for those seeking higher cooking temperatures.One concern arose when I washed the appliance. The Visible Window ended up fogging up and remained that way for a couple of days, despite my attempts to blow it out with a hair dryer. While it eventually dried out, this experience made me more cautious about washing it in the future. I've decided to primarily use silicone liners and wipe the interior with a damp cloth to avoid a recurrence of the fogging issue.In sum, the Digital Touchscreen 6 in 1 Air Fryer Oven has its merits as well as areas that warrant consideration. It serves as a solid entry-level air fryer, particularly suited for single individuals. The Visible Window is a definite advantage, although the temperature limitation and the fogging issue post-wash are points to be aware of.",
