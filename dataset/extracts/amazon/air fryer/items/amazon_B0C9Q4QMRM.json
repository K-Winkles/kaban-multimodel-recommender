                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I LOVE this thing! It\u2019s really easy to use and super versatile! I was using it about 2 hours after I unpacked it - including running to get groceries! You push the power button in the center of the screen, and then choose one of 10 presets like fries, steaks, or baking OR you can control it yourself by selecting a temperature and time. Then you hit the power button again and it starts. Add two minutes to whatever time you want to allow for preheating. Stick your food in when the two minutes have passed. Hit the rotating button if you are using the rotating basket, rotisserie, or kebab wheel. That\u2019s it.It comes with:3 dehydrating trays for dehydrating, or just air frying in a single layer.1 air frying basket for anything that doesn\u2019t need to be in a single layer. Be sure to shake at halftime.1 rotisserie accessory (2 forks that connect to the long bar) for rotisserie chicken1 rotisserie basket (uses same long bar) anything that doesn\u2019t have a coating and is in small pieces. Cooks so evenly!1 rotisserie wheel (uses same long bar) with 8 kebabs for making kebabs.1 liner tray to line the bottom of the air fryer and catch any drips.What we made so far:Sweet potato hash for breakfast. I used the rotisserie basket and nearly filled it with sweet potatoes tossed in olive oil, onion powder, shallot powder, and seasoned pepper. They shrunk by about half and they were perfect \u2013 crispy exterior and pillowy interior.Pork tenderloin rubbed in olive oil, smoky paprika, garlic, onion, and mustard with garlicky brussels sprouts. These went in together. I had the pork on a dehydrator tray and the sprouts below in the air frying basket. Terrific all in one dinner.Chicken fingers coated in egg and then dipped in almond flour, cassava flour, and tapioca flour with a little chopped bacon and cheesy almond crackers. And garlic rosemary fries. These were awesome. I did the chicken fingers on the dehydrator trays. When I do chicken tenders, I pull that little tendon out and sometimes a little piece breaks off. The little pieces were way crispier, so next time, I\u2019ll cut the chicken fingers into 4. Not to get nerdy, but this thing loves surface area. The smaller the crispier! I did the fries in the rotisserie basket. My potatoes were big. If I\u2019m using potatoes that big again, I\u2019ll halve them.Tropi-bobs! Chicken, onion, sweet pepper, and pineapple kebabs brushed with sesame oil, salt, pepper, garlic, and ginger, and air fried on the rotisserie kebab wheel then brushed with a little soy sauce. Heavenly!For anything involving the rotisserie, I put them in with my hands so I could line up the square end of the rotisserie bar with the square receptacle on the left-side air-fryer wall. Then I used the football goalpost (I might be making up names for the tools) to remove the hot food and equipment from the air fryer. Totally recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Like this one so much better than my bravo xl one. Hopefully this one will last longer than a year. I was in the market looking for an air fryer since my other one happen to quit working all of a sudden. I needed something that had a bigger capacity close to my old one and a see through window. I was either going to to the kaloric one which had a gigantic size or the wowchef. What won me over was the rotisserie function. And I'm glad I got the wowchef. This thing crisp up food faster and more crispy than my less than 1 year old air fryer oven. It has preset buttons for different food items and you can change the time and temperature. It has a light which is awesome. It also comes with kabob attachments three thin and one big air fry baskets. And a flat tray. First thing I made was fries and let me tell you they came out great. This thing cooks it fast so be careful and go make sure you check on your food cuz it cooks it fast. May need to lower the cook time. Even though the temperature only goes go 400 degrees it is enough. It has a top burner element and a large fan. It doesn't have a toast option but what you need to do is hit the fry button and set the time for 5 to 6 minutes depending on thickness of bread and how toasty you like it. Probably want to flip it over at halfway mark. I've cooked tots, pizza bites, chicken tenders, pizza, cakes and cookie with is machine. Fyi dont just throw frozen Cookie onto the air fryer tray it will fall thru the wire while cooking learned that the hard way. Gotta use the bottom drip tray and line it with parchment paper. For cakes and brownies gotta cook it less than and set it close to bottom. Top will burn if you use the cook time on the box. Only thing negative about this machine is the crumbs catching on the front window. Kinda hard to clean plus it falls through the cracks and ends up on the counter. Also what's cool about this it has suction cups to hold the unit from moving. And for safety it has a thicker wire compared to my bravo xl where the thin cord on the bravo would get hot to the touch. But not with wowchef. Overall very satisfied with this airfryer.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not a great cook, tho I can usually manage my way thru a recipe, so I decided to show a photo of the air fryer in dehydrator use. As a widow living alone, too often some of my vegetables go bad before I can use them. THIS wonderful machine with its terrific dehydrator function will put an end to that! Now I can have certain veggies dehydrated for use in cooking and won't need to always have fresh on hand - celery, bell peppers, mushrooms (shown), onions !!! - and other goodies. It's important to dehydrate fruit and vegetables at lower temperatures to preserve the enzymes. THIS wonderful machine does that - starts at 90 degrees F.As for all the other fab functions, many of which I haven't even tried yet, I love how the machine operates. It's so easy to navigate, so intuitive. It doesn't heat up externally at all (well, okay, SOME), the oven light is great, and it's nearly silent.Now I just have to learn better work habits on my part. My instant pot spoiled me in terms of containing the mess, so I have been a little all-thumbs with this new purchase and making more mess than I like. So I'm trying to establish routines and procedures to minimize cleanup while efficiently managing the trays, etc. I need something to put the trays on when I take them out of the machine, for example. But I'll get to where I need to be: the simply divine chicken thighs I cooked demand it!I'm really pleased with this purchase and recommend it highly.",

I've tried 3 different ways to cook frozen pizza and all three times it NEVER cooked the bottom crust but burned the top, the pepperoni came out as crispy as bacon and the cheese was burnt. I'm thinking of buying a pizza stone but that adds to the price of the air fryer. I am giving it a three stars because of the French fries, but it is a one star for the pizza.
