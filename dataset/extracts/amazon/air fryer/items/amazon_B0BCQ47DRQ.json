                "reviewText": "Purchased these specifically because I saw that they would fit in my ninja dual air fryer. I just got it as an \"upgrade\" to my older yedi air fryer. I previously used a different brand of parchment paper baskets in that one but they don't fit in here so I bought these instead. However, these don't fit well either. They are too tall slightly so that they have issues with burning on the tops of them, I have to either trim them slightly before use or fold them down and hope that they stay that way during the cooking process. Other than that issue they are fine but the burning is a bit concerning. The first time using them there was some smoke in the air fryer as well. I had food on them and did not put them in during the preheat portion. they were only in the air fryer for around 15 minutes to make sweet potato fries and this was with shaking them halfway through too.",
