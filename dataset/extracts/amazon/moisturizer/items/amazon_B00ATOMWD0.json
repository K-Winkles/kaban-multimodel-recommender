                "reviewText": ">Aurora Lite< von Softwareschmiede noowanda ist ein kleines Android-Tool, mit dem man Bilder gestalten kann, die dem Himmel \u00e4hneln, der mit Nordlichtern \u00fcberzogen ist. Zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen in der Lite-Version nur die additiven Grundfarben Rot, Gr\u00fcn und Blau, aber diese k\u00f6nnen sich \u00fcberlagern, wodurch weitere Farben entstehen. Kommen alle drei Grundfarben an einem Punkt zusammen, entsteht Wei\u00df. Die Bilder entstehen, indem man mit dem Finger \u00fcber das Tablet streicht. Zur Auswahl stehen drei Strichbreiten (schmal bis breit). Die Bilder, die man herstellen kann, lassen sich auch abspeichern. Ich finde, dass dies ein sehr sch\u00f6nes Tool ist, um Wallpapers f\u00fcr den Hintergrund von Tablet-PCs selbst zu gestalten. Die volle Punktzahl habe ich vergeben, da das Tool sehr gut funktioniert und auf meinem Nexus 7 auch stabil lief.",
