                "reviewText": "Having been a Sense USANA (and vitamin) user for years, I found myself reviewing products because I had switched over to Shakeology for my nutrition and wanted to see if I should consider my membership for the Sense face products. When I started the hunt for a new moisturizer, having quality ingredients was more important than the look, feel or smell. After a tremendous of internet research from physicians, cosmeticians and of course Dr. Oz. I narrowed my selection down to 3 products to try, which I used each for a period of 2 weeks (which seemed long enough to see a difference, but also short enough to give each a try prior to any life changing face dramatizations.The products are:Oz Naturals: Hyaluronic Serum plus Vitamin C, with Sea Infused MoisturizerBody Merry: Hyaluronic Serum, with Body Merry Super C-22 Moisturizer and their Anti-Aging night creamAdvanced Dermatology: 5 part \"regimen\" includes a serum plus moisturizer as well as cleanser, night wrinkle cream.These were compared against Sense Perfecting Essence, Serum Intensive and Eye Nourisher (products which I'd used religiously for 8 years).As far as the ingredients go, each were comparable, although Advanced Dermatology's ingredients were challenging to find prior to purchase, I actually had to call the company and request they send in email. The primary differences I noted were that the only product that did not have Water as the first ingredient in the moisturizer was Body Merry's. Each product contained a variety of elements known to reduce fine lines/wrinkles/age spots, such as Vitamin's E, aloe, green tea, witch hazel, retinol, grapeseed oil, vitamin c.Price wise, all three products are comparable if considering adding the products together to match Advanced Dermatology's 5 part regimen which is on \"sale\" for $59.95. I had been paying approximately $100 every 60 days for my Usana products, so to mean spending $45-60 was reasonable. Advanced Dermatology makes you purchase all pieces together, which, if you are just looking for one part of the package is a disadvantage.Each trial run was done as recommended by the company as far as the order of products/application time was concerned. It's worthy to note that from a purely customer service standpoint, Body Merry reached out with a lovely offer to purchase the serum at a discount rate, and in their \"amazon blast email\" (which many companies send after a purchase) gave a brief bullet point email of how to use the product per your skin type, which I greatly appreciated from both a consumer and a marketing standpoint, instead of asking for reviews, etc.Now a bit about my face, I'm 36 and am just starting to see some fine lines around my eyes. I use Clarisonic Mia First which manages to keep my skin relatively \"taut\" and youthful. I have highly sensitive skin and rash easily. If I use a goopy moisturizer my face will break out and be greasy for days, I am not daring when it comes to bouncing around on products as it inevitably results in a gnarly rash. I am a \"Dove\" soap person and am very particular on the products I use on my skin, and there are very few that I use, as I'm a busy person who doesn't spend a lot of time in the bathroom. For the past 8 years I have used ONLY: Dove soap (whole body and as my face cleanser), Usana Perfecting Essence moisturizer, Usana Body Lotion, Clinique makeup products. Prior to Usana, in my early 20's, I used Dermalogica moisturizer. I occasionally will use JR Watkins lotion for smelly fun and only use Ocean Potion sunscreens. I am very particular about ingredients, the wholeness and effectiveness of them and the long term consistency of a product.Here's the lay persons review for each -Oz Naturals:This product is mostly natural, it's not full of amazing smells (which typically I am a fan of a lack there-of smell, as I don't like over frou-frou perfume speaking, however this has a bit of an algae smell). Applying the serum is much like any other, it comes with an eye dropper in a glass bottle, two drops will cover your entire face. It goes on smoothly, glossy but does (like other serums) have a slightly sticky feel. The moisturizer is thin straight out of the bottle, which means it runs a little on your fingers, and is an orange color, it goes on gummy. That said, it quickly dries and does not feel thick on your face. In spite of being a daytime moisturizer I found myself having a hard time applying this in the morning, as it does not give your face that \"ahhh fresh, soft\" feel straight out of the shower in preparation for the day. This product does a pretty decent job of reducing fine lines and wrinkles, and I was increasing impressed when I used it on a burn (imagery on instagram) of how quickly it healed the burn without scarring. For a 98 percent natural product, I would give this 4 stars, they could work on thickening it to make it more manageable. But I absolutely love that it has the sea kelp/algae which the other products did not. Unlike other reports, I used it every other night on my skin and did not have the breakouts others spoke of, and my face did not feel greasy at any time while using this product. I did notice more than anything that it had a \"glowy\" and \"thicker\" appearance, rather than its ability to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.Body Merry:This product's packaging was not as jazzy as the other two products, with what seemed like paper affixed labels from a home printer. What I learned when I came back to buy their night cream is that they recently changed their packaging to a more fun feel. What's inside was truly fantastic. It's difficult to express how all around happy and excited I am that there is a product that is reasonably priced that truly works and is made of fantastic ingredients. Being that this product had a high concentration of retinol and I have sensitive skin I used it only 3 times per week to begin. The serum much like Oz Naturals came with an eye dropper in a glass bottle. I originally started with the Super-C 22 cream during the day, every day, and was so insanely impressed with the instant results using the Hyaluronic serum at night and the cream during the day, that I decided to purchase the Anti-aging night cream. After just a week I was able to increase to the retinol product every night. The results were positively instant. I crave the moisture of the night cream after using the serum at night, despite that the serum goes on smooth and isn't greasy, gummy or anything otherwise. The night cream really tops off the experience, a little dabble goes a long way. In the morning, the sun of the day prior is gone. Then I start my day with the Super-C-22. I could not be more impressed with the way my face looks and feels. I was at a pool party, about 2 weeks after beginning this treatment and had a 26 year old tell me that \"whatever I'm doing, I'm killin it, because (your) face looks amazing.\" A few people at the party thought I was in my mid-20's. As I mentioned in the beginning, I had started this search for new creams because I had started to notice fine lines, they are gone. I attribute that exclusively to Body Merry. Now here's the real kicker. I was so impressed, and in love with the Body Merry products (especially for this price) that I didn't bother to buy the Advanced Dermatology product, and won't. The Body Merry team has stayed in touch with follow up emails, which for a face product company I am impressed with. I was not paid for any reviews and purchased everything on my own, but they still reached out, something I would only expect if they knew I was reviewing it. If you are serious about your skin care regime, and are looking for a new treatment, take it from a girl who spent weeks researching, and weeks upon weeks trying different products. This works.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this night cream because I was looking for a product with niacinamide to help lessen some of the dark spots I have from sun exposure on my face. I use it almost every night and I have seen some slight fading but I am also using other skin care products that are supposed to help out as well, so I don't know how much credit to give to this night cream alone.I find it very pleasant and it doesn't irritate my skin, or have any strong odor which is great. It has a really nice texture- not greasy but it does feel like it gives your skin a lot of moisture so I wouldn't wear it during the day.It's hard to tell from the packaging how much niacinamide is actually in this product so if you are looking to really reap the benefits of this active ingredient you might want to use a niacinamide serum where you know the % of niacinamide.",

                "reviewText": "So far so good. I am a 59-year-old woman who has bad under eye circles, folds above my nose in between my eyes, and deepening folds around my nose/mouth area. I also have rosacea on my chin and cheeks. Otherwise, my complexion is pretty smooth, just blotchy from rosacea. For the last year, I have been using Lancome Absolue in the gold jars ($250 for day and night cream). I finally ran out of the day cream and needed a relacement. I love the Lancome but I can't pay that kind of money unless it is going to be a real miracle cream. So, I went to Amazon to shop for a replacement cream (like I do everything these days). I ran across Body Merry when I was searching for some stretch mark cream for my pregnant daughter. The reviews were all pretty good and I couldn't believe the price - what a savings! So I figured, what the heck. Let's give a try. So, I purchased this one month ago.Another lady had posted some before/after pics and that really helped me. So I thought I would do the same and if I noticed improvement, I would post them, if I didn't I would send the product back because of the guarantee Body Merry offers. Well, I believe I see a little improvement which is wonderful for someone pushing 60. Here they are for you to judge as well - before and after one month of pretty consistent use morning and evening (90%).By the way, I love the way the product feels. Very smooth, very clean. It soaks right into your face and just leaves it feeling moisturized and fresh. I purchase four products: Eye Cream, Super C-22 daytime moisturizer, nighttime moisturizer, and the Super 6 Serum. I have read reviews on the eye cream that some people didn't like the way it smells - it does have a bit of a eucalyptus aroma. It's a light scent that quickly goes away, but I don't mind it because it makes me feel like I'm applying a natural product that has a good ingredient to help my eye area. I also use it on my eyelids, lightly, and I am beginning to see an improvement in the droopiness of my eye lids. The C22 day cream is wonderful and has a fresh citrus (orange) scent. This too goes away as the moisture soaks in. I apply the day cream and wait 2-3 minutes before applying makeup. The nighttime moisture is a heavier cream that I apply after removing my makeup at night (along with the eye cream). I have normal to dry skin that dries out over night; except when I use this cream. Also, when I get up in the mornings, I do not have rosacea face like I used to (even with the Absolue). Some days I am tempted not to wear makeup at all; and some days I just put on a light application of powder and a little blush and lipstick. I still just can't get over the price on this. That's why I purchased it on auto ship - to enjoy the price for as long as possible.Hope your experience is as good as mine.",
