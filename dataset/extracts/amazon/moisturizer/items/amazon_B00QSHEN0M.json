The texture is a bit whipped and feels so good on my skin. It absorbs nicely and my face still feels soft the next morning. There is a scent but it is light and earthy. I also like that the jar is glass and can be recycled or repurposed. This is my first time trying a Burt's Bees facial product and I am impressed and will be trying more of their products. I can't speak to its' antiaging properties yet, but at least my skin feels wonderful.",

These are small jars, but both products go very far; you don't need to use but a small amount, as they are very effective. And they do not feel at all greasy, which some face creams -- especially for nighttime use -- often do. I highly recommend these products!",

I also just recently ordered they're masquera, and that is amazing as well..For the last 4 or 5 years I have had a lot of issues with irritable dry flaky skin. For the last few years I have been using only the most expensive face creams from brands like Lauriel or Olay, which were OK but the best i could find (and i have tried almost all possible) . This face lotion is %100 better than any other face lotion on the market, even ones that are twice the price. It leaves my skin feeling smoother than any other lotion and it doesn't leave a greasy feel like the other one that I was using. The smell is amazing and I am in love with it. I've had a couple dry patches on my skin for years. That just never go away. And this stuff makes them feel so much better they're actually disappearing. Also no more pimples and breakouts. I love that this lotion is 100% organic and 100% cruelty free, Which is why I decided to switch to this brand. And for many other reasons, I am so glad that I did. I will be a lifelong customer for all their products. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "...which makes sense since beeswax is on the front end. Beeswax might be used to retain moisture, but I don't like the waxy feel.On the positive side, it has a nice scent and my skin feels moisturized. But, most importantly.. none of the ingredients are toxic/carcinogenic/hormone disruptor, etc.I was surprised to learn that the cosmetics and personal beauty products industry is not regulated. Which explains why there are so many toxic ingredients in beauty products. It's shocking how much of a dumping ground it's become.Just for fun...grab one or two products you're currently using and do a quick research on how safe the first few ingredients are for use on skin/hair. You might be in for a surprise.For instance, a common ingredient in toothpaste is used in industrial floor cleaners. The four most used ingredients in the majority of sunscreens are carcinogenic. The first ingredient in Elf Skin 'Holy Hydration' (sold at Target and Amazon) is Avobenzone--a known hormone disrupter.. and carcinogenic.I've read that 60-70% of what you put on your skin is absorbed. Contrary to thinking it just stays on the skin.One website I use to find out if certain ingredients are safe to use on skin is Environmental Working Group. They also provide lists of skin creams, lotions and sunscreens that have been rated for safety based on scientific research of ingredients in the product. If there isn't much information on an ingredient, they list that too.The bottom line is, we have very little control over what we're exposed to in our environment. But, we can be more selective in what we put on our skin...",

I\u2019m 26 so I don\u2019t have wrinkles to test the fade. But it smells good, and it moisturizes well. I may keep this as a year round face moisturizer.",
