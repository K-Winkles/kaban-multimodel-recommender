It is so clean and you are not putting you fingers in over and over. I will continue to use this and not return to my old product.",

Doesn\u2019t clog pours either. And not to mention the push down top gives you the perfect amount to apply every time!! Love this and will continue to buy and recommend!",

I question whether there is any retinol in this at all as other retinol products I have tried seemed to help reduce redness and brown spots on my cheeks. While this product does just fine at moisturizing it is not helping to reduce redness, spots, or any other signs of aging. I've been using it consistently since I bought it and the jar is now empty and I will not be getting another.***Notice to Seller: Do not attempt to contact me about changing, deleting, or otherwise altering my review.
