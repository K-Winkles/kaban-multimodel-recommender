Made my skin worse.This stuff is so much cheaper than most other products but it\u2019s incredibly effective. I get a bottle of this and the Bulldog face wash every month. Idk why there negative reviews talking about smell. It doesn\u2019t smell like anything. Once, my partner said I smelled a little like apricot but it was 10 min after I had put this on.My only complaint with this is that the bottle top isn\u2019t always airtight, so sometimes, I go to apply the cream and at first, it\u2019s a weird dried-out texture, but then I just wash that off and get another dab and the 2nd dab is perfect since it didn\u2019t get dried out.",

                "reviewText": "I originally purchased this moisturizer for my husband about three years ago. He used it here and there, but regardless of the product, I could never get him into the habit of applying moisturizer of any kind. Then on a trip to visit family in the inland northwest during the month of February, I forgot my own moisturizer and opted to use my husband's, figuring it was better than nothing, especially in the brisk Washington weather. Honestly, I was very surprised to find how light, yet how hydrating and moisturizing this moisturizer is. I was delighted to find that it did not irritate my extremely sensitive skin and did not leave a greasy sheen, unlike my normal products. After adding this to my daily skin care regimen, I have found that my under eye area appears less crepe-y and the tone seems brighter.",
