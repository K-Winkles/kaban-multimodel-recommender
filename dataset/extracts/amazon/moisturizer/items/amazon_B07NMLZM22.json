                "reviewText": "It\u2019s an excellent cream to use under make-up! Wow for this price. I have a dry sensitive skin and I have tried so many famous brands, expensive renowned creams. I received a sample of this through purchase of other Korean beauty product in amazon and I loved it so much when I tried the sample! I didn\u2019t notice a difference right after I put it on my face, so I thought it was okay. It didn\u2019t seem super moisturizing like other cream as I felt very light and absorbed quickly. BUT I noticed this was different when I removed all the make up with my regular routine on the same day evening and on the next day morning! My skin was very soft and no dry feeling at all! I felt like my skin has been protected by this cream throughout the day. On the next day, I felt the same and my skin got even more soft and moisturized feeling. Finally I found something that protects my skin\u2019s moisture! And it is so cheap!!! I\u2019m not sure if this can help the extremely dry skin (as skin\u2019s nature moisture level would be already low) but I can recommend this to any other skin types!",

My skin tends to produce excess sebum (think thick & waxy, rather than oily) & my pores are extremely clog-prone. That being said I can\u2019t do very rich moisturizers, but do need a very hydrating one that easily absorbs into my skin, rather than sit on the surface of my skin to suffocate my pores & thus clog them. This is the best moisturizer I\u2019ve ever found. I\u2019m on my 4th repurchase of it & use it daily alongside the Laniage water sleeping mask at night. This is wonderful under make up, it smells amazing- like fruity pebbles or something, & one pot lasts me quite a long time. This is intended to hydrate & plump your skin with anti-aging benefits.",

                "reviewText": "I normally use Tidal by Sunday Riley and was looking for a more cost effective alternative , at first I wasn't really impressed but as I started to use this daily, I noticed my pores closing. I have pretty oily skin and this is comparable to the water based formula of what I'm used to using. I think I actually like it better. I really love the way it feels on my skin. The scent is ok, pretty mild. It's great under make up, others would not blend well with foundation and start balling up, but this one just melts in. I feel like it leaves a natural dewey finish as well. I love the natural ingredients too! Im really impressed for the price too you just cant beat it! I'll be buying more;) BTW, I'm not getting paid for this, just an honest review!",

She has acne issues and this is, according to her, \"the only moisturizer that feels good and doesn't cause break outs\". I had only used it twice, but wanted one for myself too so I bought another one. And - man - it's as fabulous as I wanted it to be. It smells beautiful (not too fragrant, just a nice clean smell), feels light and not oily and makes my skin glow in a beautiful, healthy way. I use it morning and night.",
