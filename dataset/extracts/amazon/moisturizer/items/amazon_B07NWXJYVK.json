                "reviewText": "This is the \"cleanest\" facial lotion I have ever found. By that I mean there is nothing in it that will cause me congestion (plugged pores that get loaded down with sebum and dead skin cells, and have tiny white heads most of the time-in some they can morph into comedones). I have only the former which have been increasing over time because I could never get rid of them despite using Salicylic Acid, Benzoyl Peroxide, and RetinA, All 3 caused me very dry skin and flakes because I wasn't using them correctly or enough or less, but mainly because I was also unknowingly putting ingredients back on my face that are known to cause congestion in the facial skin or elsewhere for some people and thus jinxing myself into this vicious cycle (and never really getting rid of the plugs for more than a day or two, and never completely). I am still working on it with much more info under my belt. This lotion is wonderful! It feels good going on, moisturizes beautifully and without a shiny finish, is organic and safe (a huge bonus for me as I switched to organic products well over 2 years ago), and will not contribute to my plugged pores. Even organics can have \"bad\"ingredients for those of us prone to congestion such as Coconut oil which is a VERY common ingredient. If interested, look up Comedogenic ratings online to find a wealth of info. I finally began doing my own research after going to a dermatologist where I live. He was no help at all. He didn't even SEE the plugs (whereas I easily saw them at home in my 10X mirror). When I asked him to put on his magnifying glasses, he finally did, (he is older and not wearing glasses to see close objects (his ego?) I felt he didn't care, but I was distressed about my skin because I wanted healthy skin, AND these plugs were increasing alarmingly. Under my eyes, nears my brows, my chin is a mess, and on both sides of my inner cheeks between my nose and mouth, (I also get them randomly anywhere). At nearly 70 years old, it's ridiculous to be struggling so much with this, isn't this in the realm of teens? Well, not for me. The derm did say that the older we get, the harder it is for our skin the get rid of dead skin cells that pile up on our skin. When younger, our skin cell turnover is much faster. Oh wow, I felt blessed, NOT.I've been researching and writing things down, including ALL comedogenic ingredients, etc. and have finally found this lotion. I am so excited.Just a bit more info: this lotion is pale yellow (a result from the golden yellow Jojoba oil), it comes unscented or scented, and the unscented has virtually no smell. It absorbs very rapidly. The container it is in is thoughtfully a simple pump kind that works so easily and keeps the lotion free from contamination--I can't emphasize this latter enough (I can tell it was chosen by a woman, thank goodness. Sorry guys. I'm sure some guys are thoughtful too about facial products, but not as often as women), how important not getting your cream or lotion in a jar is. Too easy to introduce bacteria. Thank you so much \"Awake Human\" for creating this well thought out and beautiful lotion that I love so much. I already ordered a backup. And thank you to all my fellow Amazon purchasers who took the time to read my wordy review. I hope this helps someone.",

                "reviewText": "I have normal to dry skin. Lately i started to look into professiknal skin care. And i have to tell you high price of other products that I've tried in the past does not guarantee it will work for you. This moisturizer is one of those that I've tried during last few months, tgeir price ranged from 10 to 60$ for similar size. I was sceptical at first, but surprised to see that there's literally nothing but natural stuff in its ingredients. Other 'odorless' products that I've tried in the past still had some smell, often very subtle, but unpleasant to me, and i am very sensitive. But this one does not have a smell at all, which works great for me. Also it goes on very smooth and does not leave a greasy feeling, although that's what usually left me with a feeling of my skin being hydrated during the day in the past. I've been using this product for about a week now and my skin looks more plump and bright. I do have fine lines/expression lines, im 33, and of course they did not disappear because of me using it. But i think this moisturizer does a very good job at keeping my skin calm, hydrated and healthy looking. Im happy with my purchase and will look into other products from this line if any.",

                "reviewText": "Might be passable as a nighttime moisturizer if you don't have anything better around, but it does not work under makeup/foundation for daytime. My face was soon covered with tiny clumps (large flakes) of the moisturizer mixed with my foundation. The more I tried to blend/rub it in, the more clumping I had. Aside from the makeup issue, I still had flakey skin after using this, and I had to apply coconut oil to my eye area and cheeks to get some relief from the tightness that this moisturizer created on my skin. I have blepharitis, and this moisturizer seems gentle enough to not kick up inflammation of the lids, but my eyes burned after applying it. Not horribly, but I could tell that there was something irritating them and making them look glassy. I like the wholesome scent, I love the ingredient list, and I think it may truly be smoothing out my complexion overall, but I will not buy this again.UPDATE: Excellent overnight moisturizer. My previous complaints about eye irritation are no longer, now that my eye condition has cleared up. Noticeable reduction in wrinkles, blotchiness, and otherwise crappy aging skin stuff.",

                "reviewText": "This moisturizer is really great, and I highly recommend it! It's lightweight, but it still moisturizes. I have fairly sensitive skin, but this doesn't clog my pores or irritate my skin at all. In fact, my spouse had some skin irritation from wearing a mask all day at work and this moisturizer helped sooth that irritated skin. It doesn't leave an oily feeling on the skin and it actually gets absorbed into the skin (which is great because my spouse hates moisturizer that leaves any sort of residue on the skin).Also, this moisturizer is truly unscented! Other unscented moisturizer brands that I've tried aren't actually unscented- they smell kind of artificial. This one doesn't smell like anything.I'm so grateful to have found a good face moisturizer that's affordable and is, most importantly, vegan and cruelty-free! I'll definitely be purchasing this again.",

Highly recommended. Please don't ever stop making this. This is an absolutely wonderful product.",
