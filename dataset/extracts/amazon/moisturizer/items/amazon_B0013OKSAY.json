                "reviewText": "I have used this product now for several years and absolutely love it. A few years back I made a trip to the dermatologist who informed me that really all people (but especially those with olive skin like me) should be wearing SPF 30 sunscreen every day, a hat, and sunglasses every time they go out in the sun. Well I couldn't commit to wearing a hat and sunglasses for the rest of my life as I am not a private detective and don't own that many cute hats anyway, but I could commit to upping my sunscreen. I had previously used a few products with 15 SPF or similar ranges, but he insisted that 30 SPF was where it's at. He said that over 30 SPF and you aren't really blocking anything extra, just throwing more on to make yourself feel better, but under 30 SPF you are still getting some harmful rays coming through. So I set off in search of a \"regular\" moisturizer that would not feel, smell, or look like sunscreen when it went on. After some research, I narrowed it down to Neutrogena and Aveeno. I tried both as well as a few others. The others felt like sunscreen as in the smelly, strong, burning stuff you thrown on your kids when you are spending all day at the Water Park. No way that was going to work for me every day. Then I tried the Neutrogena. It was okay . . . slightly better than the regular sunscreen but it still had that tangy smell to me and still burned slightly when I put it on. Finally I got to the Aveeno brand and was, frankly, delighted to find that it felt, smelled, and looked just like REGULAR moisturizer but with the added benefit of having a 30 SPF rating. I have now used it for 4 or 5 years. I put it on every morning before I put my make-up on. It smells like nothing, it is lightweight (not greasy), and when I smear it all over my face during a dry-skin episode it STILL doesn't feel greasy. In addition, I can testify to the strength of the SPF because there have been many occasions when I have been out with family and friends and it unexpectedly gets very sunny and/or we are stuck somewhere in the sun for much longer than we expected and while they come home with red noses and cheery cheeks, without even a second thought, I had protective on my skin all day such that I only have the lightest tan. Sunscreen has never been so painless!",

The difference of my skin post-shower when I use it vs when I don't is huge. I try to use this every evening after my shower, and again every morning after I wash my face and before I put make-up on. I've also had my fiance use it to help with dry patches, and I can visibly see a difference when he uses it for a few days in a row. He has sensitive skin and very dry skin, and it doesn't irritate his skin. It doesn't make the skin feel oily or anything. It just feels like it gives my skin life.",

He said wash with Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Cleanser, use this Clinical Strength Vitamin C Serum 20% second, then the Aveeno Postively Radiant, then if going outside for more than 30 min., a SPF 30 sunscreen. He said he likes Neutrogena products because they work well and are reasonably priced. I have been using this regime for about 2 weeks now since ordering all from amazon.com as he recommended because of price (I would have anyway, they are my preferred place to shop). I have seen the blackheads almost all disappear, no kidding! I am amazed! I am very happy, nothing in all my years of trying many products in all price ranges have done this! This is my new 3some! I am passing this along to everybody! I am 63, I've always had oily skin, not as much since I've gotten older, but still around my nose. I don't think this is something he just tells some, he has preprinted papers I think he gives to those who ask. He had the paper carton the Coui vitamin C serum come in to show you what to get along with the printed paper, one for the Aveeno also. It has to be POSITIVELY RADIANT though he said! I am thinking I am finally on the right track. He said the wrinkles and the dark age spots would take a little longer, but to be patient and I can do that! So, I am passing this on to all those who care to try it out.",
