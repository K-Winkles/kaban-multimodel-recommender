        "description": "Made with 1% Aloe Vera Extract and Ultra-Hydrating Lipids, Vaseline Intensive Care Soothing Hydration Lotion helps keep your skin looking healthy and hydrated. With daily exposure to environmental triggers (like wind, lack of humidity, and sun), skin's natural moisture barrier can break down, allowing for water to escape the skin. Our Soothing Hydration body lotion fortifies the skin barrier and replenish moisture to allow the skin's natural barrier to recover. Vaseline Intensive Care Soothing Hydration Lotion, formulated with Ultra-Hydrating Lipids and Aloe Vera Extract, locks in moisture and soothes dry skin. This body moisturizer is clinically tested to provide 88% more moisture (vs. untreated skin). This body lotion for dry skin absorbs fast for rich moisturization without the residue and provides 48-hour moisture. Use this dermatologist-tested body lotion daily on dry, rough skin for stronger, noticeably healthy skin. Just apply to your skin for hydrating relief. This Vaseline lotion bottle is made of 50% recycled plastic. Our ambition is to get to 100% recycled plastic in the near future. Since 2018, we've used 337 Metric Tons of recycled plastic across the Vaseline product portfolio in North America. Our Intensive Care range works to heal dry skin from deep within.",
