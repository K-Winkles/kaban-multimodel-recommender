I have extremely dry skin, and eczema on my face. Most other moisturizers are sucked up and I have to use mega amounts to make a difference, and then they ball off!? This stuff is amazing! It absorbed into my skin so fast and made my makeup apply so smooth. At the end of the day I was - dare I say it - a little on the oily side! Amazing. This is infused with hylaronic acids and aloe vera so it really helps your skin retain moisture. I was sent this to review by GlamSense, but thoughts and opinions are always my own. This moisturizer is quickly replacing my high end favourites. I will also say that this does have a strong scent at first, but the smell does seem to dissipate shortly after, I am sensitive to scents and it did not bother me.",
