This was the first time I had ever heard those words. I received a sample of this product and fell in love with it. Though, this is normally more than what I spend on personal care for one product, the product lasts forever as you truly only need a pea-sized amount. It spreads easily and leaves my skin silky and smooth even just after application. Of course, I always put a heavier moisturizer on top. It has truly evened out my complexion and eliminated my dry spots. The scent is light and clean and there is not greasy feeling after using, even on my fingers.",

This product is amazing, I will not be going back to the other moisturizer. It makes your skin feel so supple and hydrated with zero heaviness or greasy feeling! My teenage daughter and husband now also use it! I definitely recommend it!!",
