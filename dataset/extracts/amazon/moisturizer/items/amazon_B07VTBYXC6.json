When I went to order it, they had changed the product and upped the price, which spurred me to find this brand. My skin is combination, and in some places very oily. I can NOT use anything with fragrance or oil, or it will break me out- every time. This is one of the reasons it has been so hard for me to part with my previous brand. BUT, this moisturizer is amazing! It is light weight, so it doesn't overload my oily areas, and I can use more in the drier areas. It has helped my skin tone and texture and I have noticed even less small underlying bumps on my face. It works perfectly for my sensitive skin, and I am so happy to have found it here on Amazon. Will be buying more... Keep making this PLEASE!",

                "reviewText": "I had no expectations when buying this since finding a good moisturizer for my finicky, combo skin and have been pleasantly surprised! My only hope for this had been for it to be decent enough to make it to the next moisturizer I would try, in search of a great one.I need face moisturizer to not feel too thick during the summer (now) but not be so light it doesn't do anything. I need it to not cause my skin to break out OR react allergically. I prefer to not feel it on my face a while after applying it, as some do.Scents are tricky -- I don't mind a light scent, but many are too strong, or turn out to be a scent I don't love (and when you're putting it on your face you need to love it). Also, some unscented stuff actually has a smell, which I do NOT love.NOT ONLY does this moisturizer fit all those criteria, but I noticed my skin actually looks better than ever! AND there truly is no scent, good or bad!!Tip: I don't use a full pump of the moisturizer on my face, since that does lead to it not fully absorbing, and leaving that tacky, still-there feeling. I consider this a bonus, though, since it means a bottle will go farther!",
