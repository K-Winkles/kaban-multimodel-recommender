I really like this moisturizer, it is a little lighter than I thought so it feels almost like a gel. I wish it was a little thicker only because my skin is mixed so there are times when it\u2019s dry. Not saying it didn\u2019t work on me, it feels amazing, skin looks dewy but probably it\u2019s only the lightness. I come from using DDF for about +10 years, but I got disappointed with how their prices are high and quality isn\u2019t what it used to be. I was afraid Tula wouldn\u2019t work but I\u2019m definitely happy and will probably get more of their products",

                "reviewText": "I tested this in a store and waited for a few hours to assess home my skin felt. It felt so good! This diesn't replace a daily moisturizer, but as it says, is one of those treats for the skin when it is experiencing extra dryness and stress. I don't put it on over make-up and I have a few makeup-free days most weeks; that's when Tula does its thing! It's a little on the pricey side for my budget, but it is a treat, and a very helpful one at that.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this moisturizer! It's oil-free, so great for my combination skin (I am 37 years old... still have slight breakouts, but primarily normal to dry skin). It's perfect to wear under makeup or alone. Now that it's winter, I do use their night and day cream for added moisture. The bottle lasts a solid 2 months for me... using about 1.5 times / day. Pump is super easy to use. No strong scent. Nice work, Tula!",
