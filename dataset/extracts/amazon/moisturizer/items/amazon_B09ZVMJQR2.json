The added vitamin repair is worth it alone. I struggled with dry skin always pealing on my nose. This helped fix the issue and hydrated my skin a lot. This is much more preferable to use after being exposed to the sun all day compared to aloe. This is a silky cream that is fast absorbing with a clean non oily feeling. Even though it\u2019s listed as unscented it does have a lovely light floral scent.",

I had to wash my and get the smell off.That doesn't mean it isn't a good product, it just didn't smell good to me.The company does have a lot of wasted packaging, IMHO. It was about twice the size of the container. I hope they can fix that since they aren't fooling anyone that the container is bigger than the packaging based on the weight of the product.I hope you enjoy the product",
