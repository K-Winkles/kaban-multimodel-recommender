The jars look nearly identical so pay attention to the fine print.I was recommended this product for those with DRY skin (For reference, I am 30 and have always had dry, peeling skin and breakouts).I LOVE the way this feels. I use it nightly, after my CeraVe face wash and witch hazel/rose water toner, and my face feels very clean and smooth and supple. The dryness and peeling issues are gone. My face looks and feels smoother. Even after waking up the next morning, it still feels good. This stuff is the bomb. Will continue to buy when this tub runs out. So good and so worth the price!

                "reviewText": "This is a lifesaver for my dry, sensitive skin. My skin has been getting increasingly sensitive over the last few years. The face wash and lotion I was using to keep my skin clear was also making my cheeks and forehead dry and flaky so I started looking for new products.I'm still looking for the perfect face wash, but this is my is go-to lotion. It absorbs easily and works well under makeup. Since I switched to a gentler face wash, this lotion in the morning, and a lotion mask at night, I don't get any dryness or flakiness unless the weather is particularly bad.My skin has never felt better. Using products better suited for my skin has also decreased blemishes. I'm on my second jar, and as long as the formula (and my skin) stays the same, I will keep buying.",
