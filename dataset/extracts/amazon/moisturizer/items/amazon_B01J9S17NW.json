        "description": "Vaseline Men's Healing Moisture Fast Absorbing Body Lotion has been specially formulated to hydrate and restore dry or cracked skin. This body lotion for men is formulated with Ultra-Hydrating Lipids that fortify the skin barrier and replenish moisture. With daily exposure to environmental triggers (like wind, lack of humidity, and sun), skin's natural moisture barrier can break down, allowing water to escape the skin. But the Ultra-Hydrating lipids in our lotion fortify the skin barrier and replenish moisture to allow the skin's natural barrier to recover. This lotion locks in moisture and promotes smooth, naturally glowing skin. The body moisturizer is clinically tested to provide 90% more moisture (vs. untreated skin). This lotion for dry skin absorbs fast and provides 48-hour moisture. Use this dermatologist-tested body lotion daily on dry, rough skin for stronger, noticeably healthier skin. Made of 50% recycled plastic, our ambition is to get to 100% recycled plastic in the near future. Since 2018, we've used 337 Metric Tons of recycled plastic across the Vaseline product portfolio in North America. Vaseline Men range works to heal dry skin from deep within. Vaseline has a range of products to help heal, soothe, and moisturize all skin.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Vaseline Men's Healing Moisture Hand & Body Lotion for my husband, and it has quickly become a household favorite! If you're on the hunt for a fast-absorbing, effective solution for dry or cracked skin, look no further.First and foremost, the speed at which this lotion absorbs into the skin is impressive. No greasy residue, just instant relief. My husband, who is usually hesitant about using lotions, loves how this one doesn't leave a sticky or oily feeling. It's a game-changer for him, and I've noticed a significant improvement in the moisture levels of his skin.The healing properties are remarkable. His hands, which are prone to dryness and cracking, have become noticeably softer and smoother since using this lotion. The formula is gentle yet powerful, making it an ideal solution for daily use without causing any irritation.The subtle, masculine fragrance is another plus. It's not overpowering but leaves a fresh and clean scent that lingers just enough. The pump dispenser is practical and ensures that the lotion is dispensed in the right quantity, preventing unnecessary waste.The size of the bottle is generous, offering great value for the price. With daily use, the lotion has lasted longer than expected, proving that a little goes a long way. It has become a staple in my husband's grooming routine, and I can confidently say that his skin has never looked or felt better.In conclusion, Vaseline Men's Healing Moisture Hand & Body Lotion is a five-star product that delivers on its promises. If you're searching for a reliable, fast-absorbing lotion for dry or cracked skin, this is the one. My husband is a satisfied customer, and we'll definitely be repurchasing in the future.",
