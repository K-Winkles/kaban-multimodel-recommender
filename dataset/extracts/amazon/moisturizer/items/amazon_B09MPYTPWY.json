                "reviewText": "At the time of writing this review, I flip flop between 4 and 5 stars. I have been using this for almost a week. Yesterday, when I looked in the mirror, I felt that my skin looked really good. I was trying to figure out why then remembered I have been trying this out for almost a week. I will credit the moisturizer to how my skin looks.What this is:This is an organic kombucha collagen cream. It is vegan. 1.69 ounces that is in a small wide mouth jar. I can easily dip my fingers in.I used it every morning and every other night. It has a nice very light pleasant scent to it. It is a thick cream.My skin absorbed it easily. It never looked greasy. It moisturizes very well.It has only been not even a complete week but do I notice any plumping from the collagen? No. Not in a week. When I was observing my skin yesterday, I felt my skin looked brighter and healthier.What I do notice is that it makes a very strong barrier on my face. If I start to perspire, the sweat doesn't act the same way on my face. This is why I want to give it 4 stars. I feel that my face can't rid itself of the sweat as easily. It almost feels like the sweat just sticks to my face. The cream holding it in place.In the end, I am giving this 4 stars because of the sweat factor. I am an active person who goes to the gym and martial arts classes. I felt the sweat couldn't get out through the moisturizer. I will continue to use it, but only at night before bed.",

                "reviewText": "This is such a lovely and luxurious face cream! Fresh herbaceous scent wafts towards you as you apply this deliciously light but extremely hydrating cream/lotion. It sinks into skin quickly and easily leaving my skin soft with a natural looking satin finish. It wears well under my silicone primer and water based makeup. This is a perfect choice for those with any skin type, including my own, dry/combo, who want all day hydration but no heavy or greasy feel. It is gentle and does not irritate sensitive areas that are prone to redden or flake.",

                "reviewText": "I was surprised at the texture of this moisturizer. It reminds me of LaMer\u2019s original formula, but this appears to be a MUCH cleaner formula. The cream is very rich, but absorbs quickly and completely. The scent makes me think of fir trees; I like patchouli, but sadly, I could not detect it here.My skin is left moist without being tacky; for me this is a great daytime cream. It layers nicely over essence and serums without pilling. No breakouts, which I occasionally experience with new products. Over time I think this has made my skin a bit more calm despite being winter in New England, which I think means it has helped repair my moisture barrier.This currently sells for $35.10, which is a steal for this 1.7 ounce jar. I hope it doesn\u2019t triple in price by the time I need to restock \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb",
