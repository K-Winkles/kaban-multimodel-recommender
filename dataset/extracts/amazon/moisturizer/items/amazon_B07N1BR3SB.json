                "reviewText": "I have combination/oily skin with mild-moderate (it flares up at times) acne. Most of the year I have to use a light weight moisturizer before my acne treament. But during winter or when my skin is dehydrated I need a heavier moisturizer. Unfortunately what helps my dehydrated skin ends up worsening my acne after consistent use. So I'm super grateful when I find moisturizers that work. This works and while it goes on a little heavy it completely rubs right in and feels light.",

                "reviewText": "I picked up this product on the recommendation of a board-certified dermatologist on YouTube. Unfortunately, I don't feel like this product works on my normal/dry skin. For starters, it doesn't really moisturize me. After applying it feels like there's a film on my face. Also it pills which is really annoying when applying my sunscreen. My sunscreen isn't the issue because I also tried it with another moisturizer and it was fine. So yeah no, this is going to be a no for me.",

This moisturizer is amazing, it feels like a drink of water for my skin and it doesn't feel waxing or make my face sweat like other moisturizers have. Great product, I'll be back to try other things in her line.",
