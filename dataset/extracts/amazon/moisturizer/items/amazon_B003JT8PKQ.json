Yes, you may have noticed that we have updated our packaging to showcase our new & improved formula with Pro-Ceramide. This exciting change reflects our commitment to delivering high-quality products. You may receive either design for a short time. Did Lubriderm change their formulas? Yes, Lubriderm has made some exciting changes to enhance our products! We have improved our formulas including the addition of Pro-Ceramide, but don\u2019t worry-our lotions are still fast-absorbing with a clean, non-greasy feel. What is Pro-Ceramide and why is it important? Pro-Ceramide has been shown to penetrate within skin\u2019s surface layers and help support your skin\u2019s natural Ceramide levels. Ceramides play a role in helping maintain a healthy moisture barrier which helps retain moisture within your skin\u2019s surface. Is Lubriderm lotion safe for use on tattoos? Experts recommend using a water-based lotion to hydrate tattooed skin. Lubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion Fragrance Free is a gentle, water-based, unscented lotion that quickly absorbs and moisturizes for healthy-looking skin. Which Lubriderm lotion is best for winter skin? Dry, winter air coupled with heat indoors can lead to very dry skin. Intensely moisturizing products such as Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Moisturizing Cream Fragrance-Free replenish extra dry skin and help to restore your skin's moisture barrier.",

                "reviewText": "First, some things to understand:I am a pop skincare girlie. I have tried so many affordable skin care productsand I have been heavy into the skincare scene for YEARS. I love flashy packaging and pretty niche products.Second, I am a dry skin girlie. DRY-dry but I have always wanted soft, supple skin.Third, I hate the feeling of thick lotion on my body.I have used oil, cream, lotion, washes, treatments etc on my body for years in the pursuit of soft skin. My legs and areas that rub clothes aren\u2019t like, cracking dry, but never seem to retain moisture. My forearms are also always dry.I got a small bottle of this from target to carry in my purse and I\u2019d use it intermittently on my arms and hands throughout the day. It has a soft, clean scent that kind of reminds me of my grandma but not in a bad way at all. Just clean and subtle. It works so well. My skin feels refreshed after applying with no heavy feel.I am obsessed with this lotion and bought 3 giant bottles to keep in all my bathrooms at home. I put it on when I get out of the shower on damp skin. It absorbs quickly and doesn\u2019t have a greasy feel that feels gross when putting on a robe.While it does make my skin feel hydrated immediately, over time (about a month), with continued use, I am finally soft all over, all of the time.For all of the gimmicks and flashy packaging and marketing out there, nothing has worked so well. I feel so smooth and soft and my skin hasn\u2019t been uncomfortably tight once.If I miss a day, I am still soft. I feel like something I\u2019m this has improved the health of my skin and makes it easier to maintain healthy moisture on its own.10/10 highly recommend",

                "reviewText": "Maybe it's just me and the fact that i never use these pump type of bottles, but trying to get the first pump ended with me pulling off the pump part. Normally, you push and twist these things and they'll pop out then work... this one doesn't do that. There is no sticker or hints on how to get it working right. I tried for 15 minutes to do it without breaking something then just pulled it off in frustration. I did manage to put it back on by lining up the piece right and giving it one hard pump to click it back into place, now it works as intended. I just really wish it had a screw top or a cap with anything but that pump. The lotion itself is excellent. I work outdoors and my cheeks nose and forehead get windburned or sun burned all the time. I've used Lubriderm for years, it's the only lotion I'll use on my face. I even use it after every shave. It's not greasy and won't make you break out like other lotions. Excellent product... just find a a better cap that fits this bottle and you're golden.",
