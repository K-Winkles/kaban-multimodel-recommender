                "reviewText": "I have been using this moisturizer for 2 years now. I discovered Andalou products & this specific one while doing a desperate search for a non-greasy moisturizer that wouldn\u2019t clog my pores. I stumbled upon a gem. That\u2019s for sure! \u2764\ufe0f I have naturally very oily prone skin & every product I used prior to this gave me pimples, blemishes, & also made my skin more oily. I used to never walk out of the house without my makeup on. Now I feel confident enough to go bare faced. My skin is smooth, no redness, no dark spots, & the perfect balance & texture. Just perfect smooth skin. I do believe this helps w/ some anti aging as well. I\u2019m 35 & my skin honestly looks better than it did in my late 20s. I am forever grateful for this moisturizer. As silly as that may sound. I am grateful because I was about to give up on my skincare all together before Andalou. If you\u2019re doubting trying this, please don\u2019t! You will not regret your purchase! A bonus is that there are no harsh chemicals in this moisturizer or any Andalou products! \ud83d\ude00. I am gaining absolutely nothing by leaving this review. I am just truly grateful that I discovered this & made the purchase back in 2021. I haven\u2019t used anything else since. Not only has this gotten my oily skin under control but it has evened out any dark spots & redness I had before. If you struggle w/ any of the issues I mentioned above, it is totally worth the price for this tube. This bottle lasts me about a month or so. It is a small price to pay for beautiful skin. I will also start trying out their other products as well.",

                "reviewText": "Since the days of Proactiv oil-free moisture, I have been changed-- I can no longer handle any kind of oil in my moisturizer. It makes shine, it feels greasy and I just can't handle it. For many years I used Biore oil free moisture, but they stopped making it. Since then I've been on a bit of a journey to find a replacement product, and this is one of two (from the same company) that I've been satisfied with. The texture of the product leans toward the thick side rather than watery/runny.If you visit the company's website, the product description tells a little more, describing it as clarifying and mattifying. I can agree with the latter, but haven't had it long enough to comment on the clarifying. My skin is pretty sensitive so that's yet another variable I have to consider when using an oil free moisturizer and in this case, so far, so good.I've been pleased with the value and product size, function and all aspects so far. I also like the size/shape of the container and the pump. It's just thick enough that I'm concerned about how it will continue to pump as it gets low, but we'll see.Pleased, and no concerns recommending.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this moisturizer for years. In fact, I use many of the products in this line. It's great for my sensitive, 34 year old, acne-prone skin. It's lightweight but moisturizing enough to use year-round. My partner (38 year old man) even started using it; he used to not use moisturizer because he thought it would make him look greasy. I explained to him how forgoing moisturizer actually leaves your skin dehydrated, and that dehydration leads the skin to produce more oil in an effort to alleviate the dryness. Since he started using it, he doesn't get greasy. :) So we'll both keep using this!",

                "reviewText": "I love this product! I bought it because I wanted a lotion that wouldn't make my skin look/feel oilier, and this product does the job! It feels very lightweight and gives my skin a matte-ish look/feel. The only area where this product lacks (and only very slightly) is in the moisturizing part. It does moisturize my skin, but I do feel the need to add a little of my heavy-duty moisturizer in certain parts of my face after using this. Granted, I have combination skin, so there are areas of my skin that are very dry (and I also live in the desert, so that doesn't help!). All in all, I love this product and would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a natural way to moisturize without adding to the shine.",

It makes my skin feel fresh and alive in a way that no other product ever has!My skin is all over the place - slightly oily, somewhat breakout prone, somewhat sensitive, but also moderately dehydrated, with some minor flaking. This product sinks in quickly and doesn't make me shiny, but doesn't dry my skin out like some mattifying moisturisers do. It does exactly what it says - offers light hydration.At the moment, it doesn't offer quite enough hydration for me since it's winter and my skin is dehydrated, but I imagine a hydrating serum underneath would work well. I imagine it will be perfect on its own during the summer.It's also worth mentioning that the consistency is a thin serumy white cream, not a gel. I'd definitely recommend this moisturiser as long as you don't have very dry skin!",
