It is a decent all season sunscreen too and it is great for sensitive skin. (I tolerate this very well and I rarely find products that don\u2019t cause a terrible reaction when I try something new) I don\u2019t give it a full 5 stars for a simple reason: I struggle a little with the texture. It has a bit of that cakey feeling many sunscreens leave you with. I really wish it was more lightweight.To fix that, I usually end up mixing it up with a very light serum so it blends in a bit more and that makes a big difference.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this product for almost a year and have found it a great part of my skincare routine. I originally got it because I have dry skin, and didn't like how I was seeing some aging creeping into my forehead and around my eyes. I was looking for some thing effective, but didn't make my skin looks like it had been slathered with a heavy cream. I have tried several products, and this one seems to check most of the boxes I need: it is light, it is quickly absorbed, and it definitely hydrates. The container itself is a great dispenser, allowing you to only pump a limited amount of product so you don't feel like you are wasting it. I have found, even with daily and nightly use, that a single container can last me months. Full disclaimer, I do have a beard, so I mostly use this product on my cheeks, nose, forehead, and very carefully under my eyes. I tend to apply before bed at night, or after a morning shower. Though I haven't run into this case often, I wouldn't recommend applying within a couple hours before exercising, as I have had some issue with residue running with sweat from my forehead into my eyes. I didn't think to buy this product as a sunblock, but I have been AMAZED at how well it has served me this past summer, and I have taxed it quite a bit. I tend to apply it liberally to my forehead, and then more carefully around the side of my temples and along my cheekbones being careful not to pull any skin around my eye. I rub it into my cheeks and forehead and tap it into the more delicate skin under my eyes. Then I tap over everything with my finger tips to ensure I don't have any streaks or visible residue.",

                "reviewText": "I have lighter Asian skin and am over 40. Some reviews mentioned a burning and itchiness when using. I experienced this the first few times I used this product too. But it no longer happens and truly, happened the first three or four times. I asked my dermatologist about it. It could be the retinol, if there is any retinol compounds in the lotion, which is common as the skin adjusts for some people. The burning was very mild and around the areas that get the most sun exposure and damage. It felt like a mild sun burn the first day when you hit the skin with hot water in the shower. The itching was mild too. One of those itches you get but don\u2019t totally notice is happening until you itch it the fourth time. It was also very mild and only around my chin area. Both subsided and no longer happen. My husband is caucasian and didn\u2019t experience the itching or burning at all. A rash never appeared or any other visible changes as my skin adjusted. Having said that, the lotion goes on very smoothly. I prefer this to the other Neutrogena sun block that is white and comes in a big tube. That smelled very chemically and burned when I sweat. This seems more absorbent and the smell as milder. I have been using this for several months and the areas where I had denser sunspots is actually lighter. This could be the result of many things but using this lotion is the only thing I changed in my skincare routine.",
