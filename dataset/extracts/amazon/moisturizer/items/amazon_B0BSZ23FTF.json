Well, within a day or two she took it out and gave it a try. She said it made her skin feel soft after her shower. She is using it regularly and likes it.",

It feels moisturizing and my facial skin gets aggravated with alot of facialproducts, but my skin loves this bubble moisturizer. I like how you press down to get a flower shape, but depending on how hard/soft you press it sometimes is perfect and sometimes isn't, but that isn't much of a problem for me, I just wanted to get a good moisturizer and this is exactly that, def recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I heard this moisturizer was very good and I have been suffering with very dry skin thanks to winter. I bought this and it delivered. It has helped moisturize my dry flaky face. I plan to repurchase this when it\u2019s gone. I do recommend running a humidifier by your bed at night. That also was a huge help to my skin.",
