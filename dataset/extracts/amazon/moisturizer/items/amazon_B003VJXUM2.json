                "reviewText": "I decided to buy this after reading positive reviews on MakeupAlley and Amazon. My skin is not very dry and does not require a heavyweight moisturizer. I have been using Dermalogica Intensive Moisturizer. I like that quite well but it is very expensive so I have been looking for an alternative. The Dermalogica is close to $40 for a 3.5 ounce tube. The Sukin is about $14 for a 4.25 ounce bottle. Compared to the Dermalogica the Sukin moisturizer is a little \"thinner\" but I actually like that. I was surprised that it has quite a noticeable smell -- kind of orange -- not sure whether this is a plus or a minus for me. But the moisturizer itself is very good in that it absorbs quickly, spreads easily, is not at all greasy in feeling and does not have any adverse reaction at all on my skin. I found that it can be a little difficult to control precisely how much comes out of the pump -- takes a bit of practice -- and you do not want to release too much as a little goes a long way. Then when thinking about a second bottle to take to the gym I saw that this is also sold in the same size bottle but with flip top cap top, so I bought that instead.",
