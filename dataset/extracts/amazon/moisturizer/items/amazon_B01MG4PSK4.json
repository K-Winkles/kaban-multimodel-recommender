Immediately follow with a facial moisturizer to lock in hydration After cleansing, quickly follow with CETAPHIL Daily Oil Free Hydrating Lotion with hyaluronic acid to immediately hydrate and lock in vital moisture. During the day, it is also recommended to use a facial SPF moisturizer with sun protection such as CETAPHIL Daily Moisturizer with Broad Spectrum SPF 15 to deliver nourishing hydration that locks in vital moisture and protects your skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays. Apply a moisturizer at night to help your skin rehydrate, renew and repair Skin cells do their greatest renewal and repair while you sleep at night, yet skin loses more water at night. Using a moisturizer before bed such as CETAPHIL Daily Oil-Free Hydrating Lotion with hyaluronic acid helps boost skin\u2019s moisture reserves and protect skin from dryness throughout the night so that the skin looks and feels refreshed. Complete your combination skin care routine with CETAPHIL A daily facial skin care routine with CETAPHIL cleansers and moisturizers designed for your skin type will help to leave your sensitive skin feeling refreshed and balanced.",

It's incredibly lightweight and absorbs quickly into my skin, leaving it feeling hydrated and refreshed. The addition of hyaluronic acid is a game-changer, as it provides an extra boost of moisture, making it perfect for my dry skin. What sets it apart is that it's non-greasy and doesn't clog pores, making it suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. I appreciate that it's fragrance-free and doesn't irritate my skin. It's become an essential part of my skincare routine, and I love how it keeps my face feeling soft and moisturized throughout the day. Cetaphil has once again delivered a stellar product that I highly recommend for anyone in search of a reliable daily facial moisturizer.",

I got tired of paying for other needlessly expensive options and wanted to see if I could find what I wanted at a more reasonable price. This is it.I wanted a simple, fragrance-free, oil-free moisturizer to keep my face moisturized, and I could not be happier with this. I have a skin condition which gives me a lot of problems if it gets too dry but I hate the feel of putting a bunch of goopy, slimy crap on my face. This moisturizer is very light; almost watery (as it should be because it\u2019s oil-free), and is absorbed by my skin almost immediately with no mess or gross sliminess. I\u2019ll be buying this as long as they sell it.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion for my face for several weeks now, and it has become a fundamental part of my daily skincare routine. This product stands out for its gentle formula, effective hydration, and suitability for a range of skin types, especially those with sensitive skin.One of the most impressive aspects of this lotion is its lightweight texture. Unlike many other moisturizers, it doesn't feel heavy or greasy on the skin. It absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth without any residue. This makes it ideal for use under makeup or as a standalone moisturizer.The hydration provided by Cetaphil's lotion is long-lasting and effective. Formulated with hyaluronic acid, it helps retain natural moisture, keeping my skin hydrated throughout the day. I've noticed a significant reduction in dry patches and an overall improvement in my skin's texture since I started using it.Suitable for sensitive skin, this lotion is fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and hypoallergenic. I have not experienced any irritation or breakouts, which is a common issue for me with other facial moisturizers. This reassurance makes it a go-to choice for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin.Cetaphil\u2019s commitment to simple and beneficial ingredients is evident in this product. It's free from harsh chemicals and irritants, focusing instead on elements that promote skin health and hydration.The packaging is practical and user-friendly. The pump dispenser is hygienic and dispenses just the right amount of product, minimizing waste and ensuring easy application.In terms of value, while Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion is slightly pricier than some drugstore moisturizers, its effectiveness and gentle formula justify the cost. A little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts a considerable amount of time.The only potential downside is that it may not be sufficient for extremely dry skin types, especially in harsher weather conditions. In such cases, additional moisturizing products might be necessary.In summary, Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion for Face is an excellent product for anyone seeking a gentle, effective, and non-irritating moisturizer. Its lightweight formula, combined with its hydrating and skin-friendly ingredients, makes it a suitable choice for a wide range of skin types, particularly those with sensitive skin. It offers a simple yet effective solution for daily skin hydration and care.",
