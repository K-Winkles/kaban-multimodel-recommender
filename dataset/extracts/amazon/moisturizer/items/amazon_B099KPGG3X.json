My face gets very dry in the winter, and this is the only moisturizer that has helped the dryness. The product is all natural and the smell is not strong. You only have to use a little bit and it is a very lightweight feels amazing on your face. I had friends and family purchase the DIME moisturizers and they also love them. I also use the DIME mascara and love it too. DIME has really great products and I will be purchasing more DIME products in the future. The moisturizers and their products are worth every dime.",
