        "description": "GIOVANNI D:tox System Replenishing Facial Moisturizer contains Super-antioxidants Acai & Goji Berry in combination with Activated Charcoal & Volcanic Ash to restore moisture and help prevent dryness. GIOVANNI was the first full-range, salon-inspired hair-care brand in natural product stores, and today is the #1 selling Hair Care line in the United States Natural Products Industry. But before there was a brand, there was a pioneer. Arthur Guidotti had a vision and a love for all things hair. He began developing his passion as a hairstylist in Hollywood and Beverly Hills. By the 1960s, Arthur was maturing his talents and decided to open his own salon, called On Sunset. The salon was a bustling site, on the famous Sunset Strip, and a hit with many Hollywood celebrities, including Lucille Ball. Since 1979 the GIOVANNI Rule of Balance has been our commitment to make each product as pure and as natural as possible without sacrificing exceptional product performance. GIOVANNI is committed to creating only the highest-performance formulations, wrapped in aesthetically beautiful packaging and marketed with extraordinary visuals and graphics.",

                "reviewText": "I am posting my full review of this system to each product I purchased! See below, and I hope you find this review helpful!I read a ton of reviews in searching for a new line of facial cleansing products, and settled on this as my newest attempt. I have a rather infuriating combination of skin on my face. I get large, deep bumps that tend not to come to a head on my chin (but only one or two here and there) and forehead (randomly), while also having smaller, reddish or white heads on my forehead. I have blackheads on my nose, and then recently have started waking up to small white bumps on either side of my nose. The bumps on my cheeks just beside my nose is also accompanied by a redness a lot of the time to that area of the skin. I have ruled out rosacea with my doctor. My skin is also relatively sensitive to moisturizers, and often to exfoliating scrubs, which can be annoying since my forehead also gets dry and sometimes flaky. So there's what I was dealing with.I bought the D:tox Purifying Facial Cleanser, the Purifying Facial Scrub, the System Replenishing Facial Moisturizer, and the Purifying Facial Mask. I have now been using the system for just over three weeks, and here is what I think:Cleanser: I absolutely love it. It's not overly scented, though it does smell pleasant, it's mostly a clean smell. It's a thick liquid, but not too thick. I note that it doesn't stick to the bottle too much, and doesn't leave any sort of residue on it as I deplete the bottle, which I think is noteworthy. The empty plastic at the top of the bottle is crystal clear. It doesn't foam a lot, but it doesn't need to. After washing my face with this (I was twice daily, in the morning and at night) my skin feels calm, the redness is reduced visibly, and my skin doesn't get inflamed. I really love using this wash. I really love that there are no harsh chemicals like salicylic acid and it still is clearing up my acne without attacking the other parts of my skin. I think this cleanser, while solving my acne problems, would also be a wonderful daily wash for folks that do not have acne. It's clean and fresh and gentle.Scrub: For the first 2.5 weeks, I used this every time I washed my face. I am actually quite impressed with it. This isn't like some products that have the visible microbeads, it's almost like a fine, smooth sand is mixed in with an opaque cream. It doesn't really have much of a scent to it. Like the cleanser, it smells clean. I mentioned my skin has issues with scrubs sometimes. In past attempts at using other skin care systems, I will often reduce the number of times I use a scrub even more significantly than they will suggest, because it will irritate my skin if used to frequently. I don't like removing scrubs entirely, however, because the exfoliation leaves my skin looking brighter, and pulls that dead skin that causes grossness from certain areas. This scrub is so gentle. I very gently scrub in circular motions all over my face and the results are obvious. My skin feels softer, and I have no more flaking at all ever! This is also the work of the moisturizer, but I'll get to that in a moment. I have in the last week, started to experiment with only using this every other day, and will update my review after I've done this for a bit longer.Moisturizer: I have to tell you, regardless of the system, I have gone through so. many. moisturizers. I have tried vegan ones, unscented ones, oil free ones, combo skin, and on and one. I struggle most with this because of the range of need on my face. My forehead is oily, but the skin also gets dry and flaky sometimes. My nose is constantly oily, and my cheeks and chin tend to be pretty normal. I've used moisturizer combinations on different parts of my face and just nothing has ever been quite as great as this stuff. I mean, I'm in love with the moisturizer. I use a good almost nickel sized bit and rub it in my hands and all over my face and neck. It was off-putting to me at first, because it seemed a tad on the greasy side when I got it applied, however, after thoroughly massaging it in, after a few minutes it absorbs and doesn't feel heavy at all. It's creamy and luxurious and the difference it has made to evening my skin has been completely awesome. I no longer get dry flakiness, and my nose is getting the proper level of moisture so it's not overly producing oil anymore. I cannot say enough good things about this stuff!Mask: I use the mask 2-3 times per week. I apply a thin layer all over my face while dry and then leave it for 20 minutes while I fold clothes and watch Netflix. I usually use it after the scrub, but before moisturizing. It drys completely but doesn't flake off. It's a thick cream and, like the other products, is lightly scented but only to smell clean and earthy. After rinsing, my skin feels like it's had oil and impurities sucked out of it, without overly drying out my face. It's especially satisfying to apply the moisturizer after the mask.Summary: This is an excellent system for mild to moderate acne, but my opinion is that this is also a great product for those looking for a cleaning system or product without acne. Depending on your needs, just parts of the system will work for you. It's a great product for sensitive skin, and incredibly affordable compared to other systems. I recommend this highly!",

Mais elle a tous les extraits de plantes antioxydantes qui promettent l'efficacit\u00e9 sur le long terme. Cela fait 3 ans que je n'ach\u00e8te que \u00e7a et elle semble faire son effet. Tout d'abord, c'est une cr\u00e8me hydratante avec une bonne texture qui p\u00e9n\u00e8tre rapidement. Apr\u00e8s, pour l'aspect antiride, anti\u00e2ge et tout le blabla marketing, je vous dirais qu'elle ne fait pas de mal et qu'il est possible qu'elle ait un \u00e9ventuel effet. Mais l'aspect hydratant fonctionne tr\u00e8s bien.Quand on a une ride, il est trop tard, le r\u00f4le de la cr\u00e8me est d\u2019\u00e9viter l'apparition des autres ridules. Donc, il faut s'y prendre t\u00f4t, en pr\u00e9vention. La cr\u00e8me est vite absorb\u00e9e par la peau, elle laisse un film tr\u00e8s l\u00e9ger qui s'efface tr\u00e8s vite en frottant apr\u00e8s 5 minutes. Elle gonfle la ridule et semble \u00e9viter l'apparition d'autres rides (en tout cas, elle semble ralentir le processus sur ma peau), c'est le premier r\u00f4le d'une bonne cr\u00e8me hydratante.Enfin, elle n'a aucun parfum, et \u00e7a, c'est important pour moi. Son prix est excellent au regard de la grande quantit\u00e9. Bref, c'est un bon plan.",
