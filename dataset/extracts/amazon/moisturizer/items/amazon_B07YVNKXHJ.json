Dry skin & large pores around the cheek area and this product is very smooth & hydrating & doesn't weigh down my large pores like other products do. It does leave my skin looking rejuvenated and soft like the hydration is coming from within the skin, not a layer of moisturizer. I've also tried the Paula's Choice Omega+ Complex Lightweight Face Moisturizer but that one is not as lightweight and it has a thicker consistency, where as this one feels a lot more smoother and watery, better suited for my skin.",

I use it more sparingly in the summer and mix it with a vitamin c sunscreen and a bb cream but this time of year I use it with full force. I only wish they made one for the body (in winter months Cerave SA is my go to but I have to make sure it doesn't get on my face).The only negative thing is the amount you get for the price.

                "reviewText": "Skin care reviews are tricky because everyone has their own likes/dislikes. But for me, this is a 5 star moisturizer. I have used PC for years. Most products I like. Some I don't care for. This one I love and would definitely buy again. Great consistency, texture, no fragrance, great packaging, squeezes out of tube in perfect amount. There is nothing I don't like about this product. Thanks again Paula!",
