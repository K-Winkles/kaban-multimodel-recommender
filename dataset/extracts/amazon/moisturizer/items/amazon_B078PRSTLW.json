I\u2019ve been using it about a week now and I am very happy with this product. And you don\u2019t need to wait a week for results\u2026it provided excellent results with the very first use! It also has a really nice scent (not a strong, overwhelming scent either). At first I didn\u2019t think I would like it because it stayed white on my skin even as I rubbed it in, but then I realized you just have to wait 2 minutes or so and the product absorbs nicely into the skin leaving a soft and radiant look! Very happy with this face moisturizer and I plan to purchase it again. Another great product from Brickell!",

And they are reasonably priced and less than other \"high-end\" brands.This Daily Face Moisturizer is the best I have ever used. I tend to have dry skin and have used innumerable face lotion brands and types. But once I found this lotion my search was over. This lotion not only smells great, it spreads evenly and smoothly with just a little bit of lotion. It goes a long way and keeps my face from drying out for most of the day which is a miracle.Give it a try, you won't regret it.",

                "reviewText": "So, I've been using this moisturizer for men for a few weeks now, and I gotta say, I'm pretty happy with it. It's got a nice texture that doesn't feel too heavy or greasy on my skin, and I appreciate that it doesn't have a strong scent.I really like how quickly it absorbs into my skin too. It doesn't leave any weird residue or stickiness, which makes it easy to use both in the morning and before bed. And I've definitely noticed an improvement in my skin's texture and appearance since I started using it.Now, I will say that if you've got really dry or rough skin, this might not be the best option for you. But for me, it's been working really well. It's not the most heavy-duty moisturizer out there, but it gets the job done.Overall, I think this is a solid choice if you're in the market for a new moisturizer. It's simple, effective, and doesn't have any annoying fragrances. So if you're a guy like me who just wants a moisturizer that works, give this one a shot.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve tried multiple moisturisers over the past few years and always return to this product. I\u2019m in my early 40\u2019s and whilst searching for new products I realised I had combination skin (oily/dry). I have purchased other brands to try alongside the Brickell Moisturiser but I always pass these on to family and friends. The moisturiser is more like a lotion which is great because it\u2019s light and absorbs into my skin without leaving any residue or stickiness and you only have to apply a small amount which is a bonus. I only apply the moisturiser once a day after I\u2019ve showered and my skin feels hydrated, oil-free and without any shine that I seem to get later in the afternoon with other products I\u2019ve tried. I always purchase the scented moisturiser because I like the refreshing minty eucalyptus smell, however, I\u2019m not sure if this would be to everyone's liking. The moisturiser isn\u2019t the cheapest hence my reason for trying other products but sometimes you get what you pay for. I think the packaging could look a little more high-end due to the price point, but this is only a very small criticism.This product now forms part of my daily routine alongside other products from the Brickell\u2019s range, I would definitely recommend this product if you\u2019re having difficulties finding the correct daily moisturiser like I did.",

Vom ersten Tag an, an dem ich sie benutzt habe, war ich absolut begeistert.Ich trage die Creme jeden Morgen nach dem Aufstehen und auch nach dem Rasieren auf. Der Effekt ist einfach fantastisch! Meine Haut f\u00fchlt sich viel besser an und ist irgendwie straffer geworden. Ich merke f\u00f6rmlich, wie sie mit Feuchtigkeit versorgt wird und sich regeneriert. Das hat nicht nur mir selbst auffallen k\u00f6nnen, sondern auch meinen Kollegen. Sie haben mir sogar gesagt, dass ich frischer aussehe!Die Konsistenz der Creme ist angenehm und sie zieht schnell in die Haut ein, ohne einen fettigen R\u00fcckstand zu hinterlassen. Der dezente Duft ist ebenfalls ein Pluspunkt f\u00fcr mich, da er nicht aufdringlich ist und gut zur M\u00e4nnlichkeit passt.Ich bin wirklich froh, diese Feuchtigkeitscreme entdeckt zu haben. Sie hat meine Erwartungen \u00fcbertroffen und ich kann sie uneingeschr\u00e4nkt empfehlen. Wenn Sie nach einer hochwertigen Pflege f\u00fcr M\u00e4nner suchen, die Ihrer Haut ein ges\u00fcnderes und frischeres Aussehen verleiht, dann sollten Sie definitiv diese Feuchtigkeitscreme ausprobieren!",
