While the bumps/ingrown hair can be more stubborn on lower legs, this lotion has done what numerous other brands' lotions failed to do: my arms feel silky and baby soft like rest of my body!!!!! Yes, the scent is strong, but I really do not give a damn because it REALLY WORKS. It moisturizes skin from its core (instead of just on the surface like 99% lotions in the market) and my body skin thanks it. If you can't use anything with mineral oil (it causes body acne on some people) and can stand the strong scent (which doesn't last more than 2 hours), please do your skin a favor and try it. You will not regret.",

After living in the desert for 6 years my skin gets super dry whether it\u2019s the summer or winter and whatever \u201cseasons\u201d we get in between! This has a softly delicate scent of coconut. Which isn\u2019t overpowering because coconut scent usually makes me nauseous! It\u2019s more of a milky consistency so I tend to shake it before I use it. I absolute am addicted to using this after every shower. If I don\u2019t use it for a day or two my skin is still soft and hydrated. I was so glad that when I moved back home after my summer away that I could order this product on amazing.",
