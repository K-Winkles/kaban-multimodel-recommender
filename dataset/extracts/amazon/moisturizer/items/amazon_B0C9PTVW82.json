                "reviewText": "I actually bought this cream a few months ago. I used all the cream and for someone who is looking for a cream to keep my skin hydrated in the hot dessert heat; this is the cream. One of the things that I liked about this cream is that a little cream goes a long way. It absorbs into my skin well, which I appreciated because I am someone who doesn\u2019t really wear makeup. I just don\u2019t like how some products feel heavy on my face throughout the day. This moisturizer had no feeling of it being too much. Like I mentioned before\u2026a little goes a long way. I did make the mistake the first time of using too much and it did feel heavy, but with less it was a perfect feeling on my face. Planning to repurchase, and also planning to try out the aqua gel version as well.",

It doesn\u2019t contain any scent so it won\u2019t irritate your skin. The cream is pretty thick and creamy but not heavy. You don\u2019t need much as it applies smoothly. It\u2019s light weight. My skin feels very moisturized and comfortable throughout the day. I also like that it doesn\u2019t make my skin oily. Overall, I really enjoy this cream.",

This is a great barrier cream for using with strong dermal medications, to lessen the harshness they have on my face and neck. I also use it as a final layer after applying all my serums and moisturizer products at night. It is like having a cream based Vaseline. I can also use it with my foundation and concealer.",
