It immediately hydrates (use just a little), does not clog my pores, in fact shrinks my pores; there is no scent, I don\u2019t have itchy skin, no break-outs, no irritation of any kind. I apply it as the last part of my facial regime first thing in the morning & just before I go to bed. I love it. I\u2019m a senior & have a few facial moles/growths, tags, two small areas of discoloration & two surgical scars. I treat those problem areas individually with another ointment & after 45 min. apply this moisturizer. The scars have softened, not as pronounced. I see a great difference in my skin & a few friends have commented on how smooth, fresh & nice my skin looks. I am so happy to have found this healthy beauty product.",

I think in the summer though it will be great day and night. It miiiight be a little heavy in the day for summer with the humidity but idk we will see. I\u2019m sure it will be fine. I just came to say that I Looooove this moisturizer and have purchased it a couple times now and will continue to purchase it. I\u2019ve been getting the package that comes with 2 bottles. It\u2019s a better deal. Get it!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to try out the product before committing to buying the full-sized products. The foaming cleanser is great and is unscented ( great for sensitive skin! It also takes off makeup). The toner is very hydrating and lightweight. The cream triggered my fungal acne so I had a mountain range on my forehead for a little bit, but I will have to see if I just need to use less. I am used to using a lot of cream for my dry skin, so it could be a user error on my part. Overall I would buy the full-sized products when I run out of these ( except the cream)",

                "reviewText": "As the owner of skin that is both dry + acne-prone, I require a moisturizer that does NOT\u2026- clog my pores- require reapplication between my AM & PM routines- sting if my skin is sensitized\u2026I\u2019m not asking for much, right?!Well, if you\u2019re reading this review, you probably know that basically every moisturizer has some fatal flaw \u2014 too greasy, not moisturizing enough, hydrating but not occlusive, overpoweringly scented, breakout-inducing, stingy, prohibitively expensive, texturally gross, etc.I research all skincare products via incidecoder.com to check for irritating/comedogenic/red-flag ingredients so I can decide based on the chemical info provided whether a product is even compatible with my skin type before I buy & try.Enter Soon Jung 2x Barrier Cream: I was kinda stunned when I finally stumbled on this after a ridiculous amount of trial & error.Effectively & chemically, it\u2019s a great product, especially for those of you with dry, acne-prone, and/or sensitive skin.Not only did it pass my INCI test with flying colors, but it actually follows through on its claims in practice.Whew! It\u2019s really no wonder so many people rave about it.Here are all the boxes it ticks, and more:- Actually non-comedogenic; very unlikely to cause breakouts- Non-irritating; doesn\u2019t sting at all, even on accidentally-over-exfoliated skin. This is extra important for me since I\u2019m about to start a Tretinoin + Azelaic Acid formula.- Relatively short & simple ingredient list with quite a few powerhouse \u201cgoodies\u201d- Fragrance-free and no notable scent. If you have a very sensitive nose, you might detect a very diluted/distant \u201cunscented lotion\u201d smell.- Inexpensive & worth it. The tube is not huge, but knowing the other moisturizers out there, I would still buy this at double the cost.- Actually moisturizing; I only have to apply it once in my AM routine and once in the PM (taking my other hydrating & drying products into account)- It\u2019s packaged in a hygienic tube (pots get contaminated easily from touching the contents). The tube is also kinda fun since it comes out in a lil ring!- It has a very luxurious & smooth texture; it\u2019s easy to spread on, no pulling or pilling, even over other products (layers nicely. I rarely wear makeup so I can\u2019t speak to how it works under foundation)- It\u2019s breathable/not claustrophobic-feeling (maybe it\u2019s just me who gets this from some barrier creams or thicker lotions)- Lightweight enough for daytime use if your skin is on the drier sidePic: screenshot of the INCI Decoder chart for this specific cream (note: ingredients rated on a 0-5 scale & listed together: e.g. 0 out of 5/no irritation potential, 1 out of 5/very low comedogenic potential = \u201c0,1\u201d).TL/DR: If you have dry skin, getting this moisturizer now will save you so much time & money, and there\u2019s nothing to lose, as the ingredients are highly unlikely compromise your skin in any way (unless you are the victim of a very obscure allergy).",

                "reviewText": "I have very sensitive and oily skin, however, due to the active products I use I do experience dry patches and small breakouts in those areas. This product is so lightweight yet so moisturizing, the first time I used this product I used a pea-sized amount and that was more than enough. It goes on quite greasy, but settles into the skin nicely. For those with oily skin I would not recommend using this as an AM moisturizer as it does leave shine. But great to use before bed, I wake up and my skin still feels and looks hydrated. The bottle is way smaller than I expected, like the size of a small hand lotion tube. However, you barely need any product so I can see this lasting me a couple of months.",
