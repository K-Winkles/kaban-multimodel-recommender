                "reviewText": "This is a lovely oil -- I chose the revitalizing body oil which is a light-weight but rich feeling oil that goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly. It has a luxurious feel and leaves a slight sheen on my skin but it doesn't have an oily look or feel. I apply it after my shower when my skin is still damp. My skin feels very soft, smooth and supple and the effects last all day. It is also great to use on my dry, rough hands after doing household chores or working in my garden and it really helps keep them nice (cuticles and nails, too). The oil has a light herbal scent that I really like; it is rather subtle and doesn't linger very long. There is no added fragrance, just the scent from the ingredients: organic oils (thyme, soybean, olive and sunflower) + tocopherol, alkanes, geraniol, limonene and linolool. The current price of $41.00 seems reasonable for this luxe, well formulated oil -- it is made in France and the quality is excellent. The oil is housed in a nice, heavy glass bottle with an orifice reducer under the cap to control how much of the product is dispensed and prevent waste. The oil arrived boxed and sealed.",

As you can see in the video, this oil leaves a slight sheen to your skin.Wonderful to put on while your skin is still wet from bathing, right before you pat yourself dry with a luxurious Turkish towel.Leaves your skin soft and silky. I believe this would be fine for any gender. Not a lot of fragrance to it, and another big plus is that the precious oil in this glass bottle, is organic.Crafted in France.Excellent product, highly recommended.",
