This whole thing seemed sort of fishy... the containers are trial size and had big black marks across the UPC codes on the bottom. They also were not sealed in anyway. Lastly the return address sender name was from Captain Mouse... the whole thing just seemed off to me. Having said all that this particular moisturizer is really great for sensitive skin that breaks out easily and also for skin that isn't super dry. Just don't buy it from this seller!",
