Fortunately, I stumbled upon Belif The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb, and it has been nothing short of a revelation for my skin. This is my second time buying it, and I can confidently say it's a game-changer.I apply this moisturizing bomb twice a day, and the results have been truly astonishing. My introduction to this product came from a recommendation by an esthetician, and I owe them a huge debt of gratitude. From the moment I started using it, my skin's condition improved dramatically.The texture of The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb is rich and luxurious, and it feels incredibly soothing as I apply it. It's like a drink of water for my skin, and it instantly relieves the tightness and discomfort of dryness. It doesn't leave a greasy residue, which is a common issue I've had with other moisturizers, making it perfect for both my morning and evening routines.One of the standout features of this product is its long-lasting hydration. Even in the driest of weather, I've found that my skin stays moisturized throughout the day. I no longer have to worry about that uncomfortable midday flakiness or the need for frequent touch-ups.Not only does it provide intensive hydration, but it also helps to improve the overall health of my skin. Over time, I've noticed that my complexion has become smoother, more radiant, and less prone to irritation. This moisturizer has become an essential part of my skincare routine, and I can't imagine going without it.Belif The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb is worth every penny, and I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with dry skin. It has proven to be a reliable and effective solution that has earned its place as a staple in my skincare regimen. If you want to experience the relief and transformation that I have, give this product a try \u2013 you won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "this moisturizer is a lifesaver. i\u2019ve never had anything that was so powerful. a couple months ago, my skin became extremely dry and my normal moisturizers weren\u2019t enough and my skin was peeling. i had a sample of this that i got from sephora and it was great. once i ran out, i ordered this bigger size and i couldn\u2019t be happier! i would put a decent amount of this moisturizer on at night and within a few days my skin was restored. there is no scent that i can point out. it also isn\u2019t as greasy as some heavy moisturizers are and didn\u2019t cause any breakouts, which did happen a little bit with another i tried before this. that\u2019s another thing - this is a heavy duty moisturizer, which is why i used it at night. if your skin is really dry or you don\u2019t put it on as generously, this may work as a daytime moisturizer as well. it absorbs into the skin quickly and doesn\u2019t feel icky. i also imagine this would be GREAT for use under makeup and give you the best chance of smooth application. i eventually switched back to my regular nighttime moisturizer once the cold months came (and conveniently as the pot was about to run out), so now i use what\u2019s left of it for any dry spots that come up. a little goes a long way in this case especially, so i would say the value for the money is amazing as well!",

It's very moisturizing and both I and my daughter can use it. My skin is very dry and sensitive due to retinol use and my daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin and it's very hard to find a moisturizer that doesn't burn when applied. This stuff is extremely moisturizing and does not burn at all. I'm a lifelong customer now.",
