Every time I find a face moisturizer it breaks me out like crazy and clogs my extra oily pores even more than they are. I use all desert essence products and I LOVE them soI figured I\u2019d give this one a try too. The first time I used it my face did have a reaction to the Lye. Don\u2019t worry- it went away within fifteen minutes and after a few weeks of using it my skin adjusted and now it\u2019s clearer than ever. I FINALLY found a face cream that moisturizes my face without making it oily. This works as a great primer too. Love that this is a vegan product not tested on animals - the whole line of skin care is wonderful especially for those like me who have extremely oily skin.",

                "reviewText": "I love this stuff! I won't rehash all the details, but in addition to the info listed on the packaging/in the description, I like that it doesn't contain silicone. It's not that silicone is bad for my skin, but it doesn't do much in a moisturizer besides add slip for cheaper than using more oils and fatty acids, which provide their own slip. It says it's scented with natural geranium essential oil, but don't worry if you can't stand the smell of geraniums. It's a quite mild, faint, almost brown sugar smell. It's not the odor of the stalks and leaves. It is so faint that if they didn't tell me it was scented on purpose, I would just think it was unscented. It's a decent size jar for the price, much cheaper than other face creams I've used. I used to use the Welleda baby face lotion with calendula, but it's so greasy compared to this. The Desert Essence is light and sinks right into the skin, without leaving a sticky residue or coating of oil. I use it at night and in the morning, after I wash my face. I will continue to use this until they stop making it or change the formula drastically.",

                "reviewText": "When I first found this product I thought it was a great deal for the price... but I soon found out that I got what I paid for with this one. At first, my complaints weren't that major: it would get in my eyebrows and make them feel gross and it also wouldn't fully moisturizer my t-zone no matter how many layers I would do (I have combo skin where I am oily in my t-zone and normal everywhere else and I am also acne/blackhead prone).Then the real horror happened. I use chemical exfoliants (both BHA and AHA) and have been for years without any issue. I had even been using them with this moisturizer for nearly 3 weeks with no issue. But one day the moisturizer reacted horribly with my exfoliants and gave me what felt and looked like a horrible sun burn. It stung for about 2 minutes and my face looked horribly red all over!I thought I might of been my exfoliants because the moisturizer doesn't react like that when I don't use them but I tried them with a new moisturizer and there was no problem at all.So this could work for you if maybe you have dry or normal skin and don't use chemical exfoliants. Even then, I would say it's a gamble.",

I loved that it made my skin feel soft but I developed little bumps on my face that weren\u2019t visible and didn\u2019t hurt but we\u2019re spreading along my face. I do have sensitive skin though and this just didn\u2019t agree with it. I did like the texture and that it easily absorbed into my face leaving it soft and smooth with no residue at all. My only negative comment is that it doesn\u2019t smell so nice in my opinion. I know it\u2019s a safe product so I\u2019m bummed it did not work for me. All skin is different and it\u2019s worth a try to find a safe product that the EWG rates as safe. Just didn\u2019t work for me so I\u2019ll have to go back to my Cetaphil for now.",
