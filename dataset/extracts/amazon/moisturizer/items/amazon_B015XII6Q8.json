                "reviewText": "I have really dry skin so I need an ultra deep moisturizer at night so that I wake up with plump skin in the morning. Not many moisturizers keep my skin hydrated over night. My makeup is patchy in the morning if I use the wrong moisturizer\u2026 but this stuff? It\u2019s amazing. I put it on when I get out of the shower at night (you also don\u2019t need much because it\u2019s rich and thick!) and it instantly sinks into my skin but at the same time stays on my skin ALL NIGHT and keeps my face super moisturized. Before using this product, I was getting super frustrated waking up in the morning to do my foundation and dealing with cakey patches or my makeup separating because my face was a little too dry. But not anymore!!!! This hydrates my skin so nicely and I wake up looking refreshed, hydrated and plumped. And the price is just wonderful, so I will keep buying this over and over to use as my nightly moisturizer! It has also not irritated my skin or caused me to break out. It\u2019s a holy grail product for me.",

My 2024 new years resolution was to stop that an love myself more so i came to Amazon to hunt for products. Its overwhelming!! Im good with cleansers masks an scrubs an specifically was looking for moisturizer and a retinol serum. I chose this ELF moisturizer because of its high reviews , small size and low price point. Sux wasting money on things that stink or are oily or make me break out. Firstly i love the container. Its cute an i like how it feels. Silly i know but ive stopped using products over the years cuz of sucky annoying packaging LOL im hoping they offer larger sizes to save money. I mite even squirt it into this container if so. Next...smell...im super sensitive to certain scents . like i can smell ear wax if someones ears are dirty YUK! LOL I am happy to report i can smell NOTHING. Just like when i had covid lol. It sinks right in nicely too an my face feels baby soft!! I think im not used to having hydrated skin cuz i keep sweating an feel heated....could be a hot flash tho lol ANYWAYS its not greasy. No residue. An love how smooth my skin is. Im excited to try ELF out for my next forray into a skin care regime!! A++++",
