                "reviewText": "I've tried my fair share of moisturizers, but Farmacy's Halo Ceramide Face Moisturizer Cream is truly a game-changer. It's become my go-to daily moisturizer, and here's why:Firstly, the texture is sublime. It's incredibly creamy but not heavy, and it melts into my skin effortlessly. A little goes a long way, so the jar lasts for a good amount of time.But what truly sets this moisturizer apart is the way it leaves my skin feeling. My face is noticeably softer and smoother after just a few uses. The ceramides in this cream work wonders for my skin's hydration, and I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's barrier function. It feels more resilient and protected from environmental stressors.Another plus is that it doesn't leave any greasy residue. I can apply makeup on top of it without any issues. Plus, it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin or cause breakouts, which is a big win in my book.The scent is mild and pleasant, and I appreciate that it doesn't overpower my skincare routine.Highly recommended!",

A tiny bit went a long way in the summer but now it\u2019s winter so I\u2019m using much more product. But this is not a bad thing because I\u2019m simply using it all over my face now instead of only around the eye area. It still lasts a good long while because I don\u2019t need to slather it on. It also hasn\u2019t clogged any pores, which usually happens when I try thicker products. I remember it worked super fast in the summer to make my eye area stop getting flaky and dry. Tip: this product usually participates in sales like Prime Days and Black Friday so that\u2019s when I stock up.",

Seriously you don\u2019t.Slight subtle hint of honey. No chemical smell.Glides on perfect, and doesn\u2019t interfere with make up on top.It\u2019s one of the far better creams I\u2019ve tried.
