A friend of mine recommended this one and I am fascinated with its hydrating properties that leaves the skin feeling incredibly soft and bright.I have a dried skin and it works really well. The addition of hyaluronic acid boost the skin's natural moisture barrier and you can notice it since the first time of use.I've been using it for while now and you can visibly see its effectiveness in plumping fine lines and wrinkles. pretty sure there's more options out there but this cream has been a game changer for me. Good option for those starting a skin care routine.",

                "reviewText": "LOVE LOVE LOVE! This moisturizer is amazing. I suffered from acne in high school. After using proactiv and realizing that the product was only good in the beginning, I moved on to the murad brand. It helped miraculously. It not only stopped my acne but I haven't needed to use a regime in so long. I just learned how to cleaned my face the natural way now thoroughly to prevent any future acne. The only issue I had since I stopped using a regimen was finding a moisturizer since my face ended up feeling dry and eventually developed some dry patches from not finding a moisturizer fast enough. Then I thought, hey why not look into the murad line and see what I can find there since that matched perfectly with my sensitive skin. The way I shop, I base my decision on buying a product through reviews and several of them from different sites so I can make a confident decision. I trusted the reviews and now I'm returning the favor and writing my very own to help those who are also looking for that perfect moisturizer.I have very oily skin and this manages to keep that balanced. Of course you wouldn't want a moisturizer that keeps your face matte, obviously that only means its not doing its job. It will give you that fresh dewy look without it getting worst. My skin actually looks better with the moisturizer than not wearing it at all. Somehow it looks more oilier to me if I don't wear it. Odd huh? Without a weeks usage, my patches disappeared and my face started to have that natural glow that hydrated skins have. The product is perfectly thick yet weightless on your face. It keeps your face moisturized for the whole day. If you ever have dry cracks or anything severely dry, this will cure it without looking nasty or feeling nasty. It's become a MUST to have with me or else my life wouldn't be complete. A little goes a long way so this lasts me about 6 months or so until I need to buy another one. This moisturizer is the best friend of your foundation/make up. It's the best base yet. I have a matte foundation when the day comes that I need a matte face for an occasion since I'm not the type to touch up on my make up. From the first hour of putting on make up to the very minute of taking it off, this moisturizer did not \"oil it up.\" My foundation would keep its promise of being matte until I wash it off. Of course, I use a primer as well. And yes, you guessed it right, I use the murad primer before my foundation and it does its job.I highly recommend this product. I personally love it and will always re-order from amazon coz the murad website is just overly priced.",

                "reviewText": "This is a lovely cream which works really well. When I was on holiday for two weeks, I completely neglected my skin, and so, when I got home it was looking quite flaky and dull. Luckily, I had this moisturising cream waiting for me to try. Within just a couple of days my skin felt restored to its pre-holiday look and feel, which of course I am very pleased about. I did a little bit of investigation into the Murad brand, and it seems from the reviews that most people are very pleased with their purchases. So, as a result of my own experience with this moisturiser and those reviews I have ordered a Murad Resurgence starter kit from Amazon for \u00a325.This moisturiser is extremely expensive, but if the results are good and noticeable, then that eases the pain somewhat. A little of this cream goes a very long way, so it should last a long time too. I am generally quite sceptical regarding the claims of sincere manufacturers, but this one could be different, and actually worth its price.",

In use, my girlfriend who has better insight into such products, rated it very highly, but questioned whether it was worth the extra over her current brand. Better? Perhaps. Twice as good? Definitely not\u2026So the conclusion seems to be, high quality, but expensive.",
