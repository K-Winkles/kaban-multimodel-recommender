I\u2019ve tried every moisturizer marketed as \u201cgentle\u201d or \u201cfor sensitive skin\u201d-from cheap stuff you can find at a drug store and many people swear by, to ridiculously expensive stuff celebs endorse and NONE of them work for me. My skin will burn, turn red, I\u2019ll get breakouts, scaly patches etc. This is the only one that does not do any of that. I\u2019ve even learned that if I use this as a base layer, I can try other products with active ingredients my skin can\u2019t tolerate normally. I ran out recently and used another brand for a few days while I waited on a delayed delivery and my skin hurts. I don\u2019t know what magic Avene has that others don\u2019t, but I hope they never ever change their formula.As far as everything else-it\u2019s not the most moisturizing in the winter, I layer on some extra stuff then; it\u2019s not greasy, soaks in nicely; it won\u2019t make you look 10 years younger. But if you have hypersensitive skin, give it a try.",

My skin was drying more than usual while in the mountains during winter and within 1-2 days of use, my skin became moisturize and glowing. I live in the caribbean and I continue to use it. My face has never been this smooth & hydrated in years. I was super excited to find it on Amazon! Useful tip: it's a very small tube BUT you only need to apply a small amount, and it can last you 3 months if used daily.",
