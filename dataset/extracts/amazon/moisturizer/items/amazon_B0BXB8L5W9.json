Like I bought all I could find!This is very similar but I feel like the scent is not as strong in a good way. It\u2019s way less \u201coverpowering\u201d.The lotion is light weight non greasyHighly recommend. I use this lotion as well",

Feels nice on the skin however is not as thick as expected. There are some better shae butters on the market. But for the price, I will take it!",
