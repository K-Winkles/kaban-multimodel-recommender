                "reviewText": "I can't pretend that I understand the cosmetics market in any way--everyone has different ingredients, many with slightly nuanced versions of slightly better or worse moisturizers for slightly differing types of skin or whatever. And the scents? Oh man, some are pleasantly light, and others are like gargling with old spice deodorant while slapping yourself with leather bound birch branches. Overwhelming and unnecessary. My demands from cosmetics are mainly that it doesn't tick me off while trying to do its job.What I love about this product is that is truly is scent free, goes on easy and \"sheer,\" is super lightweight, and I don't feel like some kind of Hollywood a-hole for trying to moisturize my skin a little after a shower and shave with this stuff. I'm just a regular dude, getting just a little older, who likes to be clean and shaven, and this stuff seems to work well. No hassle, no stink, no gritty or slimy feeling.I can't tell you if pure hyloronic acid, or jojo oil, or buttermilk is better in some way that I just haven't researched enough on; what I can tell you is that it works well and I don't mind using it everyday/every time I shave.I am mainly reviewing this, as I buy it yet again, to remind myself that this is the one I tried and liked way more than a few of the other similar options.",
