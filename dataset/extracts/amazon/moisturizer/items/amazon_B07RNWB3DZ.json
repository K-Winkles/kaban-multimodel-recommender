I've tried a few gel moisturizers and had overall good experiences. Some are lighter weight and best used under sunscreen but not at night alone. Others can function as a standalone moisturizer. My fave before now was the missha water full gel cream but I can't find it anymore and it's a bit more expensive. The reason I liked it so much was that it truly HYDRATED my skin, like a cream moisturizer. Not just add a little moisture then feel dry after a few hours. This cosrx moisturizer is the closest I've found to it and it's much more affordable.The consistency is a light gel. Goes on smooth and absorbs after rubbing in. Doesn't leave a filmy heavy feel. But it keeps skin hydrated all day (I use it under my sunscreen during the day) I even use it as a night time moisturizer in the summer and I think I'll be able to continue through the winter! Plus it doesn't break me out. No noticable smell. Can't recommend this enough!",

It is super lightweight so if you have dry skin you could pair this with another moisturizer. I can't speak to its results on skin texture or anything because I have started a whole new skincare routine with several new products so it's difficult to tell what is helping and what isn't, but this moisturizer passes the cosdna.com test (all of the ingredients are safe and do not block pores/cause acne) and I haven't experienced any negative effects from it. I love the gel consistency, it feels like it absorbs fully without much residue left on the skin.",

My face feels so refreshed and with other moisturizer I look like a shiny grease-ball within two hours but NOT with this moisturizer. I am matte for the most part.

                "reviewText": "I tried to make this work during the winter but I was getting dry patches and literally started peeling. After a week I had to buy a different moisturizer to replace it. It could work well for the summer so I will hold onto it, because it didn't break me out and I have sensitive acne prone skin, and it feels great on the skin, so I'm hoping it will be perfect for hot months!",
