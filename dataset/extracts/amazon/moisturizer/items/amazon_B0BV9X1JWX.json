I use this product as a night cream, it applies as a cool gel moisturizer, as you spread it, it kinda melts into your skin! (It\u2019s kind of a Lux experience haha) It has a slight fragrance, but it\u2019s almost so light you can\u2019t rlly smell it. If I\u2019m not mistaken, cica is good for redness and inflammation\u2026 anytime I use it, I see a pretty decent reduction of redness. Im also a huge fan of the glass skin look it gives off!!! It hasn\u2019t caused me to break out, but ik everyone\u2019s skin type is different. I genuinely love it and now it\u2019s a product I use everyday!!! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

But after moving to different climates I started noticing my skin a little drier than normal, so I bought this one on sale and it has been an amazing product! It is gentle on my sensitive skin and softly moisturizing, it makes my skin feel soft and clean and it\u2019s a great texture. The best adjective I can come up with for this product is refreshing. The packaging is also a great texture and weight and one of my favorite colors so I love having it out on my sink, and I use it almost daily!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using the meebak cica cream over the last one year. In general, compared to other products, it's cheaper and good quality.With the summer approaching, my skin is getting too dry, so I was looking for something lighter , hydrated, and gel type, once I used it every morning and night for a week straight, the dryness started to fade away, and my skin started to look brighter. I immediately noticed the dry skin was now looking moisturized.It\u2019s a perfect bouncy gel that\u2019s not too creamy and not too watery. It gets absorbed immediately and firms up the skin. I\u2019m so pleased to find out a perfect daily gel for my dry skin.",

                "reviewText": "I've explored many water-based moisturizers, but Cica stands out as the best. While alternatives like Belief feel too expensive and watery, Cica delivers on its promise of being genuinely water-based without compromising texture. What I appreciate most is the subtle and light fragrance, reminiscent of Neroli or Bergamot. It's not just refreshing on the skin but also effective in calming redness. If you're looking for quality without breaking the bank, this is the one to go for.",
