So I\u2019m just gonna give a warning for those who have sensitive, oily/combination skin.I unfortunately got allergic contact dermatitis from use. My face got super red, bumpy/puffy and super itchy. Took a couple days of hydrocortisone cream and no other facial care (other than cleanser) for it to finally go away and return to my smooth pale skin. I waited and tried a second time with the same results. Now you\u2019re probably asking, why not patch test? Well guess what, I did on the inside of my elbow and no reaction at all. Super odd. But on my face, \u201cpow!\u201dThis reaction may not happen to everyone and from the other reviews it may work fantastic for some or even most people. Just be warned if your skin is like mine.I will continue to purchase Paula\u2019s Choice products because I love everything I\u2019ve gotten until this moisturizer. Don\u2019t let this particular moisturizer put you off of the brand.",
