                "reviewText": "What an excellent anti acne medication and anti aging moisturizer! No one would have thought it was possible to have these two treatments in one product. I am a 55 year old Asian woman, menopausal, to say the least, who is experiencing all those wonderful things that come along with it! Yes, I have menopausal acne. Never heard of such a thing until I started breaking out. I though those days were over. NOT! I haven't had an acne break out for decades. So this episodic event comes as a great surprise! Mind you, it's not a lot of acne but enough to concern me. I have been breaking out along my chin and around my mouth. So I went on a quest to find a solution to this, hopefully, periodic, acne break out. I have a few zits but they are stubborn and do not want to leave their happy abode. I've been using it for about 3 days now, and am finding that my zits are drying up and healing. They are no longer red and irritated and the swelling has subsided. There is some dryness and peeling but that is only occurring within and around the pimples themselves. My pores look smaller and my complexion looks and feels smoother and more even. I'm surprised at how soft and moisturized my skin feels. Gone are the days when all that existed was that \"Dry and Clear\" acne medication with benzoyl peroxide ( a product from ages ago) that dried your skin out and bleached your hair, clothes and everything that came into contact with it. It always seemed to make my skin even angrier than it was from the start. I really like how this treatment resolves my acne issues but at the same time keeps my skin calm and non volatile. Unfortunately my skin issues are two-fold. I am oily in my T-Zone but am experiencing dryness in my cheeks. However, since using this product, I find that the skin in my cheek area is more moisturized. I was using a BHA exfoliant from Paula's Choice, and it helped a little, but it didn't quite help my skin to make the turn it needed to claim victory over this war with my acne. All in all, I am more than pleased with this product. It has helped me immensely. I plan to continue using this cream for a long time to come. If anyone is in my situation and looking for advice...take it from me, this Neutralyze Renewal Complex- Maximum Strength, Anti Acne, Anti Aging Cream really, really works. This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it! Hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "I don't typically leave product reviews, but felt compelled to with this purchase in the event it can help someone else in a similar situation.So here it is.....After I'd experienced a horrific retinoid burn on my entire face from a prescription topical, I fiendishly searched the web to see if there were any hydrating products for the face that were (legitimately) non-comedogenic. I was beyond desperate for help to reverse my reaction in addition to the extreme dryness and peeling that would inevitably occur from my second-degree chemical hell.To note, I probably have the most delicate and frustrating skin on the planet. Moisturizers have ALWAYS resulted in a breakout for me, even when promising to not clog pores (many of which were \"top shelf\" labels). I just think my face hates lotion of any kind. I seem to be at this suuuper fun age when skin becomes almost bi-polar (toying in varying extremes). Sometimes it wants to break out like it did when I was an adolescent. Sometimes, its simply equivalent to the Sahara desert. Other times, it can be so shiny that it looks like I washed it with baby oil. And then there's just the plain old blotchy and discoloration phase.So I settled on the Neutralyze Renewal Complex after reading its amazing reviews. (Bonus.....it's formulated for blemish control AND ANTI-aging.....Score!)Upon first application, there was slight bit of stinging, but in no way unbearable. (Mind you, my face was still pretty inflamed from my chemical burn, so this would have been the case with any topical other than Neosporin I suspect). That said, not only did my face start to heal quickly from the trauma of my reaction, the formula was so lightweight and absorbed immediately into my skin with no sticky or greasy residue. Any previous discoloration I'd had started to fade rather quickly and my skin felt super smooth. One of the biggest benefits is that I can apply this complex at night right before bed and my face won't stick to the pillow because it dries immediately upon application (another HUGE perk for me).Neutralize even values its consumers enough to offer a FREE product of choice after using your first product for at least two weeks. Excited to take advantage, I decided to try the Neutralyze clearing serum. I only received it yesterday, but used it this morning after washing my face. While its far too early to leave a review on its benefits, I will say that I LOVE the consistency and weight of the formula so far. No burning, stinging, irritation upon application and it also dries immediately. Both products make my skin feel as though it's 'breathing' naturally and isn't being weighed down by heavy liquids.After having tried every popular and cleverly-marketed skin clearing product to help with the super inconvenient and frustrating adult/hormonal breakouts.....I truly wish I'd known of Neutralyze products years ago. I think I'm officially done with the brands I've depended on for so long that never really rectified my issues. I suppose my loyalty to them was more a mindset of..... \"well, at least they're not 'worsening' the problem\" (but they weren't fixing it either).In conclusion.....if you're like me and well beyond the days of adolescent acne but find yourself still wrought with the occasional wildfire breakout that falls from the sky.....try these products. They are SERIOUSLY UNDERRATED and not advertised like they should be. I will definitely be checking out other items in their line. The added benefit is that their products are extremely cost effective, so you won't break the bank trying \"systems\" that wrangle you (often unknowingly) into an auto-ship commitment. THAT, my friends is how to run a successful business and keep your consumers coming back.",

I\u2019ve had acne pretty much since puberty - that person that was constantly told \u201cyou\u2019ll grow out of it.\u201d 10 years later I\u2019m not sure that was the case. In the words of my lovely dermatologist, \u201cyour skin doesn\u2019t read the textbooks.\u201d Save for exchanging my epidermis for a new one, I\u2019ve used everything under the sun for acne. This is a sleek little moisturizer that packs a punch. I appreciate that it comes in a pump - it makes applying so much more measurable and satisfying to me (might be a personal thing, but I hate squeezing product). I cannot speak on behalf of the anti-aging claims, but I immediately felt the salicylic acid on my skin. Be very careful with this ingredient - less is ALWAYS more, and I\u2019ve actually burned myself with salicylic acid in the past. Directions suggest to apply a thin film - which is what I did. This is more exfoliating treatment than it is moisturizer in my view, but that is not necessarily a bad thing if you know how to use it. This claims to be a 3-in-1 product to remedy aging, acne, and dryness. I am subtracting one star because while I felt this product left my skin feeling clean and exfoliated, I did not find it very hydrating. I have dry skin as my baseline, so perhaps if there were more moisturizing ingredients I could see it being the all-in-one product it wants to be. However, I find the efficacy of this product and its active ingredients to be impressive. You can really feel this working on your skin - this is not just a filler on your bathroom shelf. Worth a try at least once!",
