I've noticed my skin becoming softer, smoother and more vibrant after using this after even the first use but even more as time is going on. You also only need a little bit to cover your full face, so this tube has gone a long way. I also really like that it\u2019s not greasy or so thick that it lingers on your face after putting it on, it dries quickly and feels great. It's a staple now and can\u2019t wait to try more from the brand !",

I use this as my daytime moisturizer and another Eight Saints product, Up the Anti, at night, which I highly suggest you try also. I like the fact that it contains natural ingredients and is cruelty-free. So glad I discovered this product line. I highly recommend this for those with combination to oily skin.

I have sensitive skin and tend to be prone to breakouts and have yet to have any purging or breakouts from the switch which I\u2019m so pleased because I desperately needed a hydrating cream fast without trial and error.

                "reviewText": "I was introduced to Eight Saints via their \u201cdiscovery\u201d kit that had samples of most of their products. I liked this moisturizer enough to purchase the full sized version.For context, here\u2019s some info about my skin: very dry but acne prone, fine lines, acne scars, age is 46.The first thing you\u2019ll notice is the smell, which is light and divine! I usually use in scented or lightly scented skin products only and this is perfect. Citrus hints.It goes on smoothly and takes a minute or two to absorb, but isn\u2019t sticky at all.I will let it set before applying makeup.While it isn\u2019t overly thick, it does a great job at calming my dry skin and making it feel smooth and moisturized. So much so that sometimes I use this at night rather than a heavier cream because it works that well. I haven\u2019t experienced breakouts using this! The quest to find a moisturizer that is hydrating and calming enough for my very dry skin but doesn\u2019t clog my pores and aggravate breakouts is nearly impossible. I think (hope!) I\u2019ve found my answer.",

The ingredients are MVPs, too - hyaluronic acid, vitamin E and antioxidants. My skin feels so soft and smooth when I use this. I love all Eight Saints products, but this one stands out!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this face moisturizer for a month now and I am very impressed with the results. It has a light and non-greasy texture that absorbs quickly into the skin. It leaves my face feeling soft, smooth, and hydrated. It also has a subtle and pleasant fragrance that is not overpowering.It does not cause any irritation. It also contains natural ingredients that nourish and protect my face. It is cruelty-free, which is a big plus for me.I would highly recommend this face moisturizer to anyone looking for a silky-smooth and affordable product. It is definitely worth every penny. It is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used and I will continue to use it for a long time.",

I like that it is not greasy and is lightweight, yet hydrating as I have sensitive skin that\u2019s prone to breakouts. Also, the fragrance is incredibly light which is hard to find these days in face creams. I am amazed at how quickly the products gets absorbed and makes my skin feel very smooth. So happy that I can now get the same luxury product as the expensive high end ones without spending big bucks. Recommend it \ud83d\udcaf",
