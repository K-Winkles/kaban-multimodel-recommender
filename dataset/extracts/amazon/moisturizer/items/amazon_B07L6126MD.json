That is an issue that I have found with a lot of facial sunscreens. They either burn your eyes or they\u2019re very white the lotion is an earthy neutral color maybe a very light brown in color this is a especially helpful when you don\u2019t have very light skin cause some sunscreen can make your skin look lighter and give it a white cast. I am older and have dry skin so I kinda wish that it was a little bit more hydrating, however I don\u2019t think it was geared for older or dryer, skins, but for sunscreen it\u2019s excellent. I am a glow girl, so I like the fact that it gives some glow to the skin is a winner for me. I would probably repurchase, but I wanted to buy a small one just to be sure I liked it. You really need a sunscreen if you use retinol and alpha hydroxy and BHA.",

This sunscreen is thick and gray, it smells like clay. Leaves my skin very sticky and shiny - some may call it dewy, I\u2019m not into that look. I want something lightweight and feeling like it\u2019s not there. That is not the case with this, I wouldn\u2019t buy it again or recommend it to a friend.",
