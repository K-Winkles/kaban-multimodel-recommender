It's fun trying new lotions but every once in a while I'd get one that is waxy or too watery or doesn't do anything to moisturize your skin. This lotion is none of those things. I can truly tell the difference in my skin when using this product- even 8 hours later my skin feels moisturized. This product has a very very light clean smell. This is now my go-to lotion, I keep it in stock all the time. Random side note, the bottle says product made in Spain.",

She said using this lotion would make fragrances last longer on one\u2019s skin. She was right. It does that and so much more. The skin gets very soft, smooth and glowing with regular use. This lotion is rich AND it gets completely absorbed by the skin. I love it and will purchase it again.",

I feel like it adds a little sheen/highlight effect.I\u2019m unsure if the softness effect is temporary and this isn\u2019t the best lotion. It\u2019s definitely a little greasy but I don\u2019t end up like oily all day. It dries. If I lived in a humid climate I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever use this, though.
