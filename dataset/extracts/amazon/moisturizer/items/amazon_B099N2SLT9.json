                "reviewText": "I'll be honest, I hate moisturizing. It's a sticky, messy affair that always leaves me feeling like a human slug. But alas, my skin craves hydration, and I'm not about to let it turn into a scaly reptile. So, I've been on the hunt for a moisturizer that would actually make me want to moisturize.Enter Cetaphil Body Moisturizer. This fragrance-free, non-greasy lotion is like a miracle in a bottle. It absorbs quickly, leaving no sticky residue behind. And it keeps my skin hydrated for a whopping 48 hours, which means I only have to moisturize every other day.I know what you're thinking: \"48 hours? That's not possible!\" But it is. I've tested it time and time again, and my skin never feels dry or flaky, even after two days without moisturizer. And OF COURSE I shower daily! After drying off, I'm still hydrated!So, if you're like me and hate moisturizing, but still want soft, smooth skin, then Cetaphil Body Moisturizer is your answer. It's the lazy person's dream come true.P.S. I'm not sure what kind of magic they put in this stuff, but it's definitely worth the effort (or lack thereof) to put on. Your skin will thank you.EDIT: While this is a wonderful moisturizer for the body, I would not use it on the face if you plan to put makeup over it. It has high amounts of silicone and petrolatum, and will cause your makeup to pill.",

It's definitely not the lightest moisturizer out there, but it does feel like it keeps my skin well moisturized. It's not the best feeling moisturizer I have ever used on my face, but overall I think it works quite well and is significantly cheaper as this bottle is about 6-7 times bigger than other facial moisturizers I have purchased around the same price range.I also chose this specific moisturizer because it was indicated from a cosmetic app that there are no harmful chemicals in this specific product. I don't know about other products from this brand, but this moisturizer is a good one.",
