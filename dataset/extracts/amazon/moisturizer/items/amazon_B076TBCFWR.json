That stuff was my go-to daily face moisturizer. This is good, but it's not quite the same.What I liked about the old Lightweight Moisturizer was that it seemed to absorb almost instantly and felt like nothing on my skin, but noticeably improved moisture/softness. This one still works in the moisture department, but it feels somehow more artificial. It's hard to describe, but it feels more like \"I put something on my skin to make it smooth\" vs \"my skin is just magically smoother\".Anyway, it still works as a moisturizer, and it doesn't give me any bad reactions, so that's good. I just wish they would bring back the old stuff.",

I've always used their Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, but I was developing some dry patches on my face that would not go away and I was looking for something more to help with that. When I saw that Simple had come out with the Water Boost Hydrating Gel Cream Face Moisturizer and saw that it was made for dry dehydrated skin I bought it right away. A few minutes after I applied it to my face I could really notice a difference! My skin felt soft and smooth, especially where the dry patches were, and it even looked better too! I've been using it now for about a week and a half and my dry patches have gone away! The only downfall is that it comes in a small tube. I wish they would come out with a bigger size, but other than that I absolutely love this moisturizer and would recommend it to anyone with dry/dehydrated/sensitive skin! I also use this product along with the Simple Water Boost Micellar Face wash, and at night I use the Simple Water Boost Skin Quench Sleeping Cream.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because of the name, Simple, the ingredient list appeared clean and great for sensitive skin, and the price point, it seemed like a great substitute for Neutrogena gel that was on backorder. I added it to my skin care regimen as soon as it arrived. Within a few days, I developed an angry inflammed pore at the side of my mouth that grew to the size of a walnut. It took 2 weeks to settle down, an left a scar. I am over 50 and have never had any type of acne scars, so this was alarming. I didn't initially attribute it to the Simple produce, just figured I had maybe done something wrong when exfoliating.The same thing happened to the right side of my upper lip a couple of weeks ago, this time involving 2 pores, and took another 3 weeks to heal, there is still a hard lump of something under my skin and a scar forming. The day I stopped using the Simple moisturizer, my pores started to look and feel better. Could be that the moisturizer is expired- I saw that it was discontinued in 2020, or could be that I am allergic to one or more of the ingredients, but it can be hazardous to open pores I guess. I discarded the remainder of the Simple moisturizer and decided I will go back to tried and true Aveeno- not even sure about trusting any other water based moisturizers.",

I used to get dry patches on my skin and reactions to perfumed moisturisers, however with this one my skin has been great, with no reactions, no dry patches and it goes well under makeup. So for anyone who has dry sensitive skin, I would very much recommend you try this one!",
