                "reviewText": "I purchased the 1.7 oz and it looks like the packaging to the 0.5 oz not sure if it\u2019s just a new design but overall I\u2019d say the feel of this water gel is actually refreshing and super moisturizing. My skin has never felt so soft. The product is lightweight and non greasy which is a huge plus. I\u2019d say the only thing keeping it from being 5 stars for me would be the fragrance, it smells kinda like laundry soap and I\u2019m not too fond of putting any fragrance in my skin care. Other than the fragrance this product is a must have for me!",

I had been thinking it was time to try some thing a little bit more reasonable in the hopes that it still provided with my face with the moisture it needed.I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re did because this face lotion is super lightweight, leaves my face, feeling moisturized, and has never caused a break out or blemish. I have been using it for a couple years now and I am very happy with how it works.The one thing I would say is that container it comes in is very thick, and the part that the lotion actually sits in his quite small. This can cause the container to be a little bit misleading with how much lotion isn\u2019t it. However, if you look at how much lotion they claim to have in the container, it does have that much.",

No s\u00e9 equivocaron, es MARAVILLOSO. Estoy encantada con mi compra, te deja la piel ultra suave e hidratada, se siente desde el primer contacto, hasta hoy llevo 4 d\u00edas us\u00e1ndolo y mi cutis ha mejorado bastante, es incre\u00edble la rapidez con la que act\u00faa. Yo tengo piel grasa y me sirve mucho para las ma\u00f1anas ya que estoy muy activa y expuesta al sol. Lo uso despu\u00e9s de aplicar mi jab\u00f3n limpiador Av\u0113ne, el cual tambi\u00e9n recomiendo demasiado, este producto reseca un poco la piel ya que te hace una limpieza extrema, pero al usar el HidroBoost de Neutrogena, es el complemento perfecto porque compensa esa resequedad y mi rostro queda limpio e impecable, despu\u00e9s de estos dos agrego mi agua termal, mi crema hidratante y bloqueador solar, son los complementos perfectos de todo cuidado facial.No s\u00e9 arrepentir\u00e1n de comprarlo, huele delicioso, muy fresco, rinde bastante ya que son una solo una toma cubres tu cara bastante bien, aparte el precio es s\u00faper accesible para un producto dermatol\u00f3gico. La paqueteria tardo solo dos d\u00edas, lo ped\u00ed un domingo y lleg\u00f3 martes, perfectamente empacado sin rayones o falta de producto, lo ped\u00ed junto a otros productos de limpieza facial. Excelente, es maravilloso.",
