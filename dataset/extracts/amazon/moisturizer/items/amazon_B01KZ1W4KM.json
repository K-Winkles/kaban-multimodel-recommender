While it\u2019s my fault for not reading the description more closely, I feel like the seller showing a photo of 3 boxes, when you only get one, is an attempt to mislead consumers. This Olay cream should not cost more than about \u00a310 per 2 oz box (it\u2019s $8 is the US). I would return my overpriced purchase for a refund but it would cost \u00a33.99 minimum to do so. I feel like I\u2019ve been cheated, but I\u2019ve learned the lesson to not buy in haste, based solely on a photo!",
