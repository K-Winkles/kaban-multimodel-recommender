This product has rightfully earned its place as my go-to daily moisturizer, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking the perfect blend of hydration and sun defense. It's a Southern skincare essential that I wouldn't want to be without!",

It goes on your face without any white cast, rubs in completely and once absorbed into your skin (within seconds) you don't feel it on any more. So hydrating and so comfortable that it makes you want to put it on everyday. Remember, sunscreen is the most important anti-aging component of any skin care routine",

                "reviewText": "I'm totally impressed by this stuff. I have dry, extremely sensitive skin due to topical acne product treatment. Most moisturizers aren't moisturizing enough for me, and usually leave my skin dry/flaking by the end of the day. If they are moisturizing enough and have an spf, they are super greasy/oily and make my face feel gross. I loved the other hydroboost moisturizer (Cityshield 25 SPF), but it started to sting when applied about a week after use and wasn't hydrating enough for me.This one is fantastic! It's more of a lightweight lotion than a gel. It does feel oily/sunscreeny when initially applied, but after 5-10 minutes when it's absorbed into my skin that feeling is completely gone. My skin is soft, hydrated, and protected from the sun. Even though it's lightweight, it really is deeply moisturizing even for my dry skin and I don't say that lightly. This product has no fragrance and thus, well, smells kind of like SPF and glue but that's fine with me. Fragrances irritate my skin anyway so it's perfect. The bottle is tiny, but I only need a very tiny amount to cover my whole face so I expect it to last for a month or two with daily use. Absolutely would recommend trying this out if you have dry/combination skin (my skin still does get oily in places and this moisturizer does a pretty good job at mattifying when it's needed).UPDATE: 2 months later and I LOVE this stuff even more. I'm still on my first bottle (which is mostly full) so it really does last a long time. And the sun protection can't be beat. I was out for a 6 hour day in the sun and had this stuff on my face and I wasn't burned, which is incredible. The rest of me? Toasted to a crisp because I hadn't applied anything at all. This is legit the best summer moisturizer ever.",
