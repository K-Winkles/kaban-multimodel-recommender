For reference, I\u2019m 45- & have very sensitive, thin, breakout prone/super red skin!Update\u2014 there is a smell. Took me a bit to notice it due to sinus/allergy issues. It does have a slightly dirty sock smell. But it fades w/in seconds and is Not a deal breaker at all. Could be if you\u2019re pregnant though\u2026 \ud83d\ude02",

Honestly, I had to try really hard, and mean really suck air in my nose to see what the fuss was about. It is so faint, hardly noticeable at all. After application, no smell at all. I've only used it 3 days now and already see a difference. I'll probably add the fifth star when I come back to update my review. Give it a try, y'all!",

My cheeks are not only red, but I also have scaley, dry patches that NO moisturizer can tackle, and now that the cold weather is here, it's even worse. I could still feel the dry patches on my cheeks even after completing my skin care routine.I've heard good things about squalane, so I decided to try this and WOW. I dabbed a little on my face (you don't need much) and the dryness went away immediately. It's been a few hours and my face is still moisturized. The interesting thing is the creme isnt heavy and thick at all, but it moisturizes like a heavy creme. Its very light.If you have very dry skin try it! I'm very happy with this product.",
