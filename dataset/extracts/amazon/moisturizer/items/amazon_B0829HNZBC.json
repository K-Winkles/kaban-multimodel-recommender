                "reviewText": "I bought this to help my poor skin out because it's very dry. I have eczema, and my face and arms get dry after showers.I only put this on my face, and it worked for the first few weeks. I skipped a few days and put it on again and felt my face begin to burn. I stopped using the cream and my face felt better. I used the face cream one last time the other day and my face turned red, my skin was tight, and my face felt like I had a fever. I stopped using it and haven't used it since.I am going to contact my dermatologist for her recommendations on face creams because this wasn't worth it. I'll suffer with dry skin.3 stars is generous for what i went through, but it has made my skin smoother and did help with my dry skin.",
