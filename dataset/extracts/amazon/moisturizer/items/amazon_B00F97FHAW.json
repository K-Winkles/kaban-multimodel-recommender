Initially I thought it would be too thick for me because I wear makeup - but it has been fine, once my make up is applied, it hasn't been a problem.",

I\u2019m really picky about moisturizer because I didn\u2019t want anything that would 1) flake and show my dry skin or 2) make me shinier than I already get! So far this moisturizer has been pretty good at going on matte/non greasy without peeling or making my skin drier. I wish it was less \u201csticky\u201d upon putting it on my face, as my nighttime non spf moisturizer goes on super smooth and creamy. This one is just much thicker I assume because of the spf in it. Also sometimes I do get very dry skin patches w this moisturizer whereas with my other non spf one I don\u2019t get dry patches. I think this moisturizer doesn\u2019t have as much hydration in it so I have to apply another moisturizer on those spots then it goes away. So not a huge deal. This is the first spf moisturizer I have tried so I can\u2019t compare it to other spf products, but overall it\u2019s a good daily moisturizer and hasn\u2019t caused any breakouts which is awesome since I have very sensitive skin. Overall I would recommend this product especially for the low price!",

The non-greasy formula with SPF 30 provides exceptional UVA/UVB protection thanks to its microfine zinc oxide sunscreen, and it spreads easily, absorbing quickly into my skin. Plus, I love that it's enriched with Niacinamide and Hyaluronic Acid, ensuring my skin stays calm and hydrated all day long. The inclusion of three essential ceramides is a game-changer, restoring and maintaining my skin's natural barrier. The only minor drawback is the non-sealed packaging, but it doesn't affect the quality. As part of my morning skincare routine, I apply this oil-free day cream as the final step, and it works flawlessly even when layered with other products.
