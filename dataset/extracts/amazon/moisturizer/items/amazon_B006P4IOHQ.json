This isn't the fault of the app, just the nature of the little screen.However, if you set up most of the things you want/need when you're connected to via a full-sized system, then usage while on the Kindle is quite satisfying.",

                "reviewText": "I agree with the other reviewer who said the app needs a save password option. That being said I realize leaving it out is more a security feature than a lack of functionality so I still gave 5 stars. Vmware is an industry leader in virtualization and after using this free app, it is easy to see why. The Kindle Fire version is responsive and easy to use. If you have a Kindle Fire and connect to a Vmware View server for your desktop access, there is absolutely no reason not to use this excellent client app.",

However, on both my Kindle Fire and my android phone there are still issues: I'm never able to connect fully. I'll have to troubleshoot this with the organization I'm trying to connect with to see if it's the app or the organization. Still very frustrating.
