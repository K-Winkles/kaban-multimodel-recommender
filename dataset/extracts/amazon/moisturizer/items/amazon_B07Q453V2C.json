                "reviewText": "I love this lotion, but the last three containers that I have had, the pumps do not work. It is really hard to get the lotion out of the container. It is very thick which is nice, but it would be nice if it would actually come out with the pump. Very frustrating. I will not buy this lotion anymore unless they fix the pump or put it in a different container is easier to access. I gave it three stars because of the container which makes it very frustrating. Like I said, the lotion is awesome.",
