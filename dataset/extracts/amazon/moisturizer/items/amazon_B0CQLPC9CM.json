It does not irritate my skin at all. Using it on my hands as well. Does not have a noticeable scent, and does not feel heavy on the skin! It works well as a lip balm too! I love that it has multiple uses. I will definitely be repurchasing this. Bonus for me is it fits nicely in my makeup bag and I can use it as a primer in a pinch! My skin feels hydrated! If you are a peri or post menopausal woman I highly recommend this! I have extremely dry skin and am prone to cystic acne!",

Other than that, it\u2019s a normal balm stick, it\u2019s slightly greasy like it glides really easily and make ur skin feel hydrated but I feel like it\u2019s more greasy than hydrated. If anything, think of like putting some very thin and lightweight vaseline over it face, that\u2019s abt how I can describe it :0",
