The hyaluronic acid works wonders in maintaining moisture, and the plant extracts add a refreshing touch. It feels incredibly light on the skin, and a little goes a long way, so you don't need to reapply often.I appreciate the fact that this cream caters to all skin types. Whether you have dry, oily, or sensitive skin, it seems to adapt and provide the necessary hydration without causing any issues.The cream doesn't leave any residue or greasy feeling on my skin, which is a huge plus.

The top doesn\u2019t come off but instead it\u2019s a pump mechanism. This in theory is a good idea, possibly preventing bacteria from your face getting back in the lotion container, but I also think this will leave lotion in the container when it\u2019s ready to throw away.
