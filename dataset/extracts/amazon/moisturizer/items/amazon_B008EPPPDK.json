I have rosacea, and this is the time of year I have to switch to a heavier nighttime moisturizer to combat the cold and dry Midwest weather.My first bottle arrived with shrink wrap, which I thought was odd because the listing promotes reducing waste and getting rid of shrink wrapping their products. I used it later that night, and there was something very off with the scent. It almost smelled like what I would expect self tanner to smell like if it went bad. I came back to the listing to see if anyone else complained about an unscented lotion smelling so gross, and I came across a couple of questions asking the same thing. Apparently that smell was not normal, so I requested a new one from Amazon.My new one arrived, not in shrink wrap, and with a large expiration date sticker on it. I tried it out immediately and the difference was night and day. I\u2019m very glad I didn\u2019t continue to use a spoiled moisturizer on my already extremely sensitive skin.TLDR: great moisturizer, especially for sensitive skin. Check product smell immediately if yours arrives in shrink wrap.",

                "reviewText": "This moisturizer is pretty good. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s the most moisturizing I\u2019ve ever had though. My skin is super dry during the winter so I was looking for the holy grail that would moisturize but not irritate. My skin is prone to breakouts so I\u2019m weary of new products. I\u2019ve been using this for about 2 weeks and it has helped a bit with moisture but I\u2019ve also had a couple breakouts on my jawline. Nothing crazy or anything though. That\u2019s likely just my skin\u2019s reaction to a new product. It feels really good initially and then after an hour or so is completely soaked in. Not necessarily in a bad way. It has no discernible scent which I like. I think it\u2019s worth a try if you\u2019re in the market for a good quality moisturizer. I just think results will vary person to person.",
