                "reviewText": "I purchased the 1.7 oz, of Extra-Dry Skin gel-cream. I honestly was seriously skeptical about buying this. For the first time ever, the skin on my face just absolutely dried up. It was seriously dry and at the time I feared it was psoriasis. I originally was using just some random lotion (body lotion to be exact), and then I bought some off brand cetaphil. That only put a layer on my face that went away quickly. As a college student that lacks money, I was really skeptical because I didn't want to buy crap that was $14 and have it not work, but my skin got so bad that I would try anything. The box and everything came in tact. At first I tried it, it did burn. I can't contribute it to the ingredients in the bottle because previously I had basically just stripped my skin of everything that almost anything put on my face, even if it was meant to be soothing, burned. I continued with putting it on my face when I felt it was extremely dry, so usually mornings when I wake up, right after classes (which is usually around 3-4 hours later, and then right after my shower (since I exfoliate). Now it is not completely \"long lasting\". I do have to reapply a few times a day, but in the long run, I have noticed that my skin has become a lot more moist and \"plump\" compared to what it was before. Before I rubbed my face and it sounded like sandpaper and felt even worse. Now my skin feels amazing, my face no longer burns when I apply this stuff, and overall it really does give a cool refreshing feeling. There really is no smell to it, unless you are super super sensitive to smells and directly sniffed the cream then I guess you could say it is \"chemically\", and by chemically I just mean like nothing has been added. They just add the ingredients and nothing else. You may smell something every time you open the bottle, maybe if your face is close enough, but once you apply it to your skin I noticed the smell vanishes quite quickly. I read a lot of the reviews and I took a chance and I am extremely happy with this product. Even when my skin goes back to normal, I plan on using this stuff. For me this stuff worked like a miracle. Once applied definitely gives you a smoother feel to the face, but don't expect immediate results. It does go away and that dry skin will come back, but much like an ointment or medicine, you just have to keep applying it when you feel necessary. In no way shape or form am I being paid to write a good review. I just found this stuff as a new college student in a slightly new environment (same state, just different city), with skin problems, to be an amazing solution that is worth the \"splurge\".",

Its lightweight yet deeply hydrating formula works wonders on my extra-dry skin, leaving it feeling soft, smooth, and incredibly refreshed. The infusion of hyaluronic acid provides an intense boost of hydration without feeling greasy or heavy.What truly sets this moisturizer apart is its ability to outshine its more expensive competitors. I've tried high-end products, but none have delivered the same level of hydration and skin-smoothing results as Neutrogena Hydro Boost. The gel-cream texture is a dream to apply, and it absorbs quickly, making it perfect for my daily skincare routine.I can't recommend this product enough to anyone seeking a moisturizer that not only delivers exceptional hydration but also surpasses its pricier counterparts. Neutrogena Hydro Boost is a game-changer, and I'm thrilled to have discovered it!",

However, the only downside for me is the price point. While it's an effective product, I feel that the amount you get for the price is a bit too much.

                "reviewText": "The Story:Like everyone else I am getting older and with time our skin changes, so decided to have an overhaul of make-up and skincare products. I\u2019ve got to the stage where I find using foundation more of a highlighter of my skins faults more than anything else and so have been looking to improve the overall texture and brightness of my skin in order to negate using it. Part of my revised regime is the inclusion of hyaluronic acid containing products and this is a review of one of them.The Product:This is a 50ml pot of a lightweight and easy to disperse gel cream. It sinks in immediately leaving the skin silky smooth to the touch without greasiness. The product contains hyaluronic acid a naturally occurring molecule in body tissue, which as the years progress, decreases. Hyaluronic acid is a non-irritating skincare ingredient. It is suitable for all skin types, as all skin types need hydration, but it is especially beneficial for aging or dehydrated skin. Hyaluronic acid is an exceptional hydrator capable of holding 1000 times (one thousand) its weight in water which it draws from the atmosphere giving the skin the hydration it needs because the hyaluronan in the body is degraded and synthesised by a third every day. I use it twice a day and my skin is now beautiful and supple.The ingredients:Not all Neutrogena\u00ae Hydro Boost products are made equal. This particular item contains Methylparaben which is a type of paraben. Parabens are chemicals that are often used as preservatives to give products a longer shelf life. They\u2019re added to food or cosmetics to prevent the growth of mould and other harmful bacteria. Methylparaben doesn\u2019t accumulate in the body. In fact, the body flushes the chemical out quite quickly. However, if this is something you are trying to avoid you may want to bypass this.The Verdict:This is an ultra light moisturiser that absorbs quickly into the skin leaving no heaviness or greasiness. Being non-comedogenic it doesn\u2019t block pores and is a fabulous addition to my regime; I love this. All in all this has been the right choice (for me) and I think you will like it too.The above narrative is my opinion only and does not in any way represent Neutrogena\u00ae or Amazon.If you found my review helpful, please click the \u2018Helpful\u2019 button below so I know it has been of use.",
