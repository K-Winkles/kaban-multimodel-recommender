                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Good balance of moisture and oil control",
                "reviewText": "I picked this up to accompany a few other Tula acne treatment products (Keep it Clear Foam Cleanser, Clear it Up Acne Clearing + Correcting Gel, and the Go Away Acne Spot Treatment). It's really lightweight and absorbs into my skin quickly without it feeling like there's lasting slimy or oily residue remaining (even if I leave some on my fingers - totally dry within like a minute). By the same token, my face skin sometimes feels a bit taut and in need of additional / subsequent moisturizer. Depending on your skin situation, you might consider only applying this moisturizer in your T-Zone or problem areas, and applying a more hydrating moisturizer in the less oil-prone areas.Even though it goes on lightweight, it comes out of its container as a decently thick gel. It's not runny at all. I think it's a tad thicker than the 24-7 Moisture Hydrating Day & Night Cream but they're similar in terms of holding form once I get a dab on my fingers.It smells a tad unpleasant, but not even close to unbearably so, and in a \"medicated\" scent sort of way. It smells clean, but not perfumey. I've been having to alternate cleansers and moisturizers from day to day, or at least morning to night, because the targeted combination dried out my skin and chapped / burned it within 2 days of morning and night full routines. I've been alternating the acne products out for the Cult Classic and the Day & Night Cream and my skin is much less irritated, but also staying clear.Definitely recommend waiting several minutes after applying any of the other acne products and letting the skin settle itself before applying this moisturizer. I've noticed that if I apply it too soon after another salysilic or benzoyl peroxide product, it causes a slight burning sensation. Basically, Tula's acne kit is a tad overkill for my somewhat sensitive skin. While it definitely cleared everything right up, it also caused other types of blemishes and discomfort in the process. You 100% should be careful around your lips and use some lip balm before putting this moisturizer on. My lips have been getting dried out from getting traces of it and/or my other products on them.I definitely think this stuff has helped lighten the appearance of my scarring (especially in conjunction with the Get Toned 10% Pro-Glycolic Resurfacing Toner (which I haven't had to switch up to balance out all the other irritants) and the Clear it Up Gel. It's hard to say what one item might be pulling the most weight when I'm reigning down (metaphorical, medical) nuclear fire on my acne, but it's likely a little of column A and a little of column B.I definitely feel like my oil is more under control now though. I don't feel \"super saturate a blotter/tissue, full-clog-ahead, T-Zone\" greasy by lunchtime anymore, just sort of a much more tolerable, more \"normal\" level of oil/moisture.On a final note, all of these products have worked wonders on my face, which seems to mostly be affected by mild monthly hormonal acne breakouts and an all-the-time excessive oil / large pore / visible, dark comedone disposition. I am, unfortunately, also blessed with acne...well, everywhere else. I only recently started regularly treating my chest, back, and tailbone areas with these same Tula products, and so far there has been minimal progress. I seem to be getting fewer zits in these areas overall, but it will likely take a very long time to correct the hyperpigmentation over these larger areas of thicker skin. It may just be a bit of optimism on my part, but I think there's been slightly noticeable progress in that regard on my chest moreso than other areas. I'm about a month into this regimen, for reference.All in all, I will likely buy this product again unless something falls in my lap. My skin has never been terribly agreeable with me or the products I try, but a friend suggested Tula about a year ago and within days, my skin was clearer and brighter / less sallow.",

                "reviewText": "I've only have this product for about a week, but I really like the feel of it. It's super lightweight and I believe it's oil free. As for clearing my skin I think it's starting to do its job. I've been trying to work out a combination of Tula products because my skin is a little sensitives. Using the whole acne line has made my face feel a bit dry. But I know I will for sure keep this moisturizer in my lineup. I love that it doesn't make my face feel greasy after I apply and I know it's helping my acne improve even if it's just a little bit. I would definitely recommend this product (I'm still working my way through the rest of the products).",

                "reviewText": "In general I am a huge fan of the TULA product line and they tend to be a little bit more on the expensive side but I do believe you get what you pay for. This acne fighting moisturizer is coming in handy right now. My face is usually very easy going but with wearing masks all the time it is taking a bit of a beating and is breaking out more oftehn than usual. So giving it a bit more than it needs to counter that is essential right now.I found that this acne-fighting moisturizer really helps. It comes in a beautiful little squeeze tube that has a pump dispenser at the end. The smell of it is reminiscent of a acne treatment so the scent isn't the best but I am more concerned about it working.It is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. It leaves no residue on the skin which is great. My skin feels moisturize and so far my breakouts have been kept to a minimum. I for one am a fan and the proof is in the pudding as they say.",
