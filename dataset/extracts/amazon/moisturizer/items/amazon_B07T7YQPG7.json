                "reviewText": "Garnier SkinActive 24H Moisture Cream with Rose Water and Hyaluronic Acid is an amazing value, plus it feels and smells heavenly. I'm in my 50s and often in need of a little moisture and skin plumbing. Yet my skin still tends to be oily and prone to breakouts, so water creams (non-oil and non-cream-based) are a life-saver for me. It's lightweight, feels cool, soothing, and silky, and glides on easily so a dime-sized blob is enough for my face, neck, and chest. I use retinol serum at night and a copper peptides serum and sunscreen during the day, plus niacinamide and hyaluronic acid serums, so I use this only for moisturizing as needed. There are other water-based creams of similar price and quality, but I'm addicted to this stuff because of how lovely and silky it feels and also because of the light, delicate, faintly-herbal rose water scent. It doesn't smack you upside the head screaming ROSES like so many other rose water products do. Nor does it smell cloyingly sweet. It just delivers the skin-friendly benefits of rosewater (for toning and tightening) with just a hint of roses that I could inhale all day, and I'm usually a lavender kinda gal. Also, Garnier doesn't test on animals which is nice.",

                "reviewText": "This moisturizing cream is fantastic. I don't know what it is, but my skin feels really wonderful and looks better. I feel it when I touch my face right after using, and also the next morning. I'm not sure what it is, if it's this or theRoC Daily Resurfacing Facial Disks I got at the same time. (I'll also review those) I'm using these two new products together, and my skin is softer and brighter.There is a scent to this, but it's very light and really pleasant. I say that as someone who's extremely sensitive to scent. In fact, I had to return the Neutrogena Triple Age Repair Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer (full name-with SPF 25 Sunscreen & Vitamin C, Dark Spot Remover & Firming Face & Neck Cream with Glycerin & Shea Butter) because it was sooo scented, and that scent just didn't fade. I was inundated with it for hours. Finally washed it off. I really don't care how well a moisturizer works if I can't stomach the scent.This Garnier moisturizer goes on light and smooth. It sinks in well. It does not feel sticky. It is not oily. It moisturizes beautifully. You don't need tons of it, use sparingly so the jar will last a long time. You can use it daily.Try it and do double-takes when you pass a mirror.",

                "reviewText": "I have very sensitive, dry skin and it doesn\u2019t always respond well to certain hydration products\u2026 But this one was definitely the exception to that! First off, it smells soooo good, refreshing and sweet, but not overpowering, which I like. I always hate lotions that smell too much like perfume. Secondly, the texture and consistency of this moisturizer is just perfect. It\u2019s almost like a watered down gel texture. The light-weight consistency helps it spread onto my skin better as well as absorbs into my skin better. It doesn\u2019t sit on top of my skin like other moisturizers I\u2019ve used (that usually gives the effect of an oily, greasy sheen)\u2026 A little goes a long ways, which is nice because other moisturizers seem to only work when you slather on a whole greasy glob. But you don\u2019t have to do that with this one\u2026 This is the best bang for your buck.",

This moisturizer goes on super smoothly and absorbs into my skin right away. I love it because it\u2019s water based, so there is no greasy feel after application. It\u2019s also a clean line, so it doesn\u2019t have some of the harmful ingredients that other skin care products contain. I plan to continue using this moisturizer as long as it\u2019s around. Highly recommend!",
