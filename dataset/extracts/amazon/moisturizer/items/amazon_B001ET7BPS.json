                "reviewText": "This is the best moisturizer I've tried and I'm a big skin person. First, I'm more into the natural-ingredient products than the products with more chemical ingredients (i.e., Ponds). Second, I have combination skin, whichis acne prone. Moisturizer is a huge conundrum for me because oils in your pores can cause acne, and of course a moisturizer--while it may soften your skin--can cause blocked pores, which in turn causes acne. Here's what I've tried:1. Derma E Tea Tree Oil and Vitamin E Moisturizer: You can tell the tea tree oil is a prominent ingredient because the smel is so strong, but this produt is too oily. My face looks oily after se--especially my forehead, and it feels oily.2. Desert Essence Oil Free moisturizer: so \"oil-free\" that after use, you feel like you never used anything at all. My face, in fact, felt as dry as it did before application.3. Raw Aloe Vera Plant: I buy the plant stem from a local store, cut it into pieces and squeeze the juice on my face at night. I figured why buy products with watered down aloe when I can apply aloe directly on my skin? Well, the smell is horrible and it's really gooey. It does dry but when you wash it off the next morning, you have to wash extra hard just to get the goo off. A lot of time and energy.4. Alba Botaica Sea Kelp Night Creme: good, but heavier and you feel like you're wearing a cream on your faceNOW FOR THE PRODUCT OF THE HOUR: Alba oil free moisturizerExcellent. The product is silky smooth. After you put it on, your face feels moisturized, but if you run you index finger all around your face, you can't feel the moisturizer. So, at night, it doesn't get on my pillow--like the other moisturizers--while still getting the job done. My skin also looks good, but it doesn't make your skin look oily. It just looks \"non-dry\".",

                "reviewText": "I noticed there were no reviews from guys, which is unfortunate. We men are stupidly told to use harsh soaps and alcohol-based aftershave...or be too effeminate. A college friend insisted I try her lotion. Within a week of of use, my face was clearer, less oily, and had less redness. My skin was much less angry about my attempts to stupidly dry it out!This works great for me with my dry skin but somewhat oily nose - the Alba is not oily but easily absorped and soothing (Some said it doesn't absorp?! I have to put normal lotion on my hands first or my hands soak all of this up!). I used cheap Nivea for men for a while, which is a bit greasy, and the expensive Art of Shaving process, which was alright. I have sensitive skin and thick facial hair so after shaving I needed something calming. I shave with Avalon Organic's lavender stuff, and I use this to calm any leftover discomfort. It doesn't smell a lot, which I like since people often smell like a chemical factory and when I rarely use cologne this doesn't interfere.Ultimately, everyone's skin is different, but this is a fine pick for men, too. I took off one star because we men don't get why abundant things like aloe and green tea cost so much. Parents, girlfriends, and wives should encourage boys and men to try some lotion. This is a great product to recommend.2016 Update--I was buying as I have for 10 years and am surprised this review was here. I still love it, despite all the new brands for men. I've tried Lather's light moisturizer (too insubstantial and expensive), some Jack Black and Every Man Jack oil and non-oil based creams (all pricy and a bit heavy), gf's $80 creams (with gold I guess), etc. The only changes I've made are that I shave with Jack Black's triple comfort stuff--the best I've ever tried for my N. European skin with Sicilian hair (also tried EOS, which was good); I use often use a light sunscreen over this (Olay SPF15 or Alba's Very Emollient SPF30 when I bike, but I personally see little difference in non-oil sunscreens); and I sheepishly admit that, for sunny vacations, I use Dr. Gross alpha beta pads to tan so I'm not tempted to zap myself! I've convinced several friends, including one with psoriasis, to try this, and most have liked it.",

I ordered the 2 pack, but only photographed one. They came quickly, wrapped together. No leaks, etc. during shipping. I've used this moisturizer for years; I've tried other products but nothing else compares. Its oil free, so it doesn't leave my face oily or greasy, it smells nice, and it's light weight compared to other moisturizers. I have very sensitive skin and it has never made me break out.
