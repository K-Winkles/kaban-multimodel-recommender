                "reviewText": "I have *extremely* oily skin prone to acne and large pores. Finally I said enough is enough have changed quite a few things about my skincare routine (so I'm not 100% sure if this product by itself improved my skin or if it was the whole arsenal of products that helped me).2-3 days after I started using this cream AM and PM my skin started feeling smooth and I noticed significantly less oil on my skin at the end of the day. The cream absorbs super fast and doesn't leave any greasy film whatsoever - more like the opposite - sometimes it even feels like I didn't moisturize at all. Would 10/10 recommend it for oily sensitive skin.PS: I am also using Paula's Choice BHA exfoliator every 3 days (apply at night only), hyaluronic acid (the Ordinary) in the morning after the shower on damp skin followed by this moisturizer and sunscreen, and niacinamide (the Ordinary) in the evening followed by this moisturizer and retinol serumhope this helps",

I have sensitive combination skin and hormonal acne, and this is my go-to moisturizer for humid summer days and those weeks where I know my skin is going to misbehave. Sometimes I use a heavier oil serum in a few places, because this is quite light, but I like that flexibility. It doesn\u2019t react with either adapalene or clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide acne treatments, so I can use them together without problems. And being cruelty-free is mandatory!",

I have very dry skin and being a diabetic very wary of what creams I use. This cream made my skin feel very soft and silky. After only a couple of uses on my arms and legs, I felt that I did see a difference. I highly recommend.",
