                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been looking for a less expensive dupe for the Clinique Moisture Surge which is sometimes the only thing I can use on my face when it\u2019s really sensitive (recently found out I have rosacea, which explains a lot). This product is *super affordable* and has a fantastic ingredients list, plus it does not irritate my skin despite being fragranced.There are a lot of extracts that are beneficial but also be on the lookout if you have any allergies: watermelon, tomato, apricot kernel oil, red seaweed, ivy gourd (related to bitter melon), neem (fantastic for clearing and healing skin), eggplant, aloe, holy basil and turmeric. Sodium hyaluronate is the second ingredient, plus glycerin, and a Vitamin C derivative Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate. The Amazon ingredients say something about soy beans and retinol (which would be weird for a daytime product like this), so it sounds like they need to be updated.Anyway, that\u2019s a pretty amazing line up for something that is normally less than $10 (I got it for FOUR DOLLARS on sale!). It does take a little longer to absorb and sometimes feel a little sticky/tacky because it\u2019s lacking some of the other ingredients that would make it absorb faster which some may find objectionable like volatile silicons or simple/denatured alcohols. However, some people may appreciate that as a base for makeup or not mind an extra five minutes to absorb if they have a silicon or alcohol sensitivity. I do wish that they had not added artificial fragrance since there are already enough extracts going on here to probably give it some kind of natural herby scent, but I\u2019m guessing they are trying for something akin to the Glow Recipe stuff that seems to be popular (haven\u2019t tried it personally). The scent doesn\u2019t linger terribly long (less than 5 minutes while it is absorbing), but I\u2019m just not super into smells so this is a little annoying for me. However, considering the price and the lineup of ingredients, I\u2019ll deal with five minutes of watermelon candy face. Will repurchase for sure when my current jar runs out. Which might be soon since I feel like I can liberally slather this all over my face and neck whenever I want since I didn\u2019t pay $50 for it.",

                "reviewText": "I took antibiotics for approximately fifteen years, underwent chemical peels, light therapy, hormonal therapies, dermabrasion, and finally it was Accutane that cleared my skin for many years. I was in heaven. Then out of nowhere, when I leapt to the other side of mid-life, I started having occasional bumps again. Anything would cause a flare-up, even applying sunscreen was sure to clog pores causing a Godzilla eruption. Although I have been very upset to revisit the past through acne, I was surprised to read, recently, that 40% of women who have never had acne are now experiencing it at mid-life and beyond --- well into their sixties. I don't know what's up with that, but I feel for all my sister friends who are in the same boat.I've tried every single skin care product available, spending thousands of dollars. The only thing that helped some was 'Clean & Clear OIL-FREE' moisturizer. But this contains Salicylic Acid and repeated use was making my aging skin look dry, somewhat lathery, and VERY sensitive to the sun.On a lark, I decided to order 'Yes To Tomatoes' for clear skin. I have given it a good therapeutic trial before offering an endorsement. I have just finished my first bottle and have my next on order. I'm amazed that this moderately priced product has performed so well. My skin is dewey, the fine lines are diminishing, and even the deeper ones are showing improvement. I've even been getting some complements on my complexion --- for the first time, ever. But, the most important factor is: I have only had one bump, early in the trial; it cleared up promptly, when using the 'Yes Spot Stick' at bedtime (which I highly recommend, too).On days when I have worn more makeup than usual, or I've been exercising, or working in the garden, I will use the 'Yes Deep Cleansing Pads'. Love them! They are salicylic acid pads, but for some reason when I use this product, it makes my face feel soft and clean, unlike the Clean & Clear.I love that these products are Paraben-free and 98% natural. I often wonder how much my skin was previously reacting to chemicals that it just couldn't tolerate.The only negative for me was the smell which is a little strong. It took me a little time to adjust to it, but it does dissipate quickly and I hardly notice it now.",

I don't feel the need to use some kind of oil or creamy moisturizer on top of this because it seems to seal in the moisture all by itself. I want to briefly mention that I do experience mild and temporary redness when I use this. It subsides quickly and I usually react this way with most products, even the most gentle so I'm not sure how much the redness pertains to this product specifically. For now, I'm absolutely going to keep using this but I'll update this review if I encounter any issues",
