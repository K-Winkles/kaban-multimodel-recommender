                "reviewText": "Korean skincare is known to be light and airy and this product does not disappoint. I live in the Midwest where we are going through winter right now and it provides the right amount of moisture without feeling greasy at all. It also absorbs into the skin quite quickly and makes your face feel hydrated which is important during this time for me ass I tend to get very dry on my cheeks during this time of year with the cold and the heater being on at all times. I have combination skin and it truly adapts to the weather. This product I know would suit me during any time of the year as it is light and doesn't interfere with my make-up. When it comes to make-up I use the underpainting technique but apply the product with a brush and do not apply foundation. I typically only spot treat/underpaint in areas where it is needed (concealer under the eye, around the nasolabial folds, on any blemishes) and apply a cream blush (with a brush) from Milk and cream contour stick (with a brush) from ABH. There has been no pilling of product with this \"Ongredients Daily Aqua Bomb Cream\" moisturizer underneath.",

I've never tried products from this k-beauty brand before but the ingredients seemed quite high quality so I was interested to see how the formulation holds up to other similar aqua creams. :) So far, this aqua cream is very hydrating and does have a cooling and soothing effect on my skin that I've rarely experienced with other brands. My skin felt very soft and it wasn't greasy or oily on my face with a quick dry down time of only a few minutes.I didn't notice any smells in this product and was unable to find any added fragrance in the ingredient list which is great news for people who have issues with fragrance or sensitivities to smells! I enjoyed the light texture and lack of smell though I personally don't mind fragrance in my skincare as I am not sensitive to it.If you are looking for a good moisturiser that is lightweight and doesn't have a smell, this is a great option!",

It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft to the touch. I love the ingredients, especially green tea, and it feels cooling when it's applied.

It feels so so nice on the skin and doesn't make me breakout or oily. The scent is light and not overwhelming. I couldn't recommend it enough, this is definitely a hidden gem.",
