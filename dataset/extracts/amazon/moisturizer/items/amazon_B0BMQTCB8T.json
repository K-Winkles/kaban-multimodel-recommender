        "description": "After being kidnapped as a child, Daisuke Dojima became obsessed with the words of the enigmatic woman who rescued him. Convinced that he is destined to protect his friends, he's focused on that prediction to the point of alienating his classmates. Then the entire prefecture of Tokyo where he lives, Shibuya, is suddenly ripped through the fabric of time to an apocalyptic future where humanity is waging a desperate battle against the mysterious Revisions. Attacked by mechanical monsters, Daisuke and his friends are saved by Milo, the woman who rescued him before, who reveals that Daisuke and his classmates have the unique qualifications to pilot special mechas called String Puppets. Now the teenagers must become warriors, holding the line of battle while Milo's organization struggles to find a way to restore Shibuya in time and finally defeat the REVISIONS!",
