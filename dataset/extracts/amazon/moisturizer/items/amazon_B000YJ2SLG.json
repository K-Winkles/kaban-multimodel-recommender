Enter CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion \u2013 a game-changer in the realm of skincare.I recently found myself in dire need of a solution to combat my dry skin, particularly on my face. I had tried countless products, only to be disappointed by their thick consistency that refused to blend seamlessly into my skin, leaving residue in my beard and an unpleasant oily film on my hands. That's when I stumbled upon CeraVe, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer.First and foremost, let's talk about texture. The CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion boasts a lightweight and silky-smooth texture that glides effortlessly onto the skin.

                "reviewText": "This is my Folliculitis Journey and i include ALL THE PRODUCTS I USED to get rid of it.I got Folliculitis on my groin area, i had no idea what it was since i have never had it but it started spreading down my legs and leaving these dark marks/scars. The lesions started multiplying, i went to the doctors who gave me an ointment gel, which did absolutely nothing for me, it was an acne treatment.Since it started getting hotter and summer was near i knew i had to act fast or else i would have to wear pants all summer. First things first, from my research it states not to shave to prevent he spread of Folliculitis, so yes i did just that. I didn't shave for over a month...i know gross but it had to be done.*If you do decide to shave, use a new fresh blade every time you shave in order to prevent spread. Also if you have folliculitis on your legs don't use the same blade on your armpits etc.I looked up items on amazon and read reviews for \"Almond Clear: Body Clearing Serum\" https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0866B6CV1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1I decided to give it a try, i started with Level 1 and used it with the Hibliclens antibacterial soap as everyone in the reviews did. I already had the soap since its so amazing and i recommend everyone have thissoap in their home it works miracles. I was already using this soap by itself for about 2 weeks prior to buying the Almond Clear bottle and i noticed no difference. When i read that buyers were combining both Almond Clear Serum and the soap i decided to do the same, but still i felt that Hibliclens did not do much for me. My Folliculitis was very stubborn!https://www.amazon.com/Molnlycke-Hibiclens-HIBICLENS-LIQ-OZ/dp/B00E5R65SA/ref=sr_1_3?crid=GNSU7PU7YVEN&dchild=1&keywords=hibiclens&qid=1590613599&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011&rnid=2470954011&rps=1&sprefix=hibi%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-3*Everyone is different so what works for someone might not work for others.As for the Almond Clear serum, i noticed immediately a difference! overnight the lesions seemed like they shrunk.The only complaint is that the bottle doesn't contain much. I had a big area to cover so 1 bottle was finished in 1 week. I would definitely recommend you purchase the bigger bottle so its worth your money (they have the 4oz option available). Also level 1 is more for someone who might have like 1-4 lesions..or for sensitive areas like the face. I felt like it made a difference but i definitely needed something stronger to completely get rid of them, i should've skipped to level2 like everyone else did in the reviews.I bought level 2 when i ran out of level 1 and i definitely noticed a huge difference! Listen to me right now, if you suffer from severe Folliculitis YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS!Honestly my case got so bad i had so many lesions on my groin area they started spreading down to my thighs and legs and even my private area :(i was so stressed i couldn't wear shorts and even pants would cause me to breakout in hives and the infected areawould get so red and irritated easily. It got bad!Luckily this product saved my life..I started using this April 20, today is May 27 and i am pretty much cured, the lesions are all gone and even the scars are faded! This product faded the nasty dark marks.The reviews recommend using up to 2xs a day. This did not work for me, my skin is very sensitive so i would only use 1x a day, every night after i showered i would apply and leave overnight. I do have to say that this product makes your skin peel and drys your skin out. For me, it made my skin excessively dry and i would shed skin almost everyday.Because my skin was getting beyond dry i decided to moisturize. I used CeraVe Moistorizing Lotion every morning when i woke up.*(make sure to always wash your hands before and after you apply a product to prevent from spreading to other body parts).https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YJ2SLG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1I used this lotion because alot of people with skin issues use this lotion and it works well, i had no issues, great product!I shower every night so i decided to use a Folliculitis body wash i found on Amazon. I leave it on the area for about 5 mins then i rinse. I also noticed a big difference with this product right after the 1st use! I used this product for about 1.5 months?https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GBL3RES/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s04?ie=UTF8&psc=1Another product i used in the shower was the Nizoral Shampoo. I saw YouTube videos of people who used it on their arms and face to treat folliculitis. Luckily i already had this shampoo as well, its to treat dandruff, i recommend for both dandruff and for folliculitis, i feel like this items made a difference. I replaced the Hibliclens soap with this product, i leave it on the area for about 5 mins then rinse in the shower. I used this product for about a month.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AINMFAC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The final product i used was Defense Soap, i used this soap in order to kill any bacteria or fungi that might have been causing the Folliculitis. I felt like this also made a difference and i washed my whole body with this in order to prevent any Folliculitis from spreading on my stomach or arms...I was terrified of getting it any where else, the soap makes you feel fresh and clean specially after a workout! It does dry your skin so you don't have to use everyday, but if you do i would definitely recommend to moisturize with the CeraVe lotion or just any lotion in general. I used this product for about a month.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HYBK2YF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1*Be sure to use these products EVERYDAY, TO SEE RESULTS YOU HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT.If you are on a budget: Out of all the products i would definitely recommend you use the Almond Clear Serum and the Folliculitis Body Wash by Ovante. Yes i know this is a VERY LONG routine and so many products to use, but all my folliculitis is pretty much gone already! It is pricey to buy all these items, but honestly i was willing to pay $100+ in order to get rid of this and it was worth it!I guess it depends how bad do you want to get rid of this? I think its worth it!Do your research, find out what works for you, try different products until you find something that works for your skin. I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE!",

It does actually heal skin's barrier as promised. It's one of the few body lotions that I can use in high humidity, as it absorbs fast without a tacky feel. It's the perfect texture, very creamy but not too thick. It works equally as well on the face too. When it's very cold outside in December through February, I use a different cream textured product, but the rest of the year this stuff if awesome! Cerave products deliver!",

                "reviewText": "Assim como qualquer cosm\u00e9tico, a pessoa que compra pode n\u00e3o apresentar bons resultados, mas, no meu caso, est\u00e1 mais que aprovado. Falando por mim, notei que minha pele est\u00e1 com uma maciez jamais tida anteriormente, al\u00e9m de estar com um vi\u00e7o maravilhoso.Estou no \u00e1pice da minha adolesc\u00eancia, 16 anos, ent\u00e3o tenho acnes de vez em quando e possuo hiperpigmenta\u00e7\u00f5es na \u00e1rea das minhas bochechas. Minha pele, em muitos momentos, ficava ressecada, descascando, e eu n\u00e3o usava hidratante de forma cotidiana, porque, embora tivesse muitos, nenhum funcionava bem para mim, s\u00f3 traziam ainda mais oleosidade para a minha pele e, consequentemente, acnes e cravos.Pesquisei muito sobre o CeraVe e decidi adquirir. Felizmente, a minha pele o recebeu muito bem, se adaptou logo de in\u00edcio. Uso no skincare diurno e noturno. Mas, h\u00e1 uns dias atr\u00e1s, decidi, no per\u00edodo da manh\u00e3, voltar a aplicar um hidratante de vitamina c na pele e, no per\u00edodo da noite, o CeraVe, mas minha pele n\u00e3o reagiu bem, ent\u00e3o voltei para o meu favoritinho. Prossigo usando diariamente, dia e noite.Quanto ao gel de limpeza, \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m muito gentil. Faz espuma suficiente e \u00e9 econ\u00f4mico, pois n\u00e3o precisa de muito produto para conseguir realizar uma limpeza de qualidade. Eles n\u00e3o t\u00eam perfume, n\u00e3o irrita o nariz e n\u00e3o irrita os olhos (apenas se colocar muito nos olhos, \u00f3bvio). Lavo a pele por dois minutos e isso tem me ajudado muito.\u00c9 interessante saber que s\u00f3 usar cosm\u00e9tico n\u00e3o melhora a pele e dependendo do grau de acne (se for o caso), n\u00e3o vai acontecer milagre. Al\u00e9m da lo\u00e7\u00e3o, que \u00e9 super levinha, n\u00e3o deixa a pele grudenta nem nada assim, eu uso o gel de limpeza da CeraVe (ambos os produtos com as tr\u00eas ceramidas essenciais e o \u00e1cido hialur\u00f4nico), tamb\u00e9m uso um s\u00e9rum de uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de boas porcentagens de \u00e1cidos e o meu protetor solar. Ademais, me alimento bem (n\u00e3o parei de comer as minhas besteiras, s\u00f3 equilibro tudo) e bebo muit\u00edssima \u00e1gua.Cuide-se bem! E d\u00ea uma chance para o CeraVe (lo\u00e7\u00e3o - ou creme - e o gel)! Se n\u00e3o funcionar para o seu rosto, teste na pele do corpo, n\u00e3o se arrepender\u00e1. Uso nos joelhos, cotovelos, p\u00e9s e axilas, deixou tudo SUPER macio e hidratado - como jamais foram - em tr\u00eas dias.Veio tudo embalado perfeitamente. Dentro de uma caixa, com fita nas tampas dos produtos para n\u00e3o vazar o conte\u00fado. Chegou dois dias antes do prazo.",
