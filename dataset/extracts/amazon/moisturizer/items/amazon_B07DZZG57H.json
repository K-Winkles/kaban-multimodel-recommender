I have used Kiehls, loccitane, vaseline, shea moisture, nivea, amlactin, cerave, oil in the shower, oil out the shower the list goes on and on and on with the variations I have tried. I ended up making my own lotion because nothing would leave my skin moisturized from sun up to sun down. But this stuff right here, it is AMAZING. I am moisturized, soft, and supple all day long. I do not even have to layer moisturizers, I can use this all on it's own and my skin is *chef's kiss*. I take my shower and while I am still wet, I slather it all over my body. I get out the shower still pretty wet, do my skincare, brush my teeth and when all that is done I rub it in and I am GLOWING! I may look ridiculous standing naked in the bathroom airdrying my lotion but it is 100% worth it. I will say, how I use it only has it only lasting about 2 weeks for me so I end up going through 2-3 bottles a month, it is my 7 year old daughter's favorite lotion too. But $30 a month compared to what I have spent in comparison to other creams is just fine. I will be using this forever, as long ad they make it.",

This product is super for dry skin in winter. Does wonders for my skin - no more dry chapped hands, feet, elbows and arms and legs. Skin feels super soft and smooth. Can\u2019t say enough good things about the quality of this product.",
