Skin is smoother, healthier and brighter, and my face skin looks a bit younger. It\u2019s a light cream, not heavy, has pleasant aroma, and you don\u2019t need to use much to moisturize the face and neck so it lasts longer. It doesn\u2019t work overnight but takes a few weeks or a month to notice the difference but that\u2019s a good thing because you know it\u2019s working deep down into the skin. Highly recommend.",

I've noticed a vast improvement in my skin's appearance since using this product as part of my twice daily skin care routine. My skin is tighter and more lifted after just a few weeks of use. I also love the convenient pump... perfect amount every time! Highly recommend!",

I find the pump container extremely handy, as it dispenses the perfect amount to do my face & neck - no waste!

If I use this alone, I\u2019ll still get the positives of retinol (clearer, smoother skin) but the negatives as well (dryness, peeling.)I like it a lot, and the price is right. But you have to know how to use it properly, and be careful about pairing it with other acids or toners because you could wreck your skin\u2019s natural moisture barrier.",
