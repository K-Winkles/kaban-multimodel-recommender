                "reviewText": "Get it. You won\u2019t regret it.It never feels sticky or tacky. It is fragrance free. It does its job. My skin drinks it in. My hands love it. My feet love it. My elbows love it. It makes my skin feel healthy, nourished, and well-cared for. It\u2019s just luscious. You\u2019ll feel so pampered.I keep a small plain squeeze bottle in my purse and whenever I share it with someone the first thing they say is \u201cOoooooooh what is THIS stuff?\u201dIn my younger days I was a hand model and believe me, I have tried a lot (\u2026a LOT) of lotions over the years. I am VERY picky. I need a daily lotion that isn\u2019t sticky, tacky, waxy, shiny or greasy, and one that my skin actually likes. My go-to has always been Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair. (I still LOVE that one, it\u2019s so great.) Having felt I\u2019d found the perfect formula for my skin, I never thought I\u2019d want to try another brand, let alone switch brands, but I had an opportunity to try this Neutrogena Hydro Boost about 3 years ago - and have been using it ever since! It just feels like the perfect balance of moisture and softness. It absorbs quickly. Apply it anytime. Use as much or as little as your skin needs.. Just, try it one time, you\u2019ll see. . \u2014- I love it. I truly do. \u2014-Plus, it\u2019s \u201cNurtrogena\u201d c\u2019mon. It\u2019s a great brand - and they don\u2019t add dyes, perfumes, or oils.",
