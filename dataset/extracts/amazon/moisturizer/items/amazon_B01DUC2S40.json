                "reviewText": "This is my second face cream - Perricone MD High Potency Classics: Face Finishing & Firming Tinted Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30, and let me tell you, it's become an absolute game-changer in my skincare routine. This is actually my second jar of this marvelous cream, and I cannot help but rave about it.One of the standout features of this tinted moisturizer is its incredible ability to provide intense hydration without leaving my skin feeling greasy or oily. As someone with combination skin, finding a moisturizer that strikes the perfect balance can be quite a challenge. However, Perricone MD has truly mastered the formula here. Upon application, the moisturizer effortlessly glides on my face, melting into my skin with a lightweight, non-greasy texture.The level of hydration this product delivers is outstanding. I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's overall moisture levels since I started using it. Even during the driest seasons, my skin feels plump and supple, as if it's been drenched in a hydrating elixir. It's an incredibly satisfying feeling to know that my skin is being nourished and protected throughout the day.Additionally, the tinted aspect of this moisturizer is an added bonus. The natural, sheer coverage evens out my skin tone beautifully, giving me a healthy, radiant glow. It's the perfect solution for those days when I want to achieve a flawless, dewy complexion without the need for heavy makeup. Plus, the broad-spectrum SPF 30 protection ensures that my skin is shielded from harmful UV rays, which is crucial for maintaining youthful-looking skin.Beyond its moisturizing and tinting properties, the Perricone MD High Potency Classics moisturizer contains an array of beneficial ingredients that are incredibly kind to my skin. Infused with antioxidants, such as alpha lipoic acid and vitamin C ester, it works wonders in promoting a more youthful appearance while protecting against environmental stressors.Lastly, the packaging of this product is both sleek and practical. The 2-ounce jar is travel-friendly, and the design ensures that the cream remains fresh and hygienic throughout its use.In conclusion, I cannot recommend the Perricone MD High Potency Classics: Face Finishing & Firming Tinted Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 enough. It has truly transformed my skincare routine, providing the perfect balance of hydration, sun protection, and a natural, radiant finish. If you're looking for a tinted moisturizer that will leave your skin feeling nourished, without any hint of greasiness, this is the one for you. Prepare to fall in love with your skin all over again!",

                "reviewText": "I did have high hopes for this product! While I really do marginally appreciate the moisturizing aspect of this cream, part of the reason that I bought it was because of the fact it had tinting. I usually use these types of products as a foundation as I don\u2019t like too many things on my skin. I cannot use this for that purpose at all. The tint of it makes me look sallow, ill, and unhealthy in general. I have to put on my other moisturizer which I should\u2019ve just purchased again from Amazon. Maybe one of their other products is better. Recommend if you want to try this product buy it from one of your local stores that actually take returns on beauty items, such as target. I would give it a half star, but I can\u2019t. Buyer beware! This is a very expensive expensive moisturizer to be unhappy with!",

Though they are considered purchases , I have never been let down by any of them . Face finishing and firming tinted moisturiser, is just as written on the box . Out of all their products, this is my favourite! And would be my desert island product.I love it .It is a multi purpose product It gives a healthy subtly tanned , glowing appearance to the skin when applied . It is an amazing anti ageing moisturiser in its own right . It , unlike many tinted products or most foundations , has a 30 factor sunscreen. It is a mineral based one , which is supposed to be healthier. You are advised to at least wear a 30 factor. Though it is not heavy like many foundations, and does not totally cover spots . It gives such a healthy glow that you really do not notice them as you would without using a product . Your face has a luminous dewy look . I use this product , for both day and evenings with no problems. It is particularly good for the day . Once applied , voila ! There is nothing else to apply , because you just applied all needed .",
