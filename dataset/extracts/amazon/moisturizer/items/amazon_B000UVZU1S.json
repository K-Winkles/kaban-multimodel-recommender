Give your skin a daily moisture boost with this facial moisturizer. Made with collagen, elastin and safflower oil, it's safe to use morning and night for smooth, hydrated skin. Now it's easier than ever to nourish your skin with the goodness of 100% natural moisturizers. A lesser known relative of the sunflower, the safflower is a plant with red, yellow and orange flowers. But you shouldn't be deceived by its prickly looking exterior; the plant's oil is known to help to smooth and moisturize skin. Our safflowers come from all over the world, including such countries as Australia and Argentina. The flowers we use are carefully picked and then put through a process which consists of soaking and refining to extract the oil, which is a 100% pure and natural moisturizer too. Youthful skin is always in! This face moisturizer helps renew skin for a beautiful, healthy glow. Collagen and elastin proteins are naturally present in healthy skin. Our nourishing face moisturizer helps you support your body's natural production of these building blocks. To use, apply paraben free face lotion to face and neck, morning and evening \u2014 and give your skin the TLC it deserves.",

                "reviewText": "This is the first time I've ever purchased a product by St. Ives (along with another product in the same package), and so far, I think that it's a good moisturizer and will continue to use until it's gone!It's a sizable product, with the the moisturizer's white cream filling to the top (nearly). It does have a noticeable scent/smell to it when you open it, which isn't unpleasant but it can be a bit much for some. The cream isn't too heavy/thick, but I noticed that you can use a little less and it still covers a good amount of skin area. After applying, I noticed that after about 15-20 minutes, the product gives a smooth feeling on the skin.I've used this for the past few days on my face, neck, hands and arms, and haven't seen any redness, itchiness, oiliness, or odd rashes. I have sensitive/dry skin, so this is a plus that my skin hasn't reacted negatively.Pros: Big tub of moisturizer for only $6-$7, leaves a smooth/soft feeling, cream isn't too heavy, can be used on body/face, no odd skin reactions (so far), and package came undamaged/affected.Cons: The scent might be too much for someone sensitive to smells (and it isn't my favorite) and there was no sealing/cover between the lid and the cream...which means anyone before you could've opened it.Overall, for only $6-$7, I'd give it a try to someone looking for a moisturizer that is affordable, sizable, and satisfactory.",

                "reviewText": "I recently tried the St. Ives Collagen Moisturizer, and it has quickly become my go-to facial moisturizer. Here\u2019s why I highly recommend it: 1. Affordable: One of the standout features of this moisturizer is its affordability. It provides excellent value for the price, making it accessible to everyone without compromising on quality. 2. Like Lotion for Your Face: The consistency of this moisturizer is reminiscent of a lightweight lotion, which makes it incredibly easy to apply. It glides smoothly onto the skin, absorbing quickly without leaving a greasy residue. 3. Great Under Makeup: I was thrilled to find that this moisturizer works perfectly as a base for makeup. It creates a smooth canvas for foundation and helps it glide on effortlessly. No more worrying about makeup caking or sliding off! 4. Softens and Nourishes: The St. Ives Collagen Moisturizer does an excellent job of softening the skin. With regular use, I noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture of my face. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and supple throughout the day. 5. Pleasant Scent and Sleep-Friendly: The moisturizer has a delightful fragrance that is not overpowering. I appreciate how it adds a subtle touch of freshness to my skincare routine. Additionally, its lightweight formula allows me to comfortably wear it overnight without any discomfort. 6. Generous Portion: The product comes in a generous portion, providing long-lasting use. You won\u2019t need to repurchase frequently, making it a budget-friendly option. 7. No Bad Breakouts: I have sensitive skin, but this moisturizer didn\u2019t cause any adverse reactions or breakouts. It\u2019s gentle and suitable for various skin types, ensuring a positive experience for everyone.While I haven\u2019t noticed immediate anti-aging effects comparable to some other brands, such as Olay, the St. Ives Collagen Moisturizer provides long-term benefits for the skin. Consistent use may reveal the collagen\u2019s anti-aging effects gradually.In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the St. Ives Collagen Moisturizer to everyone. It\u2019s affordable, acts like a lotion for your face, works well under makeup, softens and nourishes the skin, has a pleasant scent, and can even be worn overnight. This product delivers on its promises without causing breakouts, making it a fantastic addition to your skincare routine. Give it a try, and you won\u2019t be disappointed!",

Both of us are only wearing basic untinted sunscreen and zero makeup.Sad that stores in the US are no longer carrying it. I realize that I have an advantage of really good skin genes from my mom, and the fact that I moisturize day and night, and I\u2019m not outside all the time, but I still feel like this lotion has helped my skin a ton. I love the subtle scent (I think it\u2019s gardenia?). I love that it\u2019s lightweight, my skin feels hydrated without feeling suffocated.My skin is pretty dang sensitive, so when it\u2019s minorly chapped, this lotion can sting a little but not enough for me to stop using it. Other than that, my skin loves this lotion.In the winter I have to use a little more because I live in the mountain west and it gets really dry here. But other than that, it\u2019s pretty dang awesome.",

Makes me think \u201cthis could be anything\u201d. Not sure if the manufacturers make it that way, or that\u2019s just how this came\u2026That\u2019s really my reason to lower the star rating. Without the the sealer lid it just seems suspect, no?!?Also, I used this (and have in the past) as a substitute Kiehl\u2019s Ultra Moisturizing Cream. When something is 1/10 the price, you have to consider it. This is very close",
