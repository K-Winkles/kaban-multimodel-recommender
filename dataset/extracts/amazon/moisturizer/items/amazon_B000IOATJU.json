                "reviewText": "I love PCA skin but one thing I was nervous about was if these deeply discounted items were real as according to the PCA site- items sold on Amazon are :fake or grossly expired.: NEITHER was the case for silkcoat balm from this seller- I have purchased PCA from my medispa before so I compared the box packing as well as the containers- and it was identical- fonts, densities, color, imprint, box quality etc sealed similarly etc- the product was also good until 11/16 and I will surely run out before end of 2014. I think this product is authentically PCA- I find it hard to believe someone would go to all this trouble and use the quality materials to so closely reproduce packaging for what I consider a pretty obscure brand (while while PCA is well known impostors would probably go for big box brands)- I find it to be authentic- the only problem is going to be breaking it to my aesthetician as she will no longer be making those huge profits off me! (***I purchased about 10 PCA products so you will see similar reviews from me on other products from various sellers as far as authenticity- so far NONE have turned out to be fake).I started using this product after I got a pretty serious TCA peel- it was great- it kept my skim moist without irritating or breaking me out. I use it mainly for after peels or days when I feel extra dry. It is nice without feeling greasy. It is not my everyday moisturizer but I go to it when I need something extra or my skin has received a treatment.",

                "reviewText": "First, I have sensitive acne prone combination very dry skin. I have tried endless face creams and have not had any luck until this PCA Silkcoat Balm. It was recommended to me by my esthetician and I have loved it ever since. It hydrates my skin enough to not make them oily at any time of the day both my very dry cheeks and my normal t-zone. I do put a dry oil on top of this for my cheeks only. I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive acne prone skin.",
