                "reviewText": "I am pleasantly surprised by this product. I am 50 yrs young, going through perimenopause and my facial tone has seen better days.Ok so We all know that stress. Environmental elements can affect your physical, mental, emotional health, especially aging women that don't take care of their older skin. You if don't take care of yourself.I have tried pretty much every skin care regimen that a woman can possibly try. As stated above, I am 50 years old. I still have breakouts from time to time. I have broken red capillaries on my face. I have large poors. I have wrinkles. Don't get me started on finding a great foundation. I haven't found that yet but anyways. I ordered this product and I was not for sure about what to expect just by the pure name of it. LOL but I ordered it along with a couple of the other skin care products from the same brand. And I immediately washed my face and used my little shaver to exfoliate and get rid of the fuzzies and applied everything that I bought including this product and my face felt immediately 10 times better, it was almost kind of instant the redness went away. The appearance of my pores was very minimal. My face looked shiny, kinda rejuvenated. It's not oily, it's really slick. It's very viscous, slimy consistency. There is no smell, it's not grainy, it is whitish in color goes on clear rubs right in it takes a minute for it to dry on your face so it's kind of I wanna say tacky, but after it dries on your face, it feels really smooth and it's almost kinda like it tightens your face when it dries, so that was kind of a nice effect. So when it dries on your face and it tightens like it did, I almost felt like it tightened the pores on my face. So that was a good indication that it was kind of smoothing out the appearance of the large pores that I have.Overall, I would suggest buying this despite the weirdness of it. It's good I have extremely sensitive skin. I have T zone area so I'm part dry part oily. I get a bit of psoriasis or eczema behind my ears or whatever and around my nose and my laugh lines are super sensitive to different products, especially Vitamin C products which I will never buy again. But my face gets Super dry and flaky. And this product did not do that at all. No burn effect either. Exceeded my expectations overall. I'm very happy with my purchase and I will leave reviews for the other products that I bought from this brand on the other pages.",

                "reviewText": "This is an intriguing skincare product, boasting snail mucin as a key ingredient known for its healing and moisturizing properties. Upon application, the cream has a notable lightweight texture, making it suitable for various skin types, including sensitive skin. It absorbs well without leaving a greasy residue, providing a soothing and hydrating effect.However, users with extremely oily or acne-prone skin might need to be cautious, as the rich formulation could potentially lead to breakouts. It's fragrance-free, which is a plus for those sensitive to scents.In terms of hydration and skin repair, this cream shows promising results, especially in improving skin texture and moisture levels. The packaging is practical and hygienic, although some might prefer a more luxurious design.Overall, it's is a solid choice for those seeking deep hydration and skin repair, offering good value for its price. As with any skincare product, results may vary depending on individual skin types and conditions.",

IT.For those who complained about the \u201cslimy\u201d texture\u2026it is snail mucin and to be expected. If you think this will gross you out, I don\u2019t encourage you try it. It\u2019s more like mozzarella cheese in my mind than anything. Super stringy, heavy to the touch, but so lightweight on the face. Non greasy. I read some felt it was sticky. I don\u2019t get that at all as it absorbs so well but still leaves you glowing and soft feeling. I also read some felt it was sticky. I did not get that at all as it absorbs amazingly but leaves me flowing and my face softer to the touch.",

It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving a non-greasy finish, making it suitable for both morning and evening use. The hydration it provides is notable, giving the skin a plump and dewy appearance.The star ingredient, snail mucin, is known for its potential skin-renewing and soothing properties. After consistent use, I did observe a subtle improvement in the overall texture of my skin and a reduction in redness. However, the transformative effects were not as pronounced as I had hoped for, considering the hype surrounding snail mucin in skincare.",

De hecho hasta se redujo much\u00edsimo el brillo producido por la grasa que produce mi piel.
