I have been using off and on for 3 years now - Especially when i have an event coming up in a couple weeks i really get in to it ;) It states it can make your skin look up to 10 years younger within 4 weeks. Some might say i am 'too young' to be using anti-aging product but i feel like this gives me a head start. I usually apply about twice a day - once before bed and once out of shower in the morning - does not feel heavy or greasy.. my skin loves it! Also i saved a few bucks than if i would have purchased in store and it was delivered to my door so cant go wrong there! I wouldn't recommend the one with SPF though as that is mostly what it is. Original is best although i use fragrance free because my skin is sensitive to perfumes. Haven't tried the touch of sun one and don't really feel inclined to either.. when you find something you like you tend to want to stick to it!",
