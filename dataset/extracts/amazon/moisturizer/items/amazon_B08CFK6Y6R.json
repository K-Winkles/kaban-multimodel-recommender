                "reviewText": "I've used this for a few years now. I can't always send a real lot at a time so I love that this comes in a convenient size at an affordable price like this. And Amazon never fails to offer great deals. As far as wrinkles...I don't believe there is truly any miracle product out there, But -i do notice this has helped smooth out my wrinkle lines. It also moisturizes nicely, I have rosacea and this does not cause flair ups in my sensitive skin. In fact some of my meds cause my face skin to become a little dry at times and this product really helps balance it out. The fragrance is definitely not to much at all. It is a very soft scent that I feel only keeps it from smelling stale. After having in for 10 minutes I don't even notice a scent any more and my skin feels silky and fresh. I love this product. For nighttime I wake up feeling fresh skin. And daytime I apply right after shower and wait about 20 min to put on makeup. My wrinkle lines have diminished appearance and my skin is vibrant -not greasy looking.",
