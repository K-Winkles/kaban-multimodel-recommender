                "reviewText": "My Dearest Vanicream,As I sit here, pen in hand, my heart overflows with gratitude for the incredible impact you've had on my skin. You, my gentle giant, have transformed my once-dry, irritated complexion into a haven of hydration and softness.From the moment our paths first crossed, I knew there was something special about you. Your thick, velvety texture, reminiscent of a luxurious whipped cream, enveloped my skin in a comforting embrace. Each application was a soothing balm, easing away the redness and irritation that had plagued me for so long.I was particularly smitten with your willingness to accompany me on my journey with tretinoin, the notorious skin-saviour known for its sometimes-harsh side effects. With you by my side, the dreaded tretinoin-induced dryness and flakiness were nowhere to be found. Instead, my skin remained supple, nourished, and free from irritation.Your effectiveness extends far beyond the realm of tretinoin-induced dryness. Whether I'm battling the harsh winter winds or the parched air of central heating, you stand as my faithful ally, replenishing my skin's moisture and restoring its natural glow.Oh, how I adore your fragrance-free nature, a gentle touch that soothes my sensitive skin without the overwhelming assault of perfumes and artificial scents. You understand that true beauty lies in simplicity and purity, and your delicate, yet effective formula embodies this philosophy perfectly.My love for you, Vanicream, knows no bounds. You are my skin's confidante, its protector, and its most ardent admirer. I will forever cherish the day we met, and I eagerly anticipate the countless days of radiant, hydrated skin that lie ahead.With all my love,A Devoted Admirer*****UPDATE*****Fool that I am, I decided to try a different night moisturizer from a very popular brand. HUGE MISTAKE. I woke up the following morning with flaky skin by my mouth and around my eyes. It made so many promises that I was temporarily wooed. That period has ended. I eighty-sixed the new cream and returned to Vanicream. Two days later, and the flakes have ceased and my barrier is in tact. LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff.",

                "reviewText": "Bought the face wash/body wash/body cream bundle to try after loving the shampoo, conditioner and face moisturizer by this brand so much.Face wash: So amazingly gentle and luscious-feeling. You only need one pump for face and neck and it is still almost too much! Very rich but doesn't break me out. I'm coming from a very exfoliating cleanser and was worried this wouldn't be enough for my skin but it feels great. No fragrance and beautiful pearlescent color. I seem to have less redness in my face, too.Body wash: Same as above - use much less than you think you need, to start! Very lush and gentle. Suds up A LOT! Also no fragrance and same beautiful pearlescent color. Doesn't feel drying at all.Body cream: I would technically probably give this one four stars. It's JUST hydrating enough for my bone-dry skin (in summer - we'll see how it holds up in winter), and absorbs pretty quickly with no stickiness after about 20 minutes or so. The very first time I used it, I detected a slightly unpleasant smell that I cannot begin to describe. The body cream I was using before this was Bioderma Intensive Baume. It is truly unscented, hydrates amazingly well BUT leaves me sticky for hours which is quite unpleasant, hence me shopping around. I may still switch back and forth between both depending on my needs that day.",
