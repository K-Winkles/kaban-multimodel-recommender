                "reviewText": "I really wanted to purchase a really nice moisturizer for myself as a man and wanted something beyond the usual suspects. I saw this and thought, is this really good and second isa ti worth the price. The reality is yes to both.The smell is not overwhelming at all, but is very pleasant and very masculine (but it is not also a musk smell). The lotion itself feels really great and is not oily. The lotion appears to be very high quality. After a few times using this I can already notice my skin becoming softer, so it appears to work well.Great product! Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this for about two years and am on my second bottle. Great scent, non-greasy. Although I had no issues with the pump when used normally, I see the new pump is beefier overall and the pickup tube is bigger for the pump hammerers. Great product. I'm sure you can find something cheaper, but for the quality and scent, I pay the toll.The scent smells kind of like aftershave, but the good kind us young hot guys buy, not the old man smell like Old Spice. You can smell it when you put your nose on your arm/face, but it's not overpowering once dry so it doesn't mess with cologne or body spray you may have on.Between this and SitFresh you will irresistible unless doomed from birth.",
