I have t-zone oily/ combination skin and I only use a little dab (morning and night). It seriously covers my whole face. Since it's a gel, you do have to be mindful not to use too much or it may clog your pores more. I pair it with a light moisturizer cream for my spf and to lock in the gel moisturizer agent, and my skin is so soft. Hoping they don't discontinue this ever!",

I know with inflation and everything that's bound to happen but when I first starting buying this about a year ago it was \u00a311 but is now \u00a316 so hard to justify to keep buying even though I love it.",
