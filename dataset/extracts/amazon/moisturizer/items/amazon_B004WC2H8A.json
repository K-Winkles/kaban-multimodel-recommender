                "reviewText": "I have had eczema on my face, neck, arms, and legs for the past 15 years, and have relied heavily on hydrocortisone creams to keep it under control. Every so often, since I was concerned about the effects of the hydrocortisone on my body, I would try to switch to a \"hypoallergenic\" lotion from a brand such as Eucerin (including aquaphor), Neosporin, or Aveeno. These tended to make my skin flare up and become extremely itchy or swollen, left my skin oily and pimply, or just left my skin dry. I have gone to multiple doctors, and none have been able to offer a solution that worked, other than the hydrocortisone cream/ointment. Though they did suggest using body oil, I do not like the feeling of oil on my skin.Since my husband and I are considering starting a family, I really wanted to stop using the hydrocortisone cream (which is a steroid cream), in case it has any ill effects on the baby during pregnancy. After tons of searching, I finally found this repair cream, read the reviews, and thought I would give it a try. For the first few days of using it, my skin still felt a little itchy and red, though I think this was an effect of getting off the hydrocortisone cream (which seems to have addictive affects), but after that, my skin has drastically reduced in redness and rawness, lost its itchiness, and has become smooth, soft, and resilient (as opposed to the fragile, papery feeling it had with hydrocortisone creams). It really feels like a miracle, after struggling with eczema for so long. This product, coupled with vaseline lip therapy for my lips (it's plain, but it works), has really turned my skin around. I have now purchased the larger pot of the FAB Ultra Repair Cream, and can't be happier with the product.I have also started using a free sample of the FAB Facial Radiance Pads. I have only been using it for a few days, so I don't know how my skin will react to it in the long-term, but thus far (in spite of the pad's strong herbal smell), they seem to be working. I only use one at night, and I wake up with glow-y, silky, moisturized skin (even though I don't put on the cream after I use the pad). This is amazing for someone who has dealt with eczema forever, and is used to waking up with flaking, itchy skin.One thing to remember, it is also really important to make sure your allergies are under control! If I'm in an environment with a lot of dust, pollen, dander, mold, or other allergens, my skin immediately acts up, regardless of what products I use. Make sure you keep your living environment clean, or take something to keep your allergies in check.",
