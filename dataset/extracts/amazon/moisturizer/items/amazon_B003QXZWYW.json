                "reviewText": "As someone who struggles with extremely dry skin, finding the right body lotion has been a game-changer, and La Roche-Posay Lipikar Balm AP+ Intense Repair Body Lotion is truly a lifesaver. This lotion goes above and beyond in providing intense hydration and repair for dry, irritated skin. From the moment I started using it, I noticed a significant improvement in the texture and moisture level of my skin. The rich, creamy formula absorbs quickly and deeply, leaving my skin feeling soft, supple, and nourished without any greasy residue.What sets this product apart is its effectiveness in addressing the needs of sensitive and dry skin. It's formulated with ingredients that soothe and replenish, making it suitable for even the most delicate skin types. Plus, it's fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for those with sensitivities to scents.The price point for this product is also incredibly reasonable considering the quality and effectiveness. A little goes a long way, so a single bottle lasts a while, making it a cost-effective investment in my skincare routine.As an Accutane patient, finding products that provide relief from dryness and sensitivity is crucial, and La Roche-Posay Lipikar Balm AP+ Intense Repair Body Lotion has become a staple in my regimen. It's a product I can rely on day in and day out to keep my skin healthy, hydrated, and comfortable. If you're struggling with dry, sensitive skin, I highly recommend giving this body lotion a try. It's a true powerhouse when it comes to intense repair and hydration, and it's been a game-changer for me on my skincare journey.",

                "reviewText": "I am delighted with this moisturizing cream, it works for the whole body but I decided to use it on my face. I don't know why it took me so long to do it. The results I have obtained after 2 weeks of use are incredible. My skin is totally hydrated and without irritation now that It's winter and it's going great for me. I hope it's the same in spring. I have oily and sensitive skin at the same time and this is by far the best moisturizing cream I've ever used. In relation to the price, I think it's very supportive and affordable for anyone. 400ml is enough. to cover several months in short super recommendedsoft textureit is not greasyhas an imperceptible smell",

                "reviewText": "I really like this lotion and have been using as my face lotion for a while now. I have combination skin and I feel that it doesn't make my skin too oily but also works well to moisturize the dry areas. It's also good for use on the body, even though I don't use it that way. It's good for sensitive skin as it doesn't have any strong fragrances. The only complaint I have is that when it's almost used up, it's really hard to get the rest of the lotion out as it is pretty thick and sticks to the bottom. I might have to cut the bottle in half to get the rest of it.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this, the wash, and an eye cream and it was my first time using this brand and oh my gosh where has this been my whole life?!! This is so moisturizing (but not greasy or gross) and soothing! I\u2019ve recently developed very sensitive and reactive skin so even products I\u2019ve used for years tend to cause problems- from a slight itchy feeling to full blown contact dermatitis rashes. I had been so frustrated trying to find something that not only doesn\u2019t cause my skin to react but also moisturizes my dry winter ravaged skin but this is a winner! No itchiness, no redness, no sticky feeling AND it healed any flaky dry patches. I mainly use it on body and hands but it provides a nice \u201coomph\u201d of moisture for my face when I need it. There\u2019s no noticeable scent so it won\u2019t interfere with perfume and it shouldn\u2019t be a problem for people who are sensitive to scents!BOTTOM LINE: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

                "reviewText": "Okay, so I\u2019ve been using this La Roche-Posay Lipikar Balm AP+ lotion on my super dry and itchy legs, and let me tell you, it\u2019s a game-changer! It seriously soothes my skin and the itchiness is just gone. Plus, it doesn\u2019t leave that greasy feeling, which I totally love.But, the bottle is kind of a nightmare. The cream is so thick that getting it out with the pump is like a mini workout session. I usually end up unscrewing the cap to get to the lotion, especially when it starts running low but still has a lot of product in it. It\u2019s pretty annoying and feels like I\u2019m wasting a bunch of it. I wish they\u2019d just put it in a tube or a jar. That would make life so much easier.So, yeah, the lotion itself is awesome for dry, itchy skin, but they really need to rethink that bottle!",
