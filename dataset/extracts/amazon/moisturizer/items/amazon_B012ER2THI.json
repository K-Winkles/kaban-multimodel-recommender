I took him for an acne clearing facial and the aesthetician recommended the Dermatologica Clear Start products got him. They are at a moddrate price point but in this economy I know that might be hard for some people; but they (and this moisturizer) are definitely worth it. He started using just this moisturizer and the Clear Start face wash and within 2 weeks his skin and the acne were radically improved. We added the spot treatment for the stubborn more cystic spots and he looks fantastic. I highly recommend this moisturizer and the one with SPF in the summer if you have acne prone skin.",

I had long ago given up looking for the magic bullet, but after a recent stress-induced break out, looked around for what might be new on the market. I stumbled upon this lotion (and toner), and decided to give it a try. I initially was dismayed at how oily it felt when I put it on the first time, but that oiliness quickly went away, and my skin was left feeling very pleasantly moisturized. I've been using it in combination with the toner, and have been extremely pleased. My skin will never be perfect, but I definitely think these products have reduced my problems pretty significantly.I should also mention that a little goes a long way. Just a little pea-sized dollop goes a long way.",
