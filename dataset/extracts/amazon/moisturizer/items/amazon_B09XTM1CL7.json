I will say the pump packaging is a bit cheap and feels like it could break.The moisturizer is unscented, no frills, and effective. It isn\u2019t a super rich cream, but rich enough for day or night. For me, it is not quite heavy enough for PM for winter skin; I am using for AM. But in summer, it will be a good PM cream.It really does hydrate my dry skin (I have dry skin and use Tretinoin and other actives). It feels plump when I use it. No irritation at all. It is calming and soothing and an enjoyable experience to use. It doesn\u2019t feel cheap. It maybe reminds me of the nice Cetaphil moisturizers like deep hydration line.It is a steal though with so much product at a reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "To start off, I have very dry, sensitive, eczema, and acne prone skin. I also live in very dry climate, so that really dries me out more. I\u2019ve tried many moisturizers and I\u2019ve also tried a few Korean moisturizers. Most moisturizers either tend to break me out, are simply not hydrating enough, or burn/sting around my nose/mouth area. This moisturizer does none of that. I\u2019ve been using it now off and on for 5 months. I tried using other Korean moisturizers during that time but many of those for some reason caused an allergic reaction. Mainly very bad itching and of course breakouts. I kept going back to this Purito moisturizer. When applying, it does go on a little streaky on me, but as I rub in, it absorbs nicely and gives a nice glow to my skin. It doesn\u2019t smell like anything. I love that this moisturizer doesn\u2019t have niacinamide or hyaluronic acid in it. Those do not agree with my skin at all and it\u2019s hard to find products these days that don\u2019t have those ingredients. This moisturizer does have 5 different ceramides in it as well. Which is amazing! Many moisturizers that advertise to be a ceramide moisturizer, sometimes only contain one ceramide. Overall, this is an amazing moisturizer. I hope Purito keeps this around forever and doesn\u2019t change the ingredient list. It\u2019s perfect the way it is! Thank you Purito!! I hope you like this moisturizer if you give it a try!",

I love the airless pump design and the fact that one pump can cover my whole face. It has no fragrance and does not leave my skin greasy. The only reason why I removed a star is due to the fact that after one week of use no product would dispense. I had to look up online about airless pumps and found that you have to hit the bottom and depress the top upside down to get it to move properly. Once I did this, the product now dispenses as normal. I would definitely repurchase the product.",

                "reviewText": "I have no idea what I did to my under eyes but for a month I was dealing with an absolute mess under them and everything burned, they were swollen and red, looked like I aged 10 years and couldn't wear any makeup lmao I was so mad. I started putting this on in the morning and night with aquaphor over it and 3 days later it cleared up and it's been good since. Looks like nothing ever happened.If my skin barrier feels irritated like that burning sensation, I'll use this and it's so calming and gentle. Love it.Absolutely no scent, it's pretty thick textured but is not heavy or greasy at all, I can use it under makeup and sunscreen. Little goes far. I purchased it as a last effort to try and not need to take time off of work to go see the dr and glad I did, its something I'd definitely like to buy again when it runs out",

My skin has been so dry, I really put it through some stuff with tretinoin and in two days it\u2019s plumped up like I never thought possible. This is so hydrating and everything I need. It is rich and I wasn\u2019t sure if I could wear it under make up but I just put a little less on and it gave the most beautiful makeup base. There is no scent at all which I really appreciate. 10000000 stars if I could",
