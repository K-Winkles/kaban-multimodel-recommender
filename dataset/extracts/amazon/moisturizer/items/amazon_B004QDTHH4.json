I am still using it now. After I started getting at one of the samples I received from DHC was the Rich Moisture cream. It is light, unscented & absorbs quickly,. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized without being greasy. I use it before putting on my makeup and again after washing my face at night. I have a couple of different night creams that I use and like, however regular use of this leaves me feeling like I don\u2019t need them very often.",
