                "reviewText": "It\u2019s my first time trying this so I wasn\u2019t too sure what to expect, but I do love the tube pump applicator that makes applying the cream easy and able to be stored upright on your counter. The cream itself has a neutral scent and nice texture of not too thick or too runny. A small amount seems to spread a long way. It goes on smooth and is quickly absorbed (I have dry dull skin), it can be layered underneath or over other products without clogging pores or leaving your skin greasy. I\u2019ve been using it for about two weeks in the morning and evening, and have noticed my skin feels a little softer & smoother. My skin is still \u201cdull\u201d but figure long term use may improve those results. Overall, you can\u2019t beat the $8 price tag for a gentle facial moisturizer that will hydrate, firm and moisturize dry skin without weighing it down. The only thing that surprised me was the lack of any SPF protection from the sun. Highly recommend 5-Stars!",

                "reviewText": "I recently tried the e.l.f. SKIN Daily Hydration moisturizer, and I must say, it has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine. This product claims to provide deep hydration while nourishing and soothing the skin, and I can confidently say that it lives up to those claims.First and foremost, the texture of the moisturizer is fantastic. It's lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving behind no greasy or heavy residue. This makes it perfect for both daytime and nighttime use. I appreciate how it effortlessly glides onto my skin, instantly quenching any dryness or tightness.The hydration this moisturizer provides is truly impressive. Within minutes of application, my skin feels noticeably more moisturized and supple. The formula is enriched with ingredients like hyaluronic acid, a powerful humectant that helps retain moisture, and aloe vera, known for its soothing properties. I have noticed a significant improvement in the overall plumpness and smoothness of my skin since incorporating this moisturizer into my routine.One of the standout features of the e.l.f. SKIN Daily Hydration is its compatibility with various skin types. I have combination skin, and this moisturizer strikes the perfect balance. It hydrates my drier areas without causing excess oiliness in my T-zone. I appreciate that it doesn't clog my pores or cause any breakouts, which is a common concern for me when trying new skincare products.Additionally, I applaud e.l.f. for their commitment to clean and cruelty-free beauty. The e.l.f. SKIN Daily Hydration is free from parabens, sulfates, phthalates, and synthetic fragrances. Knowing that I'm using a product that is both effective and ethically produced adds to my overall satisfaction.In terms of packaging, the e.l.f. SKIN Daily Hydration comes in a sleek, convenient pump bottle. It's hygienic and makes it easy to dispense the right amount of product without any waste. The compact size also makes it travel-friendly, allowing me to maintain my skincare routine on the go.Overall, I highly recommend the e.l.f. SKIN Daily Hydration moisturizer. Its lightweight texture, impressive hydration, and compatibility with different skin types make it a standout product. If you're looking for a reliable and affordable moisturizer that delivers on its promises, give this one a try. Your skin will thank you!",

This dynamic duo made my skin look supple, and I would say it cleared up most of the little bumps on my forehead (iykyk). For anyone going through their skincare journey, I hope you achieve what you dream for your skin and find something that works for you! This definitely works for me.",

After I've finished my first tube, it wasn't in stock at my local Walmart, so I tried the white bottle ELF moisturizer instead, but I didn't like it as much. Since I repurchased this one, I decided I'll stick with it, because it's just so good. My skin and I missed it!This moisturizer is thick but smooth. It sinks right into the skin, leaving it soft and bouncy. It's great before makeup. I have dry spots and texture and I feel like it's just the right amount of hydration to prep my skin. It has a nice subtle fresh scent that doesn't linger nor irritate the skin. I recommend it!",
