I noticed my skin looks brighter, has less discoloration and an and overall firmer look. The lines around my mouth appear less noticeable and I see a smoother look as well. It absorbs very well and wears nicely underneath my makeup. It's the summertime now, so I will be interested to see if it is moisturizing enough in the winter. I will continue to use this product and the price is right as well.",

The day it arrived I was disappointed because the jar had an area that did not get filled with the product during production and I wrote about that in my original review. At that time, I had not even used the product yet. The seller has shown beyond any doubt that they care a great deal regarding their customer's satisfaction. Now that I've been using the product for a few weeks; I find the benefits of this moisturizer are surprising. After the first week, my skin was clearly looking more youthful and hydrated. A small amount of this product goes a long way. It is very light feeling... not like some moisturizers that feel like I'm wearing a mask all over my face. And this product has no smell, as some others often have. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality face moisturizer.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Overall this is a decent product. I've been using it for a couple weeks now and the results are so so. Definitely not as good as the brand name cream but not the worst either. I use it at night and the one thing I've noticed is that the longer it stays on, the more noticeable the results are. I can definitely tell the difference between nights that I use it and nights that I don't. It's very easy to apply and doesn't leave a film on my face. The cream is easily absorbed and has no fragrance which is a plus but is that enough for me to purchase this product again? I don't like the deceptive marketing tactics used by suggesting this is a product made in America. If it's not then there's no reason to mention another countries name in the description unless there's significant reason to. Although that has no effect on the products quality, it does turn people off from purchasing that item whereas they would've bought it if the seller was honest and upfront about what they're selling. Because I am one of those shoppers, I will not be purchasing from this seller again. This doesn't mean you, the potential buyer shouldn't. We all have the freedom to do as we so choose. I'm giving three stars because A. The seller was deceptive and B. This face cream is okay.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This face cream is one of the best purchases I've ever made - it's affordable, lightweight, fragrance-free, and it really does hydrate my skin! When I put it on at night, I can still feel the effects of it the next morning. Same goes for when I put it on in the morning - it continues to moisturize throughout the day!Additionally, I have very sensitive skin and this cream doesn't cause any irritation whatsoever. Huge win for me!When it first arrived, I read the directions and thought to myself, 'What exactly is a \"proper amount\" of cream to put on?'So I unscrewed the cap as I would with any other cream and just tried to guess. But then I saw that strange cone under the cap itself, so I screwed it back on.That's when I realized that I only needed to take the clear cap off, press down, and the \"proper amount\" would be dispensed for me, taking all the guesswork out of the equation (see enclosed pictures and video).I highly recommend that you stop reading reviews for any other product, for you've already found the perfect retinol face cream (with a fully functional \"proper amount\" cream dispenser!).",
