My skin appears to be brighter and the texture is much smoother. I will definitely purchase this product again. Brickell never seems to fail.",

I've only been using it a couple of weeks, so we'll see what the results are after continued use, but so far I'm a fan!",

This refreshing gel glides on smoothly, and you can practically feel your skin saying, \"Ah, thanks for the love!\" It's also not greasy, which is a big win in my book.Now, the scent is subtle but oh-so-nice. It's like a slight hint of freshness without going overboard. So, if you're not into overpowering fragrances, this one's a winner.But the real magic? It's the anti-aging mojo it's got going on. Fine lines? See ya! It's got this mix of powerful ingredients that are like little warriors fighting the signs of aging. I'm not saying it turned back time, but my skin feels more alive and, dare I say, a bit younger.And can we talk about the packaging? Sleek and simple. I appreciate a product that doesn't scream for attention but delivers where it counts.So, if you're looking for a solid anti-aging moisturizer that doesn't mess around, give this Brickell product a shot. Your face will thank you!",

                "reviewText": "I am a fan of Brickell products and use many of them. This one I have recently tried and it shows results. It has a great fragrence, it goes on light, keeps the skin cool, and shows reduction in fine lines around the eyes. It works great as a moisturizer showing immediate impact on the skin surface. It also does not require a large amoutn of product to cover your face. Highly reccommend trying this one if you have not !",
