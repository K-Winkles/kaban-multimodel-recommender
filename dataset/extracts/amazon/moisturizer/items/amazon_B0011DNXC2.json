And Amazon never fails to offer great deals. As far as wrinkles...I don't believe there is truly any miracle product out there, But -i do notice this has helped smooth out my wrinkle lines. It also moisturizes nicely, I have rosacea and this does not cause flair ups in my sensitive skin. In fact some of my meds cause my face skin to become a little dry at times and this product really helps balance it out. The fragrance is definitely not to much at all. It is a very soft scent that I feel only keeps it from smelling stale. After having in for 10 minutes I don't even notice a scent any more and my skin feels silky and fresh. I love this product. For nighttime I wake up feeling fresh skin. And daytime I apply right after shower and wait about 20 min to put on makeup. My wrinkle lines have diminished appearance and my skin is vibrant -not greasy looking.",
