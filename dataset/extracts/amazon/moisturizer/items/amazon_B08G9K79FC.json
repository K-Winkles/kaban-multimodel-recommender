Yes, you may have noticed that we have updated our packaging to showcase our new & improved formula with Pro-Ceramide. This exciting change reflects our commitment to delivering high-quality products. You may receive either design. Did Lubriderm change their formulas? Yes, Lubriderm has made some exciting changes to enhance our products! We have improved our formulas including the addition of Pro-Ceramide, but don\u2019t worry-our lotions are still fast-absorbing with a clean, non-greasy feel. What is Pro-Ceramide and why is it important? Pro-Ceramide has been shown to penetrate within skin\u2019s surface layers and help support your skin\u2019s natural Ceramide levels. Ceramides play a role in helping maintain a healthy moisture barrier which helps retain moisture within your skin\u2019s surface. Is Lubriderm lotion safe for use on tattoos? Experts recommend using a water-based lotion to hydrate tattooed skin. Lubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion Fragrance Free is a gentle, water-based, unscented lotion that quickly absorbs and moisturizes for healthy-looking skin. Which Lubriderm lotion is best for winter skin? Dry, winter air coupled with heat indoors can lead to very dry skin. Intensely moisturizing products such as Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Moisturizing Cream Fragrance-Free replenish extra dry skin and help to restore your skin's moisture barrier.",

One of the best features of this moisturizer is how well it keeps my skin hydrated and glowing. Even after a long day, my skin still looks and feels soft and supple thanks to this product.What I appreciate most about this moisturizer is the fact that it's fragrance-free. I can apply it to my skin without worrying about any scent interfering with my perfume, and it's also gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin without any irritation.The formula itself is lightweight and absorbs quickly into my skin, so I never feel greasy or weighed down after applying it. Plus, a little goes a long way, so this bottle lasts me for quite some time.Overall, I highly recommend this Lubriderm moisturizer to anyone looking for a high-quality product that keeps skin hydrated and healthy. Its fragrance-free formula is a standout feature, and the lightweight formula makes it easy to use on a daily basis. Thanks to this moisturizer, my skin has never looked or felt better!",
