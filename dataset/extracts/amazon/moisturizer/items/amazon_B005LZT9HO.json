In the day I mix it with my Roc day cream. I would not recommend for oily problem skin though. 10 Years ago this would have been to much moisture for my combination skin. But when I use it my skin just feels amazing.Some may find it too thick for their skin type. I love the consistency. It does not leave my skin sticky or oily. Some reviewers also complained about the smell. It's very pleasant to me and smells like berries. I don't see how this smell could be offensive. But to each his own.What's it's doing on a cellular level for my skin, It's just too early to tell. Sometimes you don't notice how good or bad a product is working until you stop using it.Con: the jar was not filled all the way, and it didn't seem like 2 ounces. But I will continue to use it until it's finished. Then I will decide if I want to continue using it, and try some other eminence products. Just for the way it makes my skin feel, I would definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I happened upon this product on vacation and tried some of the \"tester\". Later that evening i could still feel the \"moist\" but not oily feeling.I'm very picky about face moisturizer and have never found one i even liked. Ill buy one to try and for whatever reason it doesn't meet my expectations and rots on the shelf until my next product purge.I was flying and didn't feel like throwing away $ at tsa so i waiting until i was home. I thought about it several times over the next 2 weeks trying to decide if my starting \"crows feet\" were worth throwing away more money on a moisturizer. This isn't a cheap product so it took me some time to convince myself to try it.I finally ordered it. Im very happy i did. I actually want to wash my face to use it. You can feel the tightness without the itchy pulled feeling. My face feels \"protected\" from pollution and wind but i don't feel \"sweaty\" or oily or shiny like i experience with other products. I wash my face and reapply at night and i wake up feeling clean. When im out hiking my eyes don't burn when i sweat. I can sweat right through it without feeling \"clogged\".A little goes a long way. I have faith this product will last me a while making the price a muted point. Good products are worth more money. But not all expensive products are good products. If you have been \"burned\" by other expensive products i highly recommend you to give this a try.",
