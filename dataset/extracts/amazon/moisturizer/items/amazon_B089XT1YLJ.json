Works almost like foundation, without the pigment matching/pore clogging concerns that have dogged me in the past. For younger folks I'd definitely recommend, especially if you're using foundation primarily to control shine.",

I use it alongside the Purity cleanser, they both smell lovely, not overpowering. I would definitely recommended giving both products a try if you have very dry skin.",
