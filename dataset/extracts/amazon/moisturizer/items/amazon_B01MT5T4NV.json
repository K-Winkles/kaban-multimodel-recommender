        "description": "Priscilla is a tease, flirting with every man she meets. When her mother catches her with Dan, a dockhand, Priscilla accuses the man of attacking her, resulting in a shoot out from which he's left for dead. However, Dan is quickly rescued by two women, who put him to work at an all male brothel with an exclusively female clientele. Becoming fast friends with the other 'studs', Dan soon finds a new home, that is, until he's warned about the notorious 'nutcracker'.Acclaimed filmmaker Alex deRenzy's dark social satire, BABYFACE, remains one of the director's most controversial and often censored films. Featuring an all star cast, including Amber Hunt and Paul Thomas, as well as a haunting performance from Molly Seagrim, Vinegar Syndrome brings this landmark film to Blu-ray, fully uncut and restored from long lost 35mm vault elements.Bonus Features:1. Scanned and restored in 2k from 35mm vault elements2. Extensive audio interview with actress Molly Seagrim3. \"Parochial Passion Princess\" a short film by Alex deRenzy4. Reversible cover artwork",

                "reviewText": "The most interesting thing on the DVD wasn\u2019t the flick. It was the amazing audio interview of Molly Seagrim. I never was certain who \u201cBabyface\u201d was supposed to be, as none of the women had one. I kept waiting for her to be named or for someone with a baby face to appear. I suppose it was the bad girl lying (adult) teenager. What gets me about these films is the plotless, meandering scenarios of monotonous, pumping, licking, and sucking. So intense! In this film, the shaved pussy was just plain weird. The only reason this one gets 3 stars is because of the cinematography. I mean, I left the room for a few minutes to do something without pausing the film and missed nothing. There is a message at the beginning of the film apologizing that a part of the film is missing and hoping that would be okay, but I frankly couldn\u2019t tell anything was missing.",

                "reviewText": "Restored from a 35mm print tells you it was made with professional equipment. The result is near pristine, with minor problems along the edge of portions of reel 5, the Nutcracker scene, which does not detract from the film, nor is it very long. The problems come from damage to reel 5, which, as computer technology progresses, could probably be easily corrected in the near future. Probably wouldn't be a problem now for ILM or WETA. For a film made in 1977 the clarity of the restoration is incredible.There is something for almost everybody with the scenes depicted. This film is a classic, and it is too bad that some critics fail to understand when it was made, and how groundbreaking it was, not to mention how dangerous it was to try and distribute and produce it. Legal issues at the time in many states made films like this difficult to distribute. The theaters which showed these type of films had patrons often with their own raincoats taken into the theater.The plot and script are Academy Award material -- just joking. At least there is a plot, even if one may not buy into it. In the interview with Molly Seagrim, who played the 'Nutcracker,' her notes were that the movie was hackneyed. The interview is audio only.There is a short feature by de Renzy, Parochial Passion Princess, and I give it a 'yawn'. But in one of the last scenes, she is paid by check for her 'service'. Really, a check? That is laughable! And, the amount is indicated, which in itself is fascinating. Remember, this was the 70's.For those interested in the golden age of adult movies, which really encompasses the 1970's, this is a must. de Renzy won the Adult Film Association of America Award in 1977 for Best Director for \"Babyface.\"",
