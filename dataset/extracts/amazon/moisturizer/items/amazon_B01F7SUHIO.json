I had skin cancer in my 30s and I've been super careful with sun exposure since then. This feels excellent and I trust L'Oreal as far as the spf even though I never push my luck by staying out long with the sun on my face. The most pleasant thing is that my face is not shiny. All the other brands have forced me to put on loose face powder after I put on moisturizer to hide the shine. After this, I put a tiny bit of powder on my nose, but I could get away with not doing that. Super pleased with this. No other product did this. Thanks L'Oreal!",

                "reviewText": "I love that is has glycolic acid & SPF and it doesn't feel like sunscreen. I was using Pacifica glow baby since it has glycolic acid, but it doesn't include SPF. I was also using Olay night cream but it doesn't have glycolic acid and if I used my other serum in the morning after olay, my face would be a little red from irritation. But THIS stuff..... This stuff has everything that I'm looking for in a serum and I love the way it feels and looks on my skin. it is also the most affordable product that I have seen that includes the ingredients that I look for. So glad I found this! I know everyone has different skin types, and some are more sensitive than others, but this seems to be working for me. If you are trying different products it wouldn't hurt to try this.",
