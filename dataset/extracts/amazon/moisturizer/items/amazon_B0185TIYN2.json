                "reviewText": "I have quite a few tuners and this one is my favorite by far because it shows every pitch detail including vibrato. I got the paid one (under $5) for my Galaxy s5 phone and it only requires microphone permission. I also really love that I can record and then play back and see exactly what was happening with each note.I'm a flute player and I've started performing again on account of this app. I just memorize the song and then watch the tuner as I play to be sure that I'm in tune. I may not be perfect, but I'm definitely good enough for folks to enjoy my playing. I performed a Bach sonata at church last Sunday and played along with a music minus one keyboard recording. So, many thanks to the developer of this app.If you are interested in how I played along with the mmo recording...I run a speaker/amp into the headphone jack on my phone. I play the mmo recording which goes out to the speaker... then switch over to the tuner while the song is playing.",
