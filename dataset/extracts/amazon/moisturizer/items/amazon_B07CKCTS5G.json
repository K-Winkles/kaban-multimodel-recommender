                "reviewText": "This is my favorite Hempz scent so far. Been using the lotion for a few months during my pregnancy and it treats my bump well post-shower! It's got a wonderful fresh citrusy scent and doesn't smell super artificial or cloying to me. My only minor gripe is that it's very thick and condensed, almost hard to spread if your skin is quite dry (but that's also kind of a nice value thing, the formula definitely isn't watered down). I just wet my hands and skin, then grab a pump and spread it over the area. Makes it way easier to distribute and it dries more silky without an oily finish. My fiance and I have been using it daily for 3+ months and are almost halfway into the bottle. I'm pretty happy with it!",
