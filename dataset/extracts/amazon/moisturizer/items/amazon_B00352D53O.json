I\u2019ve been using it for a few of years now, and I can tell a difference in my skin even overnight after one use.I have VERY sensitive and angry skin (my skin is considered \u201ccombination\u201d, as well as veryyy acne-prone. I also have a skin condition called dermotographia)This product goes a long way; you only have to use a small amount to cover your face/neck areas. The lotion absorbs completely very quickly, and has an extremely light and pleasant scent.The only caveat is that there\u2019s not UV protection. It would be a wonderful addition to include a version with SPF. Other than that, it\u2019s a perfect product, in my opinion. I hope it works as well for you as it has for me.",

It instantly absorbs into the skin and leaves you feeling stick-free and hydrated. The scent is a neutral one\u2014 all great and non-irritating skincare products are non-scented, which is why you know this one is the best thing for your skin. I recently ordered another bottle, and I got a free lip gloss and serum with a hand written note, thanking me for my loyalty to their product. The Air Repair team values you as a customer and seem to truly care about you and the wellbeing of your skin. I\u2019d definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for amazing skin while using a responsibly made product.",

                "reviewText": "I received a sample of this through a beauty subscription & fell in love with it! So I ordered a bottle! it's a great, non greasy lightweight moisturizer, exactly the same as the sample I received through my subscription as far as I can tell. I have oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin. This moisturizer doesn't make me any more or less oily, nor does it irritate my skin, it rather soothes skin from the chemicals in my RX acne creams & from sun/wind burn. It also doesn't clog pores or cause any breakouts, which is rare for me! I use it every night following my acne cream, been using for about four months now with no issues. It goes a long way as well, so the small bottle can last me three months easily. A small pea sized amount covers my entire face and neck!Having hyaluronic acid in it is just a plus. If you don't know the benefits of hyaluronic acid, Google it & be amazed! it's a wonderful addition & great for your skin.10/10 would recommend! The formulation is perfect for me & the added benefits of hyaluronic acid make it an incredible product that I plan on using until I die or it's discontinued, which will force me to stock up on it before it's gone!",

It fully absorbs into skin and doesn't leave skin with a dew or grease feeling like many other face creams. I wish it had retinol in it, as some people say retinol is good for fine lines/wrinkles, but it has many natural ingredients that combat fine lines.",

The seller done an excellent job at making it right and I have to say it was wonderful. I love the silky feeling and how hydrating it is with no heavy waxy feel its light and I use it on my neck also. I have rosacea and I cant use certain creams and this is wonderful and does not break me out. I would recommend and if you have skin issues I feel this would be great for all types and to me it smells like a vitamin c cream it's not strong at all!! I use expensive creams for my whole face neck and eyes and I really love this product and cant wait to post future progress. To be continued.",
