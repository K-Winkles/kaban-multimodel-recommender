I suffer from patchy/red complexion on my cheeks and breakouts are mainly on my chin and around the mouth.While searching for a sunblock, I wanted something that wouldn't be greasy. Unfortunately, this is very greasy on me. Like, butter on a pan kind of greasy. It does moisturize, and it does apply easily and I can layer it without any effects.I would suggest putting on a tinted BB cream, or just a bit of foundation and lightly powder. That's what I do and my natural oils will appear anyway after several hours, but the shine is not nearly as bad as it is when first applying. It did not cause me any breakouts. It WILL burn your eyes as other reviews mentioned. I figured \"well I'll just avoid my eye area when applying it\" but it has vapors or something that still sting the eyes. Also during the day if you have to itch your eyes, it will burn.",

I have dark acne prone skin that turns oily as soon as you put anything on it. This is the best SPF I've come across so far. And it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy although there is a bit of a sheen on the skin, I wouldn't class it as oily. I haven't had any major breakouts since using it however the one thing I don't like is that at the end of the day it really makes my eyes stink like crazy! So I make sure I wash it off as soon as I come home from work...Although it's expensive and sometimes painful I'd still buy it again as long as I don't end up looking like Casper the ghost!",
