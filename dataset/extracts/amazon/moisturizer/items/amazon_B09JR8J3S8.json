                "reviewText": "I've been using this moisturizer for about half a year now. I like it because it doesn't have a strong scent and feels light on the skin yet moisturizing. It's not irritating to the skin and doesn't make my face oily. It may be a little bit too light on the winter so I apply a little bit more during winter season and it works just fine. A minor complaint is the printing on the moisturizer. I like to clean my skincare products with an alcohol wipe bi-weekly to keep them clean in humid areas like bathroom and this is the only product that bleeds ink when I clean it. Maybe try a different printing method or ink? Other than that, the product itself is great so if you have sensitive/oily skin, I suggest you give it a try.",

                "reviewText": "I would absolutely give this moisturizer a 10/10 it is the first moisturizer that I have found that doesn\u2019t make me break out, doesn\u2019t make my skin oily after one hour of putting it on and doesn\u2019t irritate my skin. My skin is extremely sensitive to skincare products even the ones that specify in being for sensitive skin so for this moisturizer not to irritate it not one bit is very impressive. The only downside is the price to get a bigger size but besides that DEFINITELY would recommend.",
