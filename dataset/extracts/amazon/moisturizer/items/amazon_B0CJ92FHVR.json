In fact I feel like it's helping clear up my blackhead! Somehow.. some way. It's perfect.",

Curology's Cream Moisturizer has a consistency somewhere in the middle. It is creamy but doesn't leave any residue or film on my skin. After I've applied it, I can move on to applying my makeup without having to wait for it to absorb. Alternately, it works well as a final layer at bedtime over one of two serums I'm currently using. It has not caused any irritation or clogged pores. It doesn't really have a scent which I appreciate, since it doesn't conflict with any other skin care products I'm using.",

                "reviewText": "This facial moisturizer is thick with a milky, non-sticky, and non-oily texture. It absorbed nicely into my skin leaving it feeling very hydrated. I have mixed feelings about the bottle design as it dispenses the same amount for each pump so if I just need a little more for my neck it isn\u2019t possible. I am not sure how the design works when the product gets low; is there moisturizer that is wasted and left in the bottom of the bottle? On the positive side, it keeps the moisturizer clean as you don\u2019t have to dip your fingers into a jar. According to an ingredient checker, the ingredient list is clean without concerning additives. Along those lines, I appreciate the brand\u2019s commitment to being cruelty-free, as well as sulfate free, fragrance-free, and paraben-free. This is a very nice moisturizer, especially during the winter months, and I would recommend.",

They built a reputation treating skin problem, so I was excited to try this moisturizer. It left my skin soft and protected. It\u2019s not too heavy for a night lotion, so I can use every night. I\u2019d use it again",
