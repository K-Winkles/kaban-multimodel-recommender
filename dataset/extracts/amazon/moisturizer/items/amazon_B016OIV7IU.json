It absorbs quickly, and there is no unpleasant residue feeling--just lovely, soft skin. I use this every day I leave my house, rain or shine, sun or clouds (Overcast/rainy days are NOT a protection from UVA--aka--UltraViolet AGING--rays). I have combination skin, and am prone to acne--not a blemish from this product. Not one. Give this a try. You don't have to pay a fortune to have sun protection and soft skin. BTW--don't forget your hands. Best way to gauge a woman's age is to look at her hands--plus the skin cancer thing, you know.",

                "reviewText": "I haven't had this for long, so I can't say tooooo much yet, but so far I have three take-aways. 1) I was really hoping this would be ultra-moisturizing because my normally combo/oily face has been flaky lately, and guess what...it's just as flaky with this. 2) I know that sunscreen is supposed to suuuuper helpful for preventing sun damage and ultimately the look of aging. However...from what I can tell, nothing in this actually helps the look of aging if you're sitting inside and not going out in the sun (hello WFH pandemic-life). 3) The scent is off-putting. It smells artificial and chemical-y, and although it dissipates when the lotion dries, if you work up a sweat exercising, the scent is back and just as cloying as ever.I usually like Aveeno facial moisturizers (the positively radiant was my go-to for years, but I'm getting older and want to be more proactive about lines and moisture and whatnot), but this one isn't wowing me.Also - the pump is very generous (i guess you can put some of the excess on the back of your hands or d\u00e9colletage if you'd like), and there is a bit of white-cast at first, but it seems to fade when you rub it in.",
