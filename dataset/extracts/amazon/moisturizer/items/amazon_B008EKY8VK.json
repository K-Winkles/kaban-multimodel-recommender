It has hyaluronic acid (hydration), vitamin c (evens tone) and retinol (reduces wrinkles/firms) - All the ingredients I have been looking for. I use am/pm and I started feeling/seeing a difference in a few weeks. My skin is sofer, firmer and it evened out most of skin tone. I don't think mine has a scent. I do think this is sensitive enough for most skin types too - my skin is never dry and I have not had a breakout. There are other products out there with the same ingredients and much more expensive - this does the same thing for an affordable price. You dont need alot of it each time you use it, so it lasts a while.",

I never use a face cream because I was always nervous it would clog my pores(I am 42) I have been using vitamin c serum for the past 3 years and loved it but always felt like my skin needed more. I have been using this for about 3 weeks and I am obsessed. It keeps my skin moisturized ( a little goes a long way) it does not cause breakouts (at least for me) It does leave a little shine to my skin which I didnt always love when I was younger but now I love it. I have gotten compliments on my skin due to this. My crows feet have diminished and my skin is so smooth and soft.",
