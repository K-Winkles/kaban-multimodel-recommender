                "reviewText": "I work outside everyday in the sun, wind & cold all year long and spend a lot of time in our pool in the summer. The chlorine & elements from weather at work dry my face out so I use this vitamin C product for skin to keep my face looking healthy & repair damage from sun. I've used this face cream for years but it seems much thicker than usual and more greasy than the original formula I'm used to but still nice if you have dryer skin or get a lot of sun. Not recommended for super oily skin. There is an oil free formula but can't seem to find that one easily anymore. Product came brand new & unopened & was not tampered with. I use this on my face everyday but recommend using it mostly at night not before going anywhere because it does turn the skin a bit red at first & makes your face feel hot for little while but that's just the ingredients doing their work! The redness goes away after about an hour. It's not so bad that you can't go in public. The redness is not super drastic. It appears like a sunburn or makes me look like I'm having a hot flash for awhile then it goes away. Once the hot feeling goes away my skin appears younger, smoother, softer & healthier. I don't use anything else on my face other than the sunscreen version & I don't wear foundation or any makeup on my face except for mascara & eyeliner. I'm 45yrs old & get complimented on my skin &nice complexion all the time. I don't have many wrinkles for my age or for someone who works in the sun. I give partial credit to this product & partially to being fortunate to inherit nice skin from my mother & grandmother. I definitely notice a difference in my skin from this face cream though, my face looks younger than the skin anywhere else on my body I wish I could afford to use this as a full body lotion! This formula does leave more shine on my face than the oil free formula so I'm definitely switching back soon as I can. I'll just use this thicker formula on my neck & chest. It has a great orange citrus scent. I swear by this stuff for my face, but I do not have oily or sensitive skin so I can't say for other skin types. It is getting more expensive & comes in a smaller size than before but what isn't these days.",

                "reviewText": "BUYER BEWARE! Containers Less Than Half Full!I've been buying this fantastic moisturizer in person from stores for well over a decade. It's non-toxic, a little goes a long way without being heavy or greasy, I never need to reapply unless I wash my face so it's very effective and awesome in every way. It used to be a cream but they've changed it into a \"gel cream\"... at first I was resistant to switching. But the former version is no longer made, so I tried the gel cream, expecting to be unsatisfied... I was pleasantly surprised to find that it works just as well. And it should smell like oranges and nothing musty or moldy or rancid. Any jars that have a funky smell are literally long expired and rancid product - so people SHOULD NEVER PUT ANY PRODUCT IN THAT TOXIC STATE ON THEIR SKIN. PERIOD. Trust your nose!HOWEVER, due to my longterm experience with this product, I know these containers are supposed to not only smell like fresh oranges (and no other smells) but they are also supposed to be filled to the very top of the rim, and the container should have a tamper safe seal (usually a shrunken plastic wrap around the jar). If there isn't one, it's definitely been tampered with. When I opened this jar, it was unsealed and it was less than half full. (RED FLAGS!) Seeing all the other reviews, it's clear that something nefarious is going on. I have my suspicions as to why these aren't sealed or full to the rim, but those statements were not allowed so I had to modify my review. Therefore, you'll have to use your imagination about what the problem is if other orders of this moisturizer arrive half empty and/or smelling funky. Funky smells indicate a product has expired and is now toxic, even if it 'looks' fine.Receiving less than half of what I paid for is infuriating... potentially gross, too. Needless to say, I sent it back for a refund.I can only hope that it will be sold in stores again so I can continue using it, as I don't trust what I'll get from online anymore. Otherwise I'll have to deal with the misery of trial and error in the quest to find something that 1. doesn't mess with my skin (95% of skincare products do) and 2. that does as good of a job as this has for about 15 years. I'm wishing us all luck!",
