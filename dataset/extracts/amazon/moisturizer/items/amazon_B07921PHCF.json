                "reviewText": "It's a 3.3oz.small bottle of lotion, that does what it says. The. The effects are noticeable it helps with the appearance of dark circles and puffiness. That said, nothing feels like that cool little metal roller ball with the slippery goo inside under your eyes in the morning. Waking up after brushing my teeth & shaving, if it's that kind if day & rolling some of that goo under my eyes is a fresh way to start the day that's all I'm sayin' They both do a great job of moisturizing, i just wish the roll-on had more product inside. That's why i got this, my roll-on ran out & i decided to try it. I figured it was just a larger amount of the same slippery goo that's inside the roll-on ( they share similar ingredients) but this is more like a standard lotion, maybe a little thinner. Even when you're behaving\" exercising, hydrating & getting enough sleep this is a great daily moisturizer. I also use a jar of Vitamin E which you'd think would render these products superfluous but the Bulldog products have something extra. And a start your day feeling not even my favorite aftershave can match. I think it's the cool metal ball but that slippery goo is nice too. Maybe I'll use both. But I do like this lotion.",

                "reviewText": "ABSOLUTELY LOVE this product ! I love the whole line of Bulldog skincare products ! I find the scents as addicting as the feel of the product ! The anti aging moisturizer has a different scent than the original moisturizer line... To me, it has a subtle yet satisfying scent of marijuana ! : ) I don\u2019t smoke pot, but have always found the smell of it appealing. Not only do i love the scent of this product, but it truly is effective in rejuvenating the skin. You notice the difference immediately upon application\u2014a soft, supple, non-greasy, dewy, youthful complexion. I should note that i am a female, and this line remains a favorite part of my daily and nightly skincare routine. I bring it every where with me, and apply it around the clock (it\u2019s literally therapeutic for me). It also beats out other product lines in how clean and refreshing it feels\u2014it applies clean and continues to feel refreshing and silky no matter how many times you reapply (no peeling, no stickiness, no flaking\u2014no matter how many layers you apply). I even put this product on my young children who have sensitive skin. Can not say enough good things about this product line.",
