                "reviewText": "Okay this stuff is awesome. I dont have wrinkles, but I am doing preventative stuff... as a girl now-a-days in her MID 20's this is a good thing to do. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, any age, gender, skin color, skin type, etc....Perricone md makes my skin feel like silk and has decreased redness.. also firmed a little around the cheeks/jaw and eyes, and most noticeable for me(over past 4 weeks) diminished acne scaring and acne breakouts. My face doesn't have dry patches with an oily T zone anymore. It's just normal, healthy soft skin... and its basically WINTER in Pennsylvania right now! I would normally be as dry as a burnt piece of toast. I have only a few TINY fine lines nothing that would make me look a day over 25 haha. Anyways, the smell is possibly a turn off to some.... I dont like the smell of rose scented creams, it reminds me of working at the nursing home. BUT I like this cream a lot. I'm fair skinned, with some old acne scaring, hyper-pigmentation, oily/dry skin, occasional acne..from my Mirena IUD (made me get acne all over my body. And ive never had acne except during puberty. But as my skin md advised it is actually going away slowly after about 6 months of freaking out...) The smell is not a problem for me anyhow... I dont even notice it after like 30 minutes... my boyfriend likes the smell haha. I dont hate it. Another thing i like it how when you put it on after a nice session of microderm scrubbin' it makes your face feel super fresh and tingly, like you dipped your face in ice water with eucalyptus or mint leaf... idk... it feels good and I know its making my pores WAY SMALLER when i feel that :-). which was the real selling factor for me. I say buy it... try it, worth a shot. If you cant afford it on here... buy it off HSN and do the easy value pays... or whichever tv channel its on. I love VALUE PAY haha",
