This Labiotte cream is everything I want in a water cream and I really like it. It has an ultra lightweight, silky gel texture and my skin absorbs it instantaneously. I live in the desert and sometimes my skin needs even more moisture. On those days, I use this cream for the hydrating, plumping effects and I wear a heavier moisturizer on top to seal it all in. I also appreciate that this product isn\u2019t heavily scented because I use products from different lines and I am not a fan of heavy scents that compete with each other.The bottom line is this: when I run out of Labiotte water cream, I will place another order.",

                "reviewText": "Another K beauty keeper for me. This water cream had me at lactic acid, which always delivers gentle exfoliation and a lovely glow. The ingredient \"hyalbiome\" appears to be trademarked by Labiotte. I assume it is a hyaluronic acid derivative and the moisture delivering agent of this formula. Kudos to them for including a cute little lucite scoop so you don't contaminate your product. The consistency is gel like and spreads and absorbs readily. My dry skin feels very hydrated. It has the faintest of fresh scents. The packaging is downright luxurious if you keep your products on a vanity.Nice way to start my day with this water cream!",

I'm applying it twice a day, early in the morning and afternoon. It smells nice and subtle, which I appreciate enormously! Unfortunately, the full list of ingredients is not disclosed, neither if these is cruelty free. This comes from Korea, and most of the printing in the box is in tier language. I wish they'd be more transparent. taking a star for this reason.",
