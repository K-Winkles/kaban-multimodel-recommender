                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Dry, sensitive, acne prone skin you need this!",
                "reviewText": "First off I read the reviews which convinced me to try this product. Secondly, I almost never pay this amount for a moisturizer. Not because the good stuff isn't worth it but mostly because I don't have extra money to spend on something that MAY work on my dry, sensitive, acne prone skin. I previously used raw shea butter as it was the only thing that got rid of my dry patches, actually penetrated my skin and didn't make my acne worse. It didn't make my condition better though. 2 weeks in (and I will update later) and I have to say overall my acne as decreased to the point my face is almost clear. I usually don't have acne all over but usually along my jaw line and more on the cheeks during TOTM. My complexion has certainly even out getting rid of the ruddiness and patchy dried out look. I am impressed with the ingredients as I know for my skin honey and aloe work wonders, shea butter has always been kind but combined together has been great. I can't use aloe alone its no where near moisturizing enough but it heals amazingly and I can't wear honey everywhere either. I was concerned about coconut oil cause I know it can be comedogenic and alone it always sat on my skin never sinking in. There have been no breakouts from this at all if that is a concern. Ok sorry for the tangent but I wanted to be thorough. First impression it had a slight burning sensation the first time I used it. I chalked it up to my skin is sensitive and was slightly inflamed at the time. Second application there was no burning. This stuff sank in very quickly to the point it felt like my skin was naturally soft and I didn't have moisturizer on. I ended up using a little more around my nose and other dry patches I had. It is still winter after all. They went away after that. After 2 weeks my skin is more balanced that I don't need more after my initial application. I'm not used to this quite yet as I got used to having a greasy feeling until everything sank in because my skin was so parched. This just feels like healthy moist skin. I don't need cover up now and refuse to put on foundation because I want my skin to breathe and it's been wonderful. I think this is definitely a purchase worth fitting into your budget. I have tried so many natural, organic very costly face moisturizers over the years and have spent so much time trying to create my own homemade stuff but I couldn't make something as wonderful as this. If this stuff continues to work and I don't have any reactions later on which I usually would have by now then my search for a perfect moisturizer is over. I would like to add I use this in conjunction with African Black Soap purchased on Amazon from seller smellgood and its a very thick paste not bar form. I need help with acne scarring and it has definitely helped clear up remaining acne and prevented breakouts. I also add a drop of Cosmedica Hyaluronic Acid (sold on Amazon also with great reviews) to the moisturizer for extra moisture and help with fine lines as I'm 30 and already have them. If you found this review helpful, albeit long winded please hit the button so as many people as possible can read it and make an informed decision. I can't say its a miracle cream like some but I can say it is pretty darn close and I wouldn't write a fake review if you paid me to. Have a great day!",

                "reviewText": "Love this and just purchased again as I am nearly out. I use it as a face cream (generously) twice a day and the 2 oz cream lasted just over a month.This cream is very thick and moisturizing, but it absorbs quickly and just leaves the skin soft, not greasy! I have struggled to find a cream that balances my skin. Either they are too moisturizing and I have oily skin and breakouts, or they leave my skin dry. This stuff is magic.I have used other organic brands (Derma e is my other favorite right now) that I love pretty equally, but this is a bit cheaper and such a great product.It is unscented but the cocoa butter gives it the slightest fragrance of cocoa, I love it but if you have an aversion to that smell it could be a problem.This product is one of a couple healthy choices I have made for my skin in the last month, and my breakouts are nearly gone and I have barely had to wear any makeup at all as a result. While this stuff only gets partial credit and there are other great products out there as well, I'm sticking with this as I just love how my skin looks and feels when using it.This stuff isn't going to give you the flawless complexion of a 6 year old (unless you happen to be 6 years old), but any product that promises to erase the years is only selling you a fantasy anyway. What this can give you is healthy, beautiful skin, fine lines and all, and that's all I'm looking for in a cream.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased this item twice now and used the entire product.I have a long history of acne, oily skin, and dry skin. Finding a product that does not trigger acne can be quite the daunting task. I gave this product a try due to the many claims made. I was a bit skeptical because many products do not do exactly what they claim. Additionally, I often worry how new products will react with my other medications. At this point I am using tretinoin and clindamycin. The product has not had any sort of negative interaction with these medications in my experience (granted you would need to check with your dermatologist first!)This product has a very smooth feel and sometimes feels cool on the face. It is a little on the thicker side but dries fairly quick. It does not like a shine or make my skin oilier than typical. When my skin is dry )thanks to my prescription topicals,) it has a great soothing affect and brings the skin back to where it needs to be. It has not promoted acne in any way nor blackheads. There is a small smell to the product but it disappears quite fast.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is due to the price. If I had the choice, I would use this product all the time for a long time to come. However, it is a bit pricier and the container is a little small (4oz). The container does allow you to get every bit of the product out because the cap screws off compared to squeeze or pump bottles. A little does go a long way thankfully but buying this often would add up quick. If I was using it on any part of my body other than my face, this container would get used up even quicker.",

                "reviewText": "Meine Mutter hat seit jahren unter seltsamen, stark juckenden Schuppenflechten auf Ihrer Kopfhaut gelitten und weder haben die diversen Salben, welches Sie von Ihrem Hautarzt verschrieben bekommen hat gewirkt, noch haben unz\u00e4hlige andere Produkte wie Teebaum\u00f6l, Oliven\u00f6l usw. etwas gebracht.Eigentlich hatte Sie sich schon damit abgefunden mit der Hauterkrankung leben zu m\u00fcssen, doch da bin ich durch das Internet auf diese Salbe aufmerksam geworden und habe es direkt bestellt.Ehrlich gesagt war ich nicht sehr optimistisch, dass diese Salbe dort erfolg haben wird wo so viele andere Produkte versagt haben, jedoch wurde ich eines besseren belehrt. Sie benutzt diese Salbe nun seit etwa 1,5 Monaten 2-3 mal am Tag und die Hauterkrankung ist fast komplett verschwunden.Das starke jucken verschwand schon innerhalb der ersten 2 Wochen der Therapie und seitdem werden die Schuppenflechte(oder was immer das auch war) immer weniger und die Wunden auf Ihrer Kopfhaut k\u00f6nnen endlich verheilen, da die Salbe von e-raorganics sowohl das Jucken bek\u00e4mpft, als auch die Wundheilung enorm unterst\u00fctzt und beschleunigt. Ich w\u00fcnschte ich h\u00e4tte vorher nachher Bilder gemacht, aber leider habe ich wirklich nicht damit gerechnet, dass es so gut wirkt.Ich pers\u00f6hlich benutze die Salbe auch f\u00fcrs Gesicht gegen Falten oder bei Schnittverletzungen welches ich mir \u00f6fters beim Sport oder beim Rasieren zuziehe und bin einfach nur begeistert von dem Produkt.Wir haben auch die e-raorganics relief ausprobiert, jedoch hat es uns nicht so sehr \u00fcberzeugen k\u00f6nnen, da es(f\u00fcr uns) von der Wirksamkeit und der Effektivit\u00e4t nicht mit der e-raorganics complete mithalten kann.",

The difference I've found with this is that it doesn't leave much residue on the surface of your skin. It really does feel like your skin has absorbed it and still leaves it feeling moisturised hours after use. Other products leave my skin feeling oily and don't help my breakouts or aren't long lasting so need to reapply more often as my skin starts to dry and feel irritated again.Very much been impressed with this product after just a few days use. Will post an updated review after I have worked with it a bit longer.So far both thumbs up.",
