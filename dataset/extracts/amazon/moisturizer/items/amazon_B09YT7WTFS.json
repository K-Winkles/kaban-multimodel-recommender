I researched products for itchy skin and this lotion had good reviews so I gave it a try.It is incredible. It blends into your skin extremely well. It\u2019s not oily or greasy and feels fantastic on your skin. It feels penetrative. There is no scent which I\u2019m not used to. It\u2019s understandable that Naturium would omit fragrance as some scents can be irritating to the skin.I also purchased the shower cleanser which I haven\u2019t tried yet. I will review as soon as I use it.Highly recommend!",
