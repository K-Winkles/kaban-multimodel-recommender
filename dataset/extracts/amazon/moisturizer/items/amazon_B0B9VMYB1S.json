RoC has amazing products that are great for over 50 women/men. They (I think) were the 1st to come out with OTC retinol at affordable prices for our budget-conscious people. I looked at many neck/face creams prior to purchasing this, happy I did! It provides wonderful hydration for my dry thirsty skin. When I wake up in the morning my skin feels soft and hydrated, I love that it no longer feels tight. Great products especially if you are a mature (okay very mature) person such as myself with severely dry and thirsty skin, I will be buying their day cream next and looking forward to it, as it stands now I use their retinol eye cream and this neck/face cream and they both are marvelous products, I have used their retinol serum in the past and it's just as good as the more pricey OTC retinol serums without feeling dry and tight, if anything their retinol products have majorly hydrated my skin, thanks RoC for keeping it real! I would say you rock, but you know that!",

It's thin enough I can apply it easily and evenly to my entire neck and under my chin. It's not greasy or sticky.

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been a ROC fan for many years, but only ever used the daily moisturizer. However, I know also use this and it keeps all that it promises! I have seen a marked difference in the skin on my neck and face. I am 70 years old and didn\u2019t expect that to the degree it actually happened. I can only recommend this cream, it leaves your skin so soft, doesn\u2019t smell and the price is awesome!",
