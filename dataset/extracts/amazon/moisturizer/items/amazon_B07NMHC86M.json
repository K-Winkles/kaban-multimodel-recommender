No - that's what makes a gel moisturizer ideal for wearing under makeup. It dries down quickly without a residue, but with an ever-so-slightly tacky texture that gives makeup something to grab onto and allows it to last longer. How do I know if this product is authentic?

                "reviewText": "There doesn't seem to be any standardized definition of what a product will be like if it is sold as a \"gel cream\". I ordered three different gel cream products at the same time to try, including this one, and all three were vastly different from one another.Of the three I ordered, I like this one the most. It is most like a soft gel for sure, although not like a cream at all. It absorbs easily and doesn't stay sticky.I have eczema-prone skin, and the centella has become an ingredient that I really like. It is so soothing for me, as well as not creating further problems. After too much sun one time, it felt so good and really seemed to help! It even soothes the occasional inflamed acne spot.The texture and moisturization are perfect for summer months for me, when I don't have much issue with dry skin.I also like the way it is fragrance free, as far as I can tell.This is going to be on my regular rotation for summer skincare.",

                "reviewText": "First off - thanks Hyram for the recommendation of this product. In less than a month, this has almost completely cleared my skin and helped prevent new acne.I have been trying everything for years to get rid of my constantly reoccurring adult acne along the cheeks and jawline. Nothing had worked even remotely close to this moisturizer. Acne is almost zapped away overnight, red spots have cleared, and the amounts of breakouts I have has decreased at least 90%.To start my routine, I use a oil cleanser (when I wear makeup) and follow up with a mild salicylic acid cleanser. I then use the Tea Tree serum from iUnik and then this moisturizer. Now, since it is winter where I live (freezing and dry) and since I have normal skin type that goes dryer in the winter and oilier in the summer, this moisturizer doesn't provide enough moisture for me, so I go in with a supplemental HA moisturizer as well.If you have oily skin, I think you will love this product and will not need to supplement with an additional moisturizer. It is a really lightweight formula that instantly gets absorbed by the skin. If you are on the dryer side, I would still recommend this product, but use it like a serum and then go in add an additional moisturizer.Do beware, with the recent reformulation some added fragrance is now on the list of ingredients. However, they are the last ingredients and I believe they are just there to lightly counteract the smell from the ingredient substitute that allowed them to eliminate silicone from the formulation. Frankly, you can't even smell it. Even with overly sensitive skin, I wouldn't worry that the fragrance will have too much of a negative impact. The other ingredients are so fantastic that they greatly outweigh the small amount of fragrance added.Overall, I'm so impressed by this product that I would recommend it over any other products available in the popular beauty stores like Sephora and Ulta.",

                "reviewText": "Skincare is extremely important and frugal to me, and as a newbie I\u2019ve been doing A TON of research, so this is going to be a loaded review that details just about everything I\u2019ve learned about this product and how it works with other products. Hopefully it helps others who struggle with oily skin and acne breakouts.I\u2019m 21 years old and live in a dry, desert climate, so I have oily yet dry skin, meaning that due to the dry nature of my skin, i produce excess sebum which causes oiliness and (newly) breakouts. I can\u2019t express how important this information is when looking for skincare products!!! Don\u2019t look at just the benefits of certain products, make sure you know your skin type and it\u2019s sensitivities before purchasing!!I follow a 3-5 step skincare routine, using 3 main products daily, and occasionally using a toner or an exfoliant. I haven\u2019t tried any serums or essences yet due to my skins acne prone nature and needing to learn how my skin reacts to products first\u2014 essentially, if you\u2019re new to skincare, don\u2019t dive right into a 5-10 step routine, make a foundation that addresses your primary concerns first and learn how your skin reacts to certain products.I\u2019ve swapped through many products all read, from Klair\u2019s Gentle Black Deep Cleansing Oil to Acewell\u2019s Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner, to Missha\u2019s Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cream to Thank You Farmer\u2019s SPF, and more, all of which did not help, despite being good products for others.The routine I currently run with is:Hanskin\u2019s Pore Cleansing Oil BHAEtude\u2019s Soon Jung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser (which i may be swapping soon)and now Iunik\u2019s Centella Calming Gel Cream+ the occasional Green Tea exfoliant and Apple Cider Vinegar homemade toner (important to do research before using ACV!!)This cream has been the absolute cherry on top. My double cleanse plus a moisturizer was doing okay, it was an improvement but i was still getting breakouts and having an oily sheen afterwards. Iunik\u2019s Calming Gel has tied it all together into a neat little bow. It\u2019s only been 3 days and my acne is already clearing up 10-fold. All of my pimples have broken down into tiny spots and are going away quickring than ever, I haven\u2019t had any new breakouts yet and my skin doesn\u2019t feel slick and greasy.The only thing I have to say is do not apply this in your bathroom after showering, the moisture in the air will cause it to absorb poorly and you will be left with your skin feeling tight and dry. Wait until the humidity in the bathroom has aired out and it isn\u2019t so hot before applying this product. When applied correctly, it works great!I was going to give this 4 stars, as I still feel that there may be a bit more moisture to be desired, but it does as advertised and truly works. so I\u2019m going to be testing out some serums and essences to find one that\u2019s compatible with my new routine to get that extra moisture boost. If this product continues working the way it has these last 3 days, it will easily become a staple in my routine.But summary of all this, if you have skin like mine that isn\u2019t very sensitive, but struggles with excess sebum and acne, this product will most likely work for you!",

                "reviewText": "I like the gel texture. It dries down pretty quickly but doesn't leave me flaking or peeling or anything. It worked well for the first week or so, but I realized that it's making my skin itch for a considerable amount of time after each use. Perhaps I have an allergic reaction to the centella in it. It makes me sad that I will probably not continue using the product. I would say to try the product. It should do the job as long as you're not allergic. It didn't cause me any acne or anything, and I have sensitive oily skin.",

It feels very light after application and doesn't leave any sticky residue at all. I've noticed significantly fewer breakouts too, which has been a complete blessing. I use this product everyday and it's lasted me for just over 6 months, so it's excellent value for money too!",
