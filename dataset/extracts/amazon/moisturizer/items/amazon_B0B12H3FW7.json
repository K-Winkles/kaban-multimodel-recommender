                "reviewText": "Trying to find plastic free (or as close as I can get) options for moisturizer is surprisingly difficult when you have acne prone and sensitive skin like me. It\u2019s even more difficult when you\u2019re also cautious of chemicals.So when I saw this EWG verified product that tried to minimize the amount of plastic they use and make sure the plastic used is recycled? I had to jump on it! I had tried a solid moisturizer bar meant for acne prone skin and I had break outs \ud83d\ude2c So I\u2019ll use it sparingly now and then I bought this is the replacement to my sample of Pacifica moisturizer that has now run out.I have crazy sensitive skin, but no allergies that I can think of so make sure to read the ingredients just in case. In the past I also had cystic acne that even today threatens to return. I exfoliate a little harder than I should every other day or two and it leaves my skin pretty dry (it always is after a shower).This stuff has been perfect so far though! No reactions, soaks in quick, feels nice and light, no fragrance that I can smell, and leaves my face feeling plump and happy!Of course my skin is different than others, but the price is reasonable for facial moisturizer in my opinion. If you have acne prone skin that is sensitive (but maybe not crazy crazy sensitive) give it a try and do a patch test. :) At worst you\u2019re out only $15!",

However, on a whim and based on ingredients, I tried this product, and I am over two weeks with twice-a-day use, and my skin looks good. It does not make my face greasy feeling and has not caused any breakouts or irritation. I LOVE THIS! I love it so much I am buying it for my 3 sisters!The moisturizer was, as expected, related to thickness and texture and has little to no smell. It feels clean going on and makes my skin look and feel refreshed. Overall, I have never had such good outcomes with a product before, and I have tried a lot of products over my time as a consumer. You only need a pea-sized amount to cover your face and neck, so the value for your money is VERY on point!Y'all, I am impressed and excited to finally have a moisturizer I am happy with and that my skin is happy with also!",

                "reviewText": "This moisturizer is very dense that\u2019s why a little goes a long way. Using more than that feels heavy on the skin. That\u2019s probably why the package is not too big. The last one I bought lasted exactly three months, and I used it every night. What I like most is the packaging that is easy to recycle and kind to the environment. I wish more cosmetic products were produced responsibly like this.",
