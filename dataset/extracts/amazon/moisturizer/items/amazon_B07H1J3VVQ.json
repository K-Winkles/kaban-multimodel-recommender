Around age 55, the oil production of our skin diminishes by 40%, which contributes to the dryness and discomfort most women experience around this age. In addition, circulation and cell turn over slow down, leading to dullness and lack of rosy color. What happens to skin at night and should I be using products at night to help support it? At night, skin repairs itself. Night creams that provide nourishing and exfoliating actives can help to repair barrier function while removing dull, dead skin cells to promotes faster cell turnover and renewed rosy radiance. Does skin age faster during and after menopause? No. Our skin has a \u201croadmap\u201d for its ageing since we are born. That roadmap is affected by external factors, like sun, smoke, pollution and internal factors such as nutrition, sleep, stress.",

                "reviewText": "I have never used anything by L\u2019Oreal, but I recently ran out of my Glossier FutureDew, and after reordering I realized there would be a few days I\u2019d be without my \u201cdewy glow\u201d for more days than I want to be. Even though I barely wear makeup during this COViD isolation, I try to keep my skin looking fresh and healthy for my husband and kids. Anyways, I looked for something to hold me over till my FutureDew comes in, and, for the price, I figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try this stuff. I bought the \u201cfragrance-free\u201d because I generally don\u2019t like scent on my face. I hadn\u2019t read the ingredients before I tried it, but upon application I immediately recognized the scent of Methyldihydrojasmonate, which I am familiar with from using Nia24 Skin Strengthening Complex. It\u2019s not a bad scent, but it\u2019s quite strong, and I can\u2019t have it near my eyes.As far as the product performance goes; it\u2019s basically a very lightly tinted moisturizer that adds a touch of warm pink coloring to skin. I love the texture! It\u2019s thick, but it\u2019s not greasy or heavy. It coats the skin evenly and smoothly, and it stays put. I am really glad I purchased this, because it looks and feels great on my face and neck. It gives my whole look a \u201cpick me up\u201d.",

I also hate wearing foundation so the Rosy Tone Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer gives me a beautiful, youthful, healthy rosy glow. Not too pink just healthy. And the smell as devine. I love it so much I much I even scrape the bottle clean with a Q-tip to make sure I've used it all. ;)",

                "reviewText": "This is nice lotion, it has some stuff in it that isn't the best for skin and that's a big reason why I gave it 4 stars. It's really expensive for something with fillers and other stuff in it.Having said that, it's nice enough. I bought it a lot for the peony, I love Korean cosmetics and I was excited to find that this had a lot of things in it that Japanese and Korean high end cosmetics use. It also has some cutting edge peptides in it and some other good things too.I almost gave it 3 stars because of the color. I was among the many who thought the color would be cool, it wasn't. I mostly use it around my eyes and it's not helpful there at all. I use a massage tool that heats up and thankfully it helps me to use less of the lotion and therefore less of the color. The color does nothing XD it doesn't add a healthy glow to cheeks, it's really incredibly somehow useless, I'm not sure why at all. It's not a very good pink, maybe it's because it's kind of an orangey color.I think if you have the sort of coloring that goes well with orange, you'll be one of the people who writes a 5 star review for this product. I have skin that likes pink and tends to go well with pink. The fillers and other sub-par chemicals in this mean that there are other products out there that can do better for less. This isn't a bad product, but it's not the best and it isn't worth it for this price tag.",
