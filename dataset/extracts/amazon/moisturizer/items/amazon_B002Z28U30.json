Carolyn's Facial Fitness is different because sometimes you massage while you do the exercises. The upper lip exercise is working on my lip lines. I am adding this to my top 4 favorites. Face exercises work if you do them. You can also over-train. When I over train I look older. I like Carolyn's advice to take two or three days off. One reviewer thought Carolyn looked her age...I think she looks beautiful, she is in her late 60's or early 70's, but I have seen people in their 40's that look older than Carolyn.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had forehead lines and worry lines between my eye brows for several years. I spent a lot of money going to an aesthetician to try to eliminate them & to my disappointment, saw no improvement. I then discovered Carolyn\u2019s Facial Fitness Facial Exercise Program online about five years ago, and ordered it. I spent about one week going through the training DVD to learn the exercises. I progressed from sitting upright to learn the exercises, to then laying on the floor to increase muscle resistance and the use of my facial muscles; as Carolyn instructs.It is important to work the CFF exercises into your daily routine, as with any exercise program. And just like any exercise program, the CFF exercises do not bring instant results. It takes about 15 minutes 3-5 days per week (depending on your age) to perform the basic sequence of exercises once you learn them. After the initial few weeks, I saw my lines widening, which actually meant they were getting shallower. I diligently performed the exercises for about two years. I saw my face having a younger appearance. My cheeks were much firmer. My crowsfeet were nearly gone. My forehead wrinkles were nearly gone. Family I hadn\u2019t seen in years saw a photo of me and emailed me saying how great I looked.Then, life happened, and I stopped doing the exercises. I have been sporadic on doing the exercises this past two years. Every time I go back to the exercises, I see improvement within a few days. I am now working on getting in a routine of performing the exercises, as recommended for my age, 4-5 days a week. The routine is key. The CFF facial exercises are much cheaper than doing Botox and do not have the side effects. With the CFF program, you work on all the facial muscles, not just a few isolated ones. I highly recommend Carolyn\u2019s Facial Fitness Facial Exercises.",

                "reviewText": "The creator of this superb program is an Academic who has studied/perfected Facial Exercise AND skin care with continuous research and experimentation over a period of two decades. She condensed her years of research into a 15minute basic program which combines isometrics (resistance training) with select massage moves to achieve glorious results IF one is consistent. It takes a few days to learn the routine, and should be performed two to five times per week, depending on one's age. Hers is the ONLY program designed to sculpt underlying facial muscles AND firm the outer skin layer. Plus, Carolyn's customer service is outstanding....she is easy to reach by email or phone, and is happy to assist her clients in personalized 'tweaking' of the routine to address any stubborn areas ---as a personal trainer does. Her knowledge is vast, and WILL be of great benefit to anyone who chooses to do the exercises. Making her program a lifestyle is one of the best decisions I have ever made. I cannot recommend her program enough--one need never resign themselves to a droopy visage, or subject themselves to the invasive, costly and temporary 'fix' of botox, fillers, facelifts, etc. The answer to aging with natural and beautiful grace is HERE, with THIS program.",

                "reviewText": "I first tried facercise for men, the book, and it was showing some results but nothing special. I wanted to buy a more professional kit so after tons of research I decided on CFF, and it was a great decision. Carolyn is truly a scientist on face exercises, and this program is so perfect with how there's a DVD to learn the 28 exercises, then a \"pacing cd\" where she counts for u in a perfect little 15 minute program. Everything about it is perfect. People constantly call me \"young\".It also comes with flash cards, a booklet, and tons of other goodies. Truly state-of-the-art. I can't explain how lucky I feel to own this kit while in my 20's, I will be using face exercises for a loooong time... It truly is one of the closest ways of getting to the fountain of youth your gonna get.Another thing this kit is good for is having good complexion. And the lotion sample it comes with is so good, it feels so natural and healthy... It makes store-bought lotions (aveeno, etc) feel like they're full of chemicals.The only downfall I would say is she doesn't discuss how strongly your attitude and emotions affect your face degrading and the quality... It really is inner beauty that makes ur face look good, but the face exercises double it. Depression also makes ur face look bad.I read the book \"facelifting by exercise\", written 30+ years ago, and that is the most scientific material on face exercise, beauty, etc ever made. It tells u how to wash ur face properly, how ur mind and emotions affect ur skin and face, and every possible thing u can think of relating to facial beautyAnyway, if u want to look and feel \"fresher\" and more vitale, buy this kit. It works",
