And this checks that box.It claims to be help \"plump\" your skin, I don't know what that means and I don't know if I've ever seen that effect, but like I said earlier... skin issues.It does have a scent, which I almost didn't use it because I try to stick to fragrance free. But it's not terribly overpowering.I think it works great, I can apply it a couple times a day, if needed, without it making my skin worse.",

I always do thorough research when buying online and moisturizer is no exception since I have severely dry sensitive skin I have to be cautious on what I use. Not only was the delivery quick but so were the results! If you look at the photos the middle picture shows what my face looked like one week ago (the sun does this to me yall!) So I bought some glow recipe toner, another great product, and it cleared up the rash then started using the moisturizer today and as you can see in the first photo my face is cleared up and looks radiant! This is the clearest my face has looked since I don't know when! It feels so good on my skin I can't stop feeling my face \u263a no more redness, itchiness, and no more rash! Go buy this!!!",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a moisturizer that was fragrance, was fairly moisturizing but not too greasy, and had multiple beneficial ingredients. I read a lot of ingredient lists and reviews and settled on this one and I'm so glad I did. The texture is gel-cream and it absorbs completely without being sticky. It doesn't pill my sunscreen or makeup. It is fragrance-free but does not smell bad like some other brands. It contains the same peptides as matrixyl, it has niacinamide, squalane, multiple humectants (glycerine, sodium hyaluronate, etc.), and it feels light on the skin. I'm more prone toward dry skin so I use this day and night. It's a steal for the price.",
