It is good for moisturizing and I feel that it absorbs pretty quickly.I use this product at night, and sometimes after work.If you like gel-type cosmetics, this is really very good,: packaging, instructions, description about correct way to use the product.The current price is excellent-so many gels are very costly. The Curology product is really well-priced.After using the gel for several days, I find that I prefer a creme-based product.My recommendation is high for those people loving gel-based moisturizers AND for those interested in trying out a gel moisturized because the price is right to try it!",
