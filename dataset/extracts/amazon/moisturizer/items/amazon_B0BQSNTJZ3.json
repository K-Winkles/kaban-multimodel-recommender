Obviously since it\u2019s meant to be use with it however I liked other night creams and would try to use them but changing to thin the night I used the Differin treatment was a game changer. This cream does burn a little but I think it\u2019s the treatment more than the lotion. This lotion will keep my skin from drying out and I wake up with very hydrated skin.",

Because I found in the past other moisturizers, always have to end up applying more to get the proper moisturization saw my skin doesn\u2019t feel dry.
