                "reviewText": "I have super sensitive skin to the point that moisturizers, even targeted for sensitive skin, burn my face. I have both rosacea and eczema which makes it difficult to find products. This cream has no scent but it also is more thick gel consistency and dries matte...which is the opposite of what dry skin needs. On its own it made my skin feel hydrated for maybe 10 seconds before it felt like the moisture was sucked out of my skin. But it doesn't burn my skin. Luckily, I have the moisture renewal oil (same brand) to add to this. The oil didn't work with my old moisturizer and I didn't want to toss it because of how expensive it is. On a whim, I found it works perfectly with this moisturizer. It takes exactly three drops mixed in to make my skin actually feel hydrated. With that said, I have also found that I have to use quite a bit to cover my face. Normally I can make a 1 oz tube/jar of lotion last a few months, with this, I am barely making it to the one month mark and this is a 2 oz tube!I have to use between a nickel to quarter size amount (PLUS the oil) to cover my face and I use this twice a day. I also bought the face wash and toner from the same line to help with the moisture. The toner helps a lot so if you buy this, you definitely need a moisturizing toner and face oil to go along with it. This product is awful on its own unless maybe you have oily skin. I don't even think normal skin would be hydrated by this. I gave it three stars because it doesn't break me out or burn my skin which is a miracle. I am going to repurchase only because I have the oil to make it work. But I am definitely going to explore their other moisturizers.Tl;dr Awful product on its own. Too drying and not cost effective for amount needed (2 oz tube barely lasts a month with twice daily application). Plus you need an oil to mix in for actual hydration and potentially a hydrating toner as well. Only plus is that it doesn't burn on application or cause breakouts.",

                "reviewText": "I almost never review products. In fact, this is probably the first non-book product I've ever used and I've ordered an embarrassingly high quantity of products from Amazon. I'm 36 and my whole life I've had a red nose. I've spent my whole adult life trying different concealers for it and I've used pricey ones- Il makiage, tarte's shape tape, make up forever, Nars etc etc and my red nose always ends up showing through my foundation by the end of the day.Today was my second day using this product and it's 9 pm and my nose still doesn't look red. I'm amazed!!",

                "reviewText": "The product initially had good consistency, not too oily on skin/Mattifying yet felt hydrated. Almost like petroleum consistency which is good as a skin barrier. After a couple days (stored in closet, not extreme temp) I noticed the product had coagulated and separated. When coming out of the tube it came out in chunks. Some creamy some chunky. Disgusting. Doesn\u2019t mis well with other products and caused pilling. Like your skin is peeling off except it\u2019s the moisturizer. I used to get drunk elephant and was trying out something new for night hydration. This was not it. Wouldn\u2019t recommend although I love the Paula\u2019s choice brand these new formulas need work.",
