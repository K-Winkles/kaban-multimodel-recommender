                "reviewText": "I never thought I would find a facial moisturizer that would work for me. I have tried many brands and none of them worked as well as Mineral Fusion. I have finally found the one! I am Chinese and have very sensitive skin. It's hard to find the right face moisturizer for Asian skin. My friend introduced me to Mineral Fusion and let me try hers, I loved it the first try and wanted to buy it on Amazon.In the Winter I have dry patches on my face. So far I have used it for a month and I was surprised that my skin complexion looked brighter and felt softer in the first week. Also, I haven't had a single outbreak of pimples, acne, or blackheads since then. It smells like natural aroma from Earth and it's soothing in the evening.I recommend this to anyone that has dry sensitive skin, and any normal skin type. It is very gentle and light, not harsh. It will feel like you're applying lotion on your face, except it's very light and non oily. It leaves your skin feeling moisturized and rejuvenated! And even if the price may be more than you'd like, it is WORTH IT.",

I started using this moisturizer over 5 years ago, and I have to say, it's my favorite, even amongst expensive brands. The scent is subtle and natural. Your skin becomes less dry and it has a firming effect. The ingredients are skin friendly, which is a major plus. I hope they never stop making this cream. It truly transformed my face..in a good way \ud83d\udc4d",

After reading reviews from others, I was worried it would be a heavy lotion but it's not. I was also worried about breaking out after using it as several people wrote that it caused breakouts on their face. I've used it for about a month now and at first everything seemed great. I didn't have any breakouts. And all of a sudden in the last week, I have. But who knows, it could be due to other factors (diet, cycle, etc.).I plan to finish off the bottle I have. Once the few breakout I have disappear, I'll try using it on my face again and see if I break out again. In the meantime, I'm using it on my hands at night because the lotion is so restorative. It's great on my hands and feet.I love knowing that there aren't any harsh chemicals in this and that it has a great rating on the EWG. So I really hope it works out! I'd recommend trying this out though. It feels so amazing, that I'm sure I'll continue to purchase it.",
