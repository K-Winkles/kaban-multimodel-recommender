                "reviewText": "This was the first summer I could really put this lotion to the test. I am a fair skinned red head who sunburns easily. I could apply this once or twice a day while in full sun for the day like at the beach and not burn. I may be a little red but it does not burn or peel like it usually does. I am very happy with this product that my friend turned me onto. It does not feel sticky or heavy on my face which i love. I hate regular sunscreen on my face it cakes up and feels weird. For some reason when I wear this every day I get little white heads randomly on my face so I slowed down and just use it on days I know I will be in the sun a lot and have no had that problem. There's no weird scent to it which is nice for my sensitive skin. I will keep buying this face lotion for sure. This bottle has lasted me all summer for me and my kids on their faces when swimming/beach time and it is almost out now. So definitely worth the money for how much you get and how little you need to use for it to work wonderfully.",

                "reviewText": "One week on the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting line with the Total Effects Nourishing Cream Facial Cleanser and Olay Eyes, i.e. AM: 1. Total Effects Cream Cleanser; 2. Regenerist Micro-sculpting Serum; 3. Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream with SPF 30 (this very one!); 4. Olay Eyes Ultimate Eye Cream OR Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Eye Swirl // PM: Total Effects Cream Cleanser; 2. Regenerist Miracle Boost; 3. Regenerist Anti-Aging Micro-Sculpting moisturizer; 4. well... Avene Physiolift Eyes, and I can definitely see facial improvement! Just to explain - I'm 34, mentally stopped at 25, smoker, only water, coffee and beer drinker, fair complexion, with a combination of mostly dry and normal, but sensitive skin, on a 6-7 hr sleep routine during the week and catching up during the weekend, always healthy eating, but currently engaged in a major, but not dramatic, weight-loss routine (13 kg lost since March this year, at least 12 to follow the 13 in their own sweet time), drink around 2-4 litres of water a day. Now, I have always had overall dry skin and hair, but I recently noticed the under-eye lids getting puffy and wrinkly, some crow feet taking shape, along with my expression \"Pi lines\" between the eyes and on my forehead...I mentally stopped at 25, so I can't be freaking looking more! so, upon extensive research I went with Olay, both Regenerist and Total Effects lines. I have only used the Regenerist products so far + the Total Effects cream cleanser which doesn't have sulfates (I have the Regenerist cream cleanser as well, but that has sulfates...so I'm still reluctant about that touching my dry face...)+the Olay Eyes Ultimate Cream+Olay Regenerist Eye Swirl once+Avene Physiolift Eyes ONLY at night, ALL for just one week... and my skin hasn't been so soft since before I started smoking, the Pi lines are somewhat less visible (don't get me wrong! they are still there if I frown, but finer on a chill face) and the EYES... well... less puffiness, the 2-3 creases under each eye have slightly improved, the dark circles are immediately toned down to a lighter shade, but I'm not sure which product did what... I dabbed on the Avene Physiolift at night, as that has a retinol (vitamin A) derivative (RETINALDEHYDE, good for more sensitive skin) and sunlight-eecky, but I have also put on the Olay Eyes Ultimate Cream and it's slightly pigmented (could work as light concealer) and creamy, but not oily (BTW! none of the Olay products I've used are oily and they're fast-absorbing), and the Olay Regenerist Eye Swirl (I've only used it once during the day) has some mica which reflects the light...But the Regenerist micro-sculpting line seems to be working smoothly after just one week! I will, however, give it a full month before testing the Total Effects line...",
