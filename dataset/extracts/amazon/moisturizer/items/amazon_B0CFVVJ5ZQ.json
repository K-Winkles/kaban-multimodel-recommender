So when searching I came across this particular brand and read some reviews and also noted that it\u2019s ingredients are very clean. The less chemicals I use on my body as I get older and more sensitive skin issues the better. And my skin reacts quickly as I get older!I immediately started using it and one thing I noticed almost immediately was my pores on my face reacted immediately to the serium along with the fine lines I have. That response alone was enough to make me review this product! I usually review products when I\u2019m disappointed in the results! Another plus is my facial redness has decreased significantly. I use it morning and nightly and under my makeup because it blurs my pores and fine lines so my makeup doesn\u2019t settle in them. The best serum I\u2019ve used so far!",

I now use it nightly followed by a good moisturizer. Just a few seconds to apply.. Beauty products that actually work are usually so expensive! It\u2019s great to find one this reasonably priced that works! Will definitely continue to use!",

I wash, air dry my face then apply my favorite moisturizer on top. You can also use this to stamp your face as the product is not greasy, nor thick. It applies smoothly on the face and dries nice. I was not surprised though when I read where it was produced at. None other than Beverly Hills, CA. Enough said for me anyway. Try this bottle it is a keeper.",
