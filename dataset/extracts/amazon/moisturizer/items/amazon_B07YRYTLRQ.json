                "reviewText": "I just ordered my second bottle. Would have purchased 2 or more had it not been the last one until they restocked!!! I first seen this lotion at my local tanning salon and was in love with the fragrance. I read on the bottle about all of the cool things it claims to do for your skin if used daily. It claimed to tighten, restore and help with aged skin, or to slow down the process. Also claims that it CAN help with body fat etc. Just the nice smell had me sold, because quite frankly, I do not believe in all of the gimmick's out there, nor do I completely even trust the beauty industry itself, because it is mostly gimmicks! My local salon wanted $45 a bottle. So, my first instinct, of course, Amazon! lol. Yup, my go-to for all of my overpriced necessities and wants! I get on here, and boom, it is a whopping $20. Yes, the price did raise by two bucks since my last purchase, but compared to $45, I would be crazy. I have applied this lotion from face to toe almost every single day after my evening daily shower for right at two months now. Wow! This lotion is some kind of awesomeness!!! I am telling you the honest consumer truth! My skin has completely changed, in a good way! We tan at the salon about three to four months of the year (the warmer months) and give our skin and wallet a break during fall and winter. So naturally my skin gets exposure to the Uva, thus causing some damage. You may not be able to visibly see the damage, but you can feel the difference on your skins surface after a few tanning sessions. Almost a leathery type feels to it, super dry and just not soft. After a week of using this my softness was back! After close to a month, my skin has never felt or looked so healthy! I have a \"glow\" about me. The appearance of any stretch marks that i have on my hips are Barely noticeable after a month of daily use, and when I sit down my thighs would create the cellulite look, that is now almost unnoticeable! My tan has never been so natural looking. I've also noticed since using, that it has extended my tan, thus I do not have to lay as often as I did in all of the years prior. Usually, I would have to lay at least 2 or 3 times per week to keep my tan, but now I lay once a week or 2 times to 3 in a three-week period because my tan doesn't fade as fast. This lotion claims to do many, many good things for your skin. So far, I cannot refute this claim! I more than recommend this lotion to any and everyone! The scent may be a little much for some, but I find it quite pleasant. Clean and fresh! I do recommend using this religiously on a daily basis, at least once a day to get the max benefits! I promise, once you use it for a day or two, you will find yourself looking forward to slathering it all over!",

If yours does not pop open all you have to do is unscrew the pump top hold pump and turn the cap part until it releases.I have been doing Red Light Therapy now for almost a month now (I have Lyme disease) and I use this AFTER my session. I also get a massage once a month and my massage therapist commented on my skin and how great it looked and felt. I don't know if it is from the Red Light or the lotion but either one the combination works!I would highly recommend this lotion on its own or with the RLT it goes on smooth doesn't leave a greasy feeling.",

I use it after red light and tanning, and use their other product pre-red light. It smells nice and feels great going on, but by the time I get home I want to shower because it leaves a sortof sticky, dusty, heavy feel. My skin does feel hydrated, though that may be just because I\u2019m using lotion regularly. Aside from that, I don\u2019t see any benefit to using it. All this said, I\u2019ve only had it for about a month, so if in another month or two that changes, I will update my review. The bottle is quite large and will last a good while I believe, I just don\u2019t love the after feel, and probably lose any benefit by having to wash it off!",

Reported it immediately they sent me a new bottle the very next day. When you twist it to open it doesn't do anything. You have to take off the top wipe off the spout or even put a rag around the bottom part of it hold it tightly and then turn the pump and the correct direction. My suggestion if in doubt look up YouTube videos how to open the pump. Now I have no issues it's great hope this helps",

Examples would be Promoting Fat LossTightens & TonesReduces celluliteIt works great as a moisturizing lotion though but you can get those pretty much anywhere for a better price & that smell way better as well. The smell is ok. Nothing that lingers in the nostrils of those you walk by though! I like to leave some fragrance behind when I walk by people lol!",

This is the exact same product but the price is WAY BETTER!! But this stuff smells amazing and makes my skin so so soft! It\u2019s a medium-feel moisturizer, not thick like Nivea, but not too light like Jergens. It adds a bit of a sheen to your skin, which I love, bc #1, makes me look more tan and #2, makes my skin \u201cglisten\u201d. But I promise, it\u2019s not like a shiney look, it\u2019s a very nice moisturizer!",
