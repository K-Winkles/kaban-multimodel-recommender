                "reviewText": "Skincare is a big thing for me, so I don't mind investing money into the right products like this one. 3 stars for scent because it's unscented and 3 stars for value because, honestly, it's a little pricey. Very moisturizing and leaves a matte finish on the skin; not oily at all, which is a problem I have with certain other brands. I feel confident this product has good stuff in it to protect my skin and help fend off signs of aging. For me, this product isn't a game changer but, if you're used to using low end products, this for sure will make a noticeable difference. Just purchased my 2nd bottle of this stuff a few weeks ago and I'm about 1/3rd of the way through it and still loving it. Highly recommend.",

This lotion is smooth, soft, and odorless, so I don't feel like I'm wearing some gross smelly mask - just a refreshed vibrant face that has all my friends asking \"How is it that you never age?\" I'll never tell...",

I especially like that it is seemingly odorless and not greasy. It absorbs quickly and feels good on the face. It also smoothed out some wrinkles which at 67 yrs old, that's a good thing. Its worth a try.",
