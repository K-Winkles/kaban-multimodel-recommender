It\u2019s moisturizing which is great for dry winter months. Goes on thick but absorbs very well. Good natural coverage. Does not look like foundation. Feels like a thicker lotion. Requires cover up and or powder if trying to cover more specific imperfections like dark circles or pimples. Planning to repurchase because I\u2019m running low.",

The color tonality is a bit strong and the finish is more smooth, so it shines a bit (no glitter, but more like a \u201cliquid\u201d shine), so be prepared for that. This product does not tend to create a natural look, but that is not a knock against it if you have no problem with make up",

                "reviewText": "I like what honest beauty stands for and have been trying out a bunch of their products to find out what works for me. I am not someone who wears a lot of makeup but wanted to try this out just to have in my arsenal. Sunscreen plus moisturizing benefits, with tinted coverage? I'm all about fewer steps in my morning routine.Color: My skin tone is pretty close to Jessica Alba's, so based on other reviews noting that these tend to run dark I determined I was between fair and light. Ended up getting fair and now use this product as concealer to lighten and color correct my dark circles. I could probably get away with light for the rest of my face in the summer. Fair works great for me for concealer, and I love it.Size: At first I was disappointed when the product arrived and I realized it's a decently small tube - especially considering it's supposed to be used for the whole face, not just undereyes - but I quickly learned a little goes a long, long way. I use a half pump to cover my undereyes, so the tube will last me a long time.Consistency/Coverage: I would say the consistency is thinner and lighter than I expected, and it looks pretty dewy on the skin. Gotta give it a little time to soak in, and throw some powder on if you don't want to be too dewy/if you don't want it to crease. It's not totally full coverage, but I can easily build it up with another layer for when I want to wear more makeup than my regular everyday. Goes onto the skin easily with my fingers, it can really melt in. Love that I still look like a human and not an airbrushed doll. Works like a charm. When I first started using the product, it would pill on my skin, but I quickly realized I was simply not prepping my skin the right way - it doesn't go well onto dry skin. We all should be moisturizing before makeup, anyway :) Ever since I figured that out, it works like a charm.Overall: I love that I feel like I'm putting extra sunscreen protection on my sensitive undereye areas in addition to simply covering those dark circles. Apparently there's also vitamin C in it, but I don't think there's much, so just a small added bonus. Surprisingly great value. Thanks again, honest beauty!",

Once blended out, my skin looks good! it lasts a pretty good time too, without looking cakey and dry. good buy!",
