                "reviewText": "Review of the Proactive Green Tea Moisturizer. Wow, I've been using this moisturizer for 2 weeks now and what a difference. I found it through a Google search, looking for moisturizer for middle age, red, oily, combo skin that is prone to small breakouts. Add to that rough skin that has come in the last year or so. I've never found anything that works. I didn't even change my other products, but now I may change my cleanser. Just the moisturizer has taken the redness down a lot, I'm not breaking out, my skin is smooth again, and my skin does not become the oil slick mess that it usually does by noon time. Even at bed time, NO OIL. And it's not even over drying my skin. AND it's Winter! I sure hope this lasts, because I'm quite happy. The scent is quite strong at first, and normally I cannot do scents due to allergies (I buy all fragrance free products). However, I stuck it out with this and found that this isn't clogging up my nose or making me unable to sleep. So it's fine. I do wish it were fragrance free, but still give 5 stars for how well it's working for me. It soaks in quickly. My make-up goes on just fine over top.",

There are plenty of moisturizers that you can get that are just as good for half the price. I got this moisturizer on sale for 50% off during the Amazon Prime sale.

But I'm older now and my skin is changing, plus I wear a mask most of the day now thanks to COVID. Not only has my face been breaking out but, I wear glasses, and the combo of my glasses, hot breath, and mask has made me breakout in the skin just under my eyes. And it's been bad! I started doing some research and decided to get products that are oil free and some other words that escape me as I write this. I ordered a ton of products to try and so far this is my favorite! It feels so good! It's soothing and refreshing. It's everything my face needed! And those breakouts under my eyes are almost all the way gone! I can't believe I fought the facial beauty game for so long because I thought what I was doing was working. These products are great. This gel doesn't feel thick like other moisturizers but it is still moisturizing. Very sheer. I don't often wear makeup but I think it would be ideal for under foundation and powder.",
