Their description of \"Mattifying\" means it covers small imperfections due to acne breakouts; and as I said above it minimizing pores.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this moisturizer to help with my oiliness when I go out. I try to buy lightweight moisturizers so it doesn\u2019t leave a build up on my face and cause excess oil or breakouts. I bought this due to some reviews saying it helped on there oily skin a when I first tried it, I was amazed. Fast forward about the 4th time using it, going outside of the house. I decided to go out to grab a bite to eat an put this on about an hour before I was to go out. My face started to get oily again on my forehead and nose. I know the directions say you can replace up to 3 times a day so no biggie just added a little more and oiliness was gone. Bam!! My skin did not become overly oily and it held for about a hour again, got home washed my face. Had it on less than 3 hours, touched up twice. But after a few days of using it here and there, I started breaking out more. I thought it was just random so I stopped using it just in case and my acne started going away, no new breakouts. I waited about a week or so an tried again. It was fine for a few days but constantly having to reapply or clean my face throughly to start again to avoid the excess oil an it bought my breakouts back days after. I mainly breakout on my cheeks and my neck. I\u2019ve been using this for about 5 weeks just to give a reference on time. I do have to say I have mixed reviews on this.Pros1) it does take away the oil effortlessly..2) it doesn\u2019t smell bad3) it\u2019s small an convenient to take anywhere for a touch up.4) it goes nicely under makeup ( I tried once)5) it\u2019s creamy an smooth.6) price is goodCons1) you have to reapply numerously2) some might not like the chemical smell3) due to reapplying, you might run out the product quicker4) potential breakouts ( I have but some might some may not.)5) Not sure how it would hold up in higher temperatures outdoors/indoors. ( it\u2019s been cooler where I live so can\u2019t say if you will reapply more.6) not sure how it works to reapply with makeup on. I did not leave mine on long enough to know.Overall it\u2019s a good product if you may not be sensitive to breakouts or you feel like reapplying might be an issue.",

I've tried using other products of moisturizers and they felt HEAVY and sticky. This is VERY light weight which I appreciate. That is all\u263a\ufe0f7 month update: I tend to sweat profusely especially in the summer time around my scalp and forehead. I waited to update to see how to use this best. While using this product i found that using a smaller amount was best. If you tend to sweat a lot like me, use toner then apply a pea - pea and a 1/2 size amount of moisturizer. I still tend to sweat till it runs into my eyes, but using less moisturizer prevented the product from running into my eye while sweating.I use this before putting on my makeup and it doesn't feel caked.I have oily skin prone to break outs and wanted to start using a cream after washing my face due to feeling dry afterwords. I dont have a beauty routine, rarely use makeup, nor informed on beauty trends etc but I wanted to start taking better care of my appearance lately.I compared different pricing for (oily skin/acne control) face moisturizers both online and my local Walgreens and Walmart. Note: the cream I was looking for had to be safe for sensitive skin as I suffer from eczema and remembered Cetaphil was one of the brands my doctor said was more natural and safer.I've been using this for about 2 weeks now.Result: it doesn't burn and no signs of inflammation. It doesn't smell great but it helps A LOT with not feeling dry from washing. It does not mattify my skin as it states and my oilyness is about the same throughout my regular work days.But it did do something when I saw myself in my review mirror when the sun was on my face. I noticed my face shined all over where I placed this cream. I just learned of the glass face look beauty trend and it looks slightly similar to that effect from the use of this cream on my face. I've had compliments on my skin from clients/family which is nice to hear.I usually wash my face with a acne face wash for oily skin, use a toner and a brightening eye serum from my local Ross store, and this cream to \"seal\" it all in.I admit I tend to touch my face out of habit which causes a pimple to come out.I will be editing my review in the summer as I tend to sweat profusely from my scalp/face and will note if this cream if bothersome or not.Overall it helps with dryness and it helps my skin look nice and shiny (vibrant?) in the sun so I'm happy with the product!",
