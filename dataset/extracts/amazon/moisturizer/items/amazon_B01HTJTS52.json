        "description": "Vaseline Intensive Care Essential Healing is now Vaseline Intensive Care Nourishing Moisture. Made with Pure Oat Extract and Ultra-Hydrating Lipids, Vaseline Intensive Care Nourishing Moisture Lotion helps keep your skin looking healthy and hydrated. With daily exposure to environmental triggers (like wind, lack of humidity, and sun), skin\u2019s natural moisture barrier can break down, allowing water to escape the skin. But the Ultra-Hydrating lipids in our Nourishing Moisture lotion fortify the skin barrier and replenish moisture to allow the skin\u2019s natural barrier to recover. Vaseline Intensive Care Nourishing Moisture Lotion, formulated with Ultra-Hydrating Lipids and Pure Oat Extract, locks in moisture and deeply nourishes for healthy-looking skin. This body moisturizer is clinically tested to provide 90% more moisture (vs. untreated skin). This body lotion for dry skin absorbs fast and provides 48-hour non-greasy moisture. Use this dermatologist-tested body lotion daily on dry, rough skin for stronger, noticeably healthier skin. This Vaseline lotion bottle is made of 50% recycled plastic. Our ambition is to get to 100% recycled plastic in the near future. Since 2018, we've used 337 Metric Tons of recycled plastic across the Vaseline product portfolio in North America. Our Intensive Care range works to heal dry skin from deep within. Explore the range of Vaseline products, including Vaseline lotion, and enjoy the healing power of Vaseline. Vaseline has a range of products to help heal, soothe, and moisturize all skin. We believe skin health is essential for well-being. That\u2019s why Vaseline is working towards giving everybody, everywhere, access to the skin care they need.",
