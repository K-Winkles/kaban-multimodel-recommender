I am so grateful I found it, because all of the ingredients are high quality and natural. It\u2019s best to put this on dry skin (not wet), as it won\u2019t blend well otherwise. It smells amazing and my skin absorbs it so well. You only need one or half a pump depending on your skin type. My skin feels smooth and LOOKS glowing. & it lasts the whole day! I\u2019m only 27, but I feel younger when I put this moisturizer on lol. Definitely will be getting again!",

The only issue I feel I have is the smell, for some odd reason it smells like bubble gum BUT it could just be me. I feel like my skin needed this because there\u2019s a VISIBLE difference in my skin, it seems more \u201cplump\u201d, brighter and smoother. I\u2019ll be purchasing this product again when I run out!",

Kind of smells like the perfume that lilys give off and I\u2019m very allergic to those. I\u2019ve smelled this in other face creams before. Maybe hyaluronic acid? It\u2019s definitely not something I want to put on my face with this scent. I\u2019m returning because of this and it\u2019s not thick like people mentioned. Might be good for others but not for me.",
