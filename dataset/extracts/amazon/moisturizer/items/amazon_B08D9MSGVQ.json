I read the reviews on this a few times in different places and put it in my cart for months. It went on sale so I figured it must be the time to finally get it and I am so glad I did. The texture is great and it soaks in so fast and leaves no weird feeling afterwards at all. It just feels like my face but not dry! And there\u2019s no scent or anything that irritates my skin either. I\u2019ve been telling people about it for a few days now, it is that good.",

                "reviewText": "I love this moisturizer. I've been using it for a few months and my dermatologist remarked how nice my skin looked on my last visit. It is a bit more \"gloppy\" than some moisturizers, which I like because it goes on so smoothly and feels kind of silky. Absorbs well and has little scent which is great because I easily get headaches from scented products. My face doesn't feel greasy or coated after applying which is a big plus.",

I decided to give this one a chance after reading the reviews, and I'm so glad I did! A little bit goes a long way, and it feels so silky going on. I don't have particularly sensitive skin so I can't attest to that, but it feels great going on and I can't imagine it being irritating at all. The smell is also super mild which I really like as sometimes scents can trigger headaches for me.Just for reference, I have combination skin (on the dry side lately due to cold weather) and am not prone to acne.",
