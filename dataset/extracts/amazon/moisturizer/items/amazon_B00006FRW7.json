I started to experiment with several different and my acne got so bad. Eventually I tried this, and while I wish it had a lil more of a moisturizing component, it has been the best product I've used so far that moisturizes and doesn't cause me to break out. It's pricey for a grocery store brand, but worth it for the effectiveness.",
