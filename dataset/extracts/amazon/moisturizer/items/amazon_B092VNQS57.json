I needed something moisturizing, didn't break me out, and didn't smell too strong. This moisturizer is amazing! I have been using it for about a month now and even though it's been super dry here, I have not been flaking. I was flaking pretty badly around my nose area and the corner of my mouth but ever since I've been using this, I haven't experienced any flaking at all! It feels creamy but not too thick or oily. It absorbs into my skin really well. Feels hydrating but not oily. I have been loving this! There really isn't a scent. I wanted something that fit within a budget with quality ingredients. This is it!",

This is the best moisturizer I've ever tried. First of all, this kind of container is better for preserving the ingredients. Second, it's good for sensitive skin, using no fragrance, but it still has a slight smell that's pleasant. Third, it is very moisturizing, for someone with dry skin like myself, but it's not overly thick, and blends in fast, you don't have to spend five minutes making sure that everything is blended into your skin. It's great for all seasons as well, not leaving your face with a heavy, greasy feel or drying out quickly.",

                "reviewText": "This stuff is amazing, and now I'm interested in trying out other products by KLARIS! For a quick background, I'm 20 years old and have been suffering from sensitive/dry/acne prone skin since I was a freshman in high school. I have A really pale complexion and my face gets red and irritated very easily if I use a product that is too harsh. BUT THIS KLARIS MOISTURIZER IS THE BEST THING THAT I'VE EVER TRIED!I used to use a sunscreen/moisturizer that my dermatologist prescribed me. It was working for a while during the fall, but then winter came along and I started to notice that the product she prescribed to me wasn't getting rid or smoothing the dry/flaky patches around my nose and mouth. But I still kept using it because I thought 'the doctor knows best.' When I went to see her again in early spring, I told her about the problem, and she just prescribed the same product but with less sunscreen and more moisturizer...So I followed her directions, but then noticed that the stuff was starting to burn my skin...IT SERIOUSLY FELT LIKE HELL HAD DROPPED A FIRE BOMB ON MY FACE! And it not only didn't get rid of the dry patches but also made my face very irritable and itchy. So I took matters into my own hands and did some research.I've always been a fan of Korean beauty products, and so I looked into specific brands and products that were orientated around dry/sensitive skin. KLARIS is a brand that is known for creating great products for people with sensitive and dry skin, so I decided to give this KLARIS Rich Moist Soothing Cream a go. AND I REPEAT, THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. It hydrates and smooths my skin, getting rid of any dry areas and does not irritate at all! It also feels very light on the skin, which is a plus for me at least, as I don't like putting a lot of stuff on my face, including skin products and makeup.Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has problems with dry/sensitive skin. It doesn't make me break out either! Highly, highly, highly recommend and I can't wait to try out more products from KLARIS!",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for calming, sensitive moisturizer that was thicker than my usual face lotion. NJ winter weather means heat blasting even if it\u2019s not super cold, so with the dry environment + upping my retinol at night, my face is feeling it. I was pleasantly surprised with how thick and moisturizing this was without feeling greasy/heavy. I was using two mid priced \u201ccalming\u201d face lotions + a moisturizing SPF and my face still felt tight. After applying this cream on damp skin my face felt much more comfortable and not tight at all. If you\u2019re using any retinols, tretinoin or post chem peel and need some relief, give this one a try. Seems to layer well under SPF without pilling.",

It\u2019s great for make up prep as well and really allows my skin to stay hydrated throughout the day. It really helped during the winter time as well!

I've been on the hunt for something similar and I think i may have found it with the Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream.A small amount glides across your face like butter and soaks in immediately without feeling greasy, but still leaving this sort of moisture barrier on the surface of your skin. I prefer to look dewy and glowy as i have very dry skin and this moisturizer leaves your skin looking plump and healthy. It does not break me out and i use it both morning and night but apply a little bit more at night to get a more nourishing finish. The price range is great and I love the squeeze tube packaging for sanitary reasons. The scent is subtle, almost like lemongrass or something, and does not cause irritation to my extremely sensitive skin whatsoever. The list of ingredients is actually readable and packed with amazing stuff. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOISTURIZER.",
