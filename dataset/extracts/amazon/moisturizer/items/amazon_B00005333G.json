No flakiness. My makeup went on smoothly. And it feels so good and clean. It does not feel like lotion. No grease. It is like a 2nd skin.And you can't beat it for the price! I would highly recommend!.",

                "reviewText": "Update: 3.27.18 - still going strong. While I have added alpha hydroxy to my skin regime, this is still my base (foundation) cream. I love it. I attached a picture of me in the aqua blue shawl with designs on it from 3.23.18 - taken by moi :-)Update: 11.30.17, I started using this cream at 43 and now I'm 49 and I absolutely still love it. Yes, it may have some chemicals in it (I'm honestly not clear but I bet someone can tell me) but I have tried to find another cream that is reasonably priced and I have yet to find it. I ordered a few creams that cost about $40 each and they did not make my skin look as nice. I like that dewey look and I like a light feel on my skin, the below pics show me with a very light foundation mixed into my cream. I will be ordering this cream until I find another one that's more natural (which may be never ha) AND makes my skin look as nice. Until then? I guess I'm dating a bad boy :-)I've been using this cream for about a year now, I'm 44, and due to an immune disorder, I have Vitiligo, a VERY mild version of it, meaning, I'm still fairly pale but my skin is uneven and my face is darker than it used to be. I used to have peaches and cream skin (Irish, German & Italian heritage) but when I moved to Texas, it seemed like my skin disorder was activated. Anyway, even tho' growing up I wanted darker skin and tanned (I grew up in Long Island), as I got older I really realized the natural beauty of your true skin color. Well, too late ;-( about 12 years after running around Lady Bird Lake here in Austin, I came home and my skin was a yellowish tint. It was almost as if I'd gotten a sunburn but it didn't really go away ;-(I immediately started to exfoliate as much as I could, and did my best to stay out of the sun but long story short, my skin was permanently darkened because my immune system was compromised. So back to this cream, Loreal has always been a good product and reasonably priced but I particularly like this cream because1. It feels very cooling and soft when it goes on2. No filmy feel to it on your skin3. I actually like that it's a little heavy in the sense it can make my skin a little oily looking but I prefer that to dry and cakey looking4. It's cheap!5. It seems to help with my slight discoloration and does NOT add to my yellowish tone that I have acquiredDo NOT get this product if you like your skin very matte or a bit dry - or IF you get this - you'll need foundation/powder - I don't use foundation powder - as much as I struggle with my skin color (mostly I notice it - not too many others) I don't like foundation. I like feeling natural and free with my skin.Overall? This is my favorite day cream.",

                "reviewText": "My skin is very FAIR being a redhead, Fair skin require light moisturizers. This Hydra renewal moisturizer is PERFECTION. The scent is hardly noticeable and pleasant. The gentle cream soaks into my skin and leaves it soft. I have had the product 3 days, and in the Colorado weather which is dry, this is PERFECTION. Not heavy, light, I am 70ish and wish to have something light to work with my schedule, not made-up or heavy creams. For LIGHT SKINNED people this is your CHOICE. FABULOUSLast, I am not sure if this is for those who have deep lines, I do not, given only3 days, if my few smile lines lighten, all the better.I recommend this product for LIGHT SKIN PEOPLE who have taken care of themselves both in eating good food, and limited makeup, no harsh lingering times in the sun. GREAT PRODUCT!! Soaks into my skin and leaves it naturally soft.",
