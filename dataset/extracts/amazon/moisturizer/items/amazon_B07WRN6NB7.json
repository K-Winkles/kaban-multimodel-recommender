No, +Retinol Vitamin C Moisturizer should be used as instructed, PM only. What is the difference between this and +Retinol Vitamin C Serum? While both are excellent products, +Retinol Vitamin C Moisturizer offers moisturization properties not provided by the serum. The serum is an excellent option for individuals who have oily skin but still want the benefits of Retinol. I have never used +Retinol before. As a beginner, should I start with the moisturizer or serum? As a beginner to Retinol, we recommend using the +Retinol Vitamin C Moisturizer first. This product offers moisturizing benefits to combat the drying and flaking commonly seen when skin is newly adjusting to Retinol usage. Use product 1-2x a week. I have the +Retinol Vitamin C Serum. Do you use that under the moisturizer or are they separately used? More does not mean better. Retinol is a strong active that can also cause dryness and flaking of skin. We recommend alternating usage of these products, i.e. +Retinol Vitamin C Moisturizer on one evening and +Retinol Vitamin C Power Serum on another. Does it help for hyperpigmentation? Yes! Retinol and Vitamin C are well known actives with brightening benefits. Retinol helps to increase skin cell turnover which thereby results in a diminished appearance of discoloration and spots. Vitamin C works to brighten and even skin tone!",

Just dull and dry, and, well, older. I've used Kate's face wash for a while, so I decided to check out her anti-aging stuff.I never thought I would pay this much for a face cream, but holy cow, is it worth every penny! I swear, my skin looks about 10 years younger, and I've only used it twice.It is a tad bit drying for me, so I am only using it 2x per week for now. The rest of the week I use a heavy duty moisturizing night cream. It's pretty incredible - I would recommend this product 100%!",
