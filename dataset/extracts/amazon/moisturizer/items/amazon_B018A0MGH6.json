There weren't any discounts but I wanted it shipped quickly so Amazon Prime it is! It\u2019s too soon to tell whether this product did any wonders for my skin as it has been only a week or two, BUT I can tell you through this seller - the moisturizer was legit and not a fake. I had the sample left over from Sephora and compared it closely just to make sure (you never know these days with Amazon with all the fake product reviews I've been reading), therefore I needed to be extra sure. I absolutely adored the light feel of the moisturizer and it wasn't heavy on my combination skin, especially when I layered plenty of products during my nighttime routine. Actually, I looked forward to it because of the scent. Who knew the combination of kale and spinach green tea could've produced such an amazing smell? I'm all for it. It was so light that one can even use it during the daytime. It hasn't caused any breakouts or clogging of pores, so it's good in my book! I'm giving it four stars for now but will gladly update once I've finished it to thoroughly gauge how well (or bad) it has done for my skin.",

This has made my skin feel so plump and soft, the first few days of using it I felt like a brand new person. I\u2019ve used first aid beauty, cerave, Tula, la roche posay, and so on and this has by far been my absolute favorite. It has a very light scent similar to their kale face wash, not too overpowering.",
