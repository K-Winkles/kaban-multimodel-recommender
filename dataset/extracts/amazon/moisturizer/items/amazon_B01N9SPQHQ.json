Dermatologists recommend applying your serum before your face moisturizer for optimum benefits. What is the difference between a face lotion and face cream? A face lotion typically has a lightweight texture, non-greasy, and ideal for oily, normal, or moderately dry skin. By contrast, a face cream typically has a rich texture, provide enhanced hydrating benefits, and is ideal for normal to very dry skin.",

                "reviewText": "LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It will be a repurchase.It is creamy, smooth, lightweight. It does not feel like an SPF product. It is so light and airy feeling.My skin: mid 40s, clear, NON acne Rosacea (just visible veins, some flushing), normal to dry skin, semi sensitive--though less so since incorporating skin barrier building and protecting ingredients (hence my love of La Roche Posay products).Yes, I love La Roche-Posay products. Seems there is something for everyone. I recommend checking out all they have to offer, and WHY. Such good ingredients. I have used their Toleraine creamy face cleanser, cicaplast baume, hydrating mask, assortment of sunscreens, and most recently this Toleraine Double Repair Face Moisturizer with SPF 30.I tend to have a pretty solid skin care routine for night. For day time, it is pretty much whatever I feel like using, with emphasis on SPF. Most of the year I can do a combo of various morning products plus my SPF, but when it gets extra hot.. I just go with SPF because I will just sweat off good product. I am more apt to reapply during day as well as sometimes rinse my hot sticky face and then reapply. I figured using a product that is both moisturizer AND SPF, as well as contain some other skin loving, skin barrier building goodies would be perfect. I immediately checked out the offerings of La Roche Posay, and am thrilled to have made this purchase.Not to scare you off, as it didn't me, but I want to share.. At first, my skin seemed to flush pretty hard upon initial application. It didn't deter me from further use, since there is nothing in it that is troublesome. However, it is a new product for my skin, and it contains niacinamide which my skin never encountered before. Not too concerned, I continued to use it every morning. It seems to be even better as time goes on. I have been using it every single day for nearly a month. My skin didn't get red beyond the first couple of uses and seemed to simmer down a lot. My skin has also seemed mildly greasy at first (a never on my dry skin!), but that too simmered down with repeated use. It looks really good, or extra good these days!!!!! My skin simply feels happily moisturized and at no point during day does it feel dry, nor does it feel greasy (not sure what that initial reaction was). I feel like i have done something GOOD FOR MY SKIN when I use this. Hard no to recommend it :)I have used it alone, I have used it over serums. I have used it under make up. I dont often wear make up, so I cant report much about my experience. When I do, I tend to use a little less than normal, let it set for awhile, then go back and add make-up. Usually my make up also has SPF.So yeh.. give it a try. Hope this helped. Take care :)",

                "reviewText": "As someone who appreciates the finer details in both technology and skincare, I recently tried the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer and was thoroughly impressed. My daily routine, which often involves long hours in front of a computer, requires a skincare product that not only rejuvenates but also protects.The Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer stands out for its lightweight formula that is easily absorbed into the skin. Its non-greasy texture is a major plus, particularly for those long days spent at the University of Florida where I work on advanced computing projects. The moisturizer provided my skin with much-needed hydration without any heaviness or residue.What I particularly appreciate about this product is its commitment to sensitive skin. The fragrance-free and non-comedogenic formula aligns well with my preference for skincare products that are gentle yet effective. In the realm of software development and research, where attention to detail is paramount, this moisturizer echoes a similar ethos in skincare.The moisturizer's dual-action approach, combining ceramide-3 and prebiotic thermal water, is like integrating the best of two worlds, akin to the front-end and back-end development in software. It repairs the skin barrier and restores skin's natural protective properties, which is essential for someone like me who spends a significant amount of time in air-conditioned environments.In conclusion, the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer is a product I would highly recommend. Its blend of science-backed ingredients and user-friendly application makes it a top choice for professionals seeking a reliable and effective skincare solution. It's a small, yet significant step towards self-care amidst a busy lifestyle.",

Me gusta mucho, es bueno para piel sensible y con acne. Es hidratante.
