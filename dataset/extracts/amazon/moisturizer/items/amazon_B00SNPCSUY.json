This Cera Ve cream is a winner when it comes to moisturizing and hydrating your skin. It also has working benefits in it like peptide complex , niacinamide and ceramides.

It doesn't take much, either, so it will last a long time! It isn't too thick and isn't greasy. I am 47 and have tried different face creams and this is my favorite now!",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new moisturizer with simple ingredients but strong enough to fight skin dryness from starting retinol. I have sensitive skin, redness, acne prone, super oily but also super dry. This stuff is amazing! I use it morning and night now while my skin is in the peeling stage with retinol. I don't feel any burning on application which sometimes happens with my sensitive skin. It doesn't have any scent in my opinion. It's very thick so a little goes a long way but it moisturizes sooo well. It definitely leaves a residue but it doesn't interfere with makeup application for me and most people would probably only use it as a night cream anyway. Worth the price, would recommend.",
