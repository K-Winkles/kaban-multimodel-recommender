A lot of times it would clog my large pores, or I would have white heads along with dry/ red blotchy skin. Then I researched some of Paula\u2019s Choice products. I picked out what I thought fit my type of skin. After some adjusting my skin has been the best it has ever been. I don\u2019t have big blackheads, white heads, dry skin, or red blotches. And it feels great. In the morning I use the face wash, eye cream, and the daily hydrating fluid lotion. At night I use the face wash, the toner (make sure you let your face completely dry afterwards before moving on), I use 3 drops of the boost (let that dry), then I put on the night oil free moisturizer.Every Tuesday night I use the exfoliate instead of the toner. You let it dry completely. It takes about 15 minutes. I usually don\u2019t put anything on after using the exfoliate because I am too tired to wait for it to dry. It works for me.Then about once a month or every two weeks on a Friday night, after using the toner, I use exfoliate rinse off treatment. Afterwards I finish with the boost and night moisturizer.",

                "reviewText": "The good thing about this moisturizer is that when you\u2019re rubbing it in, it feels very luxurious. It\u2019s a thicker formula and just feels so good to rub into your face. I\u2019ve never really noticed a scent, so at the very least that could be a good thing to some people.However, my face will barely feel moisturized even right after I\u2019m done rubbing it in, and within 10 minutes my face feels pretty dry. I have combination skin and hormonal acne so have been on the hunt for a night time moisturizer that works to keep me moisturized and keep breakouts at bay. Sadly, this one isn\u2019t for me.EDIT: I've actually started to come around to this moisturizer LOL. I think I was using too little... lately I've been doing a sizable amount about the size of a penny, and that seems to make me feel much more moisturized.",

It absorbs instantly and is hydrating without being greasy at all! It is specified as a nighttime treatment but I have been using it during the day under my sunscreen and it is wonderful. Will continue to try more products in this skin care line.",
