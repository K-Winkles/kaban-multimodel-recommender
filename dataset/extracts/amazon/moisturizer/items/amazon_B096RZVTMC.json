                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve already bought this moisturizer twice. I cannot go without it. My skin is oily acne-prone and very sensitive. This moisturizer not only hydrates my skin, it also soothes and calms any irritation or redness I have from using too many actives. (Which I do frequently, I use adapalene gel and benzoyl peroxide and azeliac acid.) It\u2019s also sooo oily skin friendly. I believe the cream is water based so it doesn\u2019t leave a shiny film on my face, but my face also doesn\u2019t get oily at all throughout the day. I don\u2019t breakout from it at all either. I guess you could say it leaves a matte finish. With that said, I will continue to purchase this moisturizer!!",

Great quantity also which is double anything I can get in my local pharmacy so I will get great use out of this. I appreciated the little cap to keep the cream in the container so it wouldn't spill if I were to travel with it as well as the little scoop to prevent you putting your fingers in the cream so it can remain uncontaminated for longer.Loved Etude House products ever since visiting Korea and would purchase again!",

I've used it for 3 days now and I already noticed my red ( I have rocesea) cheeks are less irritated, my pores have gotten smaller, and overall smoother skin. I'm definitely going to try the other products of this skincare line and possibly switch to Soon Jung!",
