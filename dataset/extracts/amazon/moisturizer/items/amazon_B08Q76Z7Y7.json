I prefer to use a heavier product at night and thought I would give this a try. It's perfect--it's just heavy enough for the warm weather, there is no scent, and it is soothing for my skin and has not caused any breakouts. This balm version comes with less product than the cream, only 30ml with this balm vs the 50ml with the cream. For me, the price and size of the product is worth it.",

                "reviewText": "I'm so impressed with this brand, especially at such a good price point. I got the cream and the toner from this line and both are everything I could've asked for. The cream does come in a pretty tiny jar but that's not false advertising or anything, I just have no concept of size. It's deeply moisturizing and does leave a glowy sheen for a few minutes until it fully sinks in, but I swear my skin feels so bouncy and nourished all day. I use this more as a night creak because it is so nourishing and I live in a very hot climate. I find that if I wear this during the day in the heat I'll start sweating it off and I can actually feel the occlusive ingredients in my sweat- like my sweat will take on the consistency of a hydrating toner. That's pretty neat because I get a tangible idea of just how hydrating this stuff is, but I kinda need it to stay on my skin. So yeah, nighttime/winter cream for sure. That said, it doesn't feel at ALL heavy or greasy. The formulation is super luxurious for how cheap it is. I can also say the cica in here really makes a difference as I am a trans man and my beard is coming in for the first time, so I'm dealing with some pretty gnarly beard itch. This calms it right down.The toner is also wonderful but it's a very light watery consistency and I find I have to cup my hands together and splash my face with it and then really tap it in to get the most out of it. You can use a cotton pad to swipe it over the skin but it's so thin that it soaks into the pad really fast and I feel like I'm wasting product.Sorry about the long review but I love these products",

                "reviewText": "I have very sensitive and dry skin right now due to retinol and other actives. Normally, when I\u2019m experiencing flareups like this, I would use La Roche Posay's Cicaplast Baume, but it wasn\u2019t available anywhere for a while, so I just ordered a different cica balm instead and I\u2019m so glad I did. This balm is buttery soft unlike Cicaplast and doesn\u2019t have to be warmed up before applying. It just melts into my skin and feels non-greasy. There\u2019s no added fragrance but it\u2019s not scent-free. It smells a bit industrial actually. The balm contains a lot of healing, calming properties, but the tea tree oil may not be suitable for ultra sensitive skin and around the eyes. The packaging is ok. I prefer a tube or air tight containers, but since it\u2019s small, I\u2019ll just finish it before it gets too oxidized. Overall, it\u2019s a very good moisturizer when combined with hydrating toner and serum. I highly recommend it.",

Makes my skin smooth, soft, and hydrated. So far it has worked well with all my different makeup. I'm considering signing up for the subscription because it's so good and I don't want to be without it.",
