                "reviewText": "It sounds nuts, but I find most moisturizers don't moisturize. They are either too light or just sit on top of the skin. It doesn't claim to be antiwrinkle, but hydrated, elastic skin looks younger and radiant. You get a lot of product for 12 bucks, and be generous with the amount you use. Finding a quality fragrance free, clean ingredient face cream has not been easy, even at a higher price point. It doesn't pill and is not waxy. It is neither runny nor thick; more like a body lotion consistency. I am so happy I gave this a chance.",

Being acne prone, sensitive, and fighting signs of aging, finding a moisturizer that's right for me is nothing short of a nightmare. My daughter has even started to use it and loves it too. It takes a little bit of work to get it rubbed in to my skin in some areas. I don't wear a lot of makeup, so I can't speak much to the priming benefits of it, but as a moisturizer it does it's job wonderfully and most importantly DOESN'T BREAK ME OUT! I also use a lot of actives and rotate retinol in and out, so my skin can get super dry and flaky. I was having issues with dry spots in my morning routine because of this, so I was really looking for a moisturizer that would combat that. So acne prone, sensitive skin friends - rejoice because this just may be your new holy grail! Also, the price point is so, so reasonable.",
