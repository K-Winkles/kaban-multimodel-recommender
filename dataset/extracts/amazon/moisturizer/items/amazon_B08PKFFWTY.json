                "reviewTitle": "Not the best...",
                "reviewText": "First thing first, many people complained about the moisturizer balling up while application. We need to realise two things. This product does not contain any silicone and contains oat extract. Naturally, the application is going to be a tad bit difficult. But let's accept the fact we love Minimalist because they don't use silicone, paraben, essential oil and other harsh ingredients.The solution to easy application is take a very small amount. Now apply over by moving in short strokes either moving upward or downward. Now again take very small amount and apply by stroking in opposite direction. Now massage gently in circles. That's it.It gives a bit of irritation which lasted for few minutes.I have combination skin type.This could last somewhere around two months if you use regularly twice in a day.Skin doesn't stay hydrated longer. Needs application every 4-5 hours. Its gonna be a huge problem if you use sunscreen regularly.The main problem with this product is sweating post application.This won't suit for most people for use during daytime. Perfect for night time use.Final verdict: Not the worst. Nor the best. If you bought it, use it at night time. For daytime use, skip this.Thanks for reading.Update : I hated this moisturizer as much as everybody does due to the difficulty with application and shorter span of hydration. But recently I found some good techniques. If you use rosehip oil or retinol serum with squalane base or just squalane oil alone, you cannot apply the oil on moist face as the oil and water are immiscible and while application, oil will push out the water from the skin.My suggestion is, apply your retinol serum or rosehip oil on dry skin. Wait for 30 minutes while the oil enters deep in to the skin. Now apply this moisturizer on top of the oil. The application is super smooth. No balling up. Superb and longer moisturization. Better than many sleeping mask. And your skin doesn't look dull too.Use the same technique during day time too. Instead of retinol/rosehip oil serum, use plain squalane oil.",

This moisturiser is really cooling on the skin and moisturises well as it has enough humectants and emollients. Oats is also very good and soothing for the skin and so is sepicalm. My only issue is it can make my skin feel oily if I apply it during the day but it works well for a night moisturiser. It also helps repair skin from any sort of damage or dryness. It is very well made, it\u2019s one of the best moisturisers available in Indian market right now and at this reasonable price. Must try",

                "reviewText": "Okay guys n girls. I have a very oily Tzone and kind of dry cheeks. (Combination skin) I read reviews of this cream on every available platform and I was running out of my moisturizer. I love their Vitamin C serum and wanted to try something else from them. So even though a lot of reviews said it's not for oily skin, but the brand says it is, I took it at face value n bought it.So here's my review:I will probably take a year to finish this \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02As I opened the jar I thought such less quantity! Then I applied it on my hand and it has a great spread. You need verrrry little to cover your whole face.Now the consistency is deceptively light and gel like, you can't tell what it's like from reviews! It looks light and moisturizing on video! But once you put it on. Oh man \ud83d\ude02 it's too thick for me. And I'm pretty sure for most oily skin gals like me. I used too much the first time (normal moisturizer amt) and had to spread it all the way to my neck, chest! It spreads like a thick lotion, that takes time to seep into your skin. You'll probably need to work it in for a few seconds. Then it immediately made me sweat -_- upper lip, forehead, under lips, basically everywhere I applied it on my face.So the take away is. Don't be foolish like me and buy it for Oily skin \ud83d\ude02 I'll probably use it on my body !If you have oily skin and really want to try it out, use it in winters, not in Humid weather, like I did!Or this will be a beautiful moisturizer for Dry skin!!Hope this helps.",
