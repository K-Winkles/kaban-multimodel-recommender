I had been living in Florida for a year at this point. I'm 38 and always had oiley skin but maybe the sun dried it out bc never have I had such terrible skin!I was using ponds for dry skin at night and day and bought a electric face scrubber, used wash that exfoliates and still flakes, flakes flakes.I read some reviews and said \"eff it let me try. What's the worst that can happen\"?Well. Night 1 after cleaned face and shower. I didn't see flakes. Nice. Cool. Go to bed only to wake up with... holy crap! No flakes!Day two. Wash face. Put on. Usually by the time I get to work I'm shedding skin flakes around nose, lip edges or eye brows.None. Mid day I checked .. no flakes .. what is life? This is the secret sauce of moist skin ladies and gents!By the time I got home .. no flakes. My heart is so light and feathery\ud83e\udd29I have been using for several days.No \ud83d\udc4fmore\ud83d\udc4fflakes\ud83d\udc4fI am so happy and HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!My only regret is not finding this sooner.Your face doesn't feel oiley. A nice clean light scent. And best part is my face no longer itches and flakes. I would give 100 \ud83c\udf1f if I could.Thank you from the bottom of my heart Garnier \u2764\ufe0f**adding that I forgot to put on yesterday morning and still.. perfect skin. I ranted and raved to my bf about this product and he said I already said that.. so I have to share with y'all! I also have $70 in my cart of Garnier skincare I am buying on payday.

                "reviewText": "I've used a ton of moisturizers. I've used affordable store brands to brands that cost over $125 for a tiny tube or jar.Finding a good moisturizer is hard. This one is by far the best I've used and I hope will always be available for purchase. It's a winner!Gel is easily absorbed. No greasy feeling at all. Face is still soft the next day. It takes very little to do the job, so the product will last a long time. The smell is pleasant and not over powering. The jar is easy to open (important if you have arthritis, like I do even at 39).It's easy to use and so pleasant, while doing exactly what it says it does.I'd highly recommend this.For comparison, I have normal to dry skin. I can use it once a day or once every two days and have fantastic results. Someone with drier skin could easily obtain similar results by using the recommended twice a day.",

                "reviewText": "I have been stuck in what seems like an endless cycle of rotating moisturizers in hopes of finding the one. I have very picky skin and tend to get breakouts from so many different ingredients. I also live in the Midwest with very cold dry winters. This one is definitely not the one, but it is nice for once in a while.The good- absorbs quickly and feels cooling on the skin. Offers moisture, but isn\u2019t overwhelming. As long as I use sparingly, I don\u2019t get breakouts. Wonderful for soothing after eyebrow plucking or exfoliating.The not so good- Not a heavy hitter for moisture. I find this nice in the summer/fall when it isn\u2019t super dry outside. Doesn\u2019t hold its own in winter time. My skin is left craving more moisture about two hours after application. This could be a great option for people who do not have dry skin and just need a little skin refresh. Also great for people who live in warmer climates.Tip- Keep chilled in fridge for an extra dose of calming for the skin. The gel base really helps to absorb the chill and it feels wonderful.",

I've not used a different moisturizer in almost a decade and always come back to this one. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor and try it. Super lightweight thanks to it being a water creme, smells really pretty, and is nice and cooling on the skin when you use it. You won't regret giving it a shot! :)",
