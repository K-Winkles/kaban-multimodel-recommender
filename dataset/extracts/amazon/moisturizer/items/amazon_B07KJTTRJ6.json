                "reviewText": "I've been using this for the past six months and it's easily become my favorite moisturizer. It smells great and the gel consistency is just right, not watery or really thick. It's light, but a little bit sticky. My favorite thing is it doesn't sit on top of your skin and smear off like I've had other moisturizers do. Like If you run your finger down the side of your face you get a weird residue, like you would with sunblock. None of that here! I don't wear a full face of makeup, but as someone who has to create my own eyebrows daily the pens and pencils don't weakly smear on top like they do with the other moisturizers that coat your face. The lines turn out very smooth and opaque.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new moisturizer, and was tired of the elf one I had. So I was looking on Amazon and came across this one. One the price caught my attention and so did the packaging. I was a little hesitant though when I got it because it says gel moisturizer...my skin doesn't usually like the gel moisturizer. So I was like just try it and if I don't like..return. so I put it on my face and wow it feel so soft and smells like a citrus fruit tree..love it. It is not sticky at all, it's literally a lotion with a texture of gel and it absorbs fast in my skin. I have used it for about a week now...and it's going to be a staple in my beauty care.",

The pores around my nose, cheeks and chin were clogged overnight.So far, though, I would definitely still recommend this as an under eye serum! I will be cautiously continuing to use it for this. It works much better on drier skin.",
