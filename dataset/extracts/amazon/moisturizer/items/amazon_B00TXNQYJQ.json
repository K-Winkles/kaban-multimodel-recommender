                "reviewText": "I ran across this little gem of a book when I was looking for recipes to make my own beauty products with healthier ingredients. It definitely has those and so much more! The 50 recipes included in the book are worth its purchase alone and that's just part of the book. I appreciated the simple explanations that made it easier to understand why regular beauty products are most often very unhealthy for the body with the chemicals they contain. In my opinion the front cover of the book is an accurate indicator of the information within. The beautiful picture and colors that indicate practicality, health, and efficiency which are delivered through the pages of the book. Even without the recipes, I probably would have purchased it anyways once I read the table of content of all it contains. Having the details provided on hand any time I need to refer to them makes this a very wise purchase - at least for me and probably for anyone else concerned about their beauty products and how they might be detrimental to overall good health. I can't wait to try out some of just the regular tips and suggestions given for my skin type and will be picking up the ingredients I need in order to make my own products from these recipes. Such fun and useful information I will enjoy using for years, and I definitely recommend this book if are looking for healthier beauty products and tips for creating your ideal complexion according to your skin type.",

There are also beauty secrets to keep your skin young and looking the best it can be without all the chemicals and expensive beauty creams. This can save you money in the long run and it can also help you by using all natural ingredients. I used some of the products on my skin and they felt great on my skin and they also made me appear more youthful. There are several more tips that I want to try and I am looking at other products that I may be able to use that are organic. You can have glowing and beautiful skin and not spend a lot of money and this book taught me how to do this without a lot of hassle. I would recommend this book to anyone who cares what goes on their skin and also has concerns about the environment.",

I have made many natural skin care products and was hoping to get some inspiration from this book, but that did not end up being the case.",

The recipes are so easy and I found I had many of the items in my pantry. I was especially excited to try the pumpkin sugar scrub. It worked great on my dry skin.The book is an easy read with a good deal of useful info including, but not limited to, the simple and easy to prepare masks, scrubs, toners, and lotions.",
