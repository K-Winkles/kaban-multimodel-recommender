                "reviewText": "Firstly, A little about me: i have very finicky skin and deal with rosacea and some breakouts. finding a moisturizer that is lightweight and nourishing is surprisingly hard. gel creams tend to do little, and creams feel stuffy and break me out.This is a perfect in-between. It does have that water cream feel to it, but it spreads well and has some oomph to it. i appreciate the very slight cooling sensation as well. no irritation, dryness, or additional redness here either. If you\u2019re very dry, this probably wouldn\u2019t be enough during fall or winter but other than that i could see this working well for most people. It\u2019s a pretty big tube (2.5oz) for $25, so i\u2019d say it\u2019s similar in value to a $15 moisturizer that has 1.7oz. I\u2019ve had it for about 1 1/2 months and barely made a dent in it. definitely worth it, i\u2019d say. I\u2019m interested enough to try the toner at some point too.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this since my favorite moisturizer hydro boost water gel is $20 for only 1.7 fl oz. This one is around the same price for 2.5 fl oz, which is a better deal to me. It feels slightly heavier and creamier than the hydro boost, but it is still nice. It doesn\u2019t really have a scent at all. I have oily/normal combo skin and it does well. I also have acne prone skin, and I haven\u2019t noticed this worsening at all. I feel that is hydrates well. I still love the texture and \u201cwater\u201d feel of the hydro boost the best. But this is probably the second best moisturizer I\u2019ve tried. it is not sticky at all and dries down nice and soft. If you need something slight heavier than hydro boost but not by much more, this is a good product for this. For reference I am very picky about texture of moisturizers and HATE heavy creamy textures that feel like lotion. This barely has a \u201clotion\u201d feel to it. I don\u2019t think it would be great for drier skin, but maybe for combo oily/dry.",

                "reviewText": "Cost: I gave this product 4-stars because you pay $25 for a very tiny bottle (2.5 fl oz.). Tube feels full to the max which is nice, but I\u2019d prefer an option to buy a much bigger tube as this would go fast if using AM and PM. I only use AM, but this still isn\u2019t a tube that\u2019s going to last very long for a dry skin gal.Other than the price, I love the product. This is a very clean product and very friendly for us acne prone (I have hormonal acne as well), dry skin, sensitive, red faced prone gals! I have tried soooo many lotions, creams, and gels, and I really feel hydrated and like the way my skin looks with this product. Currently I\u2019m just using the lotion and haven\u2019t started using the face wash yet, but am excited to see results with both products together since both hydrate the skin.Even with the price tag, I will continue to use because I feel clean, safe, and happy with the product. My skin is showing the benefits of the product for sure.",

                "reviewText": "I have subtype 2 rosacea (diagnosed by an NHS dermatologist) and have struggled to find a moisturiser that is hydrating enough to soothe redness whilst at the same time being oil free and non-comedogenic. This product satisfies these criteria and is something of a miracle cream. All of my symptoms: redness, dryness, and blemishes have reduced since I started using this product.The consistency is somewhere between a serum and lotion. A small blob is enough for my whole face and neck. It takes about ten minutes to fully absorb after application and leaves no visible trace. After about an hour the reduction in redness is clear. Skin feels soft and natural all day.The ingredients are: Aqua, dicaprylyl ether, propanediol, caprylic/capric triglyceride, butylene glycol, squalane, phenoxyethanol, sodium polyacrylate, benzyl alcohol, dicaprylyl carbonate, carbomer, sodium hydroxide, xanthan gum, disodium EDTA, sodium lauroyl lactylate, sodium polyglutamate, polyglyceryl-3 caprate, sorbitan trioleate, ceramide np, ceramide ap, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, ethylhexylglycerin, myristoyl tripeptide-31, tocopherol, ceramide eop.I would recommend this product alongside Cetaphil's gentle cleanser, twice per day. I have also gotten good results from Dermatica's azelaic acid cream. Hope this review is helpful for other rosacea sufferers.",
