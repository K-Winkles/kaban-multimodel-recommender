Notably, it revitalizes the skin, imparting both a look and feel of being more awake and alive \u2013 a unique experience compared to other moisturizers I've used. In addition to this moisturizer, I've also tried the face wash, eye cream, and acne spot treatment from the same line. Each product has proven its value, justifying the price with their effectiveness.",

I have normal-dry skin (drier during pregnancy), and this is moisturizing while still light! I will say though, it doesn\u2019t keep the skin hydrated for a long time so this is more to be worn for UNDER makeup or spf than as a stand-alone.",

It does not pill, feels wonderful on the skin, absorbs well, and doesn't break me out. I've noticed my skin is more even and it's reduced some of my forehead lines. It has a lot of good ingredients. the only downfall is the cost. I wish I could buy a large bottle for cheaper haha",
