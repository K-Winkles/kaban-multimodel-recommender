I wear it under my make-up and it even helps with the smoothness of the application when using my foundation. I recommend this product!",

                "reviewText": "My dermatologist started me on an overnight cream that requires me to use sunscreen during the day time. I bought this in hopes of doing away with my day time moisturizer. Well let me tell you what this product works well as a moisturizer and if you wanted to moisturize then use this product you could, but this product stands on its own. If I had one complaint it would be the level of SPF per product I honestly wish it was higher.In order to off set the 30 SPF I started using a slightly higher SPF mineral tinted sunscreen (once my Vichy sunscreen has had time to set) in place of my foundation, and I also thinking of using a mineral setting spray that has SPF in it for when I do want to go full coverage makeup, or if I plan on prolonged sun exposure I will use a higher SPF on top of Vichy instead of just tinted SPFSo far my plan seems to be working and my skins looking as young as ever! Glowing without any real make-up on!",

It's a rich yet somehow lightweight cream. It's actually quite a small bottle for the price, which is both good and bad. Good because it's small enough to be a part of your carry-on luggage, but bad because you won't want to waste a single pump. It's super stuff, though. Really like it.",
