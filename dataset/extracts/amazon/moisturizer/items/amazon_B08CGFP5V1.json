I have tried several moisturizers available on Amazon but never found like with great price. This moisturizer has truly been a game-changer for my skin, and I cannot recommend it enough. The texture of this moisturizer is incredibly lightweight and non-greasy except smell. Unlike other moisturizers I've tried in the past, this moisturizer absorbs quickly, leaving no residue or sticky feeling behind. As this moisturizer is packed with nourishing and natural components such as hyaluronic acid and aloe vera, this moisturizer not only hydrates but also helps to improve the overall health and appearance of your skin.",

But a couple years ago I wanted to try something to potentially brighten up my appearance as I felt like I was always looking tired. Obviously this stuff isn\u2019t going to work miracles but I do notice I look and feel better when I use this. I also can\u2019t believe how soft my face feels after using this. I\u2019ve never spent much time thinking about my face softness before, but once I started using this I was like \u201cwow.\u201d The biggest way that this helps my appearance though is that I regularly get white, flakey, dead skin on my nose and for years and years I have tried to either scrub it off with a washcloth and water, I\u2019ve tried using tweezers to pick the skin off, but none of that actually worked. It just came back instantly. But now when I get that, I just put a drop of this on my finger and rub it on my nose and the dead skin is gone for at least the rest of the day. If your a dude just looking to start some basic skincare I say this product is a great place to start.",

                "reviewText": "This lotion has a wonderful masculine smell and feels refreshing on your skin. However, it's very thin (i.e runny) and leaves your face looking greasy and shiny after application. Also, the brand and high price would make you think this was made in a Nordic/Northern European country with very high quality ingredients. However, if you look at the fine print you'll see that it's made in China. So, once again you're paying top dollar for questionable quality. My recommendation would be to spend a couple more dollars and buy something from Highlands Naturals like their Anti-Aging Face Cream for men. It's a thick cream, made of high quality natural ingredients and made in Clearwater, Florida, USA. Don't waste your money on this cheap Chinese garbage.",
