                "reviewText": "The LANEIGE Water Sleeping Mask is a popular and well-loved Korean skincare product known for its hydrating and skin-refreshing properties. It's designed to be used as an overnight mask to provide intense hydration and improve the overall condition of your skin while you sleep. Here's a review of the LANEIGE Water Sleeping Mask:1. Intense Hydration: One of the standout features of this mask is its ability to deliver deep hydration. The gel-like texture is packed with moisture, and it effectively replenishes your skin's moisture levels, leaving my skin plump and dewy by the morning.2. Lightweight and Non-Greasy: I appreciate that the Water Sleeping Mask has a lightweight, non-greasy formula. It doesn't feel heavy on the skin and absorbs relatively quickly, making it comfortable to wear while you sleep.3. Cooling Sensation: I absolutely enjoy the cooling sensation upon application, which can be especially refreshing during hot weather or if you have irritated skin.4. Brightening Effect: With regular use, I have noticed that their skin appears brighter and more radiant. The mask contains various skin-brightening ingredients, such as Hunza apricot extract and evening primrose root extract.5. Versatility: While it's marketed as an overnight mask, some people use it as a quick pick-me-up during the day or as a regular moisturizer for extra hydration.6. Pleasant Fragrance: I also enjoy the subtle, pleasant fragrance of the product, though it's worth noting that fragrance can be a potential irritant for some individuals with sensitive skin.7. Packaging: The product comes in a sleek, blue jar with a spatula for hygienic application.8. Suitable for Most Skin Types: The LANEIGE Water Sleeping Mask is generally suitable for most skin types, including dry, normal, combination, and even oily skin. However, as with any skincare product, it's advisable to perform a patch test if you have sensitive or reactive skin.Overall, the LANEIGE Water Sleeping Mask is known to provide deep hydration, improve skin texture, and give users a refreshed and radiant complexion. It's a versatile product that can be a great addition to your skincare routine, particularly if you're looking to boost your skin's moisture levels and wake up with a revitalized look.",

My face was really dry and irritated from dermaplaning and a typical dry winter weather. This product absorbed quickly. It did somewhat soothe my irritated skin when applied soon after treatment. But didn\u2019t deliver the deep hydration I was needing. No glow here.It\u2019s possible my skin is just too dry after applying retin-A regularly for acne and dermaplaning. ( I didn\u2019t apply retin-A before applying this). I thought my skin would have felt softer and have a hydrated glow after a few nights. No noticeable feel or look of my skin.Decent product, no smell, no irritation. I gave it 4 stars as it may work perfect for someone without a severely dry skin type.",

It's also veerrry important to keep your skin moisturized overnight while you're sleeping and this does an amazing job doing that. 100% recommend this!",
