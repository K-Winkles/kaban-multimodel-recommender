        "description": "Ex-crime reporter Raymond St. Ives has elegant taste, a yen for gambling and an unfinished novel in his typewriter. When he crosses paths with sinister Abner Procane, he gets something else: a price on his head. St. Ives is a hard-boiled update of classic mystery thrillers, particularly The Maltese Falcon. Charles Bronson is smoothly right as the clever title character, at odds with petty crooks and high rollers -- among them, Maximilian Schell as a whining lackey and Jacqueline Bisset as a modern femme fatale. But the show is stolen by John Houseman as the devilish Procane, a worthy successor to Sydney Greenstreet. Elisha Cook, Daniel J. Travanti, Jeff Goldblum and Robert Englund are also featured in this sleek, funny caper.",

                "reviewText": "I first saw this film in a theatre in Summer, 1976, and have since watched it on TV several times, awaiting the day the DVD would be issued.It is easily said that this is not only one of my favorite Bronson films, but just one of my favorite films in general. There is an ambience or quality to this film that just reaches out to me. Everything just works.The other reviews listed here sum up the movie pretty well. But I will say I am surprised that only one reviewer mentions in passing one role that helps make this movie, and that is the one played by Dana Elcar. Elcar plays a detective on the police force who is not only friendly to St. Ives, but somewhat protective by the latitude he offers. At the ending, it is of course natural that Dana Elcar's character is called in by St. Ives to help tidy up the messy details. Dana Elcar was a supreme actor both in the movies and on TV, and it is true tragedy that he ended life going blind.If you enjoy Bronson movies, or laid back, cool detective movies this one is for you. Now, if I can just locate that great looking cafeteria in this movie I will be all set. Ray St. Ives sure knew where to eat, but never learned not to bet on the Los Angeles Rams!Semper Fi.",

Charles Bronson fans will be the most likely audience of otherwise ordinary thriller, though beautiful Bisset nearly steals the picture.",
