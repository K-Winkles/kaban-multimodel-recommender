                "reviewText": "I decided to try this product after seeing some influencer reviews and reading about the ingredients. I have sensitive skin and I was looking for a night cream that would hydrate, calm, and soothe my skin without causing any irritation or breakouts. I also bought the moisturizing cream from the same brand, I used it interchangeably with this moisturizer for different purposes. This product is amazing. It feels moisturizing and lightweight on my skin, and it leaves it feeling dewy, soft, and smooth. It has improved my skin texture and appearance, and it has helped with my skin barrier and moisture levels. It also calms my skin after using other products that might be irritating, such as scrubs or acids. It does not have any fragrance added but it does have a nice clean fresh smell to it which I appreciate, and it does not clog my pores or cause any skin reactions. In fact, it seems to improve any acne or breakout reactions from harsher skin products and negates the effects they may have had without using it. I use it during the day sometimes, and it does not make my skin oily or shiny. It is easy to spread and you do not need a lot of product to cover your face and neck. I even had an issue spot on my leg that the cream was too thick for and every other product seemed to irritate more and this was very helpful in clearing things up. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin and needs a night moisturizing cream that will hydrate, calm, and soothe their skin. It is worth every penny and I would buy from this brand again. This is the best creams I have ever used for my skin. It is a 5/5 product for me. Will definitely buy again. CeraVe wins with this for me.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion for quite some time now, and I can confidently say it has become an essential part of my daily skincare routine. As someone with dry and sensitive skin, finding the right moisturizer has always been a challenge, but CeraVe has truly exceeded my expectations.One of the standout features of this lotion is its lightweight consistency. Unlike some heavy creams that can feel greasy or cloying on the skin, CeraVe PM effortlessly glides on and absorbs quickly. This makes it perfect for daily use, especially as part of my evening skincare ritual.The moisturizing power of this lotion is truly remarkable. Despite its light texture, it provides deep hydration that keeps my skin feeling supple and nourished throughout the day and night. I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture of my skin since incorporating CeraVe PM into my routine. Dry patches are now a thing of the past, and my complexion looks and feels healthier (even during winter)!Not only does it cater to my dry skin needs, but it also doubles as an excellent makeup primer. Applying foundation is a breeze after using CeraVe PM, as it creates a smooth canvas that helps makeup adhere better and last longer. This dual functionality is a game-changer for someone like me who prefers a simplified beauty routine.In terms of packaging, the pump dispenser is not only convenient but also ensures that the product remains hygienic and free from contamination.Overall, CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion has become my go-to solution for dry skin. Its lightweight feel, intense hydration, and multitasking abilities make it a standout product in my skincare collection.",

Having recently ran out, I decided to try this one because of the recent hype about peptides for the skin.This light, opaque moisterizer absorbs quickly and completely. I use twice as much as recommended because my skin is so parched. Non-irritating and actually calming, it creates a light barrier on my face. I've used it for a few days and nights now and for the price, I'm actually impressed.This will serve as my in-between-paychecks moisterizer until I can buy the highly-moisterizing one I normally use. I will be using this underneath my normal moisturizer for that excellent barrier.",
