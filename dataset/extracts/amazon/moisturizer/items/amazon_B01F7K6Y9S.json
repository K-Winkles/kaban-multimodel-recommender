I have been using the Eva naturals products for a couple of months and I am sticking with them in my beauty routine because the products really work. I am nearing 60 and I truly see a difference in my wrinkles. My skin is smoother, plumper and my wrinkles, well, they are still there, but overall, look a bit smoother. There is no miracle cream for making them go away! I also love the texture. It is not sticky and doesn\u2019t leave a film after application. My skin really absorbs the cream very well. I like the dispenser. The pump is easy to handle. I have early onset arthritic hands and I can\u2019t put too much pressure on pumps. The dispenser is large and easy to work with.",

                "reviewText": "This is an early review but this has been my experience so far. I\u2019m 36 with some wrinkles under my eyes ( crows feet)I\u2019ve been using this for just 10 days so I have not seen any major improvements in wrinkles just yet. But i will say it does moisturize very well without feeling heavy. It\u2019s nice and light. I use it on my entire face, under eyes, eye lids, my neck and chest. It\u2019s a bout a pump and half to two pumps per application.Keep in mind that scientifically It takes about 6-8 weeks to see results with any products.I would like to mention that I do have very sensitive skin. I\u2019ve had no bad reactions with this. It doesn\u2019t even burn my eyes like some creams and serums. It makes my skin very soft and it absorbs pretty quickly. But I usually wait about 10 minutes before applying my foundation. I use this in the mornings and at night before bed, right after washing my face or showering. Products work better when your pores are open by the way.This doesn\u2019t have much of a scent either which is great.I\u2019ll continue to use this until it\u2019s gone, then decide if I\u2019ll continue to purchase more. You can\u2019t beat the price of $11 then it has a $2 off coupon. To me it\u2019s worth trying. I\u2019ve spent $60-$100 on wrinkle creams before and there was no difference. Just less money in my pocket....",

                "reviewText": "As far as aloe products goes, this is one of the smellier ones. I usually try products out for a month to see how it would affect my skin, usually my face, and go from there. I used this after I ran out of another product called Aloe Infusion Body and Face Moisturizer.From what I experienced it's not bad. It goes on well and doesn't leave a slimy or greasy residue though that aloe smell lingers until it's truly dry or absorbed through the skin I suppose? I wouldn't say it's malodorous exactly but I've smelled worse and it's not like it's gag inducing. I also look for products that are as natural as possible and doesn't have so many ingredients and this one is pretty nice.Unfortunately it's given me a few pimples here and there while the one that I replaced with this did not so I'm gonna go back to using that one. Just sad that it's so darn expensive. I'd make my own, and I have, but I get lazy and/or preoccupied. Sue me.",

It looked like it belonged to an old, old woman. I was appalled. I searched out the creams with the ingredient I had gleaned from the internet to see what I needed. I use another product in the am, they seem to work great together! And the price is awesome. I definitely recommend this product. It does not promote acne, so my skin stays nice and supple without any breakouts.",
