No, it hasn\u2019t, but it has given me an extra boost of moisture and has helped even the appearance of my dry skin. This doesn\u2019t have any heavy perfumes or smells at all which is really good. I can\u2019t stand fragranced lotions. This hardly has any smell at all which is great. It is thick and not greasy at all. I originally purchased this to apply to my chest and neck, but it feels so great I decided to use it on my face as well. It\u2019s not to thick and I can wear it before bed or under my makeup. I am very pleased with the product and I look forward to the long term benefits because the short term have been great already.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this for a couple months pretty consistently now. I still really enjoy it. I was using another cream off and on, but have abandoned that one for this. I have dryer cheeks and an oily tzone. It works well for both areas. I feel comfortable putting it on my under eyes since it's a very light formula but hydrating. I LOVE the pump. I press it and get a perfect amount of cream for my face and neck. Had my mom who is turning 60 this year try it and she said she preferred it to what she was using. Some people mentioned a smell, I don't really think it has a strong one, or at least I've never commented on it.Edit: They changed the packaging and doubled the price.... Yuck.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve only been using this product for one week, but I have been applying it daily and so far I like the results. My skin has been looking nice, moisturized and even-toned. I have not broken out at all, either, which is always a concern for me as I have sensitive skin. Update: I have been using this for weeks/months now and still love it. As a matter fact, I went on a short vacation and did not bring it with me and noticed a vast difference in my skin - I couldn\u2019t wait to get back to it.",
