It is rare for me to find a sunscreen that I'm not allergic to, that also has a decent SPF. This one by SuperGoop is great. It definitely leaves a shine on your skin, so I would wear this under loose powder. I'll buy this again.",

                "reviewText": "I love this moisturizer! I use it every day and under makeup. It give you a slight glow and definitely gives you a feel of instant relief from dryness. No white look or lingering sun screen smell. A bit pricy but worth it as a little goes a long way. Also FSA approved. One of the better supergoop products. Recommend!",

                "reviewText": "It's ok I guess but I'm not using it again, it will just live in my bathroom cabinet now. Firstly, the smell is very unpleasant. The feel isn't that nice and it remains a bit tacky for the rest of the day. As for a second application, get ready to wash it all off to reapply as adding more on will feel heavy and slippy. I tried it with mascara and after 2 hours, I looked quite panda like.Finally, this I should have done a bit more research on before and that's on me, but there are currently queries over the safety of Avobenzone and Homosalate. Obviously, thats up to you, but personally, I've found better products that have better ingredients and feel better for me.I can't remember if the ingredients are on here, but ta-da:Active Ingredients: Avobenzone 2.5%, Homosalate 8%, Octisalate 5%Inactive Ingredients: Water, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Oleosomes, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyester-7, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seedcake Extract, Aphanizomenon Flos-Aquae Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Xanthan Gum, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Cerium Oxide, Platinum Powder, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenethyl Alcohol, Chlorphenesin",
