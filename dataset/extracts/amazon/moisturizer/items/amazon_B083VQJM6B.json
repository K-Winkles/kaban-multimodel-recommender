What I mainly wanted was the moisturizer with sunscreen. So far I'm loving this. First of all, the packaging is very nice in the glass bottle, and when it gets low the cap twists off easily. The pump dispenses just the right amount at a time. The cream itself is so rich and silky smooth, it spreads easily and absorbs beautifully without feeling greasy. The scent is also very nice, nothing heavy or overpowering. My face feels amazing, soft and super moisturized, and God knows I need that! Very pleased with my purchase, I plan to incorporate this into my morning routine and will continue to purchase. Their customer service is also amazing should you have any questions, very helpful and quick to respond.",

                "reviewText": "I love this moisturizer! I have some soft wrinkles, but I detest heavy day creams or greasy face look. This is just right! It\u2019s light and has a creamy texture, has a delicate almost no scent smell which dissipates and dries quickly, leaves no white cast, feels dewy but satiny, never glossy. Cream foundation or powder foundation goes on smoothly. Skin looks beautiful all day! And I never get a blemish or clogged pores with this cream. My only complain is that though I love the pump mechanism, when it runs low it\u2019s difficult to get whatever bit is left behind. For the price, it hurts to throw the pump out knowing that I may have two more days worth of cream left\ud83d\ude23 Should come in a squeezable tube. Until then, I need to keep repurchasing, I\u2019m hooked!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve ordered this a number of times and have generally been pleased. It goes on light and moisturizes great. I also appreciated the fact that it had a light pleasant fragrance. A few months back I got a bottle of it that smelled really off. It had a heavy petroleum smell to it that was unpleasant to put on. I thought maybe it was a one off and so I continued buying. Fast forward to now and I have just started using a new bottle. It has the same off putting odor to it (lot D12T4, exp 04/24). It stinks to the point I can\u2019t continue using it. Reading other reviews, it seems I\u2019m not the only purchaser that\u2019s had this problem. I\u2019ll be looking for another product that can be more consistent with the quality of what they send. This is a shame because I really enjoy this product, but I don\u2019t want to spend money only to get the occasional surprise stink bomb.",

                "reviewText": "I started using anti-aging face products about 20 years ago. Back then you bought products from a certain doctor that did infomercials. The lotions/creams contained some kind of \u201cspecial sauce\u201d with magical ingredients that could only be obtained by buying those products. They were expensive, but they worked and I figured you get what you pay for.Nowadays, it seems like every company has essentially the same ingredients; the same vitamins, peptides, retinol, etc. There is no longer any secret sauce. It\u2019s all just branding.One differentiator I became painfully aware of is cost. The products I had used for many years had become more expensive. They also were being sold in smaller containers! So less product for more money! It got to the point where I was paying $85 for a 0.5 ounce jar of Moisturizer with SPF! That was when I decided to find an alternative.I searched Amazon and found The Naeli Day Moisturizer. It had very good reviews at a very reasonable price. It\u2019s been several months now since I started using the product and I have to say it is great! My fine lines are gone and wrinkles are less noticeable! What\u2019s more, I live in Arizona and the SPF holds up well under the extremely sunny conditions we have here! I liked the product so much that I purchased the Naeli Night moisturizer, which I am also very happy with! They both have a nice texture; not heavy or too thick and have a pleasant smell. They go on smooth and absorb quickly into the skin. I\u2019ve had no skin irritation or breakouts.These are high-quality products that work as advertised! I\u2019m extremely pleased with my purchases and would highly recommend them!",

I liked the rosemary part, but the chemical smell was gross. I didn't return it because I did like it as a moisturizer/sunscreen. I could put my makeup over it without any issues. The smell does go away after an hour, so if you care bare a weird smell for a bit, I suppose its worth it.",
