                "reviewText": "I've been using this for a few weeks now all over my body after taking a shower (so about 2x/day) and it helped even out my skin tone, made my skin brighter and gave my skin a nice, healthy glow. A small pump goes a long way and it does take a bit of rubbing to fully absorb into the skin but it doesn't feel sticky or oily at all. I like the faint, clean smell it has and the fact that the smell doesn't linger. I don't notice the smell after about an hour of having it on. I like that I can even use it on my face and neck and it didn't break me out. I had a farmer's tan on my arms and it helped even out the skin color. It helped lighten some post acne marks on face and neck. My elbows and knees don't look so dark and ashy like before. I am definitely going to keep using this. I think the formula is great, so hopefully they don't change it. I definitely recommend this product, but if you are using it for the purposes I've mentioned, I suggest using a sunscreen and sun protective clothing when you go outside so you don't undo all the work you've done.",

I have been using for a couple months and have found this cream is not greasy and quickly absorbs into skin. The consistency is between a lotion and a cream. Has a very light scent that does not clash with any other scent I choose to wear. The container states hands, face, and body / I have not used on my face, but great for hands and body. I have not noticed any lightening of dark spots, but will give it time. This product comes in a tub with a pump, which sits great on my counter. Overall, for me, I think this is a good product at a great price - I use other products from this brand and have been happy with the quality and value.",

                "reviewText": "I am very pleased with this product.The skin on my arms was so thin, terribly dry, cracked, cut, bruised and sensitive. My arms actually hurt when I touched them. Anything I simply brushed against bruised and/or cut me. Just about anything would become a wound that would really bleed and require cleaning and bandaging. (My husband joked he should just wrap me in bubble-wrap.) He was so good to \u201cdoctor\u201d my wounds. We were getting worried, as it just was getting worse.I also had a problem with extremely dry skin in the inner corners of my eyes. I\u2019d tried several products, but they really didn\u2019t work, either. I had to be so careful using anything around my eyes, so as not to irritate them, causing salty tears, resulting in crusty eye corners. Going around in circles and getting nowhere.I\u2019d tried lots of advanced therapy lotions and creams for dry and sensitive skin. Most left my skin oily or greasy. None really absorbed into my skin. In desperation, we began searching online for something that would help. We decided to try Advanced Clinicals Retinol Body Lotion Moisturizer Face Lotion & Body Cream.It\u2019s been just wonderful. I experienced immediate results. It is NOT oily or greasy! The Cream absorbed into my skin, immediately began repairing, and plumped it up. My sensitivity is nothing like it was before I began using it.It has no fragrance. There is no irritation to my eyes, so I can use it everywhere my body was needing deep hydration and moisturizing (my face, around my eyes, my neck and arms.) It has restored my skin barrier for protection. I actually have smooth skin again.I\u2019ve been using it just 9 days and feel very comfortable recommending it to anyone who is looking for something like this. It lives up to its advertisement.A little bit goes a long way. Apply it sparingly. Not necessary to lavish it on.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using Advanced Clinicals Hyaluronic Acid Body Lotion for years and wondered if they had any other lotions in their line because of how well that works for hydrating my skin but i am getting older now (54) and need a little extra something to keep my skin tight and wrinkle free. I saw this and decided to give it a try. I am amazed at how short of at time i have been using it before i noticed a difference in my skin.Less than a week and the skin on my thighs appears tighter, more hydrated and the skin above my knees has the best results because i had lost a bunch of weight do to an illness and the skin started to sag and i noticed some semi-circle type wrinkles/lines that i find unattractive, especially in the summer. They are nearly unnoticeable and the skin is evenly hydrated. This has been an issue for me for over a year, and am so happy i found something that actually works, not promises to and doesn't we have all been there, you spend tons of money on something and get let down over and over again.We ladies just want a company that will help us beautify our skin without breaking the bank and being let down. and I HAVE!!I also am trying this on my neck and chest area, to get rid of and prevent any further \"side sleeper\" lines.I am in love with Advanced Clinicals.Since their body lotions work so well, i decided to start using their gel face masks. I bought the Collagen Anti Aging Gel Mask W/Coconut Oil & Rosewater + Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Gel Mask W/Soothing Chamomile 2-Pack Skin Care Set. Hydrating Facial Skincare Mask Bundle.The very first time i used it, i was very surprised and the results. My face was so soft and my skin had the glow i have never had before. Most products like these from designed brands are so pricey and you never know if they really work. I am sticking with Advanced Clinicals for many years to come. I highly recommend all of their products, i promise you will not be disappointed.I know my review seems over the top for this company but that is how much i like it & want others to know",
