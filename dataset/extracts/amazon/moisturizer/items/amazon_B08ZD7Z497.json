I have noticed that my skin feels more balanced and healthy since using this product. I have recommended this product to teens I know and it has done them wonders.The texture of the moisturizer is lightweight and non-greasy, which is perfect for my combination skin. It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any residue. I also found that it applied smoothly and evenly, making it easy to incorporate into my skincare routine.In terms of results, I have noticed a positive difference in my skin's overall appearance. The moisturizer has helped to hydrate and smooth my skin, leaving it looking more supple and radiant. Additionally, I have seen a reduction in redness and blemishes since using this product, which is a huge plus at 37.One of the standout features of this moisturizer is its natural and clean formula. It is free from harsh chemicals and synthetic fragrances, which is a huge plus for me as I prefer to use products that are gentle on my skin.Overall, I would highly recommend the Hero Cosmetics Clarifying Prebiotic Moisturizer. It is a great option for those with combination or oily skin who are looking for a lightweight and effective moisturizer that also supports the skin's natural balance.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this moisturizer after using the patches & jelly cleanser and loving how they helped my skin I was hoping to use this as my new \u201cskincare Routine\u201d moisturizer. I am 32yo and have recently been dealing with very stubborn cystic acne the cleanser paired with my acne cream was working wonders but leaving my face very dry. So when I saw this moisturizer I thought it would work very well as a new addition. I know it takes time for a product to work right and get used to your skin so I\u2019ve waited to give this review.. and while it is extremely moisturizing ( it felt like I had literally rubbed water on my face ) it was also EXTREMELY oily which I DEFINITELY did not need while trying to clear my face. After about a month of trying it out I finally realized it was not my skin getting used to the product, it was just not going to work for me. My 12yo daughter absolutely loves it though! And it does keep her skin looking beautiful and moisturized. I just do not recommend if you already are experiencing oily skin because it will clog pores and make your face feel like your just rubbing oil all over it.",

                "reviewText": "I have been struggling to find a moisturizer. I love the green sunscreen so I had high hopes for this. I love the texture and how runny it is but overall I don't love it. With this winter weather, furnace heat is sucking me dry. It's not a bad moisturizer and it doesn't break me out at all, it's just for the price, it doesn't do enough for me.Now I do like the packaging, it's pretty see through so you can see how much is left which I like. The only thing though is I go through this so quick, a little does not go a long way. I've almost went through half a tube and I've not had it that long... I will say, it doesn't work for me on the face, but it is nice on the body. I used it on my legs and it's not greasy at all. I wish I liked it on my face more because if I did this would be an absolute repurchase. It doesn\u2019t irritate my sensitive skin, is not greasy at all, and is completely unscented. Other than not being moisturizing enough, it's nice. Unfortunately I can't justify it.",

I appreciate that it uses really clean products, as that is something I keep an eye for in my skincare. It does a great job moisturizing and doesn\u2019t leave you feeling oily. It soaks up super quick and makes your skin look like its glowing. I use it in the morning and evening. Would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried at least 20 different moisturizers prior to this one, and none of them lived up to my expectations. They were either too oily, too expensive, not moisturizing enough, or they made me break out. I have very sensitive acne prone skin, so even the kinds made for acne prone faces would be too drying or even have the opposite effect. Enter this product: HALLELUJAH! I have been using it along with the rest of the set for over a year and my skin has never been happier. Even if I do get a breakout, this never irritates it or inflames it, and it keeps it from getting dry or agitated during the healing process. I use the face wash, toner, then this moisturizer every day, and also the healing balm as needed. I hope this product is NEVER discontinued, because I don\u2019t know how I could live without it! Thank you, Clear Collective \ud83d\ude4f",

This is incredible. No burning, no redness, and it really has helped balance out my skin. I was sick a few months ago and raw and broken out because the only thing i had was vaseline and body aveno. As soon as i started using this and some bha and niacinimide serums I immediately cleared up within days. This is a real life saver. It is not supposed to be super heavy because of the balancing properties it has. I do use it at night but it is definitely better for day. 100% recommend this product for sensitive skin. No fragrance AT ALL either.",
