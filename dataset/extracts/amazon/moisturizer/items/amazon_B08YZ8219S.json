                "reviewText": "This moisturizer is very appropriately named- it truly does feel light as cloud. I\u2019ve always had very oily skin that gets easily greasy and shiny with most moisturizers, so I\u2019m veryyy selective about what I use after a lot of bad experiences. I also break out really easily and anything that feels heavy on my skin is a definite \u201cno\u201d for me. The super lightweight, quickly absorbing texture of cloud whip is perfect for my skin and leaves it feeling more matte than usual, yet still very hydrated (which is very important to me since I\u2019m 32 and trying to slow down the aging process as much as possible \ud83e\udd72). It has the most lovely citrusy- fresh scent that is so nice to wake up to in the morning and makes me feel really fresh and clean. I find that my makeup sits really nicely on top of this product as well, which is a huge plus because I find that usually, despite having mostly very oily skin, my makeup tends to somehow find my only tiny dry patches and cling to them horribly, giving me unwanted texture. With this, I don\u2019t have that at all. So overall, nothing but rave reviews from me and I\u2019ll absolutely be using this as my daily morning moisturizer for the foreseeable future. In love.",

I've been using it daily during these past holidays while visiting my family in Arizona where my skin usually gets dry. This time around my face feels so much softer, smoother, and hydrated. The cream was light and had a gentle citrus scent. It also evened out my skin tone. Best of all, I know that their ingredients are natural and clean. I look forward to trying other products they have.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Cozy In A Jar For Your Face",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Short version: well-hydrating, smoothing, soft texture. Leaves skin velvety soft. Absorbs well into skin, not heavy at all. Nice barrier from free radicals and outside elements. Seems to brighten skin. Pleasant scent. Generous size. Hydration lasts at least 24+ hours.Long version: I really do love this Cloud Whip Face Cream! First off, the jar is full, they don\u2019t skimp on the actual amount of product in the jar.It starts as a creamy moisturizer, that seems to \u201cmelt\u201d ever so slightly on contact with warm skin. I feel that aids in a smooth, even application. It\u2019s just rich enough to make drier skin types feel adequately hydrated, but is not heavy at all. Melts right into the skin immediately. Doesn't sit on top of the skin, but it is not so thin that dry thirsty skin sucks it up too quickly. Emollient texture is lovely, feels like the name- if clouds were creamy and could be \"whipped\". In all my years, I can't recall seeing such a creamy yet fluffy, cloud-like face cream.Provides soft skin and hydration that lasts at least 24 hours. I live in a very very dry climate and have normal to dry (in the winter) skin that is definitely aging. And this cream is perfection! I have tried the brand's Daydreamer Moisturizer (which I do like but...) and this moisturizer is noticeably richer and creamier. Think whole milk versus whipping cream (regular not heavy).I feel like this moisturizer is a nice finish to my day routine because it feels like it seals in all of the other products I use so they can all work like they are supposed to- while leaving my skin well-hydrated in appearance and texture.I do feel my skin is brighter looking! I also have a couple of hyper-pigmentation spots (mild to dark) that seem to be lightening, slowly. My pores seem to look a little smaller too. And knowing that the entire product line is as close to naturally-based ingredients as possible is a huge plus! Especially for a moisturizer that will be sitting on and soaking in to the skin all day. Quick tip: Natural hydration that absorbs well also helps with smooth makeup application!The not-so-perfect things: I've always been taught that fragrance in skincare products should be a no-no. So I would like to know the source of the fragrance- if it is natural, like essential oils, etc.Finally, I would LOVE if this product had SPF in it. Considering it is formulated to aid in lightening dark spots and brighten the skin, it would be helpful to block the harmful light (from the sun mostly) a bit to aid in seeing the results better/faster. I think the company recently came out with a separate and specific SPF product. But I am in love with short routines and multi-functional products that can serve more than one single need.Overall: 4.95/5 Starts! Would absolutely recommend. Like seriously, don't hesitate!",

                "reviewText": "Cloud Whip is quite possibly my favorite Eight Saints product. This, in my opinion, is the perfect moisturizer. It is a thick and rich formulation, has great ingredients like Vitamin C, Jojoba Oil and Aloe, and absorbs quickly. It's winter here where I live, so cold wind, and hot air from car heaters are doing a number on me. Lots of moisturizers are heavy and combat dryness, but they sit greasy on the skin and absorption is poor. Cloud Whip is thick but without being heavy or greasy, and it absorbs beautifully and quickly. It is a little pricey but I find it lasts for a long time since you do not need lots.For those sensitive to scent, it comes in an unscented formula. I like the scent, its very light in my opinion and mildly citrusy, which is uplifting to mood.",

                "reviewText": "Cloud whip is my new daily moisturizer. With sensitive, eczema prone skin, it's gentle yet effective with no irritation. The scent is lovely and invigorating, fresh and citrusy. Coming out of the jar, the moisturizer is substantial, but absorbs well and doesn't leave behind any residue whatsoever. Paired with the Seeking C hyalauronic serum, it is a great regimen to kickstart the day smoothing out fine lines with a dash of aromatherapy to boot. Highly recommended!",
