                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great lightweight moisturizer!",
                "reviewText": "Super light & airy texture, and spreads like a dream! I have very sensitive, dry/combo skin that is prone to inflammation and clogged pores. I usually break out whenever I try something new, but this is one of the few products that didn't cause any adverse reaction. My cheeks didn't flare up either, which is more than I can say for most of the moisturizers I've tried in the past. Although the texture is really light (reminds me of a water cream), it's still moisturizing enough for my skin that I don't feel like I need to reapply during the spring/summer months (though I'll probably need something more substantial when it eventually gets colder). I will say that I do wish it came in a larger size; my first jar lasted about two and a half months with daily use, while my current jar will probably last me about 3 months. It's so inexpensive though compared to my previous moisturizers so I don't mind it that much.For those on the fence between this and the repair balm, I purchased both because I loved the barrier cream so much and found that the balm is much thicker and probably more suited to those with dry/very dry skin. It also has more of a matte finish which makes my skin appear almost dull compared to the subtle dewiness of this barrier cream (while the dewiness does eventually fade to a natural finish, almost like I didn't put anything on, the repair balm makes my skin look visibly matte). While the repair balm feels too heavy for me, it didn't make me break out or cause any inflammation (and I did like layering it over the barrier cream during the winter when I needed a bit more moisture in my drier spots). Another thing to note is that the repair balm jar is much smaller than the barrier cream (probably about half the size) but because I need so little of it due to the thicker texture, I think it would probably last me about the same amount of time with daily use (maybe about three months, twice that if I only used a bit of it where needed). Overall I think they're both really good moisturizers, especially for the price, but I much prefer the texture, dewiness, and lightweight nature of the barrier cream. Hope this helps! (also my previous review was deleted for some reason so I'm writing this again lol hopefully it stays up this time).Update (2/13/2024): Just wanted to do a quick update. I temporarily stopped using this cream back in October last year because I needed something a little heavier for the dry weather. I switched to the nourishing cream from this same brand, and it's been perfect. It's thicker than the barrier cream but not nearly as heavy as the repair balm. The texture is creamier than the repair balm and has a very natural finish. It definitely feels heavier than the barrier cream but it's still lightweight and keeps my skin moisturized until I wash it off (maybe avoid the nourishing cream if you have quite oily skin though). No irritation whatsoever either. I will be going back to the barrier cream once the weather starts warming up though (still in love with the airy, cloud-like texture).",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this product for 2 1/2 weeks and it\u2019s great! I pair it with the PYUNKANG YUL Low pH Pore Deep Cleansing Foam and the pyunkang yul essence toner. This is a very very light moisturizer. If you have very dry skin, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. I only use this moisturizer in the morning. At night I use the creave moisturizing lotion. It is too light to sleep in. It almost feels too light during the day but it works very well. I feel nothing on my face. This is not a greasy moisturizer. There is no smell. This would be a perfect daytime moisturizer for the summer time. It\u2019s great for winter, but only for normal to oily skin I would say. The only reason I\u2019m giving it 4 stars is because it wouldn\u2019t work for all skin types and I hate tub containers like these. I have acrylic nails so it\u2019s hard to get out. But besides that, the product itself is very good. I would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This cream feels like applying cooling cucumber water, aloe and shea butter to the skin. It's so soothing, and it's like that each time I use it. It absorbs well and it does not just sit on the skin, have any type of silicone feeling (which even some silicone-free products manage to have), or cause any hint of irritation. Perfect texture, with beautiful results. I'm very impressed with the science and medicine behind the Pyunkang Yul brand. I use this product after applying Benton's Propolis & Snail essence or Cosrx's Snail essence, and use a thicker cream if there are any areas I feel need it, but honestly, my desert island picks would be the Pyukang Yul and Benton duo because they can achieve so, so much.I just bought 2 of the new Cosrx creams for 3-4x the price of this product, and neither is as good, so I need to stop trying to fix what's working.This is fantastic for dehydrated skin and very sensitive-skin friendly, and for those looking for a fragrance-free option. For dry skin, the balm version is probably a better fit. It shouldn't lose stars for not being an occlusive moisturizer; this does something different and it does it really well. The only product I can compare it to is sold for more than 5x the cost of PY's for less than half the size and has to be purchased through that brand's site.",
