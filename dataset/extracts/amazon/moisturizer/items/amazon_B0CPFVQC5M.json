First off, this smells amazing! It\u2019s a slightly transparent gel that scoops out easily, but I would recommend using a spoon for this. This doesn\u2019t spread super easily over my skin even for it being a gel, so I found that I have to apply a fairly hefty amount to completely cover my face. This also slightly dried me out, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend this as a winter moisturizer. I left this on for a few hours, and I didn\u2019t have any severe oily skin, so this is perfect for the summer when I\u2019m sweaty!",

My experience with this brand has been that they generally make good quality products that are also affordable, and I would say that this moisturizer is on par with what I would expect from this brand in terms of quality and affordability. The texture of this moisturizer feels similar to a gel or a silicone based moisturizer, not sticky, but very smooth. It seems to absorb into the skin quickly and doesn't feel oily or leave a shine. I have extremely sensitive skin, and this didn't cause me any issues. It does have a very light fragrance, nothing too perfume-y. It's just a very light, fresh, and clean fragrance. Very mild. I love this moisturizer. It's great for my combination skin because it's very hydrating but also doesn't leave my skin feeling oily. It's wonderful. I will definitely be buying more when this one runs out.",

It is lightweight, so personally it is not ideal for me for winter nights as it does not provide as much hydration as I need, as it is too lightweight and not thick enough for my combo dry skin (right now). It is perfect as a lightweight moisturizer in the morning. Just make sure you always put sunscreen on right after (which I always do with my spf anyways). Overall, a decent lightweight gel moisturizer from elf.",

This seems better as a body lotion for my skin type.That being said it's good for that, it keeps my skin hydrated and doesn't cause any irritation. Additionally the fragrance is not overly distracting and dissipates quickly",

It doesn\u2019t feel super moisturizing but it does leave my skin looking healthier, if that makes sense. I like it so far for putting on before some other skin care products at night. The price point is great for the size of tub you get.",

I have weird combo skin where it oily in spots but also dry and flaky at the same time, and this gel seems to be working well for me so far with keeping my skin hydrated but not adding to the oil slick!",
