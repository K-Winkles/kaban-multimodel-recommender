NO other brand compares for me. I used to break out from other face moisturizers and this one has been a life saver!!",

I have subclinical acne and sensitive skin, and this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling hydrated but not sticky, not flaky, and does not cause irritation or breakouts.I use a tinted moisturizer for my full face makeup, and it pairs well with this moisturizer, it's never been a problem for me.The reason I cannot give five stars is because if I am not using this every day, by the time I get to the end of the tube, the formula seems to separate and does not adhere to my skin as easily. I assume this is because it has been exposed to air and the formula expires. Maybe this is my own fault? I can't be too sure. One tube lasts me about three months for face, neck, and chest.I've tried a lot of other moisturizers: La Roche Posay, Cetaphil, Cerave, etc. and I continue to chose this one.",

The consistency isn't as \"liquidy\" or whatever -- this stuff is certainly much thicker -- but my advice is to blend it in your hands first before applying to your face. And apply it very gently. This helps smooth it over the skin and avoid pilling. And yes, this sometimes pills but what SPF doesn't? Stop buying expensive stuff and please, for the love of God and this planet, stop experimenting with moisturizers and SPFs and skincare products in general and then throwing them out. This stuff will make your life a lot easier.",

A little goes a long way and it quickly and seamlessly seeps into the skin leaving it nice and soft. Great for morning prep, pre makeup and evening.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this lotion for my face. My skin gets really dry in the winter and this lotion has remedied that. The only other moisturizer that worked similarly well was argan oil and I could not use that as a day cream (too shiny). This cream absorbs pretty well and does not leave a sheen. It has good ingredients, no unnecessary and harmful chemicals from what I could tell (like artificial colors, or preservatives that are carcinogens). The price was reasonable. It's unscented, which works well for me (one less chemical). Will be buying this cream again.",

                "reviewText": "I have been searching for a good facial sunscreen for a while. This is unfortunately another one for my bin of sunscreen flops. Note that I have very oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin. This product was used for typical daily wear (for me, taking several 10-minute walks in the hot summer sun throughout the day). I don't sweat much, but I am typically quite oily even without moisturizing products.Pros:- Very moisturizing. It would be good for someone with very dry skin. My skin looked exceptionally well hydrated.- Unscented. My skin tends to react poorly to scented products. This had no scent.- Does protect against the sun. With proper application, I have never burned with this product.Cons:- VERY greasy. I applied just enough sunscreen to cover my skin. It felt like I was covered in an oily film. My whole face had a slick sheen to it. It was especially greasy looking in the summer sun.- Does leave a slight white cast. I would say my skin tone is lightly tanned. There was a light but noticeable white film over my whole face, even after rubbing in and drying down for 15 minutes. Would be best for those with fairer skin tones.- Thick formulation. It was difficult to apply in a uniform layer because of how thick the product was. I prefer a more liquidy formulation for even, light coverage. It felt very oily/film-like on my skin even after drying down.",

                "reviewText": "My sister in law recommended this face moisturizer to me a year ago when I was visiting her in the US. I had been struggling to find a good face moisturizer. I have sensitive skin - oily and dry combo. I was looking for a moisturizer that was fragrance free, lightweight (doesn\u2019t feel like you have a leftover film on your skin) and made of clean ingredients. This moisturizer is absolutely amazing and meets all those criteria. It also has hyaluronic acid in it which was a bonus. My skin eats this up, no reactions, and leaves my face feeling moisturized and fresh. I absolutely love it. I was so happy to see that it is sold on Amazon Canada (I\u2019m Canadian). Sure it\u2019s a little on the pricy side $28 plus tax for 89mL/3 oz but it is worth it by far for me. And you really don\u2019t need a lot when applying. Honestly when you find something that works, it\u2019s worth the money!",
