                "reviewText": "I am done with looking for a moisturizing face cream. This is it. I have combination skin. This works for me, and so my quest for it is finally done. After 3 months of using it in various weathers (from 100F to 30F), here is my review AND tips on how to use it to maximize benefits.Summary PROS:- Very moisturizing- Non-scented (huge plus!)- A little goes a long way- Considering how little you need to use, it is very cost-efficient- Absorbs quickly, but you need to find the sweet spot on the amount to put on your face- Goes well under makeup- Last line of skin care- Not an essence nor serum, but if you\u2019re looking to skip or simplify a step (of the thousand Korean skincare steps) but still add hyaluronic acid to your daily life, this is for you- Great for all weathers, however, the more hot and humid it is, the less you should apply- Is great for dry and normal skin types- Is good to ok for combination skin, but MAY need additional sebum-controlling products (recommended tips later in this review)- May be tolerable for oily skin type, but will definitely need additional sebum-controlling products (recommended tips later in this review)- Works well with both COSRX Advanced Snail 92 All in one Cream (as second to last skincare step)- Works well Korean Skin Care Snail Repair Cream (as second to last skincare step)Summary CONS:- Not an essence nor serum, so you may look down on this product- Incorrectly applying too much leads to oiliness, and possibly breakouts- For combination and oily skin types, may need additional sebum-controlling products- Need to mist water onto face before applying this cream, for maximum absorptionREVIEW:Others have said it, but I\u2019ll say it here anyways.1. You need to mist/pat water on your face before applying this cream so that it absorbs perfectly and not be greasy, oily, or sticky. You don\u2019t need a lot of water. I got this little 1 oz spray that I filled with filtered water and just spritz some on my face and neck \u2013 the water in that 1 oz spray lasted 2 months from daily use. That\u2019s how little water you need to mist onto your face. At first, I used rose water for 2 weeks. Then I changed to filtered water. It made no difference at all. It does make a difference if you don\u2019t apply any water though. Also, it was easier with a spray than just patting water on my face, because it just feels a lot less wet with a spray. I can control how much I want to mist.2. A little goes a long way. You need to play around with how much cream to apply to your face. You\u2019ll find the sweet spot on the amount after a few days or a week. I was soooo surprised with how little I needed to apply so that it is just moisturizing enough AND doesn\u2019t make me oily or make my face feel heavy and grimy. I absolutely hated this product when I first got it because I put too much on and it felt heavy and sticky, plus it looked so oily \u2013 the bottle seemed so small too that I was a bit upset with the price. I had considered The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid beforehand, but went with this Cosrx instead because it was on sale AND I hated the idea of having yet another essence/serum; I gotta say I was really regretting my decision at first. However, I didn\u2019t know I was just putting way too much in the beginning. I was putting the same amount on my face like all the other face creams I\u2019ve ever had \u2013 and that was just a big fat NO. Later, as I looked at the reviews, I realized that I may have put too much. I gave it another try. It took a whole week for me to finally accept that all I needed was about 1/10th of what I usually apply. And OMG, I just loved it. I was like, are you kidding me?? That\u2019s not possible. It was so moisturizing and not oily at all with such a tiny amount. Even in the winter\u2019s dry icy air, my face never once felt tight or dry! That has never happened in my entire life of 35 years with any face moisturizers. That was when I finally felt like I found THE moisturizer.This cream is really moisturizing if applied correctly, ie. with a little water and apply a fraction of the normal amount, it lasts you for a very long time. I transferred some into a smaller container/jar 3 months ago, and I have barely even used half of it in my travel-sized 20ml cosmetic jar. I\u2019ve used it in dry hot 100F and cold 30F, and it\u2019s great for all weathers. I do apply a bit more in colder weather than I do in hotter weather. I apply even less in humid weathers. This is the one face and neck cream that I have to be careful with how much I apply because it can be too oily. I also like that this isn\u2019t an essence/serum.While I was on board with 9 or 10 or 12 step Korean skin care thing for a couple of years, I have grown tired of it. In fact, I have grown tired of makeup. However, I still believe in Korean skincare on a whole. It\u2019s in line with my beliefs \u2013 take great care and focus of skincare first, then natural-looking makeup. I\u2019m at the age where regular face moisturizers no longer work and require something more, to help with the dryness, lines, and sag. Which is why I wanted hyaluronic acid in my skincare, but not as an essence or serum. Instead of a ton of steps, I wanted to simplify and condense the steps but still get some of the benefits. I guess I am just lazy, but I honestly can\u2019t tell the difference with this hyaluronic acid intensive cream and a pure and dedicated hyaluronic acid essence/serum. Because I can\u2019t tell the difference, I am going to stick with this cream as a face moisturizer until I get older and require more work. For now, it works and it\u2019s great. I feel my face is properly moisturized, protected, and plumped and firmed. I am just really happy with it.Regarding snail creams, they are usually not as moisturizing. However, they do work well in clearing blemishes, not clog pores, and helps the skin a bit\u2026. amongst quite a few other benefits. So, I usually put on snail cream first, mist my face with water, then finally apply this Cosrx Hyaluronic Acid Intensive Cream.Tips for combination skin and oily skin:The one thing about this cream is that no matter how little I put, I\u2019ll eventually look oily as the day progresses, and that\u2019s because I have combination skin, especially my T-zone. So I have to use a sebum-controlling mineral powder. While I have tried a lot of face moisturizers to date, I have not really tested out mineral powders. Maybe I got lucky but I only tried the Innisfree one and it happened to work perfectly. So the two I use is the Innisfree No Sebum Mineral Powder 5g 0.17oz (usually $6-7) and the Innisfree No Sebum Mineral Pact, 8.5g (usually $10). They are both essentially the same thing, but one is a pact and the other is a powder; both have their benefits and downsides. The mineral PACT is not as natural and takes longer to absorb but is more convenient to use and lasts a long time, so I only use this either at night or if I don\u2019t have to see anyone for at least 30-45 min. The mineral POWDER is more INconvenient and doesn\u2019t last as long, but it\u2019s absolutely a ton more natural-looking and absorbs right away. The powder is the one I take with me in my purse to touch up any shine when I have to see people. The pact is the one I leave at home. Sometimes, I only need to use either one once in the middle of the day and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll need to control my sebum (oils) for the rest of the day. Of course, this will vary from person to person and from weather to weather. I feel it\u2019s better than the makeup kind of pressed or loose face powders because this doesn\u2019t clog my pores, doesn't cake with multiple applications, and it doesn't dry my face out. And since it\u2019s supposed to be colorless (with the exception of the initial white when you apply it), I don\u2019t have to worry about matching it to my skin color. All this Innisfree mineral powder does is absorb and control my sebum.This powder/pact is the last thing I put on my face after moisturizers, sunblock, and/or makeup. Sometimes, I have to apply another layer after a few hours. This also helps to control my breakouts when I take omega 3. When I consider all the face products I buy, this powder/pact is something I just can\u2019t do without because of my oily, acne-prone skin. So, I no longer try to look for other sebum-controlling descriptions in moisturizers, creams, serums, and essences. As long as I have this to apply on top after everything, I feel like I can use any products now.",

I typically spend about $70 for a small jar of \u201cpremium\u201d night moisturizer. With winter here, I\u2019ve been hunting for a better product. On a whim, I bought this CosRx product. IT DELIVERS MOISTURE! This is my new favorite pm moisturizer. I am 49 and have dry, sensitive skin. I also just started using prescription retinol, making my skin even more parched than usual. I am utterly surprised by the high quality. The hype over CosRx is well deserved. I just apply it after my evening serum. I haven\u2019t had any problems with stickiness or pilling. My skin looks great and feels smooth. I highly recommend!",

I am a senior women and I have lines and wrinkles much to my dismay. I also have dry skin but this softens the dryness and wrinkles and make them less noticeable. I use these 2 a day and it makes a big difference. I went a week without using this to see if I saw a difference the results are absolute. Without it my skin was dull , painfully dry and the wrinkles I have were very pronounced. With it my skin looks healthy, moist, pumped up and has a glow. I have used many high priced products and while they do work I live on a budget. I would compare this with any of those. I personally prefer these products. I find these reviews very helpful and hope this helps others. This is absolutely a wonderful moisturizer and works great.",

It leave my skin feeling extremely moisture thought the night. It does have a velvety feel on the skin when you apply it and it doesn't mix well with the sunscreens I've tried thus far (because it's a grl cream). I will try with a new sunscreen I bought and update you. I use it lore for nighttime moisture because I can't use it with Sunscreen. I absolutely love it though. And I'll continue to repurchase for sure. The jar usually lasts about 2-3 months",

I ordered this one not expecting much but was very pleasantly surprised.It doesn't have a powerful smell, it feels great going on, it's pretty affordable and my goodness my skin actually looks downright DEWEY after I use it. The moisture lasts all day too!I recently ran out of this and picked up another Hyaluronic Acid cream at the store figuring it would give me the same results but I was so, so wrong. The other cream reeked of perfume and my skin felt dry and tight. I rushed back to Amazon to re-order this and will never run out again.If you have oily skin, this might not be the cream for you. It's definitely heavy. But if you suffer from dry skin and had given up on ever feeling moisturized - try this cream. It's the BEST.",
