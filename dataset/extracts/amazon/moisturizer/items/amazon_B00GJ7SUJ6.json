I've been a fan of SheaMoisture products for a while now because of their consistent quality, and this moisturizer did not disappoint.First of all, the 2 oz size is perfect for me as it's easy to carry around and great for on-the-go use. I have dry skin, and I'm always on the lookout for moisturizers that provide effective hydration without leaving my skin feeling greasy. This product struck the perfect balance.What I love about this moisturizer is its use of African Black Soap and Shea Butter. These natural ingredients are known for their nourishing and skin-balancing properties. After using it for a while, I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture and hydration of my skin. It has helped soothe dry patches and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.Another thing worth mentioning is the pleasant scent of this product. It's not overpowering but has a subtle, pleasant fragrance that makes the application even more enjoyable.Overall, I highly recommend the SheaMoisture Balancing Moisturizer for Dry Skin African Black Soap with Shea Butter. If you're looking for a quality moisturizer that's suitable for dry skin and packed with natural ingredients, this is definitely worth a try. It's become a staple in my skincare routine, and I couldn't be happier with the results.",

                "reviewText": "This is a combo review for the moisturizer and the Shea Moisture black soap. I am in my 40s and have suffered with adult acne for YEARS. I have tried EVERYTHING over the years, including prescription antibiotic gel, Proactiv, BC pills, and just about every other product, and nothing has ever worked. Nothing. I believe my breakouts are mostly caused by hormones, so I was just about to give up and accept my skin. I have combination skin, but it's very sensitive. Even supposedly hypoallergenic products didn't help.Well, after only a few days of using this moisturizer in conjunction with their black soap and toner, my face is completely bump free!! I bought the soap first, and I had a moderate breakout the very first day and figured it was another dud. Boy was I wrong! The soap is drying, so I needed a great moisturizer and this was it! After using this moisturizer and the soap, I am clearing up very nicely and maybe now some of these old acne scars can finally heal. It's not greasy feeling on your skin like most moisturizers, and it absorbs very quickly so I wasn't sure it was going to keep my skin hydrated, but so far it's great. My skin is soft and shine free, and makeup goes on great after using it. I love this line!!",
