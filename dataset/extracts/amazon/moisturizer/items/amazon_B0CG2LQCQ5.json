This is a pale white cream, fragrance free and just a few small dabs will suffice to cover the facial surface. The product comes in a rounded plastic pump dispenser and comes with 1.7 ounces of lotion. Formulation is built around ceramides, peptides and watermelon seed oil to nourish and replenish the skin barrier along with moisturization and wrinkle reduction benefits. The cream quickly absorbs into the skin and leaves a natural and nourished appearance with no sheen. Effective for both day and night usage.",

So, I decided to try this RESIST Barrier Repair Advanced Moisturizer and see if it would help moisturize my dry/combination skin. So far I've been pretty impressed. This moisturizer is quite light and has a good texture. It soaks into my skin quickly and so far hasn't left any residue or greasy film as some moisturizers do. The moisturizer does have a light sort of lotion-y smell, but it's not overpowering at all. Overall, I'm pretty pleased with this moisturizer and would definitely consider picking it up again.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this for my (almost) 40 year old skin. I have a hard time with heavy moisturizers, so i was looking for something light and I liked this PM moisturizer because it doesn't have SPF in it - something that I don't need or what in a moisturizer in the evening.I felt like one pump of this was enough to cover my face and neck and it felt light going on, and then weightless on my skin afterward. This is going to last quite a while given that one pump is all I need, so I can't even contemplate buying more right now.Hydration: I would say it's pretty hydrating for my skin, which is pretty normal with oil production. I felt like the moisturization feeling lasted, but wasn't greasy, and that's exactly what I want out of a moisturizer.The only think I don't like about it is the \"unscented\" scent. It smells like. . .lotion. It fades once it's on your skin but I'd honestly prefer a little scent to block out the unscented lotion chemical smell. That's likely a me thing.",
