I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I have to say, I'm impressed.This cream is specially formulated for men's skin, which is great because let's be honest, our skin has different needs than women's. It delivers powerful anti-aging and wrinkle-fighting benefits, thanks to key ingredients like collagen and hyaluronic acid. And let me tell you, my skin feels smoother and more hydrated since I started using it.But it's not just about reducing fine lines and wrinkles \u2013 this cream also contains vitamins E and A, as well as avocado oil, which all work together to protect my skin from environmental damage and oxidative stress. And the fact that it's made in the USA with only the finest ingredients gives me peace of mind that I'm not putting any harsh chemicals or artificial additives on my skin.The formula is light and non-greasy, which is a huge plus for me because I don't like feeling like I have something heavy on my skin. And I love that it's perfect for use after shaving \u2013 it soothes my skin and keeps it hydrated all day long.Overall, I highly recommend Wilder's Prime Men's Face Moisturizer Cream. It's a great addition to my daily skincare routine and has definitely made a difference in the appearance and feel of my skin. So if you're looking for a high-quality moisturizer that's specifically designed for men's skin, give this one a try \u2013 you won't be disappointed!",

I've used different moisturizers in the past, all of which worked well-enough but nothing as significant as the quality that seems to provide me. I use it after showering and drying off. It I use it everywhere on my face and neck with the exception of around my eyes (I use their eye moisturizer product for that).While I haven't been mistaken for being 10 years younger, it has made a significant difference in the quality of my skin, a reduction in the appearance of wrinkles and a general appearance of well-ness.Would like to see it in larger sizes. Definitely recommend this moisturizer and am keen to try more from the company's product line.",

                "reviewText": "The product isn\u2019t bad, but I do believe there are better options for the price point. The container is smaller than I thought it would be and again, for the price point I was slightly disappointed. The texture is thick lotion-like. It doesn\u2019t feel greasy on the skin which is a plus, but it does feel kind of heavy. I prefer to use it in the evening. The product itself is good, but the price point is unreasonable.",

                "reviewText": "I waited to do a review until I had some time to use it. I love this cream.It\u2019s smooth and has a soft, soothing smell. It doesn\u2019t leave you feeling oily afterwards and it absorbs right into your skin. After a couple weeks, I noticed my appearance starting to change. It evens out my skin tone and tightens up the skin, giving a youthful glow.I\u2019ve been trying to find the right cream for some time now so I was willing to spend money for the right product. Fortunately, this is a great price for the quality of the product. I cannot recommend this cream enough! You will love it!",
