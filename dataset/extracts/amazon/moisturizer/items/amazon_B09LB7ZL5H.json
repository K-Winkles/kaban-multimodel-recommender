My face has always been really really oily, and bc of my oily skin and me not finding a cream or lotion that won't add more oil to my skin or that wouldn't break me out I gave up aling time ago. I randomly saw this on Amazon and decided, since it's Cyber Monday, I'll try it out! I came in the mail today and I washed my face and put it on afterwards, and I am very pleased & happy I purchased it! It's been on for 3 hours now, no oil and no breakouts!!! My face feels amazing, super clean and fresh! Not to mention it smells wonderful! I definitely recommend it.",

And it was pretty affordable the only thing think is that it doesn\u2019t have that much moisturizer in the container. I loved the packaging cause it was cute and pink. It was good quality and it seemed very moisturizing throughout the day. I have purchased this before and would repurchase and recommend it. The only thing is seems not the most hygienic since you have to redip to get the moisturizer.Full credit to cvs for the photo. I didn\u2019t want to take a photo of it.",

When I use certain products I either dry my skin out too much or make it too oily, which then causes breakouts.So far with this moisturizer I have not had any problems. My skin feels perfectly moisturized after I put it on and does not look Shiny all. I would definitely recommend using this if you have complicated skin.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m a huge fan of water creams and water gel moisturizers. I\u2019ve been looking for an alternative to Belif Aqua Bomb because it\u2019s very pricey. This product is not it, though the price point is hard to beat for a water cream. This could be a good option for someone seeking a very very light moisturizer.The texure is grainy. It doesn\u2019t feel exfoliating or anything on the skin, but it\u2019s just not the smooth, refreshing application I\u2019m looking for. It also leaves a tacky residue on my skin, which is a no-go for me. I\u2019m looking for matte.The smell is neutral and fine, neither stinky nor heavily perfumed. Hasn\u2019t irritated my skin at all. It doesn\u2019t feel particularly moisturizing though. My skin is dry right now, so maybe it\u2019d hold up better for someone who just needed a very light moisturizer, or lived in a humid area.",

You can actually feel your skin being moisturized and it stays. Because it is matte though, you will get to a point where it is no longer smooth so beware if your looking for a lotion type feeling. I personally love this product and would buy it again. It works really well under makeup too!",

It felt like a steal. :) I gave one to my mom, and kept the other.It has a whipped texture, light and fresh fragrance. Upon application it is a bit sticky, but it dries down within a couple of minutes. It makes my skin feel soft and slightly waxy (but not in a bad way, also I may have applied too much), but that could be the glycerin and dimethicone in it. It's not a bad feeling though. I feel as if the moisture is locked in, and I have a barrier against the Canadian winter weather.",
