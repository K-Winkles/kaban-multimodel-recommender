                "reviewText": "I'll apply this at night, and it is so hydrating that in the morning, I can tap around my eye area and still feel the cream on it. Every other eye cream I've tried (such as Cerave) dries quickly and has no lasting effect on my eyes. It keeps my eyes so supple and hydrated. It helps with the puffiness and instantly brightens my under eyes as it has a slight shimmer/highlighter effect to it. My eyes feel and look so hydrated all day. ALSO smells so good! The scent is not overpowering - it's like a light orchid perfume and I can smell it on me at times throughout the day. This is my first Innisfree product, and I will be definitely checking out the rest of them, especially their orchid products. Please never change the formula! Will be repurchasing! Finally found my holy grail eye cream!",

Application is smooth and satisfying, and the floral scent is pleasant yet not too strong. My issue is with the size of the product. In about two months, I\u2019ve barely made a dent in it. With a PAO (period after opening) of 12 months, I really doubt I\u2019ll finish the pot within a year. I\u2019d love to see this product sold in smaller sizes so it can be used completely before the PAO is up!",

I found it in this cream! Your skin will thank you after one night of this hydration. The scent is mild and the cream is not greasy feeling. It is too heavy to wear under makeup, but perfect for nighttime wear.",
