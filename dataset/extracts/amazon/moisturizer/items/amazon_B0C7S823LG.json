        "description": "What is the Freeman Restorative Moisturizer & Hydrating Skin Shield? It is a lightweight moisturizer that helps to soothe irritated skin from environmental stressors and relieve dryness. We love this facial moisturizer as it is the perfect daily moisturizer for sensitive skin. Aloe helps to soothe your skin, while Ceramides help to lock in moisture on your face. Our skincare treatments are made with a Restorative Moisture Formula to improve the overall look and feel of your skin! The fatty acids protect your skin against environmental damage, while glycerin supports the skin\u2019s natural barrier. The PH buffer promotes balanced skin. Since 1976, we\u2019ve created feel-good formulas that seriously work (without losing all the fun!). We believe skincare belongs to everyone and strive to democratize beauty with affordable products. In our minds, clear skin = a clear conscious. Our top priority is ensuring our products are efficacious and full of good-for-you ingredients. Our new formulas are always dermatologist tested, free of parabens, sulfates, phthalates and mineral oil. We love our furry friends, too, and are proudly cruelty-free and never test on animals. From breakouts and blemishes to sensitive and dull complexions, we\u2019re here to educate you on how to take care of your unique skin. We believe skincare is more than a routine... It\u2019s about feeling good from the inside out!",

It is easy to apply with a gel-like texture that is absorbed quickly, leaving a very pleasant sensation of freshness. The aroma is pleasant and very faint. I like its hyaluronic acid content because it is a very effective moisturizer. It is suitable for many applications. The price is Incredibly affordable for such a good quality cream, I am very happy with this purchase, and I will buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "I use this 30 minutes before going to bed and when I wake up I am duwey and hydrated. This is okay product for tired skin. I love how easily accessible Freeman products are for all level of income. I've been using this brand since 1993 and they don't disappoint. However I do feel that the Peel off products had changed their formulas since then. I am glad they are having set of creams and serums that make skincare available for all income status. You don't need to overspent for good skin.This cream is smooth and a little goes a long way and spreads easily. I use a dime size amount each night, focusing on the forehead and chin area. I had noticed more hydrated skin than usual. My forehead tends to crack due to driness. This helps so much. The smell isn't over powering and if you use a little it wouldn't be sticky. Make sure you let it absorb into skin before going to bed. Again a little goes a long way. This jar can last a year or more.",

I'm 37, for reference. I got this for a preventative , but I didn't notice much, but hydration.",

                "reviewText": "I've tried other Freeman face products, specifically the Skin Shield moisturizer, & I love it, so based on the reviews of this eye cream, how great the face moisturizer is, & the excellent price, I had to try the eye cream. I am just as impressed with it as I am the face moisturizer. It goes on so easily, no tugging on the skin at all, it is not heavy, works great under makeup, & my eye area stays moisturized all day long. Some eye creams make the skin around your eyes feel tight & dry shortly after you apply it, but this cream does not. I had zero eye irritation whatsoever, which for me is important due to having very sensitive skin around my eyes. A little goes a long way, so the small container of the product will go a VERY long way. Don't hesitate to buy this little gem of a product.",

Used it for about 2 weeks with no issues but woke up one day and my eyelid seemed a little irritated. Throughout the day, it seemed to turn pink and look almost slightly swollen. The next morning, I woke up and it was very swollen and tender to the touch. It\u2019s been about 2 weeks since this has happened and my eye is still not back to normal. It was swollen for days, still very sensitive and I am only able to put vitamin e oil on it without pain.",
