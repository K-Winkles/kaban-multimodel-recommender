                "reviewText": "This organic lotion was the perfect complement to the foaming baby shampoo. It was completely unscented, and just the right amount of smoothness/oiliness to hydrate my newborn's skin. After receiving many lectures on why \"natural\" doesn't always mean good for sensitive skin, I think even my pediatrician mother would approve of this product because it is very, very plain and moisturizes well. No hidden scents or colors, etc. It left her skin nice and soft like it should. I would recommend this to anyone concerned with both what's in their baby's skincare and how well it works. This lotion has you covered!I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. My opinions are my own.",
