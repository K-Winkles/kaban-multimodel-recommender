                "reviewText": "So, I think like this product so far, but the scented one is strongly and unnecessarily scented. Like overpowering, burned my eyes the first time I used it-- strong. The unscented was sold out before I bought this one, but I wouldn't mind giving that version a try next time it's in stock.Overall, I do feel like this helps reduce fine lines and restore a bit of moisture, so I would recommend it for that part. It does seem a bit greasy, but my skin absorbs that a few hours after having it on. A little goes a long way.",

                "reviewText": "I recently started using the L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Collagen Daily Face Moisturizer, and I'm absolutely thrilled with the results! This product has quickly become an essential part of my skincare routine.First and foremost, the fragrance-free formula is a game-changer for me. It's gentle on my sensitive skin and doesn't cause any irritation. This is a huge plus, as I've had trouble with scented products in the past.The texture of this face cream is just perfect - it's creamy, yet light, and absorbs quickly into the skin. It leaves my face feeling hydrated without any greasiness. I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture of my skin since I started using this moisturizer. It feels smoother and looks more radiant.One of the main reasons I chose this product was for its collagen-boosting properties. As I've gotten older, I've started to notice fine lines and wrinkles appearing. After consistent use, I can confidently say that this moisturizer has made a noticeable difference in reducing the appearance of those wrinkles. My skin looks plumper and more youthful.I also appreciate that it comes in a generous 1.7 oz size, so it lasts a long time. A little goes a long way, so I feel like I'm getting great value for my money.Overall, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Collagen Daily Face Moisturizer has exceeded my expectations. It's a fantastic addition to my skincare routine and has become a staple product in my collection. If you're looking for a reliable, effective, and fragrance-free moisturizer to combat wrinkles and improve skin texture, this is definitely worth a try. I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I'd give this 10 stars if i could. I have tried so many moisturizers and this is now by far the best! I was someone who always thought you had to pay more to get results. But with prices so high on everything, I felt it was time I looked for a more budget friendly alternative to some of my high end products. This has shocked me it's that good. I've been using for 3+ months because I wanted to really test it and I started seeing results after 30 days. My skin is very moisturized in the AM after putting it on before bed. Also, it sinks right into the skin so it works with my foundation. Fine lines definitely appear softened. I highly recommend this moisturizer. You won't be disappointed.",

I used to get Botox, but it has been close to 2 years since I haven't gotten any injections. I imagine if I had started this cream before, I would have delayed the Botox \"needs\" for much longer down the road. It keeps my skin moisturized and reduces fine wrinkles, which can be noticed immediately after the first application. It also makes my makeup look much nicer and smooth. :) As far as sensitivity, my skin isn't sensitive. I am biracial olive tan, so I can't give an opinion there other than to apply a small amount to try first and see how it works for you if you have sensitive skin.",
