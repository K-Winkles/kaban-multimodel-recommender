The presentation is perfect - the safety sealed high quality packaging, the light scent that is pleasant, but not overpowering, the consistency of the cream itself which spreads easily and absorbs quickly into your skin. I love this cream! Importantly, while this is luxurious to use it also delivers results. I\u2019ve been using this for about four weeks and I\u2019m already pleased by the improvements in the appearance of my skin. I like that it contains hyaluronic acid which, in my opinion, is one of the best anti-aging ingredients. I have sensitive skin and have not experienced any irritation while using this product.",

                "reviewText": "I am really particular about my skincare products and have tried just about everything out there. I am never a fan of added artificial fragrance so that immediately deducts a star for me, especially when the fragrance is as strong as it is in this cream. But, with that said, I wanted to give this a very fair chance because I really like what I read about the product on the Lancome website and obviously, it isn't cheap so I figured it must have something excellent to offer. My Mom is in her 80's and has the most spectacular skin, seriously, she hasn't done anything, but stay out of the sun and faithfully and diligently apply her favorite creams morning and night, without fail. She has used the Lancome Absolue line for years and swears by it, but I have never been a fan because of the fragrance. So I thought if this didn't work for me, I could let her try it.So, onto my experience with this cream...I have super sensitive skin and am always extra cautious when trying something new. I decided to stick with my entire skin care routine as it is, serums and all and then use this cream on half of my face while continuing to use my go to intensive moisture balance on the other side. This is a day cream so I only use it in the morning, under makeup. Once I got past the fragrance, which doesn't really dissipate hours later unfortunately, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this performs equally well as my usual daytime moisturizer and provides a great surface for my foundation...just perfect on that front. I have used it every day for a week now and I can't say that I see any immediate changes to wrinkles which wouldn't be expected. I have been closely comparing each side of my face over the week and the only difference I noticed is that the side of my face with the Lancome cream looks maybe the slightest bit redder, like maybe it is getting slightly irritated, not sure though? But, I am someone who can break out into a sandpaper like rash with all kinds of different products so the fact that this didn't create bumps, rash or major irritation is impressive. My skin has been looking good on both sides overall so I don't know...I think I will keep using this, but again, the fragrance is just such a deterrent for me.Also, I really don't love the jar packaging. I much prefer a tube because I can just squeeze a little out as opposed to having to expose the whole product to air and dip my fingers in and out of it. Overall, if you are fine with fragrances, I would say this is definitely worth trying, but only time will tell if this is actually making a difference...I think it has potential (but please make a fragrance free version Lancome, pretty please?!)",

The cream it self is so rich and moisturizing and I love the smell. It glides on like a dream and does not clog my pores or make my skin feel overly greasy before going to bed. It doesn't wear off on my pillowcase either and in the morning my pores look smaller and my skin is so hydrated. Absolutely impressed with this and look forward to the long term results!",

For older and mature skin, there is still a need for a more hydrating moisturizer or serum since this alone does not leave my skin well hydrated. I apply the moisturizer in both my morning and nighttime routines. I also apply a sunscreen after the moisturizer in my daytime routine. I have not noticed any changes to fine lines on my face or skin but have noticed some dark spots becoming lighter.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using my Lanc\u00f4me R\u00e9nergie Lift Multi Action night cream for a couple months, but wanted something I could use during the day too (the night one is pretty heavy). This is a great daytime equivalent. It\u2019s certainly luxe; the packaging was beautiful and the cream feels expensive. I know there\u2019s a lot of mature women who swear by this line.I\u2019m hoping to lighten some age spots that have gotten darker on my cheeks and forehead, and smooth fine (and deep) lines. I\u2019m 42, so hopefully it\u2019s not too late. Even if this helps preserve time, I\u2019m all for it. My skin seems to love niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, plus it soaks all the peptides right up.My only issue with Lanc\u00f4me skincare is the fragrance. It smells very pleasant, but it\u2019s perfumey. Isn\u2019t that worse for aging skin? Seems like an unnecessary additive. If you\u2019re sensitive to fragrance, it isn\u2019t for you.It\u2019s been a few days and my skin is glowy and supple. No noticeable changes to skin texture or dark spots. I have to say, if I had to choose between this and Augustinus Bader\u2019s The Rich cream (my all time favorite), I\u2019d choose The Rich. That turned my perimenopausal acne around so fast! Both creams are expensive, but that one had almost immediate results AND doubles as an amazing primer before makeup. This one leaves my skin a little too shiny.Just my experience! If you can afford this and love Lanc\u00f4me, you\u2019ll be happy with this product.",
