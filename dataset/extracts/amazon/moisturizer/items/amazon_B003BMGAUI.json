The radiance is so natural but very noticeable, people always ask me what moisturizer I use that makes my skin so glowy! When I realized stores were starting to not carry it I would buy 2/3 at a time. It was always $10 to $12.But now at $32 I\u2019m finding it hard to keep buying, annnd I think they have lessoned the main ingredients. It\u2019s still good but the radiance is much less! I\u2019m now in my late 60s and still wrinkle free! I garden so I get lots of sun, this cream has a great sunblock! But for $32 I\u2019m finding it more a luxury than a daily cream! But I will continue to use it because it\u2019s just that good!Update:But whooo it\u2019s $60 now!! Unbelievable! I think me and this moisturizer have to break up!!!

The Alpha hydroxy plus the sunscreen was the perfect combination. It used to be $10 and now it is $60 probably because we can\u2019t get it anymore. They need to bring this back as I am now 70 and have no wrinkles after 20 yrs of using this product. Who made that decision anyway? \ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude1f",

THIS PRODUCT PREVENTS SUN SPOTS Y'ALL! It works. I don't know what I would do if they discontinued it. It's amazing, affordable, and keeps the spots of age away. It's age defying. Please note - this stuff burns, but that's how you know it's working. Good Glycolic acid always burns. Also, it's heavily scented, but even if this product smelled like cat piss i'd still use it because it keeps me looking young. I'm 40, but look 30 because of this product.",

Before I moved to the UK a year ago, though, I had finally decided that this was the best I had ever used. When I couldn't find it in stores here (UK; don't know why my profile says I'm still in Corpus), I tried using other moisturizers. I saw the error of my ways, and decided to just pay the little bit extra that it costs here (it's only $10 in the States), and order it from Amazon. I'm definitely happy with that decision. Why do I love it?The lotion delivers the perfect amount of moisture for the day. It doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky at all. It feels nice; hydrated and SOFT! I've never broken out while using this lotion, AND it does seem to smooth (or at least plump out) wrinkles. Also, one bottle seems to last me about four or five months. Finally, you gotta love that it has SPF.It's an all-around great moisturizer, and I really can't recommend it enough.",
