No. Does it work very well for a college student who needed something cheap? Absolutely. Putting the drawers in is like a puzzle, and I DO recommend screwing things in my hand because the wood is cheap, but the slides are smooth, it holds all the clothes I need it to and, again, it was inexpensive. By myself, it took about 2 hours to put together. Well, 2.5 but I took a snack break. Don\u2019t expect luxury furniture for $200? Then this is for you. It looks great. Had all the pieces intact. The box this ships in is RIDICULOUSLY heavy (Well over 100lbs), so have a friend help you carry it.",

It lacks good sturdiness after assembled and there assembling instructions need a lot of improvement.To South Shore:The design and look is good, wonderful. The holes are where they ought to be. If you really want to improve the wood quality, use the wood labelled P that runs across the base to make the entire dresser and provide a good assembling guide. Rise the price a little afterwards and costumers will still appreciate your product.To Buyers:Save your money for a better quality. With the quality for wood used, the dresser as not worth more than $75, shipping included. It looks good but quality and longevity is bad. (The only good thing I can commend South Shore for with regards to the dresser is, if you have a broken part due to shipping mishandling, contact them and they will send you a replacement part for free. That's good quality service)",

It is great quality for the price, my husband and I put it together in about 1.5 hours. The drawers are a bit shallow, but again to be able to get a whole bedroom set (two dressers and two nightstands) of this type for $500 is an amazing deal. Don\u2019t expect something that\u2019s going to win an award. But if you are looking for some sturdy, cute, functional furniture and don\u2019t want to spend thousands of dollars, would 1000% recommend. :)",

                "reviewText": "I am not going to lie. The box was extremely heavy when I received it. When assembling, everything came in great shape in the box. The labels for the pieces are a little difficult to find (on the edge of the wood marked by faint black letters). The directions were not the best. The nails, screws.. etc. we\u2019re not also labeled the best. I recommend using a screw gun, not a screw driver as mentioned, otherwise you will get carpel tunnel. I assembled it and somehow, the dresser still is not piecing together like it should. My dad will be visiting to help to try to reassemble. It took me 4 hours to assemble\ud83d\ude43Overall, I highly recommend this dresser, it is amazing for the price. It just is not a walk in the park to assembled like I assumed.",

Great.2. What we did not know until we were in the final stages of putting it together... The drawers are DIFFERENT HEIGHTS. So if you put the taller drawer in the smaller slot, it WONT fit. So you will think it wasnt put together correctly. The TALLER drawers go at the bottom. REMEMBER THAT.3. Kind of goes along with #2... I saw a lot of reviews saying the drawers didnt close well, and that they didnt fit. I guarantee you 100% that its because the taller drawers were not at the bottom. Just keep that in mind. VERY easy fix.4. The dresser is heavy. Very sturdy. Definitely recommend.It didnt take any longer to put this together than it would any other dresser. The color is gorgeous. And for what you pay for it? DEFINITELY worth it.Now go get your dresser!",

We did have issues with 3 major pieces arriving smashed and cracked, HOWEVER, I emailed South Shore directly and they responded the next day with their apologies (even though I\u2019m sure they had nothing to do with the damage) and tracking info for the replacement pieces. They are a great company with awesome customer service. So don\u2019t worry if pieces arrive damaged, because they will replace them for free. All I did was email them my product number, info on the exact damaged pieces along with pictures of the damage, my original shipment tracking info, and my address. One email was all it took. I didn\u2019t even have to go to the trouble of returning the damaged pieces. The dresser is very stylish and sturdy.",

There are 4 larger drawers and 2 smaller. This is not explained. If you have trouble building the drawers try different pieces because they are not labeled according to which size drawer you are building. The 2 smaller drawers go on the top. Also not mentioned in instructions forcing us to rearrange them many times to get them in the right locations. Worst thing I've ever put together. Oh yeah, some of the hardware was missing also so good luck.",

This is right on front of the dresser and visible from the front. The top piece had a huge crack right down the middle! Many of the pieces are scratched, dinged, or broken right in half. The only reason why we kept it is because it is such a heavy big item that we had no box in which to repackage it, as the box torn upon opening. Since I have no way to rerun it, it means I paid all this money for a dresser that looks like it had been used for years and been used roughly.",
