                "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2023",
                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Dresser (and best instructions ever)",
                "reviewText": "HEIGHT: For reference, I am about 5'5.5\" so you can see me standing next to the dresser. I know that's what I wanted to know most when I was thinking about buying it.INSTRUCTIONS: Even if I didn't love the finished product, I'd give this 10 stars just for the assembly instructions. The manual is very clear and the items are all well-labeled. Whoever wrote these instructions should give classes to everyone else! On top of that, everything was well-packaged. You will end up with a lot of trash to dump!ASSEMBLY TIME: The dresser only took me about 1.5 hours to assemble - but I am older and have a bad back and knees. I had to rest up quite often. Someone in better shape could knock this out in no time. (NOTE: Use the included Allen wrench for the B screws to get them super tight.)RESULTS: As for the finished look, I couldn't be more pleased. I have been resisting anything with fabric drawers but finally gave in and I'm not sorry. The drawers are pretty stable with the bottom inserts. Is it sturdy? Yes. A fairly strong child could shake it (and I suggest using the wall anchoring) but I have no problems with it being wobbly. A couple of the drawers (the smallest ones) were a bit stiff the first time I was inserting them into place but that got better soon. Also, this is meant (for me) to hold some clothing in the lower and larger drawers. I love the very narrow top-center drawers for holding costume jewelry and some hair ornaments. The larger top-side drawers are perfect for socks, scarves, gloves, and other light items. They can hold a lot of light items and I have a ton of scarves and hair wraps to store.COLOR: As for the color of the \"black\" one, I worried that it wouldn't be dark enough to compliment my black metal bed frame and black curtains. It works though. It is black but the pattern on the front softens the color a tiny bit. I like it. It's pretty true (in an LED-lit bedroom) to the color shown in my photos, maybe a tiny bit darker in person. I hope that helps.TIP: Some of the drawers might feel a bit tight the first time you insert them. Give the dresser time to \"settle\". Once I had all the drawers inserted and opened and closed them a few times, they were smoother moving. Also, this would be SUPER sturdy if I had anchored it to the wall. I didn't (no kids around) and the dresser is sturdy enough for me as is.Overall, I'm really happy with this - the look and usability. I was disappointed at not finding an affordable (for me) dresser with wooden drawers. Now I'm kind of in love with this. It will be easier for moving house or just rearranging furniture.(NOTE: There is a nasty chemical-like smell to the insides of the drawers. I sprayed them liberally with Odo Ban before using them.)",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this on the 22nd of March. I will mention this takes longer than your typical 2 day prime. It was supposed to be here between the 31st and 6th and I received it on the 29th. So first off I was pleased to get it earlier than I anticipated! Before I even received the item customer service reached out personally on Amazon to let me know it was on its way and informing me if I had any questions or issues with delivery to message them. Then 3 days after receiving it they messaged again to ensure I had gotten the dresser and to remind me to lock the rack in place for safety. I hadn't gotten it together at that point and let them know, and they were very polite in telling me to contact that if I had any questions on assembly. I'd never had a company take such care in ensuring things went well like that.When opening the box I was surprised to see extra support put in place to keep the box intact and to protect the product from damage. I had never seen something(aside from electronics) packaged so nicely to keep the item safe like that.Instead of your typical furniture item with a million different pieces, this one had some pieces pre-assembled making it very easy to put together! They provide you with all the tools you need for the job, and everything came together quickly and correctly the first time! It was one of the easiest furniture items this large that I've assembled.The drawers are made of fabric, but they are very sturdy and spacious. For my husband and I we easily fit our clothes in the bottom 8 drawers. We have a little one on the way and plan on using the top drawers for baby clothes and diapers and such. I cannot wait to start filling it up more. It looks great in my space and doesn't take up a lot of room.I highly recommend this dresser and this company! This was definitely worth the price and I will certainly be looking to buy from them again in the future.",

                "reviewText": "I found it easy to assemble; the instructions were quite clear. I didn't keep track of actual time spent on putting it together, as I was also watching true crime videos on YouTube at the same time...as you do... Storage is great. I was worried about purchasing it, because I've never used heavy canvas storage bins before, but I took a chance and I'm glad I did. It fits my needs perfectly and looks good too. It is much lighter than wood furniture, yet it is sturdy. Im not disappointed in the least.I am amending my review to say that a couple reviews said that it was uneven, cheap, drawers don't fit right, blah blah blah. I would like to encourage anyone who is contemplating the purchase of this dresser to realize that you shouldn't tighten the bolts down until the unit is completely assembled to ensure that it is square.",
