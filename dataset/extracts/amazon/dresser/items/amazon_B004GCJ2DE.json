Ikea was actually super out of stock of everything (due to covid) and my malm dresser was completely broken after 6 years. I thought this was actually easier to put together than ikea furniture. It's not hard- just time consuming. Directions were super easy to understand. One of the pieces came broken, however it was the last step of the main dresser. I called customer service and literally instantly was speaking to an ACTUAL person!!! She asked me what I needed, confirmed address, and told me it would be at my house within 5 days and it sure was! I was very happy, it was even after work hours. You get what you pay for, obviously this is not real wood, but it is pretty and cheap- just what I needed!",

I'm sure it is meant more for a child's room or nursery because of the depth of the drawers. I only wanted it for socks, underwear, pajamas, tees, exercise clothes etc lighter stuff... But it could hold sweeters and jeans, hoodies you name it. It just couldn't hold many adult sized ones. I estimate each drawer could hold maybe 6 large adult sized sweatshirts... This is not a unit that can take a lot of rough handling. It's meant to be used for it's intended purpose only... If you purchase for a young child's room please safely secure it to the wall with the safety screw provided.",

                "reviewText": "At first, I was a bit reluctant to buy this dresser because the handle design is not something I am looking for but I am glad that I bought this anyway. I like a modern dresser look and this doesn't seem to fit to my taste at first.I had a little bit of difficulty assembling this by myself but overall it's easy to assemble and with a very detailed assembly instructions as well.On sturdiness, if you are moving out from your current resident to a different location, may have a hard time moving this item. It doesn't look sturdy enough for moving but it's good to keep in one place. It's definitely more sturdy than the last dresser I had. Not only that the assembly is way too difficult but also it fell apart too soon.This also needs proper care meaning you cannot store too much stuff that will go over the weight limit or this won't last long. I use this to store Blu Ray DVD discs, remote controls, my mom's medicine, some paperwork filings and lightweight books below.Overall, I am happy with this purchased and would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice sturdy dresser.",

                "reviewText": "Update 11/1 - within a month of being put together the front of one of the drawers came off. The screws had stripped through the wood. I tried repairing with wood glue, but it still wouldn't hold. This was a drawer that was barely ever opened, not like one that I'm in multiple times per day or even once a day. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS. The quality is clearly severely subpar.It's barely 3 stars. It arrived with one of the slim, front pieces snapped in half, which isn't surprising since half of the pieces are compressed wood and the other half are MAYBE compressed wood or cardboard or some sort of composite. Those pieces are very light in comparison to the rest, and it wouldn't take much at all to crack them.I went ahead and used some wood glue (which didn't really work since the material seemed to just absorb it) and put it together anyway since 1) it was a non-load bearing piece and 2) this thing is incredibly heavy and it would be an absolute nightmare to try and return.It took quite a while to put together, but I don't think that's surprising when you're talking about a dresser. It was fairly easy, just time consuming. It includes a little touch up pen, which I used to fill in the white/tan line where the front piece was cracked.At the end, it looks pretty decent, but the issues are things not obvious unless you're really looking. I was careful in putting it together correctly, but for some reason the left side seems to sit a little wide. So the drawers are flush on the right side, but there's a definite (maybe 1/4-1/3\") gap on the left side. I tried adjusting and tightening to no avail. And the top 2/3 of the back and the bottom of the drawers aren't wood at all. The upper back is just a piece of cardboard tacked on (which in my experience never holds up long term), and the drawer bottoms are some sort of plasticy cardboard with the company name stamped ALL over them (really???)The drawers have wheels in the tracks and move easily, despite what I read in some other reviews. It seems sturdy even without using the bracket to mount to the wall.At the end of the day, it's not a bad dresser, but it's not great. I was looking for something a little better quality than say Walmart, but I ended up with something pretty much on par with that but at least twice the price. So it's pretty disappointing.",

The dresser may rattle loose with use over time since there was no gluing involved but I have had similar products need perioding retightening, not really a problem. I like that the entire back is made of wood product not just a thin cardboard backing like most. The drawer slides are strong metal and work very smoothly. I bought the dresser on \"Warehouse deals\" and it was supposed to be grey but ended up being black and had a small cracked piece that was easily fixed. Since it is for extra storage, it doesn't really matter but I would have been upset if it was a full price item. This product would not be easy to return. One more thing to note, this product came well packed with cardboard inserts and only used plastic and foam where it was needed not like some items these days that seem to have more plastic packaging than item.",

                "reviewText": "After nearly 2 hours putting this together, (with the help of a professional who uses tools for a living and builds furniture as a hobby,) we realized that the drawers don't fit properly in the slide mechanism either due to being slightly too small, or just as a result of poor slide mechanisms. (You can see from the pics that they are assembled properly.)The quality problem is apparent looking at the spacing between drawers. The spacing changes every time the drawers are removed and reinserted because the drawers simply don't latch properly. There is no way these will stand the test of time with the weight of clothes inside.I would return these if they weren't so heavy and difficult to disassemble/repack. After contacting the company, they blamed our assembly. I regret not going to Ikea and will probably have to go there in a couple of months to replace these.*Update: I finally got a refund for this item based on Amazon's A to Z guarantee after South Shore repeatedly blamed me for improper assembly and asked me to call an external customer service number. (No matter what the issue is, this company will put the burden on you to prove it's not your fault for improper assembly. They even told me they often have professionals and engineers who are unable to put the dressers together correctly. Still, they blame the customers.I have yet to throw this item away, but wanted to update on why the drawers were not fitting into the smaller than normal slides in the first place. The small wooden pegs and screws holding the frame of the dresser together weren't enough to hold the weight of it together. (Even before putting anything inside the dresser.) After a couple of weeks, the frame separated more and more, until the drawers just collapsed. (See the last pic.) At that point, it became apparent that the drawers didn't fit because the frame was spreading not because I didn't assemble it at a perfect 90 degree angle as a rep had told me. (I wonder how that is even possible to assemble it improperly with pre-drilled holes.) This is poorly designed with cheap materials to look like a dresser for a couple of days, but is otherwise completely unusable and dangerous. Don't waste your time.",
