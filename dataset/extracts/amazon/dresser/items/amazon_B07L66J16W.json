But it comes completely in pieces, and will take you a long time to put together and you need to be prepared for that. The directions aren't the best but they aren't the worst either, just take your time and step by step... I just watched youtube videos on my phone while I put it together but again - took me 5 hours. I am also 8.5 months pregnant so that also may have slowed me down, but I am pretty sure it still would have taken me a long time to put together. I did it by myself but I have a feeling if I did it with my husband it may have caused an argument from frustration or misunderstanding of the directions LOL so I would try to assemble yourself or tell yourself to be very patient with your \"helper\" who would be helping you assemble it lol.",

Ignore the people who said it took them anywhere over 2 hours to build this. I\u2019m currently 22 weeks pregnant and I put this whole thing together during my toddlers 2 hour nap. It\u2019s made of coated particle board which is my only disappointment but it is completely solid when put together properly.It came packaged compactly so there was absolutely no room for pieces to rub together and with lots of wrapping to protect the parts.When I opened the box I laid all the pieces that matched together. All the pieces labeled A with all the other A pieces. All the pieces labeled B with all the other B pieces. You get the point. A drill on a low torque setting will be your best friend in this too. They have a YouTube video you and can watch so if you get confused on which direction something goes. It will clear it up.You would literally have to have absolutely no skill at putting a screw or peg in a hole to need more than 2 hours to build this. That\u2019s the nicest way I can put that.",

                "reviewText": "Worst $230 I\u2019ve ever spent. I bought it for my 10 month old sons room. First of all, It took me almost an entire day to put it together. Yes I was taking breaks during assembly but that\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t simple enough for me to sit and put it together while taking care of my son all in one go. I only had it in his room 2 months before it fell apart. It almost fell apart pushing it on furniture sliders from the kitchen to his room the night I assembled it.We eventually decided it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle and purchased an already assembled dresser from a furniture store local to us. It continued to fall apart while we were moving it from his room to the garage.At first I planned to sell it for a cheap price, but then realized I couldn\u2019t sell it because it was literally falling apart. I\u2019ve said that several times now, but I just want to emphasize that. IT WAS FALLING APART.We decided to just put it out on our curb for bulk trash pick up to haul it away and eat the money. Well, as we were moving it from the garage to the curb, it literally crumbled to the ground. We were able to put it in TRASH BAGS. That\u2019s how many pieces this stupid thing was in. Mind you, we knew it was in bad shape so we put it on a dolly and wheeled it to the curb so it\u2019s not like we were dragging it, or even carrying it despite it being extremely light.I am so upset at this purchase. It was an expensive lesson learned to never buy furniture on Amazon. Not worth the hassle or the risk.",

A Camlock was broken, there was a spilt in the top we didn\u2019t see until we took it out of the box to put on, and the top drawer is uneven and does not open or close without force. I tried every single drawer and had the same issue. Which makes the top drawer unusable for my toddler. This looks to be a very sturdy nice dresser but the many issues make me regret spending so much on it for the quality.",

The finish has been easy to clean. Fits a change pad. Knobs easily removable. The white is not stark nor creamy - adapts well to any decor. Assembly was ok with 2 - took almost 3hours. Marginally better quality than IKEA dresser.",

                "reviewText": "My wife and I purchased this a few months ahead of our daughter being born (thankfully we did). This dresser arrived covered in black dirt or something along those lines. Once everything was cleaned I was ready to assemble the dresser only to get 3/4 of the way through and realize it was missing parts... The process of contacting the company to get the parts took nearly 3 weeks of back and fourth emails and pictures of the dresser with specific labels the company had stuck within the dresser drawers. Once we finally had the parts I was able to fully assemble it only to notice another issue... The dressers legs are 1/4 inch or so shorter on the front so it now leans forward becoming a tipping hazard. Overall this product is a complete joke and should not be market towards kids as it lacks basic safety standers (could tip onto your child if not bolted to the wall).",
