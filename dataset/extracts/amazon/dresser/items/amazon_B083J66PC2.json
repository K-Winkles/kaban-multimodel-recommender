This is the fourth dresser I have purchased from this seller. I have two of the double wide dressers and two of the tall ones. I love all of them. They fit right in with my other rustic brown and black furniture. Look, if you put these together the right way, they will be solid pieces of furniture that will last a long time. I'm a woman and I'm disabled and I put all of them together myself. It's so easy. Just follow the instructions and get all of the hardware organized and you need a small screw driver (not included) and not listed, but it's for the drawer pulls. It just makes it easier to get them tightened.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased - Color: White. After purchasing two others and having to return both for missing parts, bent parts, etc, finally found a winner with the Songmics product. Yes, it's a small storage cabinet - just as described, and what I was looking for. Yes, the drawers are made from fabric, just as described - the same type of materials as a storage cube. Don't expect it to hold a bowling ball! This is for clothing items. It is extremely easy to assemble, it is exactly as described in size and produce description; it took me less than 45 minutes to assemble two of these. Very intuitive to assemble. These cabinets will be used in the interior of a closet, to fit under clothing rack. They will not be used for heavy items. So happy that I went with this brand! I may change out the tiny knobs on each drawer and figure out a way to strengthen the back side of the pull front to add some support. These may cause a bit more, but are by far worth it.",

This dresser is exactly what I needed. lightweight and easy to assemble.The instructions were easy to follow, I did make one mistake though when I installed the middle stand for the drawers I had it backwards. but it was an easy fix, just 4 screws and flip. All screws and tools provided except a phillips screwdriver.The \"wood\" has a nice look. The metal frame is strong enough to hold a 40in tv(approx. 50 pds.) The cloth drawer has a hard bottom you install and can hold light stuff like socks and underwear. but I would not put anything heavy.The only downside I can see is that the sides are open and you can see the sides of the cloth drawer on both sides. It would be nice to have a couple \"wood\" sides to complete the full \"wood\" look.I am happy with the purchase an would buy similar again. But if you are looking for real wood or something to hold heavy object or in bulk, i would get something else.",

                "reviewText": "This is super super small. I am 5ft 5in and this comes up to about mid-thigh. The drawers are small, you can't fit much. If you are a very petit person or a child this would maybe work, or as toy storage. It was purchased for an adult who is 5ft 10in and slim, he can fit about 2 pairs of jeans in one drawer. I regret my purchase because I unfortunately didn't read the dimensions beforehand which is something I usually do, but I assumed it would be comparable to one I purchased before. You can get much larger fabric dressers for less or around the same price. I purchased a Sorbus one about a year ago for my room that is the same size as a regular dresser with deep drawers and it was around the same price as this. I am probably going to paint the drawer fronts and use it for my child and get a Sorbus one for the adult instead.",

It fits perfectly without taking up too much space, and the size is just right for the room. The design is a mix of wood and cloth drawers, which I wasn't sure about at first, but turns out, they're pretty sturdy and look decent too.The drawers themselves are more spacious than I expected. They hold all the extra stuff we have without any hassle. And the top of the dresser? It's solid enough to hold the TV, which is a big plus. I was a bit concerned about the weight, but it's been holding up just fine.Assembling it was a piece of cake. Didn't take too long, and the instructions were clear enough. It's not the kind of furniture that'll make you pull your hair out trying to put it together, which is always a relief.For anyone looking for a practical, no-fuss dresser for a smaller room or a spare bedroom, this SONGMICS dresser is a good pick. It does the job, looks pretty neat, and doesn't hit your wallet too hard. Plus, it's versatile enough to double as a TV stand, which is a nice bonus.",
