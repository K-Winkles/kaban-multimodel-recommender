It says that assembly takes 2 people and 2 hours. Initially I had tried to put one together and couldn\u2019t so I had to get help. The tracks were bent so the drawers don\u2019t slide out super even.The person was able to assemble one dresser in 1 hour and 8 minutes (he took the instructions as a challenge). Use a drill on this project for sure.The one looks good - no real issues. The second dresser though had damage to it and smelled horrible. Like when I say horrible I mean it funked up my whole house so bad I started a lupus flare bad. I cleaned it with an all purpose lavender cleaner and could only smell the funk. I put air fresheners in the drawers, still funk. Candles in all the draws, still funk. It was assembled two days ago and I still can\u2019t put clothes in it - I have to have it deodorized.Overall, if you want a cute inexpensive dresser this is a great choice but do be mindful that there may be issues - you do get what you pay for.",
