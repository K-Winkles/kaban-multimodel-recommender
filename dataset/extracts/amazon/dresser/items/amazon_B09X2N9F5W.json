The dresser is a cute stylish look buh it\u2019s not quite big on the inside such as the width of it but the length is a pretty good size. Nothing came broken or missing which was a win. The drawers slide pretty easy. Overall great product. It is time consuming but I ended up finishing it in a day even starting late afternoon. Highly recommend this instead of ikea. When you get to building the drawers I recommend to build all 6 before putting the tops on. Also the tools required were just a simple screwdriver.",

For one assembly is very long, lots of small pieces, instructions are just okay could have been more labeling as far as I\u2019m concerned. The worst part about the entire process is the dresser falling apart literally as I\u2019m building it. Turn a screw tight the wood would split and make it unable for me to use. I\u2019ve never had this happen to me assembling anything else. Quality just isn\u2019t there. Flipped the dresser over to continue assembling more pieces just break and fall off, do not purchase !!!",

                "reviewText": "The particle board for this is sooooo flakey. It's very poor quality. I bought a bed frame at the same price as this and the difference in quality was night and day. This was falling apart. You had to turn screws delicately or else the loose particle board would strip. Wood strips... it's normal. But this strips unlike anything I've ever seen.A drawer piece was cracked, for the same reason: the particle board is loosely compressed. I would say, the opposite of dense.Flakes of wood were everywhere after building. There was also a type of nail where paint flaked off (a silver spec, if you will) that we ended up spot painting (spec painting, I guess).You can just feel the lack of quality. But hey, it 100% will fit in small spaces and it LOOKS nice, at least.Just don't ever stand on it :)",
