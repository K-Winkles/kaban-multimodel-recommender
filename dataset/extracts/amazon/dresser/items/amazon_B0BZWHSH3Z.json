I was very skeptical and spend days trying to decide whether to get it and if is worth it.1st it was for my soon to be 13 year old son who has destroyed every type of dresser We have bought. we have bought the all grades of wood and we just gave up!. So if you are looking for a dresser for a teen room this is a must the draws are deep and hold a lot of clothing. Plus it thin so it doesn\u2019t take a lot of width space and the length is reasonable. We also bought the computer and night stand which is also amazing! It has deep pockets as well and hold alottt. .The Funiture at a whole is perfect for small rooms and teen proof because not only is affordable it doesn\u2019t take much space , gives the full furniture room look and Al of the products body is Metal the draws are cubicle which ha that depth that you need. This product made me question if all my Ashley Funiture was ever worth the money because it gives me all the usage I actually need.",

                "reviewText": "The cabinet is good, and seems well made for a cloth type drawer cabinet. The one recommendation I have is to put washers on the screws holding the handles to the drawers. I would recommend this even if the drawers were made of wood, but in particular when the drawer is a cloth/cardboard material. Over time, without the washers there would be a high probability the screws alone would pull through the material.",

It was a bit of a challenge to assemble -- the little screws were not easy to handle for someone with arthritis. But i persevered, and was very pleased with the results. The drawers are cloth covered cardboard, so I would not want to store anything heavy in them, but its great for tissues, t-paper, soap, etc.",
