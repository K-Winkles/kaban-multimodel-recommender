I got the 5 drawer one and the larger drawers can told a large backpack and tote. I put maybe 10 shirts in the smaller drawer and have room for more. Light weight (20lbs?) so it\u2019s easy to move around. Only complaint is that the drawers don\u2019t exactly fit into the space perfectly- there are some gaps.",

                "reviewText": "This little unit is exactly what I needed. I am staying at my daughter's home for a month, where I have my own room, but it has no storage space/furniture. I hate living out of a suitcase, so I ordered this item. It was very easy to assemble, (it took about 10 minutes), and it is exactly what I expected it to be. Now I can get a little more organized while I'm here, and my daughter can use it for future guests.ONE STAR DEDUCTED simply because of the price. While it is a useful product, the only reason I paid $65 plus tax (more than I think it is worth) is because I was somewhat desperate. After all, it's really only a few hollow metal tubes, a piece of particle board, and some cardboard wrapped in cheap fabric.I would say this item's main advantage is that it's a quick, simple fix for a space that needs storage. Having two different sizes of \"drawers\" is convenient. It would be good for anyone who needs something that:* looks nicer than a bunch of cardboard boxes or plastic totes* needs it quickly and temporarilyThe downside: I don't think this would last long in a room with heavy use, such as a child's room or kitchen. If it were less expensive, I wouldn't mind this aspect so much.",

I also thought it was a good deal for the price point. The ONLY sad part is that one of the tracks came dented which makes it hard for me to slide in one of the fabric drawers :( I would\u2019ve returned it as soon as I found the dent but by that time, I already assembled it and figured it\u2019s too much of a hassle.
