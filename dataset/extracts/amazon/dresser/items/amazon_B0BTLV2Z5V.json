Instructions were straight forward. Only took about an hour to assemble. My only complaint is the smell. It\u2019s strong but I\u2019m hoping it goes away after some time.",

I was able to fit a 32 inch tv and an Xbox on top of it. I would suggest to had a support bar to the top and into the wall in case you have children who climb stuff because it can easily tip with enough force. I will say it was worth $60 ish dollars and plan to purchase 2 more (I already bought 4). It can be assembled by one person but my children helped and it took maybe 25 minutes. I would suggest to use a small hand held drill if you have one to screw in the drawer handled but the Allen wrench has a Phillips head on the other end in case you don\u2019t have a drill.",

I have left the drawers sitting outside without the insert (to give the material drawers a bottom) and there is still a bad odor. I cannot explain it. Unless it is the plastic that is used in the material. Even Febreze hasn't helped. I purchased these drawers in october. It is now february. The drawer smell almost as bad as they did in the beginning. I have had them in an unused room, drawers open, hasn't helped! If I can give this product a zero I would.",
