Here are my overall likes/dislikes: ~ It shipped with USPS, so they could not deliver it b/c it was oversized. So, by the time I got it in, the box was completely torn and I struggled to hold the box together and put it in my car. Once we got it home and unpacked it, we began putting it together. ~ It was very easy to assemble. My son (11) and I put one together and then he and his sister (7) put the second one together. ~ The frame of it is very sturdy yet it is still light ( it only took one person to carry it up the stairs assembled. ~ The drawers were a nice wooden-looking fabric. They are the fabric drawers so I was concerned with their sturdiness. the lining at the bottom is thicker than most of the fabric collapsable totes you get. ~ It has actual drawer pulls instead of just a fabric handle. ~ TWO parts of the frame were bent. They were fairly easy to bend back; however, they did not fully go back in place. This made assembly a bit more difficult (however not difficult enough to warrant a 4 for assembly).Overall, my only wish is that it wasn't shipped by USPS so that it could have actually been brought to my door. For the price you pay, you can not beat it. It looks very nice while still being affordable. It Does NOT look cheap by any means. I purchased two (one for each of my sons) and I will be buying another one for my daughter.",

                "reviewText": "I assembled this dresser after assembling the matching nightstands. First thing to know is the box is heavy. I could not bring it into the house myself. Also, because the dresser is taller and wider than the nightstands, assembly of the base of the dresser is a two-person job in my experience.The pieces are labeled, and the step-by-step instructions are easy to follow. The x-bar in the back of the dresser adds to its sturdiness. When finished, it looks great. Fits my space and storage needs. I'm very happy with the price point and purchase.",

According to the description it was supposed to fit the closet but it was a bit difficult to actually get it it (this was my fault) overall the structure feels sturdy but the drawers are made of fabric and won\u2019t hold much weight. They do come with some support that helps a lot. The front is not made of wood but a type of veneer and scratches extremely easily. The top part is made from engineered wood and feels \u201csolid\u201d the overall look is good and serves its purpose but for the price it\u2019s on the \u201chigh end\u201d this would be great to put toys. Will update if anything changes",

The drawers are fabric, but the insertable hard bottom sheet really stabilizes them. The frame has little tabs that keep the drawers in place and stops them slipping out the back. For being fabric, the print is nice looking, and matches with most of my furniture (rustic brown). The shelving unit is durable, between placement of wood boards, metal frame, and metal cross members.",
