I read the instructions which were not that difficult to follow actually and I am not one that buys stuff and puts it together. I will pay the extra money for someone else to do it. It took me the better part of 1 evening but I did it and I love it! You definitely need to have a mallet or hammer to tighten everything up which I did and it looks great! Just like the picture. I just now purchased the night stand that matches it. It truly wasn\u2019t that difficult but for me it was time consuming because I do not build things, ever! I love how it looks, it works great and it is exactly as I had hoped.",

Sadly, after 30 minutes of trying to get it together , with a hammer as they suggested, the pieces just were not going to join up together. I worked so hard on it I was sweating . I was only 4 diagrams into it and nothing I did would work. I have put together so many pieces of furniture over decades, but this one just didn't work. I packed it up, and immediately took it to the UPS store to return it. The return was very easy, and the refund was done within minutes. So, now I'm still on the hunt.",

Doesn't lay flush against the dresser. I gave it 2 stars because of the patterns on the front of the inserts. Way overpriced for the product. Also the top of dresser is simply a piece of cardboard that has fabric over it and it doesn't lay flush on the top. You've been warned",
