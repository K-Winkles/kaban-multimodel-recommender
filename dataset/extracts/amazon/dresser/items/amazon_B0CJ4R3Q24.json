                "reviewText": "I bought this dresser to go inside my daughter\u2019s closet. The height is just a couple inches higher than a standard nightstand so it was perfect to add extra storage without having to move the hanging rod. Assembly took me close to two hours but it was very easy, instructions were clear and parts were labeled well. A few parts were cracked or bent but the imperfections weren\u2019t prohibitive. I did have to glue one stripped drawer handle. The drawer bottoms are very thin but there is a center brace to provide extra support and they move smoothly. It looks just as pictured and I\u2019m very happy with the purchase!",

                "reviewText": "Good: it is sturdy feeling, solid and the drawer also feels good. The color is consistent and the appearance is exactly as shown in the images.Not so good: The main thing for me is the height. The stand is in a guest room and it's too short next to a modern mattress and foundation. I think if you have a platform with no foundation under the mattress it would work better but for this use, it needs to be about 6\" taller. I saw the dimensions when I ordered it so can't complain about that too much.The stand did have damage when it showed up, just some peeling of the veneer on the drawer. It resulted in a hassle because I didn't notice it until it was basically fully assembled, but I would need tj take it apart to ship it back.",
