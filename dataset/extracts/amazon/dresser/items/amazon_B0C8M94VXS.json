                "reviewText": "Anything this bog and complex, assembly is what it is. Took probably 2 hours to get everything assembled, then figure out which drawer goes into which hole. I can hear your condescending remark now, \"the big ones go in the big holes, the small ones in the small holes.\" Yeah, except they don't just fit into any of the holes. We literally had to try each drawer in their corresponding size hole to figure out which one it \"fit\" in and closed all the way. Somehow the front of the drawer on some were slightly over compared to the others of the same size. So they all fit in only one way. That might be what some few others mentioned about not being able to close drawers all the way. Another thing about the drawers, and this is partially my fault for not understanding the measurements better, they are SUPER shallow. I can only fit about 4 shirts stacked into the drawers. The front of the drawer makes it look plenty big for your clothes, but the drawer itself is only a small fraction of the size of the front cover.The quality feels OK. Like if we don't abuse it, it'll prob last many years, but I kinda don't want it to. It's way too big and complicated so I really don't want to take it back apart to return. Technically it'll work fine for us. I recently got rid of a ton of clothes and bought new, so I don't have an overabundance of clothes that don't all fit in it. The jacks on the top are a nice feature, although I wouldn't probably use it if not for the \"riser\" stand I have that covers the outlets so the cables aren't just hanging out noticeable. I have my PS4 under it and plugged into the outlet and it looks nice. And it does look nice. The whole design is really nice to look at. The added \"box thing\" on the side is a unique concept and very useful.Overall it's OK. I'm just disappointed at the lack of storage space for such a big dresser. So much wasted space in it.",
