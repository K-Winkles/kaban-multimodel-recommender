I put it together my self and it was pretty easy and they provide to with what you need to do it. For being a thin metal frame it\u2019s pretty sturdy and the cloth boxes are nicely made as well. I think it will last me a while. It\u2019s small for how big it is and it doesn\u2019t take up very much space in her room. In fact swapping out her old broken dresser for this one gave her a little more play space. I\u2019m definitely happy with my purchase.",
