The front is NOT fabric as the ad states , it's wood laminate and is so much stronger and nicer looking. Really happy with it the original cost me about $100, this one only $47, a steal and we'll worth it. It also has hardware to bolt to the wall If needed. it looks much more expensive then it was. excellent value",

JUST MAKE SURE YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE DIRECTION OF THE DRAWER BACK TABS. Was skeptical about size and also the fabric drawers but very satisfied now. The drawers are very sturdy, they arent like the fabric cubical ones you can buy. They are a lot more rigid. Ill probably buy a couple more varieties to complete our project.",

It\u2019s actually pretty nice and I will likely buy more matching pieces in the future.",
