But please buy it if you or your partner or someone you know knows how to properly assemble things together. My partner spent over an hour and half assembling it together and he followed the steps and assembled the dresser from the inside out as directed. There are alot of pieces and may be overwhelming, but that\u2019s why you need to take your time on it. It is very sturdy and heavy and one thing i do like about the dresser is that you can\u2019t open another drawer if one is already opened and you need to use both hands to open the drawer so it\u2019s definitely heavy and would be hard for a kid to pull on the drawers or tip over. So far i like it and i hope i will continue to like it.",
