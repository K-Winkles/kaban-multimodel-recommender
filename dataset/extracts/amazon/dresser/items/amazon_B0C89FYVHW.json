                "reviewText": "Mine came in a very neatly organized and clean packing and all the parts were perfectly constructed. The directions were very good although perfect but if you have common sense than this will be a breeze build! If you pay attention to certain details of your build you will actually build a perfectly good dresser that looks proper and performs perfectly. I honestly look at some reviews and know that they put it together wrong not that the product was faulty, which is frustrating to see. But some people really don't have any common sense. Some I reckon did have damage issues which is obviously a reasonable complaint so im not speaking about those reviews. ALSO, this was some of my concerns initially about buying it. Do the drawers slide in and out smoothly and do they clash with eachother? Happy to say that if you build it properly you will have smooth drawers in and out and zero clashing with eachother. Also ALL of the drawers come with hard bottom inserts that keep the bins from folding in and being clunky while providing strong support for your drawers as well. I saw a review about them folding all over the place and thought to myself, did she not realize there are inserts that prevent that from happening!? Guess not!If you have concerns about how the dresser performs and if it's annoying to access, dont even worry about it cuz no issues at all if built properly. Lastly, the build itself was very easy and only took me about 20 minutes and I took my time perfecting the details. There is a little wiggle room around the Bolts so make sure to line all your brackets up evenly so you don't have 1 all the way forward and 1 all the way back. Line them all up than tighten them down as centered as possible. That is a key tip to having a smooth dresser. Oh and it's a bit shorter than I realized but really provides great storage and looks very clean and nice. This is a phenomenal deal for $40 and im very happy I didn't go traditional wood dresser for 5 times the cost. I bought another one in different style and twice as big from the same company cuz I was very impressed with how organized and easy they made it to put together.",

It comes up to my knee and I'm only 5'4, so. You could stack three of these on top of each other and maybe hit the height of a regular short dresser. But even then you'd have the skinniest short dresser ever made. Possibly if you ball up a pair of underwear, you can put it in the drawer. Maybe I accidentally bought the American Girl doll dresser, idk. I would send it back if I didn't have to take it apart but I'm too lazy. And too amused at figuring out what I'm going to do with this miniature version of a dresser. That said it was easy to assemble and seems sturdy enough - for hobbit furniture.",
