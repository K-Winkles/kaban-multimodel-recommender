It was easy to put together, but I did need 2 of the back up pieces (they send an extra of every screw, etc so it was great to have them on hand). The wooden top makes this a great product. Drawers are as expected, hard pop up with a reinforced bottom. I compared a lot of similar items, glad I picked this.",

Nice dresser to have clothes storage and some space to display. Happy I decided on this one",

Also, the product came with a terrible odor, it really smells like trash due to the material use on the drawers. Contacted customer services, sent pictures of the issues as they ordered the parts and gave me some tips on getting rid of the smell. Even do we tried with almost every product on the market and left the drawers out during the night, the smell never left. Contacted customer service again and they sent me a new one. For what you pay, its decent size and sturdy, drawers are ok. Very happy with the purchase overall and glad this vendor takes customer satisfaction seriously. It\u2019s a good low budget alternative and the design is nice and you get 8 small size drawers. Looks good. Definitively, I will buy from this seller again, they were very responsible.",

The instructions were very clear with pictures to make sure you put it together in the correct way. One really nice thing was that it came with extra hardware. Due to it's size and me putting it on carpet, it's not the sturdiest (not a negative - just a placement thing) but I'm not concerned about tipping over or anything like that. Footprint is not very large but it has a decent amount of surface area and drawer space. One thing to consider when deciding on placement....if you plan to have an outlet directly behind the unit then you will not be able to place it flush up against the wall without having one of the drawers sticking out a little. Not a major thing as you only need to put it a couple inches from the wall. Just a point to consider when deciding on location.",

                "reviewText": "This dresser is perfect for a small room that can't accommodate a full-sized dresser comfortably. With a 12-inch depth, it has a very narrow footprint, yet it is sturdy and doesn't look very small. I love the tiered shelf design, adds a little fun to the dresser and the space. The charging station on top is a cool little extra as well.If you plan to put a TV on top of this dresser, the shelf will only accommodate a 32\" TV. I opted to mount a larger TV above the dresser instead, and it looks nice. I don't know how long the fabric drawers will last, but they look nice and are fairly sturdy. It's a good value for the price, and it doesn't look cheap.",

The 52'' length provides ample storage space, and the addition of the charging station is a convenient feature that I appreciate.However, I must note that the dresser is not as sturdy as I would have wanted. While it's not a deal-breaker, it's worth mentioning. The assembly process was straightforward, and the dresser looks aesthetically pleasing in my bedroom. The charging station is a thoughtful touch, keeping my devices organized and ready to go.Despite the slight concern about sturdiness, the dresser still meets most of my expectations. The design is attractive, the storage capacity is practical, and the charging station adds a modern and functional element. It's a near-perfect fit for my bedroom, providing both style and utility.",
