                "reviewText": "I wanted a nice nightstand to my guestroom. This one was perfect as they have the option \"2 in 1 package\" so I could get the same nightstand to both side of the bed.The shipping was quick and it was really easy to assembly (the instructions are clear and everything is labeled properly). My only issue was that I was missing 1 pair item (a piece from the bottom that connects the legs). Even with that, I could fully built 1 nightstand or built both but you need to be mindful when you use the drawer as it is not completely stable. I contacted the company and requested the items being replaced/shipped. As it is such a small item that the shipping would cost more, they offered me a half refund - basically I can buy another nightstand!So 5* it is as the customer service is great, the product is neat (size is great, material is good, easy to assembly and looks pretty) and it's perfect addition to our guestroom!",
