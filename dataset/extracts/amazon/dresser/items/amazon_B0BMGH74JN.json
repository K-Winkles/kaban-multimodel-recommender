Some other reviews mentioned..1. the instructions being too long2. parts missing3. unstable when builtThe instructions were long but detailed. It was really easy to follow tbh. The only reasons I can see them being bad is if you have bad eyesight and aren\u2019t that bright of a person lol.I didn\u2019t have a single missing screw but I also kept an eye out for all the pieces. Everything I needed was included, including a screwdriver and a few extra screws just in case.I mean it\u2019s sturdy enough for the price. Especially if you follow the directions. You can definitely add more optional screws in some places to secure it better but it doesn\u2019t teeter nor does it instantly collapse like some other reviewers wrote.I\u2019m an 18 yr old girl and It took me about 3 hours to build it on my own. I was watching tv so it could possibly take 2 people an hour at most from start to finish with no distractions.It is also pretty spacious enough for what I needed it for. It looks exactly like the image.Maybe I\u2019ll come back and add pictures. Overall pretty good for price. I love it.",

                "reviewText": "The dresser is very nice. I am quite pleased with it. I needed something that was between 27-28 inches wide and 36-38 inches high and this was the only product I could find to those dimensions.I bought 3 of these units to fill the space exactly as I wanted and it did the job excellently.The finishing of the product is also excellent.Let me now turn towards a couple of issues that others may want to be aware of.Assembly of these units is as complicated as a typical Ikea piece of furniture. So it does take quite a bit of an effort to assemble it. The brochure says that it is supposed to take 60 minutes, but that would need superhuman energy or an expert to do it. Between myself and my daughter, it took an average of 3 hours to assemble each one, i.e. a total of probably 9 hours to do all three.The good part was that the assembly instructions are excellent and every part (inculding hardware) is labeled and shown in the instruction sheet too. Little chance of making a mistake.The second issue relates to the wood used for the drawers (not the structure). The drawers are made of rather soft wood, and I hope that these last. The issue I had at time of assembly was that I was using my drill screwdriver to make my life easier. I soon discovered that since the wood is very soft, it drives the screws into the wood when I used the powered screwdriver. So if you plan to use any powered screwdriver, please make sure you use it on low power otherwise you will break the wood or make the holes too large and it wont work. Or, you could use the manual screw driver which is provided with the kit and that way you will not damage the soft wood.Another small issue is that the metal slides attached to the drawers are fixed. You have to use a screw to fix the drawers to the slides. Once this is fixed, you cannot remove the drawers from the unit unless you remove the screws. That can be a bit of a pain. And what I am worried about is that over time, if I were to remove and reassemble the drawer screws a few times, the drawers may fall apart because of the soft wood.The base of the drawers used a good quality plywood. So I expect that these will not sag. I did like the extra support at the bottom of the larger drawers to ensure that the base will not sag in the middle.All hardware used is very similar to Ikea and quite good. The wall bracket in the back for security is also excellent. Very sturdy.I just might add that even though it took time to assemble, it was not physically exhausting. Maybe it was because I used the drill screwdriver and did not have to exert as much. Or because the parts were not huge that required too much effort to lift.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these. Didn\u2019t love paying $80 for shipping, but they got here in good condition and much faster than expected. Quality is better than I anticipated, and let's be honest, your expectations of a $99 dresser should be directly associated with the price you paid. My husband put them together in about 3.5 hours and said he was impressed. (He's got lots of experience assembling things I buy!) No issues and only one or two curse words were uttered in the process (from him, not me). We bolted them back to back using the wall brackets they came with (that took both of us to do). I am very pleased with the outcome. Nice quality, perfect size and looks like a custom piece arranged this way!! Lots of storage for both of us.",

I have never used such lightweight hardware. the screws etc are one-use. if you have to back it out, you may as well throw it away.finally, one key piece of one of the drawers was broken. hard to say whether it was poorly packaged or just a crummy piece of wood. glued together, it may actually hold up. fingers crossed.short story, these folks need to do a lot more work on their product.DO NOT BUY!!!!!",

Found this, ordered it, opened the box and found that the quality of the parts were the BEST I had seen in a LONG time, like over 20 years long! The final product is sturdy, useful, and I couldn't be happier!! Best value for the money and due to the quality of the materials used to make this, I am SURE this will last me a very long time!
