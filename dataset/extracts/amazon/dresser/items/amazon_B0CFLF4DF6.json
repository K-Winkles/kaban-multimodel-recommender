The step I was on in the instructions was difficult because I didn\u2019t have one of the pieces necessary for the drawer to be able to slide in and out. I had to right pieces instead of one left and one right. Other than that there weren\u2019t any issues really. Please be more careful when packing up the things in the box thank you.",
