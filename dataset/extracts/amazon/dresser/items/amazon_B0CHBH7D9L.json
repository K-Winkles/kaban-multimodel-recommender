But I wanted the dresser bad enough that I felt the need to be the first one to experience it, first of all my package got lost in the mail and got delivered to the wrong place and customer service was spectacular with that and sent out a new one right away and when I got it I was a little intimidated by all of the pieces. But let me tell you you could not mess up building this dresser, everything goes in one spot and one spot only and the instructions are pretty easy to read and the dresser is actually way higher quality than I thought it was going to be. There's so many supports for the drawers and it just looks good. A lot more room in it than I expected. I would definitely purchase from this company again!",

                "reviewText": "These took forever to put together, so be ready for that! But the directions were relatively clear, and the end result is beautiful! I changed from a more traditional dresser and these two have a lower profile while providing a lot more storage! I love them! I especially like the little top drawer area. I bought some Puck lights here on Amazon and stuff them to the top of the inside. You can still open the top part and it doesn't knock them off. Makes for a really pretty presentation.",

Seller wouldn\u2019t refund unless it was shipped back which would cost so much more and involves disassembly and loading a heavy dresser. DONT BUY.",

And the final look is absolutely beautiful. 10/10 - I\u2019ve ordered a few things from this seller, so I\u2019m beyond excited to finish putting everything together. Excellent quality and highly recommend.",
