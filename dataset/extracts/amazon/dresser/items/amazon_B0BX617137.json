It went together easily using the provided instructions and listed dimensions are accurate. That said, I would not consider the drawers sturdy. They do a good job of holding toddler clothes (that are accessed primarily by an adult and not the toddler) but I don't expect they would be suitable for too much more than that. I hope to find out that I am wrong about that!",
