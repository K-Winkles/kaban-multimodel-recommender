It\u2019s very sturdy. It\u2019s big but was easy to move from one place to the next after assembling. This is very sturdy and firm.",

                "reviewText": "This is one step below solid wood (so plywood). For the price it's a great deal but be prepared for some frustration and 4 hours of assembly (this is my second one to assemble in a week and I am handy). Also give yourself a two week runway. Opened the day I got it and packaging looked solid. All the way in the middle were 6 cracked drawer sides. 3 to 5 business days to process and ship replacements (and that's calling during 8 to 5 business hours) and no expedited shipping so another 5 days to ship coast to coast. At least they were free....dent in the bottom wood....no one will notice, but I will....also have a baby room to ready so couldn't wait a week for that piece, only for half the drawers! Parenting priorities. Once done it was nice and seems rather sturdy. Process was far from desirable. Let's hope it survives the kids growing up.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this and a matching crib. The quality is about commensurate to the price.It took two hours to assemble and I am pretty handy.The real issue is that the drawers are absurdly shallow and they don't even open out all of the way. Based upon the depth of the dresser, the drawers could have been easily three inches deeper. I would have never bought this had I known. Considering the relatively large size of the dresser and the enormous effort it takes to put it together, and the tiny, shallow drawers that barely open, it is just not worth having.As I write this I am contemplating whether to keep it, try to disassemble it and return it, or just give it away and write off the $300.Stacking six plastic boxes would be a better solution than this dresser.",

Overall it looks great, but the drawers don't come out all the way and are quite small which makes it difficult to get things into the back of the drawer and organize it the way you want. I would suggest investing in a \"normal\" sized dresser right off the bat so that it can grow with the child and their clothes!",

As per the photos attached, the screw went in and cracked the piece of wood. The other issue was a hole that wasn't pre-drilled correctly. Had to modify the hole so the screw would go through to connect with the metal piece at the opposite end.",
