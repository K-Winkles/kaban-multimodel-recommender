The drawers slide in and out easily. The printing on the front was a surprise, but its cool. I use it for organizing crafts, junk drawer, important papers and a router stand/ Alexa pedestal in the living room. I feel i got way more than my moneys worth!!

The unit is very lightweight and easy to move around once assembled. The drawers slide in and out with ease and it has a clean look. I was amazed at how much I was able to load into each drawer. I\u2019m not sure it would withstand daily use the way I have it loaded, but if it was full of lightweight items like socks, undies, and t-shirts it would.",

It took less than 10 min to assemble, it fits perfectly in her closet and it has a nice sturdy top to it. I was worried it would be flimsy or look cheap (which is why we planned on putting it in the closet) but it doesn't at all. The drawers (bins) are much bigger than expected and if we ever needed to use it in her room, it would look like a regular dresser.. so, for the price it was definitely a good purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted something taller than a normal nightstand to go next to my bed since it's a taller bed. This was the perfect height and the extra drawers come in handy. It looks very nice when put together even though the drawers are material and not wood but they are pretty sturdy. The top is probably compressed wood but looks nice. I would definitely recommend. I ended up buying 2 more in different colors since this particular color sold out for a bit.",
