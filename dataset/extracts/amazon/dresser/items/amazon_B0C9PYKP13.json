                "reviewText": "I'm happy with it so far, basically a light metal frame that holds cloth bound drawers. It took me about 2.5 hours to put together, (stopping every 20 minutes to go check on dinner and stir a pot), and taking my time. No tools necessary, it comes with an allen wrench/screwdriver that works fine. However, if you have a regular allen wrench and small Phillips head screwdriver, you will have an easier time.The drawers as you can imagine are lightweight, and if you put something like blue jeans in them (adult size) they will push out a little, but for lighter cloths it doesn't distort.It seems stable enough, though it does come with parts to attach it to the wall if you feel like it needs it (kids etc.) Can put light stuff on top, lamp, clock, decorations, things like that, but I wouldn't want to put anything with any real weight to it on there, like a TV or stereo etc. (might work depending on weight, but i'd definitely secure the unit to the wall at that point just to be safe.)Can definitely recommend if you need some extra storage, and I would buy again.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Easy assembly, good capacity with minimal footprint, unexpected draw for cats",
                "reviewText": "This was extremely easy to assemble. I love that the drawers are light and foldable so it is easy to prepare for moving when needed. I like the clean, minimalist look and it allows better clothing organization than the much bulkier IKEA Malm that I've replaced with this. I love the adjustable feet so you can account for any lean in your floor. Ignore the TV showing in my photo... they have a very strong warning to not do that so I'm not following the rule. If I had children in the house, I wouldn't.The one drawback that I did not factor in: cats LOVE climbing fabric and they really like boxes. I have caught one cat constantly climbing up the side instead of just jumping to the top (apparently climbing is more fun). Also, because there is a gap between each level of drawers, the cats can see there is a box just sitting there asking to be crawled into. I routinely walk into my bedroom to see bottom drawers hanging open or am woken in the middle of the night to obsessive pawing of my cat trying to open the drawer to get in it. They've never done that with my wooden dressers so will see how this holds up to the abuse. I find it amusing but wouldn't recommend for households that have cats and easily angered humans.All in all I think this and the matching versions are great buys for small spaces, for people who need light, movable furniture, and those who just like clean lines and minimal bulk.",

I can\u2019t believe the amount of clothes I put in this thing. Couple of screws into the wall and adjust the front legs so it tucks against the wall nicely. No worries. 100% I would purchase this again. For the price an outstanding product",

It was easy to assemble as everyone shared but the FISHY SMELL WILL NOT GO AWAY. I received item on 12/28/23 and assembled the same day, immediately I got an unpleasant odor from the materials but I thought it was due to it being boxed too long and maybe it would go away in a day. It did not go away. I sprayed it with everything I could think of, I took it outside to air out under the sun (left it out 4 days) but the smell remained. I\u2019m disappointed I had to write this review because of it wasn\u2019t for the HORRIBLE SMELL I would have giving this item 5 stars.",
