                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the WLIVE Fabric Dresser for my bedroom, and I must say, it's been a delightful addition. The dresser's white color and clean design add a touch of modern elegance to my room. With six drawers, it offers ample storage space, making it perfect for organizing clothes, accessories, and miscellaneous items.The fabric bins are surprisingly sturdy and slide in and out smoothly. They are also quite spacious, and their fabric design adds a cozy touch that would blend well with a variety of decor styles. This dresser isn't just limited to bedroom use; its versatile design makes it suitable for the living room, hallway, or even in a closet for extra organization.Assembly was relatively straightforward. The instructions were clear, and I was able to put it together by myself in about an hour. The frame feels stable and durable, though it's lightweight enough to move around if needed.My only minor gripe is that the fabric bins, while quite durable, don't have the same rigidity as wooden drawers. But considering the affordability and design of the product, this is a small concession.Overall, the WLIVE Fabric Dresser is a great purchase for anyone looking for a stylish, functional, and affordable storage solution. It's helped me keep my space organized and looking great!\"",

I did have to take a few pieces of apart and reassemble because it's hard to figure the front and the back of the dresser. Once I determined everything, it went together nicely.The drawers are roomy, easy to assemble and sturdy.I got the gray. The drawers are gray, the frame is white, the handles are white and the top is a beige linoleum. I would have preferred the top to be gray or white, although it is not obnoxious. I can live with it for the quality, value and the ease of assembly. The drawers are fabric but very sturdy. Also are easy to slide in and out. We used it in a small guest room for short-term stays it's perfect or a child's bedroom. Also a great little storage cabinet for an attic or closet.",

                "reviewText": "Much better quality than excepted for such a low price. Dresser is small, best suited for one person. Very light weight.Assembly is fairly quick and easy. If you have ever purchased similar types of furniture on Amazon, this should be extremely simple for you. Does take a hot minute to get things together, approx 40 minutes. The screwdriver part of the Alan wrench is terrible, use your own Phillips head screwdriver for attaching the handles to the dresser.The piece is actually pretty sturdy for the design. Once everything is set up and tightened, it doesn't wobble or anything. Better quality than excepted for sure. Same with the drawers, much more stable and thick than excepted.All in all a good piece of furniture for the price. As long as your expectations are realistic you'll be happy with this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this mini dresser after donating a heavy, solid wood bedroom suite of furniture to make my bedroom feel more spacious. The price caused me hesitation, as I thought it might look too cheaply made. I am so glad I decided to try it! Ble to assemble in a short amount of time with no frustration. Top is a wood based material and drawer fronts are matching wood look fabric. Yes...fabric! Very light, yet sturdy, and even comes with the attachment part for the wall if you have small children to keep it from falling on them. Metal frame is light, but plenty sturdy. Drawers are very deep - can easily hold at least 4 bulky sweaters per drawer. I would think it would be the perfect purchase for student apartments, anyone living in a small apartment or home, guestroom, or even to add drawer space in a closet. Don't let the price hold you back from seeing what a terrific, useful little dresser this is!",

I thought crates would do it but they are astronomical $. This fit right in the closet no problem. Quick put together Can be done by one but more fun with 2. It has the option to secure to the wall but hubby said no way Its a good value for the $",

We set it up last night.The only complaint so far is that the package we received was obviously a return. Thankfully, all parts were included.It\u2019s a good size for a smaller bedroom, and it isn\u2019t too tall, so he\u2019ll easily be able to reach the top. My stepson has a very small wardrobe, and I suspect we\u2019ll need to get something a bit bigger when he\u2019s older.Quality-wise, it feels sturdy without being too heavy. The drawers slide easily. The material of the drawers is a sturdy canvas, and it has the appearance of real wood without the cost/weight. I am happy with how it looks.I would recommend this dresser for a relatively inexpensive but nice-looking and functional solution for a smaller bedroom and child.",
