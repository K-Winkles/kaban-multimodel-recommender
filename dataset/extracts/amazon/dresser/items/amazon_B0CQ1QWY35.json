Because I had read that this is ideal for a dorm room, small apartment, etc. decided to see if this was the piece to buy. The other reviews and videos were very complementary and so on those reviews based my decision.I was (and am now) pleased with this purchase. The size was perfect for the space needed. The package arrived quickly, no dents in box etc. All the pieces were there, including extra screws and also supplied everything needed to put together.The instructions are very clear and easy to follow, including labeling each item and the various bolts, screws, etc. were also labeled, matched the booklet, and easy to follow also. In order to cut time, I decided to put the handles on all the storage drawers first and one thing that is clear, these are not flimsy at all. They are sturdy, well made, and easy to attach the handles on eight drawers, made of sturdy cloth but more than that heavier material but not too heavy. The insert that gives the drawers support is very strong and be sure to notice the tab in each insert as when you want to move, this tab lifts the bottom up and then the drawer folds down with the bottom piece tucked inside for spacing when moving.Next built the unit according to the booklet and also used the drawings to be sure I was following correctly. Be sure to have the base and middle sections face each other as the booklet states as the baskets need to fit inside their slots. Also be sure to notice that the two metal thin pieces (2) are attached to the back correctly as there are 3 screws for this piece that joins each side of the frame and then both meet in the middle in the back. Once that part is done then the top, real wood too, is the last to go on. I flipped the top upside down, then the frame upside down and easier to attach the top to the frame.Once done, I sent a picture to my friend and she loves the coloring, the look in the space and liked it very much. Overall, at 74 no problem putting it together and if I can so can anyone. I recommend this product and very satisfied that i made the purchase. It is sturdy and I could carry it to the spot I had in mind. That makes is even better when moving or re-arranging the room. They do include some extra support if you want to attach the back to the wall (in case floor is not level or carpeting?), so it will not top over.For the price, quality, easy to assemble, and fast shipping are all pluses to consider. It's a winner!",

The only negative is that they have a strange smell, like chemicals or something. You only notice it when you open the drawers, but if you are sensitive I might suggest different drawers.I am very pleased though and may get more of these drawers in the future.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly they give you way more tools than you necessarily need, lol.Use the 6 long black ones to put the metal frame together.You have to use the tool they give you to tighten them up. Once you find a good position to screw the bolts in, it's not too bad. Pretty easy to put together once you figure out which tools ur supose to use.The multiple little black ones, use them to attach the wood to the frame. I suggest hand screwing the bolts before trying to use the tool, other wise you will cross thread, and have to remove the whole bolt to do it again.The 2 metal bars that are to be attached to the 3 frames, the holes to screw them in are on the tips. Pay attention to where the holes are on ur bars , makes it alot easier to put together.The tiny! Silver bolts are for the drawers, not terribly hard just make sure to use the tool provided. Other tools from home don't apply the same! I tried.Over all its a decent little dressed, the drawers are not wood by the way, all cloth. The only part that's wood is the very top. Also be sure to look over youre pieces. Some of mine came in bent, but they were still useful, could still put it together no problem. You want something cheap and durable for the time being , thus is the one for you. Also makes a fantastic temporary TV stand. Lol.",
