The main center rod was missing the second whole which would have made the dresser more sturdy. The circle nail holders are so loose they kept and keep popping out when I move the dresser. There are multiple scratches and stains as well. I tried to contact the company because I wanted at least a partial of credit due to the broken and missing pieces, however, the only options they provided were a replacement or a return. Both require me to break it down to send it back. I don't really post reviews but thought I should warn people that if you want something will last and be worth the money do NOT buy this product.",

Step 1 if you don't see the lever give it a bit of a tug. Step 2 there is a mess up you will need A and C to attach the support bars, parts and holes match A and C, direction show A and A. Not all part were labeled for the drawer sides match the lines and big holes. Have photos of the A and C spot. About half of the B part holes are slightly too big so they will wiggle loose and unscrew them self, video shows the looseness I am gluing them in place. This piece will work for light use needs but not advised for daily use things like clothing. All 3 of mine had the same issues thru our. Took so long out together. They are pretty and I am storing craft supplies in them but be advised they will be a head ache to put together and keep together.",

I was nervous since there weren\u2019t any reviews for the 6 drawer one, so I was really crossing my fingers that it\u2019d be good. I got them delivered, and assembled the first one within 2.5 hrs by myself and the second one took me 2 hrs. I don\u2019t have experience building furniture at all, but the instructions were clear enough. I built both of them without any issues! Just time consuming, but what do you expect for this price? To my surprise, all the drawers were lined up, nothing was dinged, and it works as intended! Also have to note that I\u2019m always weary about buying furniture online, because shipping causes damage. NOTHING was even slightly damaged or dinged, so I really applaud the packaging. I will say it\u2019s on the smaller side compared to standard dressers \u2014 the drawers are on the shallow side. It fit my needs though, so that\u2019s fine for me! Overall, I\u2019m satisfied with the product. It met my expectations, and it provides the storage I need.",
