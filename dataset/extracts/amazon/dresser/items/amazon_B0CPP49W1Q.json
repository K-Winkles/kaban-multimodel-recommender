A: Assembly is straightforward, but there are quite a few pieces which makes it SEEM more daunting. The six drawer boxes need to be assembled. You will need flat head and Phillips head screwdrivers and a hammer. And two will make it go faster!

                "reviewText": "Now that I\u2019ve finally put the dresser together by myself (it took me about 5 hours and the manufacturer suggests having two people do it), I can comment on the assembly process. Note that I didn\u2019t have power tools. The instructions were actually very good with very clear concise drawings. And I never had an issue where maybe a hole was drilled in one place when it should\u2019ve been drilled in a different place and it affected the assembly, or pieces were out of alignment or something. So the manufacturing of the parts was well done for the most part.As I mentioned, it took quite a while to do this myself. Power tools would\u2019ve sped things up, however since the wood is a sort of particle board, power tools can have a tendency to over torque screws and rip and crack particle board, so I\u2019d maybe advise against it. No real cons to be honest. A couple of strange design choices by the manufacturer though. One of them was they augured strips of lines into a couple of the backboards of the dresser, however these augured lines are never seen because the boards that they\u2019re on face inward towards the middle of the dresser and so are hidden. Not even when you open the drawers do you see them. And so they served no purpose. Idk just seemed weird and pointless to me. There was another instance where holes were drilled on a board but they were never used. I know this might sound like I read the instructions wrong, however in both the drawings and the description they never use the holes for anything. Ultimately you never see them as again they\u2019re facing inward towards the middle of the dresser. Anyway, in spite of the augured strips in the wood and holes that serve no purpose, the dresser looks very nice all the way around. The pieces were packaged very well too with lots of padding. I actually had about a 6 inch gash on the packaging box that dug in about half an inch deep, however it never touched any of the pieces of the dresser because they were packaged so well with lots of styrofoam. I actually ended up buying two of these dressers, however have only put one together so far. If there are any cons with the second dresser as I start putting it together I\u2019ll update this review. But overall I highly recommend!",
