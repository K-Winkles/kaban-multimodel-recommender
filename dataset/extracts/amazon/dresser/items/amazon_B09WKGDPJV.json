                "reviewText": "My concern about these types of cabinets is whether the drawers are really going to fit well as I've had some that required tons of adjustments. I bought two of these and all 10 drawers fit absolutely perfectly and all parts were in order with a few spares of each.I think each one took me between 2-3 hours to assemble but I don't move as quickly as I used to and I wish I had a high table or bench to work with as that would greatly easy assembly vs. crawling around on the floor like I had to do. These were to put in a closet that had very limited depth so they work perfectly. I will say the drawers are a bit shallow and wish I had more deeper drawers (for things like jeans) but can't complain too much as this was a perfect fit and easy assembly with not that many separate pieces of hardware.I didn't use any of the safety stuff because I have no little children in my home and in an apartment so can't drill into the walls anyway.",

I added a 3\" 3/4 plywood strip to the top back (to bridge the sides, (4) 90 degree cabinet triangle brackets to the top, changed out the drawer slides to 14\" soft close, added 7\" bar cabinet handle pulls, and drawer dividers, which improved it substantially for a cost of about $80. The product has a chemical smell that lasted for 2 months before it went away. The drawers are only 4\" deep, which is good to store socks, underwear, rolled up yoga pants, or kids clothes, but not many large pieces of clothing.",
