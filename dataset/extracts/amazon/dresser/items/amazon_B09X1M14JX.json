                "reviewText": "This is the second time I have purchased a fabric dresser from this company. I was so impressed with my previous product I decided to get more for a recent bedroom redo for my 9 year old granddaughters birthday. Her bedroom is not large so this particular piece works great as her dresser. The dimensions are 11.8Dx39.4Wx31.3H with 8 storage cubbies. You can get a lot more than you think in these \"drawers\". She is old enough to know not to pull the containers all the way forward as there are no stops and they come all the way out. The depth of the unit is what we were looking for as traditional dressers are too deep for her room size. We also did not want to spend a lot of money on traditional furniture . We wall mounted her tv above the dresser with enough space that her Nintendo Switch fits nicely on the top. Personally I would not put anything too heavy on this especially in a kids room. Unit is pretty easy to assemble but time consuming. We had all the parts and no damage. I really like this furniture and if you buy it knowing what it is I do not think you will be disappointed. Good value, looks nice and lots of storage. We also got the 2 drawer nightstand but was too short to use beside her bed so using as extra storage for her games beside the dresser. Ordered a 3 drawer nightstand from a different brand .. Somdot Small Dresser ... and it is not near the quality as WLIVE. unfortunately WLIVE did not have a comparable nightstand. Would not recommend Somdot fabric furniture...",

The only downside of the fabric drawers is if you fill them when they aren\u2019t in the dresser they flex out and you have to wrangle them into the slot. This is avoided by filling them while still in place. It looks good from the front but definitely should be kept in a corner so you can\u2019t see the gray sides.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this dresser after reading a multitude of reviews (both good and bad, however there were clearly more good than bad). I was very clear on what I was looking for - I'm female with an older brother who has Parkinson's disease and I wanted - or rather needed something I could move around by myself, put together by myself, and yet something my brother could work and utilize by himself. Traditional wooden dressers are difficult for someone with Parkinson's - the drawers are just too heavy for him to pull out and push back in. Additionally, he lives in a retirement/assisted living community and has a rather small bedroom, so we needed something that would fit. I was attracted to the light weight, the fabric drawers, the overall size (there are so many to choose from) but more importantly - the top was made of wood so he could still utilize it as traditional dressers might be. It came quickly, packaging was fine, instructions were pretty good - although, pay attention when they talk about big holes and small holes facing upward - be sure to look closely at the pictures and remember they are referring to the center holes on the bars (I don't know why they don't just say that's the hole they are referring to); I could have used a rubber mallet to push in some of the final pieces, but I ended up just using a set of pliers as a hammer (plastic pieces to fill in the empty holes for looks). I believe they do mention having a hammer available in the instructions - so, my bad. Other than that, the only \"problem\" was a single drawer frame that was slightly bent and I could not bend it back into shape - however, it did nothing to hinder putting it together or impair the use of the drawer in any way. My brother absolutely loves the dresser and I am so happy to come into his bedroom and see that he actually uses it - all drawers are completely filled and pushed in all the way. It's been great! Highly recommend if you have specifics like I did in mind for its use.",
