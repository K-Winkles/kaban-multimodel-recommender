                "reviewText": "I have bought a lot of furniture options from Amazon and they all worked out. I searched high and low and feel I love with this simple dresser. Now, shipping was fast, box weighed 99.2 lbs. all pieces came and the directions. I added wood glue to reinforce things. Material is pressed woods and black satin finished. Very nice quality, some pieces were harder to put in then others, hard to push into place so things can lock into place and every other hole was not all they way drilled. The pegs would not go into the holes easily and then tried to tap into place. To no avail, the pressed wood started crumbling with every turn of a screw. Now the price was too much for the effects that turned into a mess. Now had I not used the would glue, I would have took apart and returned . It was all bad and I would not recommend buying this dresser unless the price drops some under$180. I have a chest of drawers coming and will be returning as soon as I get it. Not work the time or your money",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this dresser for my guest bedroom that I\u2019ve just redecorated from the ground up. The box came with a big tear in it that was covered with tape but nothing inside was damaged.After unpacking it the first thing I thought was \u201cwow, this is going to take a while.\u201d Lots of parts. The instructions are very good though and none of it was particularly difficult to put together, just very time consuming. It took a little under 3 hours to put together, a lot of which was spent hunting for the correct part.The \u201cfeet\u201d are basically bits of rubber on spikes that get pushed into the bottom of the dresser. The holes for the spikes on one side of the dresser were too large and they wouldn\u2019t stay in place so I just hammered them in over a little bit from where they should have been. The dresser seems fairly solid and stable although it does move pretty easily over the floor with a light push.The drawers move smoothly although I\u2019m a little wary of how well the bottoms will hold up with any real weight in them. We\u2019ll see over time.It fits a 50\u201d tv perfectly on top of it and it looks pretty attractive. I\u2019m happy with it so far.",
