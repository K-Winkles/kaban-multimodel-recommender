                "reviewText": "What a charming and uplifting debut! I absolutely adored this book.Lottie has a knack for rescuing older, outdated wedding dresses and redesigning them for a modern bride. She doesn't plan to take these creations public until her cousin desperately needs a gown. She also doesn't expect to have an instant connection with Adam, who is temporarily working at his parents' dry-cleaning shop while figuring out his next career move.While The Dress is a romance at its heart, Lottie's friend group are just as important to her story. These women encourage her to pursue her dreams and they have her back when she stands up to the doubters. I was cheering alongside them as Lottie's confidence in her talents and her instincts bloom as the book progresses.I appreciated that the main characters are adults and aren\u2019t looking to a relationship to make things better.ER Cullen\u2019s writing is wonderful. I highlighted absolutely beautifully phrased passages and laugh out loud lines in equal measure.Jennings Township is full of great supporting characters that add color to the story. I\u2019m especially partial to the meddling moms. The charming stores and community focus make me want to live in this town. Think Stars Hollow with slower talking. But maybe the guy who makes blueberry pancakes wears a backward baseball hat?This book is delightful. I cannot wait for the next installment in this series!If you liked the Lovelight Farms series, go check out The Dress.",

                "reviewText": "This book reminded me of what a community should be. It reminded me that self-taught is still learning. It reminded me that you have to believe in yourself. It reminded me that only you can allow the words of others to make you feel small. Relationships are confusing. Communication is key to all.Most view wedding dresses as a one-time item. Charlotte sees them as so much more. When she sees a gown in second-hand stores, she sees the history of what it was and what it could be. She rescues the dresses, the fabric with the memories, love, and all things and redesigns them with the hope someone else will be able to bring the love and the fabric forward to their own wedding. Although people know she does this, she likes to keep it a secret, and only those needed for parts of her project (such as dry cleaning) see the results.When her cousin has a crisis and comes to Charlotte, she does the only thing she can and says yes, breaking wide open all her insecurities and self-doubt. Will Charlotte be able to create the dress Alex so desperately needs? Will her family finally see it's not just \"some little hobby\"? Will this finally be the start to something Charlotte has so desperately wanted but refused to even hope could be a reality? And what about the dry cleaners son who is in town to help out for a while?Will everything come together for Charlotte, or will she fail? Will some things work and others not? Will there be happily ever after or heartbreak? Read this book to figure out if all of Charlotte is renewed or if just some of the dreams come to fruition.",

It\u2019s a place you want to inhabit so you can engage with all the people who live there. ER Cullen makes you fall in love with Charlotte\u2019s (Lottie\u2019s)passion for restoring and reimagining wedding dresses. It was easy for me to picture the dress and lace in my mind based on the words on the page. Obviously there was a lot of care and research done to make all aspects of the dress restoration process sound true to life. ER\u2019s love of fabric and lace jumps off the page. I\u2019m hoping for another book in the series set in the bakery, Pie in the Sky, because the goodies that were described in this book made me want to run out to a local bakery and get the real thing!",
