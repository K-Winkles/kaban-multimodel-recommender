The top is wood particle board with a metal frame and fabric shelve boxes with a gray wood look to the fronts. I included a side view for reference. This is not a heavy duty dresser but a great value for the price and seems pretty sturdy when put together. It took about an hour to assemble the frame and boxes and my son will love the LED lights. I would definitely recommend or consider buying again. For an inexpensive dresser this was a good size and value.",

                "reviewText": "I was aware the drawers were fabric but from the photos thought the front panel would be wood/ thin cardboard with the wood vinyl on it, like the top however it is just printed fabric that does not even match the tones of the top. Annoying but okay. The light strip is also a little annoying as there\u2019s really nowhere to hide the cord or a hole to run it through to the back. You could make one yourself but I don\u2019t have the materials for that at the moment. And really shouldn\u2019t have to. Also pay special attention to the instructions. I am usually amazing and don\u2019t make mistakes but they are not very detailed and only show that a hole should be there or facing a certain way further into the build pictures. So look over them all and keep in mind where the screws go before starting assembly. Or double check in later sections to make sure things are facing the right way. If your okay with all this then go for it. It\u2019s decently sturdy for the price but probably wouldn\u2019t have bought if I knew about the drawers and light cord. It also isn\u2019t quite as tall as I assumed from the pictures. I looked at the width before purchasing but didn\u2019t look at height \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

                "reviewText": "My son picked out this dresser for his room, and I didn't pay close attention to what it actually would turn out to be. So buyer beware. It has fabric drawers, which aren't super sturdy. Additionally, the wood top of the dresser was broken, cracked, when we opened the box. Because it wasn't structurally unsound, we went ahead and put it together. It looks nice enough, but the pictures are deceiving, so if you're not reading the description carefully, you're certainly not getting what you think you're getting when you look at the pictures. To me, it looked like the drawers were wood, and I didn't pay enough attention, so I was really shocked when we opened the box. That's on me, but I'm glad I didn't buy it for myself. If I had, I'd return it. My kid seems satisfied enough to keep it, though, which saves me an annoying trip to return something bulky. That said, I don't recommend this piece at all.",
