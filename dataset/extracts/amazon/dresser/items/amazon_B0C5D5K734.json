We have two of these exact same dressers in other rooms in our house and didn't have an issue with those drawers. I'm thinking there was some mix up with sizing in the warehouse. You can see that its too tall in the picture above. Other than that, I 100% recommend buying it!",

                "reviewText": "It wasn\u2019t clear to me that the term Fabric Dresser meant that the drawers were constructed from fabric. There is no wood in the drawers. They are made from cardboard sandwiched in between two pieces of fabric. The only wood in this dresser is the top shelf. The sides do not have a wood panel. There is no panel on the side. What you see is the side of the fabric drawers. The reason that all of the photos depicted show the sleeves is to hide the sight of the bare shelves. If you note, in some photos the sleeves are on the right, and in others, they are on the left. They are either a mirror image of the shelf. Since the sleeves go on the left. Or they reversed the right and left vertical end pieces during assembly in order to put the sleeves on the right-hand side. Which means that they were intentionally deceptive.If you decide to purchase this anyway, be careful during the assembly. As some others have pointed out, it is easy to attach the vertical supports backwards. There is no labelling for front or back. The only way to know which is which is to look at the drawer railings. The back of the unit will have a little upright drawer stop tab. But, the vertical piece can be attached either direction. Resulting in the stop tab being at the front. Making it impossible to insert the drawer. Absent the fact that I had to detach and reattach three different supports since I didn\u2019t notice the tab issue, the assembly was fairly easy.As you can see in my photos, one of the drawer heights don\u2019t match the height of the support pieces. So, there is a gap. Also, the lower center small drawer will not slide in and out. Currently, it is more for show than for anything else.We have not put any substantial weight yet in any of the drawers. So, I can\u2019t speak about the drawer integrity as of this moment.Bottom line? The maxim still holds. You get what you pay for.",
