It was simple to assemble and looks great. It even came with an anchor system for the wall, however I did not use it. Its very stable and will be perfect for t shirts, underwater, socks and accessories.",

Assembly was easy took about 30-40 mins (I took breaks) but you could probably assemble it faster. I\u2019m a 5\u20193, 104 pounds and it\u2019s lightweight easy to move around on your own.

We looked into buying dressers but they were either too expensive or cheap and flimsy. Took a chance and ordered two of these. Assembly was very easy and once we set it up, everyone loved it. I ordered two more after that. Drawers are sturdy and slide in and out with ease. It doesn\u2019t take up a lot of space and it very durable. The frame is metal so it will last a long time. We lined three up in my daughter\u2019s room and it looked so sleek and organized. Everyone who sees their room asks where we got the dressers from. I am considering ordering a few more. Great product, quality and price!",

                "reviewText": "The dresser itself is pretty nice. It's sturdy and the drawers are pretty deep. The drawers are technically made of fabric but the front, back, and bottoms are made of some sort of reinforced cardboard on the inside so it provides nice structure that doesn't seem like it will bulge outwards over time (like some cube storage boxes do). The bottoms of the drawers are inserts just like any other cube storage container and when we got ours one of the larger bottom insert panels is missing.We ordered the 9-drawer version (3 smaller drawers on the top section, and 2 larger drawers in each of the lower sections). It was one of the larger drawer bottoms that was missing. Maybe we should have taken the drawers out of the plastic wrap prior to putting together the frame, but we built the frame first and only afterwards took the drawers out of the plastic to assemble and noticed that there was a part missing. Now, I am only given an option to return the entire item to get a replacement which means we would need to break down the entire dresser, package it back up, etc. just to get one single part we needed to complete the set. I tried to contact the seller directly to see if they could just send me the single drawer bottom I need but have not heard back.A bit frustrated for sure.",
