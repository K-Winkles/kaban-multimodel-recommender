I really like the extra depth compared to most other cheap dressers on Amazon, which was why I chose this particular model. It's a bit wobbly side-to-side, but still reasonably sturdy if you don't push on it. I put several heavy books and other items on top and it seems to handle those, along with the drawers pretty full, just fine.Assembly is pretty easy. I only glanced at the instructions a few times but they are fine. The only thing to look out for - make sure you get the two side pieces correct! They seemed reversible to me at first, so I just grabbed one and started putting it together only to later realize they are NOT reversible and I got them backwards! Double check you have the left and right side pieces correct before assembling, and everything else will go smooth and easy.",

This turned out to be an amazing bang for my buck! Super lightweight but well made with sturdy compartments. The top is wood but the drawer fronts are fabric. The fabric that looks like wood is reinforced or something so it\u2019s a little more solid than the rest of the drawer. Makes it look more realistic though. I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell it was fabric until I touched it. I highly recommend!",

The night stands were straight forward with easy to follow instructions but the chest had hard to follow instructions with no detail on how to put it together. Just some pictures that were not clear at all and the hardware nrs didn't match the pictures. Very confusing. took 2 hrs to put it together. Looked good and pretty sturdy when it was done but I wouldn't go through that again.",
