                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. When the stand arrived for assembly, the first thing I noticed is that it was quite heavy. I was expecting a solid construction due to the weight, and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. The nightstand is mostly well made. Like many dressers made these days it\u2019s a type of compression/fiber board that is wrapped in the wood-looking finish.For the most part I\u2019m impressed with the quality of the materials. It did take quite a bit of assembly, but the instructions were clear enough and I have built furniture like this before, so it was relatively straightforward.A couple of complaints: The screws for the drawer rails are short and don\u2019t have big threads, so they barely gripped into the particle board. A couple of them stripped through the wood even though I was gently using a hand screwdriver. Since this is on the drawer rails, they\u2019ll be getting relatively regular use and could easily strip out. If you have some small wood screws with a heavier thread handy use those instead of the supplied ones. As you can see in the video they rattle right now, only because I couldn\u2019t tighten the screws as some had stripped out in the holes.The other very odd and unfortunate design flaw is the USB plug for the lighting is supposed to go into one of the USB ports on top of the nightstand. You can see the white plug sticking up in the photos. This was a pretty ridiculous design decision since it looks weird and uses one of the two ports. Not a total deal breaker since you could just plug the USB lighting into the wall, but it was still just thoughtless design.Overall, this is still fairly well constructed and does look good. I hope they correct these two issues in the future, because this could have been a 5-star review.",
