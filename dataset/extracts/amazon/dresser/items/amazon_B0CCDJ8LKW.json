                "reviewText": "This dresser has pretty great quality to it. It's very sturdy and can hold a decent amount of clothing. It's a beautiful as the product photos display. It looks just as great in person. I will say, that the flower baskets you receive for the dresser drawers; they do not come exactly as pictured. I got 6 different prints in total because, I got 3 of the same print in 6 of the baskets. Basically, I got 3 doubles print wise; and 3 entirely different prints. Totally the 9 baskets. Some of the prints pictured in the product photos I did not even receive. It seems as if the baskets are sent at random print wise. So, do not expect to receive any exact prints. Mine still came out beautiful with how I layed the baskets out (as you have the option to set the designs as you wish). It's a decent sized dresser that does not take up too much space. The dimensions of it is great for small spaces and rooms. Assembly took about an hour. You build each square piece by piece with nuts and bolts and screws. The basket knobs and inserts you, also, assemble yourself. Overall; I'm very happy with this dresser. It looks great in my room and is a wonderful statement piece. The value for the price is spot on. I can recommend this!",
