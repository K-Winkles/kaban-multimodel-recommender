                "reviewText": "So this is my first amazon review but I really wanted to make it aware to those buying it. I spent over $100 for this. I measured it out and assumed it would be bigger based on the measurements. However it's actually really small. My boyfriend (pictured above) is 5'3\" and you can see how tall it is compared to him. I'm personally 5'6\". If I had to give an accurate description, this dresser is meant to hold clothes or toys for young children or toddlers. I was only able to put 4-6 adult pajama pants into one of the big drawers. The smaller ones are definitely good for socks or underwear but for holding pants, especially jeans, thats not the case. That being said, its really nice and decent quality. Wasn't too difficult to assemble, but they combined the screws which look almost identical and there most definitely is a difference once you start putting the X on the back because one screw will work while the other doesn't. Overall I think the price is too high for a small dresser that doesn't hold too much but its not terrible. I do like it, its a decent dresser, very nice quality, it's just meant for smaller items. I think I would have probably given it 5 stars if this was maybe only $40-50 but again overall its not a bad dresser, just on the small side so be fair warned!",
