All you have to do is take your time and just orient what you\u2019re assembling with the pictures in the instruction book. Once assembled, it\u2019s pretty stable but since it\u2019s a shorter dresser it\u2019s not a problem. The drawers operate so smooth it takes very little effort to open or close them. The top 2 drawers are short but deep. The bottom 2 drawers are wide but on the shallower side. This kid does include support bars for the bottom 2 drawers so the middle doesnt cave in. It\u2019s a really nice touch but given the drawers on the shallow side, I dont know that you could really over load them. It looks nice when it\u2019s done the style will fit any decor.",

                "reviewText": "After reading the reviews on this item was almost afraid to order. But I do like a challenge now and then. The item arrived in two boxes well packed. Yes there are a lot of parts, and yes the unit is heavy (particle board). The instructions are good, you don't even need to know how to read, they are all pictorial. The parts are all numbered and called out on the instructions by these. It took me 2.5 hour to assemble this included unpacking. There are a couple of things to look out for, as I found out during assembly. When attaching the rails to the sides, be sure to orient these as shown on the photo, showing the top of the left side. Also be aware that the rails need to be set back as shown in the next photo. The bottom one is correct the top needed to be redone. This is to allow the drawers to go in all the way do to the fact that they are recessed.And yes the holes are not predrilled for these but are marked and the screws drive easily. Resist any notion of using a power screw driver of any kind, you will strip the wood. The other boo boo was part 6 which I installed back wards. As you can see in the photo the cam locks show. However to reverse at this point would mean to have to disassemble much of this unit. If you are a stickler go ahead or just be sure to orient it correctly when installing. If you like me get it wrong all is not lost because the drawer will cover the mistake. The most tedious part was putting together the drawers, there are 5. Also I found that if you did not get the screws in straight for the rails, the drawers tend to hang up as you open and close them. A little adjustment fixed that, but if you are careful during mounting you can avoid a little frustration later on. You will have some parts left over (hardware) The finished product is stable and sturdy. I am happy with the results.",

                "reviewText": "The end product is ok. Using it for a few items and as a TV stand so it will do. Biggest negatives: 1. Assembly instructions are horrible! Had to disassemble 3 times to get it to go together correctly, so took me @4 hours to do. 2. The last step where you install the drawer slides is terrible due to the fact that there are no predrilled starter holes. Luckily I had a hammer to tap some starter holes myself. I was assembling this dresser at another location and not my home, so did not have my cordless drill ( having one would have made assembly much easier). 3. After all the difficulties assembling, one of the smaller drawers doesn't fit correctly. Gave up trying to figure out why.It is a nice size though, and will serve it's purpose.",

The white finish is not uniform and littered with touch ups and apprentice marks.At some point they must have planned for a single knob on the large drawers, as suggested by the hole sloppily covered with brown wood filler in the center of the front panels.Speaking of the knobs; they are made of cheap plastic, with a wafer thin cap to give the appearance that they are made of metal.This piece makes IKEA furniture seem like family heirlooms.",

                "reviewText": "First, the finished, built unit before we get to assembly. For self-assembly furniture these drawers are sturdy and heavy. The drawer runners are all on wheels like more expensive furniture, and go in and out smoothly. The large drawers have a reinforcement piece running across the middle underside, so no bottoms falling out for this model. It also has real aluminum knobs instead of plastic.Assembly, definitely not for beginners. If you haven't done a lot of assembly, I would think hard before buying this. I've done a lot, and it still took me 4 hours to put this together. I would say this is intermediate difficulty. The drawers come in 25 pieces, plus runners and screws and around 30 other hardware pieces. The main case is another 10-11 pieces with lots of hardware. Some parts need traditional screws without pilot holes Use a drill r electric screw driver or your hands will fall-off.Other Stuff: it comes in 2 boxes and they are not delivered the same day. I talked with the seller when I thought I had missing parts and they were very helpful The two boxes are very heavy. I had to take them up two flights of stairs and with the second box I just opened it and carried the contents up bit by bit.",
