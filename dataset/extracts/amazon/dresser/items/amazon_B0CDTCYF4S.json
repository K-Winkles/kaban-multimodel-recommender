I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money & wanted something that I can move easily in case I wanted use in another room other than a bedroom. This unit is great for the price, easy to assemble by one person. Comes with everything needed to assemble including the Phillip screwdriver & Ellen wrench. The quality of the material drawers are thick so they pretty strong with the liner that goes inside for them to keep their box shape. The material is a dark grey for the drawers & the frame is metal and looks very nice once put together.",

All the pieces were numbered and lettered and the instructions were super simple to follow. All the hardware and tools needed were included. I read reviews where people had a hard time putting the handles on the drawers. I did not have any issues as long as you put in one screw at a time. Can't attest to durability yet as I just put it together but it seems sturdy and holds everything I need it to. I would definitely buy this again. \ud83d\ude0a",
