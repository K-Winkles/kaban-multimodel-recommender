These are very sturdy and well built. It only took about 30 minutes, once everything was out of the box, to put together. Everything lined up properly and was very easy to put together. The cloth storage drawers are sturdy as well and move in/out of shelf well...also the wood look is very realistic considering it is cloth. Other similar products on Amazon they are asking double the price as what these were. Highly recommend!",

It was super easy to assemble, had good instructions, the labels are easy to remove, and it just generally looks very nice. I can fit all of my electronic accessories on the shelf except the wifi tower, but I measured before buying and already knew this.Nice and sturdy when assembled properly. I left the corner guards on the top shelf because corners are mean and I thought it added a nice accent.",
