First this six drawer dresser is very nice, don\u2019t expect the quality of a $500+ drawer chest, but this one is very good quality and affordable. It came in a million pieces but once I understood it, it was ok. Beautiful after it was built. Only thing I wish the knots were silver not gold but is not a big deal.Seems sturdy and the drawers ended up being perfectly straight. I was most worried about that part of the build.A little less than one hour and a half for one person to do, but that\u2019s just cause all drawers comes in many pieces, the frame my husband put it together in like 20 minutes. Two people maybe about an hour or less. But everything comes clearly numbered screws as well as the wood pieces.Another thing drawer guides not preinstalled but not difficult. Very sturdy and is easy to wipe off. Drawers are deep, so you can put everything you need inside them. All in all the finish product looks really beautiful and I love",
