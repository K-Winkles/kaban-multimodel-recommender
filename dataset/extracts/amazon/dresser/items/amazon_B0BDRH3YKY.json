If you are expecting a heavy duty, all wood piece, this isn't it. BUT it is perfect for what I needed it for without breaking the bank. Highly recommend.",

My response to them was don\u2019t offer what you\u2019re not willing to provide. I just wanted a new top they offered the refund. Love the piece what I didn\u2019t love is the top came in damaged and the seller did not respond to my request for replacement top",

The wood top is okay on top but the frame is questionable because it does seem like cheap, thin metal. Very wobbly. I worry about putting my tv on it and concerns me with how safe it is with a 3 year old in the house. I was hoping it would hold a good amount of my clothes but to be honest feel like whole thing may fall apart if to much were to go in. Also the size is A LOT smaller then it said. I am disappointed and hate that I believed what I read but its not worth the stress of sending back. We shall see\u2026 ughhhhh",
