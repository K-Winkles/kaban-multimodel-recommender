                "reviewText": "I\u2019ll start by saying the dresser is pretty! The components seem good quality. I am SO FRUSTRATED with the screw portion of the assembly!! The holes aren\u2019t drilled well enough for the screws to go in with ease and if all you\u2019re using is a screwdriver, they are nearly impossible to assemble. I left everything to ex hubs to get out of there quickly so I don\u2019t have a drill. You really need one to put this together but that also comes with its own set of challenges because it\u2019s vinyl over particle and if you\u2019re not careful with a drill, you\u2019ll split or strip those holes. I assembled the main dresser, and screwed the screws to the drawer brackets as tight as I possibly could by hand, and assembled one drawer just to test the functionality of it and because the pre-drilled screw holes are so small, some screws do not sit flush, so the wheels on the drawer catch on them and it doesn\u2019t close smoothly. I will have to go back in with a drill, tighten them all, and even then may have to dremel the edges because, again, they\u2019re not in there straight so they aren\u2019t flush. The dresser itself is so pretty like I mentioned, but another thing is that the drawers are extremely small/shallow so not much fits in each one. Great for underwear and small garments but if you\u2019re storing a jean collection or something, you\u2019re only gonna be able to get a few pairs per drawer. Could be worth it to just purchase a solid wood one from walker edison or something. \ud83e\udd72",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Bought this because it looked like the viral Thuma dresser for 1/10th+ the cost. For a $200 dresser, you\u2019re going to get particle board (as opposed to wood). Other than that it is perfect.The reviews given where \u201cthings aren\u2019t lining up right\u201d are user error. You have to put 3 specific drawers on the right and 3 specific drawers on the left. Also I advise using a power drill, makes things a lot faster.I am using 2 pushed together (2nd one not constructed yet) as living room entertainment center/storage for my condo that doesn\u2019t have any storage.",
