                "reviewText": "I was looking for something to hold all of my tech and this did the trick. I had previously bought the cheap plastic drawers, but they started to bow due to the weight which made it difficult to open and close. These drawers didn't bow with the weight of all my tech, and I love how I can just pull one of the drawers out completely and carry it around my house for small tech projects and slide it back in when I'm done using it.",

As for me, i own a real wood one, but its too fat and not enough storage. Found this and read the description, its perfect. Cheap and alot of storage. A simple downgrade and it fits perfectly in my small room.",

The 'fabric' is similar to the disposable cloth on reusable shopping bags.I could easily lift the box that this whole dresser came in in one hand. Save yourself the return and look elsewhere.",
