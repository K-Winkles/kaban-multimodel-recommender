                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good, Cheap Nightstand",
                "reviewText": "Use:I recently began to repaint and update the spare room for my parents when they visit. I had a folding tray table to use temporarily, but I wanted something that they could put clothes in to leave in case they needed an extra change of clothes. I have purchased similar products to use as dressers for myself, and I have loved them.Pros/Cons:Pros:- Price: I paid a total of $39 USD for this one. It is small, but I think that the price is more than fair for this table.- Size: This is a perfect nightstand size. It stands just about the same height as the bed and has just enough room for a lamp and one decoration. Pefect for a smaller room- Ease of assembly: This took me about 5 minutes to put together. I used my own tools to assemble. The included allen wrench/phillips screwdriver combo is not that great.- Extra components: This really surprised me. I ended up with extra hardware (including an extra foot) and an extra drawer handle. I've actually ordered more expensive things and not received extra hardware.Cons:- Included tool: This is the biggest complaint from me with most self-assembled furniture. The tools are usually not easy to use or do not function well. This is the case with this tool. The phillips end did not work well at all. It was not comfortable to use, and it would not tighten down the screws well. The allen wrench end did okay at best. I ended up using my own tools.- Feet: The leveling feet on this unit were really tight. It is a minor complaint, but I figured I would mention it. When I was installing them, it was pretty hard to get them started and ran down. I figured it was something in the threads that would work itself out, but I found it just as difficult to adjust when I was leveling the unit.Summary:Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. This is a perfect table for additional storage or for a small desser. I really like it as a nightstand in my spare room. If you have a small room and need just a little extra storage, this is the table for you. My recommendation for assembly is to have a #2 phillips screwdriver handy. You can make the allen wrench end work, but the phillips tool is not something worth messing with.I would buy this again any time and highly recommend it.",

I ended up have to buy Goo Gone to remove it completely.Having said that - so far I have purchased three of them.NEW - Just assembled my fourth. They changed the structure a little - it makes it more stable but I didn't have the problem with stability.But they heard me! The tipping caution sticker came all the way off in one easy pull.Great product at a reasonable price. Sturdy, lightweight and very easy to assemble. I'm glad they supply the tools as not everyone has a complete toolbox.IKEA - be afraid!",
