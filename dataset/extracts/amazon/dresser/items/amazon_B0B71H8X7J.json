                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been looking for an affordable dresser to fit in my 3 year olds room to create more space. The reviews were mixed, but I took a chance because let\u2019s face it, everything now is so expensive. This dresser is absolutely lovely for a few reasons.1. Assembly was super easy (I did have a slight issue with the screws vs. what the picture in the instruction manual showed at 1st) we had the frame together in about 15 mins and it would have been faster, but my son loves to help. I will say we did use a socket wrench which I recommend if you have one that fits. It does take a little longer to put the handles on the drawers, but it is super easy and I used the tool that was included.2. Aesthetic and sturdy. They are the sturdiest cloth drawers I\u2019ve ever had. Yes, after you screw in the handle some drawers have a little places you can see where it doesn\u2019t look exactly plush, but I unscrewed them, adjusted and looked better. They all sat very well and even, no sagging. It is light weight and the top is heavier so if you are putting this in a room (not a closet) I would recommend screwing into the wall with the screws it came with to do so. The top of it is very nice. I love the wood color as well as well as the color and durability of the handles.This is perfect for small living spaces and a more inexpensive option for extra storage. I do want people viewing this to keep in mind that the drawers while deep enough it is only 11 inches front to back. It works great for my 3 year old\u2019s cloths. Also, keep in mind the cloth drawers are very sturdy, but I don\u2019t imagine them holding a lot of weight. It just depends what your Intentions for using this is if it is the right dresser for you. Overall, the price point, quality, and aesthetics exceeded my expectations, and I am very pleased with this purchase.",

It looks great in my room and is able to hold my 43\" tv with no problem.I thought one of the bottom parts for the drawers was missing from the package, since it came damaged and open. I contacted client support and they answered me very fast and offered a refund with no more questions. Fortunetly I was able to find the piece (it slided from the box as it was open, that's why I couldn't find it while assembling the dresser) so no refund was needed.I recommend this dresser if you don't have much room for a big one. It works well and it has enough room for me and my partner's clothes.",
