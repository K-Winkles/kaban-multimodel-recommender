This is engineered wood but had no issues upon assembly or daily use. This is easy to assemble and looks quite nice upon completion.If you notice gaps between the drawers and dresser, you have the drawer in wrong. It is very easy to do since the drawers slide so nicely whether they are in the track correctly or not. No need for a major change - just pull the drawer back out from the dresser and try inserting again. It may take a few times and give a few good laughs at your spouse.I purchased two for a walk-in closet due to the lower height sits a few inches below shirts on hangers and would buy again.",

I will say the piece along the bottom on the front got damaged, I was not \"man handling\" it by any means, I put in the peg and put the board on top like it says to and the peg went straight through the front. I had to use spakel to try to fix it which you can see in the images. This dresser will not last a lifetime, but you get what you pay for. It matches the rest of my step daughters furniture and she likes it.",

I hate the fact that you have to screw the bottom of the dressers in. It\u2019s a lot but I wouldn\u2019t recommend if you plan on stuffing he drawers. In other words the durability is a 2 in my opinion.",

We are going to try to get a partial refund for the damage. Little chance yours will arrive without damage.

These are thosewhich snapped into the dresser's vertical sides and center panel by means of their plastic studs fitting into pre-drilledholes. But when the flat-pack box was opened about twelve of these studs had broken off.As the weight of the drawers is supported by these supports, without the studs there is no way to fit thesupport the drawers. Glue or adhesive was insufficient, and I had to screw the supports into place.The packing was strong and well put together but the sliders were on the bottom end and must havebeen damaged during shipping.Problem: We really need three slider supports, but how do I go about ordering them as there does notappear to be a feedback link, or none I can find.Any help?",
