                "reviewText": "I love this dresser!! It's easy to assemble, inexpensive, cute, and functional. I own 6 of these, from 3 different brands and this one is by far the best. The quality is superior to the others I own. It's sturdy and the drawers glide smoothly. My house is very old and getting heavy furniture in and out especially on the 2nd & 3rd floor is nearly impossible. So these things are a life saver. They are easy to move and hold a good amount of clothing. I also use them for storage to keep my rooms nice and tidy. I got it for $35 which is a steal and definitely worth the money. I just ordered 2 more of them... Lol",

But beautiful black on black. Pain to put together. When I move it will be difficult to disassemble. But besides that they give you extra peices with every screw, and bar. I love that they did that. Highly recommend this is one of the cheapest ones I could find and it's outstanding quality and durable. Highly recommend.",

Wouldn\u2019t recommend for anything other than baby clothes or undergarments due to weight capacity, but don\u2019t want my baby\u2019s clothes or undergarments absorbing the smell.
