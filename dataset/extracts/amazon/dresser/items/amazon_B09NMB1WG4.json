                "reviewText": "As a bedside table, it has a decent solid top. But it\u2019s not ideal. The fabric drawers aren\u2019t on casters so they don\u2019t slide in and out, and the piece of cardboard in the bottom of each drawer is likely to warp if you put anything heavy in them. It\u2019s also shorter than I imagined it would be. Good for something like a twin platform bed but if you use a box spring you\u2019ll be leaning over the edge of your bed to reach down to it. Overall, it\u2019s just ok. I think I should have looked for a used nightstand on Craigslist or something.",
