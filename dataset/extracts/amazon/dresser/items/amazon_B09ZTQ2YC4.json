                "reviewText": "I'm happy with this piece. It looks good, feels sturdy, and went together with ease -- but part of that is because I own a drill and know how to use it.The instructions say all you need is a screw driver and the provided allen wrench, but the drawer slides don't have any pilot holes; you'll have to drill those yourself. It's easy though, as the drawer slides line up against proud edges of the drawer and into a corner, so you can hold the slide in place and pop in three pilot holes in the right place easily.It's a shame the discontinued this one; I'm happy enough with it that I came back to order a second one for the other side of the closet. Ah well, my furniture will be eclectic now.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased two of these to use as matching nightstands on either side of our bed. While putting them together was much, much more time consuming and labor intensive than I\u2019d expected (I\u2019m one of those people who actually enjoys putting furniture together), they came together nicely and we love the look.The one thing we can\u2019t get over though is the odor. There\u2019s a strong chemical smell that hasn\u2019t gone away in the slightest (it\u2019s been well over a month since we put them together), and we both wake each morning with a headache. Both units have the odor, so we know it can\u2019t just be a mishap with one.We have decided that we\u2019ll need to place them in another area until (hopefully) the smell dissipates.As much as we really like what the units look like, if we\u2019d have know about this odor issue prior to purchasing, we definitely wouldn\u2019t have bought them.
