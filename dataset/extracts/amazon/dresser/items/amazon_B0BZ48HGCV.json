It wasn\u2019t a big deal, as I figured I could just wipe it down, but some of the marks would not come off and seemed to be permanently stained. I still went through with putting it together. The wood was really poor quality. The hardware was hard to assemble. Not all the hardware seemed to fit where it was supposed to, and the pre cut holes were not perfectly lined up. Even after finishing, the dresser seems to be slightly unaligned. Hoping I\u2019m able to get some sort of refund, and not sure how to take this all apart and still have it be in decent condition to send back.",

                "reviewText": "Sturdiness only improves with glue in the joints. This is true for all assembled products that use a 1/2 turn fastener to hold joints together. I recently ordered 3 different products from 3 different manufacturers. Each has been glued together and by using the 1/2 turn fastener as a joint clamp.This particular product went together very easy, looks nice and is now very sturdy. We have hardwood floors so I attached 1/4 inch thick felt pads to the frame bottom. This helps moving it on the floor without scratching.",

                "reviewText": "I guess I didn\u2019t read the reviews closely. The poor quality reviews are correct. I bought three of these to replace plastic sterilte drawers that I had in my closet for bras, underwear, etc. I had to very carefully hand screw every screw to avoid stripping the boards. Quite a few of the cam lock screws broke. However they seem to stay together ok nonetheless. One of the cabinets is 1/4 inch shorter than the other two so lining them up side by side didn\u2019t work. Luckily I figured out a configuration so it doesn\u2019t matter. And when lifting one just to adjust its placement, I heard wood crack. The drawers are tiny - they actually hold less than the sterilite drawers. All that said, they look far nicer than the sterilite storage and I needed to purge anyway. 3 stars for good looks. I suggest improving the metal bits, and making them 2 inches deeper.",
