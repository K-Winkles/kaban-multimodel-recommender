                "reviewText": "These fabric dressers are the future of furniture and signify the end of deforestation on out planet. They look like all of the various grains of wood, marble and colorful ones are on the horizon, i purchased the BOHO version as you can see. They are extremely easy to assemble and heavy-duty, yet, lightweight to move around the house. When you relocate to a new city or State, The days of requiring heavy-duty moving dollies are a thing of the past! No worrying about the movers scratching up your furniture and making them weak and squeak by being moved. Now, the smaller units like this one, are really short! They are using trick photography here. Lol. So, if you want a dresser that's waste high or lower , you need to order a taller unit. This furniture can accommodate vases, tvs, artwork, etc, as the top is real solid wood. These units come with all the tools and screws for assembly, primarily a hex wrench key, which is more time consuming because they are a pain to turn and get in. Not a major flaw, just a inconvenience in a arthritis sort of way! Lol I urge the reader to get a dremel and use the cutting tool to cut off the top of the wrench provided, this way, you can put it in a power drill as I did, which speeds up assembly greatly. I hope the manufacturer is reading this review and find a way to include a straight Allen key, it will increase sells.",

Well, i missed the part of the actual assembled measurements and its 3 or 4 inches short of 2 feet tall. I mean, i like the build, design and spacious drawers. Easy to carry alone too. Not much complaining to do really, for under 12, id say perfect due to height. For me, im ok with it since tig welded a base and using threaded holes for it instead of the adjustable feet, i hung it on the wall just level with my bed and works great now and im 6ft tall.For the cost, easy assembly and how actually sturdy it is, i would buy another one for a spare/guest bedroom.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Dresser was purchased for respite care youth for weekends. Wanted something easy to clean, pretty light, and easy to move. Purchased during Prime Days, but didn't assemble until several months later. That was a mistake. Open immediately.Pros: This dresser looks very nice once assembled. Also easy to assemble per the instructions (see cons for other considerations however). Did it alone and didn't take very long, though I took my time. Also, for kiddos, the cubes are quite deep, and there are five of them. Also, the price was good.Cons: Several of the pieces came damaged in the box. I added many pictures showing this. They were bent, not soldered well, detached where they should have been attached, and pieces screwed in crookedly that were pre-fabbed. I had difficulty getting the pieces apart, the way they were shipped, and that caused more bending. It all made it more challenging to put togetherThe size is also much smaller than I expected. In my photos, I used my Cricut to try to show/compare length and height, as well as space on the top. I also used a common youth activity box to show/compare the depth of the cubes/drawers.The frame is thin and also malleable. Not for kiddos to hang on or play around.I would have returned and asked for another one since it had multiple areas, but it was months past when I originally ordered it when I put it together.All in all, it will do exactly what I need it to do, and hopefully will hold up well, with light use. I wouldn't put anything too heavy on top of or in the cubes. The instructions do tell you the weight limits.",

They work perfectly and the frame is very sturdy . The top is sturdy and with the metal frame could probably hold a fair amount of weight if needed . Even though the drawers are more like baskets they are very sturdy and slide in and out completely for easy access to whatever you store. They definitely serve the purpose.

None the less they were easy to put together and the instructions were simple to follow. They were still a little wobbly after building, but after you fill them with clothes/items they stiffen up with the weight. My biggest complaint is the depth of the drawers. It's my own fault for not grabbing a measuring tape and realizing the actual sizes of these unts. They are decent quality, arrived damage free, and are stong enough for my fiance and i to sit on while putting on our shoes on in the morning. My only suggestion is making sure you are aware of the sizing and that you are okay with it before ordering. I was able to still use them as end of bed storage, and bought other pieces for clothing storage. This piece I'd say would work well as a TV console; I hope that give you a better ideas on the height and depth of the unit.",
