This fabric drawer dresser fit the bill giving us extra storage for socks, underwear, shorts, etc. It fits nicely against the wall in a very slim and unintrussive way, and it looks nice, not cheap at all. Very sturdy and the top is very solid where you can put decor or a lamp, etc. Was easy to put togther. Took about 45 mins because I hate reading instructions...so I winged it. :) I bought the longer, shorter version of this dresser to match and like it just as much. Recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE Yitahome Dressers! I am an arthritic senior citizen who has many challenges but needed storage for my tiny guest room/den in my small home. I love the dressers so much that I now own four Yitahome dressers. The last one purchased is the large 10 drawer dresser and my small flat screen TV sits on top of this dresser. My home was built in 1957 and does not have a proper linen closet. The large 10 drawer dresser serves as my linen closet. Assembly was easy for me. First, I laid out all the parts that were clearly labeled then read the clear instructions twice & followed them precisely. The first dresser took me an hour and a half to assemble but the other three were done a lot quicker because of my newfound \u201cexperience\u201d. I am sure a younger more agile person would have it assembled a heck of a lot quicker.Be sure to look at the measurements BEFORE ordering. I measured where I would like to place the dressers that I would purchase. I knew they would not be huge dressers, but they are exactly what I wanted for my space. I did not want big & bulky dressers. And when I want to rearrange a room during spring cleaning, I can easily remove the drawers one by one and move the light weight (but sturdy) frame by myself. Easy Peasy.The packages arrived quickly without damage & no parts were missing. I did contact Yitahome Customer Service with a general question. They answered the call promptly & they we helpful & polite.I have shared photographs of my new Yitahome dressers in my den/guest room with friends & co-workers. Three of them went to Amazon and already purchased their own Yitahome dressers in their preferred color selection. My friend has two small grand children and was tired of all their toys in open baskets in their bedroom. She & her son did assemble the dressers in record time. The also secured the dressers to the wall to avoid the dressers falling on to the children. All Yitahome dressers have the wall screw parts INCLUDED with each dresser we bought. A great SAFETY feature to avoid accidents. Now she has two dressers for organizing (hiding) their toys and one dresser for clothes and diapers, etc. One dresser top has the kid\u2019s favorite books lined up neatly and easy reach for the small children. My friend is another Yitahome fan.I did purchase a similar all black dresser from a DIFFERENT company (not Yitahome) on Amazon. Assembly was a little more difficult. The instructions were hard to read, confusing and tiny print. I needed a large magnifying glass just to see these directions A few of the metal drawer guide rails & metal frame were bent. I attempted to straighten them out with a pair of pliers using a rag not to scratch the metal and did the best I could. But the worst thing about this DIFFERENT company dresser was the HORRIFIC stench from the fabric drawers. It was extraordinarily strong odor causing me a headache. I put the assembled fabric drawers on my three season MICHIGAN back porch during the winter and it took a full seven days for the odor to dissipate. When I brought the drawers into my bedroom, I put Bounce Dryer Sheets in the drawers which helped immensely, and the odor is gone. The front of this other manufacturer\u2019s fabric drawers is not as smooth and tight as the Yitahome brand. I will stick with Yitahome for future recommendations & personal purchases.PEACE OUT. From Ren\u00e9e in Michigan",

                "reviewText": "I bought the 4 drawer Charcoal Black Wood Grain dresser and after tax I spent around $44 (deal day). For the price I'm actually really happy with this purchase. I was sceptical knowing the drawers are the fabric kind but they are nice and sturdy and the front has a pretty believable wood grain appearance. The top 'wood' panel is sturdy as well and did not have any damages. The frame is metal and seems sturdy as well. Yes there is a warning sticker on the top about it tipping if not anchored but I'm not sure if I'm worried about trying to remove it since it's in my bedroom. I would recommend anchoring if you think you'll have small children getting into this or in a high traffic area, but I don't have that problem. I did put heavier items in the bottom drawers however to help with the balance. I had measured my space beforehand so I knew it would fit the best out of all of the ones I compared. It was almost the same height as my dresser (but not as deep) but that's ok. The assembly instructions were easy to follow and all of the pieces were included. No damage noted. I liked that the top came with corner protectors and I actually kept them on when I assembled it. I can't speak to longevity since I only just got it but knowing my kids won't be using it I'm sure this will hold up for a long time with the quality.",
