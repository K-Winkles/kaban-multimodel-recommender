That one came with a chipped top, but aside from that is still stable and beautiful. I sent a message to the seller to see if I could get a replacement top for the at one. But I plan on buying a 3rd because they\u2019re the perfect size for my kids, and I\u2019d love them all the match - now my daughter is the only one who doesn\u2019t!Seriously want a larger one for myself. Im really impressed with the quality and stability of the product. Directions were easy to follow. Put the 1st one together my myself at 9 months pregnant, with just a screwdriver, and in about 1.5 hours. With the second one I used my husband\u2019s impact drill and it took me about 45 min.Totally worth the money!",

                "reviewText": "Arrived quickly. Very well wrapped. Very easy to assemble. Instructions have no text just images. Even still the images are excellent and all the parts are labeled. This is a very nicely put together dresser for light duty: light weight clothing and other items. I haven't used it yet and I could be mistaken. Drawer action slides easily open and closed. There are supports under all 4 drawers and at the bottom. There are some wood dowels but no wood glue included-just fyi. Color described as white but I feel it is softer and more like linen or light cream. The drawer pulls are small scaled but work well. No complaints for the money.",

                "reviewText": "The dresser is a small transitional piece for my toddler until we buy her a bigger bedroom set. The assembly was easy, but took a long time to complete. Color matched exactly was was shown in the description. However dresser is very lightweight and material is not very sturdy. If not attached to the wall for my toddler, the dresser would easily tip when she tries to open the correct drawer. Also, the drawer bottoms are not very thick so I would not recommend putting a large amount of clothes/heavy items in them.",
