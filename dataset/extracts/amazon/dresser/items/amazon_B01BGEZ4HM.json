                "reviewText": "So, I just finished assembling this dresser and wanted to write a review while the experience is still fresh in my mind. Before going further, let me say that I have assembled many different types of this \"you-do-it\" furniture over the years (and have the extensive and colorful vocabulary of curse words to prove it), so I feel qualified to give a review. First, this baby is HEAVY. The UPS man trotted it up to my doorstep on his shoulder and sat it down like it was a sack of potatoes, but I couldn't move it off the porch. Once hubby arrived home, we got the box inside (he had to use a dolly, I don't know what they feed those UPS guys!). The parts were very well packaged and all the pieces were there, which was exciting. No serious damage. A slight scuff mark on one of the sides, but since it was going in my closet, I didn't particularly care. Once I began to assemble the dresser, I was pleasantly surprised. (Yes, I assemble, my husband totes. This is why my marriage has lasted over 30 years). The pieces are really solid for this type of furniture. Also, the manufacturer went to some considerable trouble with the directions. They are actually very clear (rather than being written in a dead language that no one has spoken for a couple thousand years), and have many helpful diagrams. They even color coded some of the parts for those of us who have trouble programming a DVR. (Note: you do actually need to READ the directions and follow them even though we all know that real men don't need directions. And no skipping ahead!). I was one of the lucky ones this time and all of my pre-drilled holes aligned and joints fit. Even so, it took me about 2 hours to assemble because the manufacturer put some thought into this thing and made it sturdy. Once complete, I'm really pretty happy with it. Now, something that I don't particularly like. There's no bottom on the dresser. It's open to the floor. Also, the back doesn't go all the way to the floor. This is probably not an issue if it's going in your bedroom or your closet, but if you intend to put it somewhere for storage, you may want to attach some plastic to the bottom/back of the dresser so you don't have little creepy crawlies make themselves at home in your drawers. Is there a gap between the dresser top and the top drawer? Yes. But it's only about 1/4\" and I haven't seen one of these ready-to-assemble pieces that doesn't have gaps somewhere. The drawers fit surprisingly snug, however. I also am not crazy about having the cams on the inside of the drawer where my clothes will go, but that's not a show stopper. They don't stick out so that they're likely to snag on my clothes and I'll probably forget they're there by next week. It would be nice if the manufacturer had included some of those little plastic covers that snap over the cams. Overall though, I'm impressed with the quality and I feel it is worth the price I paid. I would recommend this piece to others who are looking for something similar. (Hint: when assembling, the drawer bottoms sometimes have difficulty sliding into the groove on the drawer front. If you loosen the cams on one side of the drawer, you can slide the bottom into the groove and re-tighten the cams. Worked every time!)",

                "reviewText": "You can build this solo. Here\u2019s my feedback: build the frame and put it where you want it, easy to move it without the drawers in. The instructions are a bit wonky but clear enough if you pay attention to the dots. I was able to assemble faster bc you can do each in assembly line fashion. HOWEVER. this went quickly because I have a power drill. Without it I\u2019m sure it would have taken forever.You need a screwdriver, hammer and Philips head. BUT make sure you have a 24mm drill bit to bore holes because for some god awful reason these were not completely through on several of the the R/L drawer sides on several. WTF??This took me two 45 minutes of tv plus a little getting ahead of myself that I had to undo. The drawers feel sturdy. The stabilizer was a welcome addition. The knobs are ugly but I\u2019ll change them. The drawers aren\u2019t as deep as I\u2019d hoped despite the 82x i measured. The side panel was also cracked but it\u2019s hidden where it is now so I don\u2019t really care however for the money that is pretty frustrating. Bonus, the Amazon in home delivery was helpful and on time.",

                "reviewText": "I've put together almost all of the assemble-it-yourself furniture in our house, and this was the easiest piece to put together despite its size.Positives:1) They don't put those annoying stickers on every part. I hate those stickers! You have to be careful that you're using the correct parts, though. I counted everything out before getting rid of the box. I've been burned by Amazon before when a panel was missing and I didn't catch it until I was almost done with the assembly. This time, all the pieces were there. I put them in distinct piles.2) They give the right side red wheels and the left side blue wheels. So easy!3) All the pre-drilled holes were in the right place.4) They (rightfully) encourage the assembler to use a power drill at the beginning. Excellent advice. Take advantage of the magnetic property of the drill bit to hold onto those tiny screws--there are 48 of them. It goes by much quicker if you just stick them to the drill bit prior to drilling.5) The drawers are more spacious than you'd think. I was able to fit twice as many clothes in the drawers as I'd expected.6) There's a secret hiding place underneath the sixth drawer where you can keep your diary (or whatever).Negatives:1) One of the wheel tracks came a little bent (see photo). I use pliers to bend it back a little.2) See the photo with the diagram regarding parts C3 and C5. At the beginning of the instructions, I was assuming that the grey piece of wood was the piece of wood depicted in. . . grey. It's not! The grey piece of wood is the one that goes on the outside in the front. The holes are all the same.3) It's interesting to me that some of the hardware was isolated and others were all thrown together in a bag like a Halloween candy bowl.Other notes:1) For the drawer stabilizers (the white plastic pieces with the screws pre-inserted), unscrew the screws a tad so you can more easily slide the flat part of the plastic in the groove.2) Don't put the drawer handles on first. Do it last.",

This weighs a lot so if you are a smaller human do not try to move it unassisted! the only reason I\u2019m keeping it is because it would be nearly impossible for me to take back apart and ship back. Honestly unless you need something this particular size I would skip this one.",
