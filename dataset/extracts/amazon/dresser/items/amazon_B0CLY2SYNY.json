                "reviewText": "It looks great and the size is really nice, especially since a lot of the dressers I saw on Amazon were kid dressers. On the downside, the assembly was frustrating. Some of the pieces did not fit properly assembling them the way the instructions said to. It took innovative thinking to get the pieces of the actual drawer to fit together correctly. Once it was figured out we got it, but it took foreveeeeerrrrr.",
