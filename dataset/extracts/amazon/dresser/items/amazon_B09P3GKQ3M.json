Then I proceeded to follow the guide with pieces already with numbers in them which is a big plus. At first I didn\u2019t see the numbers on some stuff, so make sure you look all around the piece and you\u2019ll see it. It took me like a little over an hour. It seems sturdy enough with big drawers \ud83d\ude03",

                "reviewText": "These tower drawers are an amazing value for the money. I really like that the drawers/bins easily slide in and out, completely to look through. It offers SO much extra storage it's unbelievable. I ordered two of these and actually have empty drawers for other items. I never had 'places' to put misc. items. Regular dressers don't offer enough space, they are bulky and hard to move around. And cubbies storage or shelves don't work to contain the clutter. Folded stacks can easily fall over etc.. These tower drawers are big enough to hold adult items of clothing (especially undergarments, socks, pajamas, leggings, t-shirts, work out sets, jeans, seasonal clothing, etc). I also store bulk items that I buy, such as shampoo, soap, lotion freeing up my under sink cabinets and linen closets. Also, I have literally cleared my messy bathroom counters by storing in the bins, what I used to leave on the counter top. I bring the bin to where I get ready and easily put away when done (by keeping curlers, blow dryer, cosmetics neatly under wraps). Even if you have to leave it out it's still easier to tuck it away then looking at cleaning up a whole messy counter. YES! I note this as some reviews said it's good enough for kids clothing storage only. Also the height makes 12 drawers/bin storage available, however, the profile is sleek and not too deep. They are easy to slide to clean around and under (not attaching to wall as I have no young kids & I am planning on putting slide pads under them). Also I just use a swifter type duster to dust the top /front/sides/underneath and it works great. I have much more room in my closet for hanging garments since I now store those clothing items in this unit. I couldn't recommend this item more for quick, affordable storage solutions.",
