Definitely takes two ppl to put together because it takes awhile but it\u2019s easy minus all the muscle power you have to put into screwing pieces together. My hands and arms were sore. Super cute. Drawers aren\u2019t huge but decent size. Worked for a cheap apartment dresser though which is what we needed. We made the cracked piece work when though we had to be careful because it was almost cracked all the way through.

It is a bit lighter in person than the photo on Amazon portrays which we really liked! Can't pull the drawers out completely due to design but we don't mind. Overall very sturdy and we are really happy with our purchase!",

The slide rails for the drawers are all together so you have to guess which side is which. For those of us who are not mechanically inclined, you will likely guess wrong. We assembled it to find out that it was assembled incorrectly (rails were on the wrong sides) and that the draws did not slide in correctly. We took it apart to try and fix it but not all of the same bolts are reusable and not all the same holes and be re-used. We absolutely needed a drill for assembly! Also not all of the original holes come predrilled to get you started or to indicate proper placement.I absolutely would not recommend this dresser to anyone!",
