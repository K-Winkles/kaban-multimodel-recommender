The parts that have the wheels on it are engraved they do not have a sticker on them and you have to have a lot of patience. I\u2019ll let you know later how sturdy it is but so far it\u2019s just taking me very long to read the directions and do everything precisely.Update - I think it took me about 3 hours!!The instructions showed the rollers going past the wood but it\u2019s a 3D effect I had to redo them!! My husband thinks it\u2019s crap furniture and won\u2019t last compared to the nice wood dresser we had but my daughter and I love it- the way it looks next to her bed- we got 2 so she can spread out her clothes and not over load it. I think it will be fine. It may not last as long as wood but I hope it lasts at least 5 -7 years",

                "reviewText": "We are planning to place 5 of these drawer sets in our walk-in closet as an alternative to a traditional dresser, freeing up space in the bedroom. They are easy to assemble with only a screwdriver needed (powered or manual), though it does take some time. Assembly becomes easier and faster with each successive completion. I have completed and placed three so far and they are working well for our purposes. Smooth drawer movement on rollers, sturdy structure, smooth semi-gloss paint finish. I did add some tiny self-adhesive foam pads to the backside of the drawer facade to soften the sound when closing.",
