It was incredibly well organized, easy to follow instructions, and most importantly contains EXTRA PARTS just in case! We kept commenting the whole time about the fact that the person who designed this kit is somewhere out in the world feeling good about themselves because they did a damn good job.A few tips/thoughts:-It was really nice and fun to build with someone if you can get a flow going. I think it took us less than an hour working together.-It was helpful to use a power drill, but REALLY important that you get the screws straight!-The thing is sturdy as can be due to both materials and design, and the drawers slide very smoothly (but again - it's up to you to make sure you screw the screws in straight!)Final assessment: This is a great value purchase. We highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "If you are wanting to do this without the use of a drill, good luck to ya! Tried that with just a screwdriver they supply you and I ended up causing my hand to bleed just a tiny bit. I would recommend using a drill. Between my grandpa and I, this took about 1 hour if not, a little less. The steps are easy to follow and it\u2019s not too bad. This could be used for little things to help declutter your space but I wouldn\u2019t expect to put really heavy items in these drawers. It\u2019s a thin sheet of wood that seems breakable of you put too much weight on it. However, this could be used for makeup, toys, beauty products, snacks, anything really that doesn\u2019t have too much weight. Aside from that, this product seems pretty good!",

The black finish does show fingerprints, dust and smudges, but that's common for black furniture. The drawer glides are metal and they open and they close smoothly. The cabinet is basically fiberboard and cardboard, but it's quite sturdy and very nice quality for the price.",

                "reviewText": "So these drawers looked great at first and I was pleasantly surprised by the clarity of instructions and how most of the pieces were solid wood. But there was one HUGE issue that ruined the whole thing. And that\u2019s that the drawers do not line up!!! They say that you have to be super careful to lay the screws flat or else the drawers won\u2019t close, and I did that. Literally even used a power drill to make sure of it. And yet the pieces still don\u2019t line up on the inside so it\u2019s virtually impossible to open and close the drawers. I have to slam them so hard each time. I\u2019ve only had these drawers for a few days, but the inside pieces are already destroyed from my slamming. This whole things gonna crumble in another few days. Honestly, I\u2019m shocked by this. How is it possible that the most important pieces of the entire furniture are misaligned??? It\u2019s virtually unusable and it\u2019s way too much effort to return. So I basically flushed $60 down the drain. Do yourself a favor and don\u2019t buy this!!! Instead invest an extra $20 and get the ikea Alex drawers. I guess this is my karma for trying to be cheap\u2026",

                "reviewText": "I have a crazy amount of Lego. Looking online a lot of adult Lego fans were sorting their collections into either IKEA drawers or plastic drawers. I liked the IKEA look, but did not like the IKEA price. So I ordered two of these to see if I liked them. They are a tedious but easy build. It\u2019s pretty hard to mess up this build, as it uses a limited selection of hardware to avoid any confusion with screw size, Etc. .The drawers move smoothly, although if the screws aren\u2019t in 100% it may feel difficult to pull out. Don\u2019t fret, just tighten the screws a bit more. I didn\u2019t use the casters that were included, because I wanted to stack them(Not sure if they are supposed to be stacked but they seemed sturdy enough. However I will note, we did receive a caster with a broken brake tab.The build is surprisingly sturdy, even with the twist lock hardware. I would say the hardware included with this build is sturdier than real IKEA hardware. The locks actually feel strong and they let you know they are properly locked by clicking into place.Overall a great way to sort my collection and I love the nice clean look!",

I wouldn't say the drawers are super smooth like a dresser's would be, but that might be just how I put the screws on. Even so, this cabinet should be 20$ max. It's just poor quality stuff. You're better off buying something that's real wood, maybe vintage. Be prepared to put time into assembling this.",
