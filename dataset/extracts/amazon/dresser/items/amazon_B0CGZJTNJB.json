                "reviewText": "These fabric dressers are the future of furniture and signify the end of deforestation on out planet. They look like all of the various grains of wood, marble and colorful ones are on the horizon, i purchased the BOHO version as you can see. They are extremely easy to assemble and heavy-duty, yet, lightweight to move around the house. When you relocate to a new city or State, The days of requiring heavy-duty moving dollies are a thing of the past! No worrying about the movers scratching up your furniture and making them weak and squeak by being moved. Now, the smaller units like this one, are really short! They are using trick photography here. Lol. So, if you want a dresser that's waste high or lower , you need to order a taller unit. This furniture can accommodate vases, tvs, artwork, etc, as the top is real solid wood. These units come with all the tools and screws for assembly, primarily a hex wrench key, which is more time consuming because they are a pain to turn and get in. Not a major flaw, just a inconvenience in a arthritis sort of way! Lol I urge the reader to get a dremel and use the cutting tool to cut off the top of the wrench provided, this way, you can put it in a power drill as I did, which speeds up assembly greatly. I hope the manufacturer is reading this review and find a way to include a straight Allen key, it will increase sells.",

It took me about a hour to be build by myself but if you\u2019ve never build something before if might take you a little bit longer but the directions are pretty straightforward. All I gotta say is be careful with the screws, they can easily be stripped. Other than the stripped screws, it was well packaged and I love the look. My place is pretty small so this fits perfectly, all my clothes were in gray totes from moving and all transferred to this dresser. I also love the fact that there\u2019s adjustable feet because my floor is super uneven!",
