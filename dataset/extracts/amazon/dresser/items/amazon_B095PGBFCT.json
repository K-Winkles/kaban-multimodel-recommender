                "reviewText": "Love this space efficient dresser. I needed something for my walk in closet that has double hanging bars. I was worried it would not fit under the lower bar but it fit perfectly. The outer frame is sturdy and I like the top shelf. There are small spaces between the drawers but that is not an issue for me. The drawers are small but deep so it holds a good amount. It was easy to put together and looks a lot better than the plastic drawer units. I am already ordering coordinating pieces. I could see this unit in a nursery, child's room or closet. I recommend for a cost effective yet stylish option.",

                "reviewText": "Hey there, if you're looking for a stylish and functional storage solution for your bedroom, the WLIVE Fabric Dresser with 8 Drawers might be just what you need! As someone who's not exactly a DIY expert, I found this piece of furniture incredibly easy to assemble. The instructions were clear and concise, and all the necessary hardware was included in the package. It took me less than an hour to put together, which was a huge relief since I can get pretty impatient with these kinds of things.Once it was assembled, I was impressed by how sturdy and durable the dresser felt. It's made from high-quality materials, with a steel frame that provides plenty of support for the fabric drawers. And speaking of the drawers, there are eight of them in total \u2013 enough to store all of my clothing and accessories with room to spare. The fabric bins slide in and out smoothly, and they're deep enough to hold a lot without feeling cramped or cluttered.One thing I appreciated about this dresser is how versatile it is. The neutral color scheme and simple design mean that it would fit in with a wide variety of decor styles, whether you prefer a modern or more traditional look. And because the fabric bins are removable, you could even swap them out for different colors or patterns to change up the aesthetic.In terms of value for money, I think this dresser is definitely worth the investment. It's priced affordably, especially considering how much storage space it provides. Plus, the fact that it's so easy to assemble means you won't have to spend extra money hiring someone to put it together for you.Overall, I'd highly recommend the WLIVE Fabric Dresser for anyone who's in the market for a sturdy, practical, and attractive storage solution for their bedroom. Whether you're a beginner when it comes to home decor or a seasoned pro, this dresser is a great choice.",

                "reviewText": "After downsizing my possessions to make a long-distance move, I desperately needed a dresser or chest of drawers but I didn't want to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on more heavy solid wood furniture because I can't lift and transport it by myself. This chest of drawers is ideal for me. It's lightweight, sturdy, functions perfectly to house & separate underwear, bras, socks, tank tops, sports bras/yoga pants, denim shorts and swimsuits. It ALSO provides a perfect surface for my flat screen TV! I'm 5'5 and the height is on point. Speaking of height.. DON'T do guess work on measurements by looking at the interior design of this product's staged pictures. The company lists product dimensions in the description for a reason. I read a couple reviews criticizing the size of this piece in one's space and of course not a single one of them mentioned misleading or non-existent product dimensions from the company and that's because there isn't misleading or non-existent information. You can't justify leaving a bad review about furniture not fitting in your space if you're too lazy to measure it's placement and compare your numbers to the dimensions in the product description BEFORE you purchase the item! Day one stuff guys! And if your dresser looks lopsided and sloppy it's because you didn't put it together correctly and you overstuffed every single drawer. It is easy to assemble, took MAYBE 20 minutes, and fits perfectly in an otherwise imperfect spot in my bedroom (because I measured and compared #'s beforehand LOL!!). It looks really good up close and far away. Affordability does not always look cheap! I'm happy with my purchase and I'll likely buy again from this seller.",

The drawers are a sturdy fabric with a faux wood front. It almost looks painted on. The drawers are sturdy enough because a little platform insert for each drawer stabilizes it well. It\u2019s very slim and non intrusive. Read the dimensions and measure your space. This fit perfectly in a little nook in my closet and is sturdy enough for socks, undies, pajamas, etc. the top of the little dresser is actually wood (particle) that is sturdy. The whole thing is light enough to move around as needed but very if done before filling it up. I\u2019m very happy with the purchase and will likely buy a couple more.",
