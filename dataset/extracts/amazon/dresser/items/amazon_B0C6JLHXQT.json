                "reviewText": "Instructions are easy to understand if you take your time. This was a simple assembly and I really liked this project. Sizing and quality are great. Only thing I didn\u2019t care for about the quality of the wood was whenever it was time to screw in a certain type of peg screw (unsure of the name)- the wood around every hole kept splitting. Really couldn\u2019t do anything about that but that didn\u2019t matter anyway because it never shows on the outside of the product when you or others are looking at it. It barely shows on the inside. I do recommend taking a little more time and paying special attention to that and also I recommend not using a power drill, those little screws will slip from under you easy with a manual screwdriver so imagine if you a had a power drill? You might actually make a bigger mess than intended if you did that. I didn\u2019t use one at all, I am just saying. Anyway, it\u2019s a great buy- the dresser is beautiful and I love how modern it is. It\u2019s nice and big.",
