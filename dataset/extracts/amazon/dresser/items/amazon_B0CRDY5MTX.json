Drawer space is awesome and the outlet could have been placed in a better location like on the side like the tall dresser and could utilize the whole top shelf. Was very easy to put together I read the instructions first and made sure everything was accounted for before starting. Took about 2 hours and that\u2019s because I stopped several times to help family members and using an electric drill on slow comes in very handy too.",

Sad news is it took me all day to build (even with help) and in the end the top two drawers don\u2019t close all the way and the entire front of the bottom left drawer keeps falling off and has to be reputogether at least once a week. The cam lock nuts keep falling out of the engraved hole because it was made too large by the manufacturer. I am very upset and just genuinely wish this was a sturdier better quality product.",

The drawer doors themselves also are all slightly misaligned with each other so I had to swap some of the drawers around while assembling so that they wouldn't collide with each other and could be closed. Some of the first few pieces needed during assembly are shipped at the very bottom of the box. The included LED strip also uses an app (Lotus Lantern) that isn't compatible with Google Home.Still, now that it's together it feels decently sturdy and does its job.",
