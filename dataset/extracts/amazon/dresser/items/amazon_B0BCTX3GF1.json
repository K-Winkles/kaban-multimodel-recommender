                "reviewText": "This is exactly what I was looking for. It's cute and fits exactly as described. The hardest part of construction was cleaning up the bits of Styrofoam that flew all over. I built it by myself in about 2 hours. No gluing or drilling needed. I only used the included screwdriver, but a drill on low would have probably made it go a little faster.A comment mentioned the bottoms of the drawers while being a little flimsy, but they are reinforced by a metal bar (I don't see them breaking anytime soon).The only drawback is the gliders. They aren't very smooth (altho quiet), but for the price it is totally expected. They don't stick, it's just that when they are closed you have to give a little extra push so they are flush. I'm sure if they become an issue I could simply install better ones.This is the best piece I've seen for this price point. It isn't wood, it is a type of particle board, but the veneer is nice looking and it doesn't seem like particle board when assembled.",

After ordering the product (based on its look and star numbers), I came across two negative reviews (defective parts and uneven drawers on right side). I was apprehensive, but after we installed our own dresser (piece of cake, TY), I was relieved to experience none of the two negative comments. Thanks again for a wonderful product. This is our second Rolanstar purchase.",

Wouldn\u2019t want to support a tv or something more than 50-70 lbs. The color and design feels minimal and Scandinavian without the high price tag. Using this an a baby dresser and it does really well with the included dividers to organize your clothing. Doesn\u2019t seem to have damage. Wouldn\u2019t want to recommend this unless you are patient and smart enough to figure out a puzzle.",
