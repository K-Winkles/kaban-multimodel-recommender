This is great quality for being fabric bins. Pretty sturdy, but if you have children I'd mount to the wall. It comes with hardware to do that if you're okay with putting large holes in the wall (not good for rentals). I was impressed with the packaging, extra pieces, and instructions. I did not like the little tool it came with to put it together, took longer than expected to put together. Overall great for an inexpensive temporary solution to my storage needs.",

It\u2019s also very study and comes with adjustable feet to make sure that it remains level. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "PROS:I love this dresser overall. Assembly was easy for the fact that it was a whole dresser; this actually has me preferring fabric drawer dressers now. The wood slab on the top of dresser is good quality and I love the style. I did not use the stabilizing tools that they included to secure it to the wall, but it\u2019s fine as it is against my wall. Looks great :) the instructions were clear, even for me, since I tend to get confused and misunderstand instructions very easily. It also came with an Allen key that had a screwdriver on the end, which was SUPER helpful.CONS:Some of the screws were irritating to screw in, mainly the screws for the handles on the drawers. For this reason I might recommend to some to just use a fitting screwdriver of their own; turning the Allen key to screw them in was not easy. Also, IT DOES STINK??? It\u2019s not like\u2026 HORRID, but\u2026 it smells like some sort of artificial packaging and made my room smell like it for like 3 days!!!",
