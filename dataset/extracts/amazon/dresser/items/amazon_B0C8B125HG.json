The drawers slide out easily, they are not particularly deep but can hold a substantial amount.I purchased two. One holds medical supplies, prescriptions, massage equipment, etc. The other holds craft supplies, ribbons, computer paper, paperwork and current bills. I am completely incompetent when it comes to assembly but I was actually able to put this together!! Well, there were a few things backwards that I had to redo! ;) I had to redo bc I removed all the plastic bags on the pieces to organize them up , not realizing each bag has a letter of the alphabet which corresponds to the printed instructions!! The visual instructions are clear. There are lots and lots of screws of various sizes. Miniature tools, including an L wrench are included. I would advise you use a real Phillips screwdriver, otherwise you end up with very sore finger tips. This can be assembled alone but having a second person to hold and steady the parts makes it much easier. I think you will be pleased with this purchase.Al",
