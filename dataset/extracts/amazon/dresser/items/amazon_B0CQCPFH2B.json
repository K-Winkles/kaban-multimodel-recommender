                "reviewText": "I love this dresser! We are currently using it as storage, and a means to organization.- Good, simple quality- Very inexpensive solution when you need an otherwise expensive dresser- Looks awesome- Very easy to put together, but much easier with 2 people. It took us less than 30 minutes. About halfway through we switched to using a drill, which really sped things up.The only thing I didn\u2019t like is that when we opened the box, the Styrofoam inside was broken, and little pieces of it were everywhere, and worse, the wooden top was damaged. We were still able to be put it together and have it look nice, but the damage can be seen on the top edge. It was sent in a box with a box inside that box, so I can\u2019t imagine how it was damaged. I contacted the company, who responded right away, and they very promptly sent a replacement part.This would make an excellent gift for someone getting their first apartment, or just needing a dresser. Just about anyone would find a use for this and would love it.",

I've gotten rid of all the 1970s furniture and I'm updating EVERYTHING IN THIS ROOM to give it a more modern look! I assembled this awesome roomy dresser in a matter of 45 minutes without the use of the instruction manual! The drawers were the most time consuming ordeal and they're normally the easiest step in the building of these types of prefab fabric drawer type of furniture! They ship you everything that you need to assemble this dresser. And also a few little extra things like extra bolts and screws in case you lose anything. The drawers hold a whole lot of things. I'm using this for the bedroom but it could be also used as drawers for an art room, a classroom, to store things in the garage, or it could be used even to store things in an office setting like as a file cabinet for a home office.",
