The reclaimed wood appearance is very nice, but realize that it is more of a wallpaper replication of reclaimed wood. It is very, very nice for the price. I recommend this if you do not want to spend 4 times the price for a real wood chest of drawers. The instructions to assemble were very precise. It suggests 2 people to assemble. I am a 60 year old woman and I assembled this by myself with no issues. It did take me almost 2 hours to assemble.",

Building was not fun and came with cheap materials and I ended up resorting to actual screws rather than their plastic inserts they supply. The biggest flaw from the beginning was the bottom of the drawers. They are weak and cheap. This drawer will work perfectly for LIGHT items such as baby clothes. We had this and about 4 months in had to take it apart to reinforce the bottoms. Here we are 1 year down and the drawers have completely collapsed. Kind of wish I listened to the reviews.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the bed frame dresser and nightstands, all in \u201cwhitewash\u201d however I received the wrong color in the nightstands and dresser. Honestly if I\u2019m paying 300 for a dresser I better receive the correct one. Also, the product was made sloppy, I can\u2019t even screw the metal base onto the actual dresser because the welding marks where the metal connects prevents the screw from laying flat so my dresser is just sitting on top of the base, I literally don\u2019t have the energy nor the will to take this entire dresser apart to revive the correct color at this point. Yes the fruniture looks amazing and it is beautiful, it is overpriced and clearly nobody pays attention to what they are sending to customers, everyone in the comments complains about the screws for the tracks and those are easy Peasy, it\u2019s the stupid. Also not to mention one of the drawers would not open even, even before I put the drawer actually in, I had to break pieces off the track for the drawer to actually open. Honestly save your money cause I don\u2019t think this is worth anything more than maybe 200. In the photos you can see that they are 2 different finishes and colors and I triple checked, they should have been the same colors. Very disappointed",
