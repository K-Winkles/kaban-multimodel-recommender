                "reviewText": "After reading the reviews I was a little worried but I had seen this exact product listed elsewhere for twice the price so I decided to go for it. To my surprise everything was in great condition on delivery, assembly was very simple and straightforward especially when comparing it to similar products I\u2019ve gotten from American furniture warehouse, with fit and finish after completion to be the same if not better then those too! It looks fantastic in my room! The reviews about the drawer pulls are dead on though. I expected as much, opening and closing the drawers was pretty wobbly and wouldn\u2019t always close flat but now two days of having this my top drawer falls down in the back if I close it all the way. I had planned if this was the case I would just install my own which I plan on doing tomorrow and should fix the problem. All in all if I had payed $250-300 and had good drawers I would be content and very happy with the purchase, this is way cheaper and I have to spend a little extra time fixing it so it works out and I\u2019m glad I bought it!",

I hate building furniture but these were super easy to put together. I will say you get what you pay for in quality. Compared to other dressers these are pretty cheap so the wood isn't real and the hinges do move around a little. The drawers are pretty shallow so if you're looking for something to store a ton of clothes in I wouldn't recommend getting these. Overall they have been perfect for me and I love the boho vibe they add t my room.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: the company reached out to me and offered to send an additional dresser to match one of the ones I bought. Very nice of them to do so.I love the design, however, functionally they are a bit small, don\u2019t hold as much as most regular sized dressers. My biggest problem with this order was that they sent me two slightly different dressers. They arrived and I built one and was excited so I started building the other and there were small differences but I figured it\u2019s probably fine and when I finished building the second one I went to put the handles on and they look noticeably different than the first one. The handles are two different shades of gold, different lengths, different designs too. I was very annoyed but I wasn\u2019t about to undo all that work. Just frustrating. The front panels are also slight different in the thickness and the legs slight different in the way they\u2019re made. I might just order some new handles and use it in our guest room because we need something that holds more for my husband and I. But if they had been identical it would be enough drawer space for one person and would look great.",

It did take a long time to make, but once you get into the groove of things, the directions are easy to follow and takes about an hour and a half. The quality isnt the best, but I wouldnt expect such high quality from something that was only 140. Instead, I am happy with the price, the overall look of the product and how it just looks expensive, like a dupe of the kids Maren Olive Green and Cane Wood 6-Drawer Dresser from CB2, which costs over $1000!So definitely worth the money, for its aesthetic but quality isnt the best.",
