                "reviewText": "Nice looking dresser, the instructions don\u2019t come with words so u have to go just off pictures ,no matter how tight you put the screws the drawers just get stuck on the track, very cheap material and can easily tip over just by trying to move it (yes we tightened it the best we could without cracking the wood), the drawers don\u2019t line up very well just overall really cheap looking and working dresser would recommend spending the extra money on something better quality, drawers also don\u2019t come out very far Beacuse the tracks aren\u2019t long enough, you have to constantly re position the drawer when pushing them in to get them to line up otherwise some are longer than the others, we spent hours building it and being confused by the instructions I would take it down and return it for my money back but I\u2019ve never had good luck returning things definitely not with a big dresser so we are going to make it work till we have the money to buy a new one , definitely would not recommend buying if u have kids if they hang on it even once it will bring the dresser down it\u2019s not very sturdy. Hope this helps I\u2019m sorry not the best review just disappointed in the product.",
