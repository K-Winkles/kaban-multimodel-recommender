We're all about it. This dresser's got a waterproof vibe thanks to its super-secret sealing process, ensuring a slick surface that's tougher than a weekend warrior.",
            "TIME MACHINE NOT INCLUDED - LINSY HOME dresser's got lines so elegant, they're practically swiping right on your eyeballs. Framed drawer fronts and posh pull handles bring more charm than a stand-up comic at a cat convention.",
            "STUFF HOARDER'S PARADISE - Behold, the almighty organizer of chaos! With 6 roomy drawers, this white wonderland can gobble up everything from socks to sippy cups, and even those mystery items lurking in the abyss. Bedroom? Sure. This magical portal of tidiness doubles as a TV stand too. (FYI: The top can handle up to 66lbs, so don't stage a dance party up there.)",
            "ROCK-SOLID AWESOMENESS - This dresser's got a thicker build than a Shakespearean tragedy. The wooden frame and burly panels give it more stability than a cat meme on the internet. It's basically the Hercules of dressers \u2013 no weird wobbles or \"hey, I used to be straight\" curves after a few years. Dimension-wise, we're talking 15.7\"D x 47.2\"W x 31.2\"H of pure majesty.",
            "DRESSER DEFENSE SQUAD - We've included a wall anchor kit because dressers tipping over are so last season. Drawer danger? Not on our watch. Smooth metal runners in each drawer partnered with safety stops mean no rogue drawers trying to escape. And don't worry, we've even thrown in the hardware and assembly instructions \u2013 though we strongly suggest an electric screwdriver and a dynamic duo for maximum furniture-fu."

The back boards and ends are the heaviest, so someone helped me when it came to the final stage of assembly, but I was able to assemble most of it downstairs and finish it upstairs in the final space. One of the drawers is only opening halfway, so I will need to troubleshoot that. Otherwise, the rest works well; looks really nice in the room; is sturdy; and provides ample storage. It perfectly met what I needed storage-wise. I wanted the height, drawer depth, and dimensions that this dresser offered that I couldn\u2019t find in similar models, but I did decide to change out the hardware from black handles to brass ones as shown in the photo. The distance for the drawer pulls was 3 3/4\u201d. All in all, I was happy with this purchase.",

Overall I\u2019m really happy with my purchase and I think they\u2019re a good value for the price.I took two stars off initially because I bought two of these as end tables for my bedroom. One of them was missing the bottom piece. We tried calling the number on the box for any after market concerns but the number rang one time and then the call ended. We also left a message on the contact us but got no response.I used Amazon to request a new part and customer service was fantastic. They quickly replaced the incomplete dresser. We have both tables set up and I\u2019m extremely happy with my purchase!",

                "reviewText": "This is a great dresser until I realized it took me 4 hours to put together and one drawer track was bent, the handles cannot be screwed in (asking for replacement from company website), the drawers don\u2019t fit seamlessly, they either go in too far or stick out or are lopsided, and one of the screws would not screw in straight for the life of me. I like the material and the look, but I\u2019m disappointed with the quality of the manufacturer. Hoping I will get replacement parts because I really like this dresser and don\u2019t have the desire to tear it apart and return it.",

Thought it was the nicest looking one for the price. Loved that it had real rails for the drawers to glide on. The package arrived in mostly good shape. All items included.There are some quality controll issues.1: The screw holes for the rails and drawers are not perfectly drilled. I had to rearrange my 6 drawers so that they would not grind along eachother. I'm lucky I found an arrangement that worked smoothly.2: The black material over the wood flakes off. I've had to use both a sharpie and black electrical tape to cover up wood spots to keep the material on. This is a small issue.3: The threading on the drawer handles were not adequate to be held in by a screw. 2 months after the purchase I'm still stuck with a drawer without a handle. I reached out to their customer service who had replacement handles sent in 2 weeks. Only they were the wrong color... They then apologized and said they would send the correct handles but it's almost been 3 weeks now. We'll see what happens.Tldr: I actually like this thing and am not upset with the $230 I spent on it. I knew it wouldn't be perfect, but it's so much better than what I had before. Looks great too. I recommend it if you're willing to cover up a few flaws.",

For a dresser under $300 you would be shopping at garage sales or places like Walmart, so I didn't have high expectations. I've put together and restored a lot of furniture so first tip, if you're wanting a sturdier piece use wood glue when assembling. (That being said, if you aren't confident in putting together your own furniture, make sure it's assembled correctly and then reassemble with wood glue.) The drawer pulls are cheap crap (same quality as disposable silverware) so I will be buying new drawer pulls. The drawers slide nicely, the beveled edges make it feel more expensive, there were a few tiny scratches but no significant damage or anything noticable from a few feet away. I really gave this item 4 stars because for the price you probably won't find anything nicer unless it's gently used. For what I need I'm happy with it.",
