The instructions are all drawings with 8 steps to the assembly. Took maybe 30 minutes to have it all together. The one that is together is study enough for what I am going to be using it for at the bedside.I wouldn't try to put the reading stack in the drawers, but the top will be nice for a lamp and a stack of books. Drawers will be fine for socks, unders, and things I want at hand. They are fabric with 1/8\" (ish) pressboard panels all around and a panel for the bottom that fits tight enough for things not to get under them. So far, I am impressed, and might get another for the office.",
