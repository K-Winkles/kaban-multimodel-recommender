I downsized from a large bulky 4 drawer dresser that was twice the size of this one, and I managed to get all my clothes to fit. I also love the little shelf on top. I use it to hold my jewelry and perfumes and it\u2019s perfect! The fact that it\u2019s cloth and metal (and not wood) is amazing - my dog likes to chew furniture and she hasn\u2019t bothered with it. It\u2019s very sleek and doesn\u2019t take up a whole lot of space. I was nervous because of the cloth drawers but they\u2019re actually pretty sturdy and lightweight. Easy to move around the room by myself - with the drawers full!",

You can not get it close enough to wall. Do not buy if you have toddlers! Other than that I am happy with it. We do not have small children around so works for us. Would be better to secure to wall with screw and canvas or leather strap. Or wire to secure with the screw.",

I don't heavily use most of the drawers but if you are planning on going in and out of the drawers several times a day or overloading the drawers or heavy use, this may not be the drawer for you. I don't recommend for children. Also they don't have replacement drawers but they're pretty sturdy.",

                "reviewText": "We have 3 of these dressers now. Two of them do not have the upper ledge this one has, but all three of them are from the same manufacturer. We have 5 daughters and bought the first one for my youngest. My 11 year old decided that she loved it and used her own Amazon money to buy one for herself. A third daughter asked for this one for her birthday. I am sure we will eventually end up with 2 more, one for each kid. They are lightweight, but pretty sturdy considering they are fabric. They look very nice in the girl's rooms and are super affordable. I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for a dresser that they don't want to spend a fortune on. I would say these are absolutely perfect for kids rooms and people just starting out.",
