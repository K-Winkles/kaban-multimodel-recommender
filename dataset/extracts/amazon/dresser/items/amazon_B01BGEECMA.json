Great instructions and easy to follow2) I love that it has actual drawer slides. Just so much nicer and quieter.3) They feel pretty sturdy overall and I like them.They're the first \"real adult\" dressers I've gotten and they're a huge improvement. The finish isn't super durable but it's a dresser not a cutting board I don't think it's a real negative.I'm thrilled I got these. Until I decide to get a complete bedroom set these are going to be awesome.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Drawer bottoms are flimsy, otherwise so far so good",
                "reviewText": "You always have to keep in mind that you get what you pay for. Buying cheaper furniture, you're not going to find solid oak built to last 100 years. This is an MDF dresser, and will most likely last as long as you would expect cheaper MDF furniture to last. Not just for this item, but for all cheaper items, you should always keep that in mind when purchasing. You want super solid, then spend more.With that out of the way, I set up this dresser and it has been in use for about a week. The only complaint I have is that one of the drawer bottoms came out of the package damaged. The edge was ripped about a half an inch in, which obviously would make it useless. I did not even attempt to contact the seller, so I cannot speak upon if they would have replaced it or not. What I did instead is go to Lowes and for ten dollars, I purchased a 4x4 sheet of hardboard, and cut it myself. This is a little sturdier than the drawer bottoms provided, so I used it for all 4 sheets. The drawer bottoms are usually the first thing to go on most cheaper built drawers whether we're talking dressers or cabinets or anything like that, so it was well worth it to me. If you do not have the tools or do not want to spend the time to do this, you should still be ok with the material provided. I want to stress, having bought a lot of cheaper furniture in my life, this is not an issue specific to this item. You will find similar issues with everything at this price point.Now that I have it all set up and put together, it seems fairly solid. It's not wobbly or anything like that. The drawer slides are smooth, and they are metal with wheels, not some clunky groove type slides that rubs against the sides.Overall, I'd say for this price, I'm glad I purchased this dresser. I can't speak to durability or anything like that yet, but if I run into any issues in the future, I will be sure to come back and update.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m a civil engineer, so I have no issues following directions and setting up furniture. This four drawer item was just bad: the manufacturer wood would split without almost any torque, leaving the screws that\u2019s supposed to be inside the wood exposed, so I had to try to screw in the pieces with my own small screws to get it to fix the manufacturer\u2019s exposed pieces. Even with delicacy, the wood still splint so I was unable to literally set up any pieces other than the drawers (which some screws wouldn\u2019t fit properly, so I had to add a tiny piece of wood instead the screw placing so that the screw would actually fit properly. On top of all that, the instructions were so unclear as to which way pieces fit, so I found myself unscrewing the door slides and having to switch sides at least 6 different times.Like I said, I\u2019m a civil engineer, I build roads and buldings, I have no issues following directions/plans and I have no issue building furniture, and you get what you pay for, but for $150 dollars, this item was so poorly made I felt compelled to warn others.If you do purchase, be extremely careful with attaching parts as they are very prone to splitting the wood.I received the item Friday, spend all day Saturday trying to assemble the item, and I was unable finishe due to the poor quality. I submitted a return that same Saturday.",

I purchased one of these press board cabinets and was amazed at how easy to assemble. I was cheaper than my local Lowe's and delivered to my door. I decided six months into this project to mirror both sides and purchased another unit and it arrived in perfect condition and bang! I had it together and installed on the left side. I will post pictures showing these units when I have completed the last of this rehab. Yes I highly recommend this cabinet for my use but I am not sure of the safety of it for child's room even with the attachment they provide in shippping. Since I installed two you can say I am happy with my purchase.",
