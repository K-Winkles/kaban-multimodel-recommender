It is not solid wood paint chips easily even when putting hardware.Assembly: Instruction is clear but executing it is time consuming. Someone mentioned that her husband did it in 2 hours. I have assembly skill of above average and it took me about 3.5 hours. I do not recommend using power tool, and considering that there are about 180 screws, I do not recommend this to anyone who has tendinitis or similar problems.Value: $100 is a good value but adding $40 for shipping, make it average.Considering exceptional customers satisfaction and the elegant look, I think this product deserves a 4 stars rating.",

It lost a star because during assembly, the wood would easily chip off on the premade holes. This happened on every single one. No I did not use a drill. I used a screw driver I had from a previous purchase. No matter how gentle or firm I was, the wood chipped. There was also an extra part (#18) that was not included in the instruction manual. I can see where it could have gone. I\u2019ll post pictures once Amazon lets me.",
