Leg connectors go nicely into their slots. Looks decent. Great priceCons: Not substantial. I\u2019d not put anything heavy on the top shelf or in the canvas drawers. Legs don\u2019t line up smoothly at the middle connection. Screws are all exposed (I\u2019ll paint them white).Notes: make sure the leg connector holes match the hole sizes in the legs. Hand tighten all cross beams and shelf to one side before trying to attach the other side. A power screwdriver with a Phillips and hex drivers will vastly speed up the process.",

When I accepted the offer, they then told me that they could not provide it to me and to go through Amazon customer service. When I contacted Amazon customer service they seemed very confused and kept saying I needed to return the item. I said \"I don't want to return it, that was never my intent, I just think if they're going to offer me a refund that I should get it.\" After they spoke with their supervisor I was granted a credit (not exactly a refund but ok). It was such a terrible experience start to finish. I would not recommend this product or this company at all.This thing was a nightmare to put together. It took over an hour, the instructions are very vague and nonspecific. I had to attach, then disassemble and reattach pieces because it's so unclear how it's supposed to go together. The two small rods on top were unable to be attached because there are no holes on one side. I was able to mostly put it together and it will be fine fr what I need, but geez what a nightmare...",
