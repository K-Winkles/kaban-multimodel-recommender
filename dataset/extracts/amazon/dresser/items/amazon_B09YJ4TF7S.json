In the 2nd, the drawer inserts were too wide and did not fit.The dowels holding it together break and don't fit.Now for the fun part of taking them apart and returning them for a refund...just a colossal mess and huge waste of time. Note: we have put lots of furniture together, so when one thing is missing, can easily cut a piece to fit. This was the worst kit l have ever seen.Since these were for closet storage, we thought we would go ahead and keep them but they're worthless.The 2nd one the drawers just did not fit. Did. Not.

                "reviewText": "The assembly took a few hours for me to do, so that\u2019s the most annoying part. The middle drawer gets stuck so i have to lift it up and pull. Overall this is a good buy for those on a budget. It\u2019s sturdy and not flimsy at all. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",

I wood glued all the pieces for extra stability and hold.The most disappointing thing is the missing screws and the weird clear plastic plug things, both was missing one from the set. We also didn\u2019t get the wall brace so it doesn\u2019t tip over (yet has a very specific cut out for it).I\u2019ll update my review in about 3 months and see how it holds together.",
