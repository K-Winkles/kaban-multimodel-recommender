I am a female college student that is moving to different apartments almost yearly and this will be so easy to disassemble and move around. I am 5' 8\" and it sits a little below the hip, I wish it was a little taller or I was a little shorter haha. You do have to hold the drawers when you open them because there are no supporting rods to roll them out on. I still love it and think it is a great addition to my room",

Something with a lot of storage, that didn\u2019t cost my entire paycheck. But also wanted something that looks half way decent. This fits the bill. Super easy to assemble. Looks like wood from a distance. Goes well with any decor theme. Two drawers were slightly damaged. A bit disappointed about that but not enough to pack it up and return it.",

Once you set it down you can never move it or ever lift it again unless you have a crew and it takes me a lot of time to assemble a crew.I wish it were a little but deeper but it's enough",
