                "reviewText": "The tower was easy to put together by myself (less than an hour), plenty of extra parts included (except the foot piece, which I'll get to in a moment). The finished product looks great and I can store a lot of stuff in them! The fabric cubes feel very durable and the handles don't feel like they'll break off or rip through with any force.When I received the parts I got one extra of most parts except one of the foot pieces, which I ended up needing as one had a bad thread. I contacted customer service and they talked me through the issue, sending me a new pack of foot pieces quickly. Very friendly too.",
