                "reviewText": "This was easy to put together and is a great size, has nice drawers and a simple design, fairly sturdy and quite light weight which is nice since I am not a big person. The only drawback that I did not foresee becoming a problem is that because the drawers are fabric they are very attractive to cats. Not only does our cat open it up and crawl inside but she also uses it as a scratching post and has completely ruined the front of several of the drawers. So, just a fair warning to cat owners, this will not be nice for long.",
