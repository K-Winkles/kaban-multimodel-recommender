I ordered it in pink for my new office (my whole office is decorated in pink and black), and it is AMAZING. The color is exactly what I was hoping for. The frame is SO STURDY, and it wasn't hard to put together. My only tip is to make sure you line up all of the lips to catch the drawers on the same side, or you will have to go back and undo some of your work to fix it. I learned the hard way, and it was still easy to put together. For the storage, cuteness, and sturdiness, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. It's a big bang for a little buck.",

                "reviewText": "I got this as extra storage for under my daughter's loft bed. It fit even with the legs on, but I left them off and it works even better. The drawers slide out fine even when the legs are off. We keep Build-a-Bear stuffies and clothes in the drawers, and a few other knick-knacks.The corners might be a pick pokey, but not too bad. Nothing was damaged, it was easy to assemble, and it looks exactly as pictured. I love the reflective gold pattern.Note the knobs were a little harder to attach for me than I expected, in that it takes more pressure than knob screws usually require, and at first I thought the knobs were not aligning properly. But once you screw it all the way in, they are sturdy and don't look off-centered. So just use some elbow grease even if they seem a little wonky, and, if it's like mine, it'll turn out just fine.",

                "reviewText": "This nightstand was so easy to put together and the diagram was easy to follow. I put all screws together by size on floor or table and took my time to make sure I was using correct screws. Everything was marked perfectly on diagram on paper but would have been nice to see stickers of corresponding images from diagram on the actual pieces but it was easy to put together needless to say. The first one took longer than 2nd one. Assembling 2nd one the following day was quicker. My suggestion is go slow and make sure you are putting everything together in the right way. I had to redo the piece that had the outlet in it on the 2nd day. I put it in wrong way the 2nd time not paying attention. Lol! Looks beautiful on both sides of my bed. I should have made a video but didn't anybody to record it. I would have done a step by step video. Maybe next time. Also drawers are nice and deep. Very spacious even though the packaging says to secure it to the wall and it gives screws for that, I am not doing that because I live in an apartment and don't want to put holes like that in the walls. I suggest not putting heavy items in the draws. And make sure pets and children don't play on it.",

I found these dressers and ordered the night stand, a tall dresser, and a wide dresser. Assembly wasn't too awful - the items were all separated but weren't marked as to what number or letter they were so that slowed the build a bit, but not too badly. Everything was packaged so that there was no shipping damage, the design on the front of the drawers is so cute!",
