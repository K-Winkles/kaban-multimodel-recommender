                "reviewText": "Great price for a nice casual, useable, sturdy dresser. Assembly was easy - directions very clear - all parts clearly labeled and organized. So much easier than anything from Ikea. The included multi-tool is appreciated, but if you use your own tools (especially a small screwdriver) it can be assembled much faster. Took me about 45 minutes.We are very pleased with the look and quality.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the 7 drawer dresser for my 4 year old's room and it seems like it will work perfectly. It was very simple to put together, instructions included detailed pictures and worded descriptions. Although it is slimmer than I imagined, there's plenty of room for all his clothes. I also like the look and sturdiness of the fabric drawers, they are not as flimsy as other fabric drawers I've bought in the past.",

It looks very cute and fits the space I needed it in. Not heavy, just what I needed.Cons: some of the fabric cover of the drawers came already to the point of ripping, especially on the left side of drawers, looking at dresser(see photos). I wish there was a way to get replacement drawers, as I am not going thru the dissasembling process to return it. This took a couple of stars of rating as it has dubious durability now.I will review again after I contact seller about this issue.",
