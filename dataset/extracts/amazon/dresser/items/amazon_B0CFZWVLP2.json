Super super easy to assemble, a freaking monkey could do it. It is a little small, woild be better for storage or children\u2019s clothes. Overall, a nice product with a great price, super easy to assemble, fits in small areas and really looks great",

I was a little concerned about how sturdy this was going to be but once it was together it proved to be quite stable and has a sturdy feel. The adjustable feet are a nice feature. The fabric covered softside drawers are of good quality and the drop-in bottoms are plenty strong. We needed something that was very close to this specific size, and once I put it together it has proved to be exactly what we needed. Good product and a good value.",
