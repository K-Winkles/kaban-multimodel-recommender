So far I've been impressed that despite the drawers being fabric they seem to be pretty sturdy. I was a little surprised because the front of the drawers looked a little more real in the pictures but are definitely fabric. They look fine from a distance though so I don't really care. My biggest complaint is I bought this specific dresser for the side storage and they look absolutely nothing like what was shown in the picture for this color. That was very disappointing and it makes it look more of like a college dorm item. Otherwise pretty pleased. (Also, yes there was a smell, but I did not find it that offensive and it went away in a few days.)",

                "reviewText": "We bought two of these for young children. The assembly was straightforward, but both kits were missing one bolt. I found bolts at a local hardware store. The drawers seem sturdy for fabric drawers and I like the dividers. The drawers pull all the way out very easily, so we'll see how that works with the kids. My big concern is a very strong smell which, while not offensive, has triggered my allergies. My head is very stuffy and I sneeze whenever I enter the room where they are. They have been set up for several days now and it hasn't abate too much. Doesn't seem to bother the kids, but I am going take all the drawers back out and air them to see if that helps. I'm concerned about their effect on little ones.",
