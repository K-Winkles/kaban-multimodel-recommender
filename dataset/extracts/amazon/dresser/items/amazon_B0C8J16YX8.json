                "reviewText": "It looks nice. We bought 2 of the rustic brown. I needed 2 more, but they ran out. So we ordered 2 taller ones. 4 kids, 4 dressers. The kids are thriller with having a dresser! We can't have wood ones because we live in an 1890's house, no room to get them up skinny stairs and doorways. This works, they are much better than cubbies. They are strong drawers but flexible, nice hard front. Putting together was fun. Had to turn the top around once. If you lay it all out and think about how it will end up, minimal mistakes will be made putting it together. The kids love having a plug in on top for a lamp. Sturdy dresser.",

All in all I\u2019m not too disappointed with the product but it\u2019s definitely something I plan on replacing within the next 2-5 years. Might be a good option for young kids or single young adults who just need quick affordable furniture.",
