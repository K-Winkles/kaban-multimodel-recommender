                "reviewText": "Just got it in today and pot it together. Easy to put together. The frame is sturdy and has cross bars in the back for extra support. The drawer fronts look like wood but I think it's for like balsa wood. However, the drawers are cloth. Harder wood top so you can place breakable on it with no issues. I'm loving it. Totally recommend if you need more drawer space with limited space in your home.",

I love the color and will buy a bigger one for his room when he's a bit older. I am so glad this was easy and quick to set up because I'm normally not great at setting things up. The Furnulem Tall Dresser with 6 Drawers is something I would buy again!",

Even worse it's not a woven fabric (like canvas), it's pressed together and paper-like (non-woven). I cannot imagine what the drawers could hold without sagging one into the other or getting holes punched in them. Not worth $5, let alone the >$50 that's being charged for it.I unfortunately waited too long to open the box to assemble it otherwise it would have gone straight back!",

The instructions were very simple and gave both written and picture instruction for each step. The only disappointment is on 2 drawers the material used for the face of each drawer was not pulled tight. And 1 drawer there are 2 marks, almost cuts but on the surface only, on the drawer face. (You can see in the picture.) But, for what I am using this for I don\u2019t think it was worth sending for a replacement. And it\u2019s not going to be in a location where it can be seen by guests. Overall I am happy with it.",

Comes with everything you need and even a few extra screws. The only issue I have is one of my drawers seems to have a break in it because if I try to straighten the top, you can hear it snapping back-and-forth like something in there is broken. Another drawer has ripples behind the vinyl that I can\u2019t get smoothed out. I have one in our entryway that is completely fabric with finger holes to open the drawers that I prefer. These handles on this model are pretty small for normal human fingers. One I have in my closet is also completely fabric drawers with cute wooden handles. Both I purchased on here with this one being my least favorite.",
