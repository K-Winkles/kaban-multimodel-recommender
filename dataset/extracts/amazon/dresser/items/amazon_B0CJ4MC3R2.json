I really like black oak color I got and it looks nice as well as it makes the drawers look more flush with the dresser and it feels strong, it shouldn't sag with heavy usage.The dresser fits a lot of clothes and toys and it is very functionable. The dresser is a metal frame with fabric baskets. The top and faces of drawers are a wood-like material. Its a specific style and not the classic wooden clunky dresser. I personally recommend attaching this to the wall if you have little kids.My old complaint is the awkward baskets on the side. I don't love the look and I find them awkward to reach inside them.Other than that I higher recommend this dresser and I find it functional and looks nice too.",

That being said, it is decently sturdy as long as you have it secured. It\u2019s a 2 person lift because it\u2019s decently weighted. I love that the drawers are those foldable kind, but the front of the drawers having the hard piece is wonderful because there is no bulge. I use it as a dresser so mine is loaded with clothes. It took about 1hr to assemble but mostly because you have to place the handles on yourself and that took the most time.",

It was pretty easy to put together and the instructions ruins were good. I like how they have the drawers looking like actual wood. This was a great buy that I highly recommend!",
