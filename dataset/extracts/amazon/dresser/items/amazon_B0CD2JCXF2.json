It's perfect for my 8 years old son. He uses partial to storage his own valuable items and Legos.Assembly was not hard but it's time consuming. The instructions was very clear and well illustrated. I used the manual hand too and it took me 2 hours to put together. It does need a lot of patience to put it together. It will be really fast if you have electronic too and it will speed up the installation process. Overall, good value and good quality.",

It feels relatively sturdy, but it definitely feels like if I'm not careful when opening it that I can cause it to topple over if I'm opening the drawers too quickly and strongly.But it's got a lot of storage space and it looks relatively nice as well for giving yourself some more storage to organize a bedroom or a closet with. Additionally while it's taller, the drawers aren't super long as they are wide so you can definitely fit this dresser into smaller spaces.",
