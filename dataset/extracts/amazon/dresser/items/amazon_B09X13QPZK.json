                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars easy to assemble, good for lightweight items",
                "reviewText": "First off, this is super easy to assemble. It took me an hour to put together the whole thing - including dragging the box up the stairs, unwrapping everything, and going back downstairs to get my toolkit. Not only is it straightforward, but all the pieces and screws are different enough that you won't mix them up. I actually took all the numbers off the pieces without thinking, and had no issues figuring it out (with one exception, two bars that are pretty similar - but a quick look at the diagram cleared it up, plus it only matters if you're planning to attach the dresser to the wall). It technically comes with everything you need, although the manual recommends a Phillips head screwdriver and I agree, it's a lot easier than using the screwdriver part of the included Allen wrench.One of the pieces was actually damaged when I opened the box; the metal was pretty badly bent out of shape. I contacted customer service but I was impatient so I tried just hammering it flat myself, which worked fine. Although it gives instructions and hardware to attach it to the wall, I decided not to do that - it really isn't all that easy to tip over, and my daughter is old enough that I can trust her not to climb on it, but if it was going in a younger kid's room it would probably be a good idea.The finished product looks nice and is taller than I expected (my fault, not paying close attention to the dimensions). I'm using it for my 10 year-old's clothes, and it's great for that; the drawers are pretty shallow but they're the perfect depth for her shirts when folded normally. I'd need to fold my shirts smaller to fit, which would mean fewer items would fit overall. She likes that it's more \"grown up looking\" than the small wooden dresser she's had since she was a baby, and I like that it's pretty inexpensive.Based on the price and description, you should have a good idea of what this is - the drawers are fabric, so they can't hold heavy things, and you shouldn't put anything heavy on top of it. It's actually sturdier than I'd imagined it would be - the frame is solid metal, the top is sturdy wood, and there are lots of cross beams for extra support, plus many of the bars attach in multiple spots so it doesn't wiggle at all. The drawer fronts have some sort of particle board inside them so they're solid and don't fold or pull weird when you open them, like all-fabric drawers do. There are solid/stiff inserts for the drawer bottoms so they hold their shape. They also have real handles that attach with screws vs a fabric pull handle, which makes it look nicer and more finished. It's relatively lightweight (especially compared to a solid wood dresser) but not easy to tip over. The feet don't glide so it's not easy to move without lifting, but I think that's probably better than having it slide all over the place.",

It was easy to put together. This unit has changed the entire look of our closet because now it is organized and pretty. The drawers are functional for medium to lightweight items. I now have a drawer for the dog leashes and anything dog related, a drawer for light bulbs, a drawer for my steam mop pads, a drawer for mailing supplies, and much more. Anyway, I would say if you're debating whether or not to buy this storage dresser, do it. You will find it extremely useful.",

There is lots of space - I had a four drawer wooden dresser before this and I love this one much more. It is lighter, easier to hold and fill, and way more roomy! Very fun to organize based on the drawers (especially the top three) and I love the color and clean look. Super easy to dust and wipe down and clean as well. The handles are plastic but easy to screw on, they give you one extra. If anything happens, it is surely an easy replacement as these types are very common. Definitely worth the buy, especially if you come across any discounts.",
