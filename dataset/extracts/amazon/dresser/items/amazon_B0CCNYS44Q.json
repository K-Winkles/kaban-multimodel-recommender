The pictures included are with and without flash, I also did spray paint the handles matte black because I personally like it better than the copper color.The nightsands and dresser took about an 1 hour each to put together super simple just needs a drill to make it quicker. So far feels very sturdy and durable, will update if needed.",

                "reviewText": "This product was packaged very nicely and even came with a few spare parts. It did take time to assemble, though - about two hours for each bedstand. The directions are very clear, but there is a lot to assemble and the rails that you attach to the drawers MUST be screwed down evenly and flush or the drawers will catch when you try to close them. And the screws are very small. You will need to use some muscle to screw all of the items together as you cannot use electric tools - they would quickly strip the screws. But - once the pieces are together, you will be pleased with your purchase. Again - a nice piece of furniture that should hold up well.",

                "reviewText": "This dresser is beautiful and absolutely stylish. I loved the height as I have a bed that is pretty high, the hight was perfect & I no longer have to reach down to grab items from my dresser. And each drawer has significant storage space.Assembling this dresser is an absolute pain. Similar to other reviews, it\u2019s nearly impossible to assemble the dresser without a power drill. A handheld screw driver will have you screwing until next year. It\u2019s very annoying so much so that I purchased two dressers and after assembling the first one, I didn\u2019t have the capacity to do the second one. That\u2019ll be a job for tomorrow.Again, I LOVEEEEEE the end result but getting there, was a hassle and a headache.Also, two of my pieces came a bit damaged. Neither piece is visible once the dresser was complete so it wasn\u2019t a big deal but certainly with noting.UPDATE; the seller contacted me and helped resolve my issue with my damaged pieces. Exceptional customer service so I\u2019ll definitely be purchasing from them again! Speedy and helpful support.",

                "reviewText": "It turns out that it\u2019s nothing but MDF covered with a thin layer of wood-like printed plastic - even the drawer fronts! While the price is attractive, the product description is deceptive; \u201cWood Storage Dresser\u201d is inaccurate unless you count glue and sawdust (MDF) as wood. Do yourself a favor and avoid this product if you want a piece of wooden furniture. Even if you are happy with the price for this plastic-covered MDF then I wouldn't trust a company based in China that is also willing to deceive like this to do the right thing if this product doesn't work out as you expect.",
