I did have a minor issue with one of the drawers being damaged - there was a small defect from the inside of the dresser that slit the side of the drawer when I pulled it out. I contacted Amazon and since it was already assembled by the time I noticed the defect, they gave me a partial refund for the inconvenience (I preferred keeping it over disassembling it and returning). Overall, very happy with my purchase and might purchase one more for our living room.",

Best description I can come up with is like...radioactive cinnamon.That's said: these are perfect for a dresser for little girls. We spray painted the wooden handles gold, and she loves that the drawers are light weight and there's no risk of smashed fingers. Downside is obviously they can pull them all the way out and make a mess but that's inevitable regardless. Getting another one to replace what our other daughter already has. They are also sturdy enough and low enough I'm not worried about them wanting to climb on the top to look out the window.",

People complaining about the size need to find a tape measure, it\u2019s exactly as described. You need to pay attention when assembling because it\u2019s easy to get a part turned in the wrong direction. I replaced the drawer pulls - any 3.75 inch ones should do, but keep the short screws! 10/10 love this dresser.",
