These bags are ideal for storing wedding gowns, bridesmaid gowns, prom dresses, pageant gowns, leathers, dresses, suits, and furs. The grommet on the bottom can be looped over a hanger for easy transport. These bags keep stored items safe from dust particles and will preserve them in their true form for generations.",
