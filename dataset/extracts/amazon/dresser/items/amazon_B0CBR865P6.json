The only real complaint I have is that if you have baseboards, you can\u2019t really use the wall anchors without tipping the dresser back, which is probably about as unsafe as not having wall anchors. I put the dresser in my kids\u2019 room but fortunately they\u2019re old enough to understand why they can\u2019t climb on it. The drawers are a bit flimsy and probably wouldn\u2019t hold very many adult-sized clothing items because they\u2019re not very deep but they\u2019re perfect for my kids\u2019 clothes. It looks nice and wasn\u2019t too difficult to assemble alone.",
