They include multiple steps for directions on one page so you have to pay good attention to make sure everything is put together correctly. It came with all of the needed hardware and hex tools to put it together. It\u2019s sturdy and will help us a ton to have extra storage. The drawers hold a decent amount of weight and work great to keep my daughter\u2019s toys in. The outlet is easy to install on it and a very nice feature. I plan on putting a lamp on the top left portion. I like that the lower part where i show pictures has a back wall so the frames can\u2019t fall off of the back.",
