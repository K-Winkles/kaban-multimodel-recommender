Also yes.That said, know what you're buying.This is pretty much a nick-knack set of drawers. It's small. It's great if you have a bunch of loose things that you want to organize. That is what I bought it for. Arts and crafts stuff, electrical cords, and other random things.If you're looking for a clothing drawer, it's not really going to work. There just isn't a lot of space.It's cheap because it's small, but it's not offensively, small. It is functional. I give it 5 stars based on value for money. It's sturdy when assembled correctly. DO NOT expect fancy furniture though.It also takes probably a good 2-3 hours to put together, so be prepared for that.",

Don\u2019t assembly them all first.Many reviews mention using a drill, but with the exception of anchoring it to the wall, that feels super unnecessary to me. I did it all with a Phillips head.It is much smaller than I anticipated, but that\u2019s on me for not double checking. It\u2019s pretty and seems durable. Overall, I think it\u2019s a win.",

                "reviewText": "The instructions to put the dresser together are unclear, but you can figure it out. The dresser is sturdy, and I don\u2019t have a major issue with it. The biggest issue is that the dresser comes with a big sticker that is on the top of the dresser. This was not in any images of the product, and looked very bad when I put the dresser together. After removing the sticker, the dresser is covered in adhesive residue, which has been nearly impossible to completely remove. The top of the dresser looks horrible because of this, and remains very sticky. I have purchased Goo gone and will try that out, but this dresser is far more trouble than it is worth.",
