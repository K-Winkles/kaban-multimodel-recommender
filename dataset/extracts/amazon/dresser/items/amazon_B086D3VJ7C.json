Details are also particularly good, the corner of the cabinet is round, don\u2019t afraid of accidentally hit. The top one layer has two smaller drawers, receive small article conveniently. It is also convenient to install only you follow the instructions.It's not the cheapest cabinet,But it must be the best value of money.All in all, it's a very satisfying product,GET IT!",

                "reviewText": "OKAY!!!! After 6 hours trying to assemble this is my opinion: solid however drawers are not as deep as I prefer, should be 5 drawers instead for more room. Instructions SUCK!!! The bracket position is hard to determine since they don\u2019t indicate which direction to put them. I of course had them backwards. Then once I had them right I thought just one more screw for them to attach the drawer WRONG!!! This was the worse part the screw is BARELY long enough to catch. I have put together lots of IKEA & Walmart pieces & I have never had such a difficult time with assembly. If it wasn\u2019t the perfect size for the space needed I would have given up & returned it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I really liked this dresser, it took me a few hours to put it together as the instructions were only pictures and some of them can be easily mixed up, so I had to re-dp a couple of steps bc I got them \"up side down\" but overall not too bad. The side, up and down panels are solid and could be heavy to move, which makes it worth the price (not your regular cheap made-up-wood). Sadly, the upper right small drawer doesn't close well bc the way it's built (the holes of the rails are more forward compared to the left side) but it doesn't look too bad. That's why I gave it only 4/5 stars.",
