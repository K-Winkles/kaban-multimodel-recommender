                "reviewText": "I bought two of these for my kids\u2019 new apartment. I made the decision purely due to next day shipping since I won\u2019t be here long.Let\u2019s get one thing out of the way. This is not a real furniture. The are 6 fabric boxes in a wood and metal frame. The top is quite solid, side is thin. The drawers are designed only to hold light items, ideally clothing. But for the price and speed of delivery, it is not bad.Another thing, this is a Chinese modular furniture. It comes with numerous parts and numerous hardware. Slow down and double check each step when you build it. If only fits one way. Too me two hours to build the first one, 45 minutes to build the second. I made mistakes with each. The most crucial step is make sure all the rails for drawers are facing the correct direction",

It is not at all sturdy as the description states, it is very flimsy. I knew the drawers were fabric but I thought the front of the drawer was wood based off the photos not wood design printed on fabric. Very tackyThis dresser was also very time consuming to put together. My boyfriend put it together to surprise me and I wish I would have unboxed and told him not to waste his time.",

It looks really good but is very cheap, considering this was $120 I did not notice that it had cloth drawers. The angle in the picture on here makes it look bigger than it is. My picture shows you just tiny it looks on a wall. this might be good for children's room but not for adults. It's not sturdy and wobbles a lot. I don't see it lasting too long.Update: I was contacted by the seller after I posted this, and they offered me a discount. I accepted the officer. I was not going to take the time to take it apart and ship it back. I am very pleased with the quickness of their reply and the willingness to offer something back to make my displeasure better. It worked. I am changing my one start to a 3 star. I still have not started using this yet. Stars might change again once I see how it will hold my clothes.",
