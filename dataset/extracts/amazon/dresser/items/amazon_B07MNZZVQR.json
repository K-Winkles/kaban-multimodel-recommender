                "reviewText": "This is a high quality, nicely designed piece of furniture that is easy to assemble and versatile in usage. We currently live in an apartment and have been moving around. So we were looking for a dresser that is light weight, of less hassle in case we move again, and yet still able to perform well to the purpose. We found this one! The dresser is stable and sturdy. The fabric drawers/boxes are spacious for storing shirts, pants, towels or bedding linens--however you want it (of course you need to fold the items first--and I would recommend the kon mari way which helped me a lot!). We also love the smooth-feeling wooden handles. They definitely elevate the feel of the dresser to the more elegant expensive side. The height of the dresser compares to that of a normal desk. I placed it right next to my IKEA desk in the bedroom and use the surface as a little extension of my desk surface--which is always covered with books and papers. Some of those items are now neatly piled up on the dresser! One could also place the dresser comfortably in the closet. Despite all this wonderfulness the only little nuisance I have found so far is you can't leave a drawer hanging when pulled out like a normal wooden drawer. Somehow you need to hold it with the handle and take things from it by the other hand. The drawer can still balance about 1/3 pulled out, more than that it tends to tumble. Just be careful about this.",

It is very sturdy and all the pieces were in perfect condition. It holds a lot more clothing than I anticipated it being able to, which is a good thing! The drawers are not perfect, you do have to adjust a little if you want them to all be the same when closed, but it's nothing I would really complain about. The colors and measurements were exactly as described as well. Very happy with this purchase!",

CONS: I had to drill a couple of extra holes in order to put it together the way the directions said. I guess the non-holes were missed during inspection?? It's not very sturdy, depending on what you are going to use it for. Not sturdy enough for a kids room or office files. Good for socks and t-shirts and such.",

Sliding drawers are heavy fabric with a solid bottom section. Great for storing many items. Will be sliding leg casters on steel feet to kelp it move and slide. Well worth the price, cannot go wrong with this piece. The drawers sometimes don't go in even but a very small issue.",

                "reviewText": "This is such a cute dresser and perfect size to put in my closet, but am a little disappointed that I can't fully use it. I am not able to use the top two drawers on the right side because the right stand is the same as the left. There are no matching holes to insert the shelves. Also, there were no assembly instructions. Even though it was easy to assemble, it would still be nice to have instructions, as the whole time my husband and I were thinking we had assembled it incorrectly when it was really just packaged wrong. It also looks like we may have received a returned packaged, because one of the bags with all the bolts/screws was already ripped open when we opened up the box.",
