Each different piece had a letter assigned & printed on the plastic pack & then that letter was clearly indicated in the diagram of the instructions. I was able to put it together stress-free! It is really sturdy. I don't have kids so i don't feel the need to attach it to the wall. It is not made for heavy items in any event. The leatherette fronts & gold handles really make the item look great. It is really good quality, well made & sturdy.",

I decided to order another one to organize another area, and that one was missing different screws than the previous unit. To top it off it doesn\u2019t seem level.Oh and I almost forgot, on the second go around, (when I received the replacement) there were imperfections such as tears on the interiors of two drawers.On the additional (third) unit, there\u2019s a big imperfection on the outside of one drawer and one on the inside of another drawer.This is very much you get what you pay for vibes. It works, if you\u2019re putting it somewhere out of site like a closet, its very doable.It does the job. The drawers are decently deep and wide, the handles are sturdy and the drawers seem sturdy enough.If you\u2019re looking for something sans headache and actually checked for quality assurance I recommend finding something else!",

There were no way to place the top board on without drilling new holes, so I repackaged it and returned it. Didn't want to bother with getting replacement parts. I sent it back and seller reached out to me. Told him I've sent it back, however, he insisted that he will send me one for the trouble out of his pocket. I told him it wasn't necessary, but he insisted. It came, and the box was a little damaged, not as bad as the first time.This time the product was in good shape and everything fitted as it should. The product works fine, and I really appreciate Jaden for reaching out and offered this dresser. Product is good, customer service is top notch.Thanks",

This dresser size stated would have been perfect as a night stand, however it is not accurate at all. We were very disappointed in size. We account for mis measurement by 1-2 inches but we ordered two and both are the exact same height and not near the manufacturers measurements listed.The draws are nice and it would be a great dresser if the measurements weren\u2019t so off.
