As the price would suggest, it is not a luxury item, but it looks very nice for what it is.I had issues with damaged parts in shipping, and customer service was AMAZING in helping me to make sure I got everything I needed so reach out!Assembly was long, but I am no expert and was able to do it alone in one afternoon. With two people, it shouldn't be too difficult.It took some time with the damaged parts, but I am very happy with the result!",

                "reviewText": "This item took a very long time to make. It took me four hours total. This is due to all the drawers I had to assemble. However, when fully assembled, the drawers, the shove test, the pushing it around the bedroom test passed with flying colors. The drawers come out smoothly and does not shake when I open my drawers too harshly and closes just fine. The drawers do not have the anti-slam glides but its smooth enough to not care. Could have hoped the drawer space was bigger. You can probably fit five large rolled up sweats in one drawer without having problems.The rating is for the piece of the furniture I broke during assemble. There is a very awkward phase of the build, where you have to upright the item. make sure to do this by grabbing the edges and not the small unattached pieces. Otherwise, it will break off and you will have a ruined item. My break was clean enough and small not to notice. But when you rip out a screw by force, it shows. The damage shows and looks like a bullet hole. You won't notice it unless you know where to look though. However, I know where it is. Got over it, good enough to pass all the stability tests so I am happy.",
