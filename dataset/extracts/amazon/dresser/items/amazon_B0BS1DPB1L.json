                "reviewText": "The pictures online had it looking like a match to my other furniture. It was close, so that worked and the dresser was a good size for my needs.The bad part?Screws and bolts were missing, draw pulls were cheap plastic knobs, the piece for the back of the dresser was flimsy cardboard, the holes for the screws were not drilled correctly and it took 3 hours to build and was flimsy when I stood it up. Not sure what I can put on top but don't know that it can hold the weight of my television. The drawers were also very difficult to get on the track and align to fit into the dresser.I am using it for now but if I had to do it over again, I would look for something else.",

                "reviewText": "This is exactly what I needed. Great little dresser when you consider the price. Very basic. Fairly easy to put together for one person. Fits beautifully inside my small closet. Three nice spacious drawers that open and close well. There is nothing fancy about this dresser and you are getting materials that reflect the price. But I could not be happier with this purchase.",

Its not made from any good materials so its expected. Ill give it maybe one to one and a half years before it makes its way to keep us warm in the fire pit!",
