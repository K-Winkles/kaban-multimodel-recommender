I contacted Amazon and they told me I could PAY to return the dresser to them and get a refund for the remaining after shipping or I could contact the manufacturer. I contacted Storkcraft and sent them the necessary info immediately. Two long weeks later the pieces arrived. We went to assemble it and the new pieces are too short. I contact them AGAIN. Their warranty department told me to disassemble the dresser, ship it back to Amazon and order a new one \u201cif I wanted faster service\u201d. I call a now FOURTH time regarding this purchase and I\u2019m told that they will send out new parts and \u201chopefully they will fit\u201d but they cannot expedite shipping or priority and we\u2019re not sympathetic. Do not do business with this company. They do not care to have it. It is BY FAR the WORST customer service experience I\u2019ve had. Shame on Storkcraft and shame on Amazon for expecting me to pay shipping to return a DRESSER that arrived broken.",
