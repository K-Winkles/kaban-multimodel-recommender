This an easy drawer set to put together took about the exact 80 min predicted to put it together as a whole. The inside drawer screws that connect to the railings that help pull the drawers out were hard to align and get in it took quite a few tries but they went in. Overall love the drawers hold quite a bit and are a smooth pull out and push in would defined order a second one!",

I have tried everything including vinegar.,ZORBX, OZIUM and even gone as far as caulking and painting the drawers thinking it would seal the odor in. No use the odor is still there! It smells like something crawled in and died in the cabinet. I called Amazon and it\u2019s outside the return window they cannot help me. I have to contact the seller. I think this is $149 just wasted because I cannot keep this in my house and I don\u2019t have faith that the seller is going to help me.

                "reviewText": "It is a solid piece, lots of wood. However, my problem is that the interior drawer measurements are not as listed. It says they are 13+in deep, but they are closer to 11\u201d inside. I figured I was not careful reading and it was actually saying the depth from the front of the outside to the back of the outside, but that doesn\u2019t even really reach 13 inches either. I\u2019m just annoyed bc I searched high and low to find one that would have tall enough drawers to fit something specific, now they\u2019re not deep enough.",
