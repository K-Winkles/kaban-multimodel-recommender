Was able to fix it but definitely be careful. Took a long time to build but I love it, just be sure to put the drawers on the right side. Love the detailing. Matches all my other furniture (:",

So not okay.it great but, prepare yourself.",

Its not a heavy duty piece but it does the job and it looks as pictured but i am disappointed in the quality of this product. Its very cheap and the drawers are too light. They dont shut well and dont hold heavy items.",

It was a bit time consuming to put together but it\u2019s not hard at all if you follow the instructions!My only complaint is that it probably won\u2019t last more than a year. I already have to be pretty careful with opening and closing the drawers just right so they don\u2019t get stuck. I think for a guest room, this item is great but for a main bedroom where you\u2019re using it everyday - not the best idea.",

The price is great, it was easy to build, but it is not real wood, of course. It's in our guest room so it won't be used much, so I think we'll get more use out of it than someone who would use it everyday. But, I do feel like it was a sturdy build so should last others a good while as well. I was very impressed with the packaging, nothing was damaged at all in the delivery process.",

                "reviewText": "I took a gamble on this as there weren't a ton of reviews. I am so happy with it! We got it for the nursery. It is HEAVY in the box. But my husband got it up the stairs on his own. Took him a few hours to put together with all the pieces but it was easy.For those saying the drawers don't line up, read the instructions. My husband thought the same thing but the drawers have a certain side they go on, not all interchangeable.It was left in the rain in our driveway all day, the box was soaked. But nothing was ruined!!Haven't added anything to it, but I think for little baby clothes it will work perfectly. We plan to add a changing table on top. We aren't too tall, I'm 5'2\" and my husband is 5'8\" so I don't think it's too short for us.The drawers open and close easy but are not \"quiet\" like I've seen other dressers say. There are spots to hook it to the wall so it doesn't fall.Overall I'd definitely recommend this! It feels good quality so think it should last, even if it gets us a few years for our little one it will be worth it.",
