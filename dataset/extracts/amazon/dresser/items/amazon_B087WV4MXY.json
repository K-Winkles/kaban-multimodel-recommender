It's my whole little \"world\" right here at my fingertips. Highly recommend; definitely worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "I have the black version of this item and use it daily. I ordered this one for my bedroom and while its the same design as the first the lighter color fabric has an odor while the black one I have does not. I am taking one star away for that reason. Maybe it was just that particular unit I received. I sent it back but will likely try again. I use the other one I have to store all my digital drives and tech related supplies. Its study enough to hold a small lamp. You have to be a little careful rolling on carpet but overall it works great for a basic storage unit. Note that the drawers are fabric so not as robust as a wooden dresser so you have to treat them carefully. They simply pull directly in and out.",
