                "reviewText": "It may look like I am the first to review so I will try and give as much detail as possible so it could potentially be helpful.First, I kept coming back to this dresser (I call it credenza for my purposes) even though I don\u2019t order items with no reviews. But for the price, the esthetic and the purpose I was using it for, this appeared to be enough checks on my list that I took a chance.First- it was delivered on time. Thank you! I live in an upstairs unit. While the delivery driver didn\u2019t get it upstairs he got it in my building. The box is going to be slightly shorter than my height of 5\u20195 and it is HEAVY. I was able to pulley it up the stairs but it took me 15 to 20 minutes to get it up by myself and my biceps and quads were burning.Once inside, I opened the box. The box had all parts, no cracks, scratches or damage on all parts. Well packaged and cushioned so they wouldn\u2019t rub and scratch other parts. The instructions are long and had several pages, there are a lot of steps. The instructions did not entail what tools would be needed. I waited to assemble until my dad could come help. It took him around 4 hours to assemble and he used power tools, if you use the tool they give it will probably take longer.Onto the actual product- I love it! It was exactly as pictured minus the glass panels are darker as the drawers on inside are black and not featured is the middle bar on bottom of dresser. See last photo on this review as it will change the look slightly and if you are particular it may or may not be a deal breaker. Very sturdy. The middle bottom leg that adds extra support for the bottom and structure matches the legs.The drawers are deep enough for a single row of shoes but probably not enough room to stack shoes on top of each other unless they are flats, sandals etc. the top drawers pull out 75 percent of the way. They won\u2019t pull out to where they come out, which means if you\u2019ve shoved something in the very back you\u2019ll need to reach your hand in to find it. It fits what I wanted. Top drawers hold small purses, plenty of space for sunglasses and accessories. I even was able to Stowe away my big tote bag I use twice a week. Hope the review helps.",
