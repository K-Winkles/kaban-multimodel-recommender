                "reviewText": "I don't know what most people expect from this general category of furniture. My expectations are:moderately attractive,very sturdy,and not too difficult to assemble.This dresser hits all three.Let's face it, it isn't nice wood furniture. But then it doesn't have that price point either. The collapsible fabric drawers have fronts that are solid with handles and are nice looking. The two horizontal surfaces are about what you might expect -- solid, smooth, clean.It is sturdy. This is improved by the addition of cross braces on the back to keep the piece from racking. Not all furniture in this category has this structural feature.Assembly took me a while but I'm \"advanced in years\" and it was a bit difficult for me to get down on the floor at times. Still, I managed to put the frame together in under an hour. A friend put the handles on the drawers for me while I did the frame.The end result is a not too heavy, very sturdy, clean and attractive piece of storage furniture that I hope to have in the house for years to come. The only thing I might have wanted to add is casters...",

The screws for the handles looked a little flimsy, I would not use just to be safe. Using for storage, it holds a lot of items, even heavier items. Looks neat in the room.Good value.",

The dresser is light weight. Just feel it\u2019s not as sturdy as I would like it to be. Once my granddaughters baby is born and is a toddler crawling around will definitely have to screw it safely to wall which it came with tools to do so. Otherwise I like the look at least and decent size. My daughter has more space now in her room.",

It works great and Amazon carries so many furniture items to match the designs.",

It\u2019s just tall enough that my 2 yr old wouldn\u2019t reach their tv or anything that is put on top off it. It even comes with a little kit to screw the dresser into the wall for child safety. Which is a big plus because I have a climber. Would most definitely purchase again and for my room as well.",
