                "reviewText": "This is my 5th WLIVE piece of furniture. It's easy to assemble; as one reviewer stated, the drawer brackets were the hardest part. I have 2 night tables, a single width 4 drawer stand, the 5 drawer TV stand and now this 10 drawer dresser.I'm a very fit 74 year old with a really fluffy cat. I like to vacuum under everything. When I do a deep clean vacuuming, it's so easy to pop out the drawers of these units, and carry the frame away from the wall. No cat hair hiding under or behind these units.The other thing I love about the brand WLIVE is the fact that the company ALWAYS sends extra parts for their units. I don't think that there is anything more frustrating than getting something half built, and finding that you are missing parts. I''ve been down this road, and it's a waste of time disassembling your work, repackaging it and doing a return. I have never had to do this with my WLIVE furniture.If you need a new dresser, hall storage for hats, scarves and mittens in your hall, or are a crafter who needs to keep their supplies organized, this is the brand I would recommend. It's inexpensive, sturdy but sleek and elegant.Two thumbs up and 5 stars across the board for this line of furniture.",

The directions are pretty clear as long as you pay close attention to the letters of the different pieces. The drawers are very easy to pull out so this might not be good if you have small children.

                "reviewText": "Ordered for my bedroom to act as a dresser and night stand.I will start by stating that this product does not come in the best packaging, though I can say that, even though the box was slightly damaged (torn open on the corner), the product did not appear to be damaged at all.Assembly was pretty straightforward, and took about 20-25 minutes, but is mostly just tedious screwdriver work assembling the drawer handles. There is a combination hex key/phillips screwdriver that comes in the kit--do yourself a favor and throw this thing away immediately if you have your own tools you can use, as it will greatly speed up the assembly of this dresser.After assembly, the dresser was moved into place, and it looks pretty good, despite being fabric drawers; from a distance, you don't even notice that they're fabric.As for durability, time will tell, but it does seem durable enough to last a few years of normal use.For the price, this is a pretty good deal, so much so that I ordered a second one for other side of my bed, so that my husband and I would each have our own.If you're looking for an affordable, yet functional dresser, this may be what you're looking for.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Fabric Dresser and was thrilled with the quality and design of the product. The construction is sturdy, the drawers slide smoothly, and it provides ample storage space\u2014all in all, a fantastic addition to my bedroom.However, my excitement was slightly dampened when I received the dresser in white instead of the black I had ordered. While the error in color was disappointing, I must emphasize that the product itself is outstanding. The fabric finish adds a touch of sophistication, and the dresser complements my decor beautifully.Despite the color mix-up, I'm pleased with the purchase overall. If the correct color had been delivered, this would have easily been a five-star review. TI hope the company takes note of the color accuracy to prevent such discrepancies in the future.In conclusion, if you're willing to overlook potential color discrepancies and appreciate a well-made fabric dresser, this product is an excellent choice. Just be sure to double-check the color before getting your hopes up!",
