These match my bed frame well in color and it holds everything I want it to with ease.Please note because these are fabric and cardboard draws you can not stuff them. I'm an organizer and I can't stand when men do this. They get distorted and ugly. So if it can't fit find another way.These are for minimalists.They do have a smell but it does not transfer to clothes. They are sturdy and lightweight enough to move when vacuuming if you want to.",

The only issue I have is with the fabric drawers. they don\u2019t fit perfectly but, that\u2019s more of a nitpick. the bigger issue is the buttons to pull the drawers out are connected by a small screw in between the drawer but, because the drawers are fabric the screws don\u2019t hold very well. i\u2019ve already had one of the buttons fall off the first week I had it. In terms of dressers, it does what it needs to but, if you\u2019re willing to splurge on a nice dresser then this isn\u2019t for you.",

I took off 1 star because the assembly instructions are not the easiest to understand. You have to be able to interpret pictures and visualize the assembled pieces to not accidentally install a piece backwards (which I did and had to re-do). However, once put together, it serves the purpose for which it is intended and looks quite nice.",

Definitely recommend for small spaces or as an alternative to the traditional wood dresser.For an Amazon product, this is a pretty decent item. Easy to assemble, it\u2019s tall, and all the drawers are very nice. It\u2019s no sturdy oak wood dresser, but it does the job and it\u2019s very nice looking. It does come with an option to anchor it to the wall behind it.Overall excellent quality and value, well made and since is not bulky you can accommodate it anywhere, I\u2019m extremely happy with my purchase.I really love it! I\u2019m planning to buy another two for my big closet and family room.",

It's not sturdy at all. It's very top heavy, considering that the heaviest piece to the whole dresser is the flat board piece on top, that serves as the surface, or dresser top. It was fairly easy to put together, although the directions aren't very helpful. I was able to figure it out on my own. And I put it together myself. The dresser itself is fairly tall. I'm 5'3\" tall and it comes to about middle of my chest. But it's also very narrow, therefore causing it to be unsteady. The drawers are somewhat flimsy, but they have a good depth to them. So you can store quite a bit in them, I just wouldn't put anything heavy in them. The knobs on the drawers are probably the best quality part of the whole thing. I honestly would not recommend this product to anyone. Especially if your looking for sturdiness, quality, and value.",
