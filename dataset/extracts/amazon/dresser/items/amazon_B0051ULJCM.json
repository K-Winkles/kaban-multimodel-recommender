                "reviewText": "I picked out this dresser for a specific location in my room, which many may find odd that I out it in my closet. We downsized to a much smaller home last spring, and space is rather limited for furniture in my bedroom. The dimensions were perfect, and while timely to put together, the whole dresser went up with ease. Granted, I did get distracted by the TV a few times as I was putting it together.I was also concerned I would have trouble moving it into the closet, but it was not that heavy, and I was able to move it with minimal effort and by myself without the use of a furniture dolly. The drawers assembled quickly and slide properly into place. I did use a drill for many of the screws, though it is not required\u2014just offered ease of assembly.When I ordered it, I didn't realize that it came with the top two drawers having locks. We've been using one to keep personal documents in, and the other is filled with socks. Right now, so I don't lose the keys, they are just inside of the key holes. They are two separate sets of keys for each lock.The only drawback I have to say about this dresser is that the drawers are not super deep, nor do they have much depth. It really isn't the biggest issue, as I have been trying to downsize how many clothes I tend to use, but it has gotten stuck on the way I tend to fold my t-shirts, or if I stack too many pants on top of each other.All in all, I would say that it is worth the price, and it is a very sturdy piece of furniture.",

                "reviewText": "This dresser is a piece of crap. I\u2019m in college so putting together the money to even buy the dresser was a pain in the ass and then to get it and it just fall apart every time I try to use it was just a giant disappointment. Almost every single piece of wood has it\u2019s paint or sticker or whatever it is torn off or scratched or buffed probably from factory packing because the delivery was very sturdy and good. The body of the dresser was decently good to put together. The only thing that was bad about the body was the locking black plastic pieces. No MATTER how hard you hammer, you cannot get the plastic dowels to stick together. I dented some of the pieces of cheap wood by simply trying to build it, making the top bowed. The metal locking pieces are the biggest problem on the drawers and once again the plastic dowels. The only thing that I could do to save it was to screw a long screw into the side of the drawer to help it stay together and even then it just doesn\u2019t look good. You definitely cannot just put this together with a screw driver either, you NEED power tools unless you\u2019re the hulk. Half of the holes are not screwed in and half of the pieces where the holes were provided just made it splinter and break more. The drawers are not flush because the front is simply falling off. The locking screws are awful and break the second you pull the dresser drawer. The only halfway decent things are the locking drawers and the body portion. I would send it back and demand my money back but at this point it\u2019s just so much of a hassle to even take it apart and send it back. Do NOT waste your money on this piece of crap, especially if you\u2019re like me and were expecting a halfway decent piece of furniture that at least stays together when you go to use it. The problem with companies like this is they scam you out of your money by sending you the cheapest piece of wood and worst screws to work with and incorrect tool instructions as well.",

                "reviewText": "I like it. I've only had it a few weeks but so far so good. Everything arrived in perfect condition, nothing was damaged. WARNING!!! it has a lot of pieces to put together. I have put together A LOT of furniture so this was not hard nor the hardest thing I have put together, BUT a first timer will want to cry. The advantage of THIS dresser is the instructions are VERY detailed. Most instructions are vague or only a picture with pointing arrows. These instructions are assembly friendly. If you're a beginner, I would suggest to find something to keep the hardware in order, like the muffin tin I used, this is the first thing I do when assembling anything. It took a good 3 hrs to assemble, that includes inspecting every piece separating the hardware and snacks within arms reach.I would suggest having someone help with assembling the middle; It will be slightly difficult to install the planks to each end without help. You need a Phillips head screw driver and a hammer. You should not use a drill for the screws but I did for most the the assemble, you can mess up if you screw it too tight and split the wood but I do this a lot and know how to control the torque on the drill.The drawers are 27 inches wide (side to side) 13 inches long (front to back) and 4 inches deep.This dresser is pretty sturdy, it's just to hold clothing, it's not in a kids room, no one is going to climb on it.The top drawers with lock and key is cute --IT'S NOT A SAFE-- but if you have roommates or someone that will be mosey; this can be a deterrent. It would be obvious if someone tried to tamper with it.All and all it's a nice dresser but if this is your first time assembling this will take a long time and be frustrating.I would suggest it to a friend and help them put it together :)",
