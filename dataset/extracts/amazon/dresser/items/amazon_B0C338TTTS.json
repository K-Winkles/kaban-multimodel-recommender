I would\u2019ve given this a 5 star review, except several pieces arrived cracked. For what this is priced at, I wouldn\u2019t have expected any of these items to look the way they did. Some of the cardboard boxing was also busted open and several pieces were all over the place. I understand these things may happen during packing and transit, but for the price, I\u2019d expect bubble wrapping or something to pad and protect the items inside.Once pieced together, however, the dresser looks great. Sturdy. My husband and I were able to put this together in about 30-45 minutes!",
