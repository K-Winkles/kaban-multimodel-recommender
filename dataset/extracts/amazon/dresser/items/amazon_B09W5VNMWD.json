LOL There were so many parts to this dresser and when I saw I had to put together the drawers too, I about died - I gave up that day. Looked at it the next day and kept going. LOL By the third day, I started back up with putting this dresser together. Once I got into the swing of things, putting it together started to flow. By the time you've done one drawer, you won't need the directions for the rest - that's half the battle. Overall great buy, nice and sturdy too. Recommend!",

This is nice because you may make mistakes. Manual screwdriver makes it easier to unscrew, fix, and reassemble without damaging the furniture parts.2) Great price and relatively speedy delivery. Problem is room to go couldn't deliver our dresser after 6 months wait because Covid delayed everything. I didn't want to wait another 5 months.This dresser looks great, better price, and no hassle delivery.3) 6 drawers. 3 on left, and 3 on right. Thus, it's easy for my husband and I to divide the drawers. His on the left; mine on the right. No arguments.4) Be prepared to spend a few hours assembling this. Take your time reading the instructions. Read it several times if needed.I have a tendency to forget the pegs, so I spent additional time disassembling and reassembling the drawers.But the instructions are clear.I did assembled one drawer to make sure that I did put the sliding things correctly. (I didn't completely trust the manual, but most of the directions are correct. (Note, step 7 is board 16 not 15.All in all, we love it",

I originally purchased this dresser because it advertised deep drawers, and that\u2019s not the case. The drawers are small and barely fit anything. I was a bit disappointed by this. I am now considering returning it to get a larger option since my husband and I will be sharing the dresser. OR I might have to purchase another one for him to use\u2026 tough decision for sure. Hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "I was worried that for such a low price, I would receive a low quality item. I am pleased to say that is not the case! Everything was packaged securely, so no damaged pieces. Instructions were easy to follow and all the parts and hardware were clearly labeled. It did take me a couple of hours to do, but would probably take less if 2 people worked on it. I really love that the drawers have a support beam in the middle! A lot of dressers tend to sag in the middle so I'm glad not to have to worry!! Will definitely be buying additional items!!",

                "reviewText": "This dresser is ridiculous. It took me hours to put together, and the instructions are not the best. They\u2019re bare minimum visuals with very few directions. The pieces do not fit together how they should. I believe it\u2019s piece #14 (the bottom to the drawers) that\u2019s not cut to the right length. I had to trim them in order for the front of the drawers to lay flat. The material is cheap wood, which I expected, but it scratches, chips, dents, and shows hand/finger prints. Plus the stickers to label the pieces are visible when the dresser is put together, and when I tried to take them off, I scratched the wood.",
