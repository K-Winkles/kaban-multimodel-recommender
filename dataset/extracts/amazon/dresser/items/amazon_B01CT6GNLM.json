                "reviewText": "This dresser (although a pain to assemble) is exactly what I was looking for for our baby\u2019s nursery. It\u2019s the perfect size, and the construction is sturdy. Although some of the interior pieces are particle board, the majority of this dresser is solid wood, which is more than I can say for any other dressers I looked at in this price range. It truly is well worth the $250 I paid for it.I wanted to leave a review here because I went back and forth over whether or not I should take the risk on this dresser due to all the hit or miss reviews. I think one of the main problems that people were having with regard to the uneven drawers is that they need to be assembled differently depending on which side of the dresser they\u2019re being used for. You have to assemble half of them specifically for the right side and half of them specifically for the left side. Otherwise they WILL look wonky. If you take your time and follow the instructions, you shouldn\u2019t have a problem. Even though it took me seemingly forever to put this thing together, the finished product is beautiful. Just FYI \u2014 some of the bolts were very difficult (and borderline infuriating at times) to screw in by hand, and there were some that definitely took a lot of elbow grease to get screwed all the way in. This is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But aside from that, I didn\u2019t have any major issues. The tools that come with the kit are basic, but they get the job done. I know they say not to use power tools, but as long as you know what you\u2019re doing, it really does save a lot of time to use a drill to install the back cardboard panel as well as to assemble the drawers.One last thing to note is that the shipping for this product was excellent. At first, Amazon said that the dresser wouldn\u2019t ship for 1-2 months, but I got it in less than a week, which was awesome. Everything was packaged carefully, and I didn\u2019t have any issues with missing or damaged pieces. The shade of white matches the Delta crib we bought perfectly. It\u2019s a bright white, not off-white or cream.Sidenote \u2014 I swapped out the white wooden knobs it came with for brushed nickel knobs, and I think that added the perfect finishing touch. Super cute!",

                "reviewText": "Very glad I bought this dresser. Structure is solid wood, and it looks like it has multiple coats of paint. Very smooth finish. I put it together myself within a few hours, listening to music and taking it slow. Didn't even have to ask my husband to help move it into place after, though it's a heavy piece of furniture, since I could leave the drawers out until the last minute. There was only one confusing part in the instructions, where I couldn't tell which way a rail was supposed to face by looking at the drawing (the rail with a notch). Apparently this confused some other people, too. I installed it incorrectly and had to take it off and reinstall it facing the other way. For this reason, I'd say don't tighten the screws until you have the basic structure complete. Then go back and tighten all of them. Also, one small piece of wood (a little corner brace piece inside one drawer) had a crack in it, where it was pre-attached with a couple screws. Didn't seem to affect the strength at all, and wasn't visible when dresser was complete. I DID use a drill for some screws, though the instructions said not to. I just did it slow and careful so as not to strip the screws. Some other people had trouble with drawers not aligning, but I almost guarantee they stuck a R side drawer in a L side slot and vice-versa (they are put together differently and aren't interchangeable). You WILL want to play close attention to detail while putting this together. I'd almost give this dresser 4.5 stars for these minor issues, but the completed piece is so nice I have to give it 5 stars. And this dresser can fit all my child's clothes that don't hang in the closet. Very pleased!",
