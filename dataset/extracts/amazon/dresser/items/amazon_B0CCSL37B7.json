And being told that the parts that are damaged, they look like they were hit with a hammer. I may not be able to get. So I've got a half assembled dresser. That you can't send back as it's too heavy and no getting it back into a box. Service person is trying to get someone to make the pieces the two pieces part 21 and 23 that look like they were hit with a hammer. They are out of stock so he's trying to get them for me. I would not suggest getting this dresser.",
