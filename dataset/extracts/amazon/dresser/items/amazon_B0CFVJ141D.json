The assembly instructions leave some room for improvement as it's totally pictures, no verbiage and as such needs some addential marking such as top and bottom, direction facing. I am not a novice but still had to take it apart twice to get the guesswork correct. You can't always guess correctly which direction the picture means the piece is facing, some text or addition marking would assist. Overall, a great product but if you're a novice .... get some help.",

I have about 20 books on it and there\u2019s no bending in the shelves. I like that the back of the shelves have a small bar across them so things can be pushed to the back without falling behind the shelf. I have cats that jump all on it and knock things off all the time but the side table itself never wobbles. The color is very nice and the frame is solid metal and the shelves are wooden. It\u2019s a great option for a small bedroom, dorm room or just an entryway shelf.",

I had two bolts/nuts, the teeny tiny ones for a handle that are easy to thread badly. I could not fit these little nuts into the little bolts. Thus one drawer was without a handle. I wanted the bolts/nuts to match so I emailed Furologee to ask if I could get more from them. They asked for my receipt copy, my name and address and with no further to-do sent replacements to me. A public thank you.There are dozens of companies selling similar looking, possibly less expensive, furniture. However, I'm getting ready to buy two more matching pieces...from Furologee, a company that I trust.",

                "reviewText": "For a long while I've been searching for a new dresser to replace the one I had in the corner of my room, it was a night stand but had no space at all. I needed more space and storage. Originally I was gonna go for a different dresser that matched my actual night stand that's next to my bed but it was no longer available. So I had to look around again and came across this one and I actually liked the build instead of the original one I looked at. It has shelves on one side and dresser on the next. It is perfect in my room and actually looks nice, it made more space in my room and made it look more spacious. This item is skinny but has enough storage space and isn't too tall either. I still have one empty space for either books or clothing. The shelves and the top part of the dresser are made from wood while the boxes themselves are actually that fabric type of boxes. I thought it was going to be wood as well based on the images but they are fabric, but it isn't a problem for me but maybe for others it might. It still looks nice to me. Definitely worth the purchase and worth the wait.",
