When it\u2019s all put together it\u2019s quite light and easy to move around. The only difficulty was the screwing in you do have to use a bit of elbow grease but nothing to sweat over. Also it uses \u201ccam lock fastening system\u201d which can be frustrating to get to work but in the end it looks great and holds together so I\u2019m very happy with the purchase",

                "reviewText": "The finished product is very nice. The process of putting it together got frustrating at times. Building the center section is difficult, would recommend building with more than 1 person. Some of the pieces of the locking system were not long enough to secure. A few screws on the runners were hard to manually screw in which caused the drawers to catch and not close. This was fixed after a few tries, but made the assembly process longer.",

It\u2019s not a problem with the instructions, which are very easy to follow, but rather the construction of the dresser. The pre drilled holes don\u2019t completely line up sometimes, and some screws don\u2019t quite reach long enough to keep it as sturdy as it could be down the middle. It\u2019s nice for now, but I don\u2019t see it holding up for more than a couple of years.",
