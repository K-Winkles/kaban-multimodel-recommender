They ran along every wall space to have enough storage. Now I have found this and it's brother! Same depth as cube boxes but with a grown up look. The 2 I bought equal 30 drawers. The same amount I had in cubes but take less wall space. The black is true black not very dark grey. With the deep black color and wood handles they do not scream fabric dresser at frist glance. These are great. They feel sturdy and were easy to put together. The drawers feel solid too.",

A bit challenging to put together but you just have to be careful the rods are facing the correct direction. It\u2019s slimline, fits well into space I had in mind and the drawers feel sturdy and slide easily on the grid or can be removed for full access.",
