After organizing everything, from top to bottom as shown in the photo, my wife and two kids were able to assemble it in 3 hours without using any power tools.The manual is very straightforward. All the diagrams are accurate. The surface of the dresser and all the drawers included are smooth and well made. The drawer knobs and the hairpin legs are made of metal with a gold finish which added a touch of sophistication to the dresser.I initially purchased this for my daughters room but I it was very beautiful that my wife placed it instead in her walk-in closet. The dresser is sturdy and looks so much better than the usual Ikea or Walmart DIY dressers. The item is also packaged well and that there are no scratches or any damage on the exterior and interior parts of the whole dresser.My wife is very happy with this purchase and instantly elevated her basic wire shelving closet into something that looks custom made for a fraction of the price. She now has a place to organize her socks, underwear and folded clothes in one beautiful dresser that also provided a stylish accent to her closet.",

                "reviewText": "My 16-year-old daughter's first reaction on seeing the picture was \"Oh, that's so pretty.\" (see picture in her room). I personally think it has a sleek and modern appearance. The package arrived undamaged (a first for such a large package) and the components inside were well packaged (see picture).My daughter helped me put it together. It took about 75 minutes. We used a power screwdriver which definitely helped. The instructions were easy to follow. All the hardware comes in individual labeled packages (see red plastic in the picture).The engineering is well-done. The edges fit together with tight tolerances. The drawers are level and evenly spaced (not found in most other DIY furniture). This compares well with that major Swedish store furniture well-known for its DIY kits. The solid stability and ample load-bearing capacity make it a reliable and versatile furniture piece. The drawers are spacious.A minor flaw is that we had to remove some gummy sticker residue from one of the drawer fronts.Recommend!",

                "reviewText": "The dresser is beautiful but it is definitely not very spacious. The drawers are tiny, I wish they would go all the way to the back of the dresser as they end around 4 inches before the back. Drawers are 11 inch and the dresser's depth is 15 inches, so maybe it could have a better way of optimizing the space. If you have a lot of clothes you'd like to store, I would recommend buying a different one.the assembly took me around 3 hours and some of the parts were very difficult to assemble and they didn't quite fit well with each other. The holes are marked but they're not puctured and you have to do so while assembling.Good thing is that it fits great into my closet so it is helpful and a good addition but would probably not buy again.",
