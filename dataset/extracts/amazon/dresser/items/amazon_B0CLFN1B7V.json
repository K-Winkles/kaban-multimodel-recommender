                "reviewText": "In my bedroom I sometimes find myself rearranging the furniture for the ultimate space saving and space utilization. While the cardboard drawers are light weight, I wouldn't expect to overwhelm the drawers with too weight. As the drawers are held on by bars with no center support. The the LED effects is a simple LED strip with double sided adhesive so it's up to you to pick it he optimal location for the best effect; just plug into an available USB whether it's the one supplied or into a separate location. The remote is self explanatory but lacks modes like simple transitions like fade to color or marquee style. The overall construction is simple and one e you figure out what screw goes to what you'll be able to figure it out without the instructions. The build itself feels sturdy gives off a premium look and feel.While I have this in my bedroom this would definitely save space in an small office or dorm. The description says it holds up to a 50inch I have a 55inch Neo QLED TV set with a centeree base and it works great.",

They give you a double sided Phillips head and Flat head bit that you put into the handle. Which is only used at the end when of the installation. Could've added the right bit for the job.The feet that goes onto the stand where all there except for the 1 screw hole that wasn't made right. After a few times of trying to screw it in, I took it out and the picture shows why. They never made the part right.There's a couple of holes missing on one of the metal brackets that I had to leave blank until I can get the correct drill bit to fix it myself. Several of the holes that was actually there didn't line up to the actual hole in the other part. So hole A didn't line up to hole B.I wouldn't recommend this product. Quality from them is low and it's not functioning the way that it was designed for.",
