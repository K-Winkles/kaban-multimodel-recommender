                "reviewText": "First off let\u2019s start with the tools you\u2019ll need because I didn\u2019t see anyone go over that.You will need : 1 Phillips screw-driver & a mini one (small)The dress is about 76-79 pounds so please be careful. It is sturdy though!Instructions are interesting. The most time consuming one was STEP 11. If you get help that\u2019s great! If not, you got this! It takes patience just take your time!Now let\u2019s go to the actual review : Honestly from reading the reviews, most people only spent 2 hours working on this. However, if you\u2019re like me, someone who wants others to build things and doesn\u2019t know much about tools but had to do it themselves, this took A LONG TIME (ex : 5-7 hours).It is also huge. I\u2019m not sure why some of the reviews say that it\u2019s small. I guess it depends on the person plus I\u2019m in a 1 bedroom apartment if that helps. It does take up a lot of space which I was a bit surprised of, but I did make it work!Thanks to The Real Housewives franchise I was able to accomplish this myself in 7 hours. Of course I did take a break to eat chocolate cake.It honestly looks fantastic and I am proud of my accomplishment! The picture doesn\u2019t do it justice (btw the sun is just shining on it)I hope this helps for anyone who is looking for a dresser!",

                "reviewText": "I have redone all my home furniture and bought lots of new items, everyone required from 20 minutes to a couple of hours to assemble. I am handy and used to this, but this furniture it's impossible, more than 200 screws it's just insane and even following the instructions I had to re-do the work 3 times, in the end realising that some instructions are confusing. I understand there could be a small company behind and feel sorry for them, but if you guys are not ready to approach the market take more time and fix your items because you can't waste other people time. The item isn't stable, one of the drawer is broken and evenif I tried to fix it, it won't work: really I got trapped, lost 6 hours time and will have to unscrew everything and send back. Very disappointed because I live 5 floors walk-up and to return this, it's really a burden. I will have to return anyway.",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent looking dresser but, it is not sturdy and the directions are not beginner friendly. You will need to take your time and look at the pictures several times. First, make sure all pieces are accounted for before you begin (that's common practice with any build) the low stars is fir the lack of direction. I am somewhat of an expert putting together pieces through years of experience. The directions fail to tell you that one set of drawers goes on the right and the other on the left. Figured that out myself. I also took off star for the materials. Enthroned other than the frame and drawer fonts are flimsy cardboard. I don't see this lasting long. Not the way my kids cram their clothes in.",
