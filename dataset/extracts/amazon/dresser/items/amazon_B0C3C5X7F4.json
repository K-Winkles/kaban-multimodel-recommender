Q2: What is assembly like? Easy/difficult? Most challenging parts? What tools are required and how many hands? A: Assembly is straightforward, but there are quite a few pieces which makes it SEEM more daunting. The six drawer boxes need to be assembled. You will need flat head and Phillips head screwdrivers and a hammer. One person can assemble this, but two will make it go faster! Put on some music and allow enough time so you are not rushed. :) Q3: What is the dimension of the dresser? A: The dimensions of the dresser is 15.67\"D x 47.24\"W x 31.38\"H.

                "reviewText": "This dresser gets the A+ rating from me primarily for the ease of use of the directions and for not only using screws, but including the screw driver! Only 1 piece had to be tightened with the dreaded allen wrench. The pictures were very clear and easy to follow despite my preference for written directions, I had no issues following along. I was able to assemble all of it alone, and only required a second set of hands to upright the unit for the finishing steps. The quality of the predrilled holes is a key part to aligning pieces and being able to keep an item square, and they were spot on. The drawer slides are nice feature for the price point. The finish and even the hardware are sleek and perfect for a teenager's room. I did take my time and spent several hours assembling the unit over 2 days, but I binged a few shows and there was not one bad word uttered- the first time ever assembling anything!",

It looks nice and pretty true to the online pictures. It's smaller than what it might seem from the pictures, but true to the listed measurements. The hardware used to put it together is very low quality and you have to be careful to not bend or break something. One nice touch is that they send a package of extra pieces.It's built, it looks decent. We'll see if it holds up to regular usage by a child. Overall, seems decent for the price so far.",

Trust me I did the research. The quality is very good.NOW as far as putting it together\u2026Not gonna lie. It took a while. Like 4 hours.Keep in mind that this is not wood. It looks like wood but for the price you can\u2019t expect it to be.You get directions and all the pieces you need to assemble but if you don\u2019t have patience, have a friend do it for you!We also purchased the matching 8 drawer dresser. I don\u2019t know why this is advertised as baby furniture because it works for adults too!!Just a little side note\u2026. I ordered 2 dressers together. I got 1 shipping notification for both. On delivery day i only received 1. I immediately contacted seller and they got back to me right away!! They said they did ship together but FedEx for some reason decided to deliver on 2 different days. Seller provided the other tracking and I received it next day.Overall i am extremely happy with my order. The customer service is excellent and i will definitely purchase from here again and yes i would highly recommend \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

I am assuming because I stay upstairs they did not want to deliver it to the correct address. However, the dresser is very sturdy and easy to put together. The screws does not go all the way in for the handles, so the handles moves a lot. I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend this purchase.",
