                "reviewText": "This unit is pretty and better quality than I thought it might be, especially the flower fabric. This shelving unit was easy to build; it took me a little over an hour mostly by myself with a couple of stops in between. I needed some help holding up one of the sides while I screwed the other side in and got one of the back braces on. I read reviews prior that someone didn\u2019t do that and it caused damage. One of the bases to one of the drawers was slightly damaged, but it was facing the bottom of the drawer and didn\u2019t show, so no big deal. It did not affect the unit at all. Note that the unit is not sturdy until you fill the drawers. It comes with hardware to attach to the wall or even another piece of furniture to keep it from tipping over. I do not use it and have no tipping issues.",

This is a perfect piece that will match almost any decor. The drawers have quite a bit of room and hold plenty. Assembly took about 20 minutes for each and is very simple to follow.",

                "reviewText": "This piece looks like the photo. It\u2019s just a metal frame with a wooden top and fabric drawers. The drawers are super easy to put together and the handles for them as well, but the directions are absolutely awful!! It\u2019s basically a diagram with letters. For some reason, there is no instruction video for this particular piece, even though there are videos for almost every other piece in this line.It was a lot of trial and error. The pieces they provided to stick it to the wall are also pretty useless, but it\u2019s a very small dresser-and not heavy-so I wouldn\u2019t even use them.The stars are for the beauty of the drawers, the amount of space (in a small piece of furniture),and it appears pretty sturdy. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily use this as a dresser if you have a lot of large clothing to put in it-for example, if you live in a cold climate and need sweaters. If you live in a warm climate, this probably has enough space.I think it\u2019s about $10 overpriced but I think it\u2019s a clever design",
