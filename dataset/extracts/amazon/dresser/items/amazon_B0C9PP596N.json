            "\u3010Pay attention to the FULL-size\u3011This dresser for the bedroom with fabric bins will save your space and is a great furniture to store magazines, clothes for adult or boys and girls, kid's toys, etc. The wooden top board has a load-bearing capacity of up to 66 pounds and can be used instead of a TV stand. Kindly confirm that the full size of this 5-drawer dresser is: 38\"L x 11.81\" W x 20.87\" H",
            "\u3010Ample Storage Space\u30112 large drawers and 3 small drawers offer large storage space, you can divide the area and make storage more neat. The large drawer at the bottom can store at least 12 ordinary adult T-shirts or 7 pairs of jeans. And the 3 small drawers can store socks, underwear, toddler toys etc. If you own multiple pieces of this dresser, they're also stackable to save space.",
            "\u3010Sturdy and Stable\u3011This chest of drawers uses a thickened metal frame to keep it stable, with 4 adjustable feets to protect your floor from scratches, and you can adjust the balance of the dresser in small areas. Using the anti-tilt device, an auxiliary feature can be added if the dresser is attached to the wall, as it prevents falling caused by uneven floors or children climbing.",
            "\u3010Multifunctional Use\u3011The dresser reduces the restrictions of use. You can use it freely with your existing furniture, such as replacing the TV stand in the living room, or as a nightstand, bedside table, wardrobe, closet in the bedroom, or as a shoe cabinet in the porch, entryway, hallway, etc. This fabric organizer is lightweight, only about 21 lb, and it can be moved anywhere without much effort.",
            "\u3010Quick Assemble\u3011All the necessary installation tools are included in the package and you can find the guide video on this page. According to the instructions, you can complete the installation in about 30 minutes. Of course, the time will be shortened if you use your own power tools. If you have any questions about the installation process or product, we are ready to help you efficiently and at any time."

I ordered this one based off of price and size, risking quality. The quality did not disappoint! Very nice and sturdy. I did not anchor mine to the wall, but it does come with the screws and anchors to do so, and even has holes in the frame to put the screws threw. Easy assembly.",
