I was able to fit most of what was in the totes plus some of stuff that was on the shelves above, in boxes, in these drawer units. Now everything is more easily accessible. I was very diligent about finding units that were just below the height of my shelf and wide enough to put two. I wasn\u2019t expecting much from these but I will say, they seem very sturdy, solid, and they\u2019re aesthetically appealing. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use these in a bedroom especially if you\u2019re needing something not as deep as traditional furniture and/or needing something budget friendly. These would also be great for extra organization in closets. The handles do seem really cheap but once assembled, you don\u2019t even notice. Also very easy to put together. Putting the handles on was the most time consuming, but absolutely worth it.",

NO issues and the containers are still holding up after all the use and moving we have made with them.Keep in mind I am a minimalist when it comes to furniture so my thoughts on getting drawers is always to maximize storage and minimizing bulk space in my home. These do it fantastic and they are super easy to take apart and move with.They were aproximately 100 dollars before tax. If you need something in a pinch that you won't have to worry about giving away or needing for long use consider this one of your better options.",

                "reviewText": "You might need two people to built it,To help with the pieces specifically for the drawer handles you're going to need a power drill if you're not strong it helps a lotIt's nice and light weight to move around.Very stable and sturdy. I have a 32in roku t.v. on itDon't force to screw it in, make sure it's tight but don't over do it you'll strip the screws and mess it up.No damage was found or doneIt looks very nice so nice I bought two",

I had to return 2 ( no rails) it\u2019s a great product to buy very spacious very open but they are missing the parts to put it together to make it what it needs to be. Also the black boxes that you see on the bottom of the dresser is the boxes they came, and I also ordered some black wrapping paper because these organize dressers are so low and I wanted a little height.",
