This piece looks amazing and I\u2019m just waiting for it to be available in another color to but more for my husband\u2019s office.It was petty simple to set up, but one support piece wasn\u2019t sized correctly and took quite a bit of effort and a mallet to get it together. I doubt I\u2019ll ever be able to get it apart, but it\u2019s light and easy to move, so I am not concerned about that.Because of the open sides, I had to get bookends to hold books in place, but it\u2019s a nice compliment to the decor and not overpowering.",

It\u2019s sturdy but the metal pieces are hard to connect, while it should be a quick put together, one of the kegs wouldn\u2019t go in no matter how much I tried until I put it together backwards. Instructions say make sure all hole parts on all 3 legs are the same but it just wouldn\u2019t go in, wouldn\u2019t connect. I tried it backwards and it went in just fine, but now one the little backs is in the front. While it comes with the tool you need to put it together, it\u2019s very small & painful, had I not lost our entire home to a fire, I would of used my own tool, so save yourself the stress & pain & be sure to use your own.I would actually purchase it again, my daughter loves it, it looks nice. Just be sure to have the right screw drivers & I\u2019ll try again tomorrow to take it apart & retry the correct way",

The small screws were annoying because there was no thread for the screw to go into. I\u2019d recommend drilling them in if you have one handy. The pieces don\u2019t go perfectly together so you have to do a bit of wiggling. I love the finished product and it feels sturdy!",

Recommend using your own if you have them. The size is smaller than what I was anticipating but it still works for the intended purpose. I love the shelves and drawer combo. I don't like that the top drawers have gaps (seen in pic). But it's out holding socks and undies in my closet really so not a huge deal. If it was a main part of my furniture I would be more upset by it. Overall happy with my purchase.",
