Has a new smell to it that went away after a couple days but to be aspected and didn't bother me a bit. The height and length of this dresser is nice but why do they all and I mean the material made dressers only go 12 inches deep at most. I knew when I was buying this dresser it was gonna hold my winter cloths threw the florida spring summer and fall so they will be in these drawers for 9 months outta the year so I cut seder wood bottoms to keep the moths away. Overall this is a nice dresser. It's very sturdy with the back bracing. I have my 55 inch TV on it and I'm not worried about bendage. People please don't over tighten the screws, snug is perfect and two middle screws are counter sunk so the drawer doesn't rub a hole in it. I got all my winter gear in there with a top drawer still empty for more stuff. I like it so much I bought two file cabinet size dressers to go along with it. It was a good buy, get this if your looking.",

                "reviewText": "This is exactly what I thought it would be. It's light, easy to put together, attractive to look at and came as advertised and in good condition. The fit and finish is good; I found no snags or sharp edges. It won't last a long time the way we use things but that was kind of the point of getting it as a temporary piece given that we're not shopping for furniture at the moment; it's a nice piece that is affordable, attractive, and easy to get and use in a pandemic. The box it comes in is not very large, which is also a delivery plus.A couple of things to consider: it isn't particularly stable and probably can't be loaded up with heavy stuff. It comes with screws you can use to attach it to a wall so it doesn't fall on curious children or pets. Also, the drawers have no stops on them so you have to pull them most but not all of the way out or they come out in your hand. In my case this will be no problem as it will hold stuff like the bandaid supply and knitting and so on. It's nice and clean and neatly finished so it would be fine for clothing but I wouldn't use it for anything heavy, liquid, or breakable.",

The dresser is sturdy and if you follow instructions its easy to put up however the drawers are the size of a shoe, i was expecting bigger drawers which is my dissapointment but apart from that it does its job, it could be useful for kids clothes since its small and it can fit more of that and for under wear and socks. Apart from all of this the color gray is pretty and it looks classy, the drawers feel like theyre cardboard covered with what looks like jeans \ud83d\udc56 cloth but the black build surrounding the drawers is made out of sturdy wood. Personally, I like this dresser, only give 4 stars because in the pictures it looks big and the dresser itself is but the drawers are not as wide and lengthy as I expected.",
