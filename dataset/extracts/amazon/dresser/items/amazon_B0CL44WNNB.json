                "reviewText": "I am so incredibly happy with my new dresser! Previously, I was struggling to find enough storage space for my clothing collection, so this dresser has been a lifesaver. While it may not be large enough to be my main dresser, it is perfect for providing that extra storage space that I require.The assembly process was not too difficult, although it did take a bit of time. I wanted to make sure that everything was done just right, so I read through the instruction guide carefully before starting. This helped me to anticipate any potential issues and avoid any mistakes. While the guide may seem daunting at first, it is definitely worthwhile to take the time to read through it thoroughly.One of my favorite things about this dresser is the spacious drawers. They are much roomier than I expected, which is fantastic for storing all of my clothes. Additionally, they slide in and out with ease, which makes it very convenient for me to access my clothing quickly and efficiently. The dresser also feels very sturdy and high-quality, which is surprising given its affordable price point.While I personally wouldn't use this dresser as my main dresser, it would be perfect for a child's room or as extra storage space in any bedroom. The simplistic design is also a major plus, as it allows the dresser to blend in seamlessly with any decor. I plan on adding a unique touch to the front drawer panels with a really cool peel-and-stick wallpaper that I also purchased from Amazon. I think this should give the dresser a more personalized feel and hopefully make it stand out even more.Overall, I am beyond thrilled with this dresser and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for extra storage space. It is definitely a worthwhile investment that has made my life so much easier.",

                "reviewText": "Once assembled, the outcome is a beauty!This has lots of pieces, but assembly went very smoothly. I was finished in about 30 minutes.The parts came well packed and well labeled. The instructions were clear and straightforward.I am using this as a night table in my guest bedroom, and the size is perfect! This is in no way a small night stand. Guests will heave lots of space to store their things.The finished product is a heavy weight piece of furniture. The box weighed a ton, so I had to remove the pieces from the box to get it into the bedroom for assembly.The main parts of this night stand are made of wood. The drawer hardware is made of white coated metal. I was happy that each piece of drawer hardware had an identifying label impressed right into the metal. This made it easy to identify what\u2019s what when installing. (DR, DL etc.)The drawers are so roomy and they slide very smoothly. When inserting the drawers, make sure the drawer rollers are placed properly when you slide them in. The hand grips to open and close the drawers are well done and the opening is the perfect size.The finish on this piece is flawless. It\u2019s a white matte finish which I love. I have cleaned it and all went well. The finish seems very durable.When this was delivered, the proof of delivery photo showed someone else\u2019s door. My heart sank because I really wanted this, but I was determined to find out where it ended up. I\u2019m so happy that I tracked down the mis-delivered package. I\u2019m over the moon happy with this quality piece and I\u2019m happy to have it!I highly recommend this! A quality piece at a fair price!",

                "reviewText": "This small dresser was ordered to be a nightstand for my daughter, and she is the one who unpacked and assembled it. The dresser parts arrived well packaged in foam and each piece was labeled with a number or letter, making assembly convenient and easy. My daughter does not have a lot of experience assembling furniture or using power tools, but found it to be intuitive to put together. The directions were easy to follow and only required use of a hand drill and screwdriver for assembly. My daughter had it all put together in an hour, and was pleased with her solid piece of bedroom furniture for her apartment. This dresser is the perfect size for a nightstand. Would recommend this especially for use in a dorm or apartment.",

                "reviewText": "The assembly was timely and somewhat complicated with soooooo many screws (at least 150) and you can\u2019t even use an electric screwdriver. The directions were fairly confusing at times and unless you have 2-3 hours to devote to assembly then don't bother. The end product is attractive and sturdy (use mine as a larger than usual nightstand) and is most definitely a great storage option.",

                "reviewText": "Sometimes I think to myself, \"I'm a an alpha male I can assemble \"Blank\" without reading the instructions\". This was not one of those instances, as I read the instructions from the beginning and it was still painful. First the good...Good: Attractive design. Very stable, solid wood construction (metal gliders and decent wood, not glorified balsa wood like some Ikea furniture). Nice size, with a fair amount of room in each drawer. Only a screwdriver needed for assembly and it comes with extra screws, just in case.Bad: To get from the before to the after picture took me almost 2 hours. The instruction packet recommends 2 people, but I didn't feel like pestering a friend. The instructions are easy enough to understand but assembling everything without a power drill (as it recommends) is very time consuming. If I have to assemble furniture, I prefer for it to be in the \"30 minutes or less\" category.It's a very nice dresser and I recommend it, but would give it 4.5 stars due to the time factor. Just remember it will go quicker if you have a friend.",
