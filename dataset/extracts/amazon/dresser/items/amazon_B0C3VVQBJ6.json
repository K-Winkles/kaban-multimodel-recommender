I am impressed. The drawers are a perfect size. If I ever needed a dresser again, I would definitely consider this one or something else from this supplier.",

I put some flowers on the top to dress it up and use it to my all my misc. things. Can take a good amount of stuff. It works perfectly for that. I would but again for maybe a den or office. The color is very nice. Easy to put together once you understand the fit of the pieces. Took me about 30 mins.",

                "reviewText": "This unit is great! It took me a little longer to assemble because I didn't read the directions as closely as I should have (put one part in the wrong place and then had to move it, and did it again in another spot.) The dimensions on mine were slightly off for the bottom drawers so I had to shave off about 1/4 inch from the inner cardboard lining to make them fit, but other than than it's way sturdier than I expected and perfect for holding random papers and lose items in my office under my desk. I have a U-shaped office desk and this fits perfectly underneath one section of it without interfering with my legroom.",

It is still hard for older/disabled/weaker people to bend down that far. if you guys ever offer a leg extender kit you can take more of my money!Update: I downgraded to 3 stars. I really needed it taller so I purchased the one with 2 shelves. Was sent the wrong color. It's the wood tone but I ordered Gray. Doesn't match. The height is perfect and the product is great.",
