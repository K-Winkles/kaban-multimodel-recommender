                "reviewText": "I really like Lutron's Caseta system. Most of my gear are the in-wall dimmers, but I do have a few plug in dimmers as well. The Pico system is great because it can be mounted on a wall like a switch or you can also just leave it loose and use it as a remote. My living room has a plug in dimmer and a Sonos speaker, so I have a Pico Music remote and a regular dimmer controller. I have them both on the two Pico stand and it really looks nice, and I'm not constantly hunting down remotes.The Pico stands have a surprising amount of heft to them and they have a non-skid non-marring surface on the bottom so it's safe to keep on furniture or glass. My only complaint is that the multiple Pico stands are pretty expensive for what they are. But once you get over that it adds a lot of class to a room.",

                "reviewText": "If you use Lutron Caseta products, you know the Pico remotes. This holds three of them in a little row, which is great for putting somewhere that has several lights in the vicinity. (Honestly, I like pedestals better than wall switches.) Like the other Pico pedestals (the 1-mount and 2-mount) it is firmly weighted with a nice premium no-slip bottom and metal construction so everything stays in place and it's not just another remote to slide around and get lost. And the angle makes it easy to use them in place without picking them up, which is great usability and further avoids the \"remote getting lost\" issues.",
