                "reviewText": "I was needing a little dresser to hold clothes that I normally fold. I was using the plastic tubs style drawers, but wanted something a little nicer to place in the bedroom, but something cheap. This is when I found this. It was cheap and appeared to be nice looking, at least nice for the money. This is what I think of it:Pros:- Ease of assembly: This was very easy to assemble. There were a couple issues, but I'll address those in the cons. But as far as difficulty, this was one of the easier things I've assembled.- Looks: This little dresser looks pretty good when you think about paying under $90 for it. You can tell it is not expensive, but it still looks nice.- Packaging: It was packaged well, but what impressed me the most was the individually packaged hardware and parts being labeled. Usually with cheaper things like this, you get hardware not labeled and have to guess what is what. These all were labeled clearly.- Size: This is perfect for smaller areas like dorms or small apartments. It is not very deep, but I was able to fit more than I expected, especially in the larger drawers.- Weight: This is very light. When it was fully assembled, I was able to easily pick it up and put it in place. This also means that it can also move easily when you don't want it to, but this can be fixed by placing a little rug tape under the feet if this is one a hard surface.Cons:- Included tool: The included tool is a 90 degree allen wrench with a phillips screwdriver on the long side. The allen wrench worked alright, but the phillips screw driver was terrible. I ended up using one of my own. This was one of the things that made the assembly less than perfect.- Fitment: The middle supports on mine were a bit difficult to install. I had to use a little force to bend the long supports outward to get the screws to start. This was the case with all 3 of them. Once I got the screws started, I was able to tighten them down easily, but getting them started was a bit of a chore.- Alignment: I had one drawer support that was welded a little higher than the other. This cased the drawer to sit a little higher on one side. This is pretty noticable, but not a deal breaker for me.Overall, I'm happy with this purchase. It is small enough to fit in a limited space, cost was just about right, and it was easy to assemble. If you are looking for something cheap and easy to put together, and you do not have a lot of clothes you're looking to put in it, this is definitely something to consider. Just don't expect perfection or compare it to higher priced furniture or you will be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "It seems pretty sturdy for what it is. The drawers are that flimsy non woven fabric stuff, but they include little thin Masonite panels to put in the bottoms. It was easy enough for me to assemble by myself, just a bit awkward at times, but no missing pieces or misaligned holes, no chips or dings. They only had dark gray, and since it\u2019s going into the black hole under a craft table, I spray painted the drawer fronts with a light colored spray paint I had lying around, and it actually looks pretty good. I feel like it will hold a lot of stuff, and I like the higher ground clearance.",

This is a cheap thing so don\u2019t expect much, the \u201cwood\u201d parts are obviously really cheap that will be ruined if they get damp and the metal parts are very thin but all of that is to be expected in this day and age but because of missing pieces I\u2019d give this product zero stars because it\u2019s not even missing screws or something that you can easily go to the store and buy more for pennies nope I\u2019m missing a few different metal pieces that prevent you from actually building this. I went to their website that it directs you to for support and their chat option just says they\u2019re offline and to message them your phone number so that they can contact you, how about no? Why would I give you my personal information because you don\u2019t want to provide proper support. I\u2019ve emailed them and I will update this review if they ever respond to me and if they even send me the missing pieces but that could take months seeing as it will take a few weeks if I\u2019m lucky for them to respond to my email and then another month or so for them to ship the item to me since you know they will ship it as cheaply as possible so it\u2019s going to take a long time and probably won\u2019t even arrive.And yes I did look all throughout the box and under everything so no the parts aren\u2019t just hidden.",
