                "reviewText": "I needed a small dresser to fit under a shelf in a closet without having to modify the shelf. This dresser fit the bill, and it was fairly easy to assemble. The instructions say not to use a power drill, but I did--carefully--otherwise, you'd be manually screwing in tiny screws forever. The key is going slowly and not overpowering the clutch.Anyway, it took about 2 hours to put together, including fixing one instance of putting the rollers on incorrectly due to a misleading drawing. Though the instructions look like you should put the right side rollers on to protrude past the frame--don't do it! Also, they drawings show which screw holes to use for the rollers and this is very important.Overall, very happy with it for the looks and value.",

The instructions say not to use a drill and I did try anyway, but the screws will ream easily with a drill, so trust the instructions and all should go well. The drawers in particular are sturdy and the finish on the whole pice is very good. I have white kitchen cabinets with black hardware and I bought this to use for extra storage.

                "reviewText": "The picture is pretty and I hoped it would be just what I needed so I ordered two for both bedrooms.Pictures are deceiving. These dressers are extremely cheap, very difficult to put together and we were never able to get the drawers to align. Some of the drawers won\u2019t even shut no matter what we tried.It is very unbalanced and tips forward slightly. Completely unsafe. I only put one together and am sending the other back without even opening it.I wish I could return the one I put together but can\u2019t. It is horrible and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with it - it\u2019s sitting in my garage with the rest of the trash.",

                "reviewText": "This dresser is tiny but it does work for small spaces. I wish it was a tad taller with one more set of drawers because you can\u2019t fit a lot of adult clothes in it. It is perfect for a little kid room. The smell is strong but goes away eventually. It took a couple hours to assemble. It is sturdy enough! It comes with the wall safety straps. I think it\u2019s a bit pricey for what it is, but I would still recommend esp if you have a small space.",

                "reviewText": "Update- Seller contacted us to find a resolution for the issues. Great customer service, very much appreciated.Similar experience as other reviews. The dresser from a distance looks just as pictured, but up close its a mess. The paint is rough, the drawer faces have white lines at the top left corner where they were glued together on all 6 drawers. Its pretty cheaply made, not worth its hefty price tag.Arrived in a thin box with no protective material so it was damaged. Our damaged parts ended up being on the bottom or in the back so we went with assembling it, wish we would have returned it.Super difficult to put together, took us 4 hours. Some of the pre-drilled holes did not align correctly, some of them were clearly incorrectly drilled. We matched up all the drawer pieces together and 4 of them had holes that were much larger then the rest. All the screws for these pieces are the same size so its clearly a mistake.The drawers are WAY smaller then expected. The dimensions for this dresser are bigger then the dresser we replaced, but the drawers for some reason are much smaller.I can say from a distance it still looks nice, the finish on the top piece is nice, and the drawers pull out nicely, but the cons out weight the pros, it is not at all worth the price.",
