In addition, it is very easy to move around. As someone who moves a lot, I really like the design of this furniture set. I even bought other furniture from the same collection to match. Best of all, the price of this furniture set is really surprising in its category. A satisfying purchase",

Pay attention to how you put the outside pieces because if you do like me and put in on backwards the drawers will fall out the back. Make sure that the part that stops the drawers is on the back. It's a good descent set.",
