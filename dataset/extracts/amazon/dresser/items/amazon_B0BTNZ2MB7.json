It was old, big and heavy so I figured it was time for something a little less bulky.Saw this item and seemed like it would be a nice replacement. I normally don't like these fabric bins/drawers but since I'm only putting small clothing in this, it should be fine. Assembly is pretty straight forward and it's pretty light once assembled. Assembling the bins actually took the longest time.Since this is a small clothing dresser, I only put things like underwear, socks and t-shirts in here. Even fully loaded, it's still light enough to carry around. Plus, with these bins being removable, whenever seasons change, I can swap the out with other bins in lieu of having to store them in a suitcase or something.While not \"fancy\" looking furniture, it works just fine and is inexpensive so that's what matters to me.",
