                "reviewText": "This is the third piece of furniture i bout from WLive after i discovered another dresser of theirs on tik tok that i bought for my teen daughter. I also have a small 2 drawer nightstand from this company. Everything is holding up great so far!Pros: Very very easy Easy to assemble and all parts are labeled well. It took me maybe 45 mins at most to do. Nice design, drawers are deeper and hold more than i thought. The heaviest items i put in the bottom drawers and its mostly pajama pants and joggers, i don't have any jackets or anything like that in there but it probably could take a few moderately big items just fine. Looks great and has a modern look in my room.Cons: right out of the package it does have a little awkward smell to it. As i assembled each fabric drawer i simple put a dash of body spray in and opened a window to air it out. Not a huge deal but someone sensitive to smells might not want to be bothered with it. Once it aired out in about in hour it was fine.As i was about halfway through inserting the drawer brackets i noticed that one of the wholes in the leg frame hadn't been punched/drilled properly so i had to do it myself. Was a little nervous to do so because i didn't want to mess up the frame but i ended up using a drill on the lowest setting to go over the current trace lines and it was fine. Not worth returning since i was almost done at that point. Make sure you inspect all the holes in the frame ahead of time!!For reference points on size, there's exactly 38 inches between the window ledge on the left and the entry door on right so i needed something tall and slim. I have about 4-5 inches of space on the right side of the dresser so it worked out. The tv sitting on top is a lightweight 24inch Insignia. I also have a flat panel surge protector and antenna sitting on top with the tv.Overall would recommend furniture from this company.",

                "reviewText": "Did I enjoy putting this together? I'm going to say no, I didn't, but, it was so easy to put together that my 9-year-old helped. I have this my bedroom and purchased it with the intention of keeping night clothes and undergarments in here and I've got more than enough space to do that. I also keep our swimsuits in here and it's perfect for just about anything. I would not put super heavy things in the drawers even though they are fairly stiff. They still can bend if you ever stuff them. It is a good looking and pretty sturdy little unit. I like the fact that it's got a nice hard top to it so you can use it decoratively or for more storage if you like. My goal is to eventually move this into my closet, but I still have some weeding through and giving away to do before that happens. It definitely does the job and I would order this again.",

I put my unmentionables, shirts, pants and sweatpants in the dresser and it holds a decent amount of stuff. I plan on ordering another the 9 dresser one too. If you're looking for something to hold you over for a while WHILST being on a budget, id definitely say go for it !",

                "reviewText": "I bought this dresser to clean up the look of my closet. At 11.8\" deep it fits nicely in a standard size bedroom closet. There is room to spare in front so it doesn't look crowded. The wood finish version could be mistaken for actual wood at a distance. I was worried that the drawers would fall out if you didn't use two hands because they're not on tracks. Turns out the weight of the objects within (even if it's only T-shirts) is sufficient to hold the drawer in place. The drawers are made of cloth and cardboard but again, from a distance, you can't tell. The drawers are very roomy. I was able to fit in all my shirts, sweaters, slacks and shorts and still had enough drawers left for 3 sheet sets, my purses and a stack of random items.I do have to quibble about the assembly. I absolutely hate to put together furniture! This one was easier than some but it still took me 3 hours. They need a better quality control engineer, since the screws and screw holes weren't perfectly calibrated, making the job more difficult. Also, I really dislike Allan Wrenches, and this dresser relies on it exclusively (it's included, so no other tools are necessary). They're hard to fit into the tiny opening. You have to fit it back in over and over again because you can only manage about a 3/4 turn each time. The little screwdriver tip for putting the handles on is ridiculous. Again, you can only go about 3/4 turn before having to re-adjust your grip. I used my own short-stem screwdriver for that part. The instructions were clear and the drawings comprehensible, so that's a plus.Now that the thing is put together, despite some mumbling and grumbling on my part, I'm very pleased with the way it's transformed my closet.",
