However, it's the same fabric as the drawers, with a wood grain printed on it. I didn't have high expectations at this price point, but... I think it would bother me if it wasn't faux wood, if it was just a solid color like the drawers.Other than that, assembly took about 15 minutes, which was good. It seems pretty sturdy, as long as it isn't weighted down too much, and it isn't wobbly at all.So not in love with the look of it at all, but I don't want to go through the returns process and will replace it with something nicer when I can afford to do so. But it's functional and easy. And fast delivery!",
