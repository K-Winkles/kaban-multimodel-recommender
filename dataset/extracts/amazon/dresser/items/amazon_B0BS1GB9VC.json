Its for sure cheap quality....instead of using it in our bedroom like I planned, we are going to shove it in my son's closet so we can at least get some use out of it.",

It was close, so that worked and the dresser was a good size for my needs.The bad part?Screws and bolts were missing, draw pulls were cheap plastic knobs, the piece for the back of the dresser was flimsy cardboard, the holes for the screws were not drilled correctly and it took 3 hours to build and was flimsy when I stood it up. Not sure what I can put on top but don't know that it can hold the weight of my television. The drawers were also very difficult to get on the track and align to fit into the dresser.I am using it for now but if I had to do it over again, I would look for something else.",

Its not made from any good materials so its expected. Ill give it maybe one to one and a half years before it makes its way to keep us warm in the fire pit!",
