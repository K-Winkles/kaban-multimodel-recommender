I was able to get it together in 30 minutes but did have three issues.First, one of the drawer supports was bent and I had to bend it back to get the middle section connected.Second, one of the drawers has extremely crooked holes for the handles and looks pretty not great.Third, the two drawers in the center are wedged in so tight that you can't pull them out. I'm hoping if I loosen the sides a little bit it'll give it enough space to slide out, but I'm concerned it's going to compromise stability.They did include a card if you have issues so I will be contacting them, but overall mediocre product. If it wasn't such a pain to send back I probably would but it's going in a closet anyway where no one will see it.",
