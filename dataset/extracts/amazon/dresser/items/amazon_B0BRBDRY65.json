I\u2019m a carpenter by trade and very handy but that doesn\u2019t matter it takes one person at least 2.5hrs to assemble. On a positive note, the piece is very sturdy, very sleek design nice curvature and crisp edges and seems like it\u2019s built to last a while and for the price I give it b 4.5/5. Started project at 15:40 finished 18:49.",

As it does take about a hour to put together, it is durable, sturdy, and a good material overall. It arrived way earlier than It said on the app depending on where you live. I\u2019m just confused on some of these bad reviews. Make sure you're reading the instructions 100%. As I have no idea how some are saying it\u2019s coming apart when there done.",

It took me about four hours to complete on my own with a tv going. If you go slow and lay out all the pieces it will help, IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO GET THE SCREWS flushed with the drawer railing/sliders then keep trying or remove the screw. On a few of my rails, they only have two screws instead of three because I could not get it flushed and that teeny tiny issue would keep the wheels from rolling and the drawers not being able to open so you have to very forcibly remove the drawers and keep trying. Once I figured it out and removed the screw(s) the drawers glide effortlessly. Very solid piece and looks pricey but it was some work.",
