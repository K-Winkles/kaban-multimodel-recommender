The manufacturers of \u201cbaby furniture\u201d seem to offer a better product than others within the price category. I also liked the size. Some of the dressers were very short.The dresser came well packaged. All the pieces were pristine and all hardware was provided. Other than a mislabeling of a few parts in the pictured directions (follow the text which is accurate) assembly was straight forward. We buy a lot of box furniture and my husband says this was a breeze to put together. It took him several hours using a drill for all the screws.It is solid and heavy. I will change out the knobs when I find some I like since this is going in a guest room rather than a nursery. But for now I do like the chunky size of the ones it came with. The color is lovely\u2014soft white with a soft sheen.The only negative for me is how thin the legs are. Be careful moving this dresser.",
