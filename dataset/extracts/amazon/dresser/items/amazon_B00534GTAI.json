The dresser did not hold very good structure during the move do to it only having wood pegs and wood glue to hold the general construction of it together. I feel as if there was an extra packet of the wood glue it may have survived the move better. (Side note, while moving this dresser it was me and 2 other people. One held onto the center and two at the side. Sadly the structure was just not strong enough. The drawers were all removed for the move as well. Other than this instance though I absolutely loved this dresser. Personally would buy again and would just add my own structural support.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, it's a great dresser. It's smaller than I thought it'd be. It looks very minimalistic. I love the color and the sleekness, but the drawers are very small. It also took over 2 hours to put together. The instructions were easy to follow, especially if you watch the video instructions (have to scan to pull it up on your phone -or maybe it's an app download, don't remember). If you want a nice black dresser on a budget this might be the best option. But if you don't care too much about the color, I think the Ikea Malm dresser might be better because the drawers are bigger. The Ikea Malm dresser just doesn't come in true black. But it's cheaper and takes just as long to put together.",

                "reviewText": "The dresser came in two boxes. The directions weren't really easy to read. There were a few times in the process where I had to take it apart and move things around because I had put something in the wrong hole or wood turned the wrong way. The instructions tell you to use wood glue (included) when adding two pieces of wood onto the bottom part of the top long piece of the dresser. I put the glue on, as directed, and pushed the pieces into the predrilled holes. When it came time to put the top onto the dresser I could not get it to go down! After looking I realized the two pieces of wood I glued on were too long. There was a piece of wood in the middle of the dresser that was meant to fit perfectly between them. Because they were glued, I had no option to remove them and drill more holes. I literally had to shave the edges of each piece off so they would fit and the top of the dresser would go on. Doing so chipped the black coating and it looks horrible! The dresser overall really wouldn't have been bad for the price if I didn't have to tear it up to put it together. If you're unsatisfied you can either return the dresser (how am I going to return a dresser assembled and glued together?), get a replacement piece (I can't remove the defect pieces to put on the replacement because they are glued on) or accept a 10% refund to keep as it is. Customer service stinks. I will not purchase from buyer again. Save your money and go buy a cheaper dresser from Walmart that can actually be assembled properly.UPDATE: Two months later it's falling apart. The drawers won't even close properly. The seller did send me a replacement front to one of the drawers because a corner snapped off when I was trying to open it (it was stuck). I have 2 pairs of jeggings, 5 cotton shorts and 5 leggings (not heavy at all) and the bottom of the drawer is falling through and it won't close.",

It's a good thing I've assembled a lot of furniture in the past. The components are also poorly labeled.Mine also arrived slightly damaged in two spots. I don't know if that happened during shipping or before, so I won't blame them for that.Overall it goes well in my girls' room, and I'm thinking it'll last longer than their previous dressers.",

I\u2019m getting glass cut to fit the top of this drawer so drinks or anything don\u2019t leave a stain ... not that the material is cheap... I REALLY RECOMMEND if you plan on buying this drawer you get it with assembly because it\u2019s a pain in the ass to assemble .. i paid for assembly but me and the assembler both looked at the instructions and it\u2019s really hard if your trying yourself because the screws all come in ONE bag mixed up .. u have to basically guess which ones go where and the instructions would be the same if it was a blank sheet of paper luckily he took 5 hours not the whole day to assemble so just looking out.!",

                "reviewText": "Just pay attention. I love putting furniture together, but this came with some challenges. You can't absent-mindedly do this or you're going to mess something up. Apparently words are too much to ask for and instructions are all in pictures. So just pay attention when you hammer in those wood screws. You do not want to have to try to get that back out. The board will shatter. Just pay attention to what you're doing, and this is an easy fun dresser to put together. It's also huge and pretty. I will take pics later. Sturdy too. Could be used as a TV Stand as well or add a nice mirror to it. Lots of space for accent decor.",
