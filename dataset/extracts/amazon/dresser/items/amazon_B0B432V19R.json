We bought two, the 1st one took 45 mins to assemble, the second 35mins. So it is fairly simple to put back together. We just ordered 3 more!",

                "reviewText": "I simply can not say enough good things about this purchase. I was looking for something to go in my daughter's room in our camper at the lake. Her room only being 8 ft wide, I needed something that would fit, but also give me ample storage. I looked at other options made of wood that were so much more expensive. My fear is the cloth-like drawers would be flimsy and not hold up and also feared the entire chest wouldn't be sturdy. With the camper being our home away from home we decided to go with this one over a wood chest due to the drastic difference in cost. I'm so glad we did!!! I'm so pleasantly surprised at how sturdy it is. Once put together it does not rock or teater. The drawers are made of a stiffer fabric and not flimsy at all. You have to use a little common sense and not over stuff them as they will bow and bulge, and heavy items placed in them might be a problem. But for my daughters clothes and supplies it works perfect for us. We also love having the shelves to set stuff on. The only negative thing I can say is we did order the gray and as you can see from the photo, it does look more black then gray. That was a little disappointing. However, we love how sturdy this is and how much cheaper than purchasing a real wood chest it is, that it is an issue we can over look. But if the gray color is what you want, just know the advertised photo is lighter than the actualy chest in person.",
