                "reviewText": "The first thing you gave to do is pour yourself a drink (you\u2019re welcome). Pray to your God and ask for patience. Then\u2026Being organized is key. They number Every. Single. Panel. That\u2019s a good thing because there are a lot of panels. Like\u2026 A LOT.So separate them around you. Know where they are. If you can set up a short table where you can work sitting down on a chair that would be great. If not, pray for good circulation and you\u2019re ready to go.This is not difficult at all. But it is time consuming. Highly recommend using a powered drill. You don\u2019t have one? Stop reading this and call or text a friend that can bring it over now. When they drop it off serve them a drink and have them help you! Again\u2026 you\u2019re welcome.After it\u2019s all said and done, you may or may not be intoxicated, but you will definitely have a very beautiful elegant looking dresser.My only con here is this. The drawers are not as deep as I would have liked them to be. I\u2019m using these in my daughter\u2019s room (I bought two\u2026 you all know by now I finished this drunk!)Other than that. Beautiful!",
