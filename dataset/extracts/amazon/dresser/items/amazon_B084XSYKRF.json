                "reviewText": "This product was horrible from the moment I opened the box and found all the screws in unlabelled bags and terribly vague instructions. Ended up taking 6 hours to build even with power tools. You have to drill directly into the wood in spots that don't look like they're supposed to be screwed into. There's no indentation or marking to indicate where to screw so you kind of have to wing it. Then I finally got it together and within 4 months it's completely fallen apart. All the drawer bottoms sag so much that I can't open and close them anymore. Also, the tracks broke on most of the drawers so they can't properly sit in their slots anymore either. And even when the drawers did work, they don't fully extend, they only come out halfway so it was a=so hard to reach the back half of each drawer. The entire thing is a disaster and complete waste of $300. Save your time and money and do not buy this!!",

We used power tools just because it\u2019s faster and we don\u2019t have Superman\u2019s strength. If you are on the fence about this dresser, you can rest assured you are getting a high quality one.

It definitely feels cheap, so keep that in mind, but it does the job and looks beautiful. It\u2019ll go by faster if you have a drill, but it\u2019s not required. All the screws and such all came in one bag, not separated at all. My suggestion would be to separate them all out and make sure the amount you have matches what\u2019s in the instructions. Mine came with A LOT of extra pieces. On that note, the instructions were a bit unclear but if you have any common sense and pay attention to detail, you\u2019ll be fine. This is definitely something you don\u2019t want to rush.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this dresser for our nursery. A few of the pieces got damaged in transit, but nothing serious enough to return it. But once we started putting it together we were short two of the slides for the drawers. Luckily we found some on Amazon that were just about the same slide. Now, trying to attach the drawers, the screws they give you for this don\u2019t work. They are too short and not \u201cwide enough\u201d for the screw hole. I didn\u2019t want to go through the process of contacting the manufacturer because you have to fill out a form and email it back to them, and hope it got back to us in time. I also swapped out the handles for some nice metal ones, the handles it comes with are cheap and plastic. Other than having to find hardware, it looks like it will be an okay dresser..",

My husband was able to get it together in very little time trying to beat the fastest review time only to see how easy it was to assemble. We recommend laying out all the pieces and separating all the screws before starting. This dresser is very well built when put together. We had extra screws and we didn\u2019t need to use the furniture tie downs to secure it to the wall but it\u2019s always a plus to get them. They are furniture zip ties with wall and furniture secure points. It\u2019s nice they can be undone to reuse when moving or changing the room around instead of having to cut them off.",

                "reviewText": "I got a two year warranty on the dresser and there was an issue with them delivering it the first time because the day of the delivery it got broken in the delivery truck. They sent me a new instead because they couldn\u2019t deliver what has already got broken. But as I got my new one and went to put it together not long after that it was still unsteady and chipped very easily and the drawer would sink in at the bottom and would go back in. I contacted them about it with my warranty and got nothing in return. I paid an additional $100 for a 2 year warranty for nothing. And for them to not contact me back. It\u2019s been four months now and still nothing so I gave up and decided to just warn you guys about this.",
