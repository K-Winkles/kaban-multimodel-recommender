                "reviewText": "Was a little skeptical of buying a cloth drawer dresser, but after getting it all set up it seems really well!\u2022 Everything was packaged nicely and all pieces were wrapped in their own protective bags (no scratches, bends, dents, tears, or chips on anything).\u2022 Instructions were relatively clear with no written instructions.\u2022 As someone with neurological issues, using tools is a bit of a challenge and I had to break out my own screwdriver and wrench because the ones they gave weren\u2019t big enough for me to grab (it\u2019s just generic tools that come with any furniture). But for the most part it was pretty easy and not too difficult to assemble. So easy my 4 year old was able to help and we got it done in about an hour!\u2022 Never have I had a furniture kit have every single metal fastener have extra pieces until now! It even came with an extra foot and an extra handle for the drawer. 100% appreciate that.\u2022 I was originally skeptical of the cloth drawers and knowing how flimsy they can be, but these are pretty thick and sturdy. They should hold for a long time as long as my son isn\u2019t punching them or something crazy.This will hopefully last several years before we can upgrade to a wooden dresser, but my son love it, it\u2019s pretty sturdy, and the fact that I can label the drawers is so great!",
