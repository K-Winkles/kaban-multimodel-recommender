                "reviewText": "I really love this dresser/night stand.I had originally gotten it as a nightstand, but I overestimated how much space I had.Luckily, it fit nicely on the corner of my bedroom.The drawers are not wooden, they are soft squares. However, they are very sturdy! and it does have a wood (or maybe faux wood?) panel where the handle is, so it blends in very nicely. You can't tell from looking at it that it's not all wood. It has a very sleek look.The rest of the dresser, including shelves, are made out of wood. It is all very sturdy but lightweight.Instructions were clear with images to make assembly easy. It does require some patience to build, but that's true for most DIY furniture.Overall, I thought it was a great product at a great price!",

Second thing was the number labels on the items were incorrect third thing was where I supposed to put in screws there was no hole that goes all the way through. It was a hole but it couldn\u2019t come out of the other side because they didn\u2019t drill the hole all the way so the top part of the drawer is loose until I put something on top to keep it sturdy very disappointed.",

There wasn\u2019t and it was pretty easy to put together. It\u2019s a little wobbly, I made sure all screws were tight, and it tilts a little. The drawers have some marks on the front and the back loooks like it\u2019s barely holding on. I put this in my closet, not something I would put out for others to see, but I have to say each drawer holds a good amount of cloths and the shelves hold my shoes without a worry of it falling apart. So if anything it\u2019s great storage.",
