                "reviewText": "It came in like 100 pieces with lots of screws and nails. Every single side of it needs to be assembled individually. Very difficult and time consuming to assemble. My husband is a handyman so we had no problem but if it\u2019s difficult for you I don\u2019t suggest it at all or you need to pay someone to do it for you. I they could make some of the parts bigger so it needs less struggle, but anyway after assembling it, I am satisfied with the result. It\u2019s a beautiful and very sturdy dresser, made from good quality wood. suitable for my kid\u2019s room. It\u2019s drawers are big enough too so I have enough space to put my kid cloths in. Overall it worths my money and I\u2019m happy with it",
