                "reviewText": "I like the way the dresser looks. Fabric is taught and when fully put together it is sturdy. Though, what I do want to point out is the spacing. The pictures in the listing show full size pillows being put in the bottom drawers which, as you can see from my picture, won't actually fit. Second, the little gated portion is a nice look but small. As you can see from my iPad Air it takes up almost all the room. My personal gripes, thought I should point them out.All in all, it's a good, small, dresser. Came with all the necessary tools to put it together as well (screw driver, allen wrench, hex wrench, and all the screws came with one extra which I appreciated). Did it all by hand and, if you're curious, I chose to not mount mine to the wall.",
