The problem however, one of the two sockets is obviously defective as it didn\u2019t work. I tried it on both tail lights and nothing. However the second plug worked fine and fortunately I only needed to replace one tail light socket. So overall, cheap (cheaper then what an auto parts store would charge), easy to install, and thankfully there were two of them! I\u2019d give 5 stars if not for one of the two pieces being defective.",
