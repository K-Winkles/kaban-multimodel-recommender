The front filter did not fit properly, it was very loose and the rear fuel filter does not fit properly as the actuator does not make contact with the check valve. I did follow the priming instructions but fuel did not reach the front filter. Purchased fuel filters from Mopar dealer. Installed those filters, performed the priming process and the truck started.",
