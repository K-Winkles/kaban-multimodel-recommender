This is a nice protection for your console cover\u2026especially after putting on bug spray and or sunblock since we tend to use it as an arm rest. It was super easy to put on. I didn\u2019t even need to review the instructions it was that simple. I opened my console to put it on, was less than 10 seconds. The fit to my 2022 Ram Badlander was perfect. The fabric is soft and quality appears to be good. I like that it\u2019s also washable so when I muck it up I can just toss it in the machine and put back on.",
