No more topping out my RAM usage! I probably could have gotten away with 2X16GB, but for the price, it just made sense to go overkill (as I do a lot of editing and don't want to worry about even coming close to the limit). Anyway, so far, so good! They were easy to install, PC recognizes full 64GB, 30+ Chrome tabs + Photoshop + tracking in Davinci Resolve and my RAM is like, psh, I thought you'd bring me a challenge.",
