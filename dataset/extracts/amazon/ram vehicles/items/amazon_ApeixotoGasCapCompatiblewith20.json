                "reviewText": "Reviewing Apeixoto Gas Cap C, I had an emissions test not too long ago, and they stated I needed a new gas cap even though my car isn\u2019t that old. I went to the auto parts store not far from the emissions station and all they had were locking gas caps and I bought one because I wanted to go back and get the emissions tests over with. There are two things I do not like about the cap I bought that day: 1. Ever since I started using it, my gas mileage has gone down, and, 2. It doesn\u2019t have the strap to connect it to the car, so I have to hold it. I never use the locking feature because the car is always parked in the garage when we are at home, so I\u2019m going back to a cap that attaches to the car.This cap fits my 2016 Sorento. The knob on the attachment handle fits in the gas cap with no issues and was easy to install. The attachment connector is too short, but otherwise it fits well. There is barely enough length for the gas cap to reach the gas door to hang it there when pumping gas. Aside from that, it works well. I haven\u2019t had the issue with the loose cap or clicks that other users have had, so it might be dependent on the car model.I\u2019ve only been driving with it a short time, but I haven\u2019t gotten any codes thrown on my car and my gas mileage is back to what it was before I replaced the original gas cap. This is a nice replacement that seems to be almost exactly like the OME cap (aside from the short attachment piece).",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new gas cap for my 2002 Dakota, as the aftermarket one I had been using did not seem to ever fit well, so I ordered this one.It looks very similar to the original cap, including the plastic retaining cable, which the last aftermarket one did not have and I missed having. It took some effort to get the cable end fully snapped into the hole on the gas cap door hinge, but I finally did it using the old gas cap to press on it instead of my cold fingers.I was very concerned at first, as the cap would go on and click several times, but the top part of the cap wobbled around a good bit. When I tried to remove the cap it almost came off in my hand, it was on so loosely (felt like the thread was barely engaging). I tried multiple times to make it screw down more tightly, but could not due to the looseness of the top cap. I drove the truck and when I tried removing the cap afterward there was no hiss and pressure surge like there should be with an appropriately fitting cap. It almost fell off in my hand again. I finally pushed it on as hard as I could and decided to get back to it the next day.The next day I drove the truck a good bit and decided to try the cap one more time before I sent it back. To my surprise, it was on firmly and came off appropriately! I tried putting it back on and taking it off several more times and it worked as it should every time (spins on farther and seats down harder than it originally did). Since then it has been fine. Maybe the gasket needed to compress a bit? I don't know. Just know if you have the same issue to keep trying before you send it back. It's working fine now.",

                "reviewText": "Used this to replace the OEM gas cap, which was 16 years old. There was a small hiccup with the replacement process, but that had to do with the old retaining strap and not the new cap/strap combo. Fortunately, I determined that I did not have to remove the still functional strap from the fuel door and thanks to the design of the new cap I was able to simply pull the cap end out of the old cap, remove the new strap from the new cap to save for a later date if necessary, and plug the end of the old strap into the new gas cap. So far it works fine. No leaks or pressure issues in the fuel system. Good choice for a replacement.",
