No idea about longevity but will update reviews if there is an issue. Purchase package is for 5 bulbs, panel requires 3, so 2 are now spares. $8.00 well spent.Found installation tips in reviews for similar bulbs. Removed radio cowl and the AC/Heater control panel from dash. Then removed the panel's rear plastic cover (2 screws and 6 tabs). Removed existing bulbs with small needle nose pliers. by pressing down and rotated slightly counter clockwise. Lubed contacts on printed circuit board with DeOxit CP (my go to lube for electrical contacts). Then lubed the new bulb's mounting tabs with a minute quantity of SuperLube. Installed with the pliers by pressing the bulb down on the circuit board, and turning the bulbs gently clock wise. Remounted rear cover and tested. One inoperable bulb, so removed it, turned 180 degrees and re installed it. Everything was then 100%",
