                "reviewText": "The description does not specifically list the 2023 Ram 1500 (new body style) as compatible, but I ordered them anyway hoping to be lucky enough that they would work. As a matter of fact, they can fit, but they won't fit out of the box without some medium level MacGuyver-ing. These hooks are designed to use 2 bolts per each tow hook for installation. One bolt for each side is already on the truck, and the other bolt is included in the packaging with the hooks. My best guess is that on the 2022 and older Ram trucks the bolt that is already on the truck will come all the way out when you loosen it. The 2023 however will not. It has some kind of retaining device that keeps it in the frame even when its all the way loosened. Because of this, the large washers on the rubber grommets (that come with the tow hooks) must be cut to fit around the truck bolts before installation. Essentially making the large washer more of a large 'C' shape so that it will fit around the bolt sideways during installation. If you have a good metal saw and a steady hand, this takes only a few minutes.On another note, some of the reviews mention that installation is easy. I am guessing the 2022 Rams have a lot less junk installed underneath the front end than the 2023 Ram's do. Because of all the things you have to reach around on the 2023 model, installing these is a little more trouble than I was expecting. However, once done. they do look good and feel very sturdy. I would recommend them.",
