The default frequency for most high-frequency memory is SPD speed, but players can reach the official frequency by using a compatible motherboard and CPU and turning on the XMP/EXPO function in the motherboard BIOS. Why can't I start after installation? DDR5 requires a few minutes of self-test after initial installation, and the screen will remain black. It is recommended to insert high-frequency memory into the 2/4 slot group. 4 sticks of memory must run at the default frequency to run stably. How does this product work with AMD and INTEL motherboards? AMD platforms cannot exceed 6000MHz and will become unstable if exceeded. Intel platforms have different overclocking capabilities. If you adjust some parameters yourself and experience instability, you can restore the BIOS default settings.",

                "reviewText": "Works as advertised. Timings are slower than desktop DDR5 but then they almost always are. It's rare to find good laptop memory with timings as tight as a desktop without paying an arm and a leg so most companies choose to overclock lesser memory and loosen the timings to make it work. In the end you have less responsive memory than you might like but the truth is, more memory is better than faster memory (within reason of course). With DDR5 having incredible sizes (Sticks from 64GB-512GB are currently available) the speed starts to become secondary. Not for video gamers but for everyone else. You would rather have ECC in a workstation than super fast non ecc for instance. You'd rather have faster, non ecc memory in a gaming rig for several reasons(even though I prefer ECC). In the end this stick worked just fine at its rated speed and timings. It's a bit overpriced for what you get so I gave it 4 stars.",

                "reviewText": "My Accellerator DDR5 Laptop Memory was exactly what I needed to upgrade my laptops RAM. The computer immediately recognized it and it worked without any issues.(be sure to verify if your laptop has upgradable ram or an additional RAM a lot).I\u2019m using a Dell running windows 11 and it seemed to slow down when running multiple screens for work and having 5+ webpages open. Now I can seamlessly work without any delays. Sometimes I get a little lag when accessing my File Explorer but it was a night a day difference.Luckily my computers RAM speed was 4800mhz and now runs with the upgraded memory. Ultra fast and super affordable. If you have an upgradable RAM slot or can swap your old one out, make sure to get 2-4 of these and give your laptop a boost.To make sure that you get the speed from your RAM you will need to go into your BIOS and change the speed of your RAM. It\u2019s always on default unless you change it. If you\u2019re unsure what this is, have your local Computer shop install the ram and adjust the BIOS.5 stars \u2b50\ufe0f and affordable!",

I ordered another SK Hynix stick and they worked well together so I suspect this will work well with another Micron stick so you could order two of these or if your current memory is Micron based it would be no problem.It is always better to make sure your memory sticks are matched anyhow to avoid any potential issues.But on its own, it works as advertised and at a really good price.5/5",

                "reviewText": "As the title says, I typically stick with one brand when it comes to ram cards and that's the \"crucial\" brand which you can find on Amazon all day. They are basically a smaller company of a bigger company just at a cheaper price very dependable card. When I got this one in particular, I knew I was taking a chance and I ended up being pleasantly surprised. It's functioning great, I am now rocking 16gb of at DDR5 ram in a gaming rig and it's doing super well. I haven't had any performance issues; I haven't had any problems of any kind for that matter. It's a simple plug and play product and very easy to install with the proper tools. This product gets four stars. I think it's doing well, and I will give it 5 stars if it lasts more than six months which I think is fair because it's too early to tell it needs to be used for a period of time and hold up to the stress of video editing or gaming or whatever the case may be. I have heard of this company before acclimator and it's always been a mixed bag as far as reviews but on my end, I will say so far just adding this little bit of extra ram has been a big help. Also keep in mind you cannot mix and match ram, for those that don't know. It depends on your motherboard really at the end of the day, but in most cases you're either going to run DDR4 or DDR5 so don't get this thinking you can put it in your laptop or gaming rig that's running DDR4 ram at 3200 Hertz and this is DDR5 running at 4800. So, we shall see right now it's starting off very good and it's definitely a good product I could recommend it. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
