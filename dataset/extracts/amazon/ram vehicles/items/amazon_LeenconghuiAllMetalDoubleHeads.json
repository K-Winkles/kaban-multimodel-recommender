                "reviewText": "I have been using RAM Mounts on my Toyota 4Runner to mount my cell phones, amateur radios, TPMS display for the trailers and even a tablet computer. One of the biggest problems is getting the right angle or range of motion of the RAM arms. This double-ball allows two RAM arms to be used together to create compound angles and to find that \"just right\" spot to mount my accessories.This \"double ball\" for the ram mounting system is well made, solid and seems as or more heavy duty than the original RAM part. I've been using this on the truck for over a month and the radio it supports won't even vibrate! The texture on the ball surfaces allows better grip by the sockets they fit into. This is a good design and well executed. I've purchased several more over the past few weeks.I would definitely get this again and would recommend it to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "I needed an item like this about seven years ago, so I 3D-printed one because I couldn't find one on the RAM Mounts website. While that print continues to work to this day, I have never fully trusted it because it's clearly not RAM-quality. I'm happy to replace it with this professionally-manufactured version from Leenconghui.I have no doubt this all-metal \"double head\" adapter will last just as long as all my genuine RAM components. It is machined very well, and works perfectly for my needs in stationary settings. However, your experience may vary if used on an off-road rig... I have no concerns about the adapter breaking, but even though it has textured ball ends, they lack the rubberized coating of genuine RAM balls. This means that when secured to the same tightness as RAM balls, it is possible to move the double socket arms at either end with some force; even when tightened to the maximum level I'm comfortable with, it is still possible to move them with some effort -- in challenging off-road terrain, this may lead to your setup drifting downward over time, particularly when used to mount a heavy component. But... To be fair, I have to admit that I have not gone off-roading with this adapter, and this is pure speculation on my part.I think this adapter is a must-have for anyone with a bin-full of RAM Mounts, particularly for use in stationary or low-impact moving applications. But if you're expecting a bumpy ride, you may want to check if RAM makes an official version, first.",
