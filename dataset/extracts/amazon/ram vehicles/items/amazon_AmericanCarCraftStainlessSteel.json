                "reviewText": "The other reviews are correct. There\u2019s a sharp edge on the outside and it\u2019s just a mite too big. I\u2019m not that picky. I think it looks good. If you get the Ram one you need to decide if you want the Ram\u2019s head straight up in Park, or another gear like Drive. I chose park, so as I\u2019m driving the head is sideways. Again who cares. It\u2019s just a cool way of taking something that is just blank and black, and jazzing it up a bit. I say yes. I\u2019d buy again.",
