The price was very good as similar items for OE replacement were much more costly. Not sure of the warrenty time frame on this item. It did fit and function on installation day. Need more info on the supplier as I would reccomend them to my friends. I am trusting that this replacement will hold up and last in my truck. Thank You, OLB",
