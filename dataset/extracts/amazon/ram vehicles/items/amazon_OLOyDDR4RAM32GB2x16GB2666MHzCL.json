                "reviewText": "We bought these for our kids new 11\u201d Dell Inspiron 3100 laptops they got for Christmas as there wasn\u2019t enough memory installed to download everything they wanted, however this is not what these cards do! That is our fault though as we saw \u201cmemory\u201d cards and made the assumption it gave the computers more memory/storage. These actually speed up the computer to run faster. We did notice a difference in speed after installing them but we didn\u2019t notice a huge difference as the brand new laptops were barely used before installing them so it\u2019s hard to say exactly. They were really easy to install, on ours it was basically just removing 8 screws and the bottom cover.",
