                "reviewText": "Mine started not blowing air in my pilot did some research on the web and found out that it's the AC blower. Seen a youtube video on how to replace it and bought it off amazon. Much more quite then stock install was super easy all you will need is a 8mm socket. I was done with the whole thing in record time of 20 mins. Tested and it works fine. Not sure how long it's going to last but for the price I think I'll be ok. I would recommend to do it yourself and save yourself some money.",
