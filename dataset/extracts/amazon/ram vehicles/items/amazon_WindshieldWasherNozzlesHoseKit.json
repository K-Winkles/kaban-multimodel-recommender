My 2015 1500 Big Horn required one tee fitting and about half of the tubing in addition to the spray nozzles of course. The original tubing made a connection at the hood hinge area. That is where the new tubing was attached to the old. The old tubing had a barbed end, so attaching the new tube was easy. Removal of the old spray nozzles was easy because they broke apart as I attempted to remove with needle nose pliers. The most difficult task was removing the blanket anchors.",

With a little extra work I could make it fit my vehicle, even though it's supposed to fit my vehicle (per Amazon), and it sprays really strong. The only thing to note is that it sprays more of a stream and not a fan. With a little jb weld or something you can shape the hole to make the spray pattern work however you need.

The nozzles work great although I will say they did spray further down than I would have liked and they're not adjustable. The hose that it came with is really flexible which I really liked. I wish an L shaped connector would have been included as well.",

                "reviewText": "Package arrived and when I went to install one of the sprayers fell apart. Looked at the adhesive pattern and only a small amount was applied. I used some super glue and glued it. After I assembled the kit on the car and attempted to use the system the second one fell apart. Same issue. Glued that one. It\u2019s not a fan type sprayer either it\u2019s a focused on one area kind of spray pattern. If your looking for a cheap fix that you\u2019ll have to maintain this may be your product, but I would not recommend. After a week the drivers side stopped spraying. I haven\u2019t had the time or energy to investigate. Planning to buy an OEM replacement kit to replace this cheap knock off.",
