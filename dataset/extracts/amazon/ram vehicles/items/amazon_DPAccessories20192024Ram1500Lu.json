The OEM lug nut is the same for 2019-2023 Ram 1500 Classic models, you'll just have 4 spare lug nuts if you purchase this set. You can also change to the \"2012-2018 Factory Wheel\" option at the top of this page for a 5-lug kit of these lug nuts. Are these lug nuts the same length as the OEM lug nuts? They look taller. Good eye! At 1.65\" they are about 1/8\" taller than stock. We do this to match the internal depth on the factory capped lug nuts. They will stick out of the wheel a little more than stock, but we think they look great. Is the black finish matte black? Gloss black? Does the chrome rust? We call our black plating a satin finish, right in the middle of matte and gloss. Black and chrome platings have been upgraded to pass extended corrosion tests and will look great for years with only a little cleaning when they get dirty. Will these fit ALL 2019-2024 Ram 1500 aluminum wheels? What about factory steel wheels with a center cap? These lug nuts are designed to directly replace OEM part# 6509422AA. If that's the lug nut you have now, these will work! If your lug nuts hold on a wheel cover or if there is a cap that covers your lug nuts these are not compatible. Can I use an impact wrench with these lug nuts? How much torque can they take? Impact wrenches are no problem for hardened steel and our plating! Just don't over-do it, this isn't Nascar. Too much torque is not better, so use a torque wrench to tighten to the torque spec recommended in your Owner's manual.",
