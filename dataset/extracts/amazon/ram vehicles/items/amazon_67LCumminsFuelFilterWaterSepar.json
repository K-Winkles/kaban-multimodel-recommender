For the money ($40 ish) you can\u2019t go wrong! Both filters took about an hour to replace with clean up. Save yourself some money and go with these!",

                "reviewText": "These filters are a great deal for the price. I don\u2019t use the oil filter as I prefer a Wix or Mopar however for the cost I swap these out every 3 or 4 months or when the indicator pops up whichever is sooner. The only issue I have had is occasionally the bottom plastic portion of the engine filter comes off upon removal and you have to fish it out. It\u2019s easy to remove by hand but you have to be paying attention when you remove the spent filter. As far as longevity I get the same life out of these as Mopar filters. Considering a fuel filter change at the dealer is over $400 these require 30 minutes of my time and $40 it\u2019s a no brainer.",
