                "reviewText": "This has wound up being the perfect solution for mounting my iPad mini in a Cessna 172! I like using ForeFlight in the cockpit for planning routes, looking up frequencies and other airport info, terrain avoidance info, jotting down quick notes and clearances, and general situational awareness. I find ForeFlight to be much quicker to interact with than the G1000 for most quick tasks. While I was using a RAM suction mount to mount the iPad on the side windshield glass, just to the left of the instrument panel, I much prefer using this to mount it to the yoke!Yoke mounting really puts the iPad in the perfect position to interact with and view throughout the flight. If you turn the iPad mount upside down, the iPad fits perfectly over the yoke without blocking the view of any of the instruments. This mount does not interfere with the yoke movement or yoke mounted button access in any way. ForeFlight (and any other iPad app) automatically orient themselves the right way, so doesn't matter that the iPad is technically upside down.The mount feels solid (like all other RAM products I've used) and is easy and quick to take on and off the yoke (assuming you're renting and can't just leave it in place all the time). Once attached, it stays firmly in place until you take it off, without any noticeable movement or vibration. While I am using it with an iPad mini, I'd imagine it would also work just fine for the standard size iPad. The larger 12\" iPad Pro would probably be too big.As a little bonus, I scanned my checklist into the iPad and imported it into ForeFlight, so I can now very quickly flip between my checklists, approach or departure charts, scratch pad, map, etc, without having to shuffle around any paperwork or reaching around the cockpit to pull out my checklists during busy phases of flight. Of course, I have the physical checklists with me in my bag, and have access to most of the other info through the G1000, just in case anything went wrong with the iPad.",

                "reviewText": "Really easy to mount on a circular surface - pipe, tube, rod. It doesn't take much space, however, the clamp grips the tube really well, due in part to its rubber coating. One little inconvenience I've found is, it takes some time to use it on large diameter tubes - the user has to spread the jaws sufficiently wide for the tube to pass through. (IMHO, this is because the tightening screw has a fine pitch.) However, if the user ignores such inconvenience, (s)he is rewarded with a secure grip on the tube. The other use is on an edge, for example, the edge of a table. Here, again, the user ends up with a secure grip. All in all, this is a great gripping claw. If only the mechanism would work a little faster!",

Super easy to adjust, move, remove...get this if you like your items to be easily moved...DO NOT get this if you are looking for security, it's easily removed - which is what I wanted so I could just take it off or move positions in the vehicle. I float this between three vehicles so I love how easy it comes off...but I would never leave it in an open or unlocked vehicle as it would be stolen as easy as I move it to another vehicle. This is typical RAM quality - it's made to last!",

                "reviewText": "Ram Mount products have been making my life easier since I first discovered their products almost fifteen years ago when I needed a solution to securely mount a GPS in a light twin-engine airplane that would not send it flying when the weather got a little (or a lot) rough. This Tough-Claw (size small) is another fine example of the quality that Ram is known for. I chose this attachment to attach to the leg of a computer table for the purpose of mounting an external hard drive out of sight (underneath the table, but off the floor). It locks down very securely and holds my hard drive nice and tight, and that's alright! Highly recommend this clamp. I'm even looking at the medium size, but don't have an application where I'd need the larger size...yet! But you can bet your bippy that once I find one, I'll get it with zero hesitation. Can't say enough about Ram Mounts products, except thank you for making such awesome stuff!!Not really a disclaimer: I purchased this item with my own hard-earned money and have no affiliation with the Ram Mounts company. Also because I haven't figured out how to get free stuff to review like all of the \"cool\" reviewers on Amazon. But I don't care, because Ram Mounts are AWESOME! Cheers!",
