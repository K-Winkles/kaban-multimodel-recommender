                "reviewText": "These sticks of ram are great. My only issue is one of the sticks has an LED that, at least in Asrock Polychrome, is stuck in a pinkish shade with most colors but seems fine in blue. I would drop it a star rating for that but some confused people have given some really bad reviews so I figure this will balance it out.Regarding the reviews about CL16 vs CL18 the reviewers didn't notice the change when they moved from 3200mhz to 3600mhz, FYI 3600mhz at CL18 is going to be better by a small amount.Also, there are some reviewers saying they can't run it at 3600mhz and are frustrated by that. You need to check the specs of your CPU. Many low-middle tier models from a year or so back can't run ram this fast, maybe if you do some overclocking. I have the Ryzen 5 1600AF and it's rated for ram up to 2667mhz so the fact that I can run it with ram at 3200mhz is a blessing. Also, it's possible your motherboard can't handle it, but that is a rare issue... Of course, maybe it's the ram, but that's doubtful.",
