I know my motherboard only supports up to 2,993mhz without overclocking, so buying a 3,600mhz version of the Trident Z Neo was a bit of an overkill, but I am hoping that it will be a great option for when I buy an upgrade in the future.I previously had a single 8gb Ballistix Sport LT 3,000mhz CL-15 installed that was very good for how limited its capacity was, but when I installed these 16gb x 2 Trident Z Neo's my computer's speed was turbo-charged and fast as lightning. I could have 20+ tabs open and still not use 60% of the RAM storage, play graphic intensive games while running 3-4+ other low-to-moderately intensive programs in the background without any hiccups or slow processing times, my computer temps are lower, and my FPS rate improved by 10-15 frames!Note: I eventually got them to work by resetting the CMOS and install the 1st stick alone, powered on the computer, then powered it off and installed the 2nd stick, turned it back on and my computer POSTed again.",

                "reviewText": "Main Review:I am new to PC Build; so I did a lot of research to figure out everything needed to build a high speed gaming/work PC. Memory (RAM) happens to be one of the key components for any PC build and with AMD Ryzen 3rd Gen CPUs(ranging from 3700X - 3900X) I found out that they are super picky with RAM to get the desired optimal performance. I purchased this G.Skill Trident Z Neo(F4-3600C16D-32GTZNC) because it is specifically optimized for X570 motherboards when paired with Ryzen 3000 processors. (source:G.SKILL website). I paired it with a MSI MAG X570 Tomahawk motherboard and AMD Ryzen 9 3900X processor and am pretty happy with the performance; the speeds are incredible.Specifications:Your motherboard dictates the RAM compatibility and each motherboard manufacturer has a QVL(Qualified Vendor List) which is available either on their website / documentation; so, please check that out for compatibility before deciding. These RAM modules are rated at 3600 MHz; PC4-28800, 288 pins; CL=16 latency; 1.34v with 16-19-19-39. The height of the memory slot is 44mm (1.73 in) for those wondering if it will fit in your case. The memory chip has a temp sensor embedded on it for tracking the temps in some motherboards and when running diagnostics. I have a MSI MAG X570 TOMAHAWK motherboard and this RAM is 100% compatible and I got 2 sticks of 16 GB each totaling 32 GB.RGB Colors:The default RGB colors on the RAM are very attractive and have an array of rainbow colors which are nice to look at and are not super gawdy as they have a matte look to them; and the lighting is software controllable if one wants to sync them across all the other RGB devices within the PC; and it needs a separate software (in my case it's MSI Dragon/Mystic Light) that need to be downloaded from the motherboard manufacturer website and it supports various motherboard manufacturers and other 3rd party softwares.Ram Speeds:When you first install any RAM on the motherboard they are designed to default to the lowest configured frequency which is 2200 MHz to prevent any damage to the hardware. One needs to go into the BIOS setup(press DEL key during boot) to change the memory profile to the XMP profile. The process may be slightly different with other motherboards but with MSI motherboards the option is right on the main page denoted as \"A-XMP\". I enabled this option and was able to obtain the published speeds of 3600 MHz without any problem. When I did this and booted my machine I noticed a sudden jolt of speed increase due to the frequency change from 2200 MHz to 3600 MHz.Overall, I highly recommend this memory to anyone that is using X570 Chipset with AMD Ryzen CPUs without any hesitation; as I felt that speed and performance are very superior when I used it with X570 chipset with Ryzen 3900X processor.",

MSI comes with easy 1-button XMP profile initiation. Crash. Huh? Try resetting bios again. Crash. Turn off XMP. No issues. Try again. Crash. And again. Crash. You get the picture.Didn't have a problem with 16GB 3200 Ballistics. What gives?Ready to write a 1-star review. Gave XMP one more chance. It didn't crash. Ran Prime95 for 24 hours. Stable. So was it my bios that was faulty? Did the RAM need time to warm up? Don't know. But it works. Can't tell if it's much faster, but having the extra memory is nice. And it is finally at a decent price. The lights are pretty too.",
