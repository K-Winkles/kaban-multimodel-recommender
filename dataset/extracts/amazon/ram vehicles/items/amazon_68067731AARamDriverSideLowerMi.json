Hold the convex mirror against your side mirror and move it around until you have achieved the optimal location; make a note of that location. The Advantages of Convex Mirrors Convex side view mirrors are slightly curved and thus provide a wider angle of visual space. They help to eliminate most blind spots and let you see a bigger area than common flat glass mirrors. Thus, you are able to see much more than with regular flat mirrors. Convex mirrors are often used on bigger or longer vehicles because flat glass mirrors cannot cover enough space to see past a big car. Therefore, they are a good choice for SUVs, Caravans, Trucks, or large 4\u00d74 vehicles. What's the best way to replace a side mirror? Start by finding your replacement mirror. There are two types of replacement mirrors\u2014snap-on and stick-on. This will help you determine whether the backing plate behind the glass needs to come out as well.",
