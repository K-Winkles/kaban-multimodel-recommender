The lights are a sickly yellow instead of the white the OEM parts come with. You can't let the passenger window and driver window up at the same time. The mirror light is red instead of white, and is always on.That said, it does work. It comes with everything you need to install it correctly, and only takes about 5 minutes to pop the old one out and the new one in.All of the window switches worked right out of the box. The auto raise/lower for the front passenger and driver side window works fine. The mirror controls work fine.If you want something that just works and won't break the bank; go for this. If you want something fancy, get something pricier. When/if I need to replace this, I'll order the same part again.Unless I can find one with RGB lights; I'm a sucker for RGB lights on products.
