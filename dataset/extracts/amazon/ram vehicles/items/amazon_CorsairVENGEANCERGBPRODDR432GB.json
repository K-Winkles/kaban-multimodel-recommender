                "reviewText": "Like most ram modules you just plug these modules into the motherboard. If the left most slot you want to call number 1 and then 2,3, and 4, then......remove old RAM and install these 2 new modules in slots 2 and 4.Check online your motherboard manual to see for sure if this is the case on your board. It is on the big majority.Also, check the top specs your motherboard can run. Mine can only run up to 3200 Mhz so this is what I purchased. Also mine could only...... take ram modules up to 16 GB. So I put in two modules of 16 GB for a total of 32 GB. This was to replace my old ram total = 16 GB.Without connecting any wires or downloading or installing any software, the RGB will produce a really nice looking multicolored waterfall ...... effect. You only need the software if you want to change the RGB show to something else.This is a top brand of RAM. It pays to buy name brand quality!Although some may not know, the best, most trouble free, and top performance usually happens with exactly 2 modules in your......motherboard's 4 slots. Next best is 1. Then 4. Then 3. So two 16 GB = 32 total is a better idea than one 32 GB module. It will run faster......almost always.When putting more than one module in a computer make sure all of them are the same type and model number of the same brand...... that way it is much more likely to work trouble free without problems.",

They light up pretty well but they don't work well together with RGB fusion (Gigabyte's lighting program) so that's a negative for me. So even if I manually control the RAM's color lighting using iCue (Corsair's lighting program) they are still gonna get messed up by RGB fusion so just keep that in mind 'cause I haven't found the sweet spot for them or at least found a resolution up to this day.In any case, I'm pretty happy with my purchase and I wish I had bought the 2x16 GB originally so that I won't be needing to return the 2x8GB RAM that I bought.
