The installation process was a breeze, involving only about 10 screws and to secure the new module in place. Although the first reboot required a bit of patience, the system now operates seamlessly at full speed. This RAM is a limited to find and a valuable addition to my setup.",

I may buy a second one to bring the system to 64GB, but for now 40 is more than enough. Not the cheapest option available, but it worked without issue and that is definitely worth it for me.",

                "reviewText": "My laptop originally arrived with only 16GB DDR5 RAM, and Windows 11 required just over half that for itself. I needed a lot more for flight simulation, truck simulation, and VR games (not to mention productive tasks, lol). Laptop BIOS adjusted the memory itself, no need to remember what that special key is to do it manually. Everything from booting up to running apps is a lot faster, and I don't have to worry about apps crashing because they maxed out the memory. It's perfect for my mid-level gaming laptop! Easy for me to install, though I do have a lot of experience upgrading and repairing computers and laptops. Lots of YouTube videos to teach how to install in just about any laptop it is designed for, and computer tools are fairly inexpensive now. If you are up for upgrading yourself (or have a teen at home, lol), this is definitely worth every penny.",

                "reviewText": "The manufacturer MINISFORUM, said the Venus Series UM790 Pro Mini PC would take a maximum of 64 gigabytes of Ram. Every review just doubled down on this limitation, but I found a post on the internet that said it worked for them, and I decided with Amazon's return policy that it was worth the gamble. Happy I did, they are wonderful. I put several days of running low level assembly language memory tests and they all pass with flying colors. The UM790 shares video processing with the cpu, so extra memory allows me to set aside 16 G for video and 80 G for cpu use. This little (5 inch x 5 inch x 2 inch) computer runs at about 10 watts so there is little need for a big desk top computer these days. At 78 years old, I remember using an Apple II with 16 k of Ram with a tape recorder for program storage. Life is good.",
