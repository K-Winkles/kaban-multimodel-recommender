However, I then went into the BIOS and changed the settings to 6400MHz. I did not use the XMP. If you use the XMP with this motherboard it will cause problems. After changing the BIOS to 6400MHz, the system did not boot. This happened to me before, so after 1 minute, I did a shut down by pressing the shut down button.After you power up the system from the cold boot, the system should run normal and recognize the 64GB and the 6400MHZ. System is running smooth after 6 hours.SYSTEM SPECS:MOTHERBOARD: Gigabyte Z790 AORUS ELITE AXCPU: Intel Core i9-13900KRAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz CL32GPU: Nvidia RTX 4080 FEAIO: NZXT Kraken Elite 280 RGBSSD 1: Samsung 990 Pro NVMe PCIe M.2 2TBSSD 2: Samsung 980 Pro NVMe PCIe M.2 2TBSSD 3: Samsung 980 Pro NVMe PCIe M.2 2TBPSU: MSI MPG A1000G PCIE 5 & ATX 3.0CASE: MUSETEX 9 RGB Fans ATX Mid-TowerMONITORS: 2 G34WQC Gaming Monitors",
