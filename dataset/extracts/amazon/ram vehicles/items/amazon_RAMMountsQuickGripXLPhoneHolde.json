                "reviewText": "Bought the Quick-Grip for an S20 FE. I also have an X-Grip, bought a couple of years ago for another phone. I find the Quick-Grip far more secure for car or bike installation, and the X-Grip better for holding my phone on my desk, for example when making video calls, reading instructions when I needed both hands, etc. I reviewed the comments in depth before buying the Quick-Grip, and I'll address what I found myself now that I have one.Material and assembly: This is not cheap construction. I have been using Ram mounts for GPS units for years and none have broken or given me trouble. The materials are strong, and if you are breaking it during assembly or use, you are using too much force. Mine came with multiple length screws for assembly, so you will be able to adjust for your situation. I used the medium length screws so that the jam nuts were secure but the screws did not extend beyond the back of the case when assembled, for the ball and the side arms. Assembly was intuitive. Some may want more explicit instructions, but the pictogram instructions where more than enough for this simple product.Usefulness: The Quick-Grip is definitely more secure than an X-Grip in any vibration environment. The spring is quite strong, but I have no problem installing or removing the phone with one hand. Hook your index finger on a side support arm then press up and out on the bottom/center of the phone with your thumb. You do have to be careful or you might drop the phone when the bottom pops out of the case, but it's a learning experience and easy to do once you get the hang of it. Because the side arms have multiple slots you can choose for assembly, I have access to all screen functions, fingerprint sensor, side buttons and the charging port. The camera still works with one exception. Because of the multiple camera lenses, at 1X or greater, the camera works fine. At 0.5X (zooming out), there is a slight dark area at one edge of the image because of the wide angle view. Not an issue for me. My phone is mounted for ease of access to the phone functions, maps, navigation, etc, and not for photography. The X-Grip would be my choice if I wanted a mount just for photography. My older phone with a different camera layout works fine in the Quick-Grip. I think there was a review where someone had modified the Quick-Gripfor their needs. I don't see why this can't be done without compromising the integrity if that's what you want to do. I'm happy with it as is.Overall, the Quick-Grip is a great holder.",
