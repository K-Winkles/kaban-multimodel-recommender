Easy installation even I could replace it myself. However there are no instructions. But it's just so easy you don't need them. Exactly how you take off you old one it snaps right back into place. I still am saving up to replace the entire mirror because ours is broken on the outer casing . But for now I can use this to drive more safely. I recommend this \ud83d\udcaf I can't express how Good this purchase is. So happy I bought it. I gave up waiting because my husband kept saying he was gonna buy the entire thing. And I hate driving without my mirror. So 25.99 is not a bad investment at all. He was proud of me when I showed him I did it. Now I just need to clean up the tape and it works great. It's hooked up to the electrical outlets so it can be positioned with the door panel buttons. If your mirror needs to be replaced don't sleep on this. Buy it, you won't be disappointed and if you are it might be something else I didn't have to experience. Anyway buy it!",
