It was in the mid 40s outside, so the plastic cover was stiff but not frozen. I wouldn't want to try to install it if it was really cold outside. I had to remove the tape from the covers and use a rubber hammer to gently tap the edges to get the cover into place. As you can see in the attached picture, it isn't flush with the side rails. That's fine with me. It looks good.",
