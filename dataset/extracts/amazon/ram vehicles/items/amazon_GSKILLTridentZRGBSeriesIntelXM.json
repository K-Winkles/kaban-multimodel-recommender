I am using it with an AMD Ryzen 5900x and MSI motherboard, and it booted up immediately to its rated speed using the XMP profile, with Windows 11 detecting and utilizing it right from the first boot. I have been using it for several weeks now, and it has been entirely stable and functioning well, providing an excellent user experience.",
