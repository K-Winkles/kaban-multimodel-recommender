It's made a big difference in how well my computer works. If you want good RAM with helpful customer support, this 32GB kit is a good choice. I'd give it 5 stars for how well it works and 4 stars for the wet box thing. Overall, I'm happy with it.",

I ended up regretting this because my computer routinely crashed. This was a very annoying issue. After running some diagnostic tests, I discovered that my Silicon Power RAM had failed and was causing frequent crashes. This was after only a couple months of use.I ended up purchasing this Crucial RAM to replace it. Ever since the moment I installed this RAM, my computer has not crashed once. This RAM fixed all my problems and now my computer runs smooth and fast. I highly recommend this. I've been using it in my gaming PC now for a few months without issues. It is not RGB but I didn't want that.Do yourself a favor and don't cheap out on RAM like I did. This RAM is a good purchase and should last a long time. Crucial also has a good warranty unlike Silicon Power.",

                "reviewText": "I want to preface this review by saying:1. My computer would initially NOT BOOT AT ALL WHEN THESE STICKS WERE INSTALLED. But, once the computer restarted itself several times (like 3-4), a bios notification appeared, notifying me I might have incompatible settings, and to try the default settings. After confirming, the computer booted up fine(Note: I still have XMP enabled).2. I ran several tests on my sticks (with MT86+ and OCCT), and found no write/read errors at all. Several people reported they received bad sticks, so make sure you extensively test your sticks before your return date runs out!!Now,I bought mine for around 45$ (not including shipping), which is an EXCELLENT price for 32 gigs, even though the 22-22-22 timings are pretty bad. Having more memory is much better than having better timings.I did not run any benchmarks to see how \"worse off\" my output is with these new sticks, but I don't seem to have lost any frames while playing games, for an instance. Overall, I am pretty happy with the sticks.",

But it feels better in a smooth way instead of things being opened and you having to wait forever. This makes it feel less like that, maybe because more RAM the more usage can be met.My hopes is this product remains the same price and then I can buy a another pair and have 64GBs which is all I ever need.Thanks for making this product in high quality!",
