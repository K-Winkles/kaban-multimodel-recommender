We like the look, however, if we had known they were not side air bag compatible, we would have chosen another brand. There is no strap that goes under the seat from side to side to keep them from sliding around. I will have to sew one on. Otherwise, they are nice and heavy, look like they will hold up pretty well, if we can keep them secure on the seat.",
