                "reviewText": "SUMMARY: Right out of the box this ram worked great. It has proven fast, stable and consistent across all my benchmarks and testing. I included the info in the pics for Jedec, timings, chipsets and my benchmarks. The top bench at 4501 was with my 6 gig boost on.This RAM kit is awesome and works great! I think I finally found my RAM.DETAILS:I have been building computers for over 20 years. who cares. I am not a gamer nor an overclocker, but I am a performance fiend. I had maxed out my old MB at 64 gig and did some hardware updates and wanted to get more ram. Apparently it is difficult to get 4 sticks working together at least at a decent performance, so I was left updating to 96 gig instead of 128 like I wanted. Now I actually want 192 but thats another story.I have been on the hunt to increase my RAM from 64 gig for quite some time while keeping as much performance as possible. For ref I have a 13700k on a new Z790 ddr5 mobo which I had to get some inexpensive ddr5 ram for my initial build because I could not find the performance, soze and price I was looking for. Normally when swapping out ram I have to turn off the XMP and any other BIOS toggles I may have like low latency and gear2 settings. I was so excited to install this ram that I forgot to do that. My system booted right up with this new ram. Normally it doesnt like I said. My initial RAM bench was awesome. Not only that, there are several benches I do that sometimes have issues and this ram worked great across the board. I even turned on my 6 gig boost which normally causes a couple of benchmarks to get flaky. This RAM made everything work better and was more stable than my previous ram, plus I didnt have to spend hours testing and tweaking settings. I was even able to run all of my benchmarks at the 6 gig boost which normally there are a few that will crash the system. I am super pleased and super surprised at the performance and stability of this ram. Also. my CPU bench is more consistent at around 49500 instead of fluctuating. My ram performance has increased on the threading. I still get intermittent latency between 35 and 36 with the 36 being the norm. My ram bench has been consistent over 4300 and my gpu diectx9 bench has been performing more stable. My ram read writes are fast but not consistent. Overall, I am getting great performance, great consistency and better stability. This ram is performing better than my 5600 cl28 which was tweaked pretty good cuz thats how I roll. This being 6400 CL32 at faster MHZ but higher latency performs better out of the box with the same bench latency in the 35-36 range which is great IMO. Super happy that I am getting the performance I want with 96 GIG.I also performed memtest86 under separate BIOS settings only doing 4 passes under each setting. With Low latency enabled instead of Auto, it passed, With Low latency enabled and 6 gig boost on it passed. With High speed and Low latency both enabled instead of auto, it passed. With High Speed enabled and Low latency enabled and 6 Gig boost on , it failed. IMO these results are better than I expected as the 6 gig boost will sometimes fail out previous memory sticks. On my mobo, I get better performance when I change the low latency from Auto to enabled and with this ram I was also able to use the 6 Gig boost which greatly improves performance without any errors in the Memtest. For reference, other ram I have used has failed when 6 gig boost is on or even enabling high speed and low latency at the same time has resulted in failures. So this Ram is pretty awesome in my book. I have not even tried tweaking timings, voltage or speeds as the XMP performance and stability is great as is.So if you need ram for modeling or virtual machines or 3d or even gaming this is the best price/performance you can get. In my humble opinion",

                "reviewText": "My kit ICs is SK Hynix M-die (confirmed via \"HWINFO\"). I tried the 6400MHz XMP profile on my AMD 7950X CPU+AM5 build and I encountered a BSOD after a couple minutes running several \"TestMem5\" runs. I opted for a manual CL30 6000MHz and have been stable for weeks, which isn't surprising considering AM5's weak memory controller (compared to Intel 12th/13th gens).Considering I paid a few dollars more than the lower 5600mhz 96GB kit, I feel it's a great value for professionals that'll age well if you're committed to AM5 as future CPUs will likely support higher clocks.Regardless, if you're solely doing productivity workloads and/or won't enable XMP then opt for cheaper 96GB kits.",

                "reviewText": "Price is good and specifications are goos as well. But stability is questionable still: I am using 12900k and Z690 E-gaming. From the box this DDR5 started well, XMP was activated without any problems. And everything worked smooth almost for 1 day, then I got full freeze of PC screen (it happened in the moment of inactivity; I just got back to my PC and discovered that nothing responds to my actions, not keyboard nor mouse, though screen is active as it was before, showing all opened programs etc). So I had to hard reset it. Then updated BIOS to 2703. And run Windows memory test, which quickly showed that there were problems with hardware. Not sure what to do next. May be I\u2019ll test a bit further on XMP and see how it goes, may be will have to disable XMP for stability. Who knows, may be upcoming BIOS updates can somehow also help to improve stability of DDR5.Update. Tested every die one by one in Win test and MemTest86- each of them passed tests with no mistakes.Then tested two dies simultaneously in Win Memory test again - they passed successfully this time. After that I run MemTest86 for 2 dies - and it showed 2 errors.So not sure how to interpret this. Will test at work and see if there are more problems.",
