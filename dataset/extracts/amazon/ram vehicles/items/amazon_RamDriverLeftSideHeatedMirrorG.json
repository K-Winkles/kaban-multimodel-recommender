Still on and doesn\u2019t vibrate when you drive which happened before when I purchased a complete aftermarket side mirror before for another truck I used to own. Highly recommend this mirror if you just want to replace mirror. Comes w the clips which is what I wanted and one of the main reasons I purchased this.",

The clips worked fine. I only used one clip and reused one off the old one. Just an FYI. This mirror only has the ability to heat or defrost, it does not have the tenting ability that some (like my 13 ram came with from the factory). Those will run you a lot more than the cost of this one. But if you need a quick replacement this one works well. I have drove about 500 miles since installing and haven't had any shaking or problems with it. Works like the org. Just doesnt have the self tenting.",
