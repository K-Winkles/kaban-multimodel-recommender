I was so frustrated with my desktop, I was looking for a new one. I am sure glad I looked at upgrading my RAM. I took a chance and spent a few bucks on memory. I am so glad I did this, my computer is like new. Saved myself hundreds with just a small purchase. This memory was so easy to install, just plug and play. My old cranky computer did all the rest. Look at this as an option, the chips came packaged very well and in an anti-static guard. Absolutely love this memory and was super easy to install, was up in minutes and my screen went for blury to clear. Super happy!!!",

                "reviewText": "This memory was selected as an upgrade to a computer that already had memory installed. I did the research prior to ordering to determine the type, size and specification of memory that I could order for the computer I was upgrading in order to seamlessly max out the amount of memory that the computer could have installed and use, given the amount of memory (and its specs) that was already installed. Once I had the information that I needed to confidently order the product, I did so, and promptly installed and tested it after receipt before writing this review. The product that I ordered was exactly what was needed, and appears to be working without any problems, which speaks to its quality. I am very satisfied with this purchase; the product arrived well before the projected delivery date and in great condition. I will definitely order from this vendor if the need arises.",

                "reviewText": "While this will work in both 1.35v and 1.5v motherboards the product page isn't exactly clear on the fact that this is DDR3L (Low Voltage, 1.35v). I think the product description should be more clear.I'm currently testing my replacement set. The first kit I got worked great for about 3 days, and even passed 4 passes of memtest86. Then after waking from sleep 10 minutes before I was going to return the PC to it's owner, it did nothing but blue screen. Another quick Memtest86 run just turned the screen red with thousands of errors within seconds.UPDATE: After 2 days of running memtest86, Prime95, several sleep cycles, and reboots, I'm pretty confident that the replacement RAM is OK. This isn't the first time I've had problems with Crucial RAM, but these things can happen with RAM from any manufacturer.These went into a Dell Inspiron 660s, which unfortunately only supports running them at 1333MHz even though the original RAM was also 1600MHz. I went with the low density (chips on both sides) version because I read that there would be less potential compatibility issues and better performance.",
