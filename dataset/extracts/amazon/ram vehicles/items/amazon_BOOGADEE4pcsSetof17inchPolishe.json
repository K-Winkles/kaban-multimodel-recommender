                "reviewText": "First of all, those that complain about no instructions probably can\u2019t tie their shoe laces. Install couldn\u2019t be more self explanatory.Only downside I see besides the \u201ctool\u201d not being there(T handle screwdriver)and rubber washers to hold the lug nuts against the cap is that the 2 bolts that hold the outer cover on are kinda questionable. An Allen head or torx head would look better than a phillips that is supplied but the problem is there is no Loctite on the bolts. They thread in easy so I can see them coming out easy. To those that purchase these, put some blue Loctite on the bolts.The design is simple and works great. The shell that mounts on the rim is attached by 4 of the lug nuts that hold the rim, the outer hub portion holds to the shell with the 2 bolts I mentioned. Why the factory doesn\u2019t make them like this is plain ignorance because they know the plastic ends break off the factory caps everytime a cap is pulled off.The price looked too good to be true. $300 for all 4 compared to $1000 for the stock ones that break every other time they get pulled off.I\u2019m sold and will be purchasing these for the rest of my fleet.",
