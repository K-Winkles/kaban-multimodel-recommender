                "reviewText": "I ordered a multiple pairs of BRCOVAN (where do they come up with these names?) ball mount components, including handlebar clamps with 1\" balls, aluminum alloy diamond shaped bases with 1\" balls, 1/4\"-20 male threaded posts with 1\" balls, and double socket arms to connect the 1\" ball components together.I'm going to talk about all of them in this review because it's a system and many of you are no doubt considering purchasing other components, just as I did. I hope that's more helpful than just writing a line or two about the diamond ball bases that are the subject of this review.If you've ever bought, or even priced out, RAM Mounts brand ball mount components, you know that the price can climb rapidly as you assemble the various parts you need. These BRCOVAN components use the same ball diameter of 1\" that is used on the popular \"B size\" RAM Mounts product line. These are completely compatible with the genuine RAM Mounts B size components.The lock and hold just as well as the RAM Mounts brand products and cost only about half as much on average.These are not a compromise in quality at all. In fact, I think that the quality of the 1/4\"-20 ball adapters are even better quality than the RAM Mounts equivalent. The handlebar clamps are beautifully machined and finished aluminum and stainless steel. The wing knobs turns with buttery smoothness due to the precise, high-quality threads and smooth pivot points. The diamond base ball adapters have flawlessly machined and finished aluminum bases. The double socket composite arms are also nicer than the RAM Mounts brand becuase they employ dual springs with one per socket end. RAM Mounts have only a single one, causing the socket at the spring end to let go as you loosen the knob, but requiring that you manually release the other end.I don't have any hesitation in recommending these, and other BRCOVAN ball mount accessories. Everything I've seen so far leaves me extremely impressed and satisfied with their products.",
