                "reviewText": "These are already great out of the box, but i would dwell into OCing them and understanding the process to get the best bang for buck value. On the back of my sticks i have ver 8.35 which is nanya type(amazing for OC)As you see in my picture not only was i able to OC from stock 3600 to 3800m,hz i was also able to get good timings, dropping it from cl18 to cl16. Stable through test mem 5 with the extreme profile and with occt mem test as well both took like 2 days of stress testing and holding strong.I would say make sure to see which ver number you have on the back of your sticks before inserting them in so that you know which version you have to get a good idea of how good your sticks can OC if you wanted to in the near future.Just to point out i have a 5900x(with pbo2 settings) and a rtx 3070. In 3d time spy benchmark my cpu score jumped from 12000 to 15594 all by just overclocking my ram. Ive also notice huge fps performance in a lot of games that i play. Lots of value all from just tinkering my ram. Very happy with my results",

                "reviewText": "upgraded my computer's memory with two sticks of RAM, and it has significantly improved my system's performance. Below, I will outline the pros and cons of these RAM sticks based on my personal experience:Pros: Impressive 32GB Capacity: The inclusion of two 16GB RAM sticks has provided a substantial boost to my computer's memory capacity. With a total of 32GB, I can comfortably run memory-intensive applications, multitask effortlessly, and handle demanding tasks such as video editing, 3D rendering, and gaming without experiencing any slowdowns. Aesthetic Enhancement for an All White Build: These RAM sticks perfectly complemented my all white computer build, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication to the overall aesthetics. The clean and sleek design effortlessly integrates with the color scheme, creating a visually appealing setup. Vibrant and Eye-Catching Colors: The vibrant colors of the RAM sticks enhance the visual appeal of the interior components. Whether it's the heat spreaders or the LED lighting, the colors add a dynamic and captivating element to the overall look of the system. It's a delightful sight that adds personality to the build. Easy Installation: Installing these RAM sticks was a breeze. The sticks fit seamlessly into the RAM slots on my motherboard, and the installation process was straightforward. The user-friendly design ensures that even those with limited technical knowledge can successfully upgrade their system's memory.Cons: Higher Price Tag: While these RAM sticks offer excellent performance and aesthetic appeal, they may not be the most budget-friendly option on the market. The advanced features, larger capacity, and eye-catching design contribute to a higher price point compared to more basic RAM options. However, the enhanced performance and visual impact may justify the investment for those seeking a high-quality and visually pleasing upgrade.In summary, the two sticks of RAM provide a substantial boost to your computer's memory capacity, allowing for smooth multitasking and seamless performance, especially for resource-intensive tasks. The stylish design and vibrant colors enhance the visual appeal of your system, particularly in an all white build. The easy installation process ensures a hassle-free upgrade experience. However, it's worth noting that these RAM sticks come with a higher price tag compared to more basic options. If you prioritize performance, aesthetics, and are willing to invest in a premium RAM upgrade, these sticks are a fantastic choice for taking your system to the next level.",
