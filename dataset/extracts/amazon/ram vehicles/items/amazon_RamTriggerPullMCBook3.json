He thought he was helping and instead caused trouble for Eisley. Now their paths have crossed again. He won\u2019t mess up a second time. He is going to protect Eisley with everything he has. He doesn\u2019t care that she is a US marshal. The club will understand. Eisley\u2019s life is about to be turned upside down. Her current case seems to be connected to her past and she didn\u2019t even realize it at the time. When other members of her team are killed and she wounded she goes to Ram for help. Maybe there is more out there for her than just her job. She is learning that not everything is as it seems. This book was a great read. I love this MC so much. It was great to get to read about them again. Addy is a fantastic author. I hope to get to read more books about these characters in the future. Great job Addy.",

                "reviewText": "The suspense built for each couple despite each book being able to be read as stand alone. This one really came out of left field with the plot. Yes, it's biker meets hot chick, biker wants to own hot chick, but OMG, the background and history of the two main characters builds.I hope there are other books following that perhaps cover some of the MC members lost or new ones found for this or Rebel Rage. Both series were great.The action and suspense in them was good, the build-up didn't give away everything so a few things surprised me when they happened.The level of devotion and caveman caring by the bikers over their old ladies is what makes these stories. This final one with Ram and Ellie was the crescendo you expected and makes your toes curl and your heart swell. It'll also have you snuggle up to your significant other if he's as devoted as Ram.",

He and Elly have history and being with her is his top priority. If only he can keep her safe so he can claim her for forever.I enjoyed this story and while reading the previous installments isn\u2019t necessary, it will give you some back story or the characters and some previous issues that are related.Great story..and I loved Ram and Elly, her sassiness was refreshing and watching her give in to Ram was sexy as hell.",

Ram and Eisley\u2019s story is full of plot twist and turns and a romance that was meant to be that you will not want to put this book down. Ram and Eisley loved each other since they were kids but due to miscommunication they went their separate ways not knowing how the other really felt about each other. When they meet again the sparks fly right off the pages. Ram was not passing up a second chance of love with Eisley. Eisley is a strong take no crap from anyone and I loved how Ram had her back and same with her. The relationship between the old ladies in the MC is great, they all have each other\u2019s back. I was kept of my toes throughout the whole book and loved every second of it. Trigger Pull MC is a must read series!",
