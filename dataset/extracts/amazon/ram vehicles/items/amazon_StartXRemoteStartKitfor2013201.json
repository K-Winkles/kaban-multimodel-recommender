Involves using your desktop to flash the little computer that comes with it. You basically wire it in, do some steps with the key. Then you remove it (three little clip on harnesses) and bring it in to your desktop, and run a program you download. THEN, you go back out, reconnect it and do a few more steps (turn key, watch for blinking light, turen key back...), and DONE. Actually works. Money well spent.",

                "reviewText": "Is about 10 months using this and most of the time works fine. Was easy to install. Is working fine.Few things that i found:*While truck was running, i unlocked the doors and i opened the left rear door and truck stopped. Not sure if that supposed to happen.*One other time i found my truck running and locked and i never started in the first place, so not sure at this point what happened.*As for if you have the truck running from the remote, and then you open the door the truck should stop in 45 sec. if you do not doing nothing (i mean put the keys in the ignition and turn it on, and foot on the brake pedal) - this never worked for me, will try again and update this if it works as their manual say.>But 95-98% works as it should.(Review done on 9/24/2023)",

                "reviewText": "Installed on a 2017 Ram 1500 CC with Tip Key. I have never installed a remote start kit.. I know the basics of vehicles, so this wasn\u2019t incredibly hard. If you know the basics, I would save the money and do it yourself. Shoot, even if you don\u2019t, save the money and DIY- it\u2019s not hard at all.1st off, I had to buy a used dell laptop from OfferUp since it\u2019s not supported for Mac laptops, which kind of sucked. However, that was probably way cheaper than getting it professionally installed.2nd, the instructions kind of sucked.. I had to re-read the instructions a few times since they were vague. Once understood, the install was a breeze. I had no hiccups during install. In fact, this is the easiest and smoothest aftermarket install I\u2019ve ever done on any vehicle. Make sure you use internet explorer or else it\u2019ll say it\u2019s not compatible. I\u2019d recommend this product to anybody wanting to do a DIY install. It\u2019ll take a little bit to get used to starting it, but I\u2019m so excited. Being in Arizona, it\u2019ll be nice to have remote start during 115+ summers and below 32 winter mornings. I never had to reach out to customer service or re flash the device. Just make sure you thoroughly follow the directions. My biggest complaint and improvement to the developer would be better instructions and to have an installation video guide to go along with.Update: I have since downgraded to a 1 star. After 3 months, suddenly my ECU did not recognize both of my key fobs. This messed with my computer system and left me stranded several times. Once I removed the product, my truck started working fine. It also caused computer glitches to have my truck driving at 5500 RPM at 45mph. Not sure what was going with this product.",

Install guide is written well, but video links provided in the manual are even better with step by step walkthrough with audio.All wires are inline connections, no need to hack your factory wiring harness. Everything tucks up nearly under my steering wheel.You do need access to a computer (PC or Mac) so you can flash the start module using a USB port.I highly recommend this product. A+++",
