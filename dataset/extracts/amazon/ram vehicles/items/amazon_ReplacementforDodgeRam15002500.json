These wiper blades have proven to be a fantastic aftermarket alternative for my 2009-2018 Dodge Ram.Installation was a breeze; the blades fit perfectly onto my vehicle's front window. They securely attach and provide a seamless connection, ensuring optimal performance during rainy and snowy conditions. The 22-inch size is ideal for my Dodge Ram, covering a significant portion of the windshield with each swipe.I highly recommend the \"Windshield Wiper Blades\" by OTUAYAUTO. They offer a perfect fit, outstanding wiping performance, durability, and quiet operation.",
