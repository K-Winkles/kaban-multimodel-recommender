The only issue I have is when I picked up the box at post office, it looked like the box had been thrown around like a basketball. There was no visible damage as the lights are packaged well. As a suggestion, maybe the box can be reinforced a little differently so someone does not get a damaged set of lights. Again, these lights exceeded mi expectations. I also purchased LED bulbs for the backup lights and they are bright as well. Thanks",
