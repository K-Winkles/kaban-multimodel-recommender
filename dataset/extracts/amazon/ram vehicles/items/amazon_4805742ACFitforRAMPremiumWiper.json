Installed very easily and it sprays exactly like my original sprayer.......UPDATE: As others have said, after roughly 4-5 times of use, the insides of the sprayer blew out, leaving the sprayer as a gusher. Seems to be a common issues with this product. Luckily i did not use the other sprayer and replaced it again, but I don't expect it to last any longer than the first one.Update 1-1-2024.... second sprayer blew out as well after about the third time used. Terrible product.",
