Starting with the packaging and the shipping, the item arrive quickly, and everything was neat and well put together. Regarding the installation process, let\u2019s start with the instructions. They were printed in color and in a decent size font. Next, to install the items took very little time to do. This is my first time replacing my tail lights and if I could put a time on it, I would say it took me 20 minutes tops to take out my current tail lights and put the new ones on. The features that I like the most about this item is that it came with the bulbs already pre-installed, and they provided you with a set of gloves to use. This is a plus considering that I am not super keen on getting my hands really dirty unnecessarily. Overall, I would give this product a five out of five for presentation, ease of installation, and functionality of the product.",
