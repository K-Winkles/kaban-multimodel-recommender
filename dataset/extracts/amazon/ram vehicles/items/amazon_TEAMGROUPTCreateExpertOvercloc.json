                "reviewText": "I've only used Teamgroup's products once and had a positive experience, but I was still hesitant to buy one of their RAM kits as I've only had that 1 experience which was an SSD. So, I would've normally gotten one of the well known and trusted GaMeR bRo marketed kits from Corsair or G.Skill. But, this has, or at least it did, the tightest timings of any other kit at this frequency and I technically had no reason to think poorly of Team and I once again, have to commend them for a solid product. As long as this kit doesn't die any time soon, Team is well on its way to becoming a brand I highly recommend.Also, yes, this is a \"gaming\" kit, RAM is RAM, the only reason companies use the word gaming is simply for aesthetics and to use as a buzzword. Seat these modules, turn on EXPO in bios, you're GTG. And avoid Team",

                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded my desktop with the TEAMGROUP T-Create Classic 10L DDR5 32GB Kit, and it's been a game-changer. The 6000MHz speed is incredibly fast, making everything from gaming to multitasking feel smoother and more responsive. Compatibility with both Intel XMP 3.0 and AMD Expo is a big plus, ensuring it works seamlessly with my setup. With 32GB of RAM, I've noticed a significant performance boost in my desktop. Installation was a breeze, and I haven't encountered any issues. For anyone looking to upgrade their memory for a faster and more efficient desktop experience, I highly recommend this RAM kit. It's a fantastic choice that won't disappoint!",

Fast and huge, managed to boot first try with an AM5 setup using xmp and same for Intel gen14. Looks mad professional/minimal too.Only downside is no config seems to make this fully stable at xmp speeds. It fails like 20% of memtests. Clocking it down to 6000 32 on the AM5 made it even faster and stable. Haven't yet found the best for Lga1700.",
