                "reviewText": "I searched and searched for seat covers, wanting to get something that was good quality. I'm glad I chose these. First of all, the look and feel very nice. Padding is great and makes the seat so much more comfortable. Installation probably took less than an hour easy. But you have to watch the video for instructions. They fit good and don't slip. One thing I will mention. My truck was sitting in the sun and the seats felt pretty warm. I had shorts on and thought I test the burn factor. They did not burn my legs, I was able to sit without getting burned . That was a plus for me.",

                "reviewText": "Material feels lovely to sit on and really helps pull the interior of the truck together. Feels much better to sit on, there's just something about leather seats in cars. Of course it get blistering in the summer and freezing in the winter, but that's to be expected. Was pretty easy to install too! After being in my truck for about 6 months, the securing hooks on the front seat covers stared to give out. Now here we are a few months later and one of the hooks that was sewn into the seat cover has completely ripped off. Maybe we are getting in and out of the truck incorrectly, but I would have expected longer life out of these seat covers. Material that you sit on is great, but maybe look into reinforcing the sewn line across the materials that anchor it to the seat?",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a seat cover set for my \u201819 RAM 1500 to help with dog hair and dirt cleanup vs my fabric seats. These covers came packaged well and on time. I will say skip the written instructions that come with it and watch the install video on Amazon. It goes over everything really well. Once I watched the video the seats took about 30 mins to install and with patience they fit really well. The front seats fit really good. The rear bench could fit a little better. There are some gaps where the seat buckles are and the design for the middle bench is just awkward. Be careful with the zippers as they are cheap and I snapped one but it has no impact on the performance.We\u2019ll see how these hold up but initially they look nice and fit well.",

Foam backing feels thick and dense and like it will last. The brown color chosen matches my interior well and gives a clean overall look. These will protect my original seats well while looking more expensive from a glance. I was considering Katskinz as well but for the cost difference I think I will be happy with these.",
