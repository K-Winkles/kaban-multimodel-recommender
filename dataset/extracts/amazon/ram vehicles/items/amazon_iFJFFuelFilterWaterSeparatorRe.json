The seller contacted me directly and offered to send a new filter without having to send the diesel covered one back. Like I said in the first review we have bought these a lot and they work great and are like half the price of buying in store. I own a hotshot business so we buy these like every to months.",

                "reviewText": "This is the second time I have bought these filters during my service intervals. First set went 15000 miles with NO issues at all. Ok the second set which I just installed caused me to be broke down on the side of the interstate 4 different times. After limping my truck back home and towing it to my nearest local shop they tested everything from fuel pressure to my check engine lights and ended up replacing my fuel pump on a 2014 ram 2500 with under 80k miles on it which I thought was odd for it to be bad already. So put a new pump on and still same issue. My truck would lose power and die. Long story short and over 800$ later the problem is with the Cartridge filter inside there is a plastic looking pin that actually is supposed to keep a check ball valve pushed down, well the pin inside is about 3/4 of an inch to short and that dodge made a great invention on this so you can\u2019t run your truck with out the filter. So I bought a oem filter at Napa and put it in and Wa LA!! It worked and it does not just die out. It\u2019s a very odd situation but I dont know if I got a bad batch or what but I\u2019m letting you know my experience and if anybody has something like this happen don\u2019t go to far in it and replace a fuel pump to find out that\u2019s not the issue. Hopefully someone will reach out to me for this review.",
