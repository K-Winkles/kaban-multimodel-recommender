Included image is of the old halogen on the passenger side and the new LED on the driver side. Installation on the passenger side was a pain (I'm not used to changing the lights myself), but it's got nothing to do with the LEDs themselves, had ti follow a YouTube video tutorial to access to the bulb. Once I had them both on, they worked amazingly. Took the car to a part of town with no streetlights after dark, and the difference between the old bulbs and the new was vast! Package comes with 4 bulbs, 2 for low beams and 2 for high beams (1 pair on each side). Make sure the models fit on your car, and then order them ASAP. You won't be disappointed.",

When the headlights are turned on, they flicker as well but not as bad or as often as the DRLs do. I bought two orders just in case the first order was defective but the second order had the same issue. I'd say it's worth the price if you don't mind that issue but I'd rather not deal with that since it can be distracting not only to you but to other drivers while driving.",
