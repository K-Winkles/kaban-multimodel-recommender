                "reviewText": "I was really glad to purchase this as an option. In many instances, the OEM parts cost an arm and a leg, AND you have to program them at a dealer (looking at you, trailer brakes). I will preface this by saying I\u2019m moderately skilled at mechanics and electronics, so I decided to take a crack at this.I had seen an install video where a guy spliced wires and I was fully prepared for that (which I hate doing). However I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box and everything was simple plug and play, no cutting wires. Install of the physical harnesses are straightforward and the instructions are well laid out. I tracked down a windows computer with Internet Explorer and got to work. Programmed the module with my key as per the instructions and successfully flashed the module without issues. Worked great!A few days later, I accidentally unplugged one of the harnesses trying to install something else. Plugged it back in thinking it would go back to normal. It didn\u2019t. I ended up having to email their tech support. They were prompt and thorough. I ended up resetting the module and starting over. Since then, I haven\u2019t had any issues and the product has worked wonderfully.However, I gave it four stars because i believe the software needs to be updated. Windows just announced its phasing out Internet Explorer, and at the time of this writing, IE was the only browser that was capable of programming the module. It took me a while to track down a computer that actually had it, and it was a bit of a hassle. Overall though, I\u2019m satisfied and I would recommend.",
