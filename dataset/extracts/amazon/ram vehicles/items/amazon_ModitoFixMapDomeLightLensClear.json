                "reviewText": "ModitoFix Map Dome Light Lens Clear Cover Interior Roof White Led Blubs kit for Dodge Ram -- I got this for my 2008 Dodge Ram 5500. The original lenses were slightly yellowed and bulbs were not bright enough. When I popped out the original lenses and bulbs (without any problems) I find that the old lenses look exactly like the new lenses. They were not yellowed after all. Dim light problem was with the bulbs alone. When I pressed the first new LED into the contacts, I heard and felt the plastic housing crack. Looked and decided to leave it until later because it will still work. Carefully installed the other bulb. First new lens that I tried to install, one of the lens pivots tabs broke off. Carefully applied some pressure on the other tabs with my finger to test them and another one broke off. I didn't even want to think about buying anther dome light/display housing so I set about figuring how to repair it. When I removed the housing I found it was a cheap thin brittle plastic. The tabs would not glue back on and hold. So with my Dremel, pliers, some plastic epoxy, and a wire coat hanger I designed and installed new axels for the lens pivot points. Coated all the cracks, broken points and probably going to break points with epoxy. The housing is now better than original and everything works including the brighter LEDs. The 5 minute job ended up taking about 3 hours work and two days of curing time. So the lesson here for you is these new lenses and LEDs will work and look great. However, think twice before trying to replace the dome lights in your cheap plastic Dodge housing.",

I wanted to brighten it up inside and see if I could get more lumens using LED bulbs. The two replacement lenses come with the bulbs which worked great - no LED ghosting.I did run into a problem, as some of the plastic is older, the switch that toggles the lights on/off had come loose from its housing. To be able to manually turn the lights on and off by pressing the lens, I had to use super glue to secure the switch back to a sturdy position. I spent about 30 minutes on that, otherwise this would have only taken 10 minutes to upgrade the bulbs and replace the new lenses.It\u2019s an upgrade worth doing though, it looks great!",
