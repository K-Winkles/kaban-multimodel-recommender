                "reviewText": "I get the whole concept you get what you pay for but I expected these to last more than 8 months before having problems. Installed these when I had to rplace the assemblies due to water leakage. I paud morew thatn the current asking price for the set. I was instantly impressed with the added brightness the way these were built. Then about 6 months in I started having issue with the left side intermittenly not working. I thouhgt it was the wiring harness from the vehicle to the assembly. Not wanting to tgake on that monster I was able to get it to work for about 2 more months. Finally took it to a mechanic who actually found the problem was the assembly itself. So here I am having to replace it to the tune of $700 with an OEM part and labor. Well now here I am at month 11 and the right side is now failed as well. Same issue. I took out the assembly looked at the harness on the assembly and it is the exact same issue as the left side. At least this time I will only have to pay for the part to fix it but will be out another couple hundrted dollars. According to the mechanic this is a common issue with these after market assemblies. (and no i didn't take it to a Dodge or Ram Dealer). Do not reccomend this product.",
