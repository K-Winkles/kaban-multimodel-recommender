From this point on, here's the new agenda\u2026. if it works as advertised, is well made, meets or exceeds the description, is a value, and arrives in a fair amount of time, it will get a \"star rating\" equal to what my expectations were/are. If it doesn't meet these criteria, then I will most definitely and descriptively tell the short comings of the products and you as a consumer will not have to go through the trouble of buying the product without some background knowledge. If the sell pulls that item and relists under another description, I will put the exact same review on the seller's feedback page. Sellers have done this a couple of times in the past, and I was true to my word then as well as now. DR",

Mine had 8GB of RAM and was a little slow now with some of the newer software so I wanted to try some of this RAM for a budget upgrade. WOW did I make a great choice! This is a fantastic speed upgrade going from 8GB to 32GB for about $40 I got a very noticeable increase in speed and performance while still running Windows 10 Pro.
