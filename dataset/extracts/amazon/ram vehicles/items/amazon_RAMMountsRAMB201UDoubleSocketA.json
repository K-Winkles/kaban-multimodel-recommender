                "reviewText": "As I have purchased several components which are used together, I am reviewing them as a group and repeating the review across all. My time with the product is still very short, I can only provide my initial impressions. RAM products are ASTOUNDING! They do tend to be a bit on the higher end of the spectrum for this type of product; however, the old adage \"you get what you pay for\" definitely holds in this case. The things I love about this group of products:1 - Once the devices are in place and tightened down, they are stable. There is minimal vibration; and, it does not swivel around when putting the phone in the cradle.2 - The X configuration of the cradle grip allows for maximum air flow around the phone. My previous phone suffered overheating damage from being in a cradle in the sun for an extended trip. The RAM components not only allow for more air flow but the long arm brings the unit further into the car, just past the rear-view mirror, minimizing the amount of direct sun exposure during the hottest times of the day.3 - This is the EASIEST cradle I have owned for getting the phone in and out. I have the LG G3 currently.I currently own two sets of this product. One for each vehicle. The LG G3 with a case is a bit of a tight fit in the phone grip cradle. It is not horrible; but, I have to put it in on an angle then straighten it. I have purchased the larger grip version for the second. It is much easier to get the phone in and out. I have not yet seen a down side to the larger vs normal. I will keep you posted......",
