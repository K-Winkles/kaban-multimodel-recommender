                "reviewText": "I got the 64gb kit at 3200, overall it's really nice. Dual rank, really nice blending with the RGB colors, slightly larger in physical size than the RAM i replaced. Had to go into BIOS and enable XMP2 to get the full 3200, but that's normal, just thought i'd mention it for those who just slap the RAM in and call it good. Largely that's all you gotta do. Helped out with games, i ran BeamNG on max settings and watched the machine start using up the memory. It ran great for hours. For Adobe Premier, this opened up my machine for both bigger projects without proxies, and higher resolution editing. nice and smooth now, less frustrating, and noticeably fewer crashes in premier if you can believe that. Fusion 360 also runs a lot better. Eventually i'll build a new rig using a new MOBO with DDR5, new GPU, maybe even a new case because why not, but i wanted to get a couple more years out of my current machine and this fit the bill.",

We have experienced no lag when gaming and you can have multiple screens open at one time without problem. The price point was good. Installation was basically plug and play. They are not unduly fragile. As a side note, we have a clear side to our desktop's tower and you can watch the modules light up and change color. VERY cool.",

If you're a streamer or just a gamer who likes playing games that take up alot of ram, I always recommend to get two 32 rams. People say it's a lot more than needed but personally, it's better to have it. They're really pretty and they work great. They don't get hot, they run amazing, it's everything it says it is.",

The RGB lighting is gorgeous and syncs well with my motherboard. The performance is also top-notch, with fast speeds and low latency. The installation was easy, and the packaging was nice.The only minor issue I have is that the RAM sticks are quite tall and they barely fit under my CPU cooler. I had to adjust the fan position a bit to make some room. It's not a big deal, but it would have been nice if they were a bit shorter or had a low-profile option.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this RAM to anyone looking for a reliable and stylish upgrade. I give it 4/5 stars.",
