                "reviewText": "I need an extension to my Ram mounts that attaches to the upper part of the front windshield so I can mount my Yaesu FTM-500 DR mobile ham unit. It needs to be at least 4 inches to clean the rear view mirror. It just holding the head unit of the mobile ham radio so this will work perfectly.This arm is what appears to be made from cast aluminum. The bolt and hardware is stainless steel and there is a pretty strong spring on one side to hold onto the 1\" inch ball so you don't drop everything when you loosen the knob to adjust or remove the mount. The one thing I really like about this arm is that on the inside where the ball goes in. There's a webbing that cast into the all of the cups. This is to help grip the ball to prevent any movement. I have several of the ram mount and they all eventually shake themself loose or move from the rigors of off road.Overall, this is a great extension and I honestly think it's way better than the Ram brand. Kudos to a great product that is well made.",

The shorter arm was made of plastic. This one is made of metal. When I unboxed the arm the weight caught me a bit off-guard as I was expecting something lighter. Then I realized it was made of metal; talk about a pleasant surprise! I took the mount apart, put in the new arm, and was very happy! The new arm raised the tablet enough to allow me to read the gauges behind it. The only drawback is due to the added mass; the mount/tablet bounce around a bit more than before, which is a bit concerning, and just slightly more annoying while trying to read the speed information.PROs: longer, made of metal, sturdierCONs: heavier/more mass",

So, when I opened the box, there was one spring that was canted to the side and barely kept the arm level. Maybe it's missing a spring. So, what I did, I removed the spring from its place, and I slipped it over the bolt and locked it down. Once I did that, then it works like a charm. It clamps on any 1\" ball system from brand names to other types. So, this is versatile as long as you match it up with its kind. The materials used are really solid with aluminum and stainless steel. It's well worth the price but again, I'm still wondering if there's supposed to be two springs or one spring.",

                "reviewText": "Running a Helix 7 mega SI G4 along with a cheap Galaxy Tab Active 2 Tablet for maps, and needed to raise the FF. This longer arm gave the perfect length needed. Very stable and sturdy to handle crashing waves, Can now fully use the entire small Helix 7 screen just for underwater viewing, and move navigation maps to a more correct larger vertical view. Using tablet app instead of a FF card, at a MUCH lower annual cost with constant and immediate updates.",

I highly recommend it and wouldn\u2019t hesitate purchasing another. This has some knurling? on the ball end for some interference to avoid slipping which i appreciated. Overall great arm.",
