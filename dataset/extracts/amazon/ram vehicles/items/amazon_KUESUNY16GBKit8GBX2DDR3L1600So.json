                "reviewText": "I bought this Kuesuny 16GB RAM kit (two 8GB cards of RAM) to replace two 4GB RAM cards (a total of 8GB) that had originally come in my PC (which is now almost 7 years old.) The performance of my PC had slowed down considerable and had become very buggy, and I started getting frequent \"blue screen of death\" messages followed by forced re-starts of the machine. I ran a memory test and discovered that my PC's old RAM had malfunctioned and needed to be replaced. (Which explained the problems I was having!)It was easy to install the new RAM. I just popped the cover off of my PC, pulled out the two old RAM memory cards, and pushed the two new RAM cards into the same slots that the old ones came out of, and then put the cover back on the PC. (I dusted out the inside of the machine really good while I was in there also.)I then plugged my PC in and turned it on, and it booted up faster than ever before, at an incredibly blazing-fast speed (my system's main drive is a 500GB Crucial SSD, which also helps with this speed.) My old PC (running Windows 10) now works better than it ever did. It operates faster than ever before, and I can open LOTS of tabs in my browser quickly, with no problems, and I can also have multiple programs/apps open at the same time (including those that require a lot of memory.)So, I am extremely pleased with this purchase so far. And, the price was good also--a great value! If the new Kuesuny RAM prove to be reliable and hold up well over time, I'll likely buy more of their products like this in the future. (I have another older machine that I am also thinking of making a similar upgrade to, since I am so please with this one.)The original RAM that was in my PC was made by a major manufacturer that has a reputation of being one of the best brands (and its prices are usually higher than most other brands.) BUT, I really like the new Kuesuny RAM even better, assuming that it proves to be durable and reliable and has relatively long life. I recommend it.",

From this point on, here's the new agenda\u2026. if it works as advertised, is well made, meets or exceeds the description, is a value, and arrives in a fair amount of time, it will get a \"star rating\" equal to what my expectations were/are. If it doesn't meet these criteria, then I will most definitely and descriptively tell the short comings of the products and you as a consumer will not have to go through the trouble of buying the product without some background knowledge. If the sell pulls that item and relists under another description, I will put the exact same review on the seller's feedback page. Sellers have done this a couple of times in the past, and I was true to my word then as well as now. DR",

                "reviewText": "The quick review is simple. Easy to order, arrived quickly and nicely packaged. Would be nice if it was in a anti-static bag, but I\u2019m sure any other brand might ship the same. Cost was reasonable considering this is dated RAM orders for an older laptop. Not sure about customer support. Windows booted with no issues and recognized the memory.The long story: The jury is still out. I updated an older 2011 HP laptop Intel I-7 2nd gen chip after replacing the HDD with an SSD to stretch out the life of the device as it\u2019s really just for home use. Over the last couple days I\u2019ve been getting a blue screen error with the message \u201cmemory stop\u201d. It happened a couple times in the same day.I was pretty sure I installed properly, but for arguments sake, I swapped the ram slots and made sure they were properly seated into the slots. Restarted and it seems fine. I\u2019ll keep an eye on it and update the review after I\u2019m sure that one or both of the dimm\u2019s aren\u2019t bad.Of course, I\u2019m aware few companies manufacture memory, but there are so many different unknown brand names and I honestly have no idea, like many 3rd party reseller products lately on Amazon, what is new, remanufactured or used. Their splash pages for product promotion say a lot of nice things, but I tend to return many items that don\u2019t live up to the quality. I wish Amazon would crack down on imports making sure they at least meet the certifications or standards such as UL, but I guess that\u2019s why this stuff is cheap. Anyway, I\u2019ll update in a couple months if it runs stable. Planning to update the batteries and clean and add new heat grease to hopefully extend its life. Thanks for reading and hope this helps.Update: added a star. Since reseating the memory, I\u2019ve had no issues. Continues to be recognized as 16 GB of installed ram. Has helped deliver performance when it pushing a lot of content. So far so good.",
