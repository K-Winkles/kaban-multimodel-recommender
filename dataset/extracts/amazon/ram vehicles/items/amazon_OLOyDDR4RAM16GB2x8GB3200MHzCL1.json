                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded my gaming rig with the OLOy DDR4 RAM, and let me tell you, it's been nothing short of a \"saving the world\" experience in the gaming universe!First off, installation was smoother than a stealthy assassin's move in a stealth game. It slipped right into my motherboard like it was meant to be there, and before I knew it, my gaming computer had transformed into the ultimate superhero.This RAM is like the caffeine for your computer. At 3000 MHz, it's faster than a ninja on espresso. Games load faster, graphics render smoother, and the whole experience is so snappy that I felt like I could save the world in the blink of an eye (or the click of a mouse).Now, I'm not saying the OLOy RAM gives you superhuman powers, but it certainly feels that way. With 16GB of memory, multitasking is a breeze. I can game, stream, chat, and still have enough RAM left to run a small space station (if I wanted to, you know, take over the universe from my gaming chair).The best part is, this RAM runs at 1.35V, which means it's more energy-efficient than some of the light bulbs in my house. So, not only did it save the gaming world, but it's also saving the planet, one frag at a time.In conclusion, OLOy DDR4 RAM has been a real game-changer in my gaming setup. It's like adding a jetpack to your gaming computer \u2013 faster, more powerful, and it might just make you feel invincible in the gaming world. So, if you're looking to upgrade your rig and save the gaming universe, I highly recommend OLOy DDR4 RAM. It's the hero your computer deserves!",

                "reviewText": "Like most, I was a bit skeptical when ordering these kits because of their low price. I used 2 sets of the 64gb 3200MT/s for two different builds.First things first, if you don't know what XMP is, you probably have no business installing RAM sticks in the first place. XMP worked absolutely perfectly in both setups. Fully stable at 16-20-20-40. A bit loose, but plenty quick for a 64gb kit out of the box.Secondly, for anyone wondering, the chips in these kits (at least both sets I received) are Micron B die. Thaiphoon Burner couldn't read the info, so it left me to dig up some details. What I came to find out is these kits use the Micron MT40A2G8NRE-083E:B which makes them a Micron B die. It's not a Samsung B die, but they still seem to like overclocking.I was able to achieve 3800MT/s (1900mhz on MEM and FCLK) at 1.4v with 18-21-21-40. Memtest stable with a bandwidth of 49GB/s and 85ns . Pretty insane for a sub $250 64gb kit!Ended up settling in at 3600MT/s (1800mhz on MEM and FCLK) 1.38v 16-20-20-38 for that golden Ryzen 3600/CL16 sweet spot. Closed in at 47.5GB/s and 76ns. With a low enough voltage to ensure longevity.All in all, if you're on the fence about this kit (at least the 64gb version) just get it. The fact that you can hit 3800MT/s stable on a $240 kit is absolutely mind blowing. Not to mention the white looks extra snazzy. I can't speak to the quality of the other kits, but I am extremely happy with the ones I received.My other components for referenceMobo: Asus Prime x570 ProCpu: Ryzen 9 3900XTGpu: RTX 2080SSSD: 2 x PNY 1TB M.2 Gen4",

It is great for budget builds and ran all sorts of games no problem like cyberpunk, star citizen, COD, etc. One of the sticks just went bad in less than 10 months which was causing my pc to consistently crash and blue screen no matter what I was doing.All in all it is still a good product that's easy to install and runs a lot of high end games. I never tried to overclock it so I'm unsure how it would run.",

                "reviewText": "Working flawlessly. Run pretty hard for few month now. top-tier Quality memory without brand-name tax. As I suspected 64 wasn't really enough for me, so ordered 2 more sticks of 32gb. 3200Mhz is excellent speed.The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we don't understand computers.The negative comments about timing are ignorance to a long held common standard. this memory is on point. if your motherboard is on point in recognizing/setting is luck draw, as already endlessly noted, many will have to turn on XMP in bios because it wasn't already toggled on in their motherboard. that is just part of installing memory, you not swapping batteries. not the memory fault computers were designed for computer nerds. the memory is good, computers can be hard. For note, I have ASRock Z390 Phantom Gaming 4 motherboard bought at the end of 2019, but the leading memory standard so yea it will work in everything it should work in. Most things as this still the dominant hardware class.CPU/GPU's are evolving so the importance of ram speed is a shifting landscape. but most gamers would not be disappointed with this memory. yes, is faster speeds today but in bang for the buck with how fast hardware changes (or just trying get best system for the dollar), this good choice. in most setups 3200Mhz is still in the high end performance sweet zone, and there are a lot of advancements coming, I found this the perfect speed to tide me over until the next hardware revolution. wild times1/21 update: installed the 2nd set, so running 128gb ram now without issues. oddly XMP got turned off when adding 2nd set, so speed reverted to 2133, dunno why, but turned back on in bios and memory returned to 3200. Wanted enough ram that I wasn't using disk cache and this is what it took. need what you need i guess. certainly proven Bill Gates 'nobody ever need more 640k' wrong! lol! anyways, memory is solid, zero issues2/23 update: spoke too soon. system, not often, but on occasions has started to lock up. took me awhile to rule out some other things I changed. Is better to buy memory in sets or at the very least at or close to same time so better chance is less variance between the sticks. I wonder if that is problem I having here. The memory is good .. I've run memory test and no errors. Maybe I need a higher quality motherboard to better handle 128gb. But for now I will try tweaking the settings, maybe shuffle the sticks around (tech is silly sometime) .. will have research first, I think increasing(?) the voltage is one trick for stability, if doesn't work I'll try underclocking. see if that helps my system handle this much ram better. -- also considered problem could be my m2 overheating, isn't something that changed in my system, but ordering a heatsink for it anyways --2/28 - after changing clock speed to 3100 I've yet to experience another lockup running 128gb. could be imperfections in the memory but probably my lower end motherboard. I was considering upgrading my mobo, but if it stays stable then I'm happy.",
