                "reviewText": "Very happy with the swing box from the ease of installation to how it works. Installed a box on the passenger side of a 2016 Ram which required no measurements and took approx 10 minutes. Box worked perfectly without any need for adjustments. Box has quite a bit of storage space for both large and small items. The locks seem to be of good quality and the lock to prevent lifting the box off the supports was a nice touch. Don't need to worry about someone walking off with the box if left unattended.Only two small issues. The box has to be swung out in order to unlatch my bed cover. Once the cover is latched, the box fits fine with no issues for the box or cover. I'm not able to swing the box out from under the bed cover far enough to completely open the box due to the box hitting the cable support for the tailgate. Not sure that there is any way to avoid this problem and it's not a great hardship to lift the cover slightly when I need to get into the box.I think the box, hardware and supports are well made and worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "So far the product seems sturdy and able to hold lightweight items. The installation was super easy. Took about 40 minutes to unbox and completely install both the drivers and passengers side boxes. For my model truck I had to self tap / drill the mounting hardware into the bed which wasn't hard but isn't ideal if you don't plan on them staying in place forever. The icing on the cake for me was the fact that both boxes were keyed alike even though I purchased them 1 day apart. Huge attention to detail by the manufacturer / product shipping. The only downside I can see is they are plastic and my bed isn't covered yet so the summer sun might destroy them over time.",

                "reviewText": "This arrived very quick and in good condition. I installed it on mr 2015 Ram 1500 with no problems. It comes with self tapping screws/bolts that you canc screw directly into the side of the truck bed if you choose. I drilled some small starter holes that made it much easier to install. It took me all of 15 minutes to install it. Operationally it swings very smooth and easy. When closing it those sound made by the latching devices is a crisp lock noise and it locks to the bed securely. I used a padlock at the back when it's not going to be used to keep it from being swung ope. The lid has a lock get device and locks fairly well. It's not Fort Knox but it's functional.Pros.. Easy installation..operates very smooth..looks good when locked close..swings out to allow very easy access..fair amount of storage if you take your time putting things in..good upper and lower trays for smaller tools, bits, etc..Cons....top lock is functional but not a secure as it could be (I might engineer a better one)With all this being said I would highly recommend this to someone wanting a bit more storage with easy exterior access.Update: I have since placed a Access Vanish roll up cover on the bed of my truck. There was no issues with the storage box working correctly. I kind of like having the box hidden by the cover.",

                "reviewText": "These were extremely simple and easy to install on a 2014 Ram 1500. No way, shape, or form would i consider these to be completely secure. The locks on top are there to keep sticky fingers out but if someone has a pry bar, they can open the lid while it's locked since the 90\u00b0 metal bracket on the box itself isn't attached permanently, it does slide out. Mine did not come with the pivot locks so I can't say if that portion is secured well. It does have a spot to place your own lock on the bracket and does require removal of lock if you want to swing the box out. Overall, they will do what I want them to do, keep/hold tools, straps, cables, etc from sliding around in the bed and away from the elements.",
