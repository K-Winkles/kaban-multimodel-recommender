                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Alienware Aurora R9 (Not XMP RAM)",
                "reviewText": "What I purchased: Crucial RAM 64GB Kit (4x16GB) DDR4 3200MHz CL22What it's for: Alienware Aurora R9 (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700K CPU @ 3.60GHz 3.60 GHz), 16GB RAM defaultFirst off, the RAMs were easy to install, you just pop open the R9 case and swap out the existing 2 sticks for these 4, close the case and you're good to go, no configurations necessary. Once you boot up you should receive a notification that your memory has changed, just hit continue and the RAMs work perfectly. These RAMs are highly compatible with the Alienware Aurora R9!Now for the downside, these RAMs are not XMP therefore my R9 could only utilize them at 2666mhz clock speed and not the full 3200mhz these sticks were rated for. The R9 requires that the RAM you use be XMP in order to reach speeds of 3200mhz. So if you wanted 3200mhz you'd have to ensure that you buy XMP RAM and not these. There are some systems that could utilize the full 3200mhz but Alienware R9 is not one of those, which is why it's capped at 2666mhz.I play World of Warcraft on this and run Chrome with multiple tabs open, discord, music, multiple other chat apps, etc and my PC is now utilizing around 23GB out of the 64GB. So maybe in hindsight I should have stuck to 32GB and not 64GB which is overkill. If you're a gamer like me that like to multi task then 32GB should be more than adequate... It's kinda like ordering food at a restaurant, never be the person that orders food when you're starving. You will over order.... stick with 32GB first... chances are you won't even hit 28GB of usage.. extra RAM beyond your utilization rate doesn't help.",

                "reviewText": "I was helping a friend finish setting up his new computer when my system became jealous of the amount of RAM in his new PC. As we got to talking about the prices he paid for his parts, he mentioned what his RAM cost and I was stunned that the price was so low. That is when he mentioned that one of the reasons he decided to build a new system was that the cost of components had dropped considerably over the past number of months. So I decided to check the price of memory here on Amazon to discover that the price had dropped an insane amount since last year, in fact it had dropped so much that it would be foolish not to upgrade. So I ordered an extra 32 GB.When it arrived, it took me just a few minutes to open my system and install the memory. As my system was already disconnected due to setting up a new computer desk, everything was quick and easy. As I already had Crucial memory in my system, it was recognized immediately and gave my system a boost that it needed. While my system was working fine, with today's memory hungry applications you can never go wrong with adding some extra RAM. Going from 16 GB, which I consider the minimum to run Windows 11, to 48 GB has made an obvious difference in system response. It is well worth the minimal price for the boost in performance. And you will never go wrong with Crucial memory products. I worked in IT since long before PCs came on the scene and have been using Crucial memory for as long as I can remember and have never had any problems with them and recommend them highly. And no, I was not paid to say that, I am just stating the simple fact of the matter.",
