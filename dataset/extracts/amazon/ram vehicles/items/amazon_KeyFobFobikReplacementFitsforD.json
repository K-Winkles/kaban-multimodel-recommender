                "reviewText": "I purchased these September of 2023. Had them programed and the keys cut at a Dodge dealership which costed another $100.00. Supposedly they had new batteries when purchased. Well on 11/12/2023 my truck showed low key fob battery. So I bought new batteries (CR2032) 3.0 Volt battery. I installed the battery, and went to the truck to make sure it was working and it will not work at all. Took it back apart and checked battery voltage and it had 3.01 volts. If I order a new key fob I will have to pay another $90.00 to get it programed. I would like a replacement. Will update after I find out what happens next.",
