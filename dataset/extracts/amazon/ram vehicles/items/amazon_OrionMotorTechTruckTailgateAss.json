                "reviewText": "I bought two of these for my 2018 Ram 1500. Installation was fairly simple but both cables that support the tailgate were damaged putting on the plastic cylindrical protectors. The cable casing peeled off exposing the metal cable. Not that big of a deal but I was disappointed. Once installed, the tailgate is very slow to go down which didn't seem like much of a problem but if you put the slightest pressure to make it go down any quicker, the tailgate comes unhinged on the right side leaving you to have to line up the hinge on the tailgate to the tailgate post on the bed of the truck to properly seat it. The same happens when lifting the tailgate to close it and it also makes it a heavier push to close. I actually damaged the hinge when i didn't notice that the tailgate wasn't lined up correctly when closing and a piece of metal broke in the hinge. Still functional thankfully. My wife refuses to get anything from the bed off the truck now.I gave the product a week of use, but I'll be removing it and returning them.",

                "reviewText": "The product was fairly straight forward to install with exception of the bolt that mushrooms inside the tailgate to hold the pneumatic arm in place. The directions could explain the process better; although I figured it out, it took a few attempts. The assist does effectively slow the drop of the tailgate as well as lightens the lift to close the tailgate.Yes I would recommend and purchase again.",
