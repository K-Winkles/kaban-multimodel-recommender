                "reviewText": "This product said it was designed for my truck, but it doesn't fit quite right. The circle at the top located by the windshield is off just a bit, so it blocks my sensor causing my headlights to be on at all times, rather than when overcast or dark, which not a huge deal, kinda like getting daytime running lights, so okay with that, but there is a bump/hump in the center up by the windshield that will not lay down, and a section right below that that I have to cut out because its covering one of my vents on top of my dashboards. I don't know if its supposed to adhere to my dash but it doesn't. maybe because of the lump at the top center, but doesn't adhere. It doesn't really move around either though, just wouldn't call it adhered. It is a nice dark color so it does reduce the glare off my dash, making it easier for me to see. Overall pretty happy with it after cut out complete and attached some velcro pieces underneath and to dash to remove the lump and make it lay more properly.",

                "reviewText": "The bad: The fit is ridiculous. There is not excuse for having 1 to 2 inch gaps on the sides. The placement of the speaker cutouts is off by over an inch, and there is not prevision for the center channel speaker that comes with the Alpine or surround sound systems. Despite what the description states, that material blocks practically all sound from the speakers. The mat does not remotely conform to the contours of the dash, and has lumps, bumps, and folds all over it. The holes cutout for the defroster vents do not line up, and block some of the defroster air, leaving the windshield with frost in the lower parts. I will be returning this mat for these reasons.The good: The material is nice, and the pad does not slide around. The black suede does kill the dash glare that reflects on the windshield. This part is extremely effective, and was the main reason I wanted a pad to begin with. Also, the stitching is pretty good for a $40 mat. If you just want to knock off the glare, this product will to that job just fine.",
