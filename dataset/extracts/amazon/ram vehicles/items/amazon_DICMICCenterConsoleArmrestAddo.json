                "reviewText": "Installed on my 05 Ram 1500 SLT with center seat. It fits like a glove, but does make closing and opening the center console difficult. I don't have adjustments for my center lid like others do. I just had to muscle it down and with about 40% of my strength usage, it latched. I put 3 strips of 3m double sided tape (left, middle, and right) where it contacts the inside of the existing console tray. It has much deeper cup holders than I was expecting and compared to the OEM that fold down, these will hold containers much better. All in all, got what I wanted and it fits as expected. Can't ask for much more.",
