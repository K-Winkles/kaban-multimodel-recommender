                "reviewText": "I installed the 64GB DDR5 4800MT/s CL40 kit into a 2023 Asus Flow X16 (RTX 4060 model GV601VV-X16.I94060) about a month ago. No problems. RAM performs as expected and matches specs used by the stock RAM Asus installs. Going from the factory 16GB up to this 2x32GB kit has not had a significant effect on gaming. However, it has dramatically improved creative applications -- particularly Blender 3D.If you install this into a Flow X16 2023 like I did, don't panic when the laptop appears to fail to boot after the upgrade. Leave it alone for 5-10 minutes -- it's doing some sort of memory testing or timing or something. If you've still got a black screen on boot after 15 minutes, then hold the power button and force it to power cycle. It should start up normally the next time. This delay is unnerving but normal and not a fault of the RAM.",
