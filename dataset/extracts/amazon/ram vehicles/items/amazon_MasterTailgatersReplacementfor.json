                "reviewText": "Master Tailgaters Dodge Ram 2009-2015 Black Tailgate Backup Reverse Handle with Camera Excellent backup camera for my 2015 Ram 1500. I paired it up with Pioneer AVH-4100 NEX. I bought TWO of these just in case I needed it. Though, I initially tapped the rear backup wiring as the direction suggests it, it did not work. I had NO error on my part (wiring). I don't know if RAM changed anything for 2015+ model or no, but the video would NOT turn on. Time for plan B: Ran the power wire from headunit. Bought a spool of cheap 20 awg wire from amazon and works flawless! Good resolution. Good night time image quality (thanks to super bright rear backup lights by RAM ;) ) . Overall very happy and please buy this. Super easy. See my attached pictures. Ask a question or two if you have. I'll gladly answer.",

I did have to buy some 18 gauge wire to run to front of my truck. The connection I was making into the factory head unit (5.0/RA2) because the wires supplied were not long enough. The RCA for the video was exactly the right length to run from the tailgate to the radio connections. I also added a larger wire loom to encase the RCA, power and ground wires into for an easier install. Honestly the hardest part was running the wire loom and cable tie-ing it under the truck and tucking it out of the way. I was able to come up through the emergency brake grommet (with a little widening of the hole) into the cab and not have to go through the firewall. The display has a pretty good \"fisheye\" effect but for backing up and not hitting something, it works perfect!",

                "reviewText": "Plastic quality seems to be ok, not as heavy duty as the OEM and there are a few sharp corners that may need attention. Fit is good and easy to install and easy to move your existing tailgate lock over to. The camera come with about 12\" worth of cable that plugs into the longer cable that feeds the RCA plug to the stereo, and allows for 12 v and ground. The 12v is fuse protected. The odd thing is it comes with a pigtail for the 12v and ground, but this doesn't fit anything nor is there an adapter for this included in the wiring. I simply cut it to length and terminated it myself. One important thing is that aftermarket stereos that have backup camera capability require a trigger to activate automatically when you put it in reverse. The trigger wire is not included, that would have been a great addition. The quality of the camera image is very good. There are no default backup lane lines built into the camera hardware, so whether or not they show up is based on each aftermarket radio.",

                "reviewText": "Works great and fits exactly like factory tailgate handle. Cables seem to have good insulation and a quality loom. The video cable has plenty of length to reach the stereo head unit and the positive and negative power cables are about 4 to 5 feet long. The power cable length is not a problem if you are going to tap into a power source at the rear of the truck, like at the reverse lights. However, I wanted constant power only when the truck was on (not just when truck is in reverse) so I extended the power cables into the cab to be able to tap into power and the keyed power 12v outlet (I used a plug and play adapter from infotainment). It's only been a couple of days but so far it works GREAT and I am very happy with the value when compared the cost of a factory one.",

                "reviewText": "I installed this on a 2012 ram 1500 while upgrading to a pioneer head unit. The product feels sturdy and they give you plenty of cable length to easily route with working slack. Overall picture quality is good and it works well in a low light parking garage.TWO NEGATIVES (just be aware of these. they may not be an issue for you).1. No parking assist lines.This was not highlighted anywhere in the product info and many of the customer pictures show lines. Some head units can add these to all cameras, but my Pioneer AVH391BHT cannot so I do not have them. Other similar product offer an on off switch for the lines, but this does not. It is confirmed by the seller in one of the Q and A questions. I would have chosen a different option if I had known this, but after doing all of the install work I don't want to return this and start again.2. Not as solid as the OEM handle.They specifically say in their description that they match the OEM quality, but it feels cheaper. Like lighter plastics. I don't think it will fail, but just not as high quality as they describe.INSTALL NOTESFor anyone who cares, I've seen a lot of questions on line on how to run the video cable into the cab so I'll tell you how I did it in a fairly easy way that does not require you to pull up the carpeting. Luckily this company gives you plenty to length in the video cable (at least for my crew cab standard bed). I drilled a hole in the rubber boot in the fire wall where the main wire harness enters the cab. It is a fairly easy rout to go from the back of the deck down behind your pedals and up to that boot entry point. After pushing through you can drop stright to the ground then pass long the frame where the other wires are, giving you plenty of easy zip tie points to avoid drag in the wire.",

                "reviewText": "Update 04/06/2022: No issues so far, still works like it did upon install.It's only been a few days since I've installed this, so far it looks and works great with the PAC Audio kit. The quality is near identical to the OEM handle. The camera image is good, hard to judge on a small display screen. The installation was simple however the power and ground wires are much shorter than the video cable. I did not want to tap the tail lights or any other system; Instead I ran them directly to the PAC Audio harness by extending the power wires using 16/18 gauge electrical wire (commonly used for thermostats).A draw back is the location of the fuse which in my case on my truck, falls above the axle in a location that is not easily accessed by hand. I could have routed it differently but wanted to follow the same path as the the rest of the wiring from the tailgate. A quick disconnect would also be a good idea to locate between the tailgate and body.This along with the aftermarket PAC Audio harness saved me about $500 had I went to the dealership to install a similar item and the only real difference is I don't get the dynamic guide lines. Nbd. Plus the harness also allows multiple cameras to be added.",
