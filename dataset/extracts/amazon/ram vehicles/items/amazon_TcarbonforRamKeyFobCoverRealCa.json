Covers the the entire fob well. Leaves the buttons completely exposed. Protects your fob very well from all those other items one may carry in their pockets with your fob.The aesthetics of the fob cover are absolutely a work of art. This is a great looking fob cover. This cover is a definite conversation starter and is one that your friends will be asking you about when they see it. The feel and texture of the fob are absolute perfection. Very smooth and high quality.Only complaints about this fob cover is that is does shorten the distance in which you fob is effective. Also the D ring that comes with this fob to attach the lanyard is oversized and is not something you wish to carry in your pockets, if that is where you carry your fob. However, the fob snaps closed quite tight and you do not need this D ring and lanyard for the fob to work and protect your fob.If you are looking for a solid high quality fob cover this is definitely one to purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This T-Carbon Key Fob Cover Looks Really cool. The new key fobs are pretty hefty, but don't worry about adding to it, as this cover is made of 95% thin glass fiber. It just snaps tightly together over the fob. When you need to remove it to change the battery, it has a small indentation to easily separate the two halves. It comes in a good looking box, lined with soft material and padding for protection. It would make a great gift for anybody that owns a newer Ram Truck, for any special occasion. The key chain is a sweet added design and looks great, but for me it just gets in the way. I really like the polished look to it and the way it makes the carbon fiber shine. Life is Good!! This T-Carbon Fob Cover Rates Really High on the Claydog Approval Scale!! Enough Said, Wrench Drop!! Thanks for your time, Claydog",
