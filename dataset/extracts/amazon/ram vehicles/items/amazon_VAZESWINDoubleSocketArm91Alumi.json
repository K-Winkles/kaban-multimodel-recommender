That is a good thing because such a long arm needs to be solid in order to hold items and not flex.If you are tired of paying RAM prices for these accessories, then look at this brand. It is made of solid metal and I can see this lasting a very long time. Functionally I would see no differences between this and the same RAM brand part.Really not much else to be said when a simple item like this is constructed well, does what it is supposed to and comes at a good price (comparatively).",
