                "reviewText": "NOTE: I already upgraded my CPU from the stock i3 to an i5 processor*, so my computer is now about as upgraded as it can be. Upgrading a CPU is possible with this model laptop as the CPU isn't soldered to the Mother Board. The reason I upped the ram is I was running out of ram regularly with heavy video editing projects (originally had 8GB of ram).I use Ubuntu Linux (16.04 64bit) and do not know how this ram would function on this computer if it were running Windows as I do not use Windows (and very happy that I don't)... although, I would guess that this ram would work fine.This is a very easy upgrade for most laptops... just check your specific model on the Crucial website to be sure you are ordering the correct ram modules for your specific model computer to avoid the hassle of getting incompatible ram modules ;)So far I have had no problems with these ram units, and everything worked perfectly when I booted up after installing them! I am using them in a Toshiba Satellite c855-s5355 Laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 and my System Monitor shows 15.6 GB of usable RAM out of the 16 GB installed (8GBx2)... I am a happy camper!*fyi... I installed the Intel Core i5-2410M CPU @ 2.30GHz (2 cores/4 threads) which worked perfectly in my computer. However, I do not know if Windows 8 or 10 would have hiccuped with this upgrade... again, I use Linux, so it just worked in my case :)",

                "reviewText": "Today I upgraded my 2015 HP Pavilion model 13-a012cl \"X360\" laptop computer using the Crucial 8GB Single DDR3/DDR3L 1866 MT/s (PC3-14900) Unbuffered SODIMM 204-Pin memory chip. 8GB is the max my laptop can support. The upgrade was flawless. The difference between DDR3 and DDR4 is the number of pins on the chip that connect it to the socket. DDR3 has 240, and DDR4 has 288. Besides the pin number, DDR3 and DDR4 look physically different in length and width. Google your computer's model number or contact the manufacturer to determine which your specific model requires.My laptop is about 5 years old, and usually I have it tethered to an external 22\" LG LCD monitor, so the unit functions more like a desktop box would. I thought about getting a new laptop, but opted to purchase the Cruicial RAM chip -$44, a Cruicial MX 500 1 TB 2.5\" solid state drive (SSD) (CT 1000MX500SSSD1) - $120, and a new fan- $17. I also bought a Unitek USB to SATA USB-3 adapter to clone drives - $19. So for around $200, I have essentially a new computer.Numerous publications over the years have cited adding additional RAM memory as the single best - easiest - improvement one can make in improving computer perfomance. Add to that SSD and a new cooling fan, and I ought to be golden for another five years. I don't do payroll for the State of California, nor do I track license plate numbers for Bejing, so to me, this was a cost-efficient upgrade.Thanks Cruicial and Adorama for the sales and support!",

                "reviewText": "Gotta say I didn't think I would have the best luck because all YT reviews showed same manufacture Ram purchased for second slot. This was cheaper alternative and man oh man this card (8gb) snapped right into place. I ended up switching the old 2gb Ram card from first slot into the secondary slot instead. All together I went from 2gb to 10gb (really 9.66gb) Ram and noticed the change instantly. Before I couldn't run YT with other tabs open like Playbooks (no video) without the freezing and asking me to close session after 10min. But when I put in the new card I instantly opened 20 tabs and ran YT with no problem. Even tried Netflix and two tabs with YT(YouTube) in the background paused while watching in another tab and it ran flawless.. In order to see the changes I downloaded the Cog extension from the website because there isn't no way to see Ram in settings on the device. All in all get this card if you have a First gen Chromebox and make sure it is the CT10246BF186D for correct model number for installation. Some will say you don't need this much RAM but who are we kidding with Chrome using so much CPu and Ram to run programs. I am thinking of getting another 8gb to increase to 16gb but we will see",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased from both amazon and crucial in the past and can say that I have always been pleased with both companies and their products.I recently purchased a late 2015 27\" iMac with the base 8GB from Apple as I wanted to avoid the Apple Tax and perform the upgrade myself. I also ordered a set of these from Amazon. After reading the reviews, I was sure these would be the correct memory modules. To my surprise, the DID NOT run at the full 1866Mhz but rather at 1600Mhz (See photos). I called Crucial and they confirmed that although the specs are identical, these are non mac specific memory modules. He also stated that they may have worked for other users but would not recommend them.I recalled seeing a very similar product - [ASIN:B0181JTF66 Crucial 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR3L 1866 MT/s (PC3-14900) SODIMM 204-Pin Memory For Mac - CT2K8G3S186DM] - and referenced it to the Crucial Support Rep. He then confirmed that these are the ones that are certified to be compatible with Macs. The specs are identical but these are made specifically for Macs.Save yourselves the trouble and frustration and get the CT2K8G3S186DM modules instead as they will operate at the full 1866Mhz speed.I am only taking out 1 star as I feel that this should be specified in the description but I have no issues with Amazon or Crucial's products or services.",
