I'll have to go ahead and get the blank emergency key that came with the new fob cover cut to match. Was hoping that step would be unnecessary. Other than that, swapping out the chip board from the original fob went smoothly after finding a video online of someone doing it, because no instructions come with the fob cover. You'll need a T6 Torx screwdriver to remove the 4 obvious screws and the 2 additional hidden screws. I used a flathead screwdriver to pry the cover apart at the open end. After removing the 4 obvious screws, you can then pull off the sides by hand and then use 5 toothpicks to pry the two main pieces apart (2 on the left side, 2 on the right side and 1 on the closed end) where the latches are. Find the video and it will be super easy.",
