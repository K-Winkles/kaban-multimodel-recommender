After a little research, I found that the 3rd brake light, which is in the center top of the cab is a common leak point. I removed the light and found that the gasket was completely rotten. I changed it and the leaks stopped. If your Dodge Ram has water leaks, this is a quick, easy, inexpensive thing to change before paying a shop hundreds of dollars for a leak test.This gasket worked perfectly and was easy to install. It was also inexpensive.Do make sure and clean all the old gasket material off. There will be a lot of residue if yours is as rotten as mine was.",

The cab air pressure relief vents were leaking pretty bad, so I replaced those. Still leaking. Then I used this to fix the brake light leak. This fit well and stopped that leak. I still have another leak. There is apparently a leak on the actual rear window itself and I\u2019ll have to get the glass removed and resealed. Hope this helps someone track down their leaks.",

                "reviewText": "Have the notorious leaking 3rd brake light (much worse now) and came across this brand via a YouTube video.In the video, the gasket looked a lot thicker than what I received and the reviewer had nothing but praise for it, so I used the link in his description which brought me here to make the purchase.Took the third brake light out and brought it in the house to compare the old to this new one. Believe it or not, my factory gasket was slightly thicker\u2026Anyway, I removed the old gasket using 3M\u2019s adhesive remover, then washed with soap and water. It was clean down to the plastic.Installed the gasket on the brake light and went outside to install.After install I looked around the brake light and noticed the middle sections (both top and bottom) where not compressed like the sides. (I understand fastener location)It bothered me enough to try different screw tightnesses and the little adjustments I could make.Same outcome. Went in the house and filled a standard pint glass full of water and went back out and slowly poured it over the brake light.I then dried the exterior off with a kitchen towel and let it sit for about 15 minutes. (I have a black truck). I made sure there was no pools of water around the brake light gasket and slowly removed only to find water pooled up inside. Simply from a glass of water. Unreal\u2026Now I have a third brake light that leaks SIGNIFICANTLY worse than it did before.One thing to note, there are people talking about having adhesive on both sides and others on only one side. Mine only had adhesive on one side.Needless to say, I\u2019m pretty aggravated\u2026",
