I had 3x 2gb in it prior so I pulled one and made my it 20gb total. They were plug and play. Well worth the cost. I may get a second set to replace the 2s if I top it out. If you have never installed ram make sure the key slot is on the correct side and it is in the same place on the card. If it is in a different place you have a different set of ram. It is good to pull the old one and line them up to compare. Since a heavy hand and failure to check twice can lead to dead ram or motherboard.",
