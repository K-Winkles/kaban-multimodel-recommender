Since these were on sale at the time I was looking and the few reviews were decent, I decided to go with these. They came to me in a typical ram style box. They installed easy and the XMP profile applied with no problem kicking the ram into their rated timings and speed. The ram has been fast and stable, my system nor games have crashed in over a month since install the ram. The RGB looks nice too if you are a fan like me.",

In my experience the colors that I set kept reverting to default. On launching Windows sometimes it would make my ram crazy colors I never set before. Fix the software and I'll recommend this product, until then it sits in a drawer in my office.",
