                "reviewText": "I used a VERY LARGE assortment of RAM products on my latest project and every component was very high quality, though also quite costly. If you want stuff you know will last, and will WORK. I recommend this brand.I decided to review this particular item because of how well it worked for my particular application - adding numerous attachments (cell phone, tablet, multiple fans and more) to a professional level sim-racing cockpit. (If you are unsure what that is, google TrakRacer TR160 cockpit)Although I have been riding motorcycles/motocross my entire life, I did not use these products for that purpose. I recently built my second cockpit for sim racing using TrakRacers TR160 Aluminum Profile kit and these mounts were AMAZING.The beauty of using aluminum-profile for a project is it has channels to hold everything together with maximum solidity, as well as giving you endless ways to mount accessories. It's used in an endless number of other applications that need solid framework put together in a custom way - like 3D printers.THESE RAM MOUNT TRACK BALLS WITH T-Bolt Attachment allow you to easily put a 1\" ball mount anywhere on an \"80/20\" rig, or any Aluminum Profile rig with channels.The T-Bolt attachment is thin enough to make into a normal channel without having to slide it in from one of the ends, which are typically non-accessible once you've bolted everything together. No need to take anything apart. Simply loosen the internal T-nut so you have enough clearance to get it inside the channel and twist it, then while pulling up to hold the t-bolt firmly inside the channel, simply turn the ball mount to tighten it up. This will add a mount for any 1\" based ball-mount attachments you could need.",
