        "description": "Talia -- Every man in my life, including my father, has betrayed me. My past has made me cynical, twisted my mind, and left bruises that will never fade. Then I\u2019m kidnapped and this big biker swoops in to save the day. I watch as he kills four men, and the blood on his hands should terrify me. Seeing how kind he is when rescuing everyone, how he takes charge and won\u2019t leave anyone behind, makes me wonder if not all men are useless. He says I can trust him, and he wants me to stick around. I\u2019ve always run before, but something about this man makes me want to give him a chance. I only hope I won\u2019t regret it.Ram -- I left my club and never planned to go back. They thought I was dead, and I wanted to keep it that way. But things don\u2019t always go according to plan. I roll up to the gates with six women in tow. One of them I\u2019d love to claim as my own. She\u2019s prickly and defensive, but I find her utterly adorable. I want to keep her, but she pushes me away. When one of the other victims asks to stay with me, I know it\u2019s my one chance to convince Talia to give me a shot. Now I\u2019ve gone from a vigilante with no home to a family man. No matter how many men I have to kill, I will do whatever it takes to keep them safe. Never again will someone hurt those who are precious to me.WARNING: Ram (Devil\u2019s Fury MC) is intended for readers 18+ due to adult content and situations, including human trafficking and mentions of abuse.

When he rescues six women/children, he knows his brothers will have his back. There is one woman that has a fire to her. Talia can\u2019t trust any man. They have all lied to her. When Ram shows up and saves not only her but five others, what can she think? I love that the Badger kept in contact with Ram. He certainly was surprised to hear about Grizzles passing. Ram is more shocked to find out how the club is doing. Riley is the youngest and also someone important in this story. We also have Heather, Anna, Marci, and Renata. I\u2019m sure each will have a story. Since Stitches will be next. We already know Marci will be with him. We also have someone new I didn\u2019t know about, Max aka Lock. He is one of Ram\u2019s friends. I have to say, they need to do something about Farrah and Mariah. Farrah is way too stuck up. In the beginning I liked her being so outgoing but now. She is acting like a prim donna. Let us hope things will change soon and wake her up.",

They don't second guess, nothing in life. They've come so far, and I love their growth.",

Harley Wylde delivers that and does it very well. This book, however, had a more thoughtful, Gentle, responsive Hero in Ram. He seemed to think about his actions, reactions, and how they would affect others and the heroine. He was also a bit more methodical and used his \u201cmom\u2019s psychology\u201d background to his standard\u2019s betterment. Talia was also a little more rounded and questioned Ram\u2019s motivation enough to make him prove himself. It seemed to make this love story less rushed, but still gave me the happy ending that we all crave.",

Ram knows she\u2019s his and their connection is special but he doesn\u2019t push her too hard and is understanding so while you still get a good dose of alpha the way he handles her is softer then other MMC in Harley other books but don\u2019t let that fool you into thinking he\u2019s going to let her walk all over him.
