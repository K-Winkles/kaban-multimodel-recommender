The truck interior is the factory grayish/taupe color and this gray cover I purchased is a close enough match to my eye. It fit over the existing lid snug and precise with three wide elastic bands wrapping underneath. I like the look and stitching and it does seem to add a little extra padding under the elbow. The way the cover was folded for shipping did leave a light crease towards the back/middle, and I hope that it works itself out over time, but overall I'm very happy with this purchase.UPDATE: the shipping crease that I mentioned above did work itself out after installation and a couple of warm sunny days.",

                "reviewText": "I have a 2007 Dodge ram 1500 quad cab. This part is custom fitted for the console for the 2002-2008 ram truck. Mine is exactly like the first picture shown in the ad.I was hopeful, but not confident that it would look as good as the photo shows. Well, it fits perfect! Fits like a glove! No wrinkles around the perimeter of the cover when installed. It looks factory! The only thing I can say negatively is, the cover was twice folded in its packaging, which left a + Sign crease through the whole top. I\u2019m pretty sure with the sun in a hot car, that crease will relax. They really should pack it by rolling the item.I\u2019m not really worried about the crease. I just put it on today, and the crease is minimal looking. I\u2019m sure it will vanish very soon! I really like that the perimeter of the cover is the same leather as the top! Others I have seen have a stretchy fabric perimeter, that I think looks kind of cheesy.My interior is gray, so I kind of wish they made one in gray! But, I just got some beautiful, leatherette seat covers that are gray and black. So for me, the black cover works as one of the black accents through my truck now. If you have this model of truck, you are going to love the look in the fit of it! I am extremely pleased!And, if the company somehow reads this review, I hope you wind up, making them in gray! I\u2019d buy another one, just for the change up in look!Update one day later. The + sign crease is almost gone. Only 1/4 of the + sign crease is visible now. I\u2019m sure it will be gone in a few days. The one thing I left out in my previous review is, the cover doesn\u2019t even move slightly after it\u2019s installed! Like you can take both hands and push on it to get it to slide, and it won\u2019t move. It\u2019s like it\u2019s glued on! This thing, rocks! The quality and the fitment I do not think could be surpassed!I can\u2019t say anything about any other models after 2002\u20132008 about that fitment? All I know is, for my model truck, it can\u2019t be beat! I wish I had it years ago!",
