Only DDR5-enabled CPUs/motherboards support DDR5 memory. Not compatible with DDR4 motherboards.Crucial DDR5 desktop memory modules (UDIMMs) can reach rated speeds with Intel XMP 3.0 or AMD EXPO turned on in the UEFI/BIOS settings. Applicable for all Crucial DDR5 desktop memory (UDIMM) modules except Crucial DDR5-4800 desktop memory, which supports only Intel XMP 3.0. Based on published competitor specs for DDR5 memory as of August 2023. Altering clock frequency or voltage beyond advertised speeds and timing (overclocking) may result in damage to computer components. Micron disclaims any and all liability for such damage.DDR5 speeds are comparable to extreme-performance DDR4 memory speeds and, at 4,800MT/s, at least 1.5x faster than maximum standard DDR4 speeds of 3,200MT/s.Crucial DDR5 Pro Memory modules (UDIMMs) can only be installed in desktops/workstations built to support DDR5 DRAM, such as 12th and 13th Gen Intel Core and AMD Ryzen 7000 Series desktop processors.DDR5 data rate of 6,000MT/s transfers 1.88x the DDR4 data rate of 3,200MT/s.Under memory-intensive workloads, DDR5 can deliver up to 2x the bandwidth, per an internal simulation of dual ranked x8 modules in client platforms.",

I decided to go with the Crucial Pro over the Corsair Vengeance mainly because I lucked out on a very cheap price during a small window of time during Black Friday, and because Crucial's website gave me the clear specifications I needed to know to make the appropriate decision.The only difference between the Pro and the regular version of this is the additional heatsink. Installation was easy as pie. Slide and snap the memory right into your motherboard. At boot up, your computer will (generally) alert you that your RAM amount has changed and will ask you to confirm that. Once my computer started up, I checked my system and it detected the correct amount at 64GB at my system's top 4800MT/s speed.I've been using it now for a month and have had no issues. My computer works great and I can do a lot (a lot) of things without any slowdown. Recommended.",

When I contacted them about the ram being bad they send me a replacement before having me send the original order back. (if you build a computer and don't have any ram it won't work) so since that's how they handled it I can still use my computer in the meantime instead of it being a paperweight until I get the new ram. It's absolutely the best way they could have handled it. 10/10 will buy other parts from them in the future.",

Definitely disappointed. Also, the RMA process with Crucial is not all that user friendly and required talking with a real person to figure out as the return site would not accept the product id # from the RAM. It's unfortunate as I've not previously had issues with Crucial products where I've had to return it but now that I've had to deal with the return process I don't know if I want to risk it again.",
