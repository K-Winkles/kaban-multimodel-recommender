It is almost identical to the original in shape too. The keying seems to work well so far (time will tell), as some of these are poorly made, and fall apart. I haven't had this one long enough to judge its durability, but, with gas prices skyrocketing, and theft on the rise, having this thing may help deter some loser from syphoning my precious fuel. Pretty soon, the cost of this cap will be less than a single gallon....so you decide if it's worth it or not.",

I figured since it could be the gas cap causing an issue, I would \"upgrade\" and get a locking cap. Well, I tested the new cap as much as I could before installing, it seemed to lock and unlock without issue...until I installed it. The key became extremely difficult to insert and take out, then as soon as the key entered, there was no way to unlock the cap. Several people tried it with me, we researched further, YouTube videos, other reviews on this product. We found that we were not alone and we were now in trouble.The only way to get the cap off at this point, according to other reviewers and our YouTube videos, was to pry it off.If this happens to you, please find a straight head and do your best...be mindful that there are a few springs inside that can fall into your tank if you don't catch them in time. Good luck!",

My ring piece was now twitching like a rabbits nose.Finally managed to get what was left of the cap off and filled my tank, luckily I still had the original fuel cap in the truck so I refitted that.This fuel cap is junk, spend your money on something else.",
