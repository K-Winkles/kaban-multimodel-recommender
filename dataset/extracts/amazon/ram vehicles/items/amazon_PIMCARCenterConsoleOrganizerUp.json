                "reviewText": "This organizer fits perfectly and doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s TRYING to be some cheap add m accessory. It looks like it belongs without calling attention to itself with oddball bright colors.Two things:1) while the product images are correct most of the review images appear to be a different organizer. The one I got is straight across the front and does not go into the two small compartments at the very front of the console. This is not a problem and it still keeps stuff from rolling out of those compartments but it does appear to be different than the pictures of most of the reviews.2) this is the one I took off 1 star for - the rubber pads on the bottom of each compartment are glued down with some cheap, barely functioning glue. I was able to lift up on it and peel it away from the tray. It looks kind of ugly under there with the glue but in theory you shouldn\u2019t have to ever separate those pads. If they weren\u2019t glued down they\u2019d probably slide around when the top was opened, but they\u2019re not glued down wry well\u2026..it\u2019s like the designers couldn\u2019t decide whether to glue those pads down or not so they split the difference and ended up gluing them in a way that wasn\u2019t 100 permanent.Good addition to the truck overall.",
