                "reviewText": "Every 3 years, the price of RAM fluctuates from high to low and back again, as all the wafer FAB plants need to retool for never versions of RAM.This month, (July 2022) we are now at all time super LOW price.I have been buying GSKILL ram since 2009. In 2009, I was like 'G-who?' and gave them a try.Today, after assembling hundreds of systems, I believe GSKILLs as good as if not better than Corsair... and wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy better than the overrated Micron OEM and Kingston whole products. Yes, I try other brands occasionally and have done fine with Patriot as well.. but for overall best in class, GSkill is my choice.Lately, been replacing RAM on older 8th, 9th 10th and 11th gen systems (usually DDR4 2300 - DDR 2800) with these GSKill 32 GB 3200 module kits. The reason is simple. I believe RAM has hit an all time low in price and will only go up again.Fear not about the swap out. This RAM slows down in older boards to match the bios settings. And that means if the board fails in a few years, you now have THIS RAM ready for the board replacement.Newbie advice: enter the board bios and set up XMP boost for your RAM, as some boards default to 2133 Ghz. Many board no longer match the RAM speed to the CPU unless the XMP feature is enabled and you press 'save all settings' upon exit.If you were thinking of mixing and matching other brands.. even in different channel slots.. JUST FORGET IT. Super bad idea... as it may boot, but later on, cause system crashes. Instead buy the GKSILL 32 GB set and leave any other open slots alone. Later down the road, you can buy two more identical modules, providing your board has 4 RAM slots.The latest 12th system builds I have been building for myself and clients.. have the bios XMP ready for DDR4 3200 speed RAM. My favorite pairings include the i3-12100 (read the reviews on this CPU, it's powerful) and 4th gen Samsung 980 PRO SSD. My main choice for boards is MSI and if you want to drive many monitors and you are not a gamer, look for the MSI board with FOUR video outputs on the rear that run off the CPU video.",

Install was straight plugin and Windows 10 recognized it immediately. The video editing that had become a nightmare on the old machine was screaming now! Games that could no longer be played worked perfectly with no hiccups. Highly recommend.",
