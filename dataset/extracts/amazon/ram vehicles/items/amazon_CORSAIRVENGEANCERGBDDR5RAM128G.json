Can buying two pairs of 2x48GB of RAM for 192GB work? Also Yes!!Get the latest BIOS firmware available to support using 48GB sticks of RAM. Then check the manufacture if the latest RAM works. In the case of the Asus Prime z690-A it is listed to work at certain configurations. The XMP profile for the RAM available here is set for 40-40-40-77 which also shows works for my mobo however using 4 slots of it had different timings. To do that, I enabled the XMP profile and changed the timing to work with what the manufacture which is listed at for 38-38-38-84. Changing the configuration worked and everything turns on.",

They work at 5600MHz on my workstation although they can reach 6000MHz (have not tested them at that speed yet).I work in video production so I need a substantial amount of free RAM where to allocate/buffer/cache image sequences upon playback, so I needed a solid amount of RAM on my workstation.Please note: you must update your BIOS to the latest AGESA upgrade 1602 (Combo AM5 PI 1.0.0.7c) in order to run this RAM at this speed.Suggestion for installation: install one stick at a time, then boot, set DOCP II and manual speed to 5600MHz for each stick, then reboot, make sure it works, add 2nd stick, then repeat the steps above, then 3rd, then repeat the steps above, then 4th, then repeat the steps above. And that should be it.The workstation will do some memory testing at first upon booting, so do not be alarmed if the workstation doesn't boot during the first 4-5 minutes after the stick installation.Cheers and enjoy!",

Hopefully future firmware updates will enable it, but be sure you\u2019re not paying for extra speed you can\u2019t use (or for capacity that you don\u2019t need.)It is also worth mentioning that the light diffuser on the RAM is a bit flimsy and, for me, often needs to be reseated as it tends to sag so that you can see the bare LEDs.This review may sound a little harsh, but this *is* good RAM.",

Which at first, works fine but then the iCue software that allows you to customize the RGB LED's stops responding and fails to communicate with the RAM. You have to either restart your PC, or power cycle (off for a min, then back on) for the software to behave.It may be that the motherboard RGB software is also interfering (GigaByte Gaming AX B650 board in my case) but I would have expected the software to be a little more finely tuned to avoid such issues.Seems to be a common issue with Corsair RGB RAM and the iCue software, but seems Corsair have no interest to resolve the issues with iCue. If they did, this would have been a 5 star review",
