                "reviewText": "I have a 2023 Ram 1500 Bighorn/Lonestar, and as advertised, this fits the center console perfectly. I love what it has done for my organizational efforts. The armrest box used to get so messy and disorganized so easily, especially after taking a sharper turn. Now, I have my pens, charging cables, and a number of other items neatly organized so that I know where they are, and they are easily accessible.The insert tray is made from a durable, rubber-like material. It is very hard to damage, and it provides an effective non-slip surface. It is also serving as a shield for the original material inside of the armrest box, which can help with resale value if you plan to go that route with your truck.This is a great piece of equipment to have, and for the price, it\u2019s hard to beat.I would like to thank Amazon for allowing me to be a part of their Vine program. My reviews are unbiased, honest, and sincere in an effort to provide you (the customer) with the information you may need in choosing this product or not, and I hope that is what my review accomplishes for you.I would also like to thank the seller \u201cRMOURTEKK\u201d for providing me this product as an Amazon Vine member. I look very forward to owning it and it will be getting plenty of use and exposure to other potential buyers throughout its life with me. Thanks again and I wish you success in your endeavors.",

                "reviewText": "From chaos to organized chaos. If you've had your truck long at all, you know the center console storage is convenient, but you also know it's impossible to keep organized. It's a big open void where you put your stuff. Not really an issue until you lift it up to get to the stuff under it in the lower storage. Then everything slides around and becomes chaos.This doesn't completely eliminate that, but at least now stuff stays in the general area where it was placed. One of the more important things is the slot that I assume is made for pens, works great to hold an Epi-pen. No worries about having to dig through the chaos if I need it. I have a before/after photo of the tray, with all the same stuff in it. It's not a night/day difference, but it is better.The tray comes with rubber mats (just like the OEM mat) that fit into each slot. They're a little tricky to line up just right, but that also means they don't have unnecessary gaps.The tray fit into my console perfectly. I took the OEM mat out, but I don't know if I needed to. I just assumed, but doing so, it fit like a glove.",

As you can see in the pic, the one I received is a slightly different version without the change holders of which the 80's called and wants them back!

This Center Console Organizer Rates Real High on the Claydog Approval Scale!! Enough Said, Wrench Drop!! Thanks for your time, Claydog",

The rubber inside helps your items stay in place and is much nicer than the felt on the factory console. It has a coin tray which is unnecessary as the truck already has one in the center console. I would prefer for that to not be there so the space could be utilized. But it has helped me organize the console instead of it just being a junk drawer. Excellent product.",
