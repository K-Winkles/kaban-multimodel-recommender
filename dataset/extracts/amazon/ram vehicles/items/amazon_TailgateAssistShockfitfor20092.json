For this quality, they can probably charge more - but don\u2019t tell the company that. LOLIt\u2019s rare to find a product that works really well, easy to install with a great price point.

I was very lucky a Customer Service Rep got in touch with me from my original review and even through I broke this item attempting to remove it to make an adjustment, this company stands behind it's products!!!!! She without hesitation shipped me not just the gas shock.I broke, but a whole new full kit, wow! I was able to replace my broken shock in about 5 minutes and now the assist works perfectly. It's so rare when a company not only stands behind a product, even more rare when someone goes.out of their way to contact YOU based on your.product rating which was originally positive (see below) to replace something I broke during installation. I can tell you I will refer people to them who are truck owners. I dont think I've had a positve experience like this from any other vendor on amazon. Buy with confidence folks!!!I really like the product but I had to disconnect the gas shock from the tailgate lower side.to make a cable adjustment and I assume one of the clips broke attempting to take it back off and now the gas shock wont attach to the tailgate. Hoping they sell a replacement gas shock so I dont have to buy the whole kit just to get that.",

                "reviewText": "I had to have my tailgate replaced on my 2019 Ram 1500 and as a result the clips on the strut were damaged. I ordered a replacement and the lower connection failed numerous times dropping the tailgate with a slam. I carefully removed both the upper and lower clips and placing one on top or the other, and found the lower clip to be lesser in design than the upper bringing me to the opinion that this was the cause for the failure. I'm not sure if quality control is a priority with manufacturers anymore, but this person was certainly asleep at the wheel or in the restroom. I would return this item and seek a refund, but thinking I wouldn't have a problem, I tossed the packaging and items I thought I didn't need. Shame on me. Lesson learned.",

Not knowing what I was doing and trying to follow the directions and also a video on YouTube it took me about an hour. Now that I\u2019ve done it, it is so easy and could do it again in about 20 minutes or less. The directions say to remove the rubber bumper, but the video didn\u2019t. I left the rubber bumper and it works great with leaving it. Great addition to my truck. I totally recommend it. I told my brother and he bought one the next day and he loves it. It\u2019s not that often I\u2019m pleased with what I buy from Amazon, but this time I was totally happy. Normally it\u2019s too big or too small or doesn\u2019t work like they said it would. But this time I\u2019m Very pleased. Great purchase.",

                "reviewTitle": "Upgraded to a 4 - Better materials, but original lifespan was accurate",
                "reviewText": "Purchased for a RAM 1500 tail gate.Purchased again as a replacement for the first one. Lasted just over a year before the ball stud failed at the tailgate end - sheared off, and the shaft for the piston was bent. Was expecting the same kit and for it to last another year - the functionality is worth it for my spouse.Pleasantly surprised that they revamped their rivnut tool (although I checked the rivnut better this time too). Recommendation to provide both a 1/4-20 screw and the metric one, so that those of us with access to proper rivnut insertion tools (and our own 1/4-20 rivnut) can choose the best one for the application. Insertion of the metric one went much better this time.They also adapted the stud at the tail gate end of the cylinder with a plate that both shortens the run when relaxed (tail gate up) and extends the angle for deployment. Thus the rivnut is not bearing all the force of the movement of the cylinder in a non-circular factory hole. The plate they install over it is supported by the hinge and clamped by the screw, and makes the system truly driver side only (although that is not an issue as you only need one if it is working properly).The remainder of the install was unchanged, so did not have to use those parts. Definitely an improvement, because it took me longer to find and put away the right tools than to do the repair. Glad they paid attention to feedback, and I have more confidence that this ball stud will not shear.Original install history is below:The initial kit inspection looked fine, but once put into use it was a mess.First, the rivnut is for 6mm, and aluminum of the type used for fibreglass panels in vehicles, not steel. The tool supplied was inadequate, as it did not split the rivnut properly - it pulled one side enough to burst and trap the rivnut, but then twisted and bound on the nut and it stripped. I had greased the tool too, anticipating this (lots of work with rivnuts), but it failed on the second backing off and what felt like the burst on the other side. I have 1/4-20 tooling, but of course the ball stud for the shock is 6mm, so it does not fit, so I will have to investigate a new mandrel for my tool. I managed to get it most of the way done by purchasing 6mm bolts at the hardware store and reproducing the tool, but in the end I believe I have stripped the rivnut. I tried to chase the rivnut with a tap, but that was what broke it free and spun it. I was able to get the stud most of the way in, but I have no way to hold the rivnut and turn the stud the last 1/8\", so it is loose. I am looking for a 1/4-20 threaded ball stud to replace it with and use proper short side squeeze rivnuts in the application. Just crap parts.Second, the guard that they supply for the support strap did not go on as advertised, and instead tore off the covering for the wire. This will need to be shaved down and heated to soften before install. The inside diameter is much larger than the wire and the covering. Not ideal at all in a northern salt climate.Third, the kit can be installed on the passenger and driver side of my vehicle - all the comments about it not fitting are wrong - there is absolutely no difference from side to side other than the orientation. If I find suitable replacement bottom ball stud hardware, I will likely buy the second one and balance the support - while the hinges are robust, the loading on them is now unbalanced because of the restriction on the one side, and it will wear them prematurely.I have not engaged customer support - Even if they sent me the replacement parts, I would still need to pull them out and re-install, and if they are the same parts they are still the wrong ones for the job and I do not anticipate a different outcome.It was my mistake to have proceeded with the wrong parts in the first place trusting that they knew what they were doing and that the quality would be there. Lesson learned.",
