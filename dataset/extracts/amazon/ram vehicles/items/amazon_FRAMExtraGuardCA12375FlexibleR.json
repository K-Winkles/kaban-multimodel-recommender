I live in the Desert, so I prefer filters that offer protection from the sand and smaller particles that float around out here and this filter does that well. It keeps the sand on the intake side of the airbox and out of my engine, and lets my 5.7l Hemi Ram 1500 breath like it was meant to. I normally stick to oem products, but for air filters I go with Fram when available and I have never had any issues. At $19.29, this filter is about the same price as the ones at autopart stores, so if you can afford to wait a few days for the shipping then it's worth ordering.",
