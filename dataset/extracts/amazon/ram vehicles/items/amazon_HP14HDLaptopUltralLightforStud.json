                "reviewText": "The 16 gb ram is a great deal.One thing that was weird was the speakers making a noisy static sound when I was watching a movie. But I went into volume settings & turned it to mono audio (combine left n right audio) and it stopped. Ive only had it a day so I will come back and update if anything else happens but it hasnt done the static sound since. Could just be because its brand new, I didnt have volume up super high or anything. Gonna go ahead and buy a speaker to plug into it just in case, I cant complain because of the price. A $20 speaker is an easy trade off to have a high quality laptop with a low budget.I havent had a laptop for years, Ive missed it and I think I made a great choice. I was surprised at how lightweight it is, and it doesnt get super hot even after streaming live video almost all day. I watch twitch a LOT and this lil guy is doing a great job. I love the metallic light pink color too.Wanted to write a review since there arent any I can see for this yet, I was kinda worried about buying something with no reviews but it has turned out just fine so far (besides the weird static thing, but like I said it hasnt happened again yet). I'm writing this review from it right now!! Lol. Worth every penny. The ethernet connector also works great its the main way Im getting internet to it for now",

                "reviewText": "Very simple and functional yet it has all of the essentials without any of the gimmicky frills. Maybe it takes a $300 laptop so I don't have to deal with built in Alexa-enabled something, HP-specific ports, fingerprint scanner, and other stuff I don't want or need. They don't try anything fancy with this one which for me is a positive. Plus it's TKL keyboard which really should be the new norm. Does not have a backlit keyboard which is a slight miss but for the price it's not a huge deal.You can take it out of S-mode easily and remove a lot of the addons and you have yourself a perfectly functional Windows machine. Despite the lower-tier hardware it still starts up very quickly if you make sure you don't have too much bloatware. Sure it's a little slow at times but if you're using it for day to day tasks it should be fine. Battery life seems very good, the laptop is also fairly lightweight as well. What more could you ask for at this price point.",

You will be bullied to use Microsoft Edge. Ignore that. Overall, super happy with this purchase!",
