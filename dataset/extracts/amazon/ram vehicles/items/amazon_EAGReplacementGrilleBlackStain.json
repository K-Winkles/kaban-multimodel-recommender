I was a little weary about the product at first due to never hearing of the company and the price point was almost half of what the big names sell the grille for. But am I glad I bought this grille. It looks stunning and is holding up to everything living in the desert can throw at it and still looks flawless. Solid product and I will be buying more from this company",
