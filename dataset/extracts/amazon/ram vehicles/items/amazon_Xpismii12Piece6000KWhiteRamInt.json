It\u2019s not straightforward and you\u2019ll likely break something if you don\u2019t.One complaint is that the dome light is SO annoyingly bright! I used some white spray paint on the inside of my dome light cover to tone it down to about half of the brightness and it\u2019s so much better. I appreciate bright lights but the dome was just too bright. It\u2019s all a matter of preference.I would have given 5 stars if the dome wasn\u2019t so bright and there were instructions included on how to do the map light bulbs or a link to a YouTube video.

                "reviewText": "This LED light kit for Rams 2019 and up came packaged very well so nothing was damaged. Each LED works great.The brightness is as advertised and a great improvement over the factory lights. Installation was not an issue because each LED is within size specs. The back light will require some clamping due to the way its made, but this holds true for any brand LED for the dome light. Just put it in, hold it, and clamp the connectors until it is snug.I've used far more expensive LEDs in my other truck. I can't tell the difference between this kit and the other one. Only time will tell how long they last. Overall, this is a must have upgrade.",
