The clips were my biggest struggle. I'd recommend buying new spring clips before starting. My truck is a 2017 and the clips were nearly unusable. They were rotten enough that they lacked any spring or temper. These lights are much brighter than the originals.",

                "reviewText": "These replacement lamps were relatively easy to install. While underneath the vehicle you can see where the light penetrates the bumper. Just forward of the light there is a small lip that is attached to a clip that secures the light. Pry the clip toward the front of the vehicle and the light will be freed and can be removed from above. Obviously you will have to unplug it first. Set the new light in the opening. Then plug the resistor into the old plug and new light. The clip will go into the cavity between the bumper and a piece of reinforcement. Slide the clip back making sure to engage both the bottom and top of the new light. Secure the resistor and loose wires with a few zip ties.I think the kit included zip ties but I'd recommend buying new spring clips before starting. My truck is a 2015 and the clips were nearly unusable. They were rotten enough that they lacked any spring or temper.These lights are much brighter than the originals. The light is slightly blue but it doesn't bother me. Remember you could alternatively just replace the 194 bulbs in the existing housing with LEDs but they would not be nearly as bright",
