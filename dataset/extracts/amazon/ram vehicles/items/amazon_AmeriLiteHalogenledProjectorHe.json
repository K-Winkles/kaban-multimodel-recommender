Don't waste your time buying those, everything about them was horrible!!!!These AmeriLite headlights look awesome, they popped right in without any hassle and also came with the higher end bulbs and OEM style adjustments. They also came with the conversion wiring kit incase you don't have projector lights to begin with. I thought i would have to buy brighter bulbs just because these are technically a knock-off (non OEM) assembly but i was wrong. They are extremely bright.These were well worth the extra $100 bucks compared to that other junk",

                "reviewText": "First some background. I have a 09 Ram 1500 with the original headlight housing. I have used true HID, xenon, and LED bulbs in the past and my High and Low beams were one bulb. I was hesitant to order these because I felt some information was left out and there wasn't a lot of pictures or explanations. First picture is off and compared the originals. Second running lights on, I do not have DRL so these only come on as a parking light unless you have DRL. Third is Turn signal, they are not sequential but they are bright. Forth is the beam pattern on low and lastly the beam pattern on high.Install was a breeze. Took all of 15 min. All bolts are 10mm. Remove the top fan cover by popping it off, Then you have access to the bolts for the grill, 4 in total. After the grill removal you have access to the two bolts for the lights. Behind the mud guard is the access for the retaining latch, push up and the lights come right out. Install is the same steps but backwards. The green plug is headlights and the black plug is turn signals. On the driver side you will need to drill an access hole to adjust the beam up and down. No big deal, a hole large enough for a long Phillips head screw driver.Adjusting the beam to proper height is also pretty simple. Find the little divot on the lens and measure to the ground. Find a flat surface and something to measure the beam height, I used a warehouse. Have your headlights 25' from the surface you want to use to adjust your beams. At 25' you want about 2\" of drop. So my lights are 3' 1\" from the ground, at the wall I dropped them down to 2' 11\". This gives you a gradual drop and doesn't effect on coming traffic.Both High and Low beams are bright but do have some hot and cold spots. I am replacing them with slim fit LEDs but I suspect they will have hot and cold spots as well. The beam is nice and straight with the exception of the center of the light beam which is common in projection lights. I do wish there was a horizontal adjustment screw.These come with a hyper flash module to prevent hyper flash and currently have no light out warnings or hyper flash.For the money these are great. The seals look good. The only issue I have with these are the placement of the height adjustment screw (easy fix) and the passenger side plug was slightly damaged upon arrival but I have reached out to the seller to resolve this. I would recommend these to anyone looking to swap out their OEM headlights. For the features and looks the price is on point.I plan on to revisit this within 6 months to a year for a follow up on these lights. Hope all this information helps!",

Was very worried because price wise they're less than half what you would pay for low priced high end headlights but the build quality is actually quite good. I didn't bother even trying to use the lights that were sent with them and just put in LEDs. The only issue I've had is that the DRL don't run unless the lights are on (I didn't have DRL before) and when the lights are on when you turn the blinker on it flashes a parking light out message due to the DRLs sharing the parking light. Small sacrifice to make for such a low cost. Ive taken the truck through the car wash once and driven in a HEAVY storm and have had zero moisture issues. Overall really great looking and quality headlights. Definitely would buy again.",

Very easy to install, although they said the they come with H7 (which I switch to LED) they actually came with H11. The clarity is perfect and they look a little different but good. The daytime running lights are still amber but at night it switches to white. Very bright too (with LED).I would recommend!",
