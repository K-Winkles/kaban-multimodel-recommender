                "reviewText": "I'm a pilot and I rely on both a Microsoft Surface and an iPad Air 2 in the cockpit, and I'm happy to say that both work really well in this cradle.I'm also happy to say that the construction quality is very good. I've dropped mine, stuffed it into all sorts of cramped flight bags and generally treated it pretty roughly, and it still looks and works like new. The parts that matter are all metal and strong enough for demanding use. A few of the other brands I've tried might be lighter, but the plastic parts some of them use just never held up well for me.My Surface tends to fit directly in the cradle (I don't use a case), and the iPad fits in the standard Apple leather case (but probably not a thicker case). Both fit well in either portrait or landscape mode and are solid enough to be secure in turbulence - I've yet to have an issue of either tablet popping out of the mount in rough air. I also like that the little clamps remain mostly out of the way - doesn't block the camera, microphone, ports, buttons, etc - although the iPad is somewhat challenging to press the various side buttons.One of the great things about RAM is that you can buy the individual mounting pieces you need to create a custom mount, and you can use the same cradle in many different ways. In one of the planes I fly, there's a 1\" ball mounted on the panel and I'm able to connect a short articulating arm to this cradle for a perfect fit. Other aircraft I fly don't have this mounting ball, so I use a RAM suction cup to attach the cradle to the side of the windshield, or one of the RAM clamps to clamp the cradle to the yolk. Very convenient being able to carry a single cradle, yet having all these options.One very small issue is that the back plate tends to be insulating and so my tablets tend to get fairly hot, especially if I leave the cradle in the aircraft on a hot day. A major improvement would be a way to have some sort of small heat sinks on the back of the cradle to help with this, but it's overall a pretty minor issue.This is pretty much the perfect cradle for a larger tablet - definitely worth a look if you need to mount your tablet in any sort of boat, vehicle or airplane.",

I expected more from Ram Mount when I ordered this. I was disappointed in it after a day or so after using it. The cheap rubber bumpers they have on these are just that, cheap. No glue or even a bit of tape was included with mine. The bumpers fall off constantly if I\u2019m not careful. I understand I\u2019m technically exceeding the size limit of 12\u201d so that\u2019s why I\u2019m not dropping down to 1 star. On the positive side the holder arms are actually made of metal not plastic. The bumpers push on to them and will need to find some glue to keep them on. Also might need a drop or 2 of WD40 on the inside of the mount. Mine is a bit stiff and sticks when opening up the clamps.",
