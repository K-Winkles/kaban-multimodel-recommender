However, after about 10ish minutes a display showed and everything booted up normally, I'm assuming memory training? and every once in while it will take a little (15 - 30 seconds nothing major) to get to windows, Im assuming it's due to the 6000 xmp setting because with ram set at the default 4000 something it boots into windows in about 3-5 seconds, but have been running stable for 2 months.I have read 6000 is sometimes a hit or miss \"overclock\" depending on bios and mobos, so I'm not discounting that I may have just got lucky with the silicon lottery",
