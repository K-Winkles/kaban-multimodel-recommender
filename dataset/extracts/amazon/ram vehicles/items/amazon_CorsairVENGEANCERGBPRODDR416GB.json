                "reviewText": "Amazon review-combining-proofing: Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4 3200 (PC4-25600) C16 Desktop Memory - Black (I'll stop doing this when Amazon stops combining reviews for unrelated products)I bought this for a new motherboard build (Asus ROG Strix B450-F Gaming Motherboard (ATX) AMD Ryzen 2 AM4 DDR4 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core, 12-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor with Wraith Stealth Cooler). The fit was quite a bit tighter than I'm used to, so the first stick took me awhile to get seated. Once I figured out how much pressure to apply, the second stick went in more easily, and now I'm not worried about them being loose.The RGB was a nice novelty, and Corsair's iCue Software allows you to sync the lights with Asus' Aura (with an iCue plugin for Aura). That said, I have the RGB turned off now, as the novelty wore off after a day or so.There's not much else I can say, since I don't overclock my PC. It works, right out of the box, requires no configuration in BIOS, and Windows 7 recognizes that I have 32GB of RAM. Right now, I have about 25-30 tabs open in Firefox, several Windows Explorer windows open, and I'm listening to music on Winamp, and using 18% of available memory.I'm pretty happy, especially considering that, back in the day, I used to have to pay this much for a couple of sticks of 4 or 8 MB RAM.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. These are bright and colorful lights with a plenty of customization while retaining excellent performance. My first purchase of two 8GB 3200mhz had no issues at first. It even worked with my msi motherboard mystic light, but over time it would have compatibly issues with lighting which eventually pushed me back to Cosair's software lighting.One issue that was immediately apparent was using sleep mode. Often times the ram sticks would stay on despite the pc being in sleep mode. This was further exaggerated when I purchase 2 more sticks. My workaround was to turn the brightness down to 0 whenever I put the system in sleep. I tried using hardware lighting, but it was never consistent.The second roadblock I had is when I added 2 more sticks. My system stared giving me ram errors constantly and I couldn't even push the full 3200mhz at the start. Somehow swapping the old pair with the new and placing the old pair in the B slots fixed the issue with speed and errors. Its been well over a year with no issues. This could be a misstep on my part.Even with msi mystic lighting, they would flicker when syncing with msi lighting. Eventfully falling back to having separate software for lighting they still have plenty of built in lighting effects to choose from.Despite all the issues, they're still very functional while retaining its eye candy. All the effects or smooth and customizable. You still have excellent speeds, and they're not bulky. Maybe I miss a step when I chose to install these but the issues were never really at a non functioning problem. Likely a incompatibility issue with my set of hardware. They're nice to to have, just be wary of these issues you may encounter.",
