                "reviewText": "These work perfectly inside of that head lamp assembly. However, the one bulb appears to be a little bit loose so you have to put the cord that goes to it to put tension on it as opposed to just leaving it flopping around. That's pretty easy to do inside of the headlight assembly and the headlight assembly is actually sealed with a cover so it being loose isn't the biggest of stuff but it could have been tighter like the other bulb simply clicked into place",

Even then I can barely see anything in the dark. I wish I would have just saved the money I spent and applied it to a more expensive and reputable kit. The kit I plan on replacing this kit is $300 but guaranteed to work and has a warranty. This kit was cheap. I was cheap and I got a cheap partially working kit. You get what you pay for.",
