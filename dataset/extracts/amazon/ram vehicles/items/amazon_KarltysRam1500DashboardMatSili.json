                "reviewText": "I got this to place on the dash of my Ram 1500 and it fits perfectly into the recess on the dash directly over the stereo and heat controls. The pad is made of some type of rubber and it is very pliable and soft to the touch. The pad arrived rolled up in a plastic bag and even though it doesn't have a great deal of memory to it, there was some curl to it for the first couple of days. After it finally warmed up enough it lays perfectly flat in the recess as it was intended to do. I only have one complaint and that is even though it's (rubber) it still slides around on my dash. I like this pad and wish to use it but, I will have to place some double stick tape under it if I plan on using it to hold things while I drive. I tried to clean my dash incase there was some extra vinyl protectant or Armor-all but, to no avail it still slides around. So that is a little bit frustrating but over all if you don't mind a little bit of something tacky under it, then this is for you. If you prefer not then look some where else for a different dash pad.",

Doesn't do much in the way of rolling items because the lips around the perimeter arent very high. Regardless, it stops the bulk of things from sliding around. I'm just as happy if not more happy with how much better the dash looks vs how it was without it! Very nice oem look. Soft like half rubber half silicone. I like it.
