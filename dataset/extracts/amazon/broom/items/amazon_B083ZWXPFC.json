I am constantly cleaning up after working on a project, and I am tired of the old flat dust pan that only holds a little, bends and breaks when I fill it up. I have gone through so many dust pans it is crazy.I found this one and had to give it a try. So easy to use, it holds a lot of waste/dust/dirt and whatever else lands on the floor. Just drop it down, give it a press and lock the handle in place. Now I can broom with two hands and fill the large dustpan up until it is full. I give it a press to unlock the handle, take it to the garbage can and easily dump it out. You can also leave it unlocked and go around with one hand on the dustpan and use the included little dust broom and pick up stuff all over, here and there. Great for outside cleaning up whatever doesn't belong there.This dustpan is easy to use, very convenient, sturdy and holds a lot. The 2 pack gives me a back which the wife already stole for the house. She loves it as well. This is a great value for the price and we both give it 5 stars.",

Brool is easy to use and they store as one unit The only negative about this set is that it does not include a rake on the dust pan to remove hair and other junk from the broom head. They have a little saw tooth edge on the dust pan but that's totally useless for removing dog hair out of the broom.",

                "reviewText": "This product is more than expected in quality and design not to mention the very affordable price; you get more than the value of your money. Easy to assamble and lightweight. We've been trying same style of dust pans of recognized brands, more expensive and we have returned them becuase of design disfunction.Definately a keeper!

                "reviewText": "These broom/dustpan sets seem to work fine. They are short, but that's the way they were supposed to be and it works for a quick sweep up. My only complaint is that one of the dustpans arrived with a piece broken out of the bottom (broken piece was in box). I taped the hole and I think it's still usable. I'm guessing I could have returned it, but wasn't really worth it if I could make it work.",

                "reviewText": "It seems like great quality. I like the fact that the dust pan is solid, when a dustpan has rubber on the end it seems to always end up warping then its worthless. This one doesn't leave a dust line when you sweep into it. The broom is pretty short so I still have to keep a regular sized broom near if I want to do more than spot sweep. It's great if the kids want to help sweep. The bristles are pretty stiff which I did not like at first but honestly it is starting to grow on me. I noticed that the stiffer bristles actually pick up more dust and dirt than my regular broom.",
