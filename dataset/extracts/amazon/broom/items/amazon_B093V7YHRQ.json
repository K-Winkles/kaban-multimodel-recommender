                "reviewText": "I got this because I had a similar one before for my hardwood floors and it worked very well and this one came with a dustpan that attached to the collapsible handle. I do like the large dustpan that sits flat on the floor (and therefore allows all the dirt to be easily swept into it) held in place with your foot. But the handle is flimsy (the pieces don't all fit well together so the pole doesn't feel strong). The rubber bristles aren't firm enough to get the dirt and hair off the rug well in my opinion. Also, the thin rubber on the dustpan easily warps (i.e., doesn't stay flat) so the dirt doesn't all get into the pan on one sweep. I'll keep this set, but will look for a better one.",

I just used it on my carpet that had a lot of dog hair and pieces of torn up cardboard on it. I have back problems and can\u2019t bend over and pick up the box pieces my puppy tears up. This work amazing and I couldn\u2019t be happier. It is very sturdy, maybe the others didn\u2019t put it together right. Also, I love the dust pan, all I have to do is step on it and sweep in.",

The corners and edges. Even the furniture!!I also tried it as a dog brush and it worked great for that too!!You'll be amazed on how much dirt and hair this broom will sweep up. Not to mention how wonderful the adjustable angle broom head is!!",

This broom did the job. However, the handle isn\u2019t that sturdy because of how it adjusts, so you can\u2019t really apply a ton of pressure when using the broom. Overall I would still recommend with the caveat that you need to be slightly gentle when using.",
