They love to help clean up and these are real brooms, just a smaller size more easily used by children. They have real corn straw for the bristles and lovely wooden handles - although the handles are a bit too long for two-year olds. My little ones use these every day for real and pretend sweeping and, more recently, for riding - hey, their imaginative play is what I live for! My only reservation is that the bristles come off or break off fairly easily - of course, my little ones are rough with them. BUT I would buy these again because they are vastly superior to a plastic toy broom.",
