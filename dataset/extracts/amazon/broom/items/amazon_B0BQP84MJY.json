                "reviewText": "i needed a broom that could clear packed snow, broken ice, residual road salt and general debris from around my apartment building.the price made me a bit leery because Home Depot and Lowe's have \"similar\" but 1, their prices were over $20, and 2, the bristles were nowhere near as firm as i needed. so i bit the bullet, cried once and paid twice for 2 of these brooms.i am so glad i did. these thing are sturdy and they made a 2 hour job get done in 30 minutes.now the reason i bought two is that if one breaks, then i have a spare and even then the spare is used for just for inside duty. which i took it to my carpet's high traffic areas after i vacuumed and while the bristles are firm and tough enough for outdoor use, they're still pliable enough and fine enough to aggravate carpet to loosen and thereby allowing my vacuum cleaner to get more dirt up and out.now to the down points.1. the packing. each broom was delivered separately in a cardboard box measuring 5 feet long, 14 inches wide and 8 inches deep.don't get me wrong, i sincerely appreciate the care for product but i checked with my local post office, UPS store and FedEx local. in one box there literally is enough room that 3 to 4 brooms could fit and still packed securely. for me to ship an item like the items were shipped to me would have been as low as $30 to as high as $50. for each broom.down point number 2...dang there isn't one.but in a nutshell, this is a great item, at an OUTSTANDING price. i highly, HIGHLY, would recommend it for others to purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I use this broom in my kennel, and puppy room to clean up messes, and I have used it outside, as well. This thing is tough as nails, the only issue I have with it is that the handle keeps unscrewing itself and that drives me absolutely crazy, if I can find a regular broom handle for this thing it would be a five Star product. Unfortunately none of these things you order off of here ever come with a regular handle I know I know, it's hard to ship a long object but come on people these handles don't lock in there's no way to keep it from unscrewing as you're using it so every few seconds of sleeping I have to tighten the handle up again that's annoying I thought about loctite or even Teflon tape like you would use to tighten up your bathroom shower head or something like that though I have not done it yet. My father bought something else that had a handle like this and he put some screws through it but he's got a drill and I don't at the moment. So that has not been something that I have been able to accomplish but other than that the broom head on this is extremely stiff it will definitely move heavier objects it will move dog poopy, in a kennel room and anything else that they happen to tear up which is extremely important another room I had would not even move those objects at all and that was an issue that I was dealing with where I could not just sweep in there if there was an accident or somebody decided to tear up some paper or a fluffy toy got absolutely destroyed and there was fluff everywhere this room definitely will cover all of that and outdoor as well I use it also to sweep my front porch off on a regular basis and it never leaves behind anything I've even swept the little dirt space between my back door and my kennel where I let the dogs out pathway after a particularly bad rainstorm were small branches pine cones and three particulates came down in my path and it moved them with no problem I would definitely recommend this for dirty Jobs I used to do, new construction cleaning and I would definitely recommend it for that too it would probably be perfect I'm sure that this would move cut off pieces of two by fours as well it's Steph but it still moves sand and grit as well. Very much a fan for everything except for the darn handle but that I can remedy myself. And you're not going to get any non-peast together handles here on Amazon that's just how they send these things maybe a viable thing would be to go to home Depot or Lowe's and buy a universal broom handle that can be used or use one off a cheaper room that you buy somewhere maybe one of those ones that wouldn't move everything you needed to move anyway I like it I use it daily I'm happy with the product the only reason why I gave it a four star originally was the handle",

                "reviewText": "So I bought this because I mean for 6.99 you can afford the risk and if it doesn't work for indoor well then you have a nice outdoor broom. But really...why are you sweeping outdoors anyway? That's where the dirt comes from... >..<It's declared to be an outdoor broom and some reviews that have chosen not to read decided to leave bad reviews for their lack of thoroughness and imagination. I say CHOOSE YOUR DESTINY! If you want this to be an indoor broom, so be it! I am using it indoors. Is it stiff? Yes. Is it sturdy? Yes. Apparently indoor brooms are supposed to bend, hence why everyone's brooms develop that Fanned Out \"Flip\" look. They are brooming too hard. This broom yes, it is stiff. BUT if you are like me and have a lot of cat litter or tracks of dirt from the outside or food crumbs from your kids this is a great option! Not only does it sweep up efficiently (little learning curve with the bristles but who cares?) but the angled edge helps with hard to reach corners. It also makes for a great air guitar. Bottom line: BUY IT!!!!",

                "reviewText": "These are great outdoor brooms. No they won't sweep the finest dust, but they're not designed for that. I love them for snowy days when there's only 2-3\" of snow on the decks and walkways around my house. You can sweep it aside much faster than shoveling it. Spring and summer leaf and seedling debris is also easy to clear with these.My only complaint is they are making these cheaper than ever quality wise. I thought my older version was getting worn down, but it's in better shape than these are. Quickie needs to stop playing games and make them like they used too. There's enough junk on the market. Is this how they want to waste their reputation? I certainly won't order another sight unseen. Plus, I ordered two and each one was shipped in its own large box separately. Surely they could ship them together and use the savings to make them like they used to.These are not bad, but they used to be a lot better and more sturdy.",
