Screw the handle together & attach the broom head.Normally i use a stick vac on my kitchen floor because my old broom didn't get everything (crumbs, hair etc) when i used it. Now i dont even use the stick vac at all!This one has a wide head, long & angled bristles & long handle. You can get in corners easily and it get absolutely everything on the floor in less strokes because it covers a larger area.Not only do i use it on my kitchen floor but i works perfect on outdoor carpet ( my back porch) and i use it on my front porch as well. Nothing sticks to it so you are not carrying around the hairs that are laying around. My son and daughter shed hair like crazy so it makes my happy that the hairs do not stick to it when i am sweeping. It doesnt come with a dust pan but i have one so its not a big deal.It would also be a great broom for the garage as well. super durable and lightweight. This will be my broom for a very long time.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this broom to sweep my long asphalt driveway which is very rough. I had no trouble putting it together. And the handle\u2019s 4 pieces seemed to be high quality and all screwed in very tightly making a strong metal handle. But as you work all the pieces it keep coming loose and while it still works it doesn\u2019t feel solid when the handle can rotate while you\u2019re trying to work . I feel like it needs to lock in place to not have to constantly keep tightening every 5 mins. Really frustrating for me but I\u2019m a bit of a perfectionist.My other issue which was more of a functional problem was that the bristles were so stiff it made it hard to sweep because they had practically no give to them. Therefore when you have a very rough surface like my driveway it just sort of skips over the surface and doesn\u2019t sweep unless you push really hard and you just can\u2019t keep that up for more than a few sweeps before your wrist starts to ache (I\u2019m an average shape 35 yr old man). sent it back and got a different push broom that was cheaper, had one piece handle, and had softer bristles (very happy with that one).",

I opened this inside and put the handle together very easily. Then I realised I could use on the side of the oven and side of fridge etc that I could never reach before! I went and swept the courtyard. Along edges under chairs that I always hated moving in the past! Amazing I love this broom!! I\u2019ll buy another now just in case I can\u2019t get this in the future if I ever need one! Thank you!!",
