                "reviewText": "I will admit that I bought this for the lovely aqua blue color. It is an extremely cute set, and it fits in with my late grandmother's decor. It was her favorite color! That being said, it is a nice set for lightweight sweeping jobs inside the home rather than heavier jobs involving gravel or pebbles, etc. I would recommend a metal standing dustpan and a heavier quality broom for jobs like that. It's ideal for a disabled person such as myself. I had no trouble carrying it downstairs. The broom and the dustpan attach together and can be stored comfortably in most closets. I quite like the bent holder on the dustpan; it makes it comfortable and easy to grip. The broom has soft bristles and is perfect for indoor, lightweight jobs. The assembly directions--as some other reviewers have noted--are in very small print. I recommend a magnifying glass or good reading spectacles to see them clearly. One helpful hint is that the two 'C' pieces have dark ends on them. It helps to differentiate from the similar 'D' and 'F' pieces. Also, the curved handle is for the dustpan and the straight handle is for the broom. The broom handle was shipped on the wrong end of the 'F' handle, but I figured it out! I recommend this adorable product for basic household jobs. I'm very glad that I bought it!",

                "reviewText": "Stylish to say the least but that would be to actually say the most. This thing is beautiful but all the things that make a broom great are missing along with the dust pan. I saw good reviews and loved the aqua color that matches all my household things but every single time I try to use it, i hate myself for ordering this setup online. IT FALLS APART IN MY HAND!!!!! It\u2019s not sturdy enough to stay together. I guess I could have possibly gotten a dud and maybe that\u2019s why the broom handle doesn\u2019t stay together. I get it\u2019s lightweight but I\u2019m literally just trying to clean up chip crumbs and the simplest of things. But wait folks there\u2019s more\u2026 or less I should say. The dust pan does stay together and I actually Love the clip the broom hooked to it but the purpose of a dust pan is to pick up the dirt you sweep into it so you can throw it out. I was excited about the rubber lip part that looked like it would help pick up more dirt but for some reason it never gets close enough to the floor to not leave a huge mess under the dust pan when you move it away. I\u2019ve tried pressing down more to try and solve this issue but nothing has worked. So after trying to keep my broom together in one hand, I\u2019m having to extra sweep a hole debris line behind every dirt pile I make. It\u2019s exhausting. So yeah. Cute to look at but does not work for me for some reason. Instead of making my life easier, it just makes cleaning more frustrating :/ hopefully just got a dud.",

                "reviewText": "I got this today, put it together in a jiffy, and then immediately started sweeping my leaf-cluttered lanai after long delays and excuses. In short, this dustpan-broom set made sweeping sort of fun! It certainly made it easier. The cap of plastic on the broom initially had a tendency to come off, so I struck it a few times with my mallet and that solved it. Works well: the dustpan sits open and stands up when you 'park' it, but it folds easily otherwise. The broom has flexible bristles. Good buy.",
