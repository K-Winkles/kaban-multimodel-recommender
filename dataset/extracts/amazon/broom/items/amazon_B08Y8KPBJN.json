In other words, I have to tighten after each stroke of the broom or the broom part falls off of the stick, imagine this when sweeping a large area, sweep then tighten.Although sturdy, easy to assemble, & durable it must be capable of doing the job it was created to do, and in order to do that it must remain in tact.",

I have decided to use it outside only for sweeping away leaves. But inside it just wont sweep worth a damn. I'm gonna include a photo of how it looks now. It's about 8 months old.",

                "reviewText": "I blame myself for not reading more carefully about this broom. The first surprise was when it arrived in a flat rectangular box. I didn\u2019t realize the broom head and handle sections needed to be assembled. Once I had it together I was pleased with the weight and feel of the broom, but as other reviewers have noted, the corn straw head is very stiff. It has loosened up a little, but it\u2019s biggest issue is that the straws break off or fall out while sweeping, so I end up cleaning up broom straws as well as the mess I\u2019m trying to clean up! Pretty dang annoying. Also annoying is having to re-tighten the handle sections while sweeping, as the sweeping action causes them to loosen. I could try gluing the sections together, but I\u2019m not sure I want to keep using the broom anyway.",
