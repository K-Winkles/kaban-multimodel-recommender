                "reviewText": "This is a great quality broom. As funny as I felt ordering a broom online, it was well worth it as there is nothing but plastic or flimsy aluminum junk in stores near me. With 4 kids and 3 dogs our brooms have a tendency to get broken SO fast and I just can't stand throwing away all those plastic handles! I was searching for something more environmentally friendly and came across this. To my pleasant surprise it is very sturdy and has already out-lived all of our old plastic brooms, made it through a move into a new house and shows no signs of stress.It sweeps nicely and the handle is very comfortable and smooth with no rough parts in the wood. A couple of other features I like are that the handle is standard size for a dustpan to snap onto and that there is a sturdy fabric loop at the top of the handle to hang it up for storage.*Update after another year-This broom is STILL functional. Granted, the broom head is in need of a deep clean but that's to be expected with the amount of work this thing does. I use this multiple times daily (most of our house is hard floors) and the only actual damage it has sustained is the top fabric loop being broken off by kids, which was due to carelessness, not a quality issue at all. This broom is awesome!",

                "reviewText": "Ordered in spite of the mixed reviews. It\u2019s perfect for my hardwood floors and tile in my home. I don\u2019t know if some people are expecting it to do miracle work of it being a vacuum and that\u2019s why it has negative reviews or I think that people were being way too critical of the broom itself honestly. It\u2019s a perfectly fine broom. It gets the job done. And I can leave it out because it\u2019s aesthetically pleasing. No you can\u2019t sweep your carpet with it. But you can sweep your hard floors with it as good as you can with a broom that you pick up from Walmart or target. The only thing that I would say about it is a dust pan will scratch the wooden handle so do not put a dust pan attachment onto the broom handle because it will scratch it. I just simply hang up my dustpan next to my broom and it makes it so much easier to grab anyways. Honestly that\u2019s worth a trade off of having an ugly broom sitting around for me personally. I enjoy having aesthetically pleasing things out.",

                "reviewText": "Well the broom came with this little grey silicon piece that was warped and didn't fit in it's groove. So I removed that, since it's not really necessary. And then the handle came off. I used liquid nails on the bamboo stem and attached it back, now it works like a charm. So, with a little bit of work, you can make this beautiful broom work for you. If you want something that works straight out of the box, buy something else. Oh and something else, it says it's got plastic free packaging, but came wrapped in a full four feet a plastic wrapping. I realize that's probably on Amazon, not this seller, but it was pretty ironic.",
