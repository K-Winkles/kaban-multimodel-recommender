                "reviewText": "The brush/squeegee piece works well but the three handle is below par. It bows when using the brush on my low pile area rug, it feels like it will bend/snap. Additionally the handle threading is fine and shallow with a tapered bore so buying a compatible replacement handle locally is a no go. I\u2019ll use it til it breaks but won\u2019t buy another.",
