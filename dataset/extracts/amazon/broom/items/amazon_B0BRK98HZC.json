In my defense, however, this is no ordinary broom. It\u2019s sleek, lightweight, wide, and yet sturdy, all at the same time. It works remarkably well. The bristles are short, but soft - somehow the perfect combo for moving dirt and dust efficiently, leaving behind not even a trace! I\u2019ve never had a broom that I\u2019ve found so easy to use. Gone are the days of pushing/pulling a wide, heavy broom, having to retrace over and over to get everything swept up; what a workout that could be! This broom seems to glide effortlessly. Never knew a broom could even do that! It just arrived this afternoon, and I\u2019ve already ordered another one for a friend. Love it!",

                "reviewText": "I like the bristles, and I like the lightweight yet wide for quick floor sweep, but the three-part pole of this broom does not attach properly, which/ makes the broom inoperable. The only way I could use the broom is if I superglue the 3 parts pole, but it does not guarantee that it will work for long, so I decided to return the product. I would buy again if, in the near future, I see that the manufacturer fixed the flawed design and made this broom work, but for now, I would not recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "Great, light broom that stores easily. Wasn't expecting it to be quite so skinny, but it still does what a broom needs to and fits under furniture well. Bristles pick up a ton, and I think it does a better job than the synthetics I've used, and is better for all of the wood and laminate floors I clean. It's like a Swiffer, but better when you have lots of actual dirt to gather up (like after a rain) and also gathers dog hair quite well. I bought this hybrid because I thought the horse hair brush a client had did a much better job on the floor, but I needed something easier to transport. Overall, would purchase again. The only improvement I would make would be to add another row of bristles, but for the price, I won't complain. Time will tell if the handle will hold up, but I love how light it is, and that the head swivels.",

They do not advertise as such, search in Amazon just picks it up that way. The photos and graphics indicates that this swivels, which it does. Unfortunately it swivels the wrong way for my purposes, parallel with the broom v perpendicular. Great for a regular broom I guess but don\u2019t see how a parallel pivot does any good. Did not try handle just attach\u00e9d to the old one. This is a GREAT broom for near vertical sweeping which is why I am keeping it. Gets fine dust very well and is very ligh and maneuverable.
