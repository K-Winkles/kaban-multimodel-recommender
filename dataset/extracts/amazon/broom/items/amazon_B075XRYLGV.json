They need to improve the length of the product. As of now, this is not worth all the effort we have to put in to use it. Back pain is a major concern here. Normal brooms are longer for a reason, even if they produce dust. When designing the product, they need to take all the points into consideration. I will not recommend this product to anyone. I bought this over a month ago but have not used it more than 3 times.",

However it keeps shedding so many of its strands each time that I have to go around picking up the strands after brooming the house. Also the size is the same as the normal broom. Not very happy with it!!",
