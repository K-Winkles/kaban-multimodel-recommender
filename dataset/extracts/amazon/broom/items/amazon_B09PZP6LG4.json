                "reviewText": "I know it sounds crazy to love a broom, but I do. Sweeping is a breeze now. The soft bristles don't pick up the dust bunnies like my stiff Liberman broom and throw them around causing me to have to chase after them. This wonderful broom gently pushes all the cat litter, cat fur and dust bunnies into a nice little pile that I can sweep into the dustpan and dispose of -- as it should be. Little of it gets stuck to the bristles, which always drove me crazy with other brooms. I no longer have to pull hair and fuzz off the broom bristles when I'm done sweeping. Hallelujah!One tip: This broom requires a different style of sweeping. Don't go sweeping around with broad strokes like a madwoman. The soft bristles will throw debris everywhere. Just take it easy and use a slow hand. Thinking of *pushing* the debris into a pile instead of sweeping it wildly. You'll be impressed.I'm thinking of buying another for when this one wears out, but it seems sturdy enough to last a while. It is definitely long enough for a tall person too. I'm a shorty and I only used two of the three extension pieces when I put the broom together.",
