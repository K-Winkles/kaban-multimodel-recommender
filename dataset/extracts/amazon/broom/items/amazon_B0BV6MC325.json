When cleaning hair from carpets, pull the serrated bristles and the sharp strokes reach deep into the most embedded hairs, bringing the embedded hairs to the carpet surface and collecting them. The serrated bristles easily peel off the collected hairs, saving you time and energy.",
            "\u3010ELECTROSTATIC ADSORPTION\u3011The unique design of this broom combined with the static rubber compound acts like a pet hair magnet. When you brush across the carpet, the bristles of the brush will gain magnetic force and attract the hair to the brush. Clean hairs effectively.",
            "\u3010HANDHELD PET HAIR REMOVER\u3011Handheld rubber brush for easy removal of hair from clothing, car seats and crevices. The rubber bristles are designed to be gentle enough and can also be used on your pet's face to remove debris or work tangles out.",
            "\u3010TELESCOPIC HANDLE\u3011Easily adjust the length of the broom handle to fit any user. The handle can be extended from 36 inches to 60 inches for different heights. It can also be shortened for easy use by children.",
            "\u3010BUILT-IN SQUEEGEE\u3011Built-in waterjet edge helps to clean windows, showers and windshields. Liquid spills on tile, concrete or any hardwood surface can be easily wiped away."

However, if you want to remove hair you need to puts some force into it and that is where the trouble with this broom comes in.This broom twists and supposedly locks when you do so the handle stays long but it does not stay at all. Countless of times while i have used it, it shortens and pinches my hands. That is why I'm rating it 3 stars, just wish it could withstand being used.",
