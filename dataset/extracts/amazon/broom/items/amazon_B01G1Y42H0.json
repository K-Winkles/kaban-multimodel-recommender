They stick to the wall with zero damage to the wall and can hold heavy items. It\u2019s easy to put the handles in and out of the holder and grips them tightly so no slipping or falling. I\u2019ve had some on the wall for a year now with heavy items like a swiffer and have had zero issues. I even use them in my bathroom - I hang my electric scrubbing brush handle up in the corner of my linen closet and the handheld shower head on my shower wall - I wanted something that could be removed and wouldn\u2019t damage the tile but was worried the water and steam would keep it from sticking well. Nope - it\u2019s been up for 9ish months with zero issues. Highly recommend these and will continue to find new uses for them around the house!",

                "reviewText": "I have always been a fan of command products even when each of their products is expensive.I accidentally bought a curtain rod that has 1 1/4 inches in diameter, and it is too thick for the regular command curtain rod holders, so I opted out for broom and mop holders. Surprisingly, they fit the curtain rod perfectly!However, due to the heaviness of my curtain rods, they didn\u2019t hold up well. I had to use small nails to hold top and bottom of the command holders in order for them to stay in place or it would fall down.Other than that, it worked very well. I had them to hang the broom and mop and it\u2019s really good as far as adhesion goes.",
