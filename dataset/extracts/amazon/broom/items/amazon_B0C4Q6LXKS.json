With five of the furry beasts, a dog with flowing tresses, and hundreds of finches who let their little feathers fly everywhere, I am always in quest of a tool that can make it look like we live in a normal household. To that end, I have a Dyson (that seems to weigh 400 pounds), a powerful Bissel, and a Neato who makes a daily sortie through the house.But at the end of the day, someone's fur and feathers are always on the rug.Enter Winco. It is light. It is easy to handle. It is easy to empty. And IT WORKS!Yep. Sweep this across the carpet and remove spectacular amounts of fur and feathers with a minimum of effort.I am in love.I wonder if the state of California allows for Crazy Cat Lady/Winco Floor Sweeper marriages.",

I have two hand woven rugs and I did not want powerful suction on them a vacuum would give so I bought this and it has proved to be exactly what I wanted. It is quite amazing the amount of fluff and dirt it picks up and off hardwood floors also. I sew and machine embroider and it picks up cottons better than a vacuum where these cottons tend to wrap round the brushes and wheels. Not so on this carpet sweeper and It is easy to empty and was a very good choice, Inexpensive a great buy and Amazon delivered in days. Thank you Amazon.",

My husband sleeps late which means that I cannot use the vaccum cleaner when I need to so I decided to give this sweeper a try. It actually works very good for my purposes. Gets up the litter and even a lot of cat hair. I can spot clean areas without scaring the cats and without waking my sleeping spouse. Wish I had purchased it sooner. Also it was a great price!",
