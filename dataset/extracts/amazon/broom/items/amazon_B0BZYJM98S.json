I love the dust pan, just the right height and the teeth on it for helpful removal of dirt and grime. The broom swivels to be able to reach in all areas. It's light and easy to carry around. It works fabulous. I wish I had bought one earlier, it would have saved my back alot of bending!! Love it!!!",

                "reviewText": "It looks exactly like the photos. I have several pros and some cons.The Pros:-The broom has handle extenders for both the broom and dustpan, so bye bye to constantly bending over to sweep debris.-The bending feature allows the broom to bend and twist while you sweep to get those harder to reach crevices easily.-The dustpan easily picks up debris and the bristles keep your broom clean without you having to do the nasty maintenance yourself.-The Broom has sockets to apply tissues or wet wipes for a diy Swiffer type effect to wipe as you sweep (can't believe this wasn't mentioned much!). I love being able to add wipes to it when needed.-The dustpan has a divot on the side that allows you to gather all your trash (That you can see from the clear top!) into one corner and toss it altogether. It makes the entire sweeping process smoother.The Cons:-The bristles are soft and wobbly. They are so soft that it's hard to get a good press onto the ground before you sweep, and they wiggle after every sweep Sometimes that wiggle will toss debris around unintentionally, making you have to go back and resweep small areas.-The broom itself is small. It's not meant for big rooms. More suitable for a kid's room, a bathroom, or a college dorm.-The dustpan is VERY easily dented. try not to tap it against the trash, as it will dent the parts that keep you able to easily sweep trash into it.All in all, if you need a quick broom for quick areas and REALLY like the bristles, this will do wonders. But if you only plan on having one broom in your household, consider a sturdier one.",

The bristles on the brush are so soft and flimsy that it takes forever to get whatever you're sweeping into the dustpan. I literally had to buy another broom to make this functional. If you're looking for a good set don't buy this.",

I ended up takinh one section of the brush off as it was a little too long to use with 1 hand. It's quite versatile in terms of getting in between obstacles, though it does get a little frustrating when the head bends to one side when trying to sweep.I like the window feature of the pan which is handy for seeing how full it is.",
