            "DUSTPAN AND BRUSH SET \u2013 cleaning tools often take up a lot of unnecessary room which is why we have designed a compact solution for sweeping away crumbs, dust and life\u2019s little oopsies. Our blue broom is a necessity to stand-by in in any kitchen cupboard so it\u2019s on hand whenever you need to clean-up quickly",
            "SIZE INFORMATION \u2013 made from plastic with a rubber slanted edge for easy sweeping, our mini dustpan measures 9.88 x 6.3 x 1.42 inches meaning it can be stored in small spaces such as the glove compartment of your car or a drawer in your laundry room",
            "CONVENIENT HANGING HOLE \u2013 we have incorporated a hole into the handle design so the dustpan set can be hung from a hook or peg to keep it stored tidily. The whisk style brush clips snugly into the dustpan make it an ideal cleaning tool for RV\u2019s and motorhomes where space can be at a premium",
            "STIFF BRISTLE DESIGN \u2013 our brush and pan features a stiff style brush, with the brush width the same width as the pan. This means you can sweep larger piles of dirt straight into the pan without having to repeatedly sweep the same area. The handheld design means you can target many areas, even higher surfaces such as kitchen work surfaces and tables",
            "MULTIPURPOSE NESTING DUSTPAN SET \u2013 so many customers love the versatility of our dustpan set, they use it for a manner of tasks including cleaning out pet cages, clearing up kitty litter and sweeping up dirt that their pets bring into the home. Campers love to use it to keep their tents and RV\u2019s clean and crafters find it incredibly useful for sweeping up glitter, beads and other small items"
        ],
        "description": "Easy to keep clean Sometimes we forget that our cleaning tools need cleaning which is why we have made it easy for you to keep our dustpan set clean as a whistle. Just use soap and water whenever needed to leave your brush and pan set looking good and ready for the next job. Multipack options We recommend assigning a dustpan and brush set to one particular task. For example, use one set for cleaning out rabbit and guinea pig cages but use a different set for sweeping crumbs off the dining table and kitchen surfaces. We have made it affordable to do this by creating multipacks so you can save when buying more than one dustpan set. Easy and compact Large dustpan and brushes with long handles and shovel like dust collectors can be big and bulky and not always practical for smell messes and dirt piles. Using our compact nesting version is quick and easy and when finished you can put it away with zero effort. Designed to fit in a glovebox, closet, drawer or hung from a peg it is a must have for any home when a quick tidy up is required. BUY NOW and enjoy the convenience and practicality of our dustpan and brush set for your home or vehicle",
