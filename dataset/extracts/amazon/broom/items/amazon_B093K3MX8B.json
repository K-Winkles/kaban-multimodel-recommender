                "reviewText": "Pro: First time I've purchased a no bending necessary type of dustpan with teeth and I like it! Broom works on smooth floors and/or carpet and dustpan sweeps easily over the rubber edge. I'm 5' 4\" and used 2 of the extended poles for the broom, but may add the 3rd pole section after I get used to it. It fit into my clothes closet just fine that has 3 sliding panels and didn't catch on anything.I also love the light sky blue color. I don't try to dump it into my trashcan as it's a lot simpler to use one of the many Amazon boxes to carry any fallen leaves to the recycle bin out in the back parking lot area.Con: I don't see how anyone would be able to 'hang' either one of these up on a shop wall since the holes in the top handle don't line up at all and you would need some kind of super long screwing nail. That's not an option for me since I rent a small senior apartment and they frown on that one. I'm happy it fits in my closet with the broom hanging from the attached clip on the dustbin pole. Note: It's NOT a snap on handle, folks! Just lift the broom ABOVE the first black pole extension and allow it to slide gently downward until it rests above the black part and it will stay on just fine. Removes just as easily as it goes on in reverse.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this is a fairly solid broom, and I mean that literally and figuratively. The handle has a good heft, but it doesn't feel heavy, and it's well made. The soft bristles make sweeping easier. The handle on the dustpan is equally well-made.However, a few things keep it from its best potential. For starters, the broom handle is too long. While it's great for sweeping by itself, this type of broom/dustpan set is supposed to be used at the same time, but the longer handle of the broom makes that difficult.Next, the dustpan hinge is very stiff. When you see custodians using commercial versions of these things, they pick up the dustpan, and it folds up, preventing junk from falling out while you move to something else to sweep. This dustpan you have to force up, which isn't easy to do. Along with that, it's also harder to dump in a trash can. Now that could be partly because my can is a weird semicircle shape, but even if it wasn't, I still can't imagine emptying the bin being easier.My dog sheds a lot and has thick fur. The fur loves clinging to the bristles because of static electricity. Enter the bristle comb on the dustpan: its teeth are too wide for the bristles.The dustpan has a clip in it the broom should connect to, except it doesn't because the handle of the broom is too narrow and the pieces that connect the handle pieces together are too wide.",
