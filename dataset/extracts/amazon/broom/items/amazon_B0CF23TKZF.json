This one though had strong connections and maintains it stability the entire time I use it. Another nice feature of this broom was the hand grip which fit perfectly for me and helped make sweeping up pet hair a breeze. I am keeping this broom up off the ground as one of our previous ones from a different manufacturer had the bristles stay bent and out of shape after resting on the ground for too long. I'm aiming to prevent the possibility of that with this broom as I really like its ergonomics.",

                "reviewText": "This will get quite a bit of hair off your low pile rugs, but it won't get it all. I'd recommend vacuuming first, then going over with this broom. For the price, I am not complaining, and I have used it multiple times, but I do think the same result could be received with a good vacuum, which I do have. Can also be used on furniture where maybe your vacuum can't reach. Overall, a very handy tool if you have pets that shed.",

                "reviewText": "Our place is largely tile and wood. As such we rely a lot on area rugs.While we clean them regularly, many of them aren't easy to vacuum due to their size and the suction on the vacuum trying to pick them up.have tried the rake kind of floor brushes before and while they do work in thew few rooms we have with carpet (which we can vacuum) they don't do as well on the rugs that don't have as much pile to them and which also get dragged along.Using this like a rake, pulling it to me, I pulled up an alarmingly huge bunch of cat hair from a rug our cat regularly sits and rolls around on. This is in a fairly high traffic area and I honestly couldn't believe how much came up from a 3x4 rug with just a few times going through the motions.As others have mentioned, it seems to have a little less functionality (at least dry) when working directly on the hard floors but the ability to attach a towel to the top does give it some nice possibilities as a mop but with scrubbing action on the bristles and then finishing/drying with a dish towel.It comes in several pieces in a pretty nondescript box and produces something that feels sturdy and has a padded spot for where your second hand would hold to push against a surface for leverage which was a nice touch.It's telescoping to a degree. This doesn't add a ton of length but for using it on the floor, at over 6', I found it to be plenty adequate.Overall, I'm very happy with this and compared to what else is out there, at $16, it really feels like a steal.",
