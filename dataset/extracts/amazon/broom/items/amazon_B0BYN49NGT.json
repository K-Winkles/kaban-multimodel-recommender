I enjoy how the dust pan handle is long and convinient when picking up the dirt pile from the floor eliminating the need of bending over after sweeping the floor. The detangling brush on the dust pan makes it convinient to clean the broom's brush from any dust, hair, and anything that tends to tangle when sweeping and eliminating the use of my hand to clear it. It's compact and doesnt take a lot of space when putting away in a closet. I even had to buy a second one to prevent my mother from taking mine.",

                "reviewText": "Works great when you live with 2 cats. I keep this in the litterbox area to catch and loose litter and fluffs of hair. I love the comb for scraping the broom clean with every sweep. Plus It\u2019s easy to empty: the base can stay locked at 90 degrees so you can turn it sideways to pour. But it can also lay flush which helps for hanging storage. It\u2019s nice to clip the broom right onto the handle so the 2 pieces can stay together.",

If it were any smaller I would be able to sweep my truck out. Lol. I will keep it because my old broom is outside in the snow. So it's wet and gross. But I think if you are looking to clean your kitchen you might want one a little bigger. Also my fault for not checking the size. Just assumed it would be a regular broom size.Thank youKathy hall",
