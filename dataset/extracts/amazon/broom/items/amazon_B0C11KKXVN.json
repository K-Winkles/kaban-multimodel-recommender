Besides, using a big and bulky hoover can be a bit bothersome, especially if you only need to clean a small portion of the floor. That said, how do you keep your floors clean in between vacuuming schedules? This is where a broom comes in handy. But you don't want to use just any other broom.

This rubber broom and squeegee is perfect for cleaning up different types of dirt and debris. This includes spilled beverages, loose soil, broken glasses, as well as dust and pollen on windows.

The long shaft and thin broom head allow you to clean hard-to-reach areas like underneath the couch or cornice. The head's sharp corners also allow you to effectively sweep the wall-floor joints. We also designed and crafted this broom for a long service life. The stainless steel pole stands well against rust, and the silicone/TPE head won't easily deform or become flimsy.
