In sweeping up a hardwood floor, this broom did a much better job than a regular broom in terms of not missing small pieces and with cat hair. With a normal broom, cat hair floats away, but with this broom, the cat hair was much more manageable and tended to stay in the swept up pile.The squeegee is a super nice feature as well. It is great for spills. With the rubber components, leaning this tool will be easy and it should dry quickly.My only complaint is that the handle is a little short. I am a little shorter than average and found that a longer handle would be helpful. The handle comes in three segments that are screwed together. Another two inches on each segment length would be better.Overall, I am happy with this broom and expect that it will completely replace my standard brooms.",

No. I should have just paid the extra $10 and got a better one. This one is really short. I'm 5'6\" and it was hell on my back. The pole feels really don't like it's going to bend at any moment. The rubber part keeps popping out of the bottom so every few \"sweeps\" I have to put it back in, so does the top of the handle that has the hole for hanging.

I was looking for a broom with a larger broom head with soft and elastic bristles (the original replacement I bought is too narrow and its bristles are too stiff), and this one delivers. It doesn't scratch the floors, picks up hair and dust well, and seems wide enough to help with general household chores (it won't get into every corner, but I wasn't looking for that). The \"squeegee\" side of the brush head seems sturdy and able to deal with water. The drawback: the broom's handle is really flimsy, will likely bend out of shape easily. And for a tall person (I am 5'10\"), it is definitely way too short, a good 10 inches more would be much more useful.",

                "reviewText": "Several years ago I purchased my first rubber broom and was amazed at the difference in using this style broom. Unfortunately, after purchasing several more as gifts the company quit making it. I tried another version but it was not near as good. When I found this one I hoped it would at least compare to my first rubber broom and indeed it does. The handle is not painted, thus no issue of paint pealing like the original one I had. The head of the broom is thicker and that is a wonderful change to pick up more of the tiny particles of dirt and grass that gets tracked in from the yard. This broom is not as tall as my others, but that is not a negative and makes storage easier. If you have never tried a rubber broom, I would strongly recommend this one.",

                "reviewText": "We use this in my salon for getting hair off entrance rugs when the vacuum can\u2019t be used. It works wonderfully on hair on solid floors or brushing it off the carpet rugs.I appreciate the squeegee on the back side. We have had to use one after a water leak, and it worked amazingly at scooting the water where we needed it to go for cleanup.This broom has plastic pincher things (not sure what they\u2019re called) where you can secure a towel on the end and use it as a mop (just like a Swiffer works).The handle is long and could be used comfortably by someone over 6\u2019 tall. It is not the thickest aluminum, but it will work fine. If it ever breaks, the female end is universal, so you can just twist on your own broom handle from another broom/mop if it breaks or if you prefer a different kind.This is a solid choice for a broom where a vacuum isn\u2019t practical. Hope this helps!",
