He was always asking me to give him my full size broom to sweep so I saw this one and couldn't resist it! Very easy to put together and I loved the white and gray. It is lightweight and feels strong enough to last for years or through several small ones. Super cute and perfect size for any child. I even use the dustpan with a handle for myself instead of getting down on the floor to hold mine. Very cute!",
