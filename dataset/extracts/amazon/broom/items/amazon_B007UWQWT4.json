                "reviewText": "DESCRIPTION> This is a \"Janitor's Broom\" meaning that it is a little larger than a typical household broom. Ordinary household brooms were designed 100 years ago for your 5' tall grandmother or great-grandmother. This is a \"man's\" (e.g., janitor's) broom, scaled up for a 6' tall man (or a tall strong woman, of course).> Specifically, it is 56\" tall. The handle is 1+\" in diameter. The bristle end is 11+\" wide at the bottom. Note that, it really isn't as large as that may sound. If I hadn't actually measured, I would have guessed the handle to be 7/8 inch in diameter and the bristles to reach 10 inches; wide.> Wooden handle, natural bristles.> The broom I received had a natural-colored handle (not black), with white (not black) stitching.> Greenish tinge to the bristles\u2013probably an anti-fungal treatmentEVALUATION> Well constructed, but designed to be functional, not \u201cpretty\u201d.> Works great. It does what a broom is supposed to do.> Easier on the hands (except maybe for individuals with child-size hands) for heavy sweeping, for example, of a garage, patio, or otherwise a large area, than a standard household broom.> A little heavier and less maneuverable than a standard household broom, but the longer handle has better leverage -- which means that the actual sweeping motion is less strain (at least for individuals over, say 5 1/2' tall).> Works fine for household sweeping, but I still choose my much smaller, lighter, metal-handle synthetic-bristle broom (with a long-handled dust pan) to sweep up small areas.> Click on \u201cStoney\u201d just below the product title to see my other reviews.
