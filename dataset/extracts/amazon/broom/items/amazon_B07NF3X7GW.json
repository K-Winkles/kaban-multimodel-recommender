Non-stick cellophane, or zip-tie, any other method than wrapping them several times around with thick packaging tape. They were hard to cut apart (wrapped tightly together), hard to get the tape off of the handles. Had to use a lot of goo-gone and elbow grease to get all the sticky off. But again, broom quality is excellent!",
