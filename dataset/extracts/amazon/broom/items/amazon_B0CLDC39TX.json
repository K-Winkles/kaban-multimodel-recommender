                "reviewText": "The assembly takes some muscle, especially mounting the handle to the brush itself. I applied quite a lot of force to get it to mate and to tighten the threads. But the broom held up, strong enough to take it. The bristles are plastic and are firmly rooted - could not pull any out by hand. The head is 16 inches wide, wider than the 14 inch of my pushbroom (and much wider than 'regular' brooms I have, 10 inch). The angle of the head is just right for me (not quite 6 ft tall) and works well with the long handle. It says 'outdoor' use; it should be fine for that; I wanted it for use in the shop and it's great for that, easier to maneuver than a push broom and 'grips' wood dust/chips nicely. Due to angle of head, it does not stand up easily - I stand it upside down. There is a loop at the top of the handle, plenty big, so I hang it when I'm near a hanger (nail). The loop swivels nicely, so you can hang it easily at an angle. Handle is steel tubing, pretty good thickness, reasonable sturdy. Broom head is plastic but again pretty sturdy. I expect this will last quite a while and it works well for my purposes.",

                "reviewText": "Update: Seller reached out with detailed instructions. The longer thread piece needs to go in the broom head and the rest of the pieces thread in correctly. Good size broom and I'm happy that it did not go to waste. With all the pieces threaded in, it has a comfortable length for sweeping in without much effort.Recommend.------ Previous reviewBroom bristles are sturdy and soft. Good amount of sweep. All the goodness is wasted with a wrong sized thread on the multi-piece handle. See pictures with markings. One of the threads is not tapered. Because of this, the last piece of the handle with the plastic cover cannot be screwed in.------",
