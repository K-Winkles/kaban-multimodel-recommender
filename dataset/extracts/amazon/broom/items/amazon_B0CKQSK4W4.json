He doesn\u2019t want to sweep with anything else but this\u2026and he likes to get it out and use it! The cool thing about this one also is that you can use it on carpets and rugs and it picks up dog hair like a champ. I can\u2019t remember the last time we used an actual broom. These are the best! I don\u2019t use the handle attachment much but I\u2019m sure it is good as well.",

                "reviewText": "Glad I made this purchase. The rubber broom really comes in handy for a quick pick up of hair off the carpet when you don't have to or have time to vacuum. Plus, it saves your vacuum from all that tangled hair! We have three people in the house with long hair and no matter how hard you try hair gets on the floors and carpet. We have two small non-shedding dogs and our main concern was for them when hair would get stuck on their toys. This product gives me piece of mind that I can pick up the hair so there's less risk to my dogs. The handle could be a little more stable, so that's why I didn't give five stars, but it fits together (not one long piece) so that's probably why.",

                "reviewText": "I love that it cleans all the pet hair from my floors. However, the pieces of the stick that twist into each other are not durable. They come loose often and after 3 times of tightening them, it became washed and just keeps twisting, making this now useless after 2 uses. Maybe better stick/handle would make this a better overall product because the rubber broom part is amazing, but I am not about to get on the floor with the short piece of the broom.",

I squeegee the floor before I mop and THIS THING GETS ALL THE HAIR UP!!! It\u2019s amazing!!! I love this thing it\u2019s such a staple to my cleaning routine!! I will say the handle is coming loose tho maybe the handle could have been made with a stronger type of metal!!",
