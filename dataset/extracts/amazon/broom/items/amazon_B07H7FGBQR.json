                "reviewText": "We recently purchased a Ventis HEI240 fireplace insert and we love it. But my open fireplace tools are just too big to do a good cleanout. So I ordered this dustpan and brush to work inside the insert. It's working out better than I had expected, the dustpan fits in there nicely and it's easy to scoop up piles of ash. Once I get the bulk of ashes scooped out I can use the brush to move the remaining ash to the center and scoop it out. I'm getting about 95% of all the ash out by using this dustpan and brush. I then use my shop vac with a filter bag installed to vacuum out the remaining ash. With the filter bag in my shop vac I get absolutely no ash dust into the room. It all works great!",

                "reviewText": "As others have said, it is quite small, but built of sturdy materials and well constructed. I would imagine if not abused it could easily last a lifetime. I agree with the review that said it was not stainless steel but rather it is nicely coated mild steel. I believe it will be absolutely perfect as a counterbrush to clean the stray flower and seeds and crumbs from the food contact surfaces in the kitchen and from the table linens on the dining table. I'm going to use it for just that so that it stays sanitary. Although, technically it would have to be made in Japan to be a Shuro broom and this one is clearly marked made in China, it is absolutely a quality product. The very same big palms and windmill palms that have been used for centuries are native to both China and Japan. I'm sure the broom bristles are authentic; they are very fine and don't create any static electricity so it's extremely well suited for sweeping and collecting extremely fine dust like pastry flour. I couldn't be happier with this product.",

So far, it's holding. But this was purchased to be used, not as a decorative item, and I hang a lot of things because I have limited space. I guess it was too heavy for the glue, or whatever. Oh, yeah. One of the main reasons I chose THIS broom and dustpan was the lack of icky plastic parts.",
