                "reviewText": "This brush is equipped with stiff bristles made of resilient plastic, making it highly effective in removing stubborn stains from the ground. Not only that, but these bristles are also sturdy and durable, helping to ensure that they won't wear down the ground.This scrub brush features a strong stainless long handle. With three stainless steel rods that can be assembled up to a maximum of 118 cm, this brush is both strong and rust-proof. I found it easy to push without any stopping or bending, even when faced with heavy-duty dirt. The threaded joints with locking also ensure that the rods stay securely tightened, so there's no need to worry about any loosening.It can be used for both wet and dry cleaning, making it suitable for a wide range of surfaces. Whether it's tile floors, hardwood floors, glass surfaces, or cement floors like tubs, bathrooms, kitchens, showers, walls, garages, and patios, this brush gets the job done effortlessly.The humanized design of this scrub brush is another aspect that I appreciate. The 45-degree angled floor scrub brush head allows me to easily reach corners and cracks without having to bend or kneel down. This not only saves me time and effort but also reduces the strain on my knees and back while doing housework. Additionally, the piece of sponge wrapped around the pole adds a soft and hands-free touch, which is especially helpful during the colder months.Maintaining this brush isn't complex. After each use, I simply wash it with clean water and hang it up using the conveniently included wall mount. The push boom even comes with a hook for easy cleaning and storage, making it user-friendly to keep this brush in top-notch condition.I'd recommend the Izsohhome Deck Scrub Brush. Its stiff bristles, strong stainless long handle, versatility, and humanized design make it a fantastic tool for any cleaning task. Not to mention, its easy maintenance adds to its appeal. If you're in need of a reliable and durable scrub brush, look no further than this one.",
