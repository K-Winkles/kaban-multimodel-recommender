I am pleased with it. It fit the standard size broom handle I already had just fine. It works well. The bristles are stiff enough to handle outside dirt and debris, but are not too stiff. I love the color of it because it makes it easy to spot in the garage when it is mixed in with the other lawn tools and because I like colorful household things. I would definitely recommend it.",

The current broom reached the end of life, as one can see in the pictures. It was time to get a new one, and this offering doesn't force you to get a new handle.I can see how useful this broom will be in any shop, work area. The construction is good, the bristles are strong, but yet bendable, there are enough of them to clean a floor well. The angled design allows one to reach hard to reach areas, and we like it. Good value for money. I can see how people who need more of them will get the different colors, making sure that broom is used only in that area.",

                "reviewText": "The construction of this SPARTA 36867EC05 Plastic Angled, Broom Head is super strong and rugged. The plastic is thick and durable. The bristles are large and frayed at the ends to catch smaller particles and dust.My old broom finally wore out. This broom head fit my old standard threaded broom stick perfectly. I was happy to re-use the broom stick and to be able to just replace the broom head.I am using this broom in my workshop and garage and it is perfect.I think this broom would also be great in any commercial, industrial or residential application.This is a great broom head that will last for many years.I highly recommended.",
