Yet, its performance has completely won me over, especially because it leaves behind no trace of dirt or pet hair.Quality:This broom is surprisingly robust, withstanding regular use without losing its edge. The squeegee does an excellent job, unlike traditional brooms that often miss fine particles.Water Resistance:Unlike bristle brooms that get soggy, this broom works well even when wet, retaining its shape and cleaning power.Sturdiness:I was pleasantly surprised by how strong this broom is. It\u2019s built to withstand heavy use without bending or breaking.Ease of Use:What's most impressive is how effortlessly it maneuvers into hard-to-reach places, thanks to its swiveling head. The ease of cleaning around obstacles without leaving anything behind, not even pet hair, is a significant upgrade.Ending Thoughts:This broom room has thoroughly debunked my initial skepticism. Its ability to pick up every last bit of dirt and hair, paired with its durability and ease of use, makes it a top-notch choice for any household. It's nice to finally find a cleaning tool that actually does what it promises, leaving floors spotless.",

                "reviewText": "I have a bit of bad luck when it comes to purchasing squeegees. It seems you typically buy the head and the handle separately, and they never stay together. Yeah, I really don't want to deal with the squeegee head falling off on the middle of a chore anymore. My neighbors hear me curse enough the way it is.This product works quite well for what I need it for. I have a back patio where water accumulates every time it rains or every time I water the lawn. If I don't clean it up, it gets kind of gross after a while. I use the squeegee to keep the patio clean, and it's about a 3 minute job with this squeegee.With the old fall-apart squeegees, it was about a 6 minute job.So I will say that this is a huge improvement, but with regular use, I don't anticipate it will last more than a year or so, and that's why I've marked it four stars.My personal opinion is that this is the perfect squeegee for places that don't have shower stalls. If you're bathroom has a shower but no stall, you'd typically need a squeegee to clean the floor after using the shower. I think that is likely what this squeegee is perfect for, as it is the perfect size for a task like that.If you need it to clean a larger area, though, the head could be a tad larger.",

It\u2019s incredible at picking up all the cat hair in hard to reach places and it\u2019s incredibly lightweight to handle and slim to store. Just do your floors a favor and buy it.",

The thick blade won't get in the baseboard/wall joint.It does do a good job on the straightaway and doesn't hold on to dog hair. I will continue to use it, but will not reorder. I expect it to have a short life because of how malleable it is.",
