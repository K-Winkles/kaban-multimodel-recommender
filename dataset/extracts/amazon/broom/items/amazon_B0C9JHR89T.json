                "reviewText": "I was drawn to this broom because of the angled bristles, making it easy to use in corners. It was easy to assemble, with four pieces in the handle, with a cushion near the grip.With other brooms I've found the cushioning deteriorates over time and there is nothing special about this cushion to suggest otherwise. But the pieces of the handle all screw together tightly and where the lowest piece meets the broom itself, the connection appears firm. That is an area where nearly every broom I've had has literally fallen apart.I have already used the broom in several areas: my laminate floor kitchen, my concrete walkway and porch, and my wooden deck. It swept up debris efficiently without the need to go back and forth multiple times. And the angled broom did well getting into the corners. The bristles moved smoothly and I did not see any loose ones after sweeping.The broom came unassembled in its own box, with all parts included and none damaged or scratched. The only other item was a single sheet with a drawing of the steps for assembly. Putting it together is intuitive, and I wish the manufacturer had taken the time to add information on the company, such as customer contact numbers. However, it did not provide anything else.I do like the quality of this broom and hope it continues to perform well for at least a few years.",

                "reviewText": "Really happy with this broom. We had a big cemented backyard that gets a little messy with all the neighboring plants hanging over the fence. After raking up the bigger items, this really helped clean up the debris left behind. We also cleaned it then used it in the garage. It's nice to be able to take it apart as well as there really isn't a convenient spot to store it in the house and I'd rather not leave it outside.The cushioned handles makes using this for long periods of time less difficult.",
