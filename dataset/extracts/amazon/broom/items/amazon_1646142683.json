                "reviewText": "It's 1930s Mississippi. Magic is permitted only in certain circumstances, and by certain people. Unsanctioned broom racing is banned. But for those who need the money, or the thrills...it's there to be found. Billie Mae, Loretta, Cheng-Kwan, Mattie, Emma, and Luella will all work together as a family - biological and chosen - to find freedom, agency, safety, and love in a world that not only denies them freedom but actively persecutes them.This is a book that stays with you long after you read it. Though it\u2019s a graphic novel, it\u2019s not a quick read - every page has such deep illustrations and rhetoric that it is best read slowly, with contemplation. The characters are incredibly strong, even when afraid, and it is magical to watch them love and support each other. While so many at that period in history did not get a happy ending - and still don\u2019t today - the book ends in a wonderfully satisfying way.Whether you\u2019ve never read a graphic novel, or have and love them, this is a book worth reading that anyone can find joy and meaning in, as well as learn from.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely loved this! The historical setting in Depression era Mississippi combined with the fantasy world building of magic and broom racing is so well done. The main characters are all from marginalized communities and are faced with period typical racism and racist laws. In this story, Black people aren't allowed to learn or practice magic, and Indigenous children are often taken to residential schools if their families can't pay to exempt them. In this time of scarcity and danger, this band of young women and girls compete in dangerous broom races to win prize money that will get them closer to securing safer futures for them all. The story is compelling, and I love the glimpses of backstory that reveal the early friendships between Bille Mae, Luella, Loretta, and Cheng Kwan. I especially liked how the girls learn that Cheng Kwan is trans and immediately accept her and welcome her into their friend group. The art is so good! I've been a fan of Teo DuVall's work for years, and I thoroughly enjoyed gazing upon their artwork in Brooms. The character designs are really cool; I like that there's a wide variety of body types, ages, skin tones, etc.. There's also disability rep with multiple characters, all of which is portrayed with care. I was really impressed by how this story skillfully shows these characters in all their complexities, and tells an exciting tale of magic, risk, and new beginnings. A must read!",
