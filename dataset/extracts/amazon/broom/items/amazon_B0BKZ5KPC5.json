                "reviewText": "I have three animals and when the weather is bad and they can't get out, they use a doggie/cat door to go into the garage to do their business. We are constantly cleaning up and I wanted this stiff broom to make scrubbing the floor after cleaning up the mess easier. This broom is so handy and we can push water and soap around, and rinse water. It also took a bucket of bleach and soap, and then the cleaning after we rinsed the floor. Made this job so much easier. I prefer not having to walk them in bad weather, and they wouldn't go anyway. So, using the garage has been great. The cat has her litter box out there...the dogs soon followed the cat outside and have pads and an area for their \"business.\" They miss the pads a lot of the time. But, there's nothing in the house in our living space. Now the garage floor can really be scrubbed clean when they miss the pads. This brush really adds to the ease of cleaning up with it's bristles and ability to scrub the floor. The other broom brush we had was pitiful and not stiff enough to really scrub. We scrubbed the patio and even the deck with it (of course, we clean the brushes with a bleach mixture between jobs).",

                "reviewText": "The bristles are strong and hold well, don\u2019t rip out or bend easy. However, the handle does bend easy, the endcap pops off, and once it starts bending it doesn\u2019t telescope anymore. I weigh 135 pounds and bent it after a couple uses, and now I can\u2019t extend or contract it. Had to buy a new broom handle",
