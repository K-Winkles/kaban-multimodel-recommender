                "reviewText": "This is a purchase I\u2019d been meaning to make for a while\u2014upgraded from a standard mop with disposable wet pads to this one that sprays and goes, and it\u2019s washable!Pros:-you only need to use one pad & it has strong Velcro to keep the pad in place-completely saturates textured tiles whereas with my old mop I couldn\u2019t get in the groves without pushing hard on the mop-effortless spray and push-ease to put together and maintain-swivels with ease and gets under furniture easily-Holds enough cleaner to cover my whole house (kitchen, laundry room, hallways, and 2 bathrooms)\u2014I still has some leftover afterward, too-picks up typical floor stains with ease-leak-free-saves money on buying disposable pads; only have to buy bulk cleaner now-cuts mopping time in halfCons:-the handle/pole is sensitive to applied pressure, so definitely don\u2019t feel like you need to put elbow grease into it\u2014you don\u2019t-cleaner container seems a bit flimsy but will see how it holds up with time-can\u2019t set the cleaner container on the counter top to pour in the cleaner (a problem for those with coordination issues or another physical disability); I recommend the company change it from a rounded to a flat edge on bottom when it is flipped upside down to be filled-you need to remember to wash the pad if you\u2019re a bit forgetful like I am, but I\u2019ll just add it to my towel wash routine so I don\u2019t forget-the blue mop is a tad on the short side, so if you\u2019re taller than 5\u20195\u201d, you\u2019ll probably find it a bit uncomfortable; however, I noticed they also offer an extra long red mop-has a slight learning curve in terms of angling the sprayer (don\u2019t spray it near your pet bowls or low lying plants)Overall, I had a pleasant experience using the blue mop for the first time. I\u2019m partial to the ruffled, more traditional pad, but I have no doubt the other two microfiber pads work just as well. My last word of advice: if you struggle with executive functioning and/or arthritis, this is the mop for you. This was a great purchase!",

At first I was a bit skeptical because it seemed so flimsy out of the box but I have used this for a few months now and I am completely satisfied. I have laminate and vinyl in my house and cleaning it is now a breeze. The mop is lightweight and easy to use. The sprayer lays down just the right amount of cleaner (slight learning curve on directing the spray) and the best part is I control the type of cleaner that I use and the mop heads are machine or hand washable! No need to press down hard on this mop and I really wouldn't want to as the handle is a bit on the weak side but works perfect for me!",

I never used a swiffer so I'm not sure how those compare. but I definitely prefer a good old mop and bucket.",

I love the mop heads, that with adding just a little pressure, can wipe off stains on the floor. I also love that the mop heads machine wash so easily and come out just about like new. There are two mop heads included, and I ordered three extra, thinking I would need them, but after some ordinary floor cleaning and a lot of cleaning up after my elderly dog with dementia, I am still on my first one that has had just one machine wash so far. I also love that it cost so mush less than the one advertised everywhere. I also love that I can use any cleaner that I want in the product.",
