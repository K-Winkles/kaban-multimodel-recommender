It also helps getting hair off the tile floors.I haven't had any issues with the pole.I highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I love using this broom because it picks up a ton of stuff, but the freaking pole is awful! It is constantly coming undone at the height adjustment area even though I lock it, and it comes undone from the broom head too. Since I want to be able to take the broom head off to wash it, I don't really want to superglue it, and at the area where you can adjust the height, there's no easy way to superglue it even if I wanted to. I did superglue the hanging end and the two grippy things that you put a microfiber cloth on to mop with (yes, those plastic pieces fell out too when I tried to use them the first time).Besides the horrible pole issues that drive me absolutely bonkers, this broom works incredibly well. I have lots of pets and this picks up fur from my hardwood floors like no one's business. Putting the microfiber cloth on it to damp mop works great too. It works on the low pile throw rug I have in my living room as well to pull out the absolutely shocking amount of fur my animals deposit on it on a daily basis. But the best part of this entire purchase for me is the little mini lint remover brush that came with the broom! My pets adore being brushed with it. Even my Siamese, who hates all brushes loves the little rubber brush that came with this. My dog goes into zen mode when I brush him out. I will be a lifer ordering these brushes for the pets. A+Would I recommend this? Yes, I would. You have to know that you will have to keep tightening some of the joints with the handle, but it really is an effective tool in my furry house. It's worth the bother imo, and the lint remover is an extra perk that I, and my pets, are really happy about!",
