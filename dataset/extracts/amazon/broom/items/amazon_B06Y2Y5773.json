I would have given it 5 stars, the only issue is the height. The broom is not extendable like the swiffer-like mop so it will only have a limited life. Thankfully it\u2019s perfect right now for my 3 yr old who is average height but I expect he will soon grow too tall to comfortably use this item. The swiffer has a bit more extendability which will give it a longer life. Both items are adorable - cute colors and fully functional items for your little one to clean with you!",

Other than that the polls were not as sturdy as I would like it as the duster handle didn\u2019t stay all the way extended but kept falling back into itself so I don\u2019t know if it was broken the broom and dust pan are really cute but again the handles are not made very well the bristles on the broom serve the purpose for a seven-year-old. but don\u2019t expect to have it sweep up heavier items the dust pan doesn\u2019t pick up everything as it goes right underneath the pan making it difficult to pick up what little that was already swept. Great for teen room or dorm but won\u2019t last",
