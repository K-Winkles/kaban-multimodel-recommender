As someone who takes pride in maintaining a clean and tidy living space, I am always on the lookout for reliable cleaning tools, and this duo definitely exceeded my expectations.Firstly, let's talk about the broom. It is crafted with high-quality materials, ensuring durability and longevity. The bristles are firm yet gentle on all types of surfaces, effectively sweeping away even the tiniest dust particles with ease. The broom's design is lightweight, allowing for effortless maneuverability around furniture and other obstacles. Additionally, the adjustable handle is a great feature, as it caters to users of different heights, providing a comfortable and ergonomic grip.Now, let's move on to the accompanying dust pan. This dust pan doesn't disappoint either. Its wide opening ensures that no debris gets left behind, saving me from the frustration of having to repeatedly sweep up the same area. The integrated rubber lip creates a tight seal against the floor, preventing any dust or dirt from escaping, which is a huge relief. The dust pan also has a convenient clip for attaching the broom, making storage a breeze and ensuring that these two tools are never separated.Together, this broom and dust pan set has made my cleaning routine so much more efficient and enjoyable. In just a few swipes, it successfully clears my floors of all dirt and dust, giving my home a fresh and sparkling appearance. Whether I'm sweeping hardwood floors, tiles, or carpets, this dynamic duo effortlessly gets the job done.Apart from their exceptional cleaning performance, both the broom and dust pan are incredibly easy to clean. A quick rinse under running water and they look as good as new every time!If you're in the market for a broom and dust pan set that offers superb functionality, durability, and convenience, I highly recommend this Amazon purchase. Trust me; you won't be disappointed.",

I went to my son's house and saw that he had this broom and dustpan. I instantly knew I had to have one. As soon as I returned home I order it from Amazon. This is so simple and is more than FANTASTIC. No more bending over to get the dirt into the pan. Simply scoop it in and then into the trash can. My daughter saw it during a visit and wanted one too. She has had several surgeries and cannot use the old broom and dustpan method. So, Santa got her one for Christmas. She cannot thank me enough. Whomever invented this needs a medal.",

                "reviewText": "After my 2-star review, the company reached out to me and offered to send me their new version. It arrived today and I have to say it is VASTLY improved over the original version.The broom actually sweeps instead of just flicking debris all over the floor. The dustpan actually sits closer to the floor and I can sweep dust, sand, even pet hair into the bin instead of under it. THIS is why I ordered the product and this version delivers. One feature that I especially love is the comb on the dustpan. It's great at getting the pet hair out of the broom without having to touch it.I appreciate the company's willingness to listen to complaints and act upon them. Vast improvement and very attentive to customer concerns. Almost unheard of these days. I can now recommend this product as all my issues have been satisfactorily addressed.My previous review:The broom that comes with this is absolutely worthless. The bristles are too stiff to actually do any good. I'll use it to knock down the wasp nests on my deck or the spider webs that seem to always show up on my front porch banister, but for sweeping the floors, it's a no-go.The bin is ok. It works well with my old broom--even though I was hoping to replace it thus the reason for purchasing this one. I do have to tilt it to get the dirt/sand/pet hair (the joys of living near the coast with a shedding dog) to actually go into the bin instead of under it. Which means I'm still trying to sweep the debris with one hand while holding the dust bin with the other. I only managed to eliminate the need to bend over or squat (I can't do either easily due to back/knee issues) when using a dust bin.I'll keep it, but I will most likely relegate it to use in the garage or maybe for picking up dog poop in the yard. For indoor use, it really isn't that great. Good thing it was cheap.",

                "reviewText": "Love this set. It was easy to put together. And it's easy to use. What I really like about the broom is that the bristles are firm. I have dogs and I have a lot of dog fur in my house. Only the bedrooms have carpet but when I try to vacuum the vacuum doesn't always pick up the fur. I use this broom and it's firm enough to sweep up the fur from the carpet. Love it it's perfect. Also a vacuum doesn't get right up against the edge of a wall and this broom does. It's got a really long handle so it's suitable for people who are tall. I am not tall but I can tell that it would be good for somebody who is tall. And I love the feature where the teeth grab the stuff off of the broom and put it into the dustpan. This is a perfect set. Highly recommend..",

My only complaint is that the broom is pretty weak. I have kids and have to sweep a few times a day and it didn't really do the job for me. I ended up taking my old broom and adding it to dust pan to use regularly.",
