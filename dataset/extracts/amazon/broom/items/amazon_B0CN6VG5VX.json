                "reviewText": "Heavy duty high quality work horse of a carpet dog hair remover......so to speak. It is well made, with perfectly machined parts, so it's easy to assemble...... if there were any directions, I didn't see them, but I'll tell ya, I don't need no stinkin' directions... after all, I am man. Now, having said that, there's only one way to assemble this incorrectly, and that's exactly what I did, on my first try. I assembled the screw in pole sections, with the \"thick hand grip cushion\", down on the the \"second\" section, of the 4 section, pole. Upon realizing that was an oddly long way for me to be bending down to get a good grip, I deduced that the 2nd section, should indeed, be the \"3rd\" section, there by bringing the hand grip thing, up to a reasonable spot, for human use.... so a quick unscrew and a re-screw, reversing those two sections, and I was all set. I did it. I took on the task, with the initial \"pole section\" set back, unable to deter me, I plunged forward, analyzed the problem, applied my skills of logic, and viola, I had a correctly assembled, heavy duty, silicone brush, standing tall in front of me... knowing, at least this one time, I wouldn't be yelling for my wife to come help me. I was, at that moment, the king of my castle. Thank you. Thank you very much.And a nifty little pair of heavy duty silicone hand scraper tools too, what a deal. This is everything I hoped it would be. So gone are the days where I have to tell my wife every couple months, \"look at this.. watch what happens when I scrape my tennis shoes across our rugs... look at all that hair bunching up, all of that doesn't get sucked up by our multi-hundred dollar vacuum cleaner!!\". A problem, long ignored, year after year, is now ignored, no more. And you can take that to the bank. Over and out.",

                "reviewText": "The broom is easy to assemble and can be adjusted for length by removing sections. This was useful for me to use on my carpeted steps. I will say that it is a bit of a workout to push this through the carpeting due to the nature of the rubber having massive friction and being a sticky sort of silicone. That being aid I believe that is the science behind how it works so well. It pulls the pet hair that is embedded deep in the carpet fibers to the surface making it easier to vacuum. The included hand tools are a nice bonus. My daughter used on our furniture and I was surprised how much hair she was able to retrieve.",

                "reviewText": "Okay, first the negative. The two hand brushes can just be thrown away as far as I'm concerned. Yes, you can pull hair off with them. However, the hair isn't helf together and it's more of a mess to clean up than anything else.Now, on to the rake, I love, love, love i! Not only does it gather up the hair which I don't have nearly as much of as when I had Goldens, but it also gathers up anything else that you may have covering your carpets. Now most people probably don't have nearly as much \"other\" waste on their floors. However, with a bit over a Poochi like my little over a year pup (there's also a mix of Beagle, Terrier and Doxie to go with the Poodle and Chihuahua) there isn't a paper product, plastic bag and anything else she can destroy littering the floor. When I ordered this, I was hoping all would get gathered up. It does the trick.It's wider than my old carpet broom and clears an area fast and gathers up her hair and the cat's too. Very happy.",

                "reviewText": "The broom works very well on my rug in the middle of our living room where the dogs hangout the most and shed on the most (besided the bedroom rugs). It also picks up the other little debris on the rug as well. The squeegee isn't something that I will probably ever use unless I use this out in our carport. The hand brushes seem flimsy and almost useless at first but then I found that the handle which also looks flimsy is not. It's very solid and flexible and the brushes work well on pulling the hair off our dogs without harming them. It's a helpful tool for our pets and a win win.",

The handle and the rubber broom are not flimsy. When putting together the broom handle, you slide it together and then it screws into the other part of the handle. I have never seen this when purchasing other products like this. The rubber broom picked up pet hair from my floors and rugs easily. They also included 2 hand rubber brushes for furniture and you can put one in your car. I highly recommend this product.",

Of course, they work on carpet really well, and are great at getting pet hair off of upholstery. But believe me when I tell you the possibilities are endless.This one is decent quality, but I would be cautious about going too hard with it. The rubber squeegee part does twist off easier than I would like but all in all it\u2019s a solid 4 stars. The handheld tools are sweet too!I got this today and used it to scrub my walkway and porch, and it did the job!",
