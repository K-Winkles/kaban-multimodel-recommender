                "reviewText": "I looked at getting a pet hair broom, but for human hair. Two of us in the house have long hair that sheds like crazy, and I normally spend 20 minutes each vacuum time cutting the hair from the roller. It was crazy! So I bought this after reading the reviews.It works really well. I have noticed that on my shag carpet, I need to hold the broom more upright (where the bristles are a little flatter against the carpet...) And the squeegee side works amazingly well on my carpet too! I picked up so much hair! And my vacuum didn't need surgery afterwards...My only criticism (which took off a \u2b50) is that the pole is not the best. It's sturdy, yet flimsy if that makes sense. The metal pole seems like it would hold up quite well, but it is attached together with plastic rungs, which do not seem sturdy at all. I am tightening them repeatedly during use and I feel like those sections are going to snap during use.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using a short handled silicone brush for the dog beds. It was killing my back. Vacuums just don't get all the dogs hair of the beds.I saw this long handled version and had to try. Assembly was easy. Seems extremely sturdy. Did not bend at all when using hard on the dog beds.. Amazing, I could sweep standing up, not bent over! This broom pulls every single hair out of the canvas cover. I make a pile and then just sweep with another new broom I purchased at the same time.This silicone broom is the regular width. It rinses clean. I am guessing that the squeegee side may make washing screens and windows easier.This broom saves a great deal of time prior to using a vacuum on area rugs. It removes almost all the dog hair so the vacuum can do the hard work, getting the deep dirt out. No full cannister needing dumped just because of dog hair and losing suction because the hair is loading up the vacuum!Yes, if you have animals that shed, perfect. The scrubbing option is something I need to do to review how it works. I am guessing it will be perfect for my tiled screened in porches since it washes up so well, just guessing that I won't have to get 1 for indoor and 1 for outdoor. Have hopes I only need one. Only because it rinses and is exceptionally clean after a spray cleaner and water. Trying this 1st. Will try to revisit this review if it doesn't work. If you don't see an additional comment after this, assume that it works well.",
