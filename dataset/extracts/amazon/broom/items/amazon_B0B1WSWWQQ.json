I applied the cleaner, let it set, and while not having to be on my hands and knees scrubbing, was able to remove all dirt. I was able to scrub the corners where wall meets tile too since mop sucks there. Overall, I am very happy. My only worry is strength of the pole.",

                "reviewText": "I was so excited to get this because I've been fighting to clean the grout in my house without having to get down and scrub like Cinderella. So here are my lists of pros and cons:Cons: flimsy handle that constantly untwistsThe scrub head has a plastic attachment that snaps on to the handle. This was not a tight fit at all and it continuously fell off, so I had to reach my hands in the hot mop water to fish it out.It was not sturdy enough at all. When using the scrub side, it fell apart. The squeegee was ok, but again, fell off.The pros? After I spent over an hour trying to scrub just my kitchen, it's clean! But I had to get down on my hands and knees to scrub it.All in all. Dont waste your money. I'd attach a photo, but I got so mad at this thing falling apart that I literally threw it out of the garage.",

Considering this for the price factor and this is very good for such needs. Overall functional & would highly recommend it for its price.My 2 cents below:Pros:- Very functional tool & a must for any home cleaning needs- Good quality tool with a metallic build- Heavy duty & durable build quality- Easy to use & handle as the handles are long enough- Easy to assembly as it comes in a few pieces only- Reasonably priced in the competition for the quality & functionalityCons:- None that I see for this price and the quality",
