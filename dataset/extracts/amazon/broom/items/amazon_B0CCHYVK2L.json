                "reviewText": "This broom and dustpan set assembles easily. When not in use, the broom bristles rest inside of the dustpan, with the two components clipped together for easy storage. This set fits easily into a broom closet, or it can even be hung up, thanks to loops at the end of each handle.When you need it, it's easy to quickly locate both your broom and dustpan, since the two store together. No more searching around for the dustpan! The handles of each are long enough to be comfortable for most any sized user. I especially enjoy how the dustpan stands at the ready. Just sweep the mess into it, no need to bend over or stoop to hold the dustpan! It even has a yellow \"comb\" attached that serves to clean the broom's bristles.It's obvious to me that a lot of thought went into the design of this set. Sure, this broom and dustpan set won't replace a vacuum and a mop, however, it's just the thing for quick cleanups of dry messes.",

                "reviewText": "This broom is pretty nice but the brushes are not super stiff so they can fray easy. They also can miss some dirt or push out easy. I like that the dust pan has the bristles to clean off the lint though and that you can store the broom inside of it when you're done. Overall decent and gets the job done.",

                "reviewText": "The long handle on this dustpan is truly convenient. It means that I do not have to bend down all the way to the floor in order to sweep up a trash pile. They\u2019re sturdy yet lightweight and this is a notch on top of the dustpan that keeps the handle upright but it can be moved so that the handle moves freely. The dust pan has a holder on it so that the broom can be attached and they can be stored together.",
