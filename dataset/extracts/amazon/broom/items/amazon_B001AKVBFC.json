                "reviewText": "That is so true so often. We have all these different cleaning tools that help us in one way or the other. Some are better and others are among the best; however, that old standby 'ordinary broom' often gets lost in the dust. Libman has been a household name here for quite sometime. It is perfect for those many small cleanup jobs. Wooden handles when left outsides often rot before the broom's utility is over. Many metal ones act similarly, except they last somewhat longer.The added dust pan is a nice addition; however, it would have been nice if the end could have fit tight over the end so I would not have to bend all the way to the ground. Overstated, you say. Yes. That's a long way down to pick up trash. When you get here, you'll know. Regardless, this is a fine broom and it has its own place by the back door. It's also handy for sweeping critters back into the yard so they can maintain an ecological balance and not become food for the dogs.",

                "reviewText": "Feels a bit strange to be excited about a broom, but I love this thing. I previously had an old Libman broom that I thought was ok, but it was big and bulky and the bristles were ragged. This is light, easy to use, gets in corners, and almost works like a scrubber to get particles out of small spots. It's a smaller broom, so not for someone looking for a broom for large spaces or heavy-duty, but this is perfect for a smaller space. The dustpan attaches nicely on the broom, and I haven't had any problems with it not being flush against the floor. It's also on the lighter side. I'm not sure about the durability of the broom since I've only had it a few weeks, but I'm really pleased with the performance. I'm a little over 5'8\" and this is just about the right height (a tiny bit short), but like a said-great for a smaller broom.",

These long, silky, some variable broom fibers pick up everything with ease, from spilled flour to scraps of paper and other household debris. The angle gets right into corners and along edges. The dustpan is just as good, with a nice smooth, fine edge to catch everything the broom finds. The fact that the two fit together is a real bonus, because they're always together and take up only one hook for hanging. This is a sturdy, well-made, well-designed item that is modestly priced, to boot. Can't beat it.",

                "reviewText": "You may be surprised to know that I am talking about the 11 inch broom, the smallest of the three, for outdoors. Good for indoors, too, but the slant, smaller size, and having those heavy duty green bristles at the leading edge of this little jewel of a broom make it doable to get into corners and other hard places to get leaves, mold, dirt, mud, etc. out. I bought my first one of these 20 years ago, lasted like 15 years, and I still have its little stubby self left to use when I can't find one of the other two I've bought since then. I have tried others because I couldn't find one of these for more than a year when No. 1 wore down, and there is nothing else as good. Size does matter, because the small one is SO much more effective than any larger ones, probably because you can get more 'push' behind it without the bristles bending. ..perfect for sweeping yard refuse into a long-handled 'dust pan'. My favorite one of those is my Harry-from-Hawaii which I've had for 30 years; keep patching it because nobody makes these anymore. Once you try one of the smallish 11-inchers, you may join me in not wanting any other broom, even for outdoor use.",
