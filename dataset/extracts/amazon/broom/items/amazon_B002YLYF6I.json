                "reviewText": "This broom is great, as far as performance of the broom.Dirt & dust really seems to have no place to hide when this broom is brought on the case.However, I would like to warn those that have arthritis or carpal tunnel, or both that have weakness in their hands and arms that this is a heavy broom. (to me anyways, to make a very long story really short, I have rheumatoid arthritis & had carpal tunnel in both of my hands. I got to surgery for a carpal tunnel release just as fast as I could, but it was too late. The problem was severe & even with months of P.T. for my hands I still have a lot of weakness that has never gone away.)It is a great broom but heavy.The bristles are plentiful & strong.You can easily tell this is a quality broom & there seems to be no shortcuts taken in quality of the manufacturing of this broom.So if you re looking for a long lasting, high performance broom, here it is. If you are looking for a lightweight broom, I would look elsewhere.The shipping was great. I was amused when it arrived, as the bottom bristles had been sorta shrink wrapped and there were several pieces of taped on paper with my name on the broom. It did not arrive in a box, but I did not mind, as the item was not damaged & the presentation upon arrival was so funny looking.I will be buying another one of these brooms in the next little while, but I intend to look & see if another broom from the same manufacturer & line are available, maybe lighter weight.If I can find that, I will have my 5* broom.",

I was a little concerned about going with the \"extra large\" envisioning something huge...but the little bit of extra money for that extra space is a time saver. More floor space in less time...totally worth it. Bristles are tough, but not too tough; just right to get into corners and tight spaces. This is a great broom and worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "Lightweight and wide enough to clear leaves from a path really fast. Plus I like that it's plastic; the last one I had (a smaller one, different manufacturer I think) had metal parts that rusted out, and the broom fell apart. After I'd repaired that one 2-3 times and it fell apart again in yet another place, I bought this one, which I love. I figure the plastic should last well, so long as I don't leave it out in the sun.",
