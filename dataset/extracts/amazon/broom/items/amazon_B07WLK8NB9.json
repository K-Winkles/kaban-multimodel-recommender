A few roofs later, I can say this broom assembles easily, disassembles easily, is lightweight, and very sturdy.One thing you may want to address is that when using the broom, it's possible for the handle to be come unscrewed. This can be easily solved with some tape, or just being careful. So far it hasn't been a real issue for the light-duty roof sweeping I do, but I can see how it might bother someone doing a heavier-duty job.Highly recommended as a sturdy, lightweight, easy-to-transport broom for general use!",

The fact that the broom head screws onto the pole makes it great for compact shipping, but it isn\u2019t practical for everyday use because it comes loose while sweeping, making you have to stop every so often to tighten the head back to the pole.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent broom! I bought this one because of the stainless steel handle, since my other cheaper metal handle broom broke (go figure); let me tell you\u2014it\u2019s HEFTY and heavy, but I wouldn\u2019t change a thing! It DOES have a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it\u2019s very efficient. Because of the wide, angled head, it sweeps everything up in the first go! The bright lime green colored bristles and the shiny steel make me and my broom closet very happy \ud83d\ude0aAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a broom, but if you have to get one, this is the one to have for sure.",
