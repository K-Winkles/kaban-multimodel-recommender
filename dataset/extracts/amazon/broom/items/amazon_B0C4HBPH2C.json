These could just as easily be marketed to adults as well. You know, how about a grey one that looks war torn and has a radiation symbol on it? Lol... Heck, one of these broom and dustpan sets functions way better than any mini broom and dustpan set that I've ever had! Before I had one of these, if I wanted to quickly sweep up the area around my computer chair without moving the chair and all, I'd use a mini broom and dustpan set. And to sweep everything into the dustpan I'd have to bend way down to the ground... But not anymore. I just leave the middle piece out and only use the rod piece that would be the end of the broom, and I can sweep all around my computer chair without breaking my back like I used to. What's more, the broom part with the bristles works REALLY well.",
