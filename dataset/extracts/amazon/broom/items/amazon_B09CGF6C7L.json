The brush has a sturdy handle and long and soft bristles so they work great at picking up even the smaller things like cat fur and cat litter. I use this in my foster room where I have a crazy litter thrower. This helps with daily maintenance until the weekly cleaning. The brush set is also easy for storage or if you prefer to hang on the wall. I leave mine out in the corner for quick access.",

I figured a product like this one would be a good one too do the job.So far it fits the bill! It made cleaning much easier. The brush handle and brush itself seem of a decent quality even though it's mostly made out of plastic. I like the size because it was easy to pack into a bag, especially for camping because space is limited when you're doing that.Despite the great performance, I think the price was a little steep for what you get. Overall I would recommend this to friends with the reservation that they should look for something comparable for a little bit cheaper first.",
