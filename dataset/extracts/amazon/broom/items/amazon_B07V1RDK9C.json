We go through an absolute rediculous amount of brooms. We've tried thick wooden handle, but staff members still manage to break them in half. Weve went the super cheap route, that way atleast im not surprised when they are found in pieces. Some weekends, staff members will argue over brooms, and even hide them so that they can be the first to use it- while everyone else gets to hang out and wait. Who really thought that a broom can be detrimental for restaurant staff getting along. Its all fun and games, until someone needs a broom!!!!Anywho, I invested in fiberglass brooms for the kitchen ($$$), and these are designated to the dining room and bar. Theyre super easy to spray off as need. We love the taller handles, which seem very sturdy. They are light weight, easy to assemble, seem pretty sturdy, are oh so affordable, and have stopped employees from arguing and hiding brooms. Overall, I couldn't be happier. Hopefully they last longer than others, but even if my crew manages manage to destroy them- I can just come back and order more!",
