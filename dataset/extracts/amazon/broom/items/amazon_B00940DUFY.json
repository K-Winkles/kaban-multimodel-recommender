                "reviewText": "OXO always has excellent quality and this simple broom is no different. From the grip to the bristles, I've used this broom for a year now and it has lasted through consistent weekly use. Not only does it have great quality, but it's light weight, sturdy, and is thin enough to store any where. I usually need to plan to take out the broom to clean but have stopped thinking about cleaning and just take this out since it's easy to use and clean. Overall, OXO is a hidden gem of a company that makes some of the best household products I've used and the broom should only be the start of building out your set of cleaning tools.Overall: 5/5Recommendation: Buy it as this is the only broom you need and is as ideal of a product as it gets.Pros:- Light weight- Easy to use / Flexible head- Great quality rod, grip, and bristles- Does not wear easily even after a year- OXO has great products and all at a great priceCons: None",

Having used and appreciated OXO products, this was an easy choice. As it turns out, it is lightweight and maneuverable. We have a tough problem. We live right on a beach and sand gets everywhere. The bristles of the OXO broom are fine enough to catch the fine sand but not so stiff that they fling the grains around at the end of the stroke. The adjustable angle on the broom handle makes it easy to get under cabinets to get fine crumbs and dust.",

This is a high quality metal and plastic design (the broom stick itself is aluminum, and the head components plastic) that provides a very solid feel. The broom head is mounted on an adjustable angle pivot point so you can adjust the broom head to straight or angled position, and the angle you select is securely held in place by a ratcheting system, and it won't click out of place when you are using the broom. The bristles are a medium thickness with good feathering at the tip for excellent dust pickup for most normal indoor uses. I would not hesitate the recommend it, and it seems like the piece is well enough constructed to have a good service life. Five stars.",

                "reviewText": "I use this to sweep the kitchen floor most mornings after my wife has cooked the previous night. Really perfect for kitchen cleanup as the bristles are thin and densely packed on the broom head so even small particles of food are swept up. Lightweight aluminum handle, maybe a little bit shorter than it could be, but overall very nice to use. I hung it on the backside of the pantry door to keep the bristles straight. Nice broom.",

Trotz des horrenden Preises.Er fegt gr\u00fcndlich, wirkt stabil und ist wendig,aber nicht zu klein, um auch mal zwischendurch die ganze K\u00fcche und den ganzen Flur zu fegen.Empfehlung.",

Thought it was going to be a 45deg or 90deg type affair. Actually allows the angle to be varied in something like 10 degree variations, meaning I can't think of an agle you'd ever need that you'd ever want. Perfectly satisfied.",
