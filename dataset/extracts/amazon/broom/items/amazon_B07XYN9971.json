I had never worked with broomcorn before, so I wasn't sure exactly what to buy for my project, but this stuff is exactly what we were looking for...It's great for crafty projects! One pound gives you quite a bit...I ordered two lbs. to do a total of 6 bouquets and had some left over for a different craft!",
