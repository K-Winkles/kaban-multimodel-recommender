We had to put them together and right away I cracked one not bad but it\u2019s cracked cause I was doing too much trying to attach 2parts together. As everyone previously has mentioned, there are no instructions, so we put it together how we thought it goes. At first one was shorter than the other, but we fixed that and now the are good. Not sure if I would buy these again. Like I said they do the job but I feel like they aren\u2019t steady enough or something.",

Dust pan is also a weird height with all poles attached and too short when you take one pole off. Broom isn\u2019t as sturdy as I\u2019d hope and the swivel moves every time you sweep in a different angle which is annoying",
