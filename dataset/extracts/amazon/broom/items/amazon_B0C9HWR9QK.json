                "reviewText": "This brush set is just okay, not quite as useful as I'd hoped. I'd give it 3 stars for my cleaning purposes (mainly my walk-in shower), but since there's nothing deeply wrong with it, and others are likely to have different uses for it, I'm giving it 4 stars.Pros: The assortment of brush heads is nice, and decent quality. I normally don't like when poles come in segments you have to assemble, but these segments do feel sturdy when fit together. It feels like you could apply a good amount of pressure when scrubbing and the joints would not be a weak point.It's also nice to be able to remove a segment to make the handle shorter. I was constantly banging it against my shower walls when I tried to clean with the full length handle. So I'll definitely be removing a section if I use this again.Cons: The brush heads twist side to side, but would be a lot more useful if they pivoted 360 degrees. I thought I could use the long, narrow brush to clean under the lip of my shower, but since it only pivots side to side, I'd need to get down on my stomach in order to point the brush upwards and clean the shower lip.The brushes and sponge will eventually wear out, and it's not clear how you'd get a replacement (there don't seem to be replacement heads available at the time of review). The sponge is likely to wear out fastest, and attaches with velcro, so you might be able to figure out something to replace that.Overall, I'd say this is most useful for larger spaces without too many nooks and crannies.",
