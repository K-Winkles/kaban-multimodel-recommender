                "reviewText": "This is a decent broom for outdoors. It is assembled in a few different pieces, which can prove to be a problem at times. The handle is in a few parts, so it can sometimes untwist as you push the broom. The broom head isn't the largest, so it would be better for small decks and garages. The metal isn't going to bend easily. It is a shorter stick, so tall people wouldn't be able to use this easily.",
