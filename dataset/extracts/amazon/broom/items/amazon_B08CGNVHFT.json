                "reviewText": "At 63 y/o I imagine I have used brooms for at least 53 years. This broom has a long length, you can shorten if you like by removing a section. Extremely easy to screw together for assembly, short for teaching children, long for adults. The bristles are soft, incredibly soft yet strong. It gets into the grout lines in my tile due to the bristles, with out having to go down each line. A big plus when you live on the coast and deal with sand, plus dogs!Another great thing, the bristles don't hurt the walls! Had a fly on the wall and used this new broom. A first for no scratch marks on the paint. Also used for the annoying spider webs on the porch, not a mark on the ceiling. Addressing later, but will be getting another for outdoor use.It's sturdy, yet very light. It has a wide sweep area, but due to the lightweight it is a breeze to turn sideways in tight places.The bristles grab ahold of dog hair, you don't just sweep a pile. It's a great deal easier to go to the wastebasket and pull the hair off than getting a dustpan for just hair. Of course, sand and dirt need a dust pan.I am so happy with this broom I am going to get one for the screened in porches. The material it is made of appears to be easy to clean, perhaps even mold resistant . (Will try to remember to update this).Who would ever think that a broom would be worth a great review?This is a definite winner.",

                "reviewText": "How brooms actually clean concrete surfaces, garage, walkway, patio, porch, and the side walk is essential. A pine tree next door drops tons of needles on my property in the front of the house and this broom is better than any ever. It sweeps needles and other tree leaves from side walk, walkway, porch and grassy area extremely well. A recent purchase the broom feels durable and wide enough (14\") so it works fast, is soft enough to sweep up dirt and small debris for clean as new concrete. Read other product reviews, many of such features are missing in complaints! I looked online for hours and it paid off. I leave brooms out in the patio for quick leaf sweeps in hot or cold weather. Iron broom handles are hot or cold to the touch and rust and break from rain water. Wood handles are easily damaged by water and sun as are plastic handles. These stainless steel handles are not fragile to weather and temps with a solid holding surface. All extendable broom handles with 3 or 4 pieces will require tightening with regular use, that's why 4 stars. Do it and enjoy using this broom for many years on your clean exteriors as well as large multi surface indoor areas, hallways, offices, large business areas, lobbies, store fronts.",
