The angled bristles are manufactured from a single cast of high-quality rubber. The texture of the bristles assists in the formation of static charge, allowing the bristles to easily and conveniently suck up dust, pet fur, human hair, and other low-weight dirt from all solid surfaces The rubber broom not only picks up loose dirt, but it can also pull incredible amounts of hair and fur that the vacuum cleaner leaves behind, such as pet hair, human hair, sewing threads, and so on. Using short strokes, you create a static charge that not only lifts dirt and hair from the carpet but also prevents it from flying through the air. Quickly remove pet hair from high traffic areas and where your dog or cat likes to sleep. Because of the lightweight construction, this broom is particularly easy to grip and use for lengthy cleaning sessions. The high-quality design incorporates an extra-long handle with rubber bristles that can be used to remove hair, lint, dust, and grime off clothing, upholstery, and carpets, unlike other brooms. The long handle also makes it easy to clean ceilings, roofs, and other hard-to-reach surfaces.",

                "reviewText": "I got this too try to give myself an edge in the battle against shedding hairs in my home. I have a German Shepherd who sheds practically all year long and I often find little tumbleweeds of hair just floating around the house, cotton corners and under tables. The worst fit is when it gets caught into the rugs and carpeting and the static makes it so hard to brush away with a standard broom. With this silicone bristle room, though, I'm able to Bunch up the hairs and collect them in neat little balls and strips and pick them up to throw away. It's also great for scrubbing away Light stains or spills that have caked on to the floor from food or juice that I missed before. The width of the broom and allows me to get a much wider area and Tackle so much more space at one time. Assembly of the handle allows you to adjust the length at will to make this go from a handheld to a standard length broom when you need it.",

                "reviewText": "Bristles were soft & floppy, not nearly firm enough to get pet hairs off of carpet. It might work on a harder surface, but I doubt it.The handle and head were threaded, but didn't fit together and were so soft that you could just push the head onto the handle without turning.The handle was scraped and it had had a label on it prior to delivery that had been mostly scraped off. I suspect this was either a returned item or some kind of remainder or refurbished stock.",

The only advantage over my regular broom is that it can be cleaned. I figure it will be good for sweeping water off the court before play. Pet hair.... the hair floats around as you are sweeping, so a regular broom does a little better. Getting stuff into a dust pan is difficult --regular broom does better. Dust/fine particles -- good, but so is my broom; they do about the same. Rugs - it did work well on the floki rug as these are difficult to vacuum. I would not buy again as it doesn't do enough difference for the money. But if it meets a need, there's nothing inherently wrong with the item.",
