            "All Kinds of Spills-The small hand sweeper is handy for kitchen counter like collecting crumbs, spilled salt/sugar, wrappings, for camping like getting dirt out of the tent, for pets like cats litter box etc",
            "Easy Storage-When you\u2019re done, snap the brush into the dustpan, and store with its convenient hang-up feature, always keep the hand broom and dustpan set within reach",
            "Master Design-The teeth at both sides of the dust pans offer hands free cleaning for brush. The scraper removes the hard residue. Handle is angled for quick and easy countertop use. Thanks to the perfect angle of the pan, even the smallest crumbs are gathered up rather than sliding underneath",
            "Goes into Tight Place- The angle of the brush and the round shape of the brush head make it easy to reach even in corners and smaller spaces. It's great for cleaning up after kids and pets, as well as getting the crumbs off your keyboard etc"

                "reviewText": "Sometimes I have just a few crumbs on the floor, or even a leaf or two that gets tracked into the house, and this Dust Pan and Brush set is perfect to use for cleaning up small particles like that. The handle of the brush fits nicely into the handle of the dustpan, snug enough to stay together, but not too tight in that it's hard to separate. The opening for hanging it is plenty big, giving me the option of what kind of hook to use when storing it. If you don't want to use a vacuum or full-size broom to tackle small areas of debris, this is a good brush and dust pan set to have on hand!",

                "reviewText": "This is a good industrial-style dustpan and broom set, made from heavy plastic with strong long nylon bristles. Its appearance is plain and workmanlike, but it's well-designed, even including \"teeth\" on the upper edges of the dustpan that you can use to scrape dust bunnies out of the brush bristles.For the price, you get good quality and good design, I don't think it'll ever wear out. Since none of its components care about getting wet, it looks like you actually could use it in your kitchen to sweep cuttings into the trash or sink, as long as you don't care about style. I doubt I'll ever use it that way but see no reason it wouldn't do just fine.Recommended to help keep things neat and clean everywhere!",
