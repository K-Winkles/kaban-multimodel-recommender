All wood. Now I have had so many brooms over the past 50 years of marriage and this one will not only out last me but probably my kids. It picks up dirt so much better than brooms made with those plastic type bristles it is an expressive purchase for a broom but you will not be disappointed and I bet anything it will be the only broom you will ever have to buy. Only thing is you will need to replace just the bristle portion some years from now otherwise not one complaint",

I also bought the dust mop attachment because a broom doesn\u2019t quite get some of that fine dust or pet dander that remains on smooth floors plus it gets under couches better. Consider other attachments now, you won\u2019t be disappointed!!",

The quality is great and I can't see needing to replace it for some time. But when I do need a new one I'll get this again. I really can't say how much I love this broom.",

When I moved out and bought a red broom, the kind the big box stores sell, I was extremely disappointed. When my parents passed about 15 years ago, one of the things from their home I got was the broom. Really, it was that good. I don\u2019t know why my siblings did not want it. Maybe they never did their chores.Anyway, fast forward to 2021, and my parents broom is still going strong. But I have it in the basement. I wanted a broom just a good as it for the main floor. So I ordered this one because the reviews are good and it looks the same as my fabulous broom. Guess what: this broom is just as good as the broom I have from the 60s. It is a fabulous purchase.Now if only someone would make a dust pan as good as the one my parents had, and that I still use.",
