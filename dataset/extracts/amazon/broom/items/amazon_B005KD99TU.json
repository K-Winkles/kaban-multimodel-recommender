                "reviewText": "Loved getting thus, proof positive that the USA can still make quality home goods. We needed this for sweeping areas our big floor size pole cross bedrooms can't get into, and this brim is great. Its pole is thick and sturdy wood, the corn straw area is triple stiches in several bands, and very thick versus cheap brooms heads. Definitely will buy again. Thank you seller!",

Being someone who needs to sweep from time to time, this broom permits you to do so while maintaining an erect posture. The handle was thick and sturdy. I felt like a gladiator entering the battle arena with staff in hand! It will be quite some time until I find another product as innovative as this modern marvel! Dirt and debris stand no chance against this Goliath. Sweep on, my friends!",

It\u2019s got a good, thick, sturdy handle. Well packed bristles. None of that plastic nonsense that just pushes hair and dirt around and then gets stuck in the bottom forever. When it arrived at my house I gasped \u201cmy broom!\u201d And made my roommate look at it. That\u2019s when it happened. That\u2019s when I reached my final form of peak cottage witch.
