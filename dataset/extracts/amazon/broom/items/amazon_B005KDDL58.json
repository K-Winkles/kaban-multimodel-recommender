If you do not know what a lobby broom is, it is the short broom the janitor uses when he sweeps the lobby. The broom is small enough to easily use with one hand, and is generally meant to be used with an over-sized dust pan on a stick. If you still do not know what a lobby broom is, google search lobby broom and look at the images. most of the images are of just the broom, but there is one image of a man using a lobby broom with the dust pan. There you go.Now, this is not the best lobby broom I've ever used, but it is the best I've found online. I work at a restaurant with a carpet floor and need to sweep under tables. The bristles are stiff enough to sweep on the carpet, which is something you would think they would advertise (they do it to toothbrushes after all.) I bought this broom because the one good broom we had broke and the managers are too cheap to buy a new one. Whenever I go to work, I bring my own broom with me, and everyone wants to borrow my broom. It is easily the best at the restaurant, and the managers keep saying they will buy one of these. I'll hold my breath.Short because it's s'posed to be, and has sturdy bristles.",

But know what you're getting; you can't use this for general purpose sweeping, at least unless you're under 4' tall or like to stoop a lot. The plastic bristles are great for sweeping off of low-pile carpet too.",
