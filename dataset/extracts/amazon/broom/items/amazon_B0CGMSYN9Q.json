                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This 2-in-1 Broom & Floor Sweeper is very convenient for cleaning the floor. The assembly is a little bit complicated, yet still fine with a reference to the user manual. The manual is well-written with step-by-step instructions. The good thing is it is 2-in-1 so it saves storage space and makes it faster to sweep and pick up the crumbs.It is lightweight considering putting two tools into one. It looks sturdy and durable. The switching of the broom and floor sweeper is simple and fast. The broom works smoothly and quietly. The width is not too big so it is convenient to sweep the narrow and hard-to-reach areas. The self standing ability is a plus so I can put it anywhere and not always need to lean on the wall.The con of the floor sweeper is that it doesn't pick up all the crumbs with ease. Sometimes, I have to move several times to pick up the last piece of crumbs. Overall, it works well and it is a good alternative to the vacuum cleaner especially when a small area is needed to be cleaned.",

                "reviewText": "I got this to use in my bedroom. I like that it stores small and allows a vacuum and broom to be stashed and not take a lot of space. It is lightweight and you can switch between roller and broom function without having to dump the catch bin.There are a couple of things that could use improvement. The head is very narrow, and I could have used a wider option. It is good at picking up smaller things, but larger things (like leaves) or heavier things (like pon gravel) just get pushed around.Seems sturdy enough, and it will get used, but not the magic I had hoped for.",

                "reviewText": "I was really looking forward to trying out this broom sweeper after seeing the two modes that it has. After using it however I am a little underwhelmed. It was pretty easy to assemble in just a couple minutes and the broom works well as it should, but it is a little smaller than your normal house broom which does not make it ideal if you have a large home. The function to switch it to a brushroll didn't always work the best though and the brushroll that is supposed to pick up everything you just swept into a pile did not work as intended a majority of the time. It often times just spread your nealty swept pile around on the floor requiring you to sweep it back into a pile again and trying to rollover it again rather then picking everything up in one go. This made it so that we hardly ever used the brushrooll feature and opted to just sweep it into a dustpan or vacuum the pile up. The $55 price tag is also way to high for this product. The quality and functionality of it does not warrant that price whatsoever. I would suggest just getting a $10 broom with a dustpan over this. Overall, I cannot recommend this unless it drops to around $25 and even then with the brushroll being hit or miss in picking stuff up I still do not know if I would recommend it.",
