It is pretty secure, so broom and pan stay together. The flexible leading edge of the pan works well to create no gap for dirt to slide under the pan. I use in shop for small messes on bench, but also in horse feed trough to clean out non-edible debris. Horses don't mind. Overall, good value for a small dust pan that works. This item not regular size dust pan, but slightly bigger than hand size.",
