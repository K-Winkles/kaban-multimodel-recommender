It's only three-four pieces but the pole pieces took a sec for me to figure out. The overall usefulness is great. It definitely picks up the cat hair I didn't see. It's just so flimsy in your hand that it's a little hard to \"sweep\". I'm still going to try the Broombi to see how the two compare",

Works like the videos and everything gets into the dustpan. Very easy to assemble, it\u2019s sturdy and very light weight. I\u2019ve only used it as a broom so far, and it definitely picks up everything.",
