                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this broom, and while the brush itself is highly effective at sweeping away dust and debris, the handle leaves much to be desired. Unfortunately, it has a tendency to untwist frequently, interrupting my cleaning flow. The handle consists of about five twists on bars, and the yellow section has pinched me a few times, which is quite bothersome. It would be great if there was an option to replace the handle while keeping the excellent brush intact. For those who plan on vigorous sweeping sessions, be prepared to stop and tighten the handle regularly.",
