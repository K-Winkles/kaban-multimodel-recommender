                "reviewText": "Since this set is so cute looking and so easy to use I found myself to rich for it just for funand do small cleanup jobs more often which is great exercis and joy.I like the quality of the plastic which is slick and expensive looking.The size is great too, It is not humongous as some of those set pans are. Just right. I would say the size of pan is on smaller size, not too small but not big or huge.The brush is kind of soft but not super soft. I wish it were just a tad stiffer but it does the job.The comb installed to brush off the brush is very useful and I love it.Flatness of the lip is good, some complained I read in reviews. I found zero problem. It is flat andthat is that.I made it shorter! I found the broom bit to long for myself and I removed one section from itand tadaaaa.. it got instantly perfect for me. So something for you to consider.I really love this set. I like the color that looks fresh and clean and I love to use it.It is fun to use and it is cute enough not to be an eyesroe wherever I put it.I totally recommend it for the kitchen use or small jobs around the house.It saves the back banding from using small dustpan.Perfect for anyone who has trouble bending.",

The night I got it, I accidentally broke the glass from a picture frame, and every time I tried sweeping the pieces into the dustpan, the glass went under it.

I am very dainty with things, not hard on stuff, but this is weak even for me.The new one is the blue n black one, old ones are red/green. my old ones will still work better than the new one.The broom part itself is too short, (bristle part, not handle). does not cover a very wide area, takes forever to sweep because the bristles of the broom itself only cover about the same amount of space as a handheld mini broom for small spaces.Also the bristles are bent up, I don't like that because then dirt escapes or gets flung away from me bcuz of it.Dirt goes under the dustpan not into it because it's bent/bows up in middle of bottom upon pressure from weight of handle when sitting on floor.I want a refund but I'm disabled so its too hard to go mail it back. Throwing in trash i guess. and i won't pay for ups pickup.",
