                "reviewText": "After using the blue Broom and Dustpan Set for some time, I have found it to be a reliable and effective cleaning tool. The broom's bristles are stiff enough to pick up dirt and debris, yet gentle enough to avoid scratching floors or surfaces. The dustpan is also well-designed, with a wide mouth that makes it easy to sweep debris into the pan.One minor drawback of this set is that the broom handle sometimes is loose and has to be readjusted which can make it uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time. However, this is a minor issue that can be easily remedied using the broom in shorter intervals.Overall, I would rate this blue Broom and Dustpan Set as a solid 4 out of 5 stars. It gets the job done effectively and is a great value for the price.",

When I moved into my own place I compared it to the flimsy ones at my local Walmart and Target and this one was better. It's lightweight but sturdy. The broom stick can be adjusted to a shorter length if desired. I oped to take one pole off of the dustpan for ease of use. The rubber on the pan keeps it flat so dirt sweeps right in. The bristles spread wide and the teeth is a great addition for those of us with long hair. It stands upright on its own too. I do have to tighten the threads form time to time and may put some glue. Otherwise, I might buy another one to use outdoors.",
