                "reviewText": "My daughter is 18 months and uses this off and on. It is honestly a bit short for her, and she is very tall for her age (99 percentile in height and weight), so perhaps it would fit up to a 3 year old easily. She loves to help with 'broam' after every meal :) and this is a useful substitute that doesn't potentially cause any issues for her tripping over it. She does struggle to use the dustpan, but she is quite young. Overall, I don't regret buying this, but if it were a bit taller and sturdier, it would be 100% a great buy. I'd rank it as a pretty good buy for your buck.",
