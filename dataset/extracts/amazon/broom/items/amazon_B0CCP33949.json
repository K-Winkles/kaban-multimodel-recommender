This set includes a broom and a dustpan that can be easily assembled together to create an upright and ergonomic cleaning tool.One of the best things about this sweep set is its ergonomic design. The broom and dustpan are both designed to be used while standing upright, which means you don't have to bend over to sweep and collect dirt and debris. This makes it much easier on your back and knees, especially if you have a lot of sweeping to do.The broom itself is made of high-quality materials and features durable bristles that are great for sweeping up all kinds of debris, including dust, dirt, and small pieces of trash. The dustpan is also well-designed, with a deep and wide collection area that makes it easy to sweep up even large piles of dirt and debris.Another great feature of this sweep set is its compact and lightweight design. The broom and dustpan can be easily disassembled for storage or transport, and they don't take up much space. This makes them great for small apartments or homes where storage space is at a premium.Overall, the Upright Dust Pan Combo Sweep Set is a great cleaning tool that is both effective and easy to use. Its ergonomic design, durable materials, and compact size make it an excellent choice for anyone who wants to keep their floors clean without straining their back or knees.",
