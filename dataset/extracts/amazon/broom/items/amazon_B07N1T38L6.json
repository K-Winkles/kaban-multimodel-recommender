                "reviewText": "First, ignore the reviews that claim the sections don't have the correct male/female ends to assemble it. Although it appears the male/female ends are wrong, they do in fact assemble very securely. Second, ignore the reviews complaining of receiving a used/dirty broom. It is obvious in the review photos, that some reviewers do not understand what \"flagged\" bristles means.I wanted a smallish broom, in terms of width of the sweeping head and overall height. I use a broom 2-3 times a day to sweep cat litter (pelletized pine) in the laundry room, with a quick one-handed sweep. The petite sweeping head on this broom is perfect for the small task. It also allows me to easily sweep in tight areas, and then into my Oxo dustpan.I omitted one of the sections of the broom handle to make it shorter. The shortened version (with one section omitted) is exactly 37 inches from the hanging hole to the bottom of the bristles. I can't speak to how it would perform at full height in typical two-handed sweeping, but it is perfect for the quick one-handed sweeping I do in a small area, and performs its task very well.The broom feels substantial and sturdy without being too heavy. Overall, it was a good value.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that I would have preferred the option to buy the broom without a dustpan. I did not need nor want this dustpan, so it went directly into a box for Goodwill, which is a big waste of plastic.",

Well, I had to switch to Dollar Tree brooms for years just because I knew those two boys would take my broom no matter where I hid it, and play their Little Star wars games. No more! This broom from the Basic collection of Amazon, is FABULOUS!!!! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d! Oh my god! Sturdy, just the right height, very good bristles.

                "reviewText": "Arrived broken at the neck where the handle screws in. No reason it should\u2019ve been broken. It comes unassembled in a very sturdy corrugated cardboard box which appeared undamaged. We tried some glue that is supposed to fuse plastic, but that didn\u2019t work on this type of plastic. We tried Krazy glue, that didn\u2019t work. We taped it, which is a temporary fix. I planned to send it back, but I just wanted to see how well it worked first to see if I wanted to get another one or get a refund and look further. It was so clunky and hard to use that I decided to not replace it. The bristles are stiff \u2013 they flex and then snap back, scattering the swept pieces again. And the dustpan house has a ridge that you have to sweep over. Really a bad design. Unfortunately, I\u2019m stuck with it. They gave me a refund but didn\u2019t want me to send it back. So now I have this barely functional broom that I don\u2019t know what to do with. I got the refund, but I\u2019ve got this stupid white elephant that isn\u2019t good for anything but isn\u2019t quite bad enough to throw away yet. I suppose the metal handle is recyclable, but the rest is landfill.",

                "reviewText": "I recently bought the Amazon Basics Dustpan Broom Set in Blue&White and I am thrilled with my purchase. The set is made with high-quality materials, and it features a durable broom head that picks up even the smallest dirt particles with ease. The dustpan is also well-designed, with a raised lip to prevent debris from sliding over the edge. What I appreciate most is how easy it is to use - the dustpan clips onto the broom handle for convenient storage and the sweep angle is perfect to ensure all dirt and dust is picked up.The set is lightweight, simple to store, and easy to maneuver. What's more, the blue and white color scheme is really attractive and makes it easy to spot the broom and dustpan in my closet. I have used other brands' dustpan and broom sets in the past, but this has been the best one so far. It really helps me keep my home cleaner than before, and I recommend it to everyone who needs a simple, but effective cleaning solution. If you're in the market for a practical, affordable, and high-quality dustpan and broom set, this is definitely the one to go for!",
