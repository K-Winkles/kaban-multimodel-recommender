                "reviewText": "Perfect broom in many ways. Gets into those cracks in the outdoor bricks and pavements.. Sweeps up spent bird seed, fallen leaves, dirt and pea gravel. Broom is actually fun to use. I did have to return / exchange the first one as the paint on the handle was cracked. The paint on the second one was much better but not perfect, wondering if I will have to apply varnish or a second coat of paint at some time. Could be better quality there as I plan to keep and use this broom for a long time and don't want splinters. The broom is a bit heavy, am nearly 70, female, but I've quickly become used to it and it's now my favorite broom for those jobs were I can't use a flat push broom.",

These are excellent, heavy duty straw brooms. They are quality construction, using excellent materials. The workmanship is very well done and the handle is more than adequate to facilitate any sweeping until the straw is completely worn out.Thank you, O-Cedar for continuing to offer excellence in your products.",

                "reviewText": "I was very happy to get my 1st corn broom from O-Cedar. The broom did arrive with the black handle very poorly painted. Whatever machine was used to apply the paint, it did a very poor job. It looks like a tie-dyed item. I thought about returning it, but decided that I really needed it for my upcoming garage project and could not wait for a replacement. I do like the broom very much. It is a bit heavy, but very durable. I have since ordered one for my sister. There is nothing like a sturdy, corn broom for sweeping.",
