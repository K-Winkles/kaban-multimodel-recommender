                "reviewText": "I was a little skeptical about buying this type of broom/dustpan. I was looking for a quality broom, but most brooms hate me. The fibers end up sticking out every which way and the debris gets caught in them. Well, so far, this is a joy. The fibers are pretty stiff (but still soft enough to sweep) and everything gets in the pan which has a nice rubber edge. But the best thing of all is the way that it takes on the dustbunnies! I hate to clean and usually accumulate a lot of them and they normally get stuck in my broom so I have to bend over and remove them with my hand. The prongs on this dustpan easily remove the dustbunnies and your broom is good to go. You can do quite a bit of sweeping before you need to empty the bin and the set stands upright, so nothing falls out. The actual broom is much sturdier than I expected it to be and the adjustable grip makes it easier to sweep. I highly recommend this broom set.",

                "reviewText": "I have to say, this broom combo set has been an incredible addition to my cleaning routine. With its 52'' long handle and thoughtful features like self-cleaning teeth and a standing dustpan, it has completely outperformed my previous broom and dustpan set, which I purchased at Walmart. The quality of this set is truly exceptional. The materials used are of a much higher standard, ensuring durability and reliability for all my cleaning needs. This set is built to last, and I can already feel the difference in its performance. Not to mention, it adds a touch of elegance to my home with its stylish design. It's a step up from other, lower-priced alternatives, and while it might come with a slightly higher price tag, the improved quality and aesthetics make it a worthwhile investment in the long run. In summary, this broom set has not only made my cleaning tasks easier but has also added a touch of sophistication to my living space. I am thoroughly impressed with the improved build quality, innovative features, and appealing design. The slightly higher cost is definitely worth it for the enhanced cleaning experience and the aesthetic value it brings to my home.",
