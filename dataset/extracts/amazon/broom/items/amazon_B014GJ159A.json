Do Not Buy this junk, doesn't clean anything, leaves a pile of bristles when ever you use. JUNK. This company sucks, only produce crap, these are worth ~50 cents, and at that you would be overpaying. CRAP-CRAP so disgusted want to throw them all out, but they are taking care of it by disintegrating at every use. CRAP. Buy ANYTHING else but this disgusting product. Full of seeds also, maybe you can grow your own brushes. HA! Should be illegal to sell crap like this.",
