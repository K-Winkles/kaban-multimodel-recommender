I\u2019ve had other \u201c broom holders \u201c that took up precious narrow wall space . Not very practical if they need a lot of clearance in narrow areas to work.These don\u2019t need a lot of space. In fact the first one I installed is in a narrow space between my fridge and the wall. No more than 4 inches. I was able to reach back and attach one of the broom holders and I am able to get the broom handle back there and place it in the press in latching system that this product has.So far it seems to be holding to the wall just fine . I did wash the wall and dry it before attaching the broom holder. Plus I am letting it \u201c cure \u201c in the hopes that it holds well for a long time .My only issue is that there were no instructions on how to use the adhesive or how long to \u201c cure\u201d it before using the device .Other than that, it\u2019s a good product for a good price!Would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "These work very well at keeping your cleaning equipment well-organized and up off the floor to dry off after use. The 3M stickies that came with it are sturdy and stick very quickly. The clasps are super tight which is great for holding varying rod sizes but the thicker rods definitely take a bit of effort to slide in/take out for the elderly, so keep that in mind if getting this for your grandparents / older relatives.1 less star because a few of them had very sharp, unpolished edges (on the hooks and backing) that scratched up one of my hands when I was unwrapping, so be careful when taking these out!",

Once you stick it can't be pulled out any more, unless you just discarding the adhesive. It can carry heavy mops. Its not hard to remove my broom or mops from the gripper. I will purchase again.",
