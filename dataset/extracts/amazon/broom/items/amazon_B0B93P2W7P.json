After using our Shark vacuum, I used the rake. Although it didn't pick up much fur (apparently Shark lives up to their reputation). It did make our carpet look better. The rake works great for under the beds and in our vehicles. Also use it to clean the endless spider webs that cling to our house. Love the squeegee too, makes cleaning windows a breeze! The possibilities are endless!",
