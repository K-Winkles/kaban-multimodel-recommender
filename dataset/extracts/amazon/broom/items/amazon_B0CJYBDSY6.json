                "reviewText": "The Good:- Very good suction for a small engine.- Easy to use one-handed.The Bad:- The tubes and accessories are slide-fit (not push-button connected like most) and the fit is sub-standard. The connection points are weak and sometimes come apart while vacuuming. I also feel I need to be careful not to break the connection at the housing, which seems like the weak point.- Obviously, on a unit this small, it needs to be dumped and cleaned with compressed air to properly maintain long-term suction. That's fine for me since I have an air compressor.This is a unique vac that has its uses, especially if you work on a bench making small items like carving figurines and you want a convenient way of keeping the workplace clean. You can use this as a stick vac, but, you may be frustrated by how rickety the pieces stay together and I'm confident that it's only a matter of time before the connection at the housing breaks, it's simply too weak.The mfgr can make this a 5-Star product by fixing the connection method (easy push-button clicks) and redesigning how the accessories & tubes attach to the body. Otherwise, this is a limited-use vac for unique situations.",
