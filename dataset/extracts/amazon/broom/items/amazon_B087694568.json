Would have much preferred a traditional WOODEN stick. For average person not serious about doing yard work and cleaning or light sweeping, might be OK, however, I do serious cleaning and would prefer something more durable. Luckily was able to modify with traditional wooden stick to attach to broom head. They need to offer optional wooden handle. Would simply ship in longer box, etc.",

                "reviewText": "I was recommended to buy a soft bristled brush when I had a new patio installed and so I chose this one. It arrived on time, well packaged and I put it together in less than a minute - the sections of the handle just slot together.The bristles are soft but there are a lot of them and the head of the brush is wide so everything is taken up usually in the first sweep. It doesn\u2019t scratch the surface so although I keep it for patio use, I would use it on a wooden floor. I am very pleased with it.",
