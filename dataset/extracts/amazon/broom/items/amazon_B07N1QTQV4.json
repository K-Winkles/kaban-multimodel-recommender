I got this to replace my worn out straw/corn broom for outside & it is really excellent! I just love it! I am always having to sweep up dirt, pet hair, grass, you name it off the porch all summer long + cobwebs on the ceiling & this broom does an excellent job! It really holds to its description of heavy duty! I also use it on my flagstone walk, the streetv& my driveway with great results. With the sturdy, tall heavy duty metal broom handle that is of a larger circumference than most(nothing like a dollar store)I can reach under furniture or up high easily& as it grabs almost all debris in one sweep so the chore goes faster. It screws together& the broom part has a very good heavy plastic connection so it doesn't keep coming loose & won't break! The bristles are thick & stiff but not too stiff so it can handle outside stuff but also is dense enough to get all the dust & small particles. I am so happy with my new broom & it makes cleaning so much easier & kind of fun! I love it!(& I have never loved a broom before! Lol!)",

                "reviewText": "This broom is lighter than my former broom and includes split edges and an angle for tough to reach places. It isn't as firm for lifting nap on carpet or slush off walkway, although a good all-around broom, gentle on satellite dish during snowstorm, doesn't scratch floors, good for ceiling fans and great for vigas (a SW thing). Comes together E-Z, then stable, looks nice. 5-STARS",

                "reviewText": "I was a little hesitant getting a broom that came in pieces as they tend to bend and brake where you attach them, but this one surprised me. It is so heavy weight and sturdy! I've been using it for several weeks now and not had any issues at all. The bristles are really long and do a great job on both our laminate floors and carpets, collecting general dust, pet hairs, etc with ease. It's like a really nice mix of a broom and a standard brush. Perfect for day to day house chores! Would highly recommend as a low cost but super reliable broom.",
