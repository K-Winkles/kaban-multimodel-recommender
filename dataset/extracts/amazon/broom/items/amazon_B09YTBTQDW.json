                "reviewText": "Hi, I'm pleased with my purchase of this sweeper (head) , works mostly as described, I say that as I was replacing the sweeper (head part) on my old Vileda broom, the screw in part of this brand handle (Vileda) is a bit too large to fit, so I bought another broom handle at a Dollar type store and it fit perfectly. This Sparta Broom head (sweeper) works like a charm! I took off one star out of 5 for the reason that the broom handle I had didn't fit this broom head, therefore not a universal screw in part of head. Great Value for replacing the head though! Just know if doesn't fit your handle the ones at the popular discount store will fit for $2.00",
