This is a miracle for our environment.I like the maneuverability of each one being individual. It allowed us to space them for the needs of our wall. They hold every size of handle for our brooms and mops with no slippage.I highly recommend these holders!",

                "reviewText": "This broom holder is sturdy and good looking; it wouldn't be out of place in an entryway. It is made of a bright stainless steel with two rubber rollers, a rubber pad at the back to prevent the broom from hitting the back too hard, and even stainless steel caps that cover the screw heads. None of my mops or broom handles merit this degree of care, but other folks may wish to use the holder in a location that requires such a design.The holder comes with two different methods of attachment: 3M double-sided sticky pads, and screws. The seller also includes anchors for drywall installation. I was reluctant to install the holder with the double-sided pads only because the spring of the rubber rollers is pretty tight and it takes a fair bit of tugging on the broom handle to remove from the holder. Instead, I screwed the holder directly into wood, and it is holding just fine.The only complaint I have is that the screw heads sheared right off when I put them in (very carefully) with a power screwdriver. Because I had to use my own screws, I couldn't use the ingenious caps that they provide to cover the screw heads. Other than the screwhead issue, the installation was a breeze.",

                "reviewText": "I'd specifically picked this product as a space-saving tool for storing outdoor brooms and a snow shovel in our mudroom. I wasn't particularly concerned with the cosmetic look of the holder and didn't have access to a power drill at the time, so I opted to bypass the anchors and simply screwed the holders directly into the wall. Obviously it will depend on the material, but I was easily able to screw the holders into the mudroom wall manually with a standard philips-head screwdriver. I don't foresee an issue with this method (wood splitting, etc), but will update if any occur. I am pleased to have multiple options for install that are all relatively simple. The holders themselves appear decently manufactured; nothing cheap or flimsy. The product description only lists mops and brooms but I've attempted to hang our snow shovel from them as well and thus far it works just as well. The handle on the shovel is a bit wider and doesn't slip into the holder as completely, but the grip makes up for it and has been holding sturdy for a few days now. Having my items up off the floor has already improved the amount of available space in the mudroom and will likely help to keep the bristles on the brooms clean while being outdoors. Definitely worthwhile for the price.",

I really like how adhesive the sticky takes are so I don\u2019t have to drill holes in the walls. What got my vote is that they\u2019re separate. I have them where they belong bathroom kitchen and wherever I have something for it to hold on to",

I liked them so much because they are all able to be mounted individually into place, plus you can mount them with screws to make them extra sturdy and heavy duty - they hold more weight than the typical wall mounted mop or broom holders out there for this reason. The holders are also very sleek and attractive looking in addition to being so practical.They are basically flawless, and I\u2019ve had zero problems with them so far. They\u2019ve been perfect and have made getting my home more organized so easy. Five stars for sure. A+++++ highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "These work as advertised. They have a rather sturdy backer can come with strong 3M adhesive strips if you don't want to drill. I personally wouldn't use the 3M strips, but if you're just hanging a broom or mop in a closet, I expect it would be more than strong enough. The bracket has a fairly stiff & strong grip with a couple large rubber bumpers on the ends to help hold. The bracket metal is a bit thinner than I'd like to see to call it \"sturdy\" -- or to have faith it will hold up to years of use. But it went up fine and holds basically all the handles tools I threw at it, so no complaints right now.",
