There's no advantage to this set over any other one. The dustpan doesn't allow for that last line of dirt to be swept in any better than anything else I've used.I think the design of this product was focused on saving money through the packaging size, hence why it arrives in pieces. Easier, cheaper to ship in a smaller, uniform sized box. Yet this set still costs more than the ones at your local store.",

Totally wobbly, flimsy and cheap.Bristles are TOO SOFT and TOO LONG to even sweep. Who needs a 50\" long handle???? NO ONE. Brush immediately gets all splayed out, so won't even fit back in the tray to store. The broom is too big to fit in the rounded rake, so that one good feature doesn't even work. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP I feel like a chicken!!!!!",
