But every time I go to sweep dirt into the bin it misses 40% of the dirt that was supposed to go in. I don\u2019t know if mine is deformed in someway. But. Honestly. Getting a new broom today.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great set of dust pan and broom that allows me to sweep and clean the garage floors without having to bend down or scoop over garbage. The dustpan opening is flushed to the floor and has long handle to hold while using the long broom to sweep things inside the dustpan. My favorite part is the dustpan teeth where I can easily shake off things off the bristle that are hard to get off such as feather and hairs due to static. Like many other similar dustpan and broom set, it can stand upright with the dustpan opening upwards so that dust and garbage stay inside with the broom locked to the dustpan handle for easy storage. Highly recommend it!",
