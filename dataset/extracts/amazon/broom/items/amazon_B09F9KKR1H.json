The hand tool works OK in that it moves pet hair and lint into clumps that are then easy to remove by hand, but it doesn't actually pick up the pet hair like the broom. This is apprently due to the longer softer bristles on the hand tool. The hand tool was just a bonus item to the purchase though, so all in all, we are happy with the purchase and recommend the product.",

                "reviewText": "I love this broom. It does an unbelievable job loosening dirt and hair from my carpets before vacuuming. It is also great for sweeping on tile and wood floors. My only complaint is the top metal pole used to connect the pieces together started splitting after a few months. It\u2019s now at the point that the broom is no longer functional. I\u2019ll replace it with a similar style but not this exact one due to the potential of it happening again.",

It would be ok, except it's the top piece that can be adjusted. I am not going to waste time or gas to return it. I am looking for a better handle. I am very sad.So the broom is perfect. I love how I can adjust the length and how wide the broom head is. The color is very pretty and the bristles are soft. The only reason for 3 stars is the hand held pet and furniture brush. The bristles are all bent. I don't know how I will be able to use it this way.",
