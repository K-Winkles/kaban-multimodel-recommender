                "reviewText": "I inherited a plastic bristle broom and it is terrible at sweeping the driveway. I purchased this one and it was only poor at doing the job. Finally purchased a actual straw bristle broom like school custodians use and that works great. In short this was better than other plastic bristle brushes however this one still misses about 30% of the debris so find something better.",
