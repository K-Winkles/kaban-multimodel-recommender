                "reviewText": "This is the type of corn broom that I remember as a child!, the 'Halloween-witch' type of broom! It arrives in a surprisingly smaller type of box but all you have to do is screw in the yellow grip foam part in the middle, and then the other part with the round yellow tip for the top...and that's it, you have yourself a sturdy, full-size broom! It doesn't come with instructions but is pretty easy to figure out. You may find that some bristles are longer than others but all you have to do is trim them with scissors to make it uniform in bristle size. There may also be bits of little stray bristles after sweeping but that is normal for this type of broom. It is really a good broom and it cleans well, especially to clean the dust out of rugs and perhaps even carpeting. No complaints here!!",
