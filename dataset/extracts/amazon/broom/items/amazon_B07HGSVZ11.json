I have a roomba that gets most things, so really I just use it for a quick spill or trash or to get the corners the roomba didn't get. I like that my back doesn't hurt trying to sweep and use the dustpan at the same time close to the floor, like I used to have to do with my old one. The poles are light and seem like they aren't that sturdy, so maybe not the best if you're going to use it extensively, but for my purposes I like that they are light and easy to use for quick sweeps!",
