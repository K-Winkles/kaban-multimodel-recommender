                "reviewText": "It was very easy to assemble, and seems to be sturdy. But the bristles aren't heavy duty so they don't do the job I bought it for, and the overall broom is not light weight. Will be a nice broom for sweeping the sidewalk, but isn't going to pull its weight sweeping things off the side of the house or anything heavy duty on the ground.",
