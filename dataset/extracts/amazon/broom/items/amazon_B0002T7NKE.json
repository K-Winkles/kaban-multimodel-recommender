                "reviewText": "Broom itself is great, high quality. There are stiff bristles inside and soft bristles outside, making it suitable for a variety of surfaces. The tag says it has a 5 year warranty, which is awesome. There are tabs on the broom so the handle can snap in for transport. Unfortunately it didn't include instructions for attaching the handle. You'd think it would be a simple matter of screwing it in, but not quite. Finally I figured out the trick - I screwing it in partially from the opposite end - yes, in through the bristles - to help the threads get started. Then I unscrewed it and reinserted it from the correct end, this time pressing really hard while screwing it in. You have to press the handle in really hard while twisting it, to get the threads to start going in. Then continue screwing it in all the way. The result it worth the effort - the handle attached very securely with absolutely no wiggle-room. Awesome product in the end. Unfortunately the broom got very dirty just a few minutes later, but my floor is nice and clean haha!",
