This works so well on our carpet and helps to save my vacuum; I use this then I vacuum.

You too will wonder why you did not get it sooner.",

                "reviewText": "I have a Great Pyrenees and to make matters worse, I live in Florida! That means Pyr Glitter (aka dog hair) is a daily managed thing in my house. For those unfamiliar with the breed, they are a cold weather mountain dog with a double coat. Rubber brooms and brushes are a must if you have dogs with double coats.This hand brush is the best! I have 5 or 6 different rubber brushes around my house to easily take dog hair off not just clothing but rugs, beds, blankets, walls, and pretty much anywhere you can think of that gets dust and dog hair. The design of this hand brush is superior and more effective than all my others. I would buy several of these hand brushes if they were sold separately from the broom as they are that effective.The broom head is awesome but the handle is a PIA. It comes loose when I am sweeping EVERY time. At least it used to before I used some chromed metal tape ( used for A/C ) to secure the screw in mount of the broom handle.I have two Pet vacuums: a Dyson Pet and a Shark Pet. Even after running these as designed on both my hardwoods and my rugs/ carpets the rubber broom and or the brush still manages to pull remaining dog hair. Oh... and these vacuums are the best I've used for pet hair but that's a separate discussion.JUST BUY THIS broom & brush, you will not regret it!",

Thought ok well I'll lose one segment it'll still have some height, wrong. The ends taper down in size as you near the head. So it's max length or the break your back hunched over mini length. Brush head is great, handle is a piece of crap",
