The bristles are very flexible and easy on my hands and arms. I saw one star reviewers stating that handle comes part. You MUST tighten each section very tightly.

The joints sometimes loosen a bit (or they do for me -- maybe if you are stronger you can tighten them better) but you just retighten them periodically and it's not an issue. My only real complaint is that it's quite heavy - heavier than average for a broom - which I feel like slows me down a bit when sweeping. The weight is in the head so you can't just take a part of the handle out to make it lighter either (tried that). It's also not suitable for tough outdoor sweeping - it's quite soft.",
