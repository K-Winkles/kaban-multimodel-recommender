The broom bristles don\u2019t catch the little stuff. Plus the head of the broom tilts, I thought it would be a neat feature for getting corners, but it\u2019s not because the head doesn\u2019t lock into position and it will tilt when you don\u2019t want or need it to tilt.The bucket is also a flawed design.Look for better, go play with the options at your local store, you will find a better broom and bucket. If the price is better online, find that exact one from the store to order.I don\u2019t suggest this product",

                "reviewText": "Works excellently for cleaning up heaps of pet hair, I love that I'm not having to grab all the loose animal hair off the bristles when my dog is blowing his coat. I'm not sure what other reviewers mean by heavy work, but is great for daily sweeping on hardwood floors, plus the pan holds a good amount and doesn't let it flip out of the pan because it's a covered shape, so you don't have to constantly dump the pan to resume sweeping. The broom part is somewhat narrow, but tbh that's not really been an issue for me.",
