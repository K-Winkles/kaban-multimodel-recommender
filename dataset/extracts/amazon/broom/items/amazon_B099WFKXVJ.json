For year, I had a different upright one with a handle, but sadly, it met its end of life and they no longer make it. I spent quite a bit of time searching for a new one. I bought this one and another one to compare the two and this JEHONN product is SUPERIOR.First, let's talk about ease of installation. The instructions are easy and the parts are interchangeable unlike the other comparison set.It is made well, durable, and the rotating broom allows me to get into those pesky kitchen baseboard corners.Finally, unlike other products I have purchased on Amazon, the company actually thanks you for purchasing their product, which seems to be a rarity these days.If you suffer from any kind of body ailment and need a solid broom/dustpan, I highly recommend this product",

It sits perfectly flat on my tile flooring at work and sweeping the extremely fine dust that we have is a breeze. You know how when your sweeping and you try super hard to just get that last line of dust into the pan but you give up and move the pan back a little bit and try to fling it in. I had no issue with this no re adjust just everything went into the pan. If this thing lasts me 2 years I'll be happy and will gladly buy another as long as they don't change anything.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ll tell you right up front what I like about this dustpan:1) the edge/lip of the dustpan makes good contact with the floor and doesn\u2019t require a lot of re-sweeping to get the dirt pile into the pan.2) the top of the dustpan has a comb that strains the hair, fuzz, threads, grass, and other items from the bristles of the broom. What you sweep in stays in, because you comb it out. No more reaching down and pulling stuff out of the broom. No more dirty hands.3) the pan and the broom hang together as a unit4) the various color schemes are actually nicely thought-out.5) it\u2019s lightweight but feels sturdy. Time will tell if it holds up. It also feels a little cheap.What I don\u2019t like about it:The broom is hard to manage. Needs better grips along the handle. Probably should be an angled-broom, but just having a better grip would be nice.Overall, the broom and pan are well engineered. It\u2019s a good buy, and the dustpan works better than any I\u2019ve used, including Rubbermaid\u2019s. The comb for the broom is so simple, but why didn\u2019t anyone else do it until now?",

                "reviewText": "as brooms go, it serves its purpose...but 1:the bristles are too \"soft\" and as such sweeping on wood floors that are uneven is a chore. it can't grab the scraps well enough without multiple passes. 2: the swivel head i originally thought would be an asset...it is not. mainly because it swivels when you don't want it to. unless you sweep exactly straight, the head will turn and you must reach down and continually adjust it back. 3: the \"adjustable length\" is not truly \"adjustable.\" the handle has multiple sections you screw together and the choice to leave off a section for the height. as a taller woman i thought this would be nice and to an extent it is...if it functioned properly that is. sadly it doesn't for while sweeping the sections come loose and the handle falls apart in your hands. very annoying to say the least. i will give credit to the dust bin for it does have a decent space to hold debris and seams to the floor pretty well so the debris goes easily inside. second good point is the dust bin handle has a clip to attach the broom to it for easy storage. overall for the price i guess i got what i paid for and it works good enough for an inside only quick small clean up tool. anything more, i would recommend a different broom set.",

But if you are getting this just to pick up the minor things that get on the floor, this is the broom for you.It handles very fine dust amazingly, much better than the other brooms can handle. It is much easier to sweep the dust into the pan with the soft bristles than the hard ones.They both have their place and needed, but anything that I sweep up with the heavy broom, this some comes in to put it in the dustpan.and the extra feature on the dustpan to take hair or whatever gets stuck is equally amazing.",
