                "reviewText": "I have hardwood flooring in my house along with three large dogs. Needless to say, there is always dog hair on the floor. I\u2019ve been sweeping and vacuuming daily, but I always find more the second I\u2019m finished. This squeegee broom does better than the stick vac or broom. The rubber edge of the broom slides across the floor, giving no room for any hair to escape its path. It moves all the hair, as well as dust and dirt, right into my dustpan.To test it and prove to myself it\u2019s working better, I used the broom one day, then mopped. On the second day, I used the squeegee broom. On both days, I emptied the mop water in the sink to see how much hair would be in the sink strainer. There was less hair on the second day.I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever going to be a solution that\u2019ll get rid of all loose dog hair, but this squeegee broom definitely does a better job than my regular bristled broom. The only downside is the squeegee broom isn\u2019t flexible. It won\u2019t go into tighter places and I can\u2019t use it to dust baseboards as I do with the broom.Overall, I like the squeegee broom for getting up dog hair. I got to use it on a spill the other day too, and I loved it for that. It\u2019s a useful addition to my collection of vacs, stick vacs, and brooms.",

                "reviewText": "I love this broom. I have two cats and a little dog, so there is always something to sweep up. The cat hair has a tendency to \u201cfly\u201d away from other brooms or dustpans but this broom seems to crab it while sweeping so it stays together when swept up. I like it.I have also swept up pet vomit with this and it worked well. I\u2019m curious if the squeegee blade with hold up getting used on carpet on a regular basis.Assembly, when the product first arrived, was super easy. The pieces all screw together to form the stick/handle. I have even used this on my shower (after taking a few pieces off) to clean the glass stall door.Cleaning the squeegee off is super easy as well. So far, I would highly recommend this, but I would like it in a less bright color.",

                "reviewText": "I got this to help get dog hair out of the carpet. Although it WORKS for that it requires a lot of effort and small movements to get anything additional out of the carpet that the vacuum didn't grab. It's just too much effort for me to do more often than when my inlaws visit.I did end up really liking this for my tile and hardwood floors though. Unlike a traditional broom, this squeegee broom doesn't kick up dust and hair as much. It's a lot easier to control where the dirt and dust pile is going. My grout for my tile isn't really deep either, although if you did have deeper grout you might have issues getting into that area.There's areas of my floor that have caked-on dust because they're just hard to get to. This broom does a pretty good job of almost wiping that off as it goes (likely because it's stiffer than a standard broom).I imagine that it'll be good for glass and mirrors but my house doesn't really have those in areas that are too out of reach for me.Four stars for the price. If it was any more expensive, I would knock this down to three. The build on it feels a bit cheap but it's lightweight and once it's put together it holds up fine (so far).",
