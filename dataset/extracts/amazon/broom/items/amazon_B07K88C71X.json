                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a new broom that effectively solves the issue of hair getting stuck in its bristles, and I couldn't be happier with that aspect. However, the downside is that the bristles are so soft that I find it challenging to effectively sweep up dust and other particles. While it's fantastic for preventing hair entanglement, I wish the bristles had a bit more stiffness to enhance their overall cleaning performance. Despite this drawback, it still serves its primary purpose well.",

It\u2019s a little short. I don\u2019t like to hunch over, it makes me tired. But it works with other brooms as well!! It\u2019s amazing.",
