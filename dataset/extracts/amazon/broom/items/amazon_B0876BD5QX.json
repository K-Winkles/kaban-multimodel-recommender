That one big pile was all over our patio on one side. We have a giant pine tree that is beginning to shed it's old needles and so this is just the beginning of my job.

                "reviewText": "This thing is awful. I guess I didn't have high expectations for a broom that comes in a box. But it's so stiff it's difficult to move across my driveway so it takes way more effort than it should.It leaves behind a lot. You can get some leaves and pine needles, but forget about dirt. It also holds about half of what it sweeps, so after 10 minutes I am just moving around the mass of crap it collected and dropping off bits of it in new places, vs sweeping.It was hard to assemble. Some of the pieces didn't fit well inside of others, despite trying multiple configurations. I wasn't able to do it myself and my husband had to use brute strength to force it together.I would not recommend. Going to invest a little more time and money this time and get a higher quality broom from the home improvement store.",
