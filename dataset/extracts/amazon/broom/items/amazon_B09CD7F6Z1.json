This broom is about 54\", so you won't bend your back, the long broomstick will also allow you to reach every corner and spot, so you can keep your space spotless! Use your strength to screw clockwise to connect the bottom pole and the broom head part until it is tight and no gap.",
            "Our dustpan is about 42.52\" tall, and 12.6\" wide, so you can pick up a lot of garbage at once with the broom.",
            "The width of the broom part is about 13 inch long, so it can sweep a large area at a time. And it has 3 layer bristles which make it more stiff and strong, so it is good at collecting rubbish outdoor like your courtyard garage lobby mall market floor.",
            "Our broom has a protective jacket on its iron pole, it is soft, so you can hold it to sweep, and it will protect your hands when you sweep the floor.",

Not to mention it comes with two brooms and break down into three parts.So I use one on the job, and the other is broke down in the truck for quick sweep outs!I would definitely recommend and buy again.",
