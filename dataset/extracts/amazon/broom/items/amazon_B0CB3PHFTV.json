It is a high-quality broom that is effective at sweeping both indoors and outdoors.The JEHONN broom has a long, extendable handle that can be adjusted which makes it easy to sweep without having to bend over. The broom also has a wide, angled head with four layers of bristles. This design allows the broom to sweep up a variety of debris, including dust, dirt, hair, and even small twigs and rocks.I have been using the JEHONN broom extensively since I first received it in September.I have used it to sweep my porch, patio, and outdoor siding. I have also used it indoors to sweep my kitchen and floors. The broom has performed well in all of these applications. It is easy to assemble, it is very strong, and the price is excellent.I just used it yesterday to sweep snow off of my car.I recommend the JEHONN Outdoor Broom Heavy Duty with 55-inch Long Handle to anyone looking for a high-quality, versatile broom.",

The head is nearly 15-inches wide which means less strokes required.As with many such things these days, the handle comes in threaded sections (which no doubt makes it easier to ship). Once assembled, I don\u2019t want to take it apart again and don\u2019t enjoy the threads coming loose a little as I sweep, so during the original assembly, I put a drop or two of silicone glue onto the threads. Permanent fix.This is a practical, useful broom.",

                "reviewText": "I thought that, will all sections assembled, it would be _longer_ than a standard size, but it doesn't. So, the adjustment (removable sections) is to make it shorter. That can definitely be useful in tight spaces where long handles get in the way or better angles are needed (I am short, with a disability, so use a broom to clean shower walls and tub, for example). In hindsight, it's probably better than what I thought it would be, and I needed a new broom regardless of what I was expecting.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a dedicated broom for sweeping up the floor in the basement around the litter boxes - sometimes the kitties are a bit vigorous when digging around. This broom has slightly stiffer and denser bristles (whether by virtue of being 'heavy duty' or just newer) than our normal kitchen broom, so is very effective for getting the litter out of crevices and corners, litter dust out of rough spots in the cement, etc. Litter has always seemed to require several sweeps over the same spot to get it all (and the kitties can sure track it around); this one gets it all swept up in fewer.The broom comes in several sections which screw together. Assembly was easy and took less than 5 minutes, including unpackaging. The first time I used it some of the sections came loose as I was sweeping, but it turns out I just hadn't tightened them sufficiently. A good hard twist or two and they've remained tight and secure (with no need to retighten) in the few weeks since.I originally thought I would adjust the height (remove a section) when it was my youngest's turn for 'kitty litter duty'. But it's light and maneuverable even at full size so it's worked great from the teenagers to the 10 year-old. The soft, grippy padding on the handle and at the top are nice touches, and the hanging ring keeps it close by, but out of the way.It doesn't do the sweeping for you, nor remind your teenagers to get to it when it's their turn, but otherwise makes it as pleasant as possible.",
