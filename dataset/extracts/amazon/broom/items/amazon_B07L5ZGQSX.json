                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars There's no hole.",
                "reviewText": "As much as I love this thing, I shaved off a star bc I had to drill my own hole and find something to make a loop for it. (I settled on red twine and it actually looks really cute!). While the drilling did achieve the desired result, a hole, the other side splintered a little and I had to sand it a bit to smooth it out. I'm no expert on using a drill so that very well may have been user error on my part but it's kind of a disappointment that I had to do anything to it at all (first-world problems, am I right?). With said sanding though, I must admit, while I took off a little paint, it's still red there so it has that going for it. Okay, now on to the review! (After a short backstory, of course.)I bought this for myself bc my back tends to get sore when I bend over for any length of time and I needed a broom to use on the landing at the bottom of the stairs. I had a little brush and dustpan that I had hanging on the coat rack and that worked okay but it was just getting too hard to bend down to sweep the floor and clean the grooves in the welcome mat. The landing is probably big enough to have a regular sized broom standing in the corner but I've met my dog and the first time I went outside for three seconds he'd knock it over and it would likely pin the door closed against the stairs- the ONLY entrance into my apartment. It would also be in the way when someone goes to hang their coat or umbrella so I knew I didn't want that. Every day I'd look at all the filth and think to myself that I really needed to clean that... but then I had an idea! What if I had a longer broom that I could use AND hang up? And here we are.Besides the whole hole deal (don't get me started again!), it's actually quite perfect! The bristles are nice and stiff so it does a WAY better job at cleaning the grooves in that mat, with MUCH less effort on my part! I wasn't sure it would work as well as a regular broom, since it IS made for kids, but all the glowing reviews convinced me to give it a shot and I'm so glad I did! I looked at several types and really liked the old-timey feel of this style, as well as the shape and bristle material to get those ornery mat grooves! Most of the others I looked at were basically just toys, and cost more than this one! This one is exactly like a regular-sized corn bristle broom, with STRONG reinforced bristle-holdy things, and a solid wood handle- only smaller. I think this guy's gonna last me just fine- but for the price, I don't really care how long it lasts bc I'll just keep buying them- even if I do have to drill more holes! Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Sturdiness: 5/5Durability: 5/5Value for money: 4/5Overall: 5/5Recomend: YesI purchased this broom for my upstairs bathroom. We keep the kitty box up there so the dogs can't get to it, but that means sometimes litter occasionally gets on the floor. I didn't need a full sized broom for the area, but wanted a dedicated broom because I didn't like the thought of the litter broom being used elsewhere in the house. I also didn't want a plastic broom, but something that would biodegrade when it had reached the end of its sweeping days.This little broom is built like a weapon. It is very solid, and feels just as durable as full sized corn brooms I've used before. It reaches all the way under the claw foot tub, and is the right size to reach into tight spaces.My only two gripes are: 1) I feel like this broom being 1/3 the size of a full broom it should be slightly less than 1/2 the cost, but yadda yadda fast shipping and the awkward shape so this is a pointless gripe, I can literally not find this item in my town and 2) the only real complaint is it should have a predrilled hole in the handle so it can be hung. Being meant as a toddler toy, I can understand why it didn't have a hole. To the manufacturer, pretty please make a version with a hole because this little broom is quite handy for us adults.If you're on the fence, buy the broom. I honestly adore this little thing.",
