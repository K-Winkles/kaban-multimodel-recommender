                "reviewText": "I really like this broom and dustpan set. It's exactly what I needed to keep an area clean by our parrot's cage and cat area. It's a smaller sized broom who's bristles are strong enough to gather what a parrot can dish out, the dustpan's teeth takes out fur easily, it stands upright on its own, and it's a beautiful color. For people complaining about it coming loose, when you build it you can use teflon tape wrapped around the threads when you screw it together, and that will keep it from doing that.This is a sturdy set. I think the dustpan could have been slightly smaller in width, matching the broom, but that's fine. I didn't want a heavy large broom and dustpan. I have arthritis and lupus, so I needed something light. This is helping me tremendously. Also, the little matching dustpan set they included is perfect for the table where I draw, getting the mess from erasers and charcoal pencils. I was grateful it matched the broom set, with it's pretty green/blue color. This is one of the best purchases I've made in a while. I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This broom works perfectly. The last broom I had was overly expensive from target and it broke pretty quickly. I\u2019ve just been vacuuming since because I have a dog and a cat and thought sweeping wasn\u2019t effective enough. Wrong! This broom makes sweeping feel very easy and the dust pan that catches dog hair is something beyond helpful. If you\u2019re looking for a good broom this is perfect option. I got the light blue/green color. I almost got the bright green and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. It does kind of seem like it would be flimsy or fall apart and it is not, put together it\u2019s very sturdy. Also the dust pan works really great, this is nerdy but I actually used to work at a movie theater and this works just as good as a normal dust pan. Definitely recommend this broom I am so, so glad I bought it. There are a lot of options and it\u2019s hard to choose but you won\u2019t regret this one. And it definitely screws together tall enough for any adult.",

The product is good if you are small or a child. I\u2019m about 5\u20196 and the broom doesn\u2019t reach my chest. The dust pan doesn\u2019t seal to the floor, so everything just gets swept underneath it which the defeats the purpose for my needs.The bristles of the broom are too soft and so they don\u2019t clean well. The handle of the broom is incredibly flimsy. I lost grip strength due to the broken elbow and shoulder and managed to crush it while I was sweeping. Lifting a 1 lb weight in physical therapy is difficult for me. I shouldn\u2019t be able to just crush this thing with my bare hands.It\u2019s very pretty to use as a toy.",
