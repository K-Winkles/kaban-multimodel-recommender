Each one is just under 6 inches long and about 2.5 inches across.Actual cinnamon brooms are soaked in cinnamon oil and give off such a powerful fragrance that you unwrap them slowly over the course of weeks. These silly trinkets don't even compare. I unwrapped both completely and put them in a 10x10 room. I came back into the room an hour later and it smelled like maybe somebody had a pack of Big Red in their closed purse.An absolute waste of money.",
