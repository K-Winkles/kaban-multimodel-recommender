The only downside i'm seeing, they are a little loose after tightening the pole. You just give it a little twist, not a big deal. I've worked a lot of dirty jobs in my life, and I like that it's lightweight, and has guts where it's needed (the bristles)! If you need a reliable workhorse on a budget, this is a good buy.",

                "reviewText": "I'm loving this broom. It sweeps so much better than the Libman broom I have. The bristles are firm and strong, yet still have the flexibility to get underneath stuff and into the corners. The bristles are very durable and keep their shape. I have other brooms with bristles that have deformed after multiple uses, but this one is keeping its shape very nicely. It's much more efficient at picking up dirt, so I don't have to go back over the floor as many times. The head of it is angled, which helps get in the corners and under the baseboards in my garage. It also works great to sweep the tops of the baseboards in the garage. I think the handle is the best part of the entire broom. It's got 3 extension levels, so you can adjust based on your height and your sweeping needs. I love that you can even use it as a hand broom, once the poles are adjusted. The poles are made of heavy duty metal that's very firm, so they won't bend. The extension attachments are made with thick ABS plastic, so there's no worry about them breaking. The metal poles screw into the attachment for a firm fit. Even though there are multiple extensions there is no give in the pole while using. The handle is larger with a nice comfortable grip. It's even got a hole at the top if you want to hang it for storage. This is a great quality broom and the price is very economical, especially for this high quality of a broom.",

I assume it would be good for someone who needs to take their broom on the go though.The broom does a fine job with cleaning, but my issue is actually the feature that I also liked it for. It seems to get loose and makes the broom less sturdy. It doesn't fall apart, but I find myself constantly tightening it. Since I don't need to use this feature much, I think I would prefer just having a regular broom. Sweeping isn't fun, but its a bit less fun when you have to keep tightening up your loose broom.Overall its a decent broom that gets the job done, I just wouldn't say its the \"strongest,\" as its advertised.",

                "reviewText": "So, I bought this because I get tons of spider webs out on my back yard fences, and I needed something relatively strong and relatively flexible. It works brilliantly but no matter how hard you twist the handle it all comes undone. I am going to have to use super glue to keep it from untwisting. Like others have said it really does start to untwist with hardly any force at all no matter how hard you tighten it.I am not going to need it to come apart since it will not be traveling anywhere with me, and I have plenty of room to store it. Will update once it makes it past a season outside.I did use it to sweep my pavers in the front and it worked really well. I might get another one for out there since it is a pretty decent sweeper. I get rid of my old straw broom... it has very little sweeping power these days. haha.",

The part I don't like is that, maybe because I just am not strong enough, as I'm sweeping away, the parts I've screwed together keep coming loose, so I have to keep tightening them. I figure if I have to I can always glue them.",

                "reviewText": "I was kind of surprised how floppy the bristles on this are. I will often have to sweep over the same area multiple times, as it leaves a decent amount of debris behind. On the plus side, it is fairly durable and I haven\u2019t noticed any wear after a few months of use outside. It does come loose after a while, so you will find yourself having to twist it back it place after almost every sweeping session.",
