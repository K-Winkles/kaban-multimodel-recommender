That\u2019s not going hold much longer. I swear it\u2019s like a curse that your return window ends or you finally review something on here and suddenly it stops working right lol.I love this broom and dust pan set. At first I thought the bristles were too springy but you get used to that and I found it helps the broom to maneuver into tighter spots. The lip of the dust pan has a good \u201cseal\u201d against the floor so dust doesn\u2019t just go under it unless you have uneven floors. I love the toothy part that combs the broom to remove things like hair.I have chronic pain issues and am fatigued VERY easily and this set is so light weight that it doesn\u2019t tire me out and I can very easily sweep even one handed with straining my wrist.You could also make the broom short for shorter people or children to use.",

There was no cushioning material, even though the contents are metal (?) and hard plastic. I was, however, please with the ease of assembly. It took all of one minute. I was afraid that the dustpan wouldn't be loose enough to fall forward when you sent it down, but it is. I'm quite happy about that (and the fact that it is pretty lightweight) because I had bought it for my 79 year old mother-in-law who needed one. She is quite pleased with it as well. We both recomment this if you're in the market for a dustpan/broom combo like this.",

                "reviewText": "Edited - if anyone else had this problem. I was able to fix the dustpan by putting a brick on it for a couple of days. It is now straight as an arrow again and I was able to use it today. Not sure if it will warp again, but at least I don't need to throw it in the trash. Upgraded stars from 1 to 3.Bought this to sweep up in my garage and shed. Had it hanging on a wall for about a year. Only used it a handful of times. I went to use it today and the dustpan had warped (bending away from the floor) by a couple centimeters. So now when you try to sweep anything into the dustpan it just goes underneath. I tried pushing hard on the dustpan handle when sweeping to try to eliminate the warp, but it doesn't work. We have a couple dustpans in our house that we have literally had for decades that still are straight. It could be the plastic on this one is too thin, or just not very good quality.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased specifically this set because I read an article that was rating and trying out different brooms and I wanted something efficient for my new apartment, this one was the best rated out of the ones they tried, so I went ahead and purchased it without reading many reviews, since I needed the fast 1 day delivery, it arrived fast the next morning exactly when I needed it (thank you amazon team). When I saw the box it came in my first thought is it was tiny, and somehow when I opened it and saw the broom head it managed to be tinier than I expected ( literally the size of my hand from my pinky to my thumb and I have small hands) if I had to guess the size I would say about 7 inches long. Technically it looks like a play broom for children, though the handle is nice and long. But I do have to say that the quality of it and how it feels its outstanding it feels very well made, and the dustpan does too so for this reason I really will give it a try since my new apartment its tiny I guess it goes with the vibe.The apartment was super super dusty and even though the wood floors are textured the broom proved effective, the dustpan definitely my favorite dustpan ever the broom needs a little getting used to because it is a little bouncy and makes a bit of an unsatisfying sound but did the job great, I did notice though that in the bathroom floor that is stone/tiles that was super dusty too it didn\u2019t work as good like it did on the wood I had to keep going over and over and when I went to mop it hadn\u2019t picked everything up so the mop ended up doing most of the work there, so definitely keep that in mind if you have tiles (also keep in mind that my apartment was just built so the dust was not the regular day to day dust/dirt houses usually collect, but more of a cement powder kind of thing)Overall I do not regret buying this one but if I could go back I would not hesitate to try a different one. Pros: the small brush was able to get in all the little spaces, the handle is nice and long, it feels sturdy and high end since its metal, its nice quality, biggest pro: The dustpan, with the hair comb and the quality of it loveeee itCons: the brush is smaller than average brooms lol, the metal pole makes it a bit heavier but I didn\u2019t find it an issue at all but I definitely did have to use both hands and be firm with it.",

                "reviewText": "This broom arrived in a box and was super easy to assemble, no extra tools were required, simply put the pieces together. I love how the broom can be stored upright with the fastener on the dustpan handle, saving the brittles from being damaged while standing directly on the floor. The upright dustpan saves you from bending over with traditional dustpans and it has a little rubber lip that offers a better seal to the floor for easier sweeping up of small particles. The bristles are rigid enough to sweep up our entrance carpet when I don't necessarily want to pull out the whole vacuum. The dustpan has these hard plastic built-in teeth that you use to brush off the broom bristtles which works really well for the pet hair from our cat and dog that get entangles in the bristles. Well made and good design.",

                "reviewText": "I'll admit that the majority of brooms around my home tend to be dollar store junk, but they work.I honestly wasn't expecting much out of this broom and dustpan, since \"a broom is a broom\", right? Wrong.While the broom handle requires some very minor assembly (screwing in the poles), it's ready to go in seconds after that's done.The dustpan is already assembled and can flip out when required.It does *not* stand upright on its own when folded, unless you're leaning it against something or have the dustpan in the open position. You can hang it on a broom rack or even by a hook since it has hook holes at the top of each handle.The broom and dustpan connect to each other when not in use, so they don't need to be managed separately.Both the dustpan and broom are very well-made, and this surprised me since I was not expecting that! The bristles on the broom are thick, but work well. The thickness should make them more durable, as I've had thinner bristles become \u201cfuzzy\u201d over time.One killer feature is the comb on the dustpan. This allows you to remove any trapped hair or fur from the bristles as you sweep dirt into the dust pan.I will say that living in a house with pets tends to make sweeping more work because hair and fur tends to get tangled up and trapped in most broom bristles \u2013 not with this one! I can sweep fur all day, and the broom looks immaculate once I'm done.The lip of the dustpan is also tapered well, and I find it allows me to sweep up dust without doing the shuffle back and sweep.Even at a price that I'd consider expensive ($39 at the time of this review), I would completely recommend this set.",

Although a discount/coupon would be nice to see, it may not be entirely necessary unless for a competitive edge. Fairly priced at average market going rate.I own an identical unit to this in white, and what\u2019s looking more and more to be one of those universally sold items across here on Amazon between various sellers/vendors.ADDITIONAL NOTESFor this particular type of design/model, the pricing is fair and well on point with the market going rate. I own another set but in different color. These appear to be one of those universally sold items across various sellers/vendors here on Amazon, as such, be sure to shop around for the best pricing you could get your hands on.The sizing is great - about average sized and what you would expect. It comes with a convenient clip to attach the broom to the dustpan when stored away or not in use. Alternatively, both items also have a hanging hole built into the top cap of the pole - the cap rotates a full 360 degree without the pole needed turn along with it. If you plan to hang this unit, the dustpan folds up on itself allowing for proper storage.Quality is decent and much like you would expect. It isn\u2019t cheap/thin plastic material, but reasonably thick and I imagine it\u2019ll last a long time with the proper care.Best standout feature is the protruding \u201cteeth\u201d sticking out of the dustpan. What a great idea as it catches hair, lint, and all that other stuff with the simple flick of a brush. Don\u2019t you hate it when those types of annoyances get stuck on the brush?",
