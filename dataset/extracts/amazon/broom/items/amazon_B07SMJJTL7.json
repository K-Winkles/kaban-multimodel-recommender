                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Don't buy the Dyson, this is so much more affordable and works great - even if you have pet hair!",
                "reviewText": "Ok, I am not normally a review writer. In fact, I probably purchase 20 things off Amazon each month, for years, and have only written 2 reviews to complain. I looked and looked at reviews of several stick vacs before picking this one. I have a Dyson that is great for my carpets, but we now have laminate flooring throughout the house (dark laminate) that shows every hair, fuzz, speck, leaf, .....you get the picture. It made me crazy to see the dust and hair on the floor when the light came through the windows. I needed something I could grab, quickly, and go through the house and a broom wasn't cutting it. This was EXACTLY what I was looking for!!! For reference, I have three long haired cats and a German shepherd. We have lots of hair. I have two teenage daughters with lots of hair, AND.....we live out on property with lots of dust and dirt that comes in with us from the barn. I am so happy with this vac and I'm even more happy I tried this first and didn't pay for a Dyson. I thought, \"I'll try this for a lower price and hope for the best!\" I'm so glad I did.The PROS: super light weight (I think like 5 lbs all together and 3 if you are using it as a handheld vac), battery lasts me two or three full uses around the whole house (my house is 1000 sq. ft. for reference - only throw rugs and no wall-to-wall carpet) before needing a charge. Works great on throw rugs, although you have to hold the corner of the rug down so it doesn't suck it up. Has a light that shows dirt in hard to reach places, lies flat to go right under the coffee table, easy to get on the sides of toilets in the bathroom, head comes off fast to do quick spider webs in the corners, has two attachments that are quick on and off and easy to use in corners. Has a nice hang up attachment and doesn't take up too much space. Super easy to dump the cannister and isn't messy like my Dyson. In fact, I ALWAYS managed to get some of the dust out on the floor when emptying my Dyson. NEVER have that problem with this little vac. Great at getting fine dust and pet hair. Just discovered, yesterday, how much I love making it into a little vac. If you take off the stick and the roller attachment that goes on the floor, and attach one of the corner attachments, it becomes a hand vac with good suction. I ran all over the house sucking behind couch cushions, around lamps, the cracks in my office chair........I seriously WANT to vacuum with this thing and with no cords it is so easy. Oh, and it's quiet enough to actually vac while I'm simultaneously on a phone call...LOVE THAT! It will also pick up cat litter and the big kind from the \"Breeze\" system that looks like pellets.CONS: Since we have a lot of hair, every 3rd or 4th time I use it, I grab some scissors and get the hair off the roller (this is something I really should have been doing with my Dyson too in all actuality). If you do it often, it is easy and quick and keeps the roller working great! Doesn't sit up on it's own if you have to set it down for a minute. You have to lean it up on something. That is a little annoying, but not a deal breaker in light of all the Pros. Doesn't suck like my Dyson, but I have not found anything left behind.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for my mom whose Shark recently stopped working. Turned out to be a blessing in disguise considering the Shark had long been too heavy for her to manage comfortably. While I knew that she needed something more lightweight, I was also hoping to find something cordless so that vacuuming the stairs wouldn't pose such a nightmare for her. Going in, I guess I was ready to accept that, with these caveats as priority considerations, it would almost certainly mean having to compromise on overall performance. There was also the uncertainty regarding runtime of a rechargeable battery. Would this mean having to re-charge the battery more than once to finish vacuuming the house? A lot to consider, but after some research, and taking into consideration the reviews for this machine, I decided to give the Eureka a try.While I couldn't be absolutely sure without mom actually giving it a go herself, I was at least hopeful that it would be lightweight enough for her to use. And, because it is cordless, I figured she'd be much more comfortable trying to maneuver it around the house. Also, while I still wasn't sure what to expect in terms of how long the vacuum could run before having to recharge it, the Eureka had enough positive reviews that I felt reasonably confident that it would meet most of my general criteria.As it turns out, it most definitely is lightweight enough for my mom to maneuver around her house and the fact that it doesn't have a cord makes it even more so. I don't know what I expected in terms of its suction, but I was blown away at how well it picks up from hardwood, tile, and carpeted floors. Way better than the Shark, even! I watched my mom pretty much breeze through the kitchen, dining room, and family room with no problems at all. The stairs, which had always been a problem for her, were vacuumed with relative ease and with much better results than before, due not just to the machine being cordless and lightweight, but also due to less bulkiness of the machine itself. You can get into those corners and along the wall much more tightly than with a larger machine.The tools that come with are simple to use; the brush, crevice tool, extension, and vacuum head are all she really needs. Was a bit concerned about her ability to switch them out, since she has severe arthritis in her hands. But the large buttons that you press to swap them out made it much easier for my mom to manipulate once she got the hang of it.As far as runtime, that turned out not to be an issue at all. This thing can easily do all of the main floor, plus the downstairs of her house and still have some charge left over for quick pick-ups later. Part of this, I think, may be because you don't have to go over and over certain areas of the floor to get it completely vacuumed. The suction in this machine is so efficient, the time it takes to do the vacuuming is far less than it used to be. Now, it's just zip, zip and you're done. That being said, If I had to guess, I'd say a fully charged battery will allow this vacuum to run somewhere around 45 minutes, maybe even a bit longer, before needing to be re-charged. It does have helpful indicator lights, though, to keep you mindful of how much charge you have left just in case you lose track.Couldn't be happier with this Eureka, in fact I'm considering purchasing one for myself. Compared to dragging around a far heavier and corded machine that has a much harder time switching between hard floors and carpet efficiently, the Eureka is a dream to use and does a far better job at actually cleaning than I would ever before have hoped for or imagined.",

                "reviewText": "I actually like this little guy. Light weight, easy to maneuver and get under couches, beds, kitchen and end tables. All the attachments are simple & easy use, including the dust bin. I have a two bedroom apartment and the battery lasts long enough to do it all and there's no dust or debris kickback on the linoleum floors.But, the compartment that holds the dust is about 1 cup in size. Very, very small. I have to empty it each time before I move on to another room. I have two teenage boys, two dogs, a cat and I have incredibly long hair so it fills up fast. It definitely doesn't have enough suction for me to feel like I got a good clean. Some of the smaller items you can get with a regular powered vacuum (say like a small piece of a candy wrapper) will not pick up. That's about all you find in a teenagers room, so not fun.The problem with the long hair is that it winds up in the bristles before it can be sucked up the tube so I have to clean it every, single time (literally have to cut it out, takes about 5+ minutes) because if you don't, it covers the bristles and because the suction on it may be a little more than what you get from a dust buster, it will not pick ANYTHING up. The hair also winds up in the gears causing the bristles to jam. I've used it maybe 10 times and already had to tear it apart twice to clean out the hair. (About 10+ minutes)Time saver? No. Good suction power? No. Lightweight and easy? Yes. Decent battery and easy attachments. Yes. Worth the trouble and money? No.I'm keeping it because I have health issues and its so lightweight that with the attachments I can get corners and cobwebs easily and with very little pain.This is my 3rd attempt at purchasing a decent vacuum, I've just decided that a good vacuum is not going to be found on line.",

Easy to clean, quiet, light and can become a smaller vacuum for my toddler to help, because for her vacuuming is fun! I didn't want to spend much for a cordless Dyson, so started searching for an alternative. This was the first time I heard about this brand and I would highly recommend. Battery lasts about 30 min and I can clean almost two floors if I am efficient. Carpet cleaning is not the best but it still does a light cleaning job for everyday use until I bring out my Dyson tank vacuum that I started hating because of its weight. I think it is a great option and I always reach out for it when I need to quickly clean dust on the hardwood or crumbs around the table.",
