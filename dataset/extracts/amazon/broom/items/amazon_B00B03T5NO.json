It is a fairly sturdy little broom that is the perfect size for her. It also seems like it would be handy to try to sweep out narrow places.I had hoped the corn bristles would have been a little stiffer, but they bend a little more than I would want which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5... but again, this turned in to the play broom for my 4 year old and she is delighted with it.",
