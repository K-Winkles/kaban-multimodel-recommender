The only thing I think I\u2019d keep it for is the microfibre cloth that helps get under furniture on my hardwood floor. It definitely loosens the hair but doesn\u2019t clump up like I wish it showed in the pictures. Definitely a workout but I don\u2019t mind that. It does squeegee pretty good though too. It probably does good on longer carpet for sure.",

It picks up everything. A hole was recently drilled into the wall leaving drywall dust on the ground (fine & powdery) and it swept it all clean! I was so excited at the versatility & efficiency of this design I was sent into a cleaning frenzy! After I was done sweeping, I attached a rag around the \u2018broom\u2019 part and suddenly it was transformed into the best mop I could have asked for. It is collapsible and would fit in a shoulder bag/ backpack easily and is so great for travel. Especially if you like to clean up after yourself/ travel with pets. I even \u2018swept\u2019 a blanket my dog lays on every day- AND IT WORKED! I imagine it would be good for cleaning windows too, I intend to try that next...",

                "reviewText": "\u25aa\ufe0fType of carpet used on: typical, average pile carpet\u25aa\ufe0fHeres what I like first: The handle is easy to assemble and is \"short people\" friendly, I am average height but I have family who isn't but the handle is in segments and leaving one out doesn't affect the usability. I also like that it fluffs up the carpet and pulls up some of that stuff that gets settled in the carpet fibers which helps the vacuum gets more stuff and makes the carpet appear vacuumed (in case you have company call and say they are just up the road and you have no time to vacuum). It's also lightweight and easy to clean. It's also easy to store.\u25aa\ufe0fNow on to my other thoughts on this item: We have two cats plus my hubby and I both have long hair. We all shed, so I thought I'd try to help the vacuum out (I have an pet hair vac that works great but want to prolong its life) by removing some of the surface hair and pulling up some of the buried litter and dirt. I am not sure this thing works as well unless you have low pile carpet AND pets who shed a lot like long haired floofy cats or pomeranians or similar that have softer, less corse hair. I don't think it works as well with hair/fur that is more corse. It works great for pulling litter out of the carpet fibers and other dirt that is down in there, and it works great to fluff the carpet fibers to make it look \"new\". It does remove hair, so to say it doesn't work at all is not accurate. But it depends on the type of coat your pets have and how much they shed.\u25aa\ufe0fAs for the sturdiness of it? It's ok, as long as you are just using a gentle pulling motion, but if you use it like you are raking gravel, it's not going to work right and the handle is likely to bend if not break.",
