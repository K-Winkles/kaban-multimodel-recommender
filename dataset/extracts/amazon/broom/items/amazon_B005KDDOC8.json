The edge of the first one had broken in places. I ordered this one from Amazon to replace it. It is wonderful and very well constructed! It is so sturdy that it evens stands by itself for me to sweep dirt into. The pan itself is also better. With the 1st one, things would fall off. With the new one, the pan is actually a scoop, so it catches everything. I love it!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Wow. The Rubbermaid brand used to mean you were buying the best. Sturdy, durable and quality made. Not so anymore. This dustpan is advertised as \"executive \" and \"commercial\". Any executive as dysfunctional as this dustpan is would be quickly swept up and chucked into the trash bin. Commercial use literally implies that it is very strong, durable and intended for all day use. This dustpan is quite flimsy. I explain my opinions below.My dustpan arrived in a seriously warped condition. When it is placed on level smooth ground, the leading edge of the pan only contacts the surface at the corners. The center is about 5/16's of an inch above the surface. Therefore you can't even sweep all your material up! If you try the push the pan down, the gap lifts up and opens up even more. Basically, it's unusable on hard surfaces like on linoleum, concrete or hardwood floors. It would be at home sweeping up trash on a sandy beach, or cleaning up a few leaves out of your dirt garden. Refer to images and video.This is a very light weight dustpan. Flimsy comes to mind. The metal handle screws into the yoke, which is then attached to the body of the dustpan. At the end of the hollow metal handle, a plastic male screw is attached. This is so the handle can screw into the yoke. That \"screw\" is held onto the shaft by a series of dents in the shaft. That junction is loose. That \"screw\", then screws into a threaded, split piece of plastic. That threaded piece of split plastic, is then shoved into the yoke and held in place by a pair of tiny tongue-in-groove like junctions. That junction is also loose. In all, it is very lose and weak handle to yoke attachment. Flimsy is how I would describe this dustpan. To call it a commercial product is offensive to me. The word deceptive comes to mind.I chose to use this so called commercial dustpan in our dirt garden area where it isn't critical how well it actually cleans debris up. Maybe sweeping up a few leaves off a loose dirt surface will be all its good for. I was unwilling to waste my time to bother returning it. That would be a further waste of cardboard and shipping costs. Hopefully yours will be a good one.",

                "reviewText": "Overall the dustpan is well made and stores nicely with the fold up pan, but, my only complaint is that it should have a rubber edge to pick up fine particulate dirt. There is a gap between the floor surface and the pans leading edge making it impossible to sweep all the dirt into the pan. It takes several passes to get the dirt into the pan and a soft rubber edge would fix this problem.",
