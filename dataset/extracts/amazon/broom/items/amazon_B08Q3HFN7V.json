Now consider I do vacuum and shampoo my carpets often, but I also have 2 cats with very long hair. Also have 2 large standard poodles however, they are purebreds so they don't shed.So I guess by all rights the rubber brush for carpet does work.I gave it only 4 stars because the handle/pole feels flimsy to the point that my husband is afraid he will break it and I don't want to put much force behind it.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using rubber brooms like this for 20+ years. They're great for wooden floors and last ages. But eventually the rubber around where the brush joins the handle will deteriorate and the broom becomes useless. I ordered this and another version, this one was slightly more expensive. It has a very thick brush head, which I'm not entirely sure improves the product because it makes it heavier and I don't feel it gathers any more debris. But mostly, I can't deal with the really short handle. I'm not tall, but have to bend too much to get a good sweep, the other broom I also ordered has a handle that is 11 inches longer and is just right (it's a lot lighter too, which I prefer).",
