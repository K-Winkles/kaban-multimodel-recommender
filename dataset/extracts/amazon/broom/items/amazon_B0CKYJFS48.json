It smoothly gathers debris\u2014wet or dry\u2014from my floors, scrapes up dust that I didn\u2019t even know was there, fits into corners and under furniture, plus I don\u2019t have to constantly change pads. Way better than an old fashioned bristle broom on smooth surfaces, but on tiled floors I noticed it tends to skim over grout lines, leaving a few crumbs behind. Although my back appreciates the extra long handle, it could be a bit sturdier, as it sometimes gives under pressure. Also, I\u2019m not sure how to replace the silicone strip that I know will wear away and disintegrate over time. But for right now, I\u2019m impressed",

                "reviewText": "Now this is a really cool \"broom\" - more like a squeegee, in fact, which makes it great for cement floors like in the garage or basement. It can be adjusted to fit pushers of various heights - just add or remove one of the two poles to make it the height that's most comfortable for you. The rubber tread on the bottom will scoop up even tiny bits that tend to cling stubbornly to the floor and won't scratch floor surfaces. I will say that it's extremely lightweight - nice in one respect, but it makes me a little concerned about how long it will last (I've told my hubby to go easy when he's doing the sweeping up).",

I don\u2019t like brooms with bristles which is another reason I got this, and I\u2019m so happy with the job it did. It\u2019s like a squeegee for the floors, all the dust, particles and crumbs swept up so easily, along with the dust under the bed. So wonderful on the hardwoods and I was then able to mop easily. A great choice for all the sweeping!",
