                "reviewText": "Purchased this because I needed something that is compact/folds down since I like to minimize things. So this fits nicely in the small space between my fridge and wall (I use magnetic hooks to hang them on the side of the fridge) so it is out of sight. The dustpan is great, and honestly I purchased this mainly for the dustpan. The broom is not practical as it swivels to the sides which is great when you want to store the broom but not effective when you're sweeping because it keeps swiveling which makes it difficult to sweep.Deducted one star for the impractical/lack of effectiveness for the broom which is generous considering I purchased this mainly for the dustpan. But for those who need both broom and dustpan, I would not recommend since the broom is not very functional.Durability wise, it's pretty good for the cost. Lightweight and more durable than most for the price point.",
