Broombi was designed to be used indoors and we made it lightweight and easy to use for everyone, yet sturdy enough to tackle most cleaning jobs without putting stress on your arms or back. In fact, Broombi is more efficient with gentle strokes. What's the best way to use Broombi? Broombi is an efficient indoor broom and works best with light, gentle strokes. There is no need to use excessive force when sweeping. Use longer strokes on smooth floors and shorter strokes on carpet and rugs. Are there any precautions? Do not store Broombi upright on the broom head as this may cause the blade to curl and may damage the blade. Instead, lay it flat or hang it on a hook. Also, for best results, rinse it clean after each use. Finally, do not use Broombi outdoors. Do you sell replacement broom heads? Yes, we sell replacement broom heads. However, our broom heads are made specifically for use with the Broombi pole and will not work with other types of poles, so you need to purchase the Broombi first. Can this replace my conventional broom? Yes, in fact, unlike conventional brooms, Broombi has no bristles and can easily be rinsed clean after each use. No more pulling hair and dirt out of dirty bristles makes life easier and means a cleaner and more hygienic household.",

                "reviewText": "I had high hopes for this broom - I have 3 labradors, I sweep my whole house (laminate floors) twice a week. I currently use a nylon angle broom. The Broombi is ok, but I will be keeping my old broom.The good:Yes, it sweeps. And yes it picks up the dog hair into neat lines on the floor that don't fly all over the place due to (1) the static electricity it claims to have, plus (2) the open grid design. It's also lightweight - not necessary, but a plus. Finally, it's easy to clean - just rinse it with water.The bad:I have a tight area (6\" wide) between a wall and a cabinet that is too narrow for this broom. My old broom gets at it fine, however! Also, you have to hang this on a hook or other organizer that keeps the broom off the floor. I already have this, but not everyone does. I already nicked the head on something while sweeping the floor. I'm not sure how or when that happened, but it's damaged after the first use. We often get fine dirt/granite particles tracked into the house. Finally, this is not at all for outdoor use. My current broom can do both.",

It\u2019s really annoying for me to move while cleaning, which means dog fluff, dirt, crumbs, and toys get stuck under there to until the next time I can get a second pair of hands to move it. And who wants to look at all that through their coffee table? \ud83d\ude48Somehow I found this broom & it is EXACTLY what I needed. Very skinny/low profile, so it fits under the table/shelf & drags the dust and fluff and crumbs right out!You do need to keep moving the broom to keep everything from being left behind (hence the elbow grease), but it\u2019s easy enough & so worth it! 10 out of 10!",
