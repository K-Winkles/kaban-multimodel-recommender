                "reviewText": "I like these handheld dust pans for cleaning small messes, and I've been unhappy with both my Libman and O-Cedar brand ones. The Libman one has a brush that shaped like a paint brush, and it's inefficient for sweeping under furniture or around corners. The O-Cedar brush handle falls off the brush head, and needs to be glued. Neither of them properly lock the brush onto the pan for hanging storage, despite supposedly being able to.I chose this set in hopes of upgrading my other two, but it unfortunately also leaves something to be desired.I find the brush optimal for my purposes in that it's shaped to my liking- the bristles are stiff and easy to clean against the serrated edge of the dust pan, it clips securely into the dust pan, and so far no bristles have come loose on me.However the dust pan is one of the worst I've ever used. It's thin and easily bent, and it's malformed. The pan domes upwards in the middle, the outer edge to sweep into bows upwards and doesn't fully meet the floor unless I press hard on it. Since the pan is so easily bent, pressing down hard on it will make the edge fully meet with the floors. However this still leaves the problem of the pan's interior being warped and preventing dust, dirt, and whatever else dirtying up the floors from being effectively swept into the pan and staying inside while sweeping.If the pan issue were to be fixed, I would be satisfied with this set.CleanAide Snap On Dust Pan & Broom Kit, Blue & White, 2 Pieces",
