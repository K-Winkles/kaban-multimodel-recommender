                "reviewText": "There are few things I liked and disliked about this broom. Even though it was easy to assemble, it lacks some things that to me are important such as better hair material and softness and more sturdy handle material.The stiff bristles on the broom are what save it. They clean up trash, leaves, and other debris from a variety of outdoor areas well. The 20-inch width gives it good coverage, so it can be used in driveways, patios, and other big areas. The 51-inch handle isn't great or bad. On the one hand, it's useful for getting to faraway places without having to bend too far. That being said, the material feels a little weak. I've seen some bending happen when I sweep more vigorously, which makes me worry about how long it will last overall. Also, the broom hair is pretty stiff and isn't good for picking up small trash or cleaning inside.Unfortunately, the fact that the broom is so light is a big problem. Even though it makes it easy to move, it makes me wonder how long it will last. It doesn't feel as strong as I'd like for heavy-duty use outside, especially in industrial places or on surfaces like stone or wood.In conclusion, the Heavy Duty Outdoor Angle Broom is a good choice for basic cleaning jobs outside. It has stiff bristles and a handle that is pretty long to make it easier to use. But I can't give it a better grade because it's too light and I'm not sure how long it will last. Heavy-duty outdoor cleaning might require a more durable design.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This broom is very lightweight, which has its benefits and drawbacks. It was super easy to assemble and the light weight makes it easy to transport. It does feel a bit flimsy due to the weight and quality of the bristles. The bristles look like they are plastic maybe. The handle has had a tendency to loosen up a bit. And starts to twist. It\u2019s easy to just tighten it by twisting the handle again. This broom is obviously made for bigger areas. It didn\u2019t work well on my steps as it was too large for the width of the stairs. I included a video of us sweeping up pine needles. It worked well for that. It is also easy to clean.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a broom to sweep my deck because the width on my house broom is too narrow. I really like the width of this broom, but that's about it. The metal handle pieces are very thin, cheapy aluminum, which okay. Easy to put together but make sure you really twist the pieces tight! Even if you do, what annoyed me was the pieces kept untwisting as I was sweeping. Also make sure you really put the handle piece very tight on the end. First time I started sweeping, the handle snapped off and I thought it broke! It didn't break, it just slipped off the end. I put it back on and went to work.I will say that it does sweep the pine needles, etc. off my deck, but I found that the bristles aren't as dense as my typical house broom so kept leaving a lot to have to re-sweep. I then went back to my home broom to test it out, and it really did a much better job. Again, I really do love the width and I think it would do an okay job. I don't think it would be worth paying the price (I'm a vine reviewer), and I would have returned it if I had purchased it. Maybe it does better on concrete and more dirt?It really does feel cheap, and I wonder how long it will last, especially with aggressive sweeping. Also because you have to keep going over the same spots. Another disclaimer though is that I was sweeping my deck after it rained. I will update review when I try on the dry deck. It may do much better with dry debris.",
