But mostly the runner lip that touches the floor for sweeping into the pan does not contact the floor to allow small debris like dirt, crumbs, only can sweep large debris over the lip. Unless you push down hard to make it contact the floor flush to allow dust, small stuff. Only good for big debris and too heavy",
