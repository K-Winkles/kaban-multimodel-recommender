                "reviewText": "Like:*flexible lip on dustpan conforms to any non-flat surface to form a tight seal*lots of bristles on broom to push dirt*plastic comb to remove dirt stuck in bristles*plastic seems heavy and solid compared to some other small brooms.Not so much:*too many sections on the handles - I've started unscrewing them a couple of times while sweeping.*dustpan is fixed (doesn't rotate by itself). Similarly designed pans I've used are loose and automatically flip up when lifted. This one doesn't and you have to use your foot on it and pull to tilt it back. However, this does allow you to push the rubber lip into the floor just by tilting the handle forward.*Since 1 photo showed several handle lengths, I thought the handles might telescope but the only way to adjust the length is by removing a section.On rare occasions when the wind is strong and the rain heavy and from the south, I get some water in the garage. The squeegee would be useful in this situation but it hasn't happened in a while so I haven't tested it. It is sitting in a corner if I need to sweep some water.5 stars - Makes a good shop or garage sweep.",

That\u2019s the only part that feels cheap and won\u2019t last a long time. It is a little on the small side and seems to be made of thinner plastic, making it easy to break.The squeegee type broom works amazing. Hardwoods, carpet, and even walls.

All of the metal handles basically screw together, and they are color coded, which makes it easy. The handles screw into the dustpan, broom head, and squeegee, which is a nice addition to this set. The dustpan has dangerous looking teeth that will clean the soft, plastic bristles on broom head when you run it through them. That I like! I just hate pulling junk out of the broom that gets stuck. The dustpan stores flat when closed; it's easy to open using the provided instructions. The squeegee is a nice extra. I will be using this set in the garage, and the squeegee will be very helpful when cleaning the concrete floor. The dustpan, broom head, and squeegee are all plastic and rubber, so they are easy to clean. All of the tools in this set are long enough so you can sweep and clean standing straight up. Long handle, no bend over.",

                "reviewText": "One thing that's not too obvious is that this needs assembly. The handles are around a foot long, and need to be screwed together. It uses letters in the instructions but there are no corresponding letters on the poles.I had significant difficulty screwing into the dustpan portion.The broom handle doesn't clip to the dustpan handle - it just kinda sits on the bracket.The dustpan portion was stiff.. and did not easily come level with the floor like any other one of this style does. Which makes it a pain to use. It felt like whatever design decisions they could have made poorly, they chose to.",

                "reviewText": "As a mom always cleaning up after my kids, this Two Brooms set has been a lifesaver. The silicone broom is fantastic for everything from spilled liquids to fine dust. It's especially great for those pesky glass shards! The adjustable pole is a back-saver, extending up to 51 inches, meaning less bending for me. The outdoor broom comes with a dustpan that has a self-cleaning comb, a feature I didn't know I needed until I tried it - goodbye, manually pulling out hair and debris! The bristles are sturdy and work well on various surfaces, indoors and outdoors. Storing is a breeze; they lock together and fit perfectly in narrow spaces. This broom set keeps my floors spotless, making my hectic life a bit easier. Highly recommend for busy parents!",

                "reviewText": "I am old and squatting to sweep dust and debris into a little dustpan just isn't viable now. I love the dustpan that comes with this set. I didn't have to squat and I didn't have to use my hands to pull the hair off the broom. That claw works wonders, it really does pull all the hair off the broom.I haven't tried the squeegee \"broom\" much, because most of our spills are easier to sweep up with the broom. The silicone seems soft and pliant so I believe it'll work well.The only con I can think of is that the handles aren't telescoping, You can't pick a height between lowest and highest. You can only take out sections of the poles.",

                "reviewText": "Nice and durable broom and dustpan. Really like the \"combing\" feature of the dust pan with the rubber edge. It helps to remove dirt and any air from the bristles so that I'm not just moving dirt around or storing it in my broom and the rubber edge ensures the dirt goes in the pan. Squeegee works very well too. Very durable. Dustpan flips up for easy storage or to hang and store. Easy to assemble and a great value.",
