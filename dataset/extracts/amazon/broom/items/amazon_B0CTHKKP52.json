                "reviewText": "When I ordered this broom, I didn't even notice the size of it that was listed on the product page, otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it. It is very small. It takes a lot of swipes to get any significant amount of sweeping done with it. The squeegee too, is very small. Although it does indeed do a good job on the floor as a squeegee, you still are faced with cleaning up the water or other liquid off the floor that it has squeegeed up. So, I'm not sure where it helps accomplish cleaning up the mess off the floor in the first place.This would be good for small spills and small rooms, but not for the all-around family home. I still like the little guy though, since it is really good with cleaning bathtubs and showers. That is what I am using it for now, and it works really good. I don't have to bend and reach like I normally do and the brush is wonderful at getting soap scum off.If you need something for your big floor-cleaning jobs, get something bigger, though. If not, this would be a good little tool to use, especially for all of your bathroom needs. Oh, did I mention the bathroom walls too? Brush, squeegee, wipe, and your walls are all cleaned up. Not so bad for such a little Dude.",

                "reviewText": "This is great for sweeping pet hair or whatever else from carpet floors. My dog sheds a ton, so I use it to give the carpet a quick once over before vacuuming. I also have a large run that I can't properly vacuum, but the sweeper does a good job of keeping that tidy as well.",

                "reviewText": "Since my GSD puppy likes to drag sticks inside and chew them on my rugs, this has seriously come in handy. It grabs and pulls all the unvacuumable bits easily so I can get them on a dustpan. Only reason for the four stars vs five is that I wish the long handle felt sturdier. It holds, but it feels bendy. And that\u2019s a bit disconcerting.",
