                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Lola Products Large Angle Broom, and I must say, it's exceeded my expectations in every way. This broom is incredibly versatile, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. Whether I'm sweeping hardwood floors inside or tackling the patio outside, this broom gets the job done with ease.One of the standout features of this broom is its angled design, which allows it to reach into corners and under furniture effortlessly. The 13\" wide head ensures that I can cover larger areas in a shorter amount of time, making my cleaning sessions much more efficient.I also appreciate the eco-friendly aspect of this broom. The bristles are made from recycled soda bottles, making it a sustainable choice for environmentally conscious consumers like myself. Not only are the bristles durable and strong, but they also trap fine dirt and dust effectively, leaving my floors looking spotless.Maintenance is a breeze with this broom. The recycled flagged fibers can be easily rinsed with cool water for a quick clean, or I can opt for a deeper clean with my favorite cleaning solution when needed.Furthermore, the inclusion of a swivel hang hole for storage is a thoughtful addition. It allows me to hang the broom neatly when not in use, saving valuable space in my utility closet.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Lola Products, an American family-owned company, has truly delivered on quality and functionality with this broom. If you're in the market for a reliable cleaning tool that's both effective and eco-friendly, look no further than the Lola Products Large Angle Broom. It's a worthwhile investment that makes household chores a breeze.",

                "reviewText": "Yes, there are stick vacuums and blowers, but there are times when you still need or want a good broom. This one is environmentally friendly, the bristles are made from recycled plastic and it uses no fossil fuels in its operation. You burn calories instead and it is so much quieter. Takes up little space too. Best broom I\u2019ve had in a long time. It comes disassembled. For me it was really easy to put together. Written instructions are included as well as a QR code that links up to video showing how to assemble the handle and attach it to the broom. Does an excellent job of sweeping. The large head allows me to sweep up more with each pass. For instance I was able to sweep off my steps in just one go. Each step used to require several passes to get the job done, but not with this broom. And, it sweeps up fine particles easily. I swept sand off my sidewalk and driveway no problem at all.",

I was able to sweep my garage but it wasn\u2019t stiff enough to make it easy. It didn\u2019t push the heavier dirt (Little rocks and sand) very well. I persevered and got the garage clean anyway.

It is a very sturdy handle and I like that you can adjust it to your height depending on how many pieces you put together. I am 5 foot six and I used all the pieces and feel very comfortable using this Broom. I live in the south and we have lots and lots of sand well this broom head really sweeps it all up I was very pleased to see it getting all the sand. Because of it being made out of recycled plastic I\u2019m sure this broom is going to last a very long time we all know how indestructible plastic can be. My existing dustpan just a little plastic one snaps right on the broom handle perfectly so it\u2019s always at the ready. I think this is a very nice broom and I am very happy I ordered it .",

                "reviewText": "The 13\u201d Wide Head Angle Broom (ASIN: B0B8J439BZ) actually performed better than I anticipated several times. No instructions accompanied the broom, but really, they are not needed. The handle of the broom comes in 4 sections. These sections push together to form the complete handle. I applied some pressure during assembly and the parts never came apart again. The bottom section of the handle screws into the broom head. One must push the treaded section through the initial hole to reach the treaded hole within. Then screw them together firmly.The broom has a larger surface area, bigger than all angled brooms I have used. This I like, as I am able to be more effective with each stroke. The bristles seem to be durable and well attached to the head. Initially I though the bristles were going to be too springy, but that impression too was inaccurate. They perform well.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good-sized practical broom. The bristles, made of some manufactured material, are springy and keep their shape. The broom does a good job of sweeping up.This comes disassembled, the handle, in several pieces. You'll need to put it together but it's easy. The top piece has a white handle on it. The bottom piece is threaded. That one, you push through the hole in the broom head, far enough down so you find the threaded socket below. This you twist in until it's nice and tight. The handle pieces then fit together via friction: the female end is hollow, the male end has splines or ridges.One of my pet peeves is handles that twist while you're working so that the head turns. I'm not planning to take this broom handle apart again, so I put a few spots of silicone glue on the handle ridges before forcing the segments together. Permanent fix.",
