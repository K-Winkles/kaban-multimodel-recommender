                "reviewText": "\u201cHow can I begin to tell of the many things I have found? Or of the One who found me? I see His hand in my story like a weaver\u2019s shuttle through the warp, steady and sure, pulling here, loosening there, doing the work necessary for beauty. How do I tell of His capable hands, the ones that rescued me?\u201d\u201cBefore I can share the many ways I was found, I would have to begin with the day I was lost.\u201dAnd so, in the prologue, ( I hope you read prologues!) we have the reason for Heather Kaufman\u2019s imagination of Martha\u2019s life long before she ever met Jesus. As with other great Biblical fiction, Kaufman takes a few verses and passages we know of a Biblical individual. These are not changed from Scripture. But where Scripture is silent, the author suggests possible life events that send Martha, Mary, and Lazarus on their life trajectories until they encounter Jesus. \u201cMaybe she or he reacted this way because\u2026\u201d In the meantime, Kaufman\u2019s Martha becomes so real, so human, you will sympathize, you will judge, you will hold your breath as you hold her secrets, and you will wonder how she survived growing up in her father\u2019s house. You will begin to understand a woman\u2019s plight in Jewish society in the first century. Kaufman presents challenging relationships well. Some romantic, some familial, some friend-based. You will sigh, you will cry, you will ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d But hopefully, when all is said and done, you will turn to the Biblical story to check out what truth we do know, and you\u2019ll never view Martha or her siblings as 2- dimensional again!I received a copy of the book from the author and publisher, through Celebrate Lit via NetGalley, plus I bought my own ebook. No positive review was required, and all opinions are my own.Notable Quotables:\u201cYahweh keeps providing beacons of light in your life to guide you when you need it most.\u201d\u201cNone of us is worthy. We are all naked and undone before the holiness of God.\u201d\u201cWho can stand before this holy God?\u201d\u201cThose who align themselves with His Son.\u201d\u201cSometimes love engulfs us suddenly, like a consuming fire.\u201d\u201c\u2026Other times it comes over us slowly, like a sunrise.\u201d",

I have read three books about Martha and while I enjoyed each one I think Ms. Kaufman's is my favorite. It was clear she'd researched Martha, I liked how she showed why Mary was so frustrating to her. It made the story of Martha and Mary more realistic. I have a little brother so I could identify.The pace of the book was perfect. I kept waiting for Jesus to arrive on the scene and was so glad when He did.Ms. Kaufman is an author I will have on my radar and I highly recommend her. If you enjoy biblical fiction I encourage you to pick up this book. You won't be disappointed!",

This story focuses on Martha, the sister of Lazarus. The author takes us on a journey from Martha\u2019s life and includes her trials and challenges, the complexities of a female living in Biblical times, and complicated family relationships. Her life-changing encounters with Jesus reflect what is read in the Bible. Kaufman\u2019s easy-to-read writing style and meticulous research help the story have an authentic Biblical era feeling. The ending made me want to throw my fist in the air and shout, \u201cYes!\u201d I highly recommend this book and cannot wait for her next one in the series.
