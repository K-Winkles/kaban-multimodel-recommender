I felt I wanted to skip some of the extraneous info.My biggest frustration though and why I gave this only 3 stars is the premise used of the masquerade meeting of the H and h. I\u2019ve read this before where the two don\u2019t recognize each other later when they meet. This makes no sense, if the dance and conversation was so memorable that you fell in love with the person, how is it they couldn\u2019t recognize the voice of each other! Plus they only wore a mask as well. So their hair was visible, heights Etc. So it just isn\u2019t believable that there was absolutely no recognition until he said a similar phrase from the masquerade many months later. So that reduced the story by a star.Stories need to be realistic enough to be believable.",

If I had something to criticize, it would be that we never learn why Juliet stopped seeing Solomon, she does not even give a hint to her sister.

Both had become enamoured by masked characters they'd met at a ball and didn't realise they were 'socialising' in an enforced manner due to Cecilia chaperoning her younger sister. The story was delightful and the main characters endearing, the sister and mother were the usual society climbers and of course the younger sister was thought to have more to offer than the older sister, but Cecilia captured her H.E.A eventually.I would thoroughly recommend this book and look forward to the next book in the series.",
