It\u2019s very refreshing to read a book that actually admits that not only Jews were sent and died in the camps. My mom\u2019s cousin hid her Jewish girlfriend in her room..she was captured and died in Auschwitz\u2026her friend escaped! Reading this book reminds brings me back asking my dad how he survived the hard work...he said he did it for the children he might have one day..since he never got to see his parents again.. both died while he was in the labor camp.",

This was not the case with all the characters and the author did a very good job of handling the delicacy, although surely truthful feelings for some, on the subject. It certainly makes for interesting reading to try to see things from another's viewpoint.",

It was both heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. I\u2019d highly recommend this book",

Things that would be highly unlikely in that time and place. And the second to last main event ... After everything our brave heroine had endured, she would not have made that fateful choice. However, perhaps she went back and reclaimed what she had given up. Another chapter could be added bringing about satisfying closure.",
