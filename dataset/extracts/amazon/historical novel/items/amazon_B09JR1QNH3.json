                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Entertaining but OFFENSIVE!",
                "reviewText": "Debbie Rix has written a novel that I definitely enjoyed reading and looked forward to continuing each night for a few days. The explanations and motivations of the characters were made clear so the major plot twist was plausible - and in deed intriguing. But Jewish readers such as myself who tend to think beyond the lines might be deeply offended by its glaring omission, and assumptions that are the core of this book.Every scholar or even casual reader of the Holocaust understands that many groups of people were persecuted during Adolf Hitler's reign in Europe. But no group was singled out, chased, excluded, humiliated, tortured, hunted, robbed, and betrayed like the Jewish population was. Ignoring this and going the extra mile to reinforce the victimhood of the other groups is to betray the memory of the 6 million - even in fiction.In the book, the prisoners at Dachau were Communists, Political prisoners, Poles, and Russian POWsWhat? The writer intentionally leaves out that this prison/death camp was primarily housing Jews and that the prisoners were primarily Jewish. Nowhere in these pages is the reader allowed to understand that Dachau was home to Jews before the Germans could get around to legally murdering them.The maid in the story goes to market, is in the city, regularly runs errands........and never notices how the Jews are being hunted and made extinct during the entire war? She has no idea that the Jews are being evicted and \"resettled\" while their apartments and homes are liquidated. No mention at all of what is happening to the Jews of Munich during the entire 5 years that this couple is living in the heart of German Jewish misery.The wife walks around all day not knowing that her husband is torturing \"subjects\", (not Jews) all day at work. She doesn't see the flyers; she has no opinion about the trucks carrying away Jewish furniture, art, musical instruments, jewelry, appliances all day. One day she sees some people being treated badly.. They're not Jews though.... they're just people being treated harshly.The reader is owed a little truth in a novel such as this. The glaring and continual omissions are deeply offensive as the author goes out of her way to include the other persecuted types.The prisoners are never referred to as Jews in this book. The Volkswagon factory workers are not Jewish. The poor souls being experimented on are not Jews. The hundreds of corpses on the train outside are not Jewish. The prisoners about to go on the death march are not Jewish. The corpses in the ovens are not Jewish...... The mother in law wonders why there aren't more \"slaves\" around to help clear the roads.Announcement to Debbie Rix: The slaves were Jews. Those on the forced death marches were Jews. Those ashes in the ovens were Jewish ashes. The trainloads of dead bodies were Jewish dead bodies. The house that those Germans were living in was probably once a Jewish house. The mother in law's Jewish neighbors were previously arrested, tortured, starved, and deported. All this happened under the watchful eyes of those wonderful, thoughtful, kind, well mannered citizens of Munich: And the lovely, likeable German characters who were portrayed herein. Even Dr. Death is kindly. Please.The opportunity to educate a younger audience about who the Germans really were and how they watched as their neighbors (1 in 7 people were Jewish in Munich in 1938) were mercilessly destroyed is appalling to me. Would have been nice if someone in the story had noticed that by the end of the book the Jews of Germany were, well, gone.I did like the book though. Tell me a story. Make a good ending. Check and Check.",

The author does well to try and portray the emotions of each character, the challenges they each faced, how they dealt with the aftermath of the war. I was unaware of the Nazi requirement for its leaders to produce heirs, such that couples kidnapped children or planned affairs to have children. A worthwhile read.",

                "reviewTitle": "An Enthralling Read",
                "reviewText": "The German Wife is a finely woven story with a chilling undercurrent running below the normality of domestic life during the Nazi regime. The author focuses on the monstrous medical experiments that took place during that period and explores them through the lens of a young, na\u00efve wife and her husband, an ambitious doctor, whose desire for recognition allows him to become part of the SS and, in doing so, to bury his conscience in the name of \u2018science.\u2019Debbie Rix does an excellent job of bringing us into the era of World War Two in Germany. Annaliese, the German wife, is struggling to adjust to what has turned into a loveless marriage as her husband becomes consumed, yet horrified, by the medical experiments taking place at Dachau. The love she develops for a Russian prisoner-of-war is a tender backdrop to the dark and brutal forces at work around her.The German Wife is expertly researched and the author does not flinch from exploring the atrocities that took place during that era yet she seamlessly combines it with the daily day-to-day routine that continues in the midst of war. The dangerous decisions that are made within the cracks of that normality are what drives the book forward and makes it such an enthralling read. Highly recommended.",
