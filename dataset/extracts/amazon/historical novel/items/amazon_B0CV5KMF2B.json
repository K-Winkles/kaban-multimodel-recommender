The family is no longer able to say her correct name only call her Ella. When confronted by cousin, Marcus about her drab clothes Angelique\u2019s statement \u201cI always feel that anyone who has to rely on fine clothes in order to feel happy has a barren soul\u201d.Antoine is an adored childhood friend that moved to France when his family sold their estate, although he felt guilt about letting time and distance come between their connections. He returns to London to learn if he can find her again. Family goes to London for a season that their eldest daughter, Gwyneth could develop a match. Younger daughter, Grace is despised by her mother almost as much as Angelique herself.
