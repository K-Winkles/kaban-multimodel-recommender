Tabitha and her friends and Tabitha\u2019s desire to find out out what she really wanted and needed. She didn\u2019t fall for the fantasy society feeds us about getting a man and having happiness ever after. She was thoughtful and willing to take risks to achieve what she wanted.I have always thought Black women carried the most baggage and got the least support. In this book you feel that stress before she even gets to work in the morning. I could relate to that daily stress and the struggle to balance it all. It keeps you guessing how it will all be resolved. I want a 4th book aboutTabby cat and how she manageswith the baby , the job and future relations. I so love the strength of her friendships and how that\u2019s what carried her through her life.Excellent writing! Funny, compassionate and thought provoking!I also liked the development of relationships without mentioning race . The author shows us how relationships are developed regardless of racial differences by putting in the time to really know a person and their unique struggles. By learning about a person you are more tolerant of their differences and work harder to understand and be understood.Bonnie Davis Miller, Phd",
