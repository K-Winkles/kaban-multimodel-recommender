                "reviewText": "Book two in the series that follows a handful of families in WWI era England. To fully enjoy, I think reading the first book \"The Artist's Apprentice\" is necessary.This book picks up right where its predecessor left off, and while it does make veiled references to characters' backstories, to fully appreciate the story, reading in order is the way to go.The Artist's Wife follows Alice and Edmund's journey as stained glass artists who have secured several commissions and a workshop/cottage in the countryside away from London. This presents problems and solutions for the pair: it keeps Edmund miles away from his young daughter but allows him to cohabitate with his mistress and live in a pretend-marriage. Of course, the road is not entirely smooth, especially with war looming.By the end of the book, several main characters have been impacted by the fighting, the draft, the White Feather movement, and by nursing responsibilities. It ended on a bit of a cliffhanger which hopefully points to future additions to the series.",

                "reviewText": "This novel is the second in the Hearts of Glass series that I assume will continue. I did not read The Artist\u2019s Apprentice, but I felt this novel stood on its own. It is set during the volatile time of 1914-16, when World War I was beginning and the fabric of Edwardian society was unraveling.The heroine, Alice, was born into the upper reaches of British society but she and her great love, Edmund, also a product of wealth, fall in love, defy conventions and move to the country to do their art. They work together creating stained glass windows and other art pieces.The book opens with Alice\u2019s brother, Victor who becomes a major player in the overall story. He is coming back from America to continue working for Edmund\u2019s father, a hostile, emotionally barren, greedy man. Bear with me\u2014 this really isn\u2019t a soap opera. Victor had been in love with Edmund\u2019s brother, Gilbert, who was engaged to Alice. When Gilbert commits suicide, the planned path for all the children fall apart. Before really knowing Alice, Edmund married a beautiful, social climber and they have a daughter. Edmund can\u2019t abide her and leaves the marriage. She then lives with his father who is determined to cut Edmund off from his daughter.Through the characters' struggles, we get a real understanding of the social mores of the time. Suicide, divorce, out of wedlock pregnancy, gay love, are all issues that rise within the story. When Britain enters the war, the impact of other social movements of the time\u2014suffragettes and the white feathers, who shame young men into joining, are in full view. Victor, disgusted by the man he works for and the death of a lover on the Luisitania, joins up and finds himself in Gallipoli. That part of the book is very difficult to read but well done and important to know about.The book deepened for me as I read on. Alice and Edmund\u2019s struggles as the war comes closer to upending their lives, were deeply felt. Different aspects of war are confronted as Victor fights at Gallipoli and Edmund, attempts to protect his domestic world. Edmund has a strong moral compass and protective side. He needs to balance duty to country with the need to protect his family. Alice is also a great character, although I think given her inner strength and expansive sense of love and duty, her excessive emotion could have been pared back. Since the book ends in 1916, I am hoping Flynn finishes out the war in her next book of the series. I\u2019ll look forward to reading that",
