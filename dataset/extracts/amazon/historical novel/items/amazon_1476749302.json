He called it Faria. It was an old creature, a mottle of gray and white fur. Almost always, it kept to the edges of the tiny cell, scurrying along the wall to a corner where I\u2019d put a few crumbs of the hard biscuit that had been my meal. At night, I generally couldn\u2019t see it but could still hear the soft rustle as it moved from the wide crack between the corner blocks, across the straw on the floor, grabbed the crumbs, and returned the way it had come. Whenever the moon was just right and bright beams streamed through the high, narrow slit that was the only window, illuminating the stones of the eastern wall, I was sometimes able to glimpse in the reflected light the slender oval of Faria\u2019s body, its fur a dim silver blur, its thin tail roping behind like an afterthought of the animal\u2019s creation. The first time I got thrown into what the Brickmans called the quiet room, they tossed my older brother, Albert, in with me. The night was moonless, the tiny cell as black as pitch, our bed a thin matting of straw laid on the dirt floor, the door a great rectangle of rusted iron with a slot at the bottom for the delivery of a food plate that never held more than that one hard biscuit. I was scared to death. Later, Benny Blackwell, a Sioux from Rosebud, told us that when the Lincoln Indian Training School had been a military outpost called Fort Sibley, the quiet room had been used for solitary confinement. In those days, it had held warriors. By the time Albert and I got there, it held only children. I didn\u2019t know anything about rats then, except for the story about the Pied Piper of Hamelin, who\u2019d rid the town of the vermin. I thought they were filthy creatures and would eat anything and maybe would even eat us. Albert, who was four years older and a whole lot wiser, told me that people are most afraid of things they don\u2019t understand, and if something frightened you, you should get closer to it. That didn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t still be an awful thing, but the awful you knew was easier to handle than the awful you imagined. So Albert had named the rat, because a name made it not just any rat. When I asked why Faria, he said it was from a book, The Count of Monte Cristo. Albert loved to read. Me, I liked to make up my own stories. Whenever I was thrown into the quiet room, I fed Faria crumbs and imagined tales about him. I looked up rats in the worn Encyclopaedia Britannica on the school library shelf and discovered that they were smart and social. Across the years and the many nights I spent in the isolation of the quiet room, I came to think of the little creature as a friend. Faria. Rat extraordinaire. Companion to misfits. A fellow captive in the dark prison of the Brickmans. That first night in the quiet room, Albert and I were being punished for contradicting Mrs. Thelma Brickman, the school\u2019s superintendent. Albert was twelve and I was eight. We were both new to Lincoln School. After the evening meal, which had been a watery, tasteless stew containing only a few bits of carrot, potato, something green and slimy, and a little ham gristle, Mrs. Brickman had sat at the front of the great dining hall and told all the children a story. Most dinner meals were followed by one of Mrs. Brickman\u2019s stories. They usually contained some moral lesson she believed was important. Afterward, she would ask if there were any questions. This was a conceit, I came to understand, to make it seem as if there were an actual opportunity for dialogue with her, for the kind of conversation that might exist between a reasonable adult and a reasonable child. That evening, she\u2019d related the story of the race between the tortoise and the hare. When she asked if there were any questions, I\u2019d raised my hand. She\u2019d smiled and had called on me. \u201cYes, Odie?\u201d She knew my name. I\u2019d been thrilled at that. Amid the sea of children, so many that I didn\u2019t believe I would ever be able to learn all their names, she\u2019d remembered mine. I\u2019d wondered if maybe this was because we were so new or if it was because we were the whitest faces in a vast room full of Indian children. \u201cMrs. Brickman, you said the point of the story was that being lazy is a terrible thing.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true, Odie.\u201d \u201cI thought the point of the story was that slow and steady wins the race.\u201d \u201cI see no difference.\u201d Her voice was stern, but not harsh, not yet. \u201cMy father read that story to me, Mrs. Brickman. It\u2019s one of Aesop\u2019s fables. And he said\u2014\u201d \u201cHe said?\u201d Now there was something different in the way she spoke. As if she were struggling to cough up a fish bone caught in her throat. \u201cHe said?\u201d She\u2019d been sitting on a stool that raised her up so everyone in the dining hall could see her. She slid from the stool and walked between the long tables, girls on one side, boys on the other, toward where I sat with Albert. In the absolute silence of that great room, I could hear the squeak, squeak of her rubber heels on the old floorboards as she came. The boy next to me, whose name I didn\u2019t yet know, edged away, as if trying to distance himself from a place where he knew lightning was about to strike. I glanced at Albert, and he shook his head, a sign that I should just clam up. Mrs. Brickman stood over me. \u201cHe said?\u201d \u201cY-y-yes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I replied, stuttering but no less respectful. \u201cAnd where is he?\u201d \u201cY-y-you know, Mrs. Brickman.\u201d \u201cDead, that\u2019s where. He is no longer present to read you stories. The stories you hear now are the ones I tell you. And they mean just what I say they mean. Do you understand me?\u201d \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d \u201cYes or no?\u201d She leaned toward me. She was slender, her face a delicate oval the color of a pearl. Her eyes were as green and sharp as new thorns on a rosebush. She wore her black hair long, and kept it brushed as soft as cat fur. She smelled of talcum and faintly of whiskey, an aromatic mix I would come to know well over the years. \u201cYes,\u201d I said in the smallest voice I\u2019d ever heard come from my own lips. \u201cHe meant no disrespect, ma\u2019am,\u201d Albert said. \u201cWas I talking to you?\u201d The green thorns of her eyes stabbed at my brother. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d She straightened herself and scanned the room. \u201cAny other questions?\u201d I\u2019d thought\u2014hoped, prayed\u2014this was the end of it. But that night, Mr. Brickman came to the dormitory room and called me out, and Albert, too. The man was tall and lean, and also handsome, many of the women at the school said, but all I saw was the fact that his eyes were nothing but black pupils, and he reminded me of a snake with legs. \u201cYou boys\u2019ll be sleeping somewhere else tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cCome along.\u201d That first night in the quiet room, I barely slept a wink. It was April, and there was still a chill in the wind sweeping out of the empty Dakotas. Our father was less than a week dead. Our mother had passed away two years before that. We had no kin in Minnesota, no friends, no one who knew us or cared about us. We were the only white boys in a school for Indians. How could it get any worse? Then I\u2019d heard the rat and had spent the rest of those long, dark hours until daylight pressed against Albert and the iron door, my knees drawn up to my chin, my eyes pouring out tears that only Albert could see and that no one but him would have cared about anyway. FOUR YEARS HAD passed between that first night and the one I\u2019d just spent in the quiet room. I\u2019d grown some, changed some. The old, frightened Odie O\u2019Banion was, like my mother and father, long dead. The Odie I was now had a penchant for rebellion. When I heard the key turn in the lock, I sat up on the straw matting. The iron door swung open and morning light poured in, blinding me for a moment. \u201cSentence is up, Odie.\u201d Although I couldn\u2019t see the contours of the face yet, I recognized the voice easily: Herman Volz, the old German who oversaw the carpentry shop and was the assistant boys\u2019 adviser. The man stood in the doorway, blocking for a moment the glare of the sun. He looked down at me through thick eyeglasses, his pale features soft and wistful. \u201cShe wants to see you,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to take you.\u201d Volz spoke with a German accent, so his w\u2019s sounded like v\u2019s and his v\u2019s like f\u2019s. What he\u2019d said came out, \u201cShe vants to see you. I haf to take you.\u201d I stood, folded the thin blanket, and hung it across a rod attached to the wall so that it would be available for the next child who occupied the room, knowing that, like as not, it would be me again. Volz shut the door behind us. \u201cDid you sleep okay? How is your back?\u201d Often a strapping preceded time in the quiet room, and last night had been no exception. My back ached from the welts, but it did no good to talk about it. \u201cI dreamed about my mother,\u201d I said. \u201cDid you now?\u201d The quiet room was the last in a row of rooms in a long building that had once been the outpost stockade. The other rooms\u2014all originally cells\u2014had been turned into storage spaces. Volz and I walked along the old stockade and across the yard toward the administration building, a two-story structure of red stone set among stately elms that had been planted by the first commandant of Fort Sibley. The trees provided the building with constant shade, which always made it a dark place. \u201cPleasant dream, then?\u201d Volz said. \u201cShe was in a rowboat on a river. I was in a boat, too, trying to catch up with her, trying to see her face. But no matter how hard I rowed, she was always too far ahead.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t sound like a good dream,\u201d Volz said. He was wearing clean bib overalls over a blue work shirt. His huge hands, nicked and scarred from his carpentry, hung at his sides. Half of the little finger on his right hand was missing, the result of an accident with a band saw. Behind his back, some of the kids called him Old Four-and-a-Half, but not me or Albert. The German carpenter had always been kind to us. We entered the building and went immediately to Mrs. Brickman\u2019s office, where she was seated behind her big desk, a stone fireplace at her back. I was a little surprised to see Albert there. He stood straight and tall beside her like a soldier at attention. His face was blank, but his eyes spoke to me. They said, Careful, Odie. \u201cThank you, Mr. Volz,\u201d the superintendent said. \u201cYou may wait outside.\u201d As he turned to leave, Volz put a hand on my shoulder, the briefest of gestures, but I appreciated what it meant. Mrs. Brickman said, \u201cI\u2019m concerned about you, Odie. I\u2019m beginning to believe that your time at Lincoln School is almost at an end.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure what that meant, but I didn\u2019t think it was necessarily a bad thing. The superintendent wore a black dress, which seemed to be her favorite color. I\u2019d overheard Miss Stratton, who taught music, tell another teacher once that it was because Mrs. Brickman was obsessed with her appearance and thought black was slimming. It worked pretty well, because the superintendent reminded me of nothing so much as the long, slender handle of a fireplace poker. Her penchant for the color gave rise to a nickname we all used, well out of her hearing, of course: the Black Witch. \u201cDo you know what I\u2019m saying, Odie?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure, ma\u2019am.\u201d \u201cEven though you\u2019re not Indian, the sheriff asked us to accept you and your brother because there was no room at the state orphanage. And we did, out of the goodness of our hearts. But there\u2019s another option for a boy like you, Odie. Reformatory. Do you know what that is?\u201d \u201cI do, ma\u2019am.\u201d \u201cAnd is that where you would like to be sent?\u201d \u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d \u201cI thought not. Then, Odie, what will you do?\u201d \u201cNothing, ma\u2019am.\u201d \u201cNothing?\u201d \u201cI will do nothing that will get me sent there, ma\u2019am.\u201d She put her hands on her desk, one atop the other, and spread her fingers wide so that they formed a kind of web over the polished wood. She smiled at me as if she were a spider who\u2019d just snagged a fly. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cGood.\u201d She nodded toward Albert. \u201cYou should be more like your brother.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll try. May I have my harmonica back?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very special to you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cNot really. Just an old harmonica. I like to play. It keeps me out of trouble.\u201d \u201cA gift from your father, I believe.\u201d \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. I just picked it up somewhere. I don\u2019t even remember where now.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d she said. \u201cAlbert told me it was a gift from your father.\u201d \u201cSee?\u201d I said, shrugging my shoulders. \u201cNot even special enough to remember where I got it.\u201d She considered me, then said, \u201cVery well.\u201d She took a key from a pocket of her dress, unlocked a drawer of the desk, and pulled out the harmonica. I reached for it, but she drew it back. \u201cOdie?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am?\u201d \u201cNext time, I keep it for good. Do you understand?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I do.\u201d She gave it over and her spindly fingers touched my hand. When I returned to the dormitory, I intended to use the lye soap in the lavatory there to scrub that hand until it bled.

Forced to flee after committing a terrible crime, he and his brother, Albert, their best friend, Mose, and a brokenhearted little girl named Emmy steal away in a canoe, heading for the mighty Mississippi and a place to call their own. Over the course of one summer, these four orphans journey into the unknown and cross paths with others who are adrift, from struggling farmers and traveling faith healers to displaced families and lost souls of all kinds. With the feel of a modern classic, This Tender Land is an enthralling, big-hearted epic that shows how the magnificent American landscape connects us all, haunts our dreams, and makes us whole.

Though I\u2019ve enjoyed all of his books, and even loved many of them, This Tender Land is his one true epic. Epic not because his protagonist is named Odysseus. Instead, it\u2019s because all of the characters in this book are bigger than life, and the story itself is mythic in nature. I feel greatly indebted to Mr. Krueger for touching me so deeply with this story and for inspiring me to let the river of life flow through and beyond me.",

                "reviewText": "In 1932, four orphans take to the Mississippi River to flee the horrible conditions they have been living in. Odie and Albert are brothers. Odie is high-spirited and spend a lot of time in the solitary room, a shed with no comforts and usually a beating beforehand. Albert fares a bit better as he is a mechanical whiz. Mose is their best friend, a huge boy of Indian descent who was found in a ditch when he was four with his dead mother, his tongue cut out. Emmy is recently orphaned, her mother dead in a tornado. All are fleeing from the Lincoln Indian Training School where a cruel couple is in charge and the children there are treated as nothing more than money machines.The four decide to run away and take Emmy's father's canoe down the river to Saint Louis. Odie and Albert's aunt lives there and they hope she might be able to take them in. Along the way, they encounter lots of people they will always remember, both good and bad. They are fugitives, both from the school and from the death of one of their tormentors that Odie might be responsible for. They meet a man living alone with his demons, an Indian who teaches Mose about his heritage, families living in a Hooverville and members of a revival show. They learn from each individual they meet and when they make it to Saint Louis, they learn the truth about their family background.Krueger is best known for his mystery series featuring Cork O'Connor, an Indian/Irish sheriff. This work is a stand alone novel set in his favorite state, Minnesota, and details the lives and relationships of these four children who have formed a family that transcends blood. Readers will fall in love with Odie who narrates the story and cheer for the children to find a life that is normal and loving. This book is recommended for readers of literary fiction.",

It flows effortlessly from page to page and chapter to chapter, telling the story of the four vagabonds, four children bound by a mutual misery. In fleeing their past, they find themselves as individuals and bind themselves as family and as friends. Along the way, they create other families and forge other friendships.The author does not pretend that this is not yet another version of the Odyssey. He verily beats us over the head with it. No matter. That is the point. His intent was not to be subtle.My only complaint is this. The protagonist, the storyteller, Odile, is but twelve years old in this novel. Even taking his experiences and the time period, he is mature beyond his years. I would have made him a touch older. Not much, but a touch.The best book that I have read in quite a long time.",

                "reviewText": "This may well become WKK's best-known book. While I admire his skills as a writer (I've read all of his previous novels), this book was not to my taste. I far prefer his Cork O'Connor mysteries. Others are likely to have a very different reaction, so I will attempt to clarify my response.First and foremost, this is a mainstream novel, not a mystery or a crime novel. There is criminal activity but it is leveraged for the purpose of gaining some suspense. The only 'mystery' in the story is 'how it will all end' and some of that is telegraphed.The story concerns two Irish boys who are orphaned and sent to a school for Native Americans in Minnesota. It is 1932 and the results of the great depression are everywhere. There they meet a Native boy who has had his tongue cut out and a young girl who is the daughter of one of the teachers at the school. The school is run by a sadistic monster and her weak, enabling husband. The kids call this woman the 'black witch' and she fully deserves the title. There is a kindly German man at the school who operates a secret 'still for moonshine and an awful man who is given to beating and sodomizing the children. The four kids escape and head down river toward St. Louis, where the narrator (Odysseus 'Odie' O'Banion) has a still-living aunt. She lives on Ithaca Street in St. Louis.At this point you can see part of my problem. The book explicitly updates/leverages/mimics HUCKLEBERRY FINN and Homer's ODYSSEY. At one point they meet a one-eyed man called Jack who is threatening but a lot less evil than Polyphemus. Odie is tempted by a lovely young woman who is different, fortunately, from Circe. They visit Hoovervilles and meet a woman who is a carbon copy of Aimee Semple McPherson. Thus, Odie becomes a kind of Forrest Gump making the cultural tour of depression-era America. The author admits many of these influences in an author's note at the end of the novel. Throughout his adventures Odie and his companions are subjected to horrific suffering. At the same time, Odie narrates several of the chapters in present time, so that we are assured that he survived eventually and that we should not fear the worst. Pretty much close to 'the worst' eventually occurs, however, and we are left with the somewhat cold comfort of a faith in a 'tender land' and the strength of the human spirit that creates lasting friendships and occasional victories. I didn't expect WKK to go all Horatio Alger and turn Odie into the Governor of Missouri or the owner of Budweiser or Ralston Purina. His Aunt Julia does rebound very, very well, however and (SPOILER) one of the kids plays three seasons for the Cardinals.The pain suffered by the kids is uncommonly harsh but they are plucky, gifted and feisty. There is, however, a great deal of melodrama and sentimentality in the telling of their tale. That, of course, is the stuff of best sellers and some 'classics'. Hence, many readers are likely to say that this book changed their lives and the plight of the characters was unforgettable.I know what WKK can do with a mystery or crime narrative, however, and I would prefer seeing him create a small masterpiece each time out than to fashion a mainstream novel which sounds all too familiar and is a bit of a pastiche. Still and all, I did have tear-stained cheeks at the novel's end, just as I do every time I read Dickens, another influence acknowledged by WKK in his author's note.Hence I award a somewhat reluctant four and a half stars, knowing that some readers will want to award six. I do not have the temerity to compare myself with Oscar Wilde, but it was Oscar who said that 'One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell without laughing.' I am too subject to sentiment to find myself laughing but there were moments in THIS TENDER LAND when I did feel manipulated.",
