        "description": "A Best Book of the Year by NPR and Christian Science MonitorCalled \u201cwholly engrossing\u201d by New York Times bestselling author Kathleen Grissom, this \u201cfully immersive\u201d (Lisa Wingate, #1 bestselling author of Before We Were Yours) story follows an enslaved woman forced to barter love and freedom while living in the most infamous slave jail in Virginia.Born on a plantation in Charles City, Virginia, Pheby Delores Brown has lived a relatively sheltered life. Shielded by her mother\u2019s position as the estate\u2019s medicine woman and cherished by the Master\u2019s sister, she is set apart from the others on the plantation, belonging to neither world.She\u2019d been promised freedom on her eighteenth birthday, but instead of the idyllic life she imagined with her true love, Essex Henry, Pheby is forced to leave the only home she has ever known. She unexpectedly finds herself thrust into the bowels of slavery at the infamous Devil\u2019s Half Acre, a jail in Richmond, Virginia, where the enslaved are broken, tortured, and sold every day. There, Pheby is exposed not just to her jailer\u2019s cruelty but also to his contradictions. To survive, Pheby will have to outwit him, and she soon faces the ultimate sacrifice. Read more",

                "reviewText": "In first-person narrative we see the world through the enslaved eyes of Pheby Delores Brown. She is biracial\u2014daughter of an enslaved mother and white plantation owner\u2014and when the story opens we learn how this identity has given her an unusual upbringing: the opportunity to learn to read and write (although illegal), learn how to play the piano, and the enjoyment of her father and his sister\u2019s kind attention. Pheby also is in love with an enslaved man on the plantation, Essex, who urges her to join him in his plans to run away. But Pheby declines, naively trusting that she\u2019ll be given her freedom on her eighteenth birthday as her father promised. But when her father is killed in an accident, Pheby\u2019s circumstances abruptly change. Her father\u2019s widow, jealous and angry, sells her. Pheby\u2019s life changes forever. In a shocking reversal, Pheby survives horrific shackled treatment as she\u2019s transported south, deep into enslaved areas. Eventually, she finds herself far from home in Richmond, Virginia, a jail and auction block named Devil\u2019s Half Acre, run by a sadistic slave trader known as the Jailer. The Jailer is attracted to her, and Pheby becomes his \u201cyellow wife.\u201dThis story is gut-wrenching; the slave traders\u2019 torture of men, women and children is horrific and inhuman. But the story withholds sinking entirely into horror because of Pheby\u2019s determination to survive. Her fierce protection for her children, the love she has for Essex, her own tenacity to bear up under wildly dangerous circumstances make the risks she takes all the more harrowing because we can feel what\u2019s at stake. The Jailer\u2019s mercurial personality\u2014his lightning switch from generosity to sadistic cruelty,\u2014create such tense drama that the reader is constantly on edge. I stayed up well past midnight several nights in a row to read Pheby\u2019s story. The horrors of slavery need to be acknowledged and I think this book has come at a perfect time as our society reckons with this past. Amazingly, Pheby\u2019s character was based on a true story explained in the author\u2019s note of a heroic enslaved woman, Mary Lumpkin, who lived at Devil\u2019s Half Acre as the mistress of the slave trader and jailer. Yellow Wife honors Mary Lumpkin\u2019s true sacrifice. Repost of goodreads review.",

I didn\u2019t feel anything that was written was far fetched, all of the horrible things that the author wrote about were present during slave days. The characters were real as were, unfortunately, their actions and the cruelty people of color suffered. The book kept my interest, I didn\u2019t want to put it down until finished. I picked up a couple of books in Cincinnati written by slaves, actual experiences and I want to read them even more now. I\u2019ll read more of Ms Johnson\u2019s books in the future.",

She went from Basically having as much of a priviledged life a slave could have To Becoming in my humblest opinion an unofficial missus of the house. She was not free But had a level of freedom that was not available to all black people during that time. It was unfortunale that to keep her children alive and \"free-ish\" she had to seperat\u00e8 her son whose father was black from her and her daught\u00e8rs whose father was white therefore they were able to white passIn the end her goal was achieved By Keeping all of her children alive.",

                "reviewText": "Remarkable book that I could not put down. I have always understood slavery to be repulsive, but this book opened my eyes to the under reported accounts of just how blatantly abhorrent in its reality. So thank you to Sadeqa Johnson for her fine research and gift of story telling. I am in your debt for educating me!",

                "reviewTitle": "A powerful, heartbreaking and inspiring read",
                "reviewText": "The story of Pheby Delores Brown is a powerful, heartbreaking and inspiring read. Although a fictional story, it\u2019s interwoven with real historical events and places, such as the infamous Devil\u2019s Half-Acre, a jail where slaves were broken, tortured, and sold. There are so many interesting multi-faceted characters in this book but it is Pheby who will ultimately capture your heart. Yellow Wife is a mesmerising story of courage, survival, and striving to be free.What makes this story even more heartbreaking is the knowledge that the brutality and slavery happened. Yellow Wife is predominantly about Pheby, although it also highlights for black men and women, slavery was an equally devastating experience. Both were forced to perform gruelling labor, subjected to mental and physical degradation, and denied their most basic rights. Enslaved men and women were beaten mercilessly, separated from loved ones arbitrarily, and, regardless of sex, treated as property in the eyes of the law. It\u2019s books like this that are a stark reminder of a shameful period in American history.The story is graphic in its details of the atrocities played out against the slaves. It\u2019s not an easy story to read. After all, it\u2019s a brutal and harrowing account of slavery. But it\u2019s also an unforgettable story of determination and endurance. Yellow Wife is a beautifully written, moving book that is compelling and intricately researched. Pheby\u2019s story is one which will stay in my thoughts for a long time to come. Highly recommended.",
