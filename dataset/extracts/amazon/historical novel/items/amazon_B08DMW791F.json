What started out as a readily embraced feud over time melded to respect and even friendship. A very interesting look at the outrageous lifestyles lived by the very rich, their striving to be at the top of the societal pyramid. Also a reminder that the parties, the balls, the clothing all were hiding the thing missing from their lives over which they had no control. The men controlled everything. The women had the social part of the relationship, used to enhance the value of the men they served. This book was well written and gave me a taste of The Four Hundred that I had never understood. They were real people. What different times those were. Maybe still are!",

The author of this book ( Renee Rosen) has chosen to add some fiction between the facts to describe the competition between the two women and how it effected their personalities, their spouses, their families, friends and residential areas. The author also describes in detail how she wrote the book and questions for book clubs.",

My only complaints are the huge gaps in time leaving us unaware of how certain storylines played out and the dialect was far too modern.

It was obvious Ms. Rosen had done her research, as the story spanned 3 decades. Both Mrs. Astor and Mrs. Vanderbilt saw a lot of tragedy in their lives. We don't often realize that when we hear the usual stories from that time. The story really transported me back to that era with the fashion descriptions and the peek into the daily life of the rich and famous. You can be sure things were extremely cutthroat then!! At first I was not sure I liked the \"social character\" but as I read, I realized it gave an even deeper look at the world at that time.",

                "reviewText": "I like historical books that are set in particular periods. This one highlighted the position of women in the late 19th and early 20th century in New York. It's based on real characters who are well known and tells you a lot about them and their families. I found it an interesting contrast to the books of Edith Wharton from an earlier era. The position of women hadn't changed as much as one might have thought.",
