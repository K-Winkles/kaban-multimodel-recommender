                "reviewText": "Series Info/Source: This is a stand alone book. I got a copy of this book through Amazon First Reads.Thoughts: I enjoyed the unique setting for this book but thought the writing was a bit awkward and the story was just so-so. This book takes place during WWII in Shanghai. It follows a young heiress named Aiyi who owns her own nightclub and a Jewish refugee named Ernest who ends up playing the piano at her club. They end up falling in love but get caught up in all the politics and war of the time.Both Ernest and Aiyi aren't all that likable. Ernest is strangely selfish and doesn't really take his sister's needs into account. Aiyi wants to be successful and is selfish as well. To be fair, to survive in this time it seems like you had to be selfish. I did like that Aiyi was a business owner and tried to stand up for herself as a woman, but she also let a lot of the men in her life force her into bad situations. I didn't really like either of them and felt like their romance was quick and forced. I don't think it helped that the dialogue throughout felt stilted and awkward to me.The story starts in the present and then goes back to the past and then ends in the present. It ends up tying together decently but I found parts, especially in the second half, to be a bit boring and hard to stay engaged in. This feels odd for me to say with all the death and torture going in the background, but we spent a lot of the book just kind of waiting and I struggled to stay interested.I did greatly enjoy the unique historical setting and learning about the events in Shanghai in WWII. I knew that the Japanese had invaded Shanghai but wasn't aware of all the other international pressures in Shanghai at the time. I also had not realized that Shanghai was such a huge refuge for Jews fleeing Europe. I really enjoyed getting a look into the effects of WWII on a region of the world that you don't often get to read about during that time frame.My Summary (3/5): Overall this was okay; I really liked learning about Shanghai and the events that took place there during WWII. I didn't enjoy the awkward writing and dialogue, the unlikable characters, and the winding somewhat pointless plot. While I am happy to have learned more about Shanghai in this historical time, I don't plan on picking up anymore books by this author.",

The going back to the war years before continuing in the present let you see the past of the main character in just his and pieces.I also enjoyed how she realized that she actually did love her cousin/fiancee, even if it wasn't the passionate love she had for Ernest.The fact that several of the characters had regrets that haunted them for years felt very realistic.I enjoyed how the focus was on how war affected the average citizens much more than the soldiers.I would recommend this book.",
