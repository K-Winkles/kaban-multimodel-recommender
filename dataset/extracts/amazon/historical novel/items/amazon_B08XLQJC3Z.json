                "reviewText": "I discovered Ann Bennett not too long ago and have since read all her books. Her books are always enjoyable and she is able to paint an excellent picture. This book had a great sense of mystery to it. Ann Bennett\u2019s book tend to go over multiple time frames. This one took up 3 different time frames. My favourite bits are always the timeframes from the 30/40s I think this book would have been just as successful if it had told just the story of Amelia. I could have easily read more and more of Amelia\u2019s story. For Kate\u2019s story o enjoyed guessing what her and Joan could have possibly done, but also could have done without her part. If I saw it was a chapter to do with Amelia I would always keep reading, if it was a chapter about Kate that was my signal to go to bed. With that said I am always looking forward to more books by Ann Bennett and cannot wait for the next",

Also it was about her niece Kate had inherited her great aunts cottage and finding out what exactly happened during during those years before her aunt came back to England. As well as finding herself after thinking for many years exactly what happened the summer of 1940 in England. The story goes back-and-forth between 1930\u2019s and 1970. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading fiction books based on historical facts.",
