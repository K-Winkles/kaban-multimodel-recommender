        "description": "Since they were children running barefoot about Toulouse Plantation, Josie and Cleo have been as close as sisters, forging an unbreakable bond that defies their roles as mistress and slave. Together, the two have shared secrets and protected each other through happiness and heartbreak. They never dream they could also share an intense passion for the same man, the elegant, charming, and irresistibly seductive Bertrand Chamard. His love will change their friendship forever and set in motion a series of events from which there can be no turning back. Set among the bayous of Old Louisiana and the grand avenues of New Orleans, ALWAYS & FOREVER is the stirring saga of a Creole family and of two women, bound by blood and friendship, who are tested by prejudice, betrayal, and the tragedies of slavery. Book I of THE PLANTATION SERIES. Includes Book Group discussion questions.",

                "reviewText": "Really enjoyed this one, but I am rating it a four because I didn't think Cleo should've ended up living the same life as her mother, though the author did say she paid her own way. Yet, I was disappointed in the turn of events for her and for Josephine, and I had hoped they wouldn't allow Cleo to be bleed when she had Yellow Jack. Otherwise, the novel is a good read and some may not be bothered by those events and feel they just make the story. It is a worthy story to read set during antebellum days in New Orleans. I love books set during that time period, which is why I chose to read it. I thought the author did a very good job with characterization and description since I was able to visualize the characters and felt like I came to know them. The author also did a great job of illustrating character change in Josie from the time she was a young girl to the time she became a woman. The best part of the book to me was the great job the author did with the flood experience. I am from Louisiana and endured a flood in 83 and one in 93 when the Mississippi River flooded its banks and entered my home both times, so I could really envision the flood and felt she did a wonderful job with description. I think that was my favorite part of the book though it was sad, probably because I could identify with the flood situation. This is the first novel I have read by this author, but I've bought the other two books in this series and look forward to reading them as well, even though reviewers say this one is the best of the three. It would be hard to top this one. I tend to choose my own books and make up my own mind rather than listen to reviews. If you like books set in this time period, you should enjoy this one. I did. The author also does a great job handling the relationship between the siblings, and that was another favorite part of the book for me",

                "reviewText": "An in-depth look at slavery on the old plantations, Always & Forever exposes two sides of the issue.On the one hand we have Emil Tassin, the good-hearted owner of Toulouse Plantation. He has fathered not only a beautiful young daughter with his wife Celine but also an equally lovely daughter with one of the slave women, Bibi. As was often the case, the wife produced and heir but his love lies with Bibi. This story centers around the two daughters \u2013 Josie the heir and Cleo, the slave child.Both girls are brought up together and at an early age Emil makes Cleo a gift to his daughter. He is highly aware that his wife resents not only Bibi but the child Cloe; when Celine (the wife) attempts to sell both Bibi and Cleo along with baby Thibault (another master/slave child), Emil arrives home just in time to save for Bibi and her children. Celine goes into a decline when she realizes that Emil truly loves the slave woman.Josie and Cleo share many things as they grow, but not until they are in their teens do they both fall for the same man, Bertrand Chamard, who happens to be a distant cousin of Josie\u2019s on her mother\u2019s side. All seems to be going along well but in the end all their lives take unexpected turns.As insightful as Gone With The Wind was, it only glossed over the true nature of slavery. Always & Forever exposes the dirty side, the cruel side. Author Gretchen Craig gives the reader wonderfully complex characters as well as a look at the lush bayous along the Louisiana shores of the Mississippi. We meet characters from every corner \u2013 the Creoles, the Cajun, and les Americains.I was charmed by the boyish outlook of Phanor; impressed by the worldliness of Bertrand; loving the fierce independence of Cleo; and rooting for Josie to find her way. A wonderful group of secondary characters helps to fill the pages and round out the story. The story line is full of twists and I simply couldn\u2019t put the book down.Always & Forever is the first of a four-book series and this reader looks forward to reading them all.",
