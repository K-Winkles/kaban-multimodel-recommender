                "reviewText": "As we sit in relative safety and watch and listen to news reports on the number of \"illegal\" migrants entering our country or Europe, we are usually not exposed to the true humanity of the crises. Instead, the migrant situation is a flashpoint political topic. This book instead offers a glimpse into what individuals must go through to leave dangerous conditions and try to find a peaceful existence somewhere in the world, where they and their families are safe, like us. For me, this story was eye-opening. It helped me comprehend the absolute desperation of these people and how much they've lost and sacrificed. I hope we can demonstrate compassion while developing some solutions for these people without sacrificing the safety we have and that most of them seek. Thank you, Ms. Lefteri.",

                "reviewText": "An important and interesting story told in a unique style.Following Nuri and Afra on their journey from war-torn Syria to England provided a unique view into the lives and struggles of refugees seeking asylum. While this topic is an important one, I feel as though this book fell short.The first item glaringly missing is the connection to Nuri being a beekeeper with.... anything. As the title of the book and what was pushed to be an important part of Nuri's life in the beginning, I had a hard time connecting the importance, or even symbolism, of this after reading.Nuri and Afra faced a treacherous journey that would be filled with many faces, places, and struggles. Even so, it felt as though these were glossed over and even downplayed at times. I struggled to feel the emotions being told (instead of shown) due to this.In addition, the couple faces many mental and physical illnesses due to the war. These were resolved almost instantly at the end of the book with little development. This seemed jarring and dismissive of the long-term struggles citizens of war-ravaged lands face. Similarly, I was hoping for more character development as this couple faced excruciating events together.All-in-all, I felt as though this book provided me insight into the journey that refugees face while seeking asylum. While I craved more from the book, I felt deeply for Nuri and Afra which kept me hooked until the end. In addition, I enjoyed Lefteri's writing style, including the unique transitions mid-chapter using one word to end the sentence of the last half and start the sentence of the next.\u201cI think the bees are like us,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are vulnerable like us.\"",

However, it befuddles me why authors think they must confound a novel with a convoluted and confusing time warp instead of telling a story in a direct sequence. This book is full of flashbacks and mental states that makes it difficult for the reader to know where the characters are and when, what is real and what is not, and most frustrating of all whether they were actually granted final asylum in Great Britain so the main character could return to beekeeping and whether the wife's eyesight returned so she could continue her art. Instead the book ends abruptly leaving the reader hanging. Just found this book frustrating to read and just could not connect with the characters nor comprehend the author's supposed symbolism.",

                "reviewText": "The book has 360 pages split into 14 numbered chapters - each of those is then broken in two by flashbacks to the back story which are triggered by specific words - \"hope\", \"morning\", \"a key\" and others.This had been recommended by many people and was first published in 2019 so I was surprised it had taken me so long to pick it up.It's an interesting thought that this is based on Syrian refugees. In the last 4-5 years many more refugees are on the move, speaking many different languages but there are still people trying to escape from Syria today - the countries vary but the stories remain very similar and this book stays very current.The first part of each chapter gives the story of the couple in the UK as they seek asylum. The second part tells us the story of why they have had to escape using chronological flashbacks.It's a frequently used structure to have two time lines but I've not seen it done quite like this and it works well.Throughout the book there is a lot of symbolism - illustrating connections and differences - water is used multiple times and colour is a very visual theme.More deeply, the book considers the effects of trauma and displacement. Nuri and Afia carry their memories and we are frequently reminded about their experiences.Poignantly, as I was sitting at home reading about a boat trip across the sea in a dinghy, my phone flashed, telling me about 4 people who had died in a similar boat in the English Channel. This emphasised the tragedy on a very human level.In parts, the account has a feint hallucinogenic quality to it which has the effect of making Nuri's story more real. He is seeing visions brought on by trauma, hunger and desperation - we see them through him, we know they are not always there but we still believe that he sees them (clever writing!!).The author writes in a way that portrays the best of humanity and the worse through the same piece of narrative. There is hope and despair together with many other contrasting emotions.The natural beauty of the world continually shines through the horror, giving Nuri a reason to keep going on. Of course, the bees are the major theme then alongside there are wonderful descriptions of nature - showing how it can thrive through adversity. Lots of metaphors and much deep meaning.At the end of this book there is an Acknowledgements section. This explains all the amazing people who helped this book come to life and made it real. It is a work of fiction but has many roots from genuine people.It is sensitive, emotional and beautiful.",

                "reviewText": "Key takeaways from reading the book:- Page 20: In Syria, there is a saying which goes like this: Inside the person you know, there is a person you do not know.- Page 75: People told stories of people, who never made it to Greece - of whole families, men, women and children, lost at sea.- Pages 207 and 261: Afra explained to a doctor that she became blind through a bomb. Telling the story about becoming blind, she explained that her son Sami wanted to play outside, because being inside all the time was like a prison for him. As there had not been bombs for two days, she let her son play outside. Suddenly, she heard a whistle from the sky and went out to her son. When she got to the door, there was a loud explosion and bright light. Since then, she has not been able to see. The last thing she saw was the eyes of her son Sami, who was looking up at the sky. Her son died from the explosion. The doctor explained to Afra that it is possible that the blindness, which Afra is experiencing, is the result of trauma. Following up on this, the doctor explained that sometimes our bodies can find ways to cope, when we are faced with things that are too much to bear. On page 261, Afra explained that since she told the doctor about the bomb, it is all she can think of. She can see the face of her son Sami. She can see Sami's eyes looking up at the sky. She wonders what her son felt: Was he in pain? What did he feel when he looked up at the sky? Did he know that she, his mother, was there?- Page 214: Two brothers, Ryad and Ali, told their story. They explained that they had fled Afghanistan and people, who killed their father. They explained that after their father's death, the twins were targeted by The Taliban. They mentioned that their mother had asked them to leave, because she was afraid she would lose them as well. They also explained that their mother had kissed their faces a hundred times because she was afraid she would never see them again. Their journey went through Turkey and Lesbos. They explained that they had slept on the streets.",
