                "reviewText": "To The Wild Horizon will appeal to a wide audience. It's a well-researched historical fiction novel of the Oregon Trail and the difficulties pioneers faced but it is also character-driven. Through Grace, we experience the prejudices faced by women who traveled without a husband. Indeed, the rampant misogyny she faces is maddening and sometimes deadly. The author also touches on the uglier consequences of Manifest Destiny as native tribes are driven from their territories. If you like a bit of romance in your reading, you'll enjoy the bumpy relationship between Grace and the military leader of the wagon train. I found it amusing that nothing made the men angrier than the fact that Grace could handle things on her own. The patriarchy was certainly thin-skinned. I enjoyed this book immensely but I'm grateful that if I want to go to Oregon, I can fly.",

                "reviewText": "Missouri, 1846 and Grace Sinclair and her ten year old brother Tom, had quickly packed their meagre belongings and joined the wagon train, to head along the wild and desolate Oregon trail to their destination, to join their brother Zachary, and safety. Their parents had died not long before of cholera and Grace vowed to protect Tom with everything she had. She knew the journey ahead would be hard; would test them all - but she was determined.Captain James Randolph was in charge of the long trip - he'd made it before - and was a strong leader over his soldiers and the travellers. But he scared most of the women and children with his aloof and stern demeanor. When trouble struck soon after leaving Fort Laramie, both Grace and Randolph became involved. Randolph was furious, but a plan needed to be made and executed. Could it work? With the new friends Grace had made - Mrs Eliot, Lillian Hollingswood and Eunice Turner (wife of Randolph's best friend, and second in charge) - she had the support she needed. But the way ahead was treacherous and the threat of attacks by the local Indians high...I was looking forward to To the Wild Horizon very much, and I wasn't disappointed. Imogen Martin hit the nail on the head with this one; wild west at its best, and I loved it. The many months long journey over wild and rough terrain; the crossing of rivers, some small, some wide and flowing fast; damage to the wagons; illness which swept the group and more. I was captivated from the beginning and was sad to finish. I read the author's previous book - Under a Gilded Sky - and loved that one as well. I'm looking forward to finding out what the author has in mind for us next. Highly recommended.",

Never did she ever believe she would have to use them. In an act of self-defense, Grace shoots her landlord, but who is going to believe her? Forced to leave Independence, Missouri before the law catches up to her, Grace lies her way onto a wagon train claiming to be one Mrs. Sinclair traveling with her son Tom.Grace and her younger brother Tom take the perilous journey on the Oregon Trail to meet up with their older brother, before the law can catch up to them. As they set off on the Great Plains, Grace does her level best to not draw any attention to her or Tom, despite the Army Captain James Randolph guiding their train having it out for her. They negotiate treacherous rivers, travel for days without water in sight, fix broken axles, face angry Native American tribes, and cross the Rocky Mountains ahead of snow. Throughout the journey, Grace does her best to keep her reputation in tact despite her circumstances. She proves to be incredibly resilient despite the many setbacks on their journey and gains the respect of several of her fellow overlanders along the way.Though westerns aren\u2019t typically my genre of choice, I am always down for a strong female protagonist. Grace has courage and determination in spades. I found myself rooting for her success the whole way west, and I bet you will too.",

They join up with a wagon train at Independence, Missouri in 1846. They were already planning on heading to Oregon, although they had to leave quicker than they had originally planned on. Captain Randolph is the leader of the wagon train. He doesn't allow single women to travel in his trains, he'd rather not have any women on the train, simply because they are a liability. They're weak and can't do much or take care of themselves. Grace and Randolph butt heads in many ways along the trail. Grace finds herself discriminated against, by the Captain. They both have to learn to work together and not against each other. This is a great historical fiction novel. Highly recommend. I will read it again and again in the future. I will look for it to give as a gift to my book-loving friends.

                "reviewText": "Why is Martin's second novel impossible to put down? It has two vital ingredients I look for in a novel: a complex love story with two strong characters who change and develop throughout, each of them, and secondly a fascinating setting that's completely new to me. I know from Imogen Martin's debut novel UNDER A GILDED SKY that painstaking historical research is a hallmark of hers, and this time she has taken me by the hand on the Oregon Trail in mid-nineteenth century north America. I'm driving a dusty wagon pulled by mules, all my worldly goods crammed in behind me, including my chickens. The wagon train has a varied cast of characters, mostly families: the overlanders, pioneers who have left the area which is currently settled by the USA, to start a new life out West. We are protected on our perilous adventure by the army, under the command of the stern unbending Captain Randolph.Every night we camp together in a laager - to borrow an appropriate term from the contemporary South African experience. We face multiple dangers - mountains and wild rivers to cross. There are murderous attacks from the people whose land this has been for countless generations: Martin handles the issue of the First Americans particularly sensitively, as one would expect from a Quaker.At the end I'm left with two questions: when can I read the next Imogen Martin novel, and hey - wouldn't this one make a great Hollywood blockbuster?",
