        "description": "When do secrets become lies? When is grit not enough? A story of broken lives and deep friendships, inspired by true events in 1939, when the shadows of World War II lengthened.Scarred by burns from a kerosene lantern, twelve-year old Sissy knows electricity is more than her farm family\u2019s dream. It\u2019s vital. She also knows they can\u2019t afford the required deposit to be connected to electric lines, so she wrangles a secret deal in order to help her parents. As she faces danger and sacrifices to support her family, Sissy\u2019s best efforts fail. She\u2019s blind to what she needs most, and when she finally tells her secrets, she fears it\u2019s too late.Set in Kansas farmland, More than Grit is an unforgettable story of determination to succeed against all odds and will appeal to middle-grade and teen readers, their parents, and anyone who roots for the underdog.Award winning author Gretchen A. Carlson fills her characters with grit and grace as she shares the story her grandmother kept secret.",

                "reviewText": "In 1939 a young girl named Sissy shimmies up a tree to \u2018borrow\u2019 apples from the crazy old war vet, unaware her life will change forever.Sissy desires to help her family in their financial trouble and is tired of being treated like a child. After the old man lowers his gun and agrees not to shoot her for stealing, Sissy strikes deal with him. In exchange for eggs, she will work on his farm and clean out his chicken shed.If she sells enough eggs, she can help her family make the five-dollar deposit for electricity and do away with their dangerous kerosene lamps. Her strategy is sound, but of course, nothing goes as planned. A harsh bully, curious parents, unpredictable weather, and a close friend\u2019s troubles make her scheme nearly impossible.Sissy blocks everyone out so her plan will work but, in the process, she cuts out her parents who could help. As her world comes crashing down, she realizes she should have asked for help and wonders how she can fix what is broken.This is an amazing story about hard work, faith, and trust. It deals with tough topics like racism, abuse, poverty, and dishonesty all while staying safe for middle-grade readers.I loved Sissy\u2019s bulldog determination to help her family and protect her friend against prejudiced actions. Sissy's stubborn spirit reminded me of my own and I could see my younger self striving to do things the hard way.If you have young readers at home or in your family, I highly recommend this book. It would be great for any homeschool curriculum because as historical fiction it shows the mindset and differentiating opinions of the war and the culture that thrived in the 1930s. I loved reading Little House On The Prairie growing up and this reminded me of that but with its own flavor of storytelling.I give it 5 stars for cleanliness.5 Stars for keeping interest and tensionAnd 5 stars for staying true to morals and the Christian worldview.",

Experience history through the eyes of twelve-year-old Sissy, as she navigates hardships at home, school, community, and even abroad, as the world processes the horrors happening in Europe.Heart-warming themes of friendship, bravery, and grace are interwoven into the story. While Sissy's life is full of challenges, you will find glimmers of joy throughout. Be sure to keep the tissue box close by, as I know I teared up more than once!I adore that this book is based on a true story, and Carlson artfully brings it to life with her skillful writing. A glossary of historical references is provided at the end of the book, which is very helpful for young readers to grasp this time in history. Discussion questions and activities for each chapter of More than Grit are found on Gretchen Carlson's website, making this a perfect book for any educator.",

In reading More Than Grit, I couldn't help comparing it to Little Britches, the early life of Ralph Moody. Both books made the story of hardship, friendship and forgiveness come alive and magnified the sacrifices needed to overcome not just for the character, but for the good of the family and the community.Sissy's scars didn't make her hide in shame. They made her a protector who measured grace and forgiveness in exemplary fashion. I was rooting for her from page 1.It's too bad teachers no longer read to their classes. If they did, More Than Grit should top the list of reads.",
