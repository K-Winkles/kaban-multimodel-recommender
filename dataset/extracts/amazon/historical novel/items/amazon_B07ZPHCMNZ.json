We follow Naomi May and her family as they leave Missouri for a new life in California.Along the way Naomi and her family encounter loss and love, and learn about the strength and resilience found in family. I laughed, cried, and cheered Naomi through this poignant novel. The only thing this story was wanting for was for it to have more chapters. I didn't want to say goodbye to the characters at the story's conclusion.",

                "reviewText": "Where the Lost Wander is powerful in the most subtle of ways. Amy Harmon takes us on a journey like no other and one I will admit I was hesitant to take. But with a most intense prologue, my interest was piqued in a way I didn't expect. And before I knew it, I was deep into Harmon's exquisite writing and just like Naomi Way and her beloved family and their brutal trek west, I wasn't turning back.Harmon in my opinion, couldn't have written a more timely piece. With this worldwide pandemic strangling our very livelihoods, I almost felt a kindredship towards these weary travelers and their new normal. Even with a pretty decent-sized wagon train, leaving behind all that they knew in Missouri for a new life in California, there were still times of loneliness, monotony and extreme doubt that this was still the right thing to do. The May family is strong, seemingly resilient and full of faith that everything will turn out all right. I couldn't help but feel their inner thoughts and feelings in much the same way I do in this new world of ours, 2020 reflecting some of what they were experiencing in the 1850's.The underlying slow burn romance between Naomi May and one John Lowry gave this book the minute ray of sunshine in an oft-times brutal existence. Living in wagons, never knowing what might lie ahead and traveling a treacherous route, I savored the calm Naomi and John would provide to not only each other but those around them. They have this almost spiritual connection with Naomi understanding John almost immediately. His half-breed existence was never an easy one, being a contentious matter for many around him and yet Naomi became his balm from the first time they laid eyes on each other and only saw his beautiful soul from that moment forward.John's understated nature and the industrious way about him clearly reflected both his upbringing by his hardworking white father and step-mother and his innate sense that came from his indian mother. He's quiet yet is a fierce thinker and he proves over and over again, even to those who don't take kindly to his mixed-race nature that he is worthy of both respect and love. And I just adored how tenacious Naomi was in capturing his heart even as he tried his hardest to resist her. She is a true marvel.Like most other Harmon books, there is much to digest. And with the time-frame being one I wasn't too keen about, I was sure that I'd get lost in archaic verbage that would bring the story down. However, I am the first to admit that I enjoyed learning more about that time and just what early settlers had to endure. Even with loss of life, loss of precious goods and the loss of their will, I was beyond impressed at how each person did their best to carry on even when all felt lost.A true testament to the their strength and grit, I fell hard for this group of characters. It is most definitely Naomi's story, however, taking us along while she continually takes time to illustrate her loved ones, using that talent to thwart many a threat and keep those she loves most close to her heart. I was forever in awe of how she never wavered in her determination, only breaking when it was beyond her control. But her love of her beloved John was truly a godsend and proved to be her savior time and time again. They held each other up, took each other's pain and loved each other with all they had. A true partnership in every sense of the word.Where the Lost Wander touched something in me that I wasn't necessarily always comfortable with but at the same time gave me a renewed hope that this current situation we are in will eventually pass. I wanted to turn away at some of the more excruciating scenes, but knew it was all part of the history that Americans lived through and I felt privileged to be able to witness some of it 'firsthand'.There is an ethereal quality to this book that gave it a magical kind of feel, especially the use of otherworldly dreams whether from the stalwart Winifred May or from the formidable Washakie. When life handed both John and Naomi moments of pure horror and grief those visions were the push both often needed to carry on.I applaud Amy Harmon for taking a part of her own husband's ancestry and crafting a story that brings to life a time that I thought of as a bit dry and dusty as the plains the wagon trails traveled upon. I surprised myself at how much I enjoyed it and it has given me a new outlook in these troubled times, knowing we are always stronger than we may think and that this too shall pass.5+ stars!",

It\u2019s the story of people who chose to leave everything behind on the search for a better life in the west in the 1850\u2019s. It was definitely an emotional rollercoaster. The unforgettable characters were fantastic. Naomi \u201cMany Faces\u201d May was so strong and inspiring. John \u201cTwo Feet\u201d Lowry was just such a beautiful soul. I absolutely loved the May brothers and each and every relationship in the story. The description of the atmosphere was amazing, Amy made me feel like I was on that Oregon trail right next to them.

                "reviewText": "Everytime I open an Amy Harmon book, I am anticipating experiencing one of the best books of the year. Every book she has ever written has never failed to disappoint, and each becomes a new favorite. I knew Where the Lost Wander was going to be an epic read, but what I hadn't prepared for was how captivating it was going to be, how it held you in it's grasp with every written word. Taking note of very little touch, glance, word, hug, whisper, and gesture between the characters, and gobbling them up like it was going to be your last. I wasn't expecting to feel breathless, desperate to know what was going to happen to Naomi and John, but also feeling so aganozied and not wanting to continue for a little while, to live with the May family and little longer.In the very first chapter of the book, we are introduced to the May family. William, Winifred, Will, Warren, Webb, Naomi and little precious Wolfe. It is 1853 and they are searching for a better life, using stagecoaches to cross the overland trail to cross thousands of miles to get to california. Tradgedy strikes the entire, family and Naomi is separated from John. From that point on, the majority of the book takes you back, to the start of their journey, where Naomi meets john, a half white, half Pawnee native who is also known as \"Two Feet\". You fall in love with Webb, the little shoeless warrior. Winifred is the most endearing woman, and William May, whose love for his family shines throughout the book. Knowing what was going to befall the family was so hard. The more I fell in love with them, the more I didn't want to continue. I wanted the family to strive through the hardships of the trail and come out whole at the end. It was hard. My heart hurt. My stomach felt knotted and my heart oh so heavy.But Amy Harmon creates such a vivid, beautiful experience. It was like you were living the book, experiencing the trail for yourself, experiencing the fear, and the courage it took to cross that trail for months on end. And while there is romance, this story is SO MUCH MORE. It is about hardships and hope, life and death, perseverance and survival. The love of a family. And it's also about heritage, where you come from, where your home is but also feeling like your in two places at once and don't belong anywhwere. And then finding your place in the love of another.This is historical fiction unlike anything I have ever read. I am so in love with this book, with these characters and the stories they had to tell. I loved how I felt like I was learning a part of our history I really never knew before. And I especially love that Amy Harmon didn't hold back. She gives it to you, all of it. Life isn't pretty, and it most definitly wasn't back then. But you learn, you grow, you survive. This story was hard, but it was beautiful.I can't say enough of this book. It was everything I hoped for and never knew I needed. Amy Harmon has outdone herself!",
