            "Editorial Reviews Review In his latest graphic novel adaptation of a classic text, Hinds (The Odyssey) condenses Homer\u2019s epic poem of gods and mortals at war, covering most of the major events and adding supplemental material that expands the story slightly beyond the original...The most striking scenes are the battles, presented in intimate detail and in awe-inspiring, sweeping overviews. Hinds\u2019s relatively plain language retains just enough meter to hint at the cadences of the work, and, together with the dynamic art, creates an accessible entr\u00e9e to an enduring classic.\u2014Publishers Weekly (starred review)Clear scaffolding, well-chosen abridgements, readable prose, and stunning art invite readers into this exceptionally compelling version of the episode of the Trojan War handed down through Homer\u2019s Iliad...Readers who have struggled to follow the poetry of the standard text or to become emotionally invested in a summary will have no such difficulty here; Hinds has truly produced an easy-to-follow, engrossingly cinematic blockbuster on the page.\u2014Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books (starred review)\"Sing to me, O Muse, of the rage of Achilles\": a rousing graphic rendition of Homer's great epic...An expertly crafted rendition and a welcome invitation to younger readers to immerse themselves in the ancient past.\u2014Kirkus ReviewsThis modern graphic novel retelling of Homer\u2019s epic immediately draws in readers with its artistry and readability...This is a well-done adaptation of an important, thought-provoking poem.\u2014School Library ConnectionAs with his treatment of The Odyssey (rev. 11/10), Hinds offers an ambitious and compelling comics adaptation of a Homerian epic...By highlighting the efforts of the goddesses, along with amending Helen\u2019s understanding of her role in the war, Hinds makes an effort to address the story\u2019s inherent hypermasculinity, reminding readers that \u201cthe war is the work of angry gods and angry men.\u201d\u2014The Horn BookArrestingly, Mr. Hinds depicts the meddling immortals in translucent, sugary Easter-egg colors. This initially whimsical-seeming decision has the effect of highlighting the mocking distance between the fickle, impulsive Olympians and the flesh-and-blood men and women who pay the price for divine caprice on the earth below...Those who know the epic will find an engrossing and rewarding account: gory, affecting, unforgettable.\u2014The Wall Street JournalUnpacking \u2018The Iliad\u2019 as a reader is one thing; adapting it for comics is a hurdle of a different magnitude. Enter Gareth Hinds, the Vermont-born artist who has reworked literary classics from Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe and more. His magnificently realized graphic telling of \u2018The Iliad\u2019 \u2014 in its wealth of muted watercolored hues and evocative landscapes \u2014 condenses a more than 20-book-length poem into 251 pages of narrative comics. It follows an equally sweeping interpretation of \u201cThe Odyssey,\u201d which had a loose, sketchbook-style look as compared with its spiffy successor.\u2014Los Angeles TimesThis is no mere comics adaptation of an ancient classic. Through his intricately illustrated panels, Gareth Hinds brings us The Iliad\u2019s depth, brutality, and power. A Herculean effort worthy of the original.\u2014Gene Luen Yang, Michael L. Printz Award winner for American Born ChineseWith his graphic novel retelling of The Iliad, Gareth Hinds has created a work of such scope and power that it boggles my mind. It truly lives up to the \u2014 dare I say it \u2014 epic scale of the original poem.\u2014George O\u2019Connor, author of the New York Times best-selling Olympians series About the Author Gareth Hinds is the acclaimed creator of the graphic novels The Odyssey, Poe, Beowulf, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, and King Lear. He lives near Washington, D.C."

The author\u2019s notes clarify that the Iliad was written several centuries after the fact of the Trojan War and that the story had been passed down as poem and song in a long oral tradition. It was eventually written down, probably by several \u201cbards of the Homeric tradition.\u201d There are several translations of the Iliad so there is not any definitive \u201coriginal.\u201dAs a scholar and teacher, I generally want students to read original works of literature but, when I see the depth of detail and the close adherence to what we believe to be the \u201coriginal\u201d author\u2019s intent and meaning in Gareth Hines\u2019 graphic historical novels, I think they are outstanding versions of fine literature for teens and adults.",

The art style maintains the right amount of realism to maintain the weight of the original work and the novel captures the drama and emotions extremely well. It makes the Illiad feel like a war story, which is arguably what it always was, showing the valor of those who fight, but also emphasizing the loss and tragedy of such brutal conflict, making sure to name every warrior lost in the fighting for example. Definitely recommended if you're a graphic novel fan or are interested in a unique version of the Illiad.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, I am biased: I believe that The Iliad is both the pinnacle and the foundation for all Western literature, and one of life's great joys for me was learning to read the immortal words of Homer in ancient Greek when I was a teenager. So imagine the thrill of seeing those immortal words translated into a graphic format! This is a complex tale, told in complex language, with an impossibly wide cast of characters in a culture that seems far away from our modern world, and yet it all comes alive on the pages of this graphic novel, just as relevant to our current events now as it was almost 3000 years ago. I am the parent of two students with learning challenges, and I am using this book to make the classics accessible to them. There is nothing simple or easy about the Iliad. The author streamlines the story somewhat, and uses different types of visual cues and reader guides to facilitate reading comprehension. At the same time, the author uses many of Homer's narrative tricks to bring specific moments to life. This book does contain plenty of violence, human trafficking and references to rape (it's about a war), so parents should exercise their judgement about appropriateness for children or young teens. It's approximately a 7th grade reading level. But it's ideal for getting young adventure-lovers hooked on heavy-hitting literature - definitely not for the Charlotte's Web crowd. As soon as the book arrived on my doorstep, I went straight to the scene of Priam clasping the knees of Achilles, and it was exactly as I'd hoped, exactly as Homer describes it. That scene answers some of life's big questions: How do you forgive the unforgivable? What does it mean to be human? What does anything mean? The author's artwork includes some archaeological touches from the time period of the Trojan War, very nice to see. The overall effect is stunning, and captures the spirit of Homer's epic poem. I didn't think the author could possibly top his editions of Beowulf, King Lear or The Odyssey, but here it is: the cornerstone of Western literature. Highly recommended for adults, teens and tweens who are curious about this ancient tale.",

                "reviewText": "Gareth Hinds has successfully captured the essence of The Iliad, and arguably even more impressive, at the same time made the story accessible to a much larger audience than ever before. On top of this, the story retains it's artistry, so the reader is treated to a high quality retelling, which while using basic English, does not condescend to the reader.Mr. Hind's works are excellent for teaching these stories to English learning students in ELA classes, or in ESL classes. They would even benefit a reader who is reading a translation of the original text, who may be unfamiliar with the history, or the conventions of literature of Antiquity.Even the illustration clearly involved careful consideration and attention to detail, and walks a balance between accuracy to the text and historical context, and assisting the reader to visualize the action. For example, in the interest of allowing the reader to more easily recognize major characters, the first letter of their name is cleverly and subtly worked into the character's armor or vestments. Also, all of the Greeks wear read, while the Trojans are all clad in blue.It is hard to overstate the value of this master work by Hinds. There is no reader of the Iliad who cannot appreciate the deep level of respect with which Hinds has treated Homer's epic.",

                "reviewText": "A picture is worth a thousand words, and this version of the classic tale is full of detailed images, drawn with love. Hinds doesn't limit himself to merely telling the story, he also shows us maps of the ancient locations, and provides a detalied explanation of the context of this famed trojan war. He provides a near exhaustive list of all the characters involved, and their respective feats (or defeats) in the plains of ancient Troy. Some consider this attention to detail as detrimental, but I consider it entirely positive.This is not necessarily a children's book (though it is rather child friendly) as it is full of blood and violence, and some sexual references, though never in a distasteful manner.In conclusion, this new adaptation by Gareth Hinds a great, innovative version of the classic tale. Filled with both words and images, it captures the depth of The Iliad while also captivating our minds with wonderful illustrations. Do not pay attention to the bad reviews, this is a very enjoyable version, well worth the price. Even as an 8 year old, I believe I would have greatly enjoyed this book. Reccommended for all lovers of history, greeks (or achaeans as Homer called them) and ancient battles.",
