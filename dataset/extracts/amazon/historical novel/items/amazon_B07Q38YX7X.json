        "description": "Il Mulino. An old crumbling mill, by a winding river, nestled in the Tuscan mountains. An empty home that holds memories of homemade pasta and Nonna\u2019s stories by the fire, and later: the Nazi invasion, and a family torn apart by a heartbreaking betrayal.Anna is distraught when her beloved mother, Ines, passes away. She inherits a box of papers, handwritten in Italian and yellowed with age, and a tantalising promise that the truth about what happened during the war lies within.The diaries lead Anna to the small village of Rofelle, where she slowly starts to heal as she explores sun-kissed olive groves, and pieces together her mother\u2019s past: happy days spent herding sheep across Tuscan meadows cruelly interrupted when World War Two erupted and the Nazis arrived; fleeing her home to join the Resistenza; and risking everything to protect an injured British soldier who captured her heart. But Anna is no closer to learning the truth: what sent Ines running from her adored homeland?When she meets an elderly Italian gentleman living in a deserted hamlet, who flinches at her mother\u2019s name and refuses to speak English, Anna is sure he knows more about the devastating secret that tore apart her mother\u2019s family. But in this small Tuscan community, some wartime secrets were never meant to be uncovered\u2026A stunning tale, inspired by true events, about how the tragic consequences of war can echo through generations, and how love can guide us through the darkest times.

Although this is a fiction story, many of the things she talks about in this book really did happen. Many of the massacres she talks about are authentic. It is inspired by the stories of her Mother-in-law who fell in love and married an English soldier in 1944 in Italy. Angela also leaves a list of materials she used to create this story.Anna was at a crossroads in her life. She was without a job, without a boyfriend, and her mother had died. At the reading of the will, she had received fifty thousand pounds and a box of papers which would be delivered to her later. Her brother received the family home and her sister her mother\u2019s jewelry. It seemed just right to her as she had always felt left out of the family. Her siblings were so much older than she was. Was she a mistake as her siblings had told her growing up or a special gift as her Mother told her? When she received the box, she found her Mother had left her life story for her. However, it was pieced together in journals, school notebooks, a pillow case and anything else she could write on. Part of it was in English; but the majority was in Italian. How was she to read this? It would take her forever to translate it.She decided to go to her mother\u2019s hometown in Italy and try to learn more about her Italian background. Maybe she could get someone there to translate it. What would she find there?The book is fabulous and well-written. It is definitely one which should be read by those interested in history and love.",

I don\u2019t equate romance with porn! She used the Italian word agritourismo CONSTANTLY!!! I really wanted her to just STOP and call it the English name already. The story was good, but she was supposed to be reading a diary. It sounded like a novelist writing a descriptive event and very unrealistic. To finish the story I had to pretend I was just reading the story of two women and not a diary that was supposed to be scribbled on bits and pieces in a box.",

The characters are richly drawn, the Italian village comes alive in your imagination and the description of the location, houses and local food/meals is exceptionally described. Having owned and operated a Bed and Breakfast, I especially appreciated the attention to detail of the amazing meals. I have long read historical fiction from this time period and this book made it's way to a top spot on my very favorites list. It describes in detail the struggles endured both in Italy and England during the war and the sacrifices made by so many. I look forward with much anticipation to reading the other books by this author. Solid five stars!",

                "reviewText": "I disagree strongly with the bad reviews about this novel and agree wholeheartedly with the great reviews.I love a good history book and gravitate towards World War 2 stories. I could not put this book down. It will now be in my top 10 World War fiction favorites.Character development was fabulous. I fell in love with Anna and her mother Ines. But it wasn't just those two that I fell in love with. Her descriptions of Italy, the countryside and the historical landmarks were wonderful as well. Truly a captivating read. The anguish, pain and horror of the war tore at my heart. A very emotional read. I will definitely seek out more novels by Angela Petch. I am very happy I stumbled across this book and Ms Petch and I am very happy I ignored the bad reviews.",

                "reviewText": "A beautiful, tragic story set in wartime Italy and the present day. When Anna's mother dies, she leaves her daughter a set of diaries she wrote when she was younger, with precious details of her life. Anna decides to go to Tuscany to retrace her mother's footsteps and find out more.The author leads us along shaded mountain paths, past abandoned villages decimated by German retaliation, lets us paddle in a cool, refreshing stream that can turn into a raging torrent in the blink of an eye, shelters with us in a decrepit old barn, until we finally reach the old mulino where Anna's mother grew up. Each detail is breathtakingly described, with every scene you are drawn further back into the past and the lives of the people who lived at that time.The two stories, both Anna's and Ines', are slowly revealed, peeling away layers until the bare core remains. There are tears, tragedy, and heartfelt moments that keep you enthralled right to the end. Highly recommend.",
