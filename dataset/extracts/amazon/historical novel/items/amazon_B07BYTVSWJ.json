                "reviewText": "If you are already a fan of Donna Russo Morin\u2019s award-winning historical fiction, then you know you\u2019re in for a treat with Gilded Summers. As with her other historical fiction, such as her trilogy Da Vinci\u2019s Disciples, we are shown the past through the flesh and blood characters\u2019 lives and stories. We immediately become immersed in their time and place\u2014their lives are real lives, like our own. While Russo Morin\u2019s research is impeccable, it does not distract but enhances our immersion. In Gilded Summers, two girls become women together even though they are forbidden the intense friendship they conceive and defend. Pearl is the daughter of members of Gilded Age society, a family so vastly rich that they own two mansions: one in the \u201ccottage\u201d neighborhood of Newport, RI, and one in Manhattan. Ginerva is an Italian immigrant newly arrived in America, a girl who must serve Pearl\u2019s family and Pearl herself. Pearl struggles to fulfill her longing to become an artist\u2014a goal forbidden by her social-climbing mother. The talented, hardworking Ginerva designs clothes and dreams of earning her living as a fashion designer\u2014a goal kept out of reach by her low status, sex, and lack of education. The girls help one another keep their dreams alive as they grow into womanhood. Enter two young men\u2014both society gentlemen\u2014attractive to the young women, one corruptly attracted to both young women. The events that follow have the power to shatter the women\u2019s lives, let alone their friendship. The women\u2019s actions, mistakes, and feelings are relatable as they struggle to survive the worst the world has to offer young women. The ending is as satisfying as it is unexpected. This reader can only hope that Russo Morin is planning a sequel.",

                "reviewText": "Fact and fiction come together to tell the upstairs -downstairs stories of Ginevra, a young Italian immigrant girl, and Pearl, the debutante daughter, as they come of age at the turn of the 20th century in the glittering splendor of Newport. It's a good story that held my interest, though the writing could have been stronger and It definitely needed a good copy editor. Living in Rhode Island not far from Newport, I appreciated that the description, geography, and history of time, place, and prominent families were accurate. The two main characters and their families were fictional, as were the murder and trial depicted in the novel; however, Tessie Oehlrich, Mamie Fish, and Alva and Consuelo Vanderbilt (and others who appear) were very real, as was the society depicted by the author. Ms. Morin lives in Newport, and it shows, based on the level of authenticity demonstrated. I had pictured \"The Beeches\" as The Elms, and indeed, The author states she used it as the model for Pearl's family's cottage. The proofreading and copy editing, however, were sorely needed. There was WAY too much repetition of hackneyed and pseudo-foreshadowing phrases along the lines of, \"It would be the first time, but not the last,\" \" I would remember this moment forever, \" and \"If only I had,\" usually appearing at the end of a chapter. There were also too many words misused and sentence fragments; I'm not sure if this came from the digitization, or whether the novel was self-published, or just sloppiness or laziness. But c'mon - the SPROUTING Rock Bathing Association - one error that particularly sticks in my mind. Overall a good read, but I do wish more care had been taken with its execution.",

                "reviewText": "Gilded Summers, beautifully written by Donna Russo, perfectly captures the dichotomy and similarity of women in the Guilded Age in Newport, Rhode Island. Pearl and Ginevra, seemingly so distant in terms of their upbringing, social status and life circumstance, discover that they both yearn for a life determined by their own passions, not the confines of their birthright. The unlikely, yet heartwarming bond between servant and debutant shatters the notion that social status defines or limits deep friendship. Theirs is a story of defiance, determination, passion and self truth. WIth the glorious coastal location set amid spectacular and lavish \"summer cottages\", the author's gift of stunning description captures the essence of beautiful Newport. Those familiar with the area will deeply appreciate the historical information of Newport woven into the pages. In this era of celebrating and recognizing strength in women, Gilded Summers, and author Russo, remind us that this strength, though overshadowed in years past, has been a driving force throughout the ages.",

                "reviewText": "This could be a good book if the author had taken even a tiny bit of trouble understanding the period she is writing about. From a number of absurd statements, such as on poor Italian villagers starting their days with espresso in the 1890s to the modern views on accents and diversity, to how big houses were run in the 1890s to the underlying modern premise of women empowerment during the period described, the book is fool of anachronisms. I can see the same story working much better if positioned 80 years later in time.",

                "reviewText": "There were many things I liked about this book. Th introduction of each section headed by the name of one the two main characters helped the reader keep track of who was narrating the events. The character development, plot, descriptions and sequence of storyline was well done. The intrigue of the upper classes and the \u2018gossipy\u2019 aspects of their shenanigans were entertaining and engaging. Actual historical issues of the day were woven into the story which added to its authenticity. The book stretched my imagination and made me wonder about what happened to the two main characters at the end, which was cleverly dubbed \u2018the beginning\u2019. A thoroughly good read.",
