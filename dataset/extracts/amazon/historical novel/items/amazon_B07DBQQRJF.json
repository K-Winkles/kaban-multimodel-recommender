She had wisdom, and she loved her family. Unfortunately some of her family didn't love her. I was hooked from the beginning. My heart went out to Cissy and her Grandmother, who really did love her ,and was her salvation. I enjoyed the book, until the very end. The ending was not the ending, and it left you hang. Finish the story. What happened between mother and daughter and where was the forgiveness? You really could of fleshed out the end of the story. I read to the end and had all these questions and feelings left unanswered. Running away with Grandma's money, just didn't cut it for me. Because of the ending, I would not recommend this book.",

                "reviewText": "This book far exceeded my expectations and submerged me into a story that feels so topical today, with the rise of the #MeToo movement. As the acknowledgment indicates, the author wrote the first draft of this story years ago, but today, the timeliness of this release is uncanny, providing a personal, heart-wrenching rendering of the type of psychological damage incurred by girls and young women who are the victims of sexual abuse. Our hero, Cissy, seems a precocious oddball, who in reality has turned inward to deal with the horrific years-long abuse by her father. She's a woman-child who deals with her own crisis by turning inward to make sense of a protective God amidst her horrific experience, and to voracious reading to develop her own narrative and sense of right and wrong. The character of her grandmother, Janelle, is a beautifully drawn, and even though we love her from the get-go, it just keeps getting better and better as we learn more about her fiery devotion and what led her to instinctively protect her granddaughter. The book is a compassionate rendering of the tragedy, survival and triumph of women who bond over these common experiences and come out on top, refusing to be defined by those who rob them of their physical innocence.",
