                "reviewText": "So many times, history forgets the incredibly brave and resourceful women who fought in WW2 against the Nazis.Reading the sample text Amazon provides, it was obvious most of the book was written in 1st person. Normally I don't go for that, but as Amanda Lees has the well-deserved reputation of being an excellent author, I was willing to give it a shot and....OMG, from the first page, I was riveted to the storyline. Other reviewers here have shared the details, so I'll simply say that being transported into the world of WW2 via the vivid descriptions... and visualizing in my mind the courageous women who made a huge difference in the war was quite frankly, a gift. It was like I could literally *see* the action taking place... and the women (gutsy, undaunted no matter what happened) ignored their own safety to rescue their loved ones and fight for their own country.Highly recommended... so glad this is part of a series so more will be coming down the road!",

I would fight for my husband, my children, my girlfriends, the family I love, the honorable people who are just trying to make a living. I am inspired by the underdog winning against tyranny and tyrants. Radicalism is dangerous because it replaces common sense and decency. We have witnessed it even in some of our own friends or family who lose the ability to reason for themselves. WWII was a lesson we must remember.Amanda Lees has captured the essence of how some will dedicate their very lives to preserve freedom. Some will be weakened by the presumption that they are superior to their fellow man. Those who are the least honorable reach for power wherever and whenever they can. Often they win power for a while, but abusing others always has a cost. We was readers want those who are evil to get their due.Thankfully we know who won that war, but Amanda reminds us that freedom comes at a cost and we get to know those we never met in life, because Amanda brought their examples to life in her storytelling.",

                "reviewText": "Possible Spoilers!Thank you so much to NetGalley and Amanda Lees for providing me with a complimentary digital audiobook ARC for The Silence Before Dawn coming out September 13, 2022. The honest opinions expressed in this review are my own.Marianne has worked as a resistance worker for months in 1944 Nazi occupied France. She carries out missions from a remote farm in Provence. But one night they are ambushed as German soldiers scatter, capture or kill every person there. Mourning the loss of her friends, Marianne fights to go on and survive. Her secret agent life as been compromised, but she must go on. Her fianc\u00e9 Jack was seized by the Butcher of Lyon. Marianne must race against time to find him and prove he isn\u2019t the traitor who betrayed them.With her fellow women agents at her side, she sets out on a dangerous mission to save Jack. Can she win the battle to win the war or will her efforts be in vain?Overall, I enjoyed this story. I\u2019ve read quite a few WWII books. It\u2019s one of my favorite subjects to study. I admire all the efforts of the brave men and women who fought during the war. There were so many who were just ordinary civilians but they fought to protect themselves, their families and their country.It kind of felt like the plot to the movie Charlotte Gray. I really love that movie, but this book wasn\u2019t what I was expecting. There was more romance than I thought. I know Marianne was a strong character who accomplished a lot, but sometimes she seemed to come off as a bit arrogant. I think the plot has to do with that as well. Because her whole mission is to save her fianc\u00e9, it makes it seem as if her character is reduced to that, instead of all of her work as a spy for the resistance. It\u2019s not a bad thing and I know she was trying to take down the Lyon, but I kind of wish there was a little more to it. I just think there was something missing for me. It didn\u2019t seem like it was much of a group effort and it was mostly about Marianne and Jack.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys WWII romance resistance stories.",

Not normally the type of book i would read, but the strong storyline, even stronger female leads and a good pace to it made it something that has to be finished. An exciting start to the series, role in the next book",

They were exceedingly brave.This author has significantly exaggerated the roles played by the French Resistance. Male and female. There simply weren\u2019t that many that really took on the Nazis, especially in Vichy France. However, the author states that this is a work of fiction and it certainly is.",
