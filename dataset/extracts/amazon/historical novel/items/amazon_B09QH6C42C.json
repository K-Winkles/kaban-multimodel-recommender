Equal parts hilarious and heartbreaking, this is the story of an irrepressible boy nobody wants, but readers will love.\u201d (Ron Charles, Washington Post)From the acclaimed author of The Poisonwood Bible and The Bean Trees, a brilliant novel that enthralls, compels, and captures the heart as it evokes a young hero\u2019s unforgettable journey to maturitySet in the mountains of southern Appalachia, Demon Copperhead is the story of a boy born to a teenaged single mother in a single-wide trailer, with no assets beyond his dead father\u2019s good looks and copper-colored hair, a caustic wit, and a fierce talent for survival. Relayed in his own unsparing voice, Demon braves the modern perils of foster care, child labor, derelict schools, athletic success, addiction, disastrous loves, and crushing losses. Through all of it, he reckons with his own invisibility in a popular culture where even the superheroes have abandoned rural people in favor of cities.Many generations ago, Charles Dickens wrote David Copperfield from his experience as a survivor of institutional poverty and its damages to children in his society. Those problems have yet to be solved in ours. Dickens is not a prerequisite for listeners of this novel, but he provided its inspiration. In transposing a Victorian epic novel to the contemporary American South, Barbara Kingsolver enlists Dickens\u2019 anger and compassion, and above all, his faith in the transformative powers of a good story. Demon Copperhead speaks for a new generation of lost boys, and all those born into beautiful, cursed places they can\u2019t imagine leaving behind. Read more",

                "reviewText": "In an interview with Ezra Klein on his podcast, Barbara Kingsolver said she wanted to write \u201cthe great Appalachian novel.\u201d She conceded, however, that the notion \u201cprobably sounds ridiculous.\u201dIn particular, Kingsolver said she wanted to write about the fact that the people who live in Appalachia \u201care the most resourceful Americans you\u2019re probably going to find anywhere.\u201d Kingsolver, who was raised in rural Kentucky and now lives in rural Virginia, said she wanted to explore the shame she had internalized from her choice of a place to live.\u201cHow many people well-meaning people have asked me, \u2018how could I live there in the middle of nowhere?\u2019\u201d said Kingsolver. \u201cPeople, this is my everywhere. This is my everything.\u201dLater in the chat: \u201cEverybody looks down on the country people and the country people sort of absorb that. You can\u2019t help but absorb it. So when I set out to write my great Appalachian novel. I was paralyzed with self-doubt because, I mean, my starting point was that I wanted to write about the opioid epidemic, which is become a huge assault on our culture, our families, our communities. It\u2019s devastated so many of the good things about this region that we value and that we love. And so I wanted to write about these kids who\u2019ve been damaged and this place that\u2019s been damaged, and it seemed like a really hopelessly sad story. Plus, it\u2019s about people that I didn\u2019t feel the outer world cared about. And so I just really, I spent a couple of years walking around and around this story, trying to figure out how to break into that house because I really felt sure nobody wants to read it.\u201dWell, Kingsolver was wrong. At least, she was wrong about the interest in her topic\u2014not her take on the people of Appalachia. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and 85,000+ ratings on Amazon (4.6 stars).There\u2019s so much to like about Demon Copperhead but one of the main things is that it\u2019s so breezily readable. For a 546-page epic, it goes down fast. It\u2019s episodic, a la Dickens, but the character flow is organic, unforced. Demon\u2019s voice is engaging and his struggles are real, particularly when it comes to the challenges of the foster care system and the brutality of OxyContin addictions. Kingsolver\u2019s empathy for addicts comes pouring out of the story. She is non-judgmental, plays it straight.Here is Demon, somewhat early on, looking back on the power of addiction: \u201cI had roads to travel before I would know it\u2019s not that simple, the dope versus the person you love. That a craving can ratchet itself up and up inside a body and a mind, at the same time that body\u2019s strength for tolerating is favorite drug goes down and down. That the longer you\u2019ve gone hurting between fixes, the higher the odds that you\u2019ll reach too hard for the stars next time. That first big rush of relief could be your last. In the long run, that\u2019s how I\u2019ve come to picture Mom at the end: reaching as hard as her little body would stretch, trying to touch the blue sky, reaching for some peace.\u201dThat\u2019s as good a passage about the feeling of addiction, and a description of its power, that I\u2019ve ever read. (Kingsolver also read that section on Klein\u2019s podcast.)Kingsolver is a deceiving writer. Her style is unassuming and keen-eyed. The text is full of specificity. And energy. If you have any doubts about tackling this book because it looks too heavy, squash those notions. Here\u2019s the beginning of Chapter 34:\u201cA lot of firsts that school year. First scrimmage, first JV game, first tackle, first passing yards made. First school dance, with an eighth-grader girl that was dead serious about it. So, my first real date, evidently. Angus and Sax went together dressed as Planet of the Apes, loser of their grade contest (Sax) being the human on a leash. This is Homecoming mind you, not Halloween, so. Not a date. But Angus took mine over, ordered the corsage from Walmart, took me to Goodwill where we found this dope white suit from the sixties. In my size, unbelievable. I\u2019ve grown into my hands and feet by this point, and I\u2019m pushing 6 feet. Thank you, Mattie Kate.\u201dMattie Kate is the housekeeper who worked for football Coach Wingate, where Demon lived while he was being developed as a potential football star. There are plenty of characters to keep track of, but Kingsolver gives them juicy nicknames (again, a la Dickens) or colorful descriptions so they are easy to track. U-Haul. Fast Forward. Waddles. Mouse. If you know David Copperfield (it\u2019s been decades since I read it) you\u2019ll have a great time with what Kingsolver did with her names. For instance, Uriah Heep becomes Ryan Pyles.The \u201cresourcefulness\u201d of Demon is apparent in his stubborn ability to survive. He\u2019s smarter than he acknowledges, and very observant. In Demon Copperhead, bad things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people, too. Many around Demon are not so fortunate and literally or metaphorically drown. You can\u2019t help but think about the failure of our institutions around child welfare, the foster care system, adult welfare, and drug abuse. But Demon finds his talent, develops a passion, and puts it to use. Hello, the power of art. And love. Every great novel, and this is one, is a love story in the end.Demon Copperfield was written with passion for Kingsolver\u2019s very personal reasons. The execution is a thing of beauty\u2014and something we can all admire.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Easily one of the best books I read this year.",
                "reviewText": "\"Demon Copperhead\" kept and kept on appearing in my \"suggested for you\" on Kindle, and each time, I kept thinking \"Ugh, not so much, I just want something to read, but not sure if I really feel like turning on my thinking cap for Barbara Kingsolver.\" Finally, largely out of self-defense as I was so tired of seeing it, I caved and got the book. When I look back on all that I have read this year, or even over the past couple to few years, I can't imagine not having read it.This book has been called a creative retelling of \"David Copperfield.\" As to that, I will begin by saying not \"I was born,\" but something far more provocative: I don't like Dickens. Sorry, I don't, despite having taken (or possibly because of having taken) an entire Senior English Seminar on his works in college. In that semester-long class, I was exposed to most of everything he'd written, including \"David Copperfield,\" and did what I had to do to participate in classroom discussion and achieve a grade. Shortly after that, I largely forgot \"David Copperfield\" and its characters or situations, so I read \"Demon Copperhead\" cover-to-cover without recognizing the parallels. It wasn't until after I finished the book and took a quick trip to Wikipedia that I saw how creatively these were done, from plot events to character names, and was impressed. (And for those reviewers who have said this is \"plagiarism,\" no, a retelling of an existing story is not plagiarism.)Rather than Dickens' coal-choked, vice-ridden, poverty-stricken 19th century London, the setting has been transported here to Appalachian Virginia, more or less in the present day. The titular character's surroundings are beautifully done, as Kingsolver's descriptions always are, and the reader is immediately immersed in his life's adventures and misadventures, from young childhood to young adulthood.I found the narrative voice of his childhood to be particularly effective. A child's perceptions of his world, however intuitive, are often incorrect or entirely made up based on emotions such as love or fear. Child Demon's voice felt very believable to me (and many times was cause for a chuckle, a chuckle not being easy to come by in a story with as many dark themes as this one has). From there, it is interesting to read a gifted writer changing the narrative voice as the character gets older.As always, always, always (and my favorite attribute of Barbara Kingsolver's writing), the descriptions of nature are wonderful and meticulously detailed, especially as seen through the perception of a child. (In one example, the character Maggot is observed by Demon to be holding a tiny, tiny grasshopper, so small it seemed to have come from \"a planet of smaller things.\")In being with Demon from childhood into young adulthood, we see a character who goes from fearing Boogeymen which live largely in his imagination to confronting Boogeymen which are real -- in this case poverty, the flaws of the foster care system, the manipulation of the people of this region by big business and government, and the horrors of the opioid crisis.I came across a number of reviews from readers who felt the depiction of the latter was one-sided and had very strong opinions about it -- I'm not here to debate that -- or that the themes of the book were too heavy-handed. And granted, while many (self included) believe that some of Barbara's Kingsolver's books are too heavy-handed in terms of social or ecological agendas, I felt this was much more subtle in \"Demon Copperhead\" and did not find the themes overbearing at all -- possibly because the reader is experiencing things through the eyes of a very well-developed character, rather than through the words or actions of less-developed characters in some of her other books where characters feel like devices and not people.Some say Dickens beat readers over the head with themes, too. Much as he may not be my favorite writer, however, I feel that he did a good enough job of creating a world and characters that he didn't have to beat anyone over the head with anything. I feel Kingsolver has achieved that here, too. Understanding the ugliness of a society as perceived by a believable character -- and feeling sad, appalled, ashamed, what-have-you -- is not the same as being hit over the head by something.There's some dark, dark stuff here, so fair warning: readers who aren't prepared for that had best pick up another selection. And if this isn't your cup of tea, please do that rather than drag down reviews of this one with expressions of shock about the \"trash\" herein. Things like sex, death by OD, people shooting up, etc., are part of this story.As others have said, however, I am flabbergasted by the fact that Amazon's age suggestion for this book is \"ages 9 and up.\" While there may be 9-year-olds at a reading level sufficient to comprehend the words, this book is *not* kid stuff.While a 70% five-star rating is a suggestion of the widespread appreciation for \"Demon Copperhead,\" there are, as always, other percentages of readers who liked it less or even hated it (which is the beauty of the right to freely express an opinion, or to admit that something is simply not to one's taste).If I had a nickel for every review that said this was a horrible book or a suggestion that Kingsolver has fallen off her game and ended by saying \"Go read 'The Poisonwood Bible',\" I'd be a rich reader indeed.I'll end by saying I *did* \"go read 'The Poisonwood Bible'.\" (Twice, actually, well before reading this one.) And this reader liked \"Demon Copperhead\" way better.",

It hits the trifecta: Lee County, poor white culture in the Appalachian, soaks into every word: we see it all, hear it all, feel it all. And then it is America and its dreams, and then it is everyone. Along the way, is a concerto with Dickens providing the orchestra to Demon Copperhead's soloist. There are a few books that change lives. This is one of them.",

A heart breaking story yet it is written with wit and warmth. It's multi-layered with an insight into the realities of life in life in 'hick country' America and the opioid crisis. On every page of this book you can feel Demon's hope and desperation, his struggles to make to make sense of life and to make the 'right' decisions.In boyhood and growing into adulthood somehow the author manages to portray these stages so vividly and so beautifully. When I read the reviews I assumed it would not live up to the hype but it does and so much more.",
