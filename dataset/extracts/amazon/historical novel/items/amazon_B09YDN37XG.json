                "reviewText": "This is a historical/literary novel set in Kentucky coal country during the Great Depression.I am more than a quarter of the way through it and I still haven\u2019t encountered a major conflict to hold my attention.No one can deny that author Annie Blaylock writes well. Her prose is first-rate. Her dialogue is realistic and shows that she has a wonderful \u201cear.\u201d She does a great job with her settings, giving readers a real feel of what rural life in 1930s Appalachia must have been like. Kudos to her for all that.But for a story to work, at least for me, there must be a compelling conflict. Characters have to want or need things\u2014preferably desperately--and there has to be a pretty serious obstacle standing in the way. Gatsby wanted Daisy, but his poverty and America\u2019s class system blocked him. Ahab wanted to wreak vengeance upon Moby Dick and was prevented from doing so by the vagaries of the sea and by \u2026 well \u2026 Moby Dick.Here, it\u2019s difficult to tell what anyone wants. Indeed, it\u2019s difficult to tell who the main protagonist is, since the novel\u2019s focus shifts among characters. Yes, everyone must survive the Depression; and Ms. Blaylock does a credible job depicting various strategies for doing so. Yes, I\u2019m seeing what it takes for people to live their lives in that time and place. But that\u2019s all I\u2019m seeing: a diffuse set of encounters that tell me what life was like but don't tell me a compelling story. It\u2019s not enough to make me want to continue.Nevertheless, I'm giving this three stars because the quality of the writing is high and because there may be those who will enjoy it simply for that reason.",

                "reviewText": "This book is just \u2018the best thing since pockets on a dress\u2019. It was a joy to read. Wonderfully written in words that \u2018travel like dandelion seeds. There\u2019s no controlling where they\u2019ll fly\u2019.A story set in the 1930\u2019s in the Appalachian Mountains, in a \u2018nook of the world that was like the small end of a telescope\u2019. The author writes in such a way as to perfectly capture the mood and language of the place and times. Great characters and plenty of plot, that unwinds in \u2018the spool of telling\u2019.This is a book that will catch you by the tail and \u2018fill up your chest with air and a curious lightness\u2019.Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Another book about a packhorse librarian, but quite different to the one I had read before. It's an interesting period in history, and a great setting with the poverty and depravation in the area after the Great Depression. FDR and Eleanor had some great ideas and the packhorse librarians was quite off the wall. I enjoyed most of the writing and character development although some parts felt a bit too much like a text book rather than a novel. The rough country justice was excellent but I could have done without that tapeworm! A great YA read although it's not described as such.",
