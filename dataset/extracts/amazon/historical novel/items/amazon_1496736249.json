                "reviewText": "The Spanish Daughter by Lorena Hughes was a very good and interesting book. It is based on Historical events so the details the author brought in were both interesting and great to learn about. It takes place in the 1920's where Maria Purificacion de LaFont-Puri the daughter of a Spanish mother and French father is the main character. The Father, Don Armand has deserted the family to go to Ecuador to start a Cacao farm and becomes very wealthy. The book begins after Puri is married and her mother has died. They are traveling to Ecuador to take over her legacy of the farm after her fathers death. All begins as her husband is murdered on the ship but the killer is meant for Puri. She decides that she is in danger and assumes her husbands identity and tells all that Puri was killed. Upon arriving she finds out her father had remarried and has 2 daughter and a son. The story proceeds as Puri, as her husband tries to find out who wanted her dead. The details of the Cacao farm and of Ecuador are interesting and the story continues with her hunt for who is wanting her gone. Puri was a Choclatier back in Spain and had a little shop that she thrived on making Chocolate and has hopes of continuing in Ecuador and introducing them to chocolate.The characters were interesting and well developed. The story kept my attention and I would recommend it!!",
