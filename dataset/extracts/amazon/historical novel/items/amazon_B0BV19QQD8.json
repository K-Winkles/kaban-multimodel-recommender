        "description": "A stunning new espionage novel by a master of the genre, Beirut Station follows a young female CIA officer whose mission to assassinate a high-level, Hezbollah terrorist reveals a dark truth that puts her life at risk.Lebanon, 2006. The Israel-Hezbollah war is tearing Beirut apart: bombs are raining down, residents are scrambling to evacuate, and the country is on the brink of chaos. In the midst of this turmoil, the CIA and Mossad are targeting a reclusive Hezbollah terrorist, Najib Qassem. Najib is believed to be planning the assassination of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is coming to Beirut in ten days to broker a cease-fire. The spy agencies are running out of time to eliminate the threat. They turn to a young Lebanese-American CIA agent. Analise comes up with the perfect plan: she has befriended Qassem's grandson as his English tutor, and will use this friendship to locate the terrorist and take him out. As the plan is put into action, though, Analise begins to suspect that Mossad has a motive of its own: exploiting the war\u2019s chaos to eliminate a generation of Lebanese political leaders. She alerts the agency but their response is for her to drop it. Annalise is now the target and there is no one she can trust: not the CIA, not Mossad, and not the Lebanese government. And the one person she might have to trust\u2014a reporter for the New York Times\u2014might not be who he says he is\u2026 A tightly-wound international thriller, Beirut Station is Paul Vidich's best novel to date.",

                "reviewText": "With his newest novel, \u201cBeirut Station,\u201d author Paul Vidich has given us a cerebral, moody, absorbing tale of espionage laced with action and suspense. It\u2019s a story more reminiscent of John le Carr\u00e9 than Ian Fleming or Robert Ludlum. There are no heroes, only spies and assassins.The time is 2006. The place is Beirut, Lebanon. Analise Assad, a young, intelligent, and attractive Lebanese-American Georgetown graduate, has recently joined the CIA. Now, she is part of an American-Israeli team charged with taking out Hezbollah terrorist Najib Qassem before he can assassinate US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her upcoming visit. To be successful, Analise will have to exploit a number of people, including several possible love interests, as well as two teens depending on her to help them escape their war-torn country.Mr. Vidich seems to have done a ton of research to give us a very realistic story. He writes knowingly and with nuance about Lebanese history and politics, the city of Beirut, Israeli and American foreign policy objectives, espionage and terrorist tradecraft, what it means to be an intelligence officer (at both the senior and junior levels), and the emotional toll the profession can exact. His main characters have depth and complexity and are compelling. He\u2019s successful at showing us the sights, sounds, and smells of a 2006 Beirut under assault and the city during earlier, more peaceful times.I did have some trouble getting into the story. If, like me, you\u2019re not all that familiar with (or have forgotten) what was going on in Lebanon during the latter part of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, you might feel somewhat lost. (However, a quick trip to Wikipedia\u2019s Lebanon article solved the problem for me.) Mr. Vidich also doesn\u2019t hesitate to interrupt his story\u2019s progress to explain what his characters are thinking and feeling. While those digressions do add immensely to the novel, giving it something of a literary quality, they do take some getting used to.Those who are fans of fiction and non-fiction tales about espionage should find much to enjoy in \"Beirut Station.\"",

                "reviewText": "Analise (terrible name for a character) is a sympathetic protagonist but there are a lot of problems with the plotting of this novel which results in lack of plausibility in the characters and the story- few (serious) agencies still use mainstream media or UN organizations to place their non official cover officers. Not even in 2006. Analise seems to spend more time hanging out with her journalist contacts than doing any real UN work that would be part of her NOC identity- none of the characters ever cohere into fully rounded individuals- the author does not know Lebanon and it shows. McCloskey did a better job evoking St. Petersburg from a distance in the quite good \u201cMoscow X\u201d- the assignment to assassinate Qassem doesn\u2019t make much sense as a plot driver. Killing a top leader wouldn\u2019t deter or disrupt Hezbollah one inch (remember Mugniyeh, see the excellent \u201cRise and Kill First\u201d)- the Israeli campaign against Lebanese politicians would have been a more interesting (and just as believable) plot device, but it doesn\u2019t add much to the story in this book- the writing, suspense, plot twists, technical / specialist knowledge are all medium grade qualitybottom line: ok for a long flight or rainy afternoon",

I think the author errored in using character names that are so obviously drawn from actual historical events in US espionage (Aldrich) and constant references to Philby were overdone. The story would have been better if he had left that out. Otherwise, I look forward to the next installment!",

His novel is set in Beirut and involves the psychological and moral choices made by a deep-cover CIA NOC, in a world where nobody can be trusted - not her fellow CIA officers, her Lebanese colleagues, or her Mossad counterparts. Because of its setting and plot, the novel has a natural tension which draws the reader along, to a gripping conclusion, with plenty of betrayal to go around. A fine effort by Vidich - 5 stars!",
