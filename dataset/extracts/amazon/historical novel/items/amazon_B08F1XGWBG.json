I loved the juxtaposition of the couple from the 1940\u2019s war torn Europe and the couple in the present time with the connection to the past. I have questions that were not answered, and, I guess now leave those to the reader to speculate. How one views the ending for both couples determines the reader\u2019s attitude like the determining of what happened in the ending of the short story, \u201cThe Lady or the Tiger.\u201dHowever, that aside, I was impressed how Hudson described the landing at Normandy, the psychological trauma faced by soldiers, the difficulty of enough food and supplies. I truly enjoyed the novel and discussions offered by the characters. War is hell and humanity has suffered for centuries by those who seek power over us.",

She was a strong woman to go and draw the terrors of war. Describing the worst of life at war while trying to do the right thing for the man she loves. This little clock ,not working player a good spot in the book too. It draws the characters together. I admire her strength of character to live on not knowing how it all would end but prYing it would all work out.That apocalypse well. I enjoyed the book look for more books from you Thank you Sandy",

                "reviewText": "The story takes place in different decades. The first is set in the year 1944 - and also in this day and age. We are introduced to the four principal characters who are taking the train to Cornwall.I must admit though, that for me personally it was not useful to know right from the beginning how the book would end! Maybe it was for that reason that I was not too happy with the story until the middle. After that my heart went out for the two main characters Alex and Eliza. I believe sincerely that the journey into our time with 'Joe and Ellie' did distract from the fascinating love story between War journalist 'Alexander Levine' and 'Lady Arbuthnot' painter.I would have preferred to read about their lives before they met on that faithful train journey. And maybe then a sequel with the other two characters 'Ellie and Joe'. It was the first time I read a book from this author - but it will not be the last time.",

                "reviewText": "I very rarely write a review as books don\u2019t generally stir up emotions that compel me to do so. However, I am in total awe of Melanie Hudson\u2019s writing talent. I never thought she could maintain the momentum she has for taking a reader through every conceivable human emotion as she did in \u201cDear Rosie Hughes\u201d or \u201cLast letter from Juliette\u201d but how wrong I was. With \u201cThe Night Train to Berlin\u201d Hudson has once again delivered. Her characters have such depth and the storyline is so cleaver and believable that it is extremely difficult to put down once one has started. The historical framework on which the book is weaved is very well researched and makes one appreciate in much greater depth the hardships and sacrifices that had to be constantly faced during the years of WW2. Hudson\u2019s books have an quality that very very few books deliver and one of those qualities is one feels a real sense of loss when the book finishes, a kin to coming to the end of a fabulous summer holiday. But more than this, her books never fail to evoke thoughts of parities in ones own life story. \u201cThe Night Train to Berlin\u201d will stay in my mind for a very long time (in a very very good way). If already a Hudson fan, this book will not disappoint. If you have not read a book by this author then you really must take the plunge as you are seriously missing out.",
