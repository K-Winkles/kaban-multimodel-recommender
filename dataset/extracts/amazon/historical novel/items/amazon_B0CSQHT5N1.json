Aiden has an unflattering name in the ton because of a tragedy that occupied when he was young, defining his hermit existence. The story is the second in a series of three sisters and how their found their true love. I enjoyed the story, but the the middle section could have been shortened. The only drama in this story is the emotional upheavals and growth occurring between primary characters. I really enjoyed the witty retorts shared by all characters. The areas that were somewhat confusing to me was that there wasn\u2019t any more in-depth information or closure on Aiden\u2019s \u201ccurse\u201d, and there were several typos throughout the story. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoyed this book. I laughed and I cried. I could really relate to the characters. It was a very interesting premise I have not encountered before in a romance. I liked the independent, strong willed heroine. The hero was interesting as it took a little while to warm up to him. At times he seemed extremely juvenile and frustrating, but those are typical traits for a man! Eventually he wises up and embraces the truth he's been trying to ignore. I understand that the idea of a curse was necessary to move the story along, but it would have been nice for the conclusion if that idea had gotten dispelled.",

                "reviewText": "I had a very difficult time trying to come up with a rating for this book because my feelings about it changed so dramatically while I was reading it. For the first 220 pages, I found it so boring that I struggled to keep reading and even let the book sit for a couple of days because I didn\u2019t have much interest in reading it. I found too much of it to be unnecessarily wordy and it dragged on.However, after page 220, that completely changed. I found myself staying up to finish it and was literally laughing out loud and crying (at different times). I especially appreciated the dialogue which suddenly had a witty humor that I enjoyed immensely and had me feeling a lot more positive about the book.That would have resulted in a higher rating except for some other issues. The story never resolved the cursed theme of the book which became obsessive and made no sense. Considering a duke\u2019s power and influence, who would talk like that to a duke and why did he or his godmother allow it?? I also found that for a while I didn\u2019t like the character of Prudence as much because her efforts to resolve it were \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201dI also found typos to be irritating, but the biggest negative for me is the latest trend of adding preview chapters that aren\u2019t included in the same file but require the reader to go to another site to claim them. My distaste for the manipulative way that readers are forced to give their email information in order to access the preview chapter and extended epilogue can\u2019t be overstated. It used to be that to read the extended epilogues you had to click and give your contact information (also requiring internet access and signal), but now authors are also adding introductory chapters that also require the same thing. It makes me angry that they manipulate readers like that, rather than just including the prequel chapters and extended epilogues as part of the book which they are.",

They meet at a garden party when she trespasses into the house. He sees her as a way to still his godmother\u2019s pressure to marry as they agree to a fake courtship. I felt at times that the heroine carried her teasing a bit too far, as she was very considerate of others normally. The storyline was good with it taking them both some time to realize that their feelings were changing. I enjoyed this second book of the series and look forward to the other sister\u2019s book.",

Prudence is portrayed as a strong and loyal person while Aiden is sweet and hiding from life. This book kept me reading until the end. Highly recommend.",
