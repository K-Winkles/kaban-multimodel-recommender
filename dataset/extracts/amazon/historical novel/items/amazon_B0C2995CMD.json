                "reviewText": "Any Duke in a Storm by Amalie HowardDaring Dukes series #4. Historical romance, own voices. Can be read as a stand-alone.Famed spy, Lady Lisbeth Medford is in disguise as a notorious pirate captain, Bonnie Bess. Her mission is to capture the Prince of Smugglers. After quickly leaving Tobago in the British West Indies, she finds her quartermaster has hired a new sailing master. And he\u2019s entirely too confident.Raphael Saint, the Duc de Viel, has plenty of sailing experience but it\u2019s usually as Captain of his own ships. Family treachery has Saint escaping prison and boarding the first ship leaving Tobago to try find proof of his uncle\u2019s lies. Finding a female captain that can shoot and fight with precision and skill isn\u2019t necessarily a surprise as her reputation has to have some truth behind it. It\u2019s the passion and caring he sees behind the mask that has him intrigued and more than a little enamored.Bess and Saint find a common goal and it\u2019s drawing them together as neither expected.Excerpts I had to highlight:Captain, smuggler, spy or temptress?\u201cUnlike Bonnie Bess who was made of blades and thorns, Lisbeth seemed to be made of melody and moonlight.\u201dDuke, pirate or hero?\u201cHonestly, why don\u2019t all the novels say that being a hero is exhausting? Being a villain is so much easier. No damsel, no demands, no precious virtue to be ruined, no waking up at ungodly hours, and being plied within incessant questions.\u201dAbsorbing and intricate storytelling. This story will leave you breathless. Between the danger on the seas, the pirates, the family betrayals, the heroes trying to do better, and the undeniable passions, it\u2019s a wild ride of adventure.Be sure to read the Author Notes at the end of the book. The research and details are impressive and tell the background of many of the characters and how they apply in the story and in real life. I also love the intelligence within the writing. I highlighted a half a dozen words such as \u201cjocund\u201d that were new to me.",

                "reviewText": "Any Duke in a Storm is the fourth book in the Daring Dukes series. I've only read two of the four and felt like it could easily be read as a standalone. The couple from book three do make a few appearances but I wasn't missing anything having never read their book.Bonnie Bess may be a cutthroat smuggler but underneath it all Lady Lisbeth is just trying to juggle the many her many personas. As a spy for the crown, she has been tasked with helping to catch the infamous Prince of Smugglers by infiltrating their smuggling ring. She doesn't expect to take on a mysterious new sailing master who it turns out is the Prince of Smugglers notorious nephew. They both have plenty of secrets and it's becoming increasingly difficult to separate their mission and feelings.This is a swashbuckling romp all around the Caribbean and Eastern US. There was plenty of pirate speak, sword fights, and spice. I loved how naturally flirtatious Saint was. He was charming, funny, snarky and sarcastic but never at Lisbeth's expense. Lisbeth was a fun heroine. Since she's the captain of the ship, she is used to be the dominant one in a relationship and it was nice seeing her have moments of letting her guard down with Saint. Although I really enjoyed it, the first half did feel a bit tedious. About halfway in, the plot hit it's stride. I think the details in setting up the plotline was what make the first half go on forever. Ultimately, the romance and chemistry made the book. It had great spice that I can see myself rereading I enjoy Amalie Howard's book and will definitely think about going back and reading the two books in the series I missed. I think it's important to read the author's notes in the end. It made me aware of how much research Howard put into the book and appreciate some of the choices she made more.Tropes included: romance on the sea, pirates/smugglers, found family, secrets and spies, diverse hero, strong heroine, pansexual heroine, divorced heroine, hero falls first, \"good girl,\" forced proximity, nicknames, tattooed and pierced hero, swordfight foreplayI read an eARC. All opinions expressed are my own. #netgalley #amaliehoward #AnyDukeinaStorm #DaringDukes",
