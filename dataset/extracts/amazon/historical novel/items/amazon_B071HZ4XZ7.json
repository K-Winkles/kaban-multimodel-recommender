                "reviewText": "This is my first Davalynn Spencer book and I loved it. I was initially drawn to the cover and it's intriguing title. I read the sample chapters and found I wanted to know what was going to happen between Cade and Mae Ann. Mae Ann's a mail order bride who never makes it to the altar and offers herself to Cade as a wife. One who will cook, clean, garden and do his laundry. Cade agrees, but isn't really sure why he does, he's sworn off women after the last one broke his heart. They are married, but in name only. Yet there is an attraction there and I really enjoyed watching it play out. Deacon was a terrific secondary character that really had me laughing. I loved his cowboy rendition of Psalm 23, I smile every time I think about it:\"The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.He beds me down in green pastures with sweet water.He leads me on a good trail and stays with me in the tight places.And the Lord's spread will be my home forever. Amen.\"This is a wonderful, witty, western love story full of charm and appeal. It's book one in the Front Range Brides series, I'll be on the lookout for book two and hope I get a glimpse of Cade and Mae Ann down the road. I also happened to notice more of Spencer's wit at work in her publishing company's name, storyDspencer, very clever Davalynn!",

                "reviewText": "This author is new to me, but after having read this book, I'm about to make it my mission to track down and read every book she's ever written! This is a story about a young woman alone in the world who sets out to marry someone she's only corresponded with. When she arrives, instead of going directly to the church where the pastor was waiting, her fiance asks that they stop at the bank to complete an errand first. While there, the bank is robbed and her fiance is shot and killed. In the aftermath, a kind rancher, who was also in the bank when it was robbed, helps arrange to get her fiance's body to the undertaker and then asks her if there was anything else he could do to help her. Still very much in shock and unsure of what was to become of her now, she looks up at the rancher and asks him, \"You wouldn't happen to need a wife, would you?\". And that's when her adventure really starts. Mae Ann and Cade begin their life together with the usual misunderstandings as any new couple, but with the added burden of being strangers, not knowing what to expect or what was expected. Heart rending with glimpses of the humorous moments encountered in blossoming relationships, this book truly touched my heart. My only regret was that it ended too soon!",

                "reviewText": "An Improper Proposal, just the title alone grasps your attention, so I had to read the book. It is my first read of a Davalynn Spencer book but it will not be my last. I was captivated from the start to the finish. It is set in the late 1800's in Colorado and features a cowboy/rancher. Not much else needs to be said in my opinion. However, I will continue. Mae Ann Remington is a mail order bride who finds herself without a husband when she gets to Colorado. In desperation, she turns to a complete stranger, Cade Parker, and asks him to marry her. He is flustered at first and doesn't want to marry her (he had been hurt before) but he is a gentleman who feels something for her, so he agrees. They are married in name only, and head off to his ranch. He has a ranch hand named Deacon, who is a wonderful side character, you will love him. She starts cooking, cleaning, gardening, learns to ride and shoot and along the way, with criminals involved and shady things going on, Mae Ann and Cade fall in love. But it is so subtle and endearing, you will love it. I also love the Christian aspect of the book which is part of the characters and is very well done. Ms. Spencer has a new fan for life!",
