                "reviewText": "The story is the first in the new series, Mail-Order Brides on the Run which are clean historical western stories. The story begins in Atlanta, Georgia after the Civil War has ended. So many young women are left to fend for themselves, losing their families and all their possessions. A small group of women have banded together, staying together in a boarding house, and working jobs to survive. But what happens when one is faced with a lecherous old man who claims he has the right to her in marriage? Annabelle Lane\u2019s friends come up with a plan to help her escape and go westward as a mail-order bride to a small town with only about fifty inhabitants.\u201cIt\u2019s as if my life has been reduced to choosing between the frying pan or the fire.\u201dThe Ford family runs a large ranch and uses range rovers to keep up with the longhorn cattle. The only female is Paloma Ford, a widowed mother to grown men. A plan has been devised to send off for mail-order brides, starting with one. The first groom will be widower, Ethan Vasquez.The story\u2019s plot will have Annabelle shocked by the actions of Mr. Dale Allard Featherfall, who now owns the plantation owned by her family. After the death of her father, the bank foreclosed on the property. But now Mr. Featherfall is looking for his fourth wife and has informed Annabelle that it will be her to pay family debts owed to him. With the help of her friends, she will be matched up and shipped out the very next day as a mail-order bride heading to Texas. But trouble follows all along the way. Ethan is now responsible for his new bride and her well-being and to try and discover why someone is after her. There doesn\u2019t seem to be an end to the length they will go to find her either.The story has mystery, suspense, danger, and eventually a clean romance. I like Ethan and Annabelle together\u2014but this union isn\u2019t without issues and secrets. The story is a fascinating page-turning tale that has a great cast of characters and some surprises. I\u2019m looking forward to more books in this series and to seeing what happens to Annabelle\u2019s friends back in Atlanta. Will they too come to the same area to marry?\u201cThe best is yet to come.\u201d",

                "reviewText": "This is a well-thought-out plot and execution; my only complaint was some cheesy dialogue in the middle of the story. This book does an excellent job of explaining just how difficult it was to live after the Civil War. The place is Atlanta, Georgia and a group of women have banded together to share their pennies and humble apartment. Life is very hard.However, it gets harder when Annabelle, one of the young women, takes some washing to her former home, where a carpetbagger lives. He wants to marry Annabelle but demands she marry him to defray the expenses he paid to defray the medicines her mother needed before her death. Annabelle doubts his assertion but has no way to disprove it. It would be her word against a wealthy man.Since Annabelle is in dire circumstances, she becomes a mail-order bride in Texas. It is a sparsely inhabited region, and the Ford men who own the ranch want to get families started to create a town. To that end, they hire a mail-order firm to send a first bride to try it out. The first groom is Ethan Vasquez, a widower.This is the story of how Anabelle (with no farm experience) learns to create a life with her husband. The shadow of the lecherous old man who wanted to marry her in Atlanta follows her to Texas. This makes for an exciting story.",
