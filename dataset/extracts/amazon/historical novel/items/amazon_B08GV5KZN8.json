        "description": "\u201cMark Sullivan has done it again! The Last Green Valley is a compelling and inspiring story of heroism and courage in the dark days at the end of World War II.\u201d --Kristin Hannah, number one New York Times best-selling authorFrom the author of the number one best seller Beneath a Scarlet Sky comes a new historical novel inspired by one family\u2019s incredible story of daring, survival, and triumph.In late March 1944, as Stalin\u2019s forces push into Ukraine, young Emil and Adeline Martel must make a terrible decision: Do they wait for the Soviet bear\u2019s intrusion and risk being sent to Siberia? Or do they reluctantly follow the wolves - murderous Nazi officers who have pledged to protect \u201cpure-blood\u201d Germans?The Martels are one of many families of German heritage whose ancestors have farmed in Ukraine for more than a century. But after already living under Stalin\u2019s horrifying regime, Emil and Adeline decide they must run in retreat from their land with the wolves they despise to escape the Soviets and go in search of freedom.Caught between two warring forces and overcoming horrific trials to pursue their hope of immigrating to the West, the Martels\u2019 story is a brutal, complex, and ultimately triumphant tale that illuminates the extraordinary power of love, faith, and one family\u2019s incredible will to survive and see their dreams realized.
