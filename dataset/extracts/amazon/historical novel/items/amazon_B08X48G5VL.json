For generations her family has kept an exclusive bridal salon in Paris, where magic is worked with needle and thread. It\u2019s said that the bride who wears a Roussel gown is guaranteed a lifetime of joy. But devastating losses during World War II leave Soline\u2019s world and heart in ruins and her faith in love shaken. She boxes up her memories, stowing them away, along with her broken dreams, determined to forget.Decades later, while coping with her own tragic loss, aspiring gallery owner Rory Grant leases Soline\u2019s old property and discovers a box containing letters and a vintage wedding dress, never worn. When Rory returns the mementos, an unlikely friendship develops, and eerie parallels in Rory\u2019s and Soline\u2019s lives begin to surface. It\u2019s clear that they were destined to meet\u2014and that Rory may hold the key to righting a forty-year wrong and opening the door to shared healing and, perhaps, a little magic.",

                "reviewText": "This book broke my heart and made me cry multiple times \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d but I'm so glad there is a happy ending. Well, I hope I'm not ruining that for anyone. I mean it's in the title. Of course there is a happy ending, but before getting there, your heart will break so many times while reading this masterpiece. I absolutely loved this beautiful book. I don't even know how to describe it. Barbara Davis is a master storyteller and this is truly a masterpiece. There are two parallel storylines. In the past (during WWII), two young lovers separated by war and kept apart because of a cruel father's lies. Then in the present timeline (which is the 80s), a young woman is navigating life as a gallery owner who's suddenly lost in touch with her fiancee, who is doctor in a warzone, for several months. The two stories are woven together beautifully and when you finally see how the two are connected, it all makes sense. It's a lesson in dealing with past hurts, lies, and wounds, forgiveness, and acceptance. It's a story about love and not just between lovers, but between mothers and daughters, grandparents, brothers and sisters. All kinds of love are explored in this story.It was a bit of a slow start, but the second half of the book picked up and you are pulled into the scene and feel all the emotions. I love the quotes by the dress witch at the beginning of Soline's chapters. They are all little nuggets of wisdom about love, life and perspective. I found myself highlighting some of them and rereading them again and again. I think I need to reread this book again to truly appreciate the details of the story. I missed a lot of things in the middle, especially when I was listening to some of it on audiobook. The voice of Soline has a heavy French accent so it's sometimes difficult to hear what she's saying clearly. But I like that they used the French accent to make the character come to life.I thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely be checking out more of Barbara Davis's books. This is the second book I've read by her now and I've become a huge fan.",
