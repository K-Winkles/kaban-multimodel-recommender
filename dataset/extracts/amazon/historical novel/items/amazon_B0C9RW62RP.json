        "description": "England, 1942. \u201cIt has to stay secret,\u201d he whispers, placing the locket around her neck. \u201cIf they find it, they\u2019ll send me away.\u201d As she holds the locket, glinting in the moonlight, she can\u2019t hold back the tears. \u201cI just wish we didn\u2019t have to hide\u2026\u201d When farmer\u2019s daughter Irene meets Theodore at a village dance, sparks fly instantly. The war has brought him all the way from Louisiana to build a US airbase just across her father\u2019s fields, but as they sway together, there is nothing else in the world. Only his gentle touch and his deep brown eyes. But being together comes at a price. As Theodore is Black, the might of the US Air Force is against them, and all the members of the little village community disapprove of their relationship. And they will all go to terrible lengths to tear the two young lovers apart\u2026 Decades later, heartbroken Ruby is back at her family\u2019s crumbling farmhouse for the first time in years, after the loss of her beloved grandmother Irene. The roof has fallen in, family photographs are damaged \u2013 and her grandmother\u2019s jewellery is nowhere to be found. When Ruby uncovers her grandmother\u2019s waterlogged diaries, she discovers that Irene treasured one piece of lost jewellery above all. A locket from a man called Theodore. And the missing locket holds the key to unravelling a heartbreaking secret that changed her grandmother\u2019s life\u2026 Is someone in the village hiding the locket to keep the truth about Irene and Theodore buried? And can Ruby find a way to honour her grandmother\u2019s memory \u00ad\u2013 or in digging up the pain of the war, will she tear her family apart? An absolutely breathtaking World War Two story about the power of love in the face of adversity, and how the tragic consequences of war can echo through generations. Fans of Fiona Valpy, The Nightingale and All the Light We Cannot See will be addicted to this incredible read.

As she seeks to recover her grandmother's locket, Ruby unearth's secrets that have torn her family apart.Told from the alternating viewpoints of Irene(1940's) and her granddaughter in the present day, readers will slowly see strong themes emerging, connected between the two stories. While at times Irene displayed great strength of character, other times, she seemed beaten down. But that only made her story seem all the more realistic. Ruby was my favorite. I loved her tenacity as she continued to seek answers, discovering truths that have the power to heal.Content warning-probably not suitable for young readers. Acts of violence and rape.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author/publsiher and was not required to write a review. All opinions expressed are my own.",

Irene is a farm girl from England who falls in love with Theodore, a Black American soldier. The cards are stacked against them and this story is a series of what ifs and what could have been.I like the dual timeline with Irene in 1943 and Ruby, Irene\u2019s granddaughter in the present. I won't give away the ending but it tied up the story nicely. Many thanks to the author, Bookouture and NetGalley for a complimentary copy of the book.

                "reviewText": "My heart about broke reading such an emotional story.A time slip taking place in England 1942 and modern times. Each features a romantic couple, the one in 1942 is Irene, a 17-year-old farmer\u2019s daughter, Irene, and Theo a service man stationed far from Louisiana, now proudly serving in the US Air Force and there to build a US airbase just across her father\u2019s fields.The modern times story features Irene\u2019s granddaughter Ruby and her romantic partner. I will admit my favorite part of the story was the historical time period.Irene falls fast when she meets Theo at a town dance, but Theo warns her they must keep their romance a secret, see Theo is black and a romance such as this is just not accepted in this time period.The descriptions of the prejudice people and the treatment of Theo including beatings just for a romance with a white woman disgusted me. What business is it of anyone who someone dates or socializes with, nobody\u2019s affair but the two it involves. And this includes the church minister involved in bigotry.There was just no combatting prejudice and bigotry at this time and Theo was beaten, sent away and jailed. Before this though, when their romance was fresh and new, they were engaged, and he gave her a beautiful engagement ring hidden in a locket. My heart breaks for the injustice and ruined lives here.Many years later Irene\u2019s granddaughter, Ruby comes to the farm where Irene lived and finds her grandmother\u2019s diary.She is determined to find out her grandmother\u2019s secrets, she had no idea about her grandmother\u2019s past or where the locket is located. Will digging up the past cause pain to her family, especially and older generation member or will they hold the key to unlocking the past?Brilliantly written, I had such a hard time putting this down. The perseverance the past generation showed in the face of adversity is amazing and must be commended! Five stars but I wish I could give it more!I was given a complimentary copy of this book. All opinions expressed are my own.",

                "reviewText": "I often have a sense of trepidation when a writer I admire does something new. I want more of the things I love. Will a new approach be as good as the stories that I trust and enjoy? I have read all of Natalie Meg Evans historical novels, each brilliantly setaround the time of the Second World War. I love the twisting plots, the historical authenticity and insights. And here is her new book set in two periods - in rural Suffolk, at the time of the arrival of American GIs, and today, in the same place, post COVID, post lockdown, still bruised. Two strong women, and cultural norms that have shifted for the better, yet with the legacy of damaged pasts still unhealed..It's a rich mix. I loved Natalies\u2019s observations of the present as much as I have loved her observations of the past - she expertly uses small details to conjure a whole world. I enjoy the lightness with which she wears her knowledge. The recipe for wartime marzipan (mashed beans. Almond flavouring, with just a sprinkling of the real nuts) which tells us, without a lecture, of the hard work and privations of wartime; the blacked-out dancehall sweat, so that we can almost smell the life force and energy of young people, living as hard as they can, yet many destined to die, the minutiae that affect our broadband connections, and therefore our ability to work effectively at an international level.The dual time narratives work well, illuminating cultural changes, whist showing how our present is affected by our past, and holding up the possibility of recovery and (partial) redemption. It is gripping, from a great storyteller, and ultimately hopeful. I read the whole book on the day it came out, and was left with a sense of gratitude, that in some ways at least, our world is better than it was. Enjoy.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really interesting, engaging novel with two interconnecting timelines, one set in the second world war, and the other, contemporary. It is essentially a quest novel, with hard secrets being unearthed along the way as Ruby delves into her grandmother's traumatic wartime past. The two love stories are engaging and well drawn, and make a poignant heart to the novel. Natalie Meg Evans handles the racial issues at the centre of the book with sensitivity. I found it a thought provoking and compelling read. Highly recommended.",
