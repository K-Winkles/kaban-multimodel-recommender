Emilie runs from the disgrace of her father, a forger of art. She wants her own life. She gets on a ship headed for New York City and spends her time in the cabin learning about stained glass. She wants to work for Tiffany\u2019s Glass Company.She gets the job, and shares a room at the boarding house of other Tiffany women workers. This is a really good story that not only tells the story of Louis Comfort Tiffany but also of those that worked for him with a view of how the industry works. It also gives a view of the times and trials of women and the poor people and those that do the news reporting. Excellent!",

The descriptions of New York and Paris at the turn of the century included social, political and artistic narratives which flowed the tale along.

As a stained glass artist, I liked some of the material but really wanted to love this book and it just left me feeling like the drama, drama, drama was for nothing.",
