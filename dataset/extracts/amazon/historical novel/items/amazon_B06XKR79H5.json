                "reviewText": "This book actually got a bit better at labeling the characters that were speaking. It still suffers from the problem of not always knowing who's talking, but not as much as the others in the series. The story is well written and interesting. You can tell that the story is gearing up for the final arc while simultaneously winding down for the end. It's tying up loose ends while setting up for the final scene which needs to be solved. Even if some characters were brought in simply to progress the story, they were given enough backstory to care about them and we're done in a way to make sense even if they were a simple throw away, plot device character. Lastly, the original character's personalities are developing quite nicely. Each one is growing noticably. Even if, in Holo's case, it's much more slowly. Overall I enjoyed the story quite thoroughly.",

                "reviewText": "Great addition to the series! Not as long as the other volumes, but it matters very little for this story. It picks up right where volume 10 left off. The story has great pacing and the dialogue between the companions is exceptional as always. There truly wasn't a moment that I wasn't enamored by the dialogue between Holo and Lawrence. And which I'm happy to say the book was absolutely flooded with their banter to the point where I think that a permanent grin has made its home on my face. I'm going to have to re-read a few more times to be sure I didn't miss out on any clues or hidden meanings, because the author sure seems to like to do that kind of thing. Like the rest of the series, an absolute must read.",

                "reviewText": "Once again the author has pulled in some different ideas here. It seemed a little more focused on the relationship with the church this time rather than economics, and I felt that there was a little too much character development for two throwaway characters. But if you got this far in the series, you know it's more about a clever situation and some interesting dialogue than action. This is not the best in the series, but it doesn't drop the ball too far.",
