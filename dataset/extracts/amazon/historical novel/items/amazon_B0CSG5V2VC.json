                "reviewText": "I could not put this book down and read it over 2 days. Having previously read of the truly horrific stories of those who were sadly held as prisoners in the camps, this book gives you a comprehensive understanding of what daily living experiences was like from when the German army rolled into Amsterdam. From living an ordinary family life to being transported like cattle to the camps. The storyline of the five family members is gripping, detailing how the Jewish community were slowly segregated. From having to wear stars on their clothing and unable to attend a cinema to being beaten in the street or homes raided in the middle of the night for being Jewish are just a few examples. This book also gives an accurate narrative of the Nazi invasion and how the regime was rolled out with violence and manipulation by army officials. The story of the Kisch family is heart-wrenching with the educational information that is threaded through the book is invaluable.This is a book that everyone should read as it gives an account of the impact that the war had on the Jewish community. It leaves you feeling very humbled hearing the stories of those trying to survive whilst remembering those who lost their lives.",

                "reviewText": "A stunningly good first novel, based on Mark DeMeza\u2019s shocking recent discovery of what happened to his family in wartime Amsterdam and their transportation to the Nazi death camps. The author skilfully interweaves a harrowing account of the fates of the fictional Kisch family with the historical events, places and main characters of the era (a compelling mix of the best and worst of humanity). As such, I found his novel both enthralling and highly educational. The narrative is also very well written, with numerous chapters that flow beautifully from Mark\u2019s pen, whilst leaving the reader with a sense of foreboding about what is to follow or in deep shock at the dramatic and tragic events that unfold. Bravo to Mark - I very much look forward to the sequel.",
