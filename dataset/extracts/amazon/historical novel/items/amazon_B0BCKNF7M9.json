                "reviewText": "Judy Washington lived in the Bronx in 1944, with her mother after her husband Herbert had joined the Army right after the Pearl Harbor attack. At first he sent money to help support the household but in the past year Judy had not heard from him. She understood there was delays in the mail but she had been hoping for something for so long. This meant she had to work harder to make ends meet. The Slave Market wasn\u2019t the best place but it was something, both Judy and her mother would go there daily to be picked up by white women who wanted things done in their household for pennies. When she was given the chance Judy took it and joined the Women\u2019s Army Corps (WAC). But she was not expecting how tough it would be to be in the Army, the drills, the inspections were all over whelming but she knew she had to overcome it all because if she failed she would be sent home. Would the friends she was making, Stacy from a farm in Missouri, Bernadette a beauty from Chicago and finally Mary Alyce Dixon from Vermont (who had a story of her own!), help her succeed and then go on to become a stronger woman?Mary Alyce had grown up in a small town in Vermont and knew she needed to escape at sometime. So she decided she needed to join the WACs. She was grateful that her two best friends from the town were coming with her and they knew together they would have adventures. What she didn\u2019t expect was part way through the training in Iowa that the fact her mother never told her about her father would cause her problems\u2026.he was colored. So that meant she was colored too, she would not be going to Northern Africa but instead quickly transferred to Company B. It was a hard adjustment for her as someone who had grown up in the white world and not know what it was like to be a different race. Now the question would be could she handle it all and overcome it all, making new friends and start a new life? Or would she go back to Vermont where the gossip was already starting about her and who knows what she would face there? When it was all over would she go to Alabama where her father was from?Charity Edna Adams character is based on a true person, she became the highest ranking black woman in the US military, she was a Lt Colonel by the end of the war in 1945. She joined the WAC in 1942 and was stationed in Ft Des Moines, Iowa. She had spent years overseeing the training personnel and all she wanted to do was go overseas to make a difference, especially after hearing about D-Day and the major shifts in Europe for fighting. Finally she was given a chance to put together a Battalion of over 800 black women and head to out in late 1944, where there was a major problem. Organize and send out millions of letters and packages that had been collecting in a location in Birmingham, England. Now the question was would this group of ladies be able to do the task?While this is a fiction book, part of it is based on facts (there were some errors for example there isn\u2019t a thing called Second Officer, she was a Captain while in Iowa, farther on it has her as a Major and then two sentences later called Lieutenant). While the civil war might have been over for 70 plus years segregation was still very predominate in so many areas, especially in the military in the 30s and 40s. Black women had to fight hard in order to be allowed to serve and then to prove beyond any reasonable doubt they were very capable of doing the job that was assigned to them. When the 6888th (known as the 6-Triple 8) Central Post Battalion was formed it became a huge part of leading the troops onto success in Europe\u2026.by making sure they finally got their mail. Mail at those times was such a morale booster to all, even the shortest and simplest message had so much meaning. It showed the troops that they were loved and it showed the families and friends at home they were alive. That actually did become their motto \u201cNo Mail, Low Morale\u201d. This is one of several books about this group of amazing women who overcame so many odds to show that they were possible of doing anything. I am glad they are finally being recognized, something that should have happened a long time ago",

                "reviewText": "I am glad that more historical fiction is being written about women who served in the Women\u2019s Army Corps, especially women of color, during World War Two. These stories need to be told and the more we know the stronger we become. However, as a former member of the Women\u2019s Army Corps I cringed every time the privates were referred to as officers. They were enlisted women and as such would never have been called officers; Major Adams and Captain Campbell would have been referred to as officers.In the book, \u201cNo mail, no morale\u201d was shown several times as being the motto of the 6888th. Since this didn\u2019t seem to make sense I researched and found that the actual motto of the Six Triple Eight was \u201cNo mail, low morale\u201d.Lastly, 19,246 American soldiers were killed at The Battle of the Bulge not 100,000.These were the main inaccuracies that I found distracting and wonder why the editing wasn\u2019t better.",

These women fought with hardship after hardship, and racism but they all came out on top. Kudos to them! Why isn\u2019t this taught in our schools? These powerful strong women regardless of race should be celebrated just like any GI was. Please read this book.
