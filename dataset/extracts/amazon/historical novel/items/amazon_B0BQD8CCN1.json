The novel describes the struggles Katja Heinz, the assistant of the treating doctor, to publish the notebook and bring the mental deficiencies and danger of Hitler to public attention.This fast-paced novel kept my attention and interest through to the end. Although there were a lot of coincidences and near misses, and a bit too much romance for my taste, it was well written and will appeal to many readers who will root for Katja to get the notebook to the proper authorities and find happiness at last.I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.",

Imagine her surprise when she uncovers that Dr.Viktor\u2019s delusional patient was Adolf Hitler. Because of this, her work has to be done in the utmost secrecy.The book was a real page turner. Dr. Viktor and Kat ja put their lives at risk to keep this information safe and to make certain that it gets to the right hands. The storyline moves fast at times but there is also attention to detail.The characters are complex and well developed and this made it an enjoyable read.",

While I can\u2019t say it surpassed The Light We Left Behind for me, it was still quite an interesting read.When Katja takes a job at a clinic. Doctor Viktor assigns her the task of typing up secret medical records belonging to Adolf Hitler. She is persuaded by the doctor to take the manuscript to Paris with him. They do so at great risk, having to evade the Nazi spies.I didn\u2019t click with the characters as much as I would have liked to. The plot was interesting and unique, however, I didn\u2019t feel myself hanging onto every word. Still, it was an enjoyable read. I always enjoy finding WWII fiction that can stand out against the typical formulas.A huge thanks to Harper360 for sending me a free (US) ARC of the book! I have also purchased the Kindle edition.",

                "reviewTitle": "A highly original and totally compelling wartime story",
                "reviewText": "There are times when I think I might be growing tired of wartime stories \u2013 and then a book like this one comes along, beautifully written and with such stunning originality, and I wonder what on earth why on earth I ever thought that. A piece of fiction, but built around a kernel of truth, with real events, characters and locations \u2013 the author\u2019s afterword is almost as fascinating as the book itself \u2013 with an added layer of \u201cwhat if\u201d that made it a totally compelling story.In 1939 Hamburg, with the Nazi threat becoming ever more evident, Katja \u2013 struggling with the care of her frail mother, and her own grief over the death of her activist father in the early book burnings \u2013 unexpectedly secures a job as personal assistant to psychiatrist Doctor Viktor. Entrusted with the transcription of a notebook, she slowly realises that the clinical notes she\u2019s working on have an immense importance \u2013 the doctor treated Adolf Hitler following a gas attack in WW1, and they hold major secrets about his mental health that, if shared, could have a considerable value in changing the course of history. She travels with the doctor to Paris, in an attempt to get the notes published \u2013 and, as an avid book lover, finds herself in Shakespeare and Company, where she meets Daniel. He\u2019s a newspaper journalist, struggling with the recent loss of his wife and child, drinking too much \u2013 but, as Katja\u2019s world falls apart, might just offer her the support she needs to achieve her aim of getting the notebook and its important information into allied hands and into the public domain.Katja is a quite wonderful heroine \u2013 young and at first naive, but with a developing steely determination to achieve her objective, showing exceptional bravery in the furtherance of the mission she really believes in. And I entirely believed in her, willing her on at every turn and through every heartbreaking setback. The world the author builds around her is wonderfully researched and recreated, and searingly real \u2013 the well-drawn individuals who stand in her way and work against her, the support she finds when her task seems impossible, the increase of Nazi oppression in Hamburg itself and the approaching threat of invasion when in Paris. The writing is just wonderful \u2013 after a necessarily steady start to introduce the characters and their context, the tension and pace really ramp up together with that feeling of suspense and mounting danger that made the book quite impossible to set aside. There\u2019s a lot of exceptionally well-developed drama, but there\u2019s a relationship story in here too \u2013 an all-consuming love story that had the perfect emotional touch, very real and particularly engaging, between two characters who already held my heart in their hands.This book really was quite exceptional in so many ways \u2013 without question one of my books of the year, with an unforgettable impact, and I recommend it really highly.",

                "reviewTitle": "Stunning WW2 novel set in Germany and France that combines high suspense with a sweeping romance",
                "reviewText": "What if it was spring 1939\u2026 and you knew a secret so damaging it could topple Hitler.German Katja does and the exciting premise of this beautifully written novel is how that secret is the true and very unstable state of the furthers mental (ill) health.Like Tessa\u2019s previous book, \u201cThe Light We Left Behind\u201d this novel takes a true, largely unknown nugget of WW2 history and transforms it into in a captivating, emotionally charged story.Here the \u2019nugget\u2019 is how in 1918, a young Adolf was treated by a psychiatrist following a mustard gas attack. It can be presumed that any mind doctor would have identified a serious mental disorder in this patient. We know the doctor\u2019s name and that he made full notes. But not what had happened to them by the time war broke out.So the \u2018gold\u2019 of this nugget is how might Europe in1939 react if that doctor was able to tell the world what Hitler was really like. Could the war be stopped, even before it started?This is Katja's fervent belief. We meet her as her boss, psychiatrist Dr Viktor tasks her with typing up those notes - the Paris Notebook of the title. Such is her courage that she will go on to risk her life, and the lives of those that she loves as she strives to make public the notes.Whilst the plotting is stunning - especially as it weaves between Berlin and Paris - it is the integrity and believability of the characters that made me gasp. I was by turns scared, excited and consumed with Katja and sad, furious, amused and enthralled by Daniel, an Irish writer she meets in Paris.Other characters are superbly drawn too. Katja\u2019s anxious mother. Daniel\u2019s bohemian friends. You feel what they endure in 1930s Germany; you soak up the innocence in a France yet to fall.The main action takes place over around eight months. I got into the story right from page one and could have read and read on without putting it down. However! As with books that I truly love, I decided to savour this one and split it over several weekends, all the more to soak up the authentic period detail and the joy of reading about characters who do what it right, not what is easy.I adored this book.I gasped. I cried. Finally - I sat back satisfied. I\u2019d been on an exhilarating journey - and it had been very worthwhile.If you enjoy novels with strong characters and plots that you cannot predict, then I am sure that you will love it too. A highly deserved Five Stars",
