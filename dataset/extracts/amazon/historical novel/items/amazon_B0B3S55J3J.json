Oney as they called her was a slave fk the Washington family she escaped when she found out she would be given to their granddaughter who was always so mean to her. The Washington's kept Ona and others enslaved, by moving them from the free state of Philadelphia back to Mount Vernon every six months. This book also introduces Ona's present day family who found her diary. Of you like historical fiction I'd highly recommend this one .",

Suzette Harrison captured Ona\u2019s feelings, worries, lust for freedom, and life as a young innocent girl born into slavery. The description of the Washingtons was enlightening and told from the prospective of a slave. This part of the book was excellent, and I would have liked to have read more of it. The story about Tessa was boring and way too detailed. I felt it detracted from Ona. Could have been much shorter. I skimmed through most of it. Disappointed with this part of the book.",

                "reviewText": "An amazing story of a woman's struggle to maintain her dignity, her family, and her soul.I came across this story accidently and started to read it. I love historical novels and couldn't put it down. Although I assumed there was some small truth in the story it read as if it was 100% real and as far as I'm concerned it was.Suzette, thank you for helping this 71 year old white woman receive a small glimpse into the life as a slave, however difficult it is to be seen and felt!",

'My name is Ona Judge' was definitely a good read, but the characters and their struggles very closely mirrored those in 'Girl at the back of the bus', which for me tainted the read throughout. Read in isolation, I'd probably rate as 5 starts.",
