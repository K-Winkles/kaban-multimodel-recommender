The Fraud is not a change for Smith, but a demonstration of how expansive her talents are.\u201d \u2014Los Angeles TimesFrom acclaimed and bestselling novelist Zadie Smith, a kaleidoscopic work of historical fiction set against the legal trial that divided Victorian England, about who gets to tell their story\u2014and who gets to be believedIt is 1873. Mrs. Eliza Touchet is the Scottish housekeeper\u2014and cousin by marriage\u2014of a once-famous novelist, now in decline, William Ainsworth, with whom she has lived for thirty years.Mrs. Touchet is a woman of many interests: literature, justice, abolitionism, class, her cousin, his wives, this life and the next. But she is also sceptical. She suspects her cousin of having no talent; his successful friend, Mr. Charles Dickens, of being a bully and a moralist; and England of being a land of facades, in which nothing is quite what it seems.Andrew Bogle, meanwhile, grew up enslaved on the Hope Plantation, Jamaica. He knows every lump of sugar comes at a human cost. That the rich deceive the poor. And that people are more easily manipulated than they realize. When Bogle finds himself in London, star witness in a celebrated case of imposture, he knows his future depends on telling the right story.The \u201cTichborne Trial\u201d\u2014wherein a lower-class butcher from Australia claimed he was in fact the rightful heir of a sizable estate and title\u2014captivates Mrs. Touchet and all of England. Is Sir Roger Tichborne really who he says he is? Or is he a fraud? Mrs. Touchet is a woman of the world. Mr. Bogle is no fool. But in a world of hypocrisy and self-deception, deciding what is real proves a complicated task. . . .Based on real historical events, The Fraud is a dazzling novel about truth and fiction, Jamaica and Britain, fraudulence and authenticity and the mystery of \u201cother people.\u201d",

Go online and read about the Tichborne Trial and Lady Blessington and her salon. You then will understand and enjoy the novel much more.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Interesting but forgettable",
                "reviewText": "In 1870 a legendary legal case excited Victorian England. Sir Roger Tichborne, claimant to a barony and the Tichborne family fortune, found his way back to England after a prolonged stay in Brazil and having survived a shipwreck on his way home \u2014he was presumed dead for years \u2014 that sent him in a circuitous route to New South Wales, then the continent. Despite the claimant bearing little resemblance to the original Sir Roger, his mother, upon meeting him, \u201cknew in her heart\u201d he was her long-lost son. There was a catch however\u2026 For years, the mother had posted advertisements all over the world detailing the circumstances of her son\u2019s disappearance, offering a reward to someone who would know his whereabouts. Moreover, there were witnesses attesting that the claimant was indeed a butcher who had visited his family upon his arrival. Was the claimant a fraud or the real deal?Mr. Andrew Bogle, a slave Sir Roger\u2019s late uncle had met while managing the Hope estate in Jamaica and brought to England under his employ, met Sir Roger by accident in New South Wales and, recognizing his family association, accompanied him to England to solidify his claim. Mr. Bogle became a social sensation in his own right because of his inherent honesty and mild demeanor. The public, sometimes at odds with the claimant\u2019s story, chose to believe Bogle\u2019s, but was he a fraud? And, if not exactly so, was he at least guilty of unknowingly leading the claimant?Was slavery the greatest fraud of all? If a man\u2019s inherent right is to be born free, how come slavery, after oiling the cogs of the British empire for centuries, was going to be abolished by an act of Parliament?Another potential \u201cfraud\u201d was novelist William Harrison Ainsworth, contemporary of Charles Dickens whom he counted among his friends for some time before Dickens dropped him like a hot potato. Mr. Ainsworth didn\u2019t have Dickens\u2019s talent by any means, but he had a very savvy research partner who provided ample insights and bibliographic material on the historical periods Ainsworth wrote extensively and aimlessly about. He lacked Dickens\u2019s observational skills and talent to chronicle the struggles of the common people, often preferring stories about the nobility, but at one time a novel of his about a famous outlaw outsold Oliver Twist.The Fraud has a complex writing structure, the story moving back and forth between the 1830s and 1870s when focusing on the Ainsworth family, their relationship with cousin-by-marriage Eliza Touchet, and Mr. Ainsworth\u2019s outings with his famous peers. The account of Mr. Andrew Bogle and his family starts in the late 18th century in Africa and moves to Jamaica\u2014where it focuses for a while on life in the Hope Plantation and England in the 1830s\u2014, New South Wales in the 1950s, and back to England in 1870.I had a hard time thinking about what my rating of this novel would be. It is sometimes amusing, informative, somewhat dense but generally enjoyable, yet overall it is very forgettable beyond the page. It tackles issues such as aging, loneliness, marital neglect, gender politics, pressure to succeed, peer envy, systemic oppression, and the economic, social and moral impact of slavery, but all feels heavy handed rather than organic.I wish Zadie Smith had focused on either the story of Sir Roger/Mr Bogle or William Ainsworth\u2019s story on two separate books, and I wish I had liked The Fraud more, but I have read longer books this year that took me less time to read than I spent reading this one.",

                "reviewText": "This book was read for a book club. The style reminds me of a mash of Virginia Woolf and Charles Dickens. Two authors I am not really fond of. The book tells the story of Eliza Touchet. Like Virginia Woolf\u2019s Mrs. Dalloway, Eliza in her older age reflects back to her youth. She also participates in watching the Tichborne case and takes her hand at writing after being surrounded by writers.The most interesting section was the reading of Andrew Bogle\u2019s life. Fraud permeates the lives of all the characters. While the book touches on ageism, racism,classism and politics the Victorian style writing will make it a book most modern readers will find tedious to read.",

I think her technique of weaving in actual text of the times was interesting but by the end it became tedious.",

There is little really by the way of plot - the central story is of a Victorian court case where a man is accused of impersonating a wealthy aristocrat, The secondary story is of a rousing to the once very successful writer Ainsworth , contemporary, friend and rival to Dickens and Thackeray. The book also deals with some weighty matters including slavery, women's rights, poverty. class, racism, and sexuality, amongst others.It can be a confusing book at times, jumping across times and locations, but leaving the impression of a well written novel that must have required considerable research given the basis of truth in the story",
