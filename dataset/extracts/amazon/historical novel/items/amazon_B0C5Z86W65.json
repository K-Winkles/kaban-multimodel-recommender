                "reviewText": "This is one of those books that breaks your heart while it warms your soul. Set in Warsaw in September 1943, it's the story of the social workers and nurses who smuggled food and medicine into the Jewish ghetto while smuggling children out. This is told in a dual timeline with Zofia during the war and her great-granddaughter, Lizzie, in present-day Seattle. Often in dual timelines, I prefer one over the other but in this book I found each to be equally compelling.The majority of this story takes place over 5 desperate months in Warsaw, just before the historic Uprising.By 1943, the conditions inside the walled ghetto were horrific, rife with disease, overcrowding, and starvation. The life of the fictitious Zofia is brilliantly woven with the very real one of a true hero, Irena Sendler, a Polish Catholic social worker. The bravery of these women against the brutal Nazi regime was astounding as they repeatedly when into the ghetto disguised as nurses. The consequence for hiding or even feeding a single Jew was execution, often in public but it didn't stop these women.Lizzie, a teacher who has suffered multiple miscarriages, uncovers old photos of her great-grandmother Zofia and they spark a new passion to learn more about her. Many readers will identify with Lizzie as she struggles to heal on a journey to understand who she is if not a mother. It's through Lizzie that even more secrets from Warsaw are revealed.Zofia felt that \"if she helped only one poor soul it was a thousand times better than doing nothing.\" We need more Zofias in the world. It's estimated that Irena Sendler and her 10 compatriots rescued 2,500 children from the Warsaw ghetto but for every child saved, one hundred were sent to their deaths in Treblinka. It's way past time that the world learns about these courageous women who were true heroes. Let's acknowledge and celebrate who they were. Reading and sharing this book is a great start. I loved it.I received a complimentary advanced reading copy of this book from Avon Books UK through NetGalley. All opinions and the review are my own.",

                "reviewText": "I can't remember the last time I cried so much while reading a book. There was so much devastation within the pages. I am amazed that the people of Warsaw were able to rise from the ashes.I found myself obsessed. The author's words grabbed me. I wanted to know more and more. I wanted to read about the heroism and dedication. The more I learned the more crushed I became. The more I read the more I needed to discover truths. I found those truths. I was horrified. Daughter of Warsaw guided me in ways I had not been before.The determination of resistance workers left me in awe. Daughters of Warsaw helped me create a picture in my mind of the dedication of those trying to save the Jewish children in the ghetto. The Jewish people lived in such squaller.One of the reasons I read World War Two historical fiction is to attempt to understand why and how it happened. I find myself at a loss. The horrors, the atrocities. I am left speechless over the strength they must have had to go on as they did.Maria Frances has taken the dry words of history textbooks and humanized them. She has taken what many have tried to brush under the rug and brought it into the light. She has put faces to names. She has built the ghettos in my mind in away that they will remain forever.We all need the horrors brought to life so we don't need to repeat them. Our imaginations should be enough to make sure it never happens again. Too make sure we must read more, learn more.",

                "reviewText": "A beautiful, heartening story.Daughters Of Warsaw Is a story that broke my heart into millions but, at the same time, was inspirational for me. It\u2019s not a book that you will be able to put down once you start reading it. Some parts of the book are hard to read, but you will find yourself to keep turning the pages. I loved that it was another dual-timeline book that connected the characters. Like Lizzie, I was curious about what she was going to discover. I think that finding that hidden photograph of her great-grandmother helped her heal from her loss. I don\u2019t think she expected to find out what she had when she came across her picture. I loved the transition between Lizzie and Sofia and felt I was being transformed into both timelines.Through the years, I have read a few books about resistance. Those are my favorite books. Sofia was doing what she knew was right, but hiding from her parents and sister couldn\u2019t be easy. If I were in her position, I wouldn\u2019t been able to hide it, or I would have left because I would be afraid to put my family at risk. Daughters Of Warsaw was such a beautifully written story, and it was clear how much research was put into it. I haven\u2019t read any book by Maria Frances before, and I\u2019m glad I got to check her book out. I would highly recommend this to any historical fiction fans. After reading this book, I\u2019m eager to see what\u2019s next for Maria Frances",
