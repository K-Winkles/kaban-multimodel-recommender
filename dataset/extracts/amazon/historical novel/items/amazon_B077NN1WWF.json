        "description": "From the New York Times best-selling authors of America's First Daughter comes the epic story of Eliza Schuyler Hamilton - a revolutionary woman who, like her new nation, struggled to define herself in the wake of war, betrayal, and tragedy. In this haunting, moving, and beautifully written book, Dray and Kamoie used thousands of letters and original sources to tell Eliza's story as it's never been told before - not just as the wronged wife at the center of a political sex scandal but also as a founding mother who shaped an American legacy in her own right. A general's daughter... Coming of age on the perilous frontier of revolutionary New York, Elizabeth Schuyler champions the fight for independence. And when she meets Alexander Hamilton, Washington's penniless but passionate aide-de-camp, she's captivated by the young officer's charisma and brilliance. They fall in love, despite Hamilton's bastard birth and the uncertainties of war. A founding father's wife... But the union they create - in their marriage and the new nation - is far from perfect. From glittering inaugural balls to bloody street riots, the Hamiltons are at the center of it all - including the political treachery of America's first sex scandal, which forces Eliza to struggle through heartbreak and betrayal to find forgiveness. The last surviving light of the Revolution... When a duel destroys Eliza's hard-won peace, the grieving widow fights her husband's enemies to preserve Alexander's legacy. But long-buried secrets threaten everything Eliza believes about her marriage and her own legacy. Questioning her tireless devotion to the man and country that have broken her heart, she's left with one last battle - to understand the flawed man she married and the imperfect union he could never have created without her....

                "reviewText": "My Dear Hamilton: A Novel of Eliza Schuyler Hamilton by Stephanie Dray and Laura Kamoie, is an epic story written in the voice of Alexander Hamilton\u2019s wife.The novel covers the period of 1777 through 1837. Elizabeth Schuyler, the daughter of a general, grows up in colonial North America during the American Revolution. When she meets a young officer, Alexander Hamilton, she\u2019s captivated by his charisma and brilliance and falls in love despite his perceived shameful bastard birth and the uncertainties of war.Elizabeth, or Eliza, as she prefers to be called, finds herself in the thick of war, ugly politics, even scandal. Hamilton is revered by many, but also has powerful political enemies. The Hamiltons joyfully celebrate the inauguration of George Washington, the nation\u2019s first president. The two main political parties of the day are the Federalists, President Washington\u2019s party, created largely by Alexander Hamilton, and the rival Republican party, formed by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.The Hamiltons have several children and Eliza works hard as a wife and mother. Although many in high office have slaves, the Hamiltons firmly believe in the concept of the Constitution, that all men are created equal, applies to all, including slaves and women. They believe slavery is cruel, a sin against God, and a betrayal to the principles of the revolution. Eliza not only makes due with their meager finances, she helps her husband with his speeches and social obligations. They have a loving and supportive marriage.When a sex scandal encroaches her own home, Eliza struggles through heartbreak and betrayal to find forgiveness. She is a strong woman, a woman of passion and principles. Eliza finds the strength to face the humiliation, the gossip mongers, the cruel newspaper accusations. Eliza is an inspiration, an American legacy in her own right.My Dear Hamilton is a large volume\u2014672 pages\u2014that held my fascinated attention throughout. I learned so much about the attitudes and conditions of our nation\u2019s early years. Alexander Hamilton was a remarkable man. He fought and helped win a war, raising to the rank of general. He was instrumental in building a federal government. He created a coast guard, a national bank, and devised a scheme of taxation that held the states together. He was brilliant, but flawed, as Eliza was to learn. I loved reading about our country\u2019s early days and I appreciate even more what it took to establish our great nation.",

                "reviewText": "A collaboration of two very talented writers brings an insightful image of a remarkable woman Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton: \u201c\u2026the boyish sort of girl who preferred climbing trees and hiking through the woods, or the veritable spinster, more concerned with nursing sick soldiers than landing one for a husband.\u201d But Alexander Hamilton\u2019s love had changed everything.1780 Morristown, New Jersey. On a cold winter day \u201cand in the darkest hour of the war,\u201d Eliza carries a letter from her father to General Washington at Ford Mansion. At the bustling headquarters, she meets a young aide-de-camp Alexander Hamilton.Their attraction is instant. He is torn, because of his background of illegitimacy, not matching her social status. But she accepts him. His manners, intelligence and ambition are what matters to her.As a wife, she learns how to manage temperamental outbursts of her husband. And she learns from an experienced wife, namely Mrs. Washington. \u201cSometimes we encourage, sometimes we challenge, and sometimes we manage\u2026\u201d1783 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Now, a congressman\u2019s wife as Hamilton was \u201celected to serve as one of New York\u2019s five delegates to the Congress of the Confederation.\u201dThe Treaty of Paris grants America her independence, forcing the British soldier to leave the newly forming lands. With that, the aftermath brings unstable currency, hostility, and the lawlessness. \u201cNo sooner had we driven the king from our shores than we seemed intent on proving that we were uncivilized people who couldn\u2019t live without a monarch to keep us from behaving as beasts.\u201dThe confrontation continues with those for or against a strong central government.When George Washington becomes the first President, Alexander Hamilton becomes the first Secretary of the Treasury.As Hamilton\u2019s career advances, his private life takes a different turn. He claims it was a set up involving a woman. And now he is blackmailed for adultery.He \u201cembroiled himself in two affairs of honor in the space of an hour.\u201dYears later, another duel doesn\u2019t go well for Hamilton.Told with impeccable prose and smooth dialogue, progressing easily and naturally. The etiquette of ballrooms, rivalry of soldiers, courtly manners and intelligence come alive in this complex story.Set against the wars for independence and conspiring time to build a new country free of king, with its new laws. It brings a very insightful history lesson, full of ambition, rivalry and love. A very passionate love for creating a new nation.Above all, this is a story of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton. A woman who went through marriage and motherhood, who experienced losing a husband, child and a sister who was also a very close friend and confidante. Her feelings and emotions through all this are movingly depicted.",
