I am going to believe that Rose sends Polly on a magnificent honeymoon and provides marvelous experiences for the newlyweds. Posh hotels and swanky cars!",

Rose never wanted to leave Ballykillen, a small country village on the coast of Ireland, with a river running through it, while Polly dreamt of bigger and better things away from the village. When the girls had left school Polly got them both a job as Chamberlain in a big hotel in Cork, which was less than 20 miles from home but felt it was the start of a new life for them. A guest at hotel struck up a conversation with Rose eventually leading to fer going to England to 'look after his wife,Alice and son Raffi. War came and Rose found herself sailing to the USA, with Alice, Raffi and new baby Sarah, Rose and Sarah being the only two to survive that journey. Find out what happens to Rose before it comes to a happy ending. I recommend reading this book for all who like to have a happy ending.",
