                "reviewText": "Insecure, bullied ex-Etonian, Eric Arthur Blair (George Orwell) becomes a policeman in Burma. Blair is a tall, gangly chap who finds people and relationships a burden. His inner world is far richer. Blair is withdrawn. His passion is books. That list is certainly edgy. Huxley, Lawrence for a starters. Inside he\u2019s a rebel, an agitator. However he\u2019s nineteen years old and en route to Burma as a training policeman with the Imperial Forces.\u201c [Blair\u2019s] detachment remained, the hovering, watchful self, seeing the young man in the jacket and tie on deck, like a character in a story, knowing what the young man was hesitant to admit: that he was uncertain; that he really didn\u2019t have a clue; that he was to be a policeman.Blair\u2019s life in Burma will be very different to the life he dreams of. A puzzle he has to somehow push through. An outsider trying to find his way in.Burma has a strong culture dating down through the centuries, rich in food, in color and movement. Paradise with more than a sting in its tail. A culture disdained by its imperial masters. Welcome to the British Raj.He\u2019ll confront jingoism, culture wars, attitudes to mixed races, women, and troubling juxtapositions about life and viewpoints. He is introduced to pleasures of the flesh, he finds love only to realize its limitations. He canes prisoners and sees himself back at Eton being bullied. He hates his actions. He feels unclean. His conscience is troubled. However his survival is reckoned on sticking with the status quo\u2014the Sahibs.That means hiding the fact that he has two half caste uncles, and cousins. Relatives he wants to hide for reasons of his own acceptance, as much as for their protection from insular snobbery and disdain.Burma, part of Britain\u2019s far flung empire, a place the British cling to and impose their rule of law on.The story of this troubled, non conformist, who conforms in the worst possible way, is broken open in the worst way possible. Blair finally escapes to a different and we can only hope more satisfying future.Last we see Blair, he is immersing himself in sociological investigations in the north of England. He writes under his other persona, George. The name he gave his writing self in Burma.An intriguing novel that immerses the reader in the Imperial Police Force and has the main character pondering questions. Yet those questions are silenced, submerged by tradition and rules, unwritten and written. Judgement to the letter of the law with very little scope for compassion. Blair becomes part of the very system he condemns. A proper Burma Sahib, on the outside. Inside he\u2019s a tortured, conflicted soul.Eric Blair is a character not soon forgotten. George Orwell didn\u2019t. This fictionalised tale of Orwell\u2019s early years is thought provoking and brilliant!A Mariner Books ARC via NetGalley.Many thanks to the author and publisher.Please note: Quotes taken from an advanced reading copy maybe subject to change(Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.)",

                "reviewText": "Paul Theroux\u2019s latest novel (his 30th, I think) is a fictional account of a formative period in the life of Eric Blair, the man who became George Orwell. The book comes with the usual disclaimers for a work of fiction about a real person: \u201c \u201cNames [etc.] \u2026 are products of the author\u2019s imagination. . . . not to be construed as real . . . any resemblance . . . entirely coincidental.\u201dBut I don\u2019t believe him. That is, I will grant that the British characters Blair interacts with in the book--all believable in their vocabulary, their backgrounds, their usually terrible behavior as British military policemen, their complacent acceptance of their role as colonial overseers for the empire, and their attitudes toward Blair\u2019s struggles and failures in that role\u2014are imagined.And I will grant that the believable natives in Blair\u2019s world\u2014the Burmese, the Indians and the other \u201cOrientals,\u201d as Blair calls them\u2014the men who obediently and zealously perform their duties as Blair\u2019s subordinates in the police; the robbers and rapists and other miscreants who are the ostensible reason that the British police force exists at all and are the targets of British zest for cruelty; the angry mobs who threaten British control and are the real reason for the police; and the Indian merchant, fluent in English, with a most English last name (Thackeray!), who becomes Blair\u2019s closest friend and Blair\u2019s confessor\u2014are imagined.And I grant that the believable women Blair gets involved with\u2014his selfish idealized attachments to his \u201ckeeps\u201d (you\u2019ll have to read the book to find out what that means) and to the one woman with whom he thinks he has fallen in love\u2014and the sex scenes that leave little to the imagination\u2014are imagined.But Theroux\u2019s beautiful passages that immerse us in the landscape of Burma, its birds, its flowers, its trees and foliage, its rivers and creeks\u2014its sensuality\u2014certainly are not imagined.And I am convinced that the Blair in Theroux\u2019s novel is not a fiction. I refuse to believe that the Blair who spurns the usual progression of a British schoolboy from Eton to Oxbridge and instead goes to Burma\u2014his Oxford as he says--to be a policeman, is imagined.The Blair who says upon his arrival in Burma: \u201cI hate this, I shouldn\u2019t be here, I will never succeed\u201d\u2014is not imagined. The Blair who is self-conscious about being tall, who can feel clumsy and ugly, is ashamed of his parents, who is incapable of refusing an order even though he almost always wants to, who feels his role as a policeman is turning him into someone he despises, I believe this is the real Eric Blair.When we see Blair recognize the inevitability of seeing his life in Burma through the eyes and words of Kipling or reading and admiring and wishing he could write like his heroes: Jack London, Butler, Wells, Lawrence, Maugham, and dismissing the writers\u2014Huxley, Forster--he believes waste his time or get it all wrong, we are seeing the real Eric Blair.When Theroux slowly reveals for us the emergence of Blair\u2019s secret self\u2014the rebel who despises authority, the diarist, the notetaker who sees salvation in writing-- who becomes the someone he had always known was inside him, \u201cthe inner man Blair thought of as George,\u201d Theroux is telling us about the real Eric Blair.Throughout the book Theroux gives us hints of some of the books and essays Eric Blair will write once he becomes George Orwell: Burmese Days, obviously; \u201cShooting an Elephant\u201d; Down and Out in Paris and London (because \u201cbeing a tramp was a proper vocation and a refuge\u201d); Animal Farm (where some are more equal than others); and--when a colleague of Blair says at one point \u201cthe rat has its uses,\u201d and Blair is appalled at seeing a dead man\u2019s face that has been gnawed by a rat; and when Blair visits a prison built around a panopticon and asks himself \u201cwhat if a whole society was a panopticon with a tyrant at its center in the watchtower,\u201d an all-seeing eye--1984.Theroux\u2019s Blair thinks that readers \u201cget to know fictional characters with more intimacy than any living person.\u201d Well, by the end of Burma Sahib, the reader knows the formative experiences and ideas of Eric Blair\u2014of George Orwell, the most influential writer of the 20th century-- more intimately than it is possible to know from any biography. This is Paul Theroux\u2019s great achievement in this great book.An advance copy in galley form via NetGalley.My thanks to author and publisher.Please note: Quotes taken from a galley may change in the final version.(Opinions expressed here are my own.)",
