                "reviewText": "\u2018The Exiles\u2019 is a delightful book, a big fat shiny five stars. The subject matter is so relevant, even today. The penal colonies of Australia are a repugnant blotch in England\u2019s expansive history, although many other nations can credit themselves with their own disgusting pages in their own histories. The 1840\u2019s, the particular period of this novel, was a flourishing time for the fortunate, but for the unfortunate masses that polite society deemed different for whatever petty reason, life presented a daily struggle to survive, a varied version of hell on earth. But my purpose is to review this wonderful book, not to pass judgement on any nation\u2019s failing.Evangeline is a delightful character and I felt a connection with her right away. Pressured into an affair resulting in pregnancy, she is accused of stealing a gift from her lover. Fourteen years transportation. Prison in Australia. A lot has been said about Evangeline\u2019s naivete and her surprising story arc. I believe she was no more na\u00efve than most girls her age, facing similar circumstances. I also commend Kline for making such a bold move in Evangeline\u2019s story. The nerve! Difficult to read but grittily real in its happening. And then there was Mathinna, the aboriginal young orphan. I felt for her as well, enduring the bigotry of the colonial English rulers. Her story arc was also amazing and at the same time, realistically distressing. But all the characters were very credible, some, like Hazel and even Olive, were inspirational. The dialogue was spot on. The prose was beautiful, yet at times as rugged as the locale. Kline expertly places the reader on the high seas aboard a slave ship, then in the dark, dank, Hades-like prison known as The Cascades. I felt a link, albeit safe, with the convicts as they endured the hell of their days spent in solitary. The blunt hopelessness of their dreadful day to day lives.Kline provides a moral of a sort. A lesson to be learned. \u201cHazel had made a life for herself that would not have been possible in Great Britain, where the circumstances of her birth would\u2019ve almost certainly determined the story of her future.\u201d The hardships that people endure to achieve a better life, for themselves and their children, always makes such a great story. Kline tells it splendidly.",

                "reviewText": "Christine Baker Kline's beautifully crafted novel about the prison ships heading to the wilds of Australia with convicts, that in this instance were women. These women convicts were in most cases sentenced to harsh penalties for crimes that that didn't merit such terrible punishment's-pickpockets, harlots, debauchery.There are two concomitant stories, one takes place in England. It begins with Evangeline Stokes a young innocent governess, who through her misdeeds in service to her upper class employers was sentenced to 14 years of incarceration, beginning with her transport from England to Australia on a prison ship. Evangeline's friendship with a young woman named Hazel Ferguson. Their relationship changes both their lives. Hazel ultimately becomes the central figure in the book.The second story is about a young girl named Mathinna, an aborigines child of the Palawa tribe who ended up living with an English royal couple, Lord and Lady Franklin. oversaw the prisoner island of Van Diemen's Land which we know today as Tasmania. Mathinna was given a home with the Franklins mainly as an experiment to try and educate and \"tame\" this \"wild\" native to see if they could ultimately fit her into English society. The free Settlers from England viewed the Aboriginal population basically as savages.How these two young women come together in the story during the last third of the book.The thrust of the story is about women who fight against prejudice, the unjust, and unfair moral code that men are not a part of but women are. They fight for justice in a world dominated by men in order to be part of society to which they have so much to give.It is also a moving story about the stratagems of social class in that the rich have all the power and are always right, the poor have no power and are always wrong.Kline's research for this book is incredibly deep and accurate. The vivid descriptions of this wild continent of Australia in the middle 1800s, the intense agony and harsh conditions in which these women lived as prisoners brings you full throttle into a story you will not soon forget..",

Frustratingly, I'm unable to do this in the UK but would be able to in the US. Please Amazon, can you make the 2 available at the same time please? I thought about delaying reading this and maybe should have done so.I have now finished this. It is an excellent and thoroughly researched novel about women exiled to a penal colony in Van Diemen's Land in 1840 and to a lesser degree, the impact of British colonialism on the native people of Australia. I found it both gripping and interestingly detailed about every aspect of convict life in Hobart Prison.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed this but it was somehow lacking in depth of characterisation! I couldn't fully connect with the main characters. They were a little empty and so didn't quite give the subject matter the oomph it deserves!!I was drawn to this by the title because back in the early 80's as a young teenager my mum and myself read a book called The Exiles by Vivian Stuart, the first of The Australians series of, I believe, 6 books! About a young girl who ends up in Newgate prison and is shipped off on the convict ships!I still have that battered, dog eared book that my long gone mum bought 2nd hand from a market stall back in about 1981. It still is probably my most favourite, or at least in the top 3 of my best books ever!!!My Mum read the series but I was new to the adult section in the library and wanted to read EVERYTHING hahaha! How I wish we had bought them all back then, as they now cost a fortune as 2nd hand copies! That gave the subject matter the justice it deserves and I still remember it today.Maybe that is why I can't quite give this book a better review! However I have read some of the blurbs on her other titles and have saved them to my, to read list, hence the 4* because it may not have lived up to what I wanted it to, but I did enjoy her writing!",
