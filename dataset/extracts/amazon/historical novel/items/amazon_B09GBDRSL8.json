                "reviewText": "I admit I am a huge fan of Ms. Ackerman, having now bought and read all of her books. My short review: this one may be my favorite so far. It builds links between the attack on Pearl Harbor and the opening of the Manual Kea Hotel in 1965 on the Big Island. Great characters, even the minor ones, enough Hawai\u2019ian flavor (though less \u201clocal\u201d than some of her other books), poignant story, and as usual with her, I learned something new, here about our female codebreakers. There are a lot of convenient coincidences, but I loved them. I usually read pretty dense stuff, and read rather quickly, so I finished the book in about three hours, but they were three delightful hours. Extremely enjoyable book.I write this review as someone with strong ties to Hawai\u2019i, having lived in Honolulu from the 7th to 9th grades in the early Sixties, and having spent a fair amount of time on three of the other four major islands. I last visited the big island in 1989, circumnavigating it with my new family, so all of the places mentioned were familiar to me, and accurately depicted. I shudder to imagine what Kona must look like now. But part of me will always be in Hawai\u2019i in spirit, the most beautiful place I have been in this world, and I have been a lot of places in my 75 years. Ms. Ackerman always gives me a lift in that regard, even though she is a Big Islander and my heart belongs to the north shore of Kaua\u2019i.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I loved this book because it focuses on the Pacific Theater of WW II, which tends to get overshadowed by books on the European Theater. It also takes place in Oahu and The Big Island, which I had just spent 2+weeks visiting, so I had a personal interest. I found the history to be very interesting, the storyline intriguing and there is a relatively happy ending with romance involved. My only critic is that the story seemed a bit contrived in order to make all the pieces fit together nicely in the end. Still, I really did enjoy the book and would recommend to anyone interested in the topics of WW II and the Hawaiian Islands.",

Her dream is to go to Hawaii and retrace the steps of her big brother, Walt, who died at Pearl Harbor. She gets her chance to work with a group of all male colleagues and she soon tracks down her brother's best friend, hot shot pilot Matteo. Sparks fly between the two. She is struggling to decipher codes that can help win the war.Our other time line is set in 1965, still in Hawaii. Journalist Luana Freitas has been asked to cover the grand opening of one of the Rockefeller's newest projects, a spectacular new hotel, the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel. Lu befriends the crotchety photographer assigned to cover the opening and together the get wrapped in the murder mystery of one of the elite guests.I loved the twists and turns, the descriptions that made me feel like I was in Hawaii and all the characters.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fI highly recommend it and absolutely loved our chat with the author last night.#bookfriendsbookclub#bookstagram#crazybooknerd#historicalfiction",
