Not terrible, just not great. In the beginning the MC had a change of fortune, and everyone who met her suddenly told her she was a wonderful person out of the blue for no reason whatsoever.... the author does things like that. It's almost as if the writer was trying to set up the story to go in a particular direction but was unable to work out how, so she just skipped the process in the middle and leapt over to the end result. This made some of the connections the author made look ridiculous although they moved the story along. The story idea was a lovely and I think it would have been wonderful if well- executed. Unfortunately, it wasn't and I would not pick up something else written by the author in future.",

Ms Taylor writes with simplicity but that in no way detracts from the storyline. This is about love, loss, forgiveness and starting over. I enjoyed the many Irish sayings, such as, \u201cJesus, Mary and the holy Saint Joseph\u201d or \u201cbloody\u201d and many others. I recommend this book and the author, Sandy Taylor.",
