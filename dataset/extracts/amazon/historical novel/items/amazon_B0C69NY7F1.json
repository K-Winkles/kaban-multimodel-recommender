I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the Titanic or wants to know something about what it was like. Very well done",

                "reviewText": "It took me a few chapters to really get into this book but once the characters became familiar I was drawn into their stories. It was an interesting way of looking at the tragedy of the Titanic. By bringing real victims of the sinking of the ship into focus as human beings with glimpses into their lives it gave the tragic loss of so many lives more impact. It is a well written, well researched, fresh look at an event that still shocks us 112 years after the \"unsinkable\" ship went down.",

Told very well via different narrators (which confused me at first) but stick with it. Vivid descriptions of the ships, passengers, invented conversations but all mesh nicely. First book Ive read by this author--although her other books/subject matter don't really interest me.",

                "reviewText": "The author did a stunning job of telling this story focusing on two main characters. One was of the privileged rich, and the other a first class steward on the Titanic.. both of these characters meet under terrible circumstances, but each reach out to the other to survive not only the sinking but beyond.This novel made me very emotional, but uplifted at the same time. The Scottish blessing of the sheltering angel is such an appropriate name for this novel.I highly recommend it. I\u2019m going to buy the hardcopy of the book and read it again.",

It is still such a terrible loss even though it happened so long ago. I read this book because we recently went to the Titanic museum and also because we recently as a country lost a sub on a mission to the Titanic. It was sad to hear that the wife of that sub commander who perished was related to Isisidor Strauss who perished on the Titanic with his wife. History does repeat itself. Its hard not to be curious of the events.",
