It didn\u2019t just take place in England, instead it starts on a ship mid Atlantic from England to Civil War era America, then to France, and back to England. Bronwyn and Valentine are like a historical Mr. and Mrs. Smith and I am here for it!While I admit to wanting to knock some sense into both of the characters a few times, I loved both of them! Amalie Howard always does a strong and independent Lady and broody Duke so well and this book was no different! I feel like a lot of historical romances are slow burn but this one was a little faster and I\u2019m so thankful it was because their chemistry was obvious from the first page.There are definitely some interesting side characters that I hope get their stories, but I have no idea who it could possibly be so I will be waiting on the edge of my seat to find out, because I absolutely love this series!",

A starchy duke who cannot hang onto his cool to save his life where the heroine is concerned. She\u2019s sheer kamikaze to his self-control.2. Innuendoes and banter that will make your head spin with their crackling intensity and barely masked antagonism.3. A fiercely independent heroine who refuses to let the restrictions society places on her gender deter her from pursuing what she wants.4. Some of my favorite mini-tropes\u2026 including bathtime teasing, and hot times against a tree.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Interesting read - but too \"contemporary\" for me",
                "reviewText": "Lady Bronwyn Chase, the half-sister of Courtland Chase, the Duke of Ashvale, didn\u2019t intentionally set out to be a spy, rather she stumbled into espionage. But once she had a taste, she was hooked and began working for an agent of the crown, just passing on the occasional message, but it soon became apparent that she was actually good at it and the \u201cKestrel\u201d was born and caught the interest of other agents, particularly Valentine Medford, the new Duke of Thornbury, a retired agent who is helping his former partner track the Kestrel. Which is how they all end up on a ship bound for Philadelphia in March of 1865.Bronwyn plays her part as a shallow, self-absorbed debutante to perfection and annoys Thornbury to no end. Bronwyn has long had a crush on Thornbury, but he is one of her brother\u2019s best friends and until recently, married, so he is off-limits \u2013 or is he? She reminds herself that she has a mission and can\u2019t waste time mooning over a man who could never love her and one who is too smart to fool for long with her foolish society girl facade, so she tries to avoid him and focus on her mission.Valentine doesn\u2019t know that she is the Kestrel, but isn\u2019t happy about her traipsing about Philadelphia alone and wonders what she is up to. He follows her and is stunned to see what she is up to. And when her mission goes awry and her life is on the line, he wastes no time saving her. But when she turns the tables and saves him, twice \u2013 everything changes and he finds himself torn between duty and desire.This was a very interesting read and I am torn about how to rate this \u2013 as far as writing, plot, and character development are concerned, the book is spot on with lots of action, steamy love scenes, interesting characters, true historical events tie-ins, and a HEA, but it is supposed to be a \u201chistorical romance\u201d set in the very uptight Victoria Era and that is where it doesn\u2019t work for me. The characters have very progressive, modern views on sex, relationships, and equality, that came across as very cavalier, making this more of a \u201ccontemporary in period dress\u201d than a true to the era historical. Then there were things that just shook me \u2013 the hero is \u201cdivorced\u201d which is almost unheard of in the Victorian era and would take years to accomplish as well as an act of Parliament and a lot of money, not to mention a better reason than \u201cwe wanted different things\u201d, but they apparently got it done quickly and quietly and he and his ex are still friends and everyone seems to think this is no big deal as they are not shunned and are still accepted everywhere \u2013 but then it is implied that they were not really married, even though the ex still uses the title that she had as his \u201cwife\u201d, but the hero never tells the heroine any of this, which bothered me probably more than it should have. And don\u2019t even get me started on the virgin heroine\u2019s attitude toward sex. I understand that authors are trying to appeal to a 21st-century audience and the popularity of shows like Bridgerton has brought a host of new readers who are not familiar with the rules and strictures of the eras and would be put off by them \u2013 so there has to be some leeway \u2013 but I feel that this one went too far \u2013 I read historicals for those strictures and rules and how different times were \u2013 making characters \u201ctoo modern\u201d ruins that for me and honestly by implying that the views of the day were the same as they are now, diminishes the challenges and hardships people in that time overcame and in some cases are still overcoming. But that is just my personal opinion and if adherence to historical protocols isn\u2019t a big deal for you \u2013 I am sure you will really enjoy this story. This is the third book in the series, but it could easily be read and enjoyed as a standalone title.*I am voluntarily leaving a review for an eARC that I requested and was provided to me by the publisher. All opinions in this review are my own.*",
