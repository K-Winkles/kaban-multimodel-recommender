                "reviewText": "Begorrah! And its a lovely tale to to be repeated forever.Its actually a story about murder and vengeance and how the Irish slowly came to embrace the Catholic Church .The story unfolds with a terrible beating of a young woman found by the side of the road. Beaten, stabbed and joints broken and now being found by a passing stranger, she's carried to a Convent overseen by a very caring and wise Mother Superior.Seeing how this is the medieval Ireland there are many instances of the Irish language, Gaelic, abundantly inserted in the story.It's a bit difficult to figure out at times but the author has included a handy reference of pronunciation and meaning thereof.What will happen to the young lady is always a question and keeps you interested throughout the book. Will she exact revenge or will new faith show a different way?One takeaway from the story is, should you ever get the chance to visit Ireland .....take an umbrella!",

The long, slow path to the revelation of the truth was worth it, though. And the characters all seemed like very real people of their time.Only two things bugged me: one was the excessive use of Irish terms (it's hard to keep referring to a glossary in an ebook), and the other was the use of present-tense storytelling (which is currently very popular, but not preferred by me).",

                "reviewText": "It makes me sad to write this review and I wavered between 2 and 3 stars because I really wanted to like this book. It opens strongly, with severe injures to an intelligent, appealing heroine and ends with a tentative, lukewarm thud. The reveal of the attacker, what should be the climax of the book, is vague and emotionless. Aine/Cuimne\u2019s reaction is similarly equivocal. (Potential spoiler alert) When she learns the identity of her attacker and brother\u2019s killer she\u2019s confused? She seeks no justice, seemingly feels no anger (let alone terror) turns to needlepoint and simply lets it all go? Then, conveniently, the wife of her love interest suddenly wants to join the order and make sure he has someone younger to give him children and offers him up basically on a silver platter? Sure.In the first half of the book I felt the characters\u2019 motivation. They were three dimensional flesh and blood people living In a fully realized, full color world. Then that feeling slowly leached away leaving a colorless, gray, dull hodgepodge that was part history lesson, part language training, and thoroughly unsatisfying.After the obviously thorough research, and creating a heroine I truly empathized with, the ending was so facile and rushed I felt incredibly let down. Aine and I deserve better!",

The mystery was solved at the end, but the resolution was unstatisfying for me. It did however fit in with the strong theme of Christian forgiveness that runs through the novel.The best part about this book is the glimpse of medieval Ireland that it gives you.",

                "reviewText": "Kristin Gleeson has written a wonderful story based on an incredibly generous community of women in Ireland in Medieval times. A glorious and unique story about 6th Century Ireland, it is excellent historical fiction - both fascinating and gentle. I like the fact that it has many strong, intelligent female characters in it. I'm not normally one for historical fiction of that period, but the theme of bees attracted me to the title and I was most intrigued by the premise.A farmer and his son discover an unknown women (\u00c1ine's) in a ditch with bones broken and her body covered in blood. She is taken to the convent (abbess), M\u00e1thair Gobnait, who is known for her healing through honey and herbs.She observes a community of nuns intent on celebrating God and healing the sick, which opens up a sense of peace to her life and in her soul. As \u00c1ine recovers, listening to the hymns and sounds of worship her body, mind and soul recover. We long for \u00c1ine to remember her past if only to find out the nature of her attacker. We follow this young woman's story through her conversion to Christianity, recovering of memories, and the choices she has to make.Later canonized as Patron Saint of bees, Mother Gobnait is portrayed as warm and wise, overseeing all the practical tasks in this self-sufficient community. And of course she is an expert beekeeper, passing on her love of bees to her newest follower, Aine. The overarching story of Aine's recovering her memory and facing what this means for her is unveiled slowly... to the hard choice she must make, as she remembers people from her past life.I enjoyed Kristin Gleeson's writing very much she portrays relationships realistically and draws out the characters well, if you like historical fiction this is a great tale to enjoy. This is a definite 5 star read.PS:- Throughout the book there is Gaelic Language interwoven throughout which can be confusing, there is a glossary in the back which helps...",
