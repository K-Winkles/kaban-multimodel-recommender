        "description": "From the bestselling author of The Ragged Edge of Night comes a powerful and poetic novel of survival and sacrifice on the American frontier.Wyoming, 1876. For as long as they have lived on the frontier, the Bemis and Webber families have relied on each other. With no other settlers for miles, it is a matter of survival. But when Ernest Bemis finds his wife, Cora, in a compromising situation with their neighbor, he doesn\u2019t think of survival. In one impulsive moment, a man is dead, Ernest is off to prison, and the women left behind are divided by rage and remorse.Losing her husband to Cora\u2019s indiscretion is another hardship for stoic Nettie Mae. But as a brutal Wyoming winter bears down, Cora and Nettie Mae have no choice but to come together as one family\u2015to share the duties of working the land and raising their children. There\u2019s Nettie Mae\u2019s son, Clyde\u2015no longer a boy, but not yet a man\u2015who must navigate the road to adulthood without a father to guide him, and Cora\u2019s daughter, Beulah, who is as wild and untamable as her prairie home.Bound by the uncommon threads in their lives and the challenges that lie ahead, Cora and Nettie Mae begin to forge an unexpected sisterhood. But when a love blossoms between Clyde and Beulah, bonds are once again tested, and these two resilient women must finally decide whether they can learn to trust each other\u2015or else risk losing everything they hold dear.",

Each character was so well defined, they seemed real. When one was cleaning parsnips, I could see and feel them in my hands. My only issue was an animal that was born severely deformed, no chance of survival. The author took a mystical approach to the situation, which didn't ring true on any level. When a animal is suffering like that, it should be dispatched, ASAP. So I really didn't agree with that at all.",

However, instead of boring us to death with a bunch of historical facts, she takes turns telling the story from the point of view of the different characters in such a way that you become completely immersed in their lives and can\u2019t wait to turn the page to see what happens next. The way she described the land, the layout, the details in the landscape, and in the contact characters\u2019 homes, would enable an artist to re-create those scenes accurately. While I had never heard of her prior to reading this novel, I spent about three days on the last chapter, as I did not want the story to end. As I finished the last few pages this morning, the first thing I did was come back on and order another one of her books. I will treasure this book to study the craft of writing historical fiction, based on my own genealogical research, and family artifacts.",

                "reviewText": "I feel some obligation to mention something other reviewers didn't - or not that I saw, anyway. But this book is centered on death. People die, some by the hand of others, some by accident, some by means unknown, while others simply disappear. Animals die, too, in every way. Many are slaughtered, lots more suffer accidents, are others hunted or merely killed, and some manage to escape... but none of them are free of the threat of death any any given moment.I didn't downgrade the book because of predilection, however -- the death scenes, both human and animal, are not gratuitous. On the contrary, I'm sure this depiction of prairie life in that place, during those times, was perfectly accurate. \"Rachel's Caloff's Story\" a book written by her Caloff's granddaughter, is a non-fiction account of this same area and time. It tells much of the same story, only in Caloff's case, she mentions that indeed, some of the women did literally lose their minds, stuck alone out there on the prairie, faced with extreme hardship and the need for more hard physical labor than few adults could manage, long term. In fact, my one set of grandparents also homesteaded like this, in North Dakota, in a similar sod hot -- but they never told me -- or indeed anyone else -- as much as one word about the experience. For as long as they lived, neither of them could ever be persuaded to talk about those years to anyone. It must have been dreadful.Perhaps we all agree that there is a time and place to read various kinds of books. My only suggesting is that this is a profoundly sad and/or depressing book. Yes, there are moments of transcendence, but not very many. And not for long. If this would be a bad time for you to enter this most difficult world, then put this book aside for later. On the other hand, if the notion of shared misery gives you a lift, you couldn't do better than this one.Please note that in general I appreciated -- can't say 'enjoyed' -- this book. I never felt like stopping listening, although I did fast-forward a few times when the animal slaughter got too much for me, a process called \"culling the herd\". That I simply couldn't take. If you can handle this kind of raw reportage of an extremely difficult time in America, this is a book you won't want to miss.",
