                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A Profound and Haunting Novel About Korean History. But Beware! It's Slow-Going in the Beginning",
                "reviewText": "There are two types of readers: Those who finish a book\u2014no matter what\u2014just because they started it and those who give a book a few pages\u201410, 20, 50\u2014and then give up if it's not that good. If you fall into the latter category, be cautious reading this novel by Juhea Kim. It's very slow-going until about one-third of the way through. That's about 135 pages for something that can feel like a slog at times. But then, almost like magic, the story picks up. While I wouldn't describe this book as \"riveting,\" it is still very good.This is a love story, mostly about the heartbreak of unrequited love. This is a story about the cruelty and vagaries of the most basic kind of human survival. This is a story about family bonds and tests of loyalty. This is a story about patriotism and honor. But most of all, this is the story of the Korean independence movement after decades of suffering under Japanese rule. Throughout the book, author Juhea Kim cleverly weaves into the story abundant symbols of the tiger\u2014for courage, ferocity, strength, and ambition.Taking place from 1917 to 1965, the four main characters around which the story revolves are:\u2022 Jade Anh and Miss Lotus, who are little girls when they first meet in Pyongyang at a school for training courtesans. Lotus was born into it, while Jade's mother sold her into it and then told her to never return to her family because she would forever be a disgrace to them.\u2022 Nam JungHo, an orphan who migrates to Seoul with two pennies in his pocket and two mementos given to him by his dying father: a silver ring and a silver cigarette case. He survives by joining a gang.\u2022 Kim HanChol, a desperately poor rickshaw driver who is trying to better himself against almost insurmountable odds.This is a profound and haunting novel that is exquisitely written and cleverly uses the seemingly unimportant lives of the characters to tell the bigger story of history and politics. Just know that when you start this novel, it will probably take a while to really get into it.",

                "reviewText": "Are there no editors anymore? This is a good story with well-drawn characters to lead the reader through years of personal and political upheaval. The main problem, which for this reader greatly disturbs the storyline, is the lack of decisions on either the writer's or the editor's part The story begins in 1917 and 1918. From the beginning there are trite phrases and modern speech that jar and break the continuity of the story. Surely there must be a way to express joy on a wedding night without saying \"Like I wouldn't even be mad (if I died tonight). The word \"like\" used this way is modern slang. There are many examples of this kind and it's too bad because the writer's story deserved closer editorial attention.",

                "reviewText": "The best and worse of the human condition when trying to survive is brought out in this beautifully written story set in Korea during the Japanese occupation and World War II. All the women, Jade, Lotus, and Dani in particular, are strongly written although some of the men supporting the story are not as multifaceted. The characters emote so many reactions within the reader to the different situations they find themselves in such as love, hate, anger, and compassion. Much is said about the meaning of life and death and provokes much thought. The first and final chapters wrap this novel so visually in the Korean landscape and is very magical. Highly recommend this novel to anyone who loves complex characters that face a reckoning in life and their choices will determine their life\u2019s journey. The actual historical significance gives it context.",

What a full, fascinating story! Ms. Kim has given life to nearly a dozen different characters, and despite my unfamiliarity with Korean and Japanese, I had no trouble keeping people straight. Her inclusion of both positive and negative traits within one character is wonderful. It gave me a lot to sit with, particularly given all the political turmoil going on in the world today. Ms. Kim really shines in subtly showing the ongoing influence from how we are raised, and including the points of view of different characters is fascinating. By the time the story comes to a close there\u2019s no doubt that the tiger isn\u2019t the only beast.",

On one level, it's a history lesson about Korea from the first part of the 20th century, but done in such a way that it makes history come alive. On another level, it's several loves stories done over a long period of time, and great insights into the Korean people. On another level, it's written so well, that it's a joy from beginning to end.I purchased a hardback of the book and intend to read it again in the future. Would recommend Beasts to anyone seeking un understanding of an important portion of Korean history from the vantage points of different people from different levels of society, and different viewpoints concerning what it means to be Korean. 5 stars, all the way.",

Un intreccio sulle cortigiane coreane, militari giapponesi, la guerra, l'amore e l'amicizia. \"Beasts of a Little Land\" \u00e8 un romanzo storico, in cui le vicende politiche e la lotta per l'indipendenza della Corea sono il cuore pulsante della trama. Juhea Kim esplora l'ideologia di una nazione occupante da un punto di vista oggettivo e a ci\u00f2 aggiunge una trama appassionante che porta alla luce la condizione delle donne coreane in questo periodo storico.Il romanzo segue le vite di una ragazza di nome Jade, venduta all'et\u00e0 di dieci anni come apprendista a una cortigiana, e JungHo, un ragazzo povero che fa amicizia con lei. La storia, che inizia nel 1917 e termina nel 1965, si svolge sullo sfondo di un tumultuoso secolo di occupazione, fame e sconvolgimenti politici mentre i coreani bramano l'indipendenza. Lungo la strada incontriamo una vasta gamma di personaggi, tra cui ufficiali militari giapponesi, cortigiane famose, rivoluzionari comunisti e tigri.La storia di Jade \u00e8 una storia di forza e sopravvivenza. La vita di JungHo \u00e8 altrettanto difficile mentre si trasforma da piccolo criminale in rivoluzionario.Dalle stanze profumate di una scuola di Pyongyang ai caff\u00e8 glamour di una Seul in via di modernizzazione e alle foreste della Manciuria, dove infuria la guerra, gli incredibili personaggi di Juhea Kim forgiano il proprio destino mentre scommettono su quello della propria nazione. Coinvolgente ed elegante, \"Beasts of a Little Land\" svela un mondo in cui gli amici diventano nemici, i nemici diventano salvatori, gli eroi vengono perseguitati e le bestie assumono molte forme diverse.In conclusione, un romanzo travolgente in cui un incontro casuale tra un cacciatore coreano e un membro delle forze militari giapponesi dar\u00e0 il via a una catena di eventi lunga cinquant'anni.",
