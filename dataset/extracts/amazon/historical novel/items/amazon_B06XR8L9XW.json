        "description": "Based on the experience of real-life Auschwitz prisoner Dita Kraus, this is the incredible story of a girl who risked her life to keep the magic of books alive during the Holocaust.Fourteen-year-old Dita is one of the many imprisoned by the Nazis at Auschwitz. Taken, along with her mother and father, from the Terez\u00edn ghetto in Prague, Dita is adjusting to the constant terror that is life in the camp. When Jewish leader Freddy Hirsch asks Dita to take charge of the eight precious volumes the prisoners have managed to sneak past the guards, she agrees. And so Dita becomes the librarian of Auschwitz. Out of one of the darkest chapters of human history comes this extraordinary story of courage and hope.This title has Common Core connections.Godwin Books Read more",

                "reviewText": "First book of 2018!!! And why I decided to pick a book that would pull my heart out of my chest and stomp on it, I\u2019ll never know! I got this book for Christmas and I couldn\u2019t wait to pick it up. The cover is gorgeous, its based on a true story, and its all about books. As much as I\u2019ve studied the Holocaust and Auschwitz, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read about the family camp or the children\u2019s school. To be honest, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve read an account of day to day life in Auschwitz, other than the constant stream into the gas chambers. This book does a great job of capturing the feelings of the prisoners. In other accounts, it seems that all you can feel is the fear and despair. But in The Librarian, there\u2019s a sense of hope that never seems to be extinguished. Dr. Mengele could easily fit in as the villain in any horror story and be completely believable and terror-inducing. Yet Dita refuses to be cowed. Fredy, instead of looking out for his own interests and well-being like most leaders of that time did, successfully ran a school for hundreds of kids, in the middle of the most deadly extermination camp the Nazis ever set up! How our youth of today manage to \u201csurvive\u201d in this world of mean, offensive people, I\u2019ll never know! *cough*sarcasm*cough* There were so many feelings in this book! I was inspired, heartbroken, excited, scared, frustrated, angry . . . I thought I was going to burst. This is another fiction book that reads like non-fiction. Iturbe researched extensively and spent a lot of time with Dita before writing. The Postscript was actually my favorite part of the whole book because it was wonderful to hear about what kind of person Dita grew up to be. Pretty sure she is my new hero and will remain in that position forever! I would save this for slightly older teens, keep it in high school classrooms and libraries. But every single high school history teacher should have this book on their shelves. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, history, or just an inspiring story. I would also suggest that every single high schooler read this book. An easy 5 stars! \u201cBooks are extremely dangerous; they make people think.\u201d",

Excellent, deeply felt writing featuring historical characters brought to life with imaginative authenticity.On threat of immediate death, Dita, the 15 year old keeper of a handful of ratty books lends, maintains and hides forbidden volumes from Nazi eyes for the benefit of children and their teachers. Many will die and a few will survive. In the meantime, a small group of individuals determine to use the few tools theyhave to enrich the daily lives of their charges. The Librarian of Auschwitz is well worth the time it takes to read it.",

                "reviewTitle": "Courage and dedication among the horrors of Auschwitz",
                "reviewText": "WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS.This novel is closely based on a true story, told to Iturbe by the librarian herself when she was 80 years old. The people in the book appear under their real names: the only changes Iturbe has made is in the surnames of the librarian and of her future husband.Block 31 at Auschwitz-Birkenau was for children, and was part of a family camp which was used by the SS as a showcase of happy children when Red Cross officials came to the camp. Alfred Hirsch, in his twenties, whose back story is also told, was in charge of the block as its senior (Block\u00e4ltester) and was assisted by a Professor Morgenstern and several other assistants. They were supposed to keep the children disciplined and \u201centertained\u201d while their parents were involved in slave labour. Hirsch enthused them about Zionism; he trained them in sport; and he also got them to perform plays which were performed in front of the SS. But giving them any kind of education was strictly prohibited.However, Hirsch had managed to acquire a tiny library of just eight books, some of them incomplete or damaged \u2013 an atlas, a geometry treatise, H.G.Wells\u2019 \u201cHistory of the World\u201d, a Russian grammar, a Russian novel, Dumas\u2019 \u201cThe Count of Monte Cristo\u201d, a book by Freud, and Hasek\u2019s \u201cThe Good Soldier Svejk\u201d. Hirsch and his assistants used them as teaching material; and some of the assistants also knew stories (there are six such \u201cliving books)\u201d with which they captivated the children. One of these assistants is Ota Kraus, who will one day be Dita\u2019s husband.Hirsch had appointed the Czech fourteen-year-old Dita Adler as the \u201clibrarian\u201d: she was to transport these books, two at a time, in an inside pocket sewn specially by an inmate, from their secret hiding place in Hirsch\u2019s hut to the teachers. Every now and again, the Gestapo mounted an inspection. If the books were discovered, it would mean death for her; but the Gestapo did not discover them. However, the sinister Dr Mengele was always around the camp and warned Dita that he was keeping an eye on her, and, that if she stepped out line, she would be the next victim of his grisly experiments. Dita, though scared, was not deterred: she regarded her librarianship as her sacred duty, cherished the books, and carefully repaired what damage could be repaired.Every three months a new batch of prisoners arrive in Auschwitz. To make room for them, those who have been there for six months are moved on to a quarantine camp, BIIa, and from there for \u201cspecial treatment\u201d. When the time comes, Hirsch is among the 3,800 September arrivals who were moved, while Dita was in the December batch that was staying.There is in the camp a resistance movement led by one David Schmulewski, assisted by Rudi Rosenberg, whom the Nazis had made registrar to keep an ever fluctuating list of prisoners. The resistance was made up of several competing groups: communists, social democrats, Zionists, anti-Zionists and Czech nationalists. The group in the quarantine camp know they need to rise up before they are moved on; but there is only one man whom they all respect: Hirsch. Rudi urges Hirsch to give the signal for revolt; but Hirsch knows that in any uprising, the children will be at greatest risk. On March 8th, he died, apparently by suicide, but more probably because he was given an overdose of luminal by a doctor who feared the result of an uprising. There is no revolt, and the next day most of the September group were gassed.Dita cannot understand why Hirsch, who had always told them to fight to the end, should have committed suicide. Hirsch\u2019s successor as Block\u00e4ltester was Seppl Lichtenstein.He has to tell them one day that Block 31 was to be evacuated by the following day, July 11th, 1944. They appear, naked, before Dr Mengele, who sends those selected for gassing to the left, and who are spared for labour to the right. Dita has been told to go to the right. Her mother has been told to go to the left; but the Germans don\u2019t notice that, instead, she joins the group on the right. In May 1944, the group on the right is sent to a factories in Hamburg, and then, in March 1945, to Bergen-Belsen. It is not an extermination camp, but has its own horrors \u2013 brutalities, starvation, disease, and corpses which survivors have to drag to pits - all graphically described. And then, on April 15th, 1945, the camp is liberated by British troops. Tragically, Dita\u2019s mother dies of disease two months later. When the war is over, she is sent to Prague, to a hostel for the repatriated. There she met Ota Kraus again, and they married. In 1949, after the Communist take-over, they emigrated to Israel, where they became teachers, parents and grandparents. \u2026A substantial part of the book is about Dita\u2019s memories of the pre-Nazi period, then of its early days, then of the family moving, first to Terezin in November 1942 and then, in December 1943, to Auschwitz with all its horrors; also about her contacts with her always stoical mother and, until his death, her beloved father.There is also the tense story of the escape in April 1944 from Auschwitz of Rudi Rosenberg (a.k.a. Rudolf Vrba) and Fred Wetzler. When they arrived in Slovakia, they sent out a detailed account of Auschwitz. It was the first account to reach the outside world, but it was ignored for a long time. Another story is about an SS officer, Viktor Pestek, who was sickened by the Holocaust and who has fallen in love with an inmate, Ren\u00e9e Neumann and who planned for the two of them and Ren\u00e9e\u2019s mother to escape from the camp.",

The author did a stellar job of humanizing the characters and giving insight into how people reacted to their horrifying hellish reality. I especially appreciated that the author gave bonus material at the conclusion...sharing what happened to the Nazi, Jewish and other main characters after the end of the war as well as how he met some of them and researched this book. Thank you for writing so clearly and compassionately.",
