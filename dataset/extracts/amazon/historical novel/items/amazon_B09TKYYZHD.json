                "reviewText": "I always wait with great anticipation for an Eloisa James novel. And lately, they have been a breath of fresh air as much for what they are not, as for what they are. They are excellently written and beautifully edited. I don\u2019t have to stop and try to parse misstated meanings or malaligned metaphors, or words that clearly do not mean what the authors think they mean. It is so easy on my English Lit majors mind to be able to just sink into a delightful world of the author\u2019s creation and not be rudely jerked out of it periodically. And the historical accuracy is such that one feels at home in the setting. The details are exquisite without encumbering the story. And all this doesn\u2019t even address the content of the story. I love that the author digs deep for her characterizations, not merely skimming the surface, and invests one into the characters. Yasmin and the Earl have a palpable attraction and seeing them learn about each other and themselves, exposing their strengths and flaws, and watching them grow as characters throughout as they navigate their society is a pleasure and a delight.",

                "reviewText": "Raised in the French court, Lady Yasmin Regnier is no stranger to gossip, after all, her own mother was Napoleon\u2019s mistress and Yasmin herself was duped by a fortune hunter at the tender age of 16. She learned to hold her head high and ignore the whispers, but when it became too much to bear, she left France and went to live with her English grandfather, the Duke of Portbellow. While the whispers followed her to England, her connections and her beauty ensure that she is not lacking invitations or suitors. But not every man falls at her feet and unfortunately for her that includes the only man who has really piqued her interest, the grumpy Earl of Lilford, who clearly doesn\u2019t approve of her, yet always requests the first waltz, then barely speaks to her as they dance, and then ignores her after they finish. She wonders what it is about the earl that intrigues her so and what will she have to do to make him smile.Giles Renwick, the Earl of Lilford hates that he is attracted to Lady Yasmin, she is completely wrong for him, but she makes him burn in a way that no woman ever has. He allows himself only one dance with her but seethes watching the other men dance and flirt with her, all the while telling himself that she could never be his countess. After the scandals created by his parents, Giles sets himself to a higher standard and would never do anything to tarnish his family name or endanger his younger sister\u2019s reputation. And though she is beautiful, connected, and rich, Lady Yasmin\u2019s reputation and manner are all wrong for him, not to mention his sister, Lady Lydia, clearly despises her and has repeatedly warned Giles to stay away from her. But even knowing all that, Giles can\u2019t seem to walk away and soon finds himself trying to convince a reluctant Yasmin to marry him.As always, Eloisa James delivers another well-written, nicely-paced story populated by wonderful characters. After reading the reviews for this title, I really didn\u2019t expect to like it, but personally, I didn\u2019t find Giles as nasty as he was portrayed in the reviews, that is not to say he wasn\u2019t a first-class jerk to Yasmin, but neither was he the anti-hero I was expecting. Yes, he was condescending. Yes, he was rude and insulting at times. Yes, he allowed himself to be manipulated by his vile sister. But he does see the error of his ways and while he didn\u2019t really grovel, he does apologize. So while it was not perfect, this story kept me turning pages and was filled with emotion, steamyish love scenes \u2013 that don\u2019t all end with a satisfied heroine LOL, great secondary characters, a bit of drama, and finally a HEA with TWO epilogues. In the end, I enjoyed the story, but I was left wishing there had been a bit more follow-up with his sister and I am keeping my fingers crossed for a HEA for Silvester, the Duke of Huntington. This is the second book in the series and has ties to \u201cThe American Duchess\u201d, but it can absolutely be read as a standalone title.",

                "reviewText": "FINAL DECISION: I enjoyed this book because Yasmin is so resilient, and I loved how she stands up for herself despite the approbation of society and even Giles at times. I loved how Giles's love for Yasmin transforms him and how he struggles with his societal expectations. This book manages to be sweet and hot at the same time.THE STORY: Giles Renwick, Earl of Lilford, is undone by Lady Yasmin R\u00e9gnier. Yasmin is everything he could want in a wife, except that her dress and her behavior, and her history are not what he sees as proper. That makes her ineligible for consideration as his countess, but he can't stop wanting to spend time with her. Yasmin has a past and is determined to be strong in the face of the disapproval of British society and Giles. Giles is too stuffy and judgemental, yet Yasmin finds that Giles constantly exceeds her expectations.OPINION: This book is so much more serious than the initial setup appeared to portend. Yasmin and Giles have to learn to speak to one another about their fears and dreams. There was so much I loved about this book, but I really couldn't stand Gile's sister, who just drove me crazy for the entire book. I understand that she is hurting as well, but being hurt doesn't give one the privilege of hurting others.Despite this, however, I really did love the characters as they worked out their relationship with one another. There was something incredibly romantic about how Giles is completely undone by Yasmin and realizes that he has to change to have what he wants. He begins so judgmental but realizes that he is wrong. So rarely does a hero contemplate his own actions and realize that he was wrong without having an extremely dramatic situation. I ended up loving Giles because he is willing to change to be worthy of Yasmin. Those changes are about mindset and attitude and about his judgments rather than something external to himself. While the reader understands why Giles is the way he is, it is understanding rather than justification.I really loved Yasmin, who has taken the roughest part of life and made something sparkling and joyful for herself. That is why Giles falls for her and why I like her as well. So much in life could have struck her down and destroyed her, and yet she remains positive about so much.I think I really have a thing for the grumpy hero and the ray of sunshine. This book has some of that and yet upends all expectations of that trope. Giles is not as grumpy and reserved as he appears, and Yasmin has depth and real pain in her life.WORTH MENTIONING: I can't wait to read Silvester's book. He is adorable in this one.CONNECTED BOOKS: THE RELUCTANT COUNTESS is the second book in the Would-Be Wallflowers series. The romance here is self-contained, and there is no overarching storyline, so that this book can be read as a standalone. There are appearances, however, by characters from the series.STAR RATING: I give this book 4 stars.",

The first few chapters were interesting, but too soon Yasmin\u2019s backbone and self respect plunged to the depths. The trope of enemies to lovers has been played out too many times now and I feel Eloisa is becoming as bored of her books as I am. I couldn\u2019t finish the first of this series, the heroine annoyed me too much, but I had hopes that had been a one off and this seemed like it was back on form. I was wrong. Yasmin was a weak as watered water, and the duke, with his magical member and muscled thighs was no different to any of her other ducal heroes. I am fast running out of go to Georgian and regency authors, and I can practically recite my Georgette Heyers. All I want for Christmas is an intelligent regency romance.",
