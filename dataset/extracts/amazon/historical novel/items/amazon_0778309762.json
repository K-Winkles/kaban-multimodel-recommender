                "reviewText": "On the positive side, this is an excellent first novel by author Ana Johns. It is the kind of novel that you want to stay up and keep reading to find out what happens next. The story definitely holds your interest. As I am a frequent traveler to Japan, with a strong interest in Japanese literature, culture and history, I thought she did well in generally describing Japanese culture.On the negative side, I thought some of the episodes were unrealistic, but after all, this is a novel, so that can be expected, just like in Hollywood. My major criticism is that it became political, describing tragic events thattook place over 70 years ago, which were cruel but certainly not mainstream. I felt that the book paints the Japanese with an undeserved broad brush for the acts of a very few evildoers many years ago. We Americans certainly aren't perfect, as recent events have highlighted.That said, if you want very serious reading that is generally well-written , I do recommend this book.",

Her family is pressuring her to marry a Japanese boy from a good family, but she and her sailor are quite committed. And she becomes pregnant.Everything about this is sad. Japan has less tolerance for mixing races than any other country, even now, but at this time neither country would help them become legally married or help the bride to emigrate. It turns out there were thousands of women in the same position, just as in Vietnam, and it is the children who suffer.The book tells the story of the Japanese girl simultaneously telling the story of an American journalist who, upon the death of her father, learns he may have had a Japanese wife and daughter that he abandoned in Japan. The rest of the book weaves those two stories together.And breaks your heart.",

                "reviewText": "I just finished this novel, and it will stay with me for a very long time. There are so many periods of history we never think about or encounter. There are so many stories to be told. I could not stop listening to this book, and I wished I had been reading it instead of listening to it. There are so many lyrical passages in the very sad story of the two main characters. There are parts of the story I need to research, and that is always (for me) the sign of a wonderful book pointing me in a direction. My only criticism is that we learn so little about Tory, the daughter. I wanted to know more about her. I hope if you read this book, you will find it as powerful as I did. We all read through our own lenses, of course, so not everyone will love this book as much as I did. I think the author did a fabulous job of including eastern spiritual values. I will be recommending this book to friends!",

                "reviewText": "There is no way I was able to keep from comparing the prejudices toward another culture or race addressed in this book with current situations within this country. There are two women telling their stories, one in the Japan of the 50's and one of current time. I was greatly impressed how beautifully their stories, their times, melded together like the perfection of a deck of cards being shuffled. As always, I find that any book that uses a second language should contain a glossary; if not for that failure, I would have given 5 stars.",

The segment is quite graphic and detailed, and goes on and on, showing only a slight relevance to the eventual story. To me the whole section is gratuitous, could have been omitted, unless someone enjoys reading details about an old man's dying of cancer. The necessary information, revealing a mysterious letter and a few photos, could have been given in a couple of paragraphs, or pages if to be lengthy. When the actual story starts to develop, it pulled me in. I don't know about the accuracy of Japanese or of the cultural background., but the development of the relationships of the Japanese woman, her American military lover, the culture, and the man's daughter kept me engrossed, so ultimately the book was worth reading.",

But her traditional family and in particular her authoritative father have other plans for her to marry a young man of their choosing. The American is unacceptable, and children of mix race are also not welcome in Japan.I do not wish to ruin any part of the masterful plot of this beautifully written book. I was riveted to this story from start to finish. I could not put the book down for very long as I needed to know what would happen to each of the characters. I was not disappointed and my guess is that you won't be either. Madame Butterfly, crossed my mind more than once but the plot is totally different.",
