                "reviewText": "The premise of the book focuses on the hero and heroine who want to avoid marriage, one arranged by her father, and the other, relentless pressure from his mother. They agree to pretend to court to avoid their family\u2019s pressures and expectations, but agree they must follow the rule of never falling love. Joanna and Kenneth are both carrying heavy emotional burdens that prevent them from opening their hearts. I am a big fan of this author, and once again I was not disappointed. She takes a fake courtship, weaves in a great supporting cast, crafting a few with nefarious intentions, all in an effort to add in drama. In addition, there is another side story that brings a mystery into the plot. She slowly releases hints and clues teasing the reader with knowledge that something more dramatic was soon to occur. I enjoy the build-ups. This is a great read. I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

I found Joanna to be a believably character and watched her grow. Finally and more importantly is the fact that this is the first book in a very long time that had no errors. Hanna is my favorite author but the editing has been very poor. Not her fault , but frustrating still. The story was full and clean and gave me faith in her again.",
