A woman who stepped into the world of men, navigating her way through a closely strewn minefield of political, social and familial relationships that changed frequently, except for the latter. \u201cWitty and often cynically pragmatic\u201d we are told in Penrose\u2019s excellent Author\u2019s Note.Her time as her beloved uncle, William Pitt\u2019s hostess at Walker Castle and later, when Pitt formed government, as Pitt\u2019s \u2018Private Secretary\u2019 gave her the chance to blossom, as she served as his sounding board and confidant for various political actions.She was a close acquaintance of Brummell. She and her cousin the wildly unpredictable Lord Camelford sparked off each other, a tempestuous relationship. Her relations with Lord Granville Leveson Gower, later Ambassador to Russia left her damaged. With Lieutenant-General John Moore however, she was able to be herself. She was shattered by the tidings of his death during the retreat of the British at Corunna.Still she walked on with life, wounded but determined. Remembering John\u2019s words, \u201cIt was the journey that mattered\u201d and \u201cFortune favors the bold.\u201dThis fictionalised biography of Hetty\u2019s life until she left Portsmouth with her brother James, whilst he recuperated before returning for duty at Gibraltar, really touched me. A woman fighting her times. Hetty journeyed on to the Middle East, to the Levant, an explorer, archaeologist and adventurer. Never to return to England. Her story had me transfixed in the end. Her pain, her courage, all extraordinary.A Kensington ARC via NetGalley.Many thanks to the author and publisher.Please note: Quotes taken from an advanced reading copy maybe subject to change(Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.)",

                "reviewText": "Andrea Penrose, Author or \u201cThe Diamond of London\u201d has written an intriguing novel. The Genres for this novel are Historical Fiction, Regency Era Romance, and Fictional Biography. The Author writes about Lady Hester Stanhope, and her desire for adventure, being a non-conformist of the times, and independent in her political views. Lady Hester \u2019s family line was filled with politicians, and war heroes. Lady Hester\u2019s father was eccentric and quirky, and neglected his children. Her Uncle, William Pitt, the younger helps provide stability and encouragement for his niece.These were times when men held positions of importance, and expectations of ladies were limited and solid. Yet, Lady Hester didn\u2019t appreciate that women weren\u2019t treated equally. With the background setting of war, Lady Hester became a hostess in her Uncle\u2019s home. She was controversial for the times, being outspoken, opinionated, and adventurous. For example, she could ride horses better than most men. Lady Hester liked challenges.When it came to love, and adventures of the heart, Lady Hester was unconventional for the times, but was emotionally fragile, and hurt.At times, this is a slow paced novel, and I would have liked to read more of Lady Hester\u2019s adventures in England, and abroad. There are many characters, and it does get confusing. I did learn about Lady Hester and would like to learn more about her and the time that she lived.",

                "reviewText": "1800Lady Hester Stanhope is one of 6 children and takes on the responsibility of keeping her radical father under control. He is totally wrapped up in his scientific experiments and spends a lot of money on them. She lost her mother when she was just 3. Her father remarried and she now has 3 younger brothers. However, her stepmother is bored being ignored by her husband and chooses to live in London leaving her sons in the terrible care of their father.Hester\u2019s uncle, William Pitt, is the Prime Minister which opens doors for her to connect with society. A friend, George (Beau) Brummell, the fashion trendsetter schools her in being more assertive. It\u2019s when she meets a cousin that she wants to experience things that are usually closed to a lady. Although he a wealthy man, he has a checked past and temper that does not bode well for her friendship with him.Soon, Hester starts working with her uncle and becomes a huge help to him in his works and also with socializing with many of the politicians he deals with. Her keen interest in politics and engaging way makes her a huge plus.The men she fell in love with all differed, but sadly, she never had a solid love in her life. She ever tired of learning and was a very intelligent woman.This was an intriguing story about a woman with whom I was not familiar. I was very impressed with the author\u2019s extensive research into this woman\u2019s life and the people she knew. Very well written and informative. Enjoy.I voluntarily reviewed an Advanced Reader Copy of this book.",

                "reviewText": "Thank you NetGalley for this ARC. 3.5 starsI was intrigued by the premise of this historical fiction novel. I had heard of Lady Hester but only in passing. What a character! Coming from a tragic childhood but stemming from a family of strong unique personalities, Hester is determined to live life on her terms\u2026 which as a titled woman in Regency London isn\u2019t easy. We ride the waves of her romantic entanglements and watch as she figures out what\u2019s truly important.The story held my interest and is very well-researched. I love books about little-known strong female characters from history. I think the book could benefit from a tighter editing - lots of the same descriptors used repeatedly and the war talk/strategy seemed to detract a bit from the overall arc of the story.An enjoyable book recommended for historical fiction fans.",
