Although my experience was much different than Kassandra's, the book still brought back some wondeerful memories of Greece. We were privileged to walk past the Acropolis daily. It was especially stunniing in the evening. I always learn a lot of history reading Alison's books. She does much research and I have no doubt that it is accurate. I also loved the author's notes at the end of the book. They were very helpful to me.",

                "reviewText": "Kassandra is the illegitimate daughter of an Athenian noble and a hetaera. When Kassandra is ten years old, her father arranges a marriage for her. In order to avoid the arranged marriage, her mother takes her to the mountains to find the Amazons. Kassandra trains and becomes an Amazonian. Throughout her journey with the Amazons, Kassandra is repeatedly tested through a series of trials and even finds love along the way.Kassandra is a very strong character. She has a harsh upbringing and goes through many trials. Yet, she is very resilient and determined. Her persistence leads to overcome her hardships. I also find Kassandra to be very kind and merciful. She is very loving and cares for the people around her! Therefore, Kassandra is a very admirable and compelling character. I was deeply invested in her story and wanted to know what happened to her.Overall, Kassandra: A Tale of Love, War, and One Woman\u2019s Destiny was a deeply moving coming-of-age story. Some of the characters, especially her love interest, were very one-dimensional. Nevertheless, I found Kassandra\u2019s bond with her mother to be the best aspect of the novel. I like how Kassandra: A Tale of Love, War, and One Woman\u2019s Destiny moved at a very fast-pace. There was never a dull moment in the novel, and I found myself reading it in one sitting! I like how the novel incorporates Greek mythology with Greek history! This was a very meticulously researched story that is filled with vivid imagery! I felt that I was walking alongside Kassandra in Ancient Greece! I recommend this novel for fans of Penelope Haines, Amalia Carosella, and Claire M. Andrews!(Note: I received an ARC copy of the novel from the author. All opinions are my own.)",

Kassandra is a heroine like none I've ever known. She is an Amazonian warrior, one with a pure heart, an uncommon strength and a great capacity for love. This story taught me a lot about the history of ancient Greece. It also brought to life one more role that strong women have played in the history of the world. In Kassandra, we see a woman who is physically strong and able, but one who has heart and spirit. Thank you, Alison for bringing Kassandra into our reading rooms!",

                "reviewText": "Kassandra, the story of a Greek girl, starts in 440 B.C. and tells of life in those times. Women were not allowed many freedoms and their lives were serving the men in the family. Kassandra was born to a hetaera of a prominent Athenian man who contracted her to marriage at an early age. Her mother secreted her away from Athens and started her on a journey to Zeus' mountain, the home of the Amazon's. Read the riveting tale of life and times in the ancient Greece that is nothing like your high school and college history classes.",

                "reviewText": "This novel really helped me better to understand the great characters from Greek Mythology with how the author wound them into the storyline. Kassandra's future was decided the day she was born in the fourth century BC, but her mother doesn't want her to go down that path and knows Kassandra is destined for a greater life. A greater life than she could ever give her. Sending her on a journey and to lands only dreamed of, Kassandra is already being tested by the gods and this is only the beginning of proving herself and her worth to herself and those who believe in her, and her path. There was so much to this storyline and I loved it all. There was history, romance, battles, family and a woman changing the perceptions of who and what they should be. Thank you to the author for her generosity of the free autographed novel, this will go on the shelf with her other novels. This review is of my own opinion and accord.",
