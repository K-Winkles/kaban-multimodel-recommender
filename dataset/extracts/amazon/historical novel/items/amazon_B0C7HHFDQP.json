                "reviewText": "\"When the World Goes Quiet\" is a touching work of artistry. It was not lost on me that the underlying theme of our leading lady Evelien's love of and appreciation for fine art were mirrored in Sardar's brilliantly colorful description of every detail in this book. Her ability to paint a mental picture with her words is simply unmatched. A true master of the metaphor. I have been a fan of Ms. Sardar's writing for a long time and was eagerly anticipating this release. It was worth the wait.This book is at once a heartbreaking story of war, loss and hardship, love, hope and strength. In Evelien's commitment to discovering the whereabouts of her husband, Emiel, the reader feels a desperate hope. In Evelien's curiosity about her friendship with the enemy soldier, the reader sees an innocence in her and feels a spark of forbidden love that is both unnerving and exciting. When I sat with them in their abandoned garden, walls full of art and contraband vegetables, I couldn't help but catch my breath with the hope that they could both find a spark of joy in each other during the bloodiest, most tragic time in our recent history.It is impossible to read this story and not fall in love with Evelien's quirks and her feisty spirit. During a time where women were expected not to have a voice, it is inspiring to read a strong woman who is smart enough to take on an enormously dangerous mission and quietly and brilliantly succeed, all while protecting her family, fighting her demons, working in the most hostile of environments and living through terrorizing war.\"When the World Goes Quiet\" is truly one of the few books that makes me jealous of the \"me\" I was before I finished it because she would get to read it again for the first time, through inevitable tears. I am obsessed.",

There was some excessive detail at times that I skimmed over without losing the gist of the story. It has a historical background that is interesting, a grounding in art, and great characters. The impact of war on human behavior is an important element and theme. I\u2019m now glad I stuck with it.",

                "reviewText": "There are many books out there about the world wars, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read one like this. It\u2019s different in so many ways, from the fact that it takes place in just the last bit of the war to a character who is discovering herself as an artist in the midst of everything and a painting that gives her hope. As a painter myself, I appreciated this look into an artist\u2019s mind as she processes and survives such a traumatic time. But even someone who has no interest in art would love this book because it\u2019s filled with suspense and intrigue and has an incredible love story. As others have said, the characters are real and flawed and that\u2019s why I loved them. The ending is also perfect and I don\u2019t know what else to say other than it\u2019s an amazingly beautiful and well-written book that I highly recommend.",

Although there is great tragedy laced into this novel, the story also depicts true strength, bravery, loyalty, and love. The way that the author created connection through art and artistry was lovely. I was nervous about the ending, because I was really invested in the outcome - thankfully, my fears were unwarranted. For a book that details such a dark period in history, there was hope laced throughout - and it was only fitting that it end on that note. I enjoyed this novel from beginning to end. I look forward to reading more by this author.",

I didn\u2019t like her mother in law for asking her to sacrifice her life just so she could get a letter from her son. I didn\u2019t like her employer as I felt he was cruel to her. I loved the German soldier that she met on the sly. But then when all the truths came out my opinions turned out to be far from how I depicted them. And wow, talk about plot twists that shock you to your core. The lengths people go to protect others.Highly recommend.",

It is haunting but hopeful while keeping you on edge the entire time. There are no characters that are either purely evil or purely good which gives the story a rawness and heartbreaking quality given the history of the war. It was gripping to read a war story where the characters are on the cusp of being on the other side of it, but still in constant danger of losing everything. This was a page turner until the very end!",

Yes, WWI is the backdrop for book, but it is so multi layered and poignant that it would be a shame to relegate it to the shelf of any genre. I was so consumed that it didn\u2019t feel like reading at all, more like I was transported to a physical place where I could actually see and feel the story unfurling around me.The author\u2019s ability to captivate my imagination with her craft was a feast for my soul and I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on the rest of her work.",

A good war story and mixed with a beautiful love story that was so moving I found it difficult to put the book down to make a cup of tea and read in one day . I recommend this book to anyone who loves historical fiction and who loves a good romance , well worth the price .",
