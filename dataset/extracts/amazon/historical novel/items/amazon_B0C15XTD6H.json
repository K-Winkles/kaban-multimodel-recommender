But Kate is both talented and daring, recklessly going wherever the story might be\u2014including, one October day, to an anti-fascism protest in East London. There, she meets David Rabatkin, a brilliant Jewish medical student. While his idealistic brother is eager to go to Spain and join the fight for the Republic, David knows where his path lies: at home, fulfilling the expectations of his profession and his family. Kate is exposed for the first time to the dangers and demands of David\u2019s world, where marrying within the Jewish faith is seen as not only preferable, but key to survival. Kate neither expects nor wants to be any man\u2019s wife, hampered by convention. And though she and David are both outsiders, as war looms, other differences between them are thrown into sharp relief.Brighton, 1940: Catastrophe forces Kate to flee London and the onslaught of war finds her working at her sister\u2019s seaside boarding house, while David tends patients at a busy London hospital as the Blitz rages. But Kate\u2019s challenges and disappointments have only deepened her desire to capture images of life unfurling around her, the beauty and violence, struggles and surprising joys. And soon fate and ambition will align, providing her with the chance to make her mark at last . . .",

She crosses paths with David Rabatkin in East London at an anti-fascist protest. Kate is there to get a great photo; David is coming from the hospital, where he is a medical student, to meet his brother.The two were not looking for love; both were ambitious and had careers ahead of them. Even more of an obstacle: Kate is Irish Catholic, while David is Jewish.This is undoubtedly an emotional and complicated love story during a turbulent time. I enjoyed that Kate is a strong-willed woman, and the descriptions of her work are fascinating.Although not surprising, it\u2019s always heartbreaking to see how much racism, antisemitism, and division always existed everywhere, no matter what was going on in the world.",
