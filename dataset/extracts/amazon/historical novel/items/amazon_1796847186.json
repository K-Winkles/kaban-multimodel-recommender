                "reviewText": "Alison Blasdell compiled fiction and fact that is totally engaging in THE CONFEDERATES' PHYSICIAN about a very young woman with a very strong will who is determined not only to be a physician, but to be one for the Union army during the Civil War! Events turn drastically, however, when she is captured by Confederate soldiers and forced to be a surgeon for them. How in the world could that happen you ask? She is also a master of disguise, appearing to be a young boy. Some readers have faulted the author for the fifteen-year-old age of the female protagonist, but in 1860s America, she was more than \"of age,\" and the romantic relationship that ensues was not out of the ordinary for the times. Personally however, I would have found the whole story more palatable and believable had she been a few years older, at least, but that did not keep me from enjoying it. We are warned in the synopsis of \"adult content,\" and that is very correct. The violence of war is just realistic and understandable; the bedroom activity was a little more graphic than I needed, but not outrageous. I was disappointed that the author used the name Belle for the madam; that just overtly added to the GWTWind flashbacks. But all in all, I really enjoyed all of the story and liked how it unfolded. I loved the interspersed Indian background and input into the character's persona. Samantha's horse Kota was marvelous. It's a really good novel about the horrors of the war that deeply effected both sides of the American people.",

The author does an excellent job of explaining why southerners withdrew from the Union and fought the Federal troops who, in their view, invaded their lands destroying their crops and homes. As she correctly pointed out, most southerners did not own slaves and were not fighting to preserve slavery.",

Her aunt never realized what she had done. After 2 years she came back to her very angry father in the Northwestern Iowa Frontier but decided she wanted to work in the Union Medical Corps so disguising herself as a boy again she ran away and headed east. She never got to the Union lines as she was picked up by the confederates and once they found out she was a surgeon they kept her. It is a story of love, loss and terrible fighting during the Civil War. I thought it was a wonderful story.",

Until outside people took over our city and decided we should erase all of our historical markers, it was a huge part of our city. They even dug up APHills grave to remove his statue. It\u2019s a shame that the people of today don\u2019t know the truth about why this war was fought. Slavery was only a part of their reasons. Plus, the North had slaves too, no matter how much they try to hide that. I think this book dealt with a lot of the issues of that time. It was a very interesting read. I wish someone would write a book about the Irish slaves. That is a huge part of our history too. I love history, it\u2019s important to learn from past mistakes. We need more books about historical events, since they don\u2019t teach it anymore.",

I found it relaxing and exciting to read. Loved the characters and how they were interwoven in the story to keep my attention. A girl of fifteen becomes a surgeon on the battlefield in the southern states. Now you ask, \" How is that possible?\". Guess you will have to read this book to find out! Enjoy!",

I feel uncomfortable about 15 year old women/girls being taken in intimate relationships by grown men. I know that there are cultures and communities where this is practiced even in the 21st century. I would have preferred not to read about that for my recreational literature. My other complaint is about the gory details of war and the cruelty of men. But it was such a compelling love story that I just had to accept the shortcomings that came with it. I also have a weak spot for women healers and the influence of the unseen world(spirit of Ancestors guiding the living in good deeds).Thank you Alison for this beautiful novel. Just make the next one less gruesome and make your strong female heroine a little bit older than15",
