                "reviewText": "As a Mary Balogh fan, I found this novel a little daunting at times. Gloomy perhaps. But as always her writing is superb in every way, bringing to life the interaction of a group of people, when faced with a challenging event. Something which might affect even people in today's world! Never an easy situation to face!But the introspection of the main protagonists, is written with such depth and understanding of human nature, that it is absolutely inspiring. The romance is there, as complex, and yet as simple as the problems encountered. Her description of events, and finer details of the period, make it easy to lose oneself in a different world, where emotions run deep even in the minor players. Where love between individuals emerge to support loved ones, and ultimately to heal damaged souls.I would certainly recommend this book.",

I really got to know the characters and the setting and feel like the Ware family are actually people I know. A tortured hero is always my favorite and Devlin fit the bill! I am anxiously awaiting reading about the entire family - especially Ben (sigh). Great start to what I am anticipating being a wonderful couple of years of delicious reading.",

But her themes have become stupidly and dully repetitive \u2026 as others have explained much more eloquently than I\u2026 And by the way, I take my hat off to the early excellently written reviews of this book : some of you should seriously try your hand at becoming authors yourselves!Back to \u2018Remember Love\u2019\u2026Sorry Mary but can you not find even one story without the angle of unfairly disgraced hero (or heroine) being slowly redeemed by \u2018love\u2019\u2026?The inner talk of the H and h\u2026 unutterably uninteresting\u2026 much ado about nothing. Or is this just \u2026reality\u2026?I am two thirds through this anticipated new book \u2026 and nothing but stilted conversations \u2026 suppressed grief \u2026 misguided duty\u2026 serious unreality \u2026O for the privilege to be a superlatively titled and rich gentleman \u2026 that is so utterly weighed down by nobility and burning seriousness\u2026 that he breaks apart his whole family\u2019s illusions in one furious moment, and then cannot bear even thinking of his siblings or parents for six whole years \u2026 acting the paragon of mindless soldierly integrity \u2026 All this, when his life instead, could have been extravagant enjoyment of his privileges\u2026 if only he would deign to be human \u2026Is such a man believeable? Certainly impressive in his stubborn adherence to unflinching action over feeling\u2026 but identifiable as a real person \u2026 no. I am reminded of the Shakespearian line on Romeo: \u201cWhy such a man is he, he is a man of wax..!\u201dAnd the heroine is otherworldly in her perfection - when such weighty subjects are addressed, such a paragon of virtue is\u2026 convenient?Perhaps Mary\u2019s brilliance as writer, in spite of the low entertainment value of this book, is that she convincingly shows us that outliers such as this man exist, and can be \u2026 redeemed by love \u2026?Will read on and hope it gets sunnier\ud83d\ude0a",

Then you get every excruciating detail of what must be the longest and dullest summer f\u00eate ever held. The MCs both think about the same topic multiple times.It\u2019s too easy to excuse the overuse of detail as the need to set up the series. An editor should have used the red pen a little more thoroughly on this, but I guess they don\u2019t care because they know it will sell with Ms. Balogh\u2019s name on it.I really hope book 2 is better, though I hesitated to pre-order it based on this book. If it\u2019s not better, I give up on this series. Life is too short.",

                "reviewText": "Kicking off a brand new Mary Balogh series, this heartrending and unexpectedly thought-provoking historical romance is the most gentle and soft I have read this year, even though I didn't expect it to turn out that way. I was left with that sweet feeling of contentment that can only come with the sigh you breathe with the perfect happy ending. And wow, what a set up for a series this book is.Have patience in the first act, because it is essential to understand each member of the Ware family (of Ravenswood Hall) and their relationships with one another for the climax that comes not at the end but in the second act. And what a climax. It serves as the context for the rest of this novel, and the foundation for those to follow.Mary Balogh can write a male main character like no other, and she returns to one of her (and my!) favorite male archetypes -- a returning soldier from the Napoleonic Wars.Woven throughout this mutual pining, second chance romance (yes please!) are a number of poignant and timely themes including truth, honesty, integrity, loyalty, acceptance, forgiveness, hope, and, of course, the power of love in the shaping and changing of people's lives.I can't wait for the next one, but I've got my fingers crossed for Ben or Stephanie!",

This one is no exception and it's not an exaggeration to say she is, hands down, the best regency romance author ever!!",
