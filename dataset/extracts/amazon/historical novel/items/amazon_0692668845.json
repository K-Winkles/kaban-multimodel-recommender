                "reviewText": "likelikeI like the cover of this book. It's made to look.like a dime store novel, quite charming! I love historical fiction set in the late 19th century in the West. Unfortunately, most novels set in that time period really are dime store novels; not authentic to that time period at all.I was hungering for a really good Western, one that was authentic and that I could lose myself in. I noted that the author of \"The Captured Girl\" is a history professor, and became hopeful that this is the book I was looking for.It did not disappoint! It's an excellent blend of fiction with real life historical events and people, mostly army officers. It's set during the Indian Wars, mostly in the area of Montana and Wyoming territory, though part of the story takes place in New York City.It's an action and adventure story that isn't always easy to read. In it's authenticity it gets violent and bloody. The characters don't get much rest. Children grow up fast.It is the story of strong woman, captured by Indians at age 14. She is assimilated into that culture, then returned along with her young son, to White culture. It also tells the story of a young army lieutenant, raised in wealthy society, who becomes a man in his own right as he carries out his military duties and falls in love with our heroine, the captured girl. All the characters in this book evolve and grow. It's why they will stay with me for quite some time.One of my favorite perks about reading historical fiction is that I learn so much without trying. I especially like reading on a Kindle, because I can easily fact check to separate the fiction from known history and look up words that are leaving our everyday vocabulary.This book would make a great movie or miniseries. I'm surprised it's not more well known. Something that did take away professionalism are the typos and misspellings. They weren't rampant, but they were there. Careless mistakes like different spellings of the characters names, and inaccurate capitalization, along with bad punctuation. There was only one instance where I couldn't make out what the storyteller meant, due to a typo.However, the book was so good that I easily overlooked those mistakes. I really enjoyed this author's writing and will definitely be reading more of his work!",

The adventure never stops and you really feel the excitement and anticipation of what the individuals are going through. I feel it was totally believable, having read true stories about white captives. Morgan is a real bad a...s and my new favorite western hero! This is a throw back to the old western movies I watched as a child and, in my opinion, on the same level as the John Wayne classic \"The Searchers\". I highly recommend.",

I have read a number of westerns but this is the first I've read that is by a male author. The difference between male and female writing is noticeable . I quite enjoyed this .",
