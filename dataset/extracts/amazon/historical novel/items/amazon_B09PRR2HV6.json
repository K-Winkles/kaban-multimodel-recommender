She was a very strong and confident woman and many feel that pride was her downfall. I believe, however, that she had to be the way she was because England had never been ruled by a woman and she constantly had to prove herself. Of course she never got the chance. With the constant battles it definitely was a sad time for the country. A very good read!",

She is capable of taking on a lot of responsibility as she becomes a true wife to her husband. Her brother died on the White Ship, denying England of an heir. After Matilda's husband dies, her father, King Henry, calls her home. He has all the noblemen swear homage to Matilda as his heir and Lady of the English. When her father passes away, she must fight her usurping cousin, Stephen, for the throne.I love the story line as the reader is swept away by Matilda's tale.",

                "reviewText": "I knew very little regarding the life of Matilda , King Henry II's mother until I read this fascinating book , and to my surprise, found it so absorbing that I could not put it down.Her life as the daughter of Henry I and her childhood experiences of becoming betrothed at such a young age and eventual marriage are told in harrowing detail , in times when such practises completely disregarded the rights and feelings of innocent royal females.However, her life in France with Geoffrey earned her many esteemed Titles , great wealth and three sons , but then her father died and she was persuaded to return to England to claim the throne from her cousin , Stephen , who had been crowned king in her absence .The years of war that follow is a tale of tragedy, betrayal , and great suffering, possibly due to her incredibly bad temper whichQuickly alienated those whom she needed to achieve her aim !The historical details are described in great depth , but written in such a way that kept me eagerly living every moment alongside this remarkably strong and brave woman who almost changed history.I loved every minute of it.",

                "reviewText": "A very good novel about Queen and Empress Mathilda.Henry II's mother and Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine's mother-in-law, was convinced she was the rightful Queen of England.....I found extremely interesting to read about how relative it is to inherit the title of Queen, first because she was a woman and also somebody else was on the throne!!! I also was fascinated about hard she fought towards this crown: sieges, being under siege, how to get supporters, money... All at the expense of her own children who had stayed in Normandy with their father! An excellent historical background has proved a good frame for showing us an interesting, impressive and royal child who turned into a woman no less fascinating. Good characterisation revealing Mathilda with her strengths as well as weaknesses. Highly recommended!",
