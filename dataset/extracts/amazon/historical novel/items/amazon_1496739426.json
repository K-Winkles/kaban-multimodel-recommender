This was one of the liveliest discussions we have ever had in our 12-13 years in existence. Many were so enthralled with the various persons in the book, they looked them up on line to verify the history involved and what happen was really true. Yes, there is poetic license taken by the author but that happens when you write dialog for historical persona. The book itself is well researched, well written and Shana Abe made sure you would not want to put it down. As a historical novel, it is not dry but very lively so it becomes pretty much a page turner. This book takes place over 47 yrs and yet the author made sure you did not read a tome, being able to keep the story within the time line and yet keep the book under 400 pages. Kudos to Shana!!!",

                "reviewText": "I can only start this review one way. Wow! What a story!The author begins near the end of 1902, with Lucy, a sales clerk, from The Town Topics Publishing Co. arriving to see Mrs Huntington. Lucy\u2019s employer is trying to gouge the widow of Collis P. Huntington to pay the hefty price of $10,000 for a copy of its newest publication \u201cFads and Fancies of Representative Americans at the Beginning of the Twentieth Century: being a Portrayal of their Tastes, Diversions, and Achievements.\u201d From there, the author sends the reader back to 1867 and into the life of Arabella D. Yarrington - a beautiful 17 year old- who is working as a champagne girl at one of the many illegal drinking and gambling houses that Johnny Worsham owns in Richmond. Arabella\u2019s father has died and left behind his wife and five children on the verge of starvation. Arabella\u2019s job makes the difference between their eating or starving.Arabella is not only beautiful, she is smart. She is determined. She is a planner. And she wants her family out of poverty. When she meets Collis P. Huntington, she believes she has found her way out. But only if she consistently plays her part.This well researched novel takes the reader through all the feels. Emotionally hard at times, Arabella (Belle) moves forward in her planned out life to rescue not only her mother and siblings but herself. When she needs to reinvent herself, she does just that.The story, set in The Gilded Age, takes the reader to glorious places and the opulent buildings and homes that were popular during that time. During this period of her life, Belle, with thoughtfulness and grace, faces rejection from a very judgmental society. She is judged. She is shunned. But, she perseveres in creating the life she wants for her family.This beautifully written, well researched novel is historical fiction at its best as the author tells the story of the real Arabella Yarrington and how she fought, planned, changed, and honed her skills to become the richest woman in the country.I loved this book. The author\u2019s beautifully written descriptions make the Gilded Age, and all its excess, come alive for the reader. Not only a solid five star read for me but a new author discovered! Well done, Shana Abe.",
