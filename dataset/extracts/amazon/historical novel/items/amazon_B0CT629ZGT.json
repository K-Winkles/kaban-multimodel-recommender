As she prepares to leave her home, clutching what little possessions she is allowed to carry, her thoughts meander to a simpler time before the war \u2013 and a secret name, one she rarely recites out loud, forever embedded in her heart.Present day. Devorah was never allowed to ask about her mother\u2019s repressed past, until her mother agreed to show her a hidden drawer containing her secret history. Devorah unravels the story of the amazing women who have shaped her legacy: the one who raised her mother as her own \u2013 and the one her mother never knew.Inspired by the true story of her maternal lineage, Devorah Shafrir Keret weaves a haunting, unforgettable saga of brave, broken women spanning a century of secrets and triumphs, unfaltering love and incredible loss, and the generation-spanning power of family.",

                "reviewText": "My Grandmother's Shadow is an historical novel unlike any other I've read. The author writes from the vantage point of the present and methodically peels back layer after layer of family history against the backdrop of the Holocaust. As a young child, Devorah realized that she knew nothing about her mother's family, and every time she asked questions, she came up against a brick wall. Ultimately, as she grew into adulthood, she was able to discover a past that was unlike anything she could have imagined.My Grandmother's Shadow is fact-based fiction from Devorah's decades long search. This story is intensely compelling because the truths that are revealed take the reader beyond a story line and into the emotional landscape of three generations and shifting geography. Devorah is at the heart of the story because she persists in weaving together the details that seed her most authentic identity. The characters are human and relatable, the plot takes unexpected twists and turns, and the conclusion feels more like a new beginning than an ending. I heartily recommend this book for readers who savor the wonder of life stories and their legacies.",

                "reviewText": "This book is hard to put down and very moving. I read it almost in one go. It is such a fascinating plot with an easy-to-read flow. It kept me curious, caught up, and thoroughly involved in this dramatic and sad story. The book is an incredible family saga, written from the point of view of the chain of three women of three generations of one family, inspired by the true historical story of the writer\u2019s family over generations. It\u2019s a lot about love, loss, and abonnement, about family secrets and layers of searching for truth and resolution.The book also provides an authentic glimpse into the complex and tragic life of Jewish people in Europe during World War 2, brought here so vividly to life, intertwining gently a wealth of accurate historical background. However, it is still an easy read as it gets the reader into the unique experiences, thoughts, and feelings of the three fascinating and complex women telling the story, and not put the historical tragedies and the holocaust as its focus.I truly recommend it. It is an excellent read if you enjoy historical fiction and family saga dramas.",
