It's been valuable for me to spend some time in a world even more violent and unjust than ours -- when women had even less power than we have now.

I enjoyed the nuanced portrait of Giulia and will continue the series.",

Recently I\u2019ve stumbled across women writers writing wonderful story plots around seemingly ordinary women who were real people living extraordinary lives trying to go their own way in life while making a difference to others. This series is a fantastic example.",

                "reviewText": "Guilia D'Adamo's mother is executed for creating a poison to help abused women be rid of their cruel husbands. Guilia thinks what she has done is entirely wrong, until she becomes the victim of the sadistic religious maniac Domenico Verdi - whose misuse of power and perversions are bringing Naples' closer to starvation. Guilia takes on her mother's role, knowing it will almost certainly lead to the same punishment. Author Deborah Swift's skill is giving her reader hope that Guilia will not only survive but find love and happiness. But these are dark days and Swift is writing about a real person. What makes this book so very good is the way history, especially 'women's history', and a fast-paced plot are woven together to create a compelling thriller. I couldn't put this book down until I knew what was going to happen to the heroine. Which came as surprise - but no spoilers.",
