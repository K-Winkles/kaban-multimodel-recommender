The chapters go back and forth between the two women -- Diana on the eve of her wedding to Charles, and Charlotte as a young woman resisting marriage to a foreign prince she doesn't like. Despite the ultimately sad subject matter, I found both of the stories interesting, and the writing flows well.",

                "reviewText": "When I saw there was a novel featuring Princess Diana, I was so excited! However, it didn't take long to realize the title is a bit misleading. The book was more about Princess Charlotte than Diana. I did enjoy the connection and similarities between the two. It was also interesting reading about a royal family member I knew nothing about. In that respect I enjoyed it. It's just that the title had me thinking we'd see Diana later in life (or at least more about her in general). My other quip is that writing style felt more geared toward a YA audience than an adult, which is fine but that's personally something I like to be prepared for ahead of time.I ended up enjoying Charlotte's side of the story more. My heart breaks for her, but I'm glad here her life was able to provide consolation to a young and anxious Diana as she set forth to her own life of royalty. The dynamic was very touching. I also liked the frankness of Diana's struggles and her confrontations with Charles. Mentions of Camilla were difficult, but I was glad the book ended on a positive note. Despite it not being what I expected, it was a nice read and it reawakened my interest in Princess Diana after several years.Thank you to Harper Collins and NetGalley for sending me a free copy. I am leaving this review voluntarily and I have since purchased the book for myself on Kindle.",

                "reviewTitle": "A tale of two Princesses",
                "reviewText": "\u2018The People\u2019s Princess\u2019 by Flora Harding explores through historical fiction the lives of two Princesses of Wales; one born to the royal title and the other born into the British aristocracy and married into royalty.I combined reading with its unabridged audiobook edition, narrated by Julie Teal.Buckingham Palace, 1981. Lady Diana Spencer has recently become engaged to Prince Charles. It may have seemed a dream come true but now she\u2019s finding herself bored and alone. Courtiers seek to instruct her on royal protocol but the soon-to-be Princess of Wales finds it all very stuffy and rebels. Yet she finds the centuries of tradition too intractable and is increasingly unhappy.When she comes across a portrait of Princess Charlotte of Wales, the granddaughter of George III and the only child of the Prince Regent, she finds herself drawn to the tragic princess. She is put in touch with Amelia Bell, who is working with the royal archives at Windsor Castle. Amelia lends Diana a transcript of Charlotte\u2019s personal diary.From here the novel moves between Lady Diana as she prepares for her wedding and Charlotte\u2019s diary from 1813 to her death in 1817. As Diana reads the diary, she sees many parallels with her own life and future as Princess of Wales. \u2026I had mixed feelings about this novel as while I understand that the 1981 sections were based on accounts that Diana provided to friends and biographers, she comes across as immature and needy. Perhaps those who adore her might have sympathy but for myself it just further highlighted how unsuited she and Charles were even at this early stage. They really had so little common ground.Perhaps this was Harding\u2019s intention though I also found the Diana chapters rather repetitive and felt that the chapters focusing on Princess Charlotte were more interesting; especially as I knew little about her life, including her death at such a young age.With respect to the audiobook, Julie Teal has narrated a wide range of audiobooks. Her voice is crystal clear and quite posh, perfect for the royal subject matter.In her Acknowledgements Flora Harding gives details of the sources she utilised for both timelines and stressed that as a novelist she has made her own interpretations of source material.Overall, while I found the Princess Charlotte chapters of more interest than the Lady Diana chapters I can appreciate the appeal of a novel that offers via historical fiction glimpses into these privileged lives.3.5 stars rounded up to 4.",
