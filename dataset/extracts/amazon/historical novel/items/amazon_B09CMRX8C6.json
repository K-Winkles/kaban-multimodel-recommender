Ava, while photographing to microfiche said newspaper, notices that the normally error-free paper contains 58 errors, unheard-of in the past.As Ava seeks to decode the message, Elaine continues to struggle under nazi occupation and continue her vital work with the Resistance.In our current time we take for granted that we will have our morning coffee or tea, as well as bread for toast, and soap with which to wash. During nazi occupation and rationing, the citizens under nazi rule where subjected to hardships beyond our imagination, yet they persevered to survive. Elaine's struggle brings this to life.Spoiler alert .... pleasant ending.",

I cared about these characters, aspects of the story were historically new to me, and interesting, and the pacing and tension kept me reading way too far into the after-midnights! WW2 is a rich mother load of stories, and as long as they are as well-written as The Librarian Spy, I will read forever. Ms. Martin is a masterful writer who can capture the essence and colorations of a person and the elusive realities of inexplicable concepts of humanity and inhumanity amidst crucial points in human history.",

                "reviewText": "Helene Belanger lives in occupied Lyon, France, and longs to join the Resistance, but her husband Joseph, who fought in the Great War is adamantly opposed, which leads to a fight and Joesph storming out. It has been two days and he has not returned, Helene is worried, she cannot go to the police as they are in with the Gestapo, and even Joesph\u2019s best friend Etienne is missing. She is debating her options when there is a knock at her door and a woman looking for a man named Pierre, she is frantic, she is Jewish and needs new ID papers and Helene soon realizes that her husband is the man she is looking for and gives the woman her own papers. She then sets out to find Etienne for answers, but he finds her when she is stopped by the Nazi patrol asking for her papers. Etienne gives the man papers, proclaiming her to be Elaine Rousseau. Etienne takes her back to his flat and Helene learns the awful truth, her husband is part of the Resistance and has been captured. At that moment, Helene is no more and Elaine is born, Elaine who will stop at nothing to save her husband and annihilate the Nazis. She begins to work for the Resistance by delivering and later printing anti-Nazi tracts. It is how she meets a young Jewish woman named Sarah and her son Noah, Sarah\u2019s husband Lewis is in America, she stayed behind to tend to her sick mother, thinking that she would be safe. But now she is being hunted and has no way to get a visa or even a flight to the States. Despite being told to leave it be by her superiors, she can\u2019t ignore Sarah\u2019s plight, with so much loss in her life, she needs to help them and sends a coded message in the Resistance\u2019s publication \u201cCombat\u201d.Ava Harper is a librarian working in the Rare Book Room at the Library of Congress when she is asked to join the war effort by working for the Office of Strategic Services, gathering publications that may contain covert information on the Nazis. She would have to relocate to Lisbon, Portugal, a trip that she is not keen on making, but when she is reminded that her brother Daniel and many other soldiers fighting in the war need this intel, there is no way she can decline and makes the move to Lisbon. She is trying to settle in but soon learns that spies abound in Lisbon, and feels somewhat adrift. But luckily, an experienced British agent intervenes and takes her in under his wing and soon she is making her own contacts with other agents and the many refugees seeking asylum in neutral Portugal. She falls into a routine of collecting papers and magazines each day from around the world, and it is in the French paper \u201cCombat\u201d that she finds a coded message begging for help in extricating a young Jewish woman and her child from occupied Lyon and reuniting them with her husband in America. And even though her job is to simply collect data, there is no way Ava can ignore this cry for help. And so begins a joint collaboration to save Sarah and Noah from under the noses of the Nazis.When I first read the blurb for this book, I was sure I wouldn\u2019t like a story with two protagonists' POVs, but couldn\u2019t have been more wrong! The imagery and the attention to historic detail are outstanding and the writing is practically flawless. I was sucked in from the first page and could barely read the words fast enough to satisfy my need to know what would happen next. Be warned and have your tissues at the ready, because war is ugly and cruel, and this book doesn\u2019t shy away from the horrors, nor does it sugarcoat the egregious acts perpetrated by the Nazis. But even with the death, destruction, and malice running rampant, there are moments of joy, comradery, and even love, that save this book from becoming a dark, depressing read. I loved this story and can\u2019t recommend this powerful and emotional story highly enough.",

I\u2019m not sure what was missing but it was just sort of flat for me. It was still very good. I would recommend it. But there are other stories out there that just rip your heart out without being gory or sensational.",

It took halfway through the book for the story to pick up speed. A really great book, I cannot put down and will read late into the night\u2026 but I found myself thankful when a chapter was over so I could take a break. The overall story was interesting but the pace was off. Also, I got the feeling that the author sat with a thesaurus coming up with as many adjectives as possible. Not every noun needs an adjective! I was frustrated with the wordy descriptions - sometimes less is more. Not one of my better purchases unfortunately.",

                "reviewText": "\u201cFrom the New York Times bestselling author of The Last Bookshop in London comes a moving new novel inspired by the true history of America\u2019s library spies of World War II.\u201dThis was a very edifying read for me as it portrays yet another side of the war (WW2) which I knew little about\u2026ie: the real roles and sacrifices made by these librarians and printers, and how huge a part coded messages had to play.Ava\u2019s job as a senior librarian at the Library of Congress is everything she ever dreamed of. She loves her role amongst the old tomes passionately, their words are music to her senses.But when she is offered a secret position in Lisbon by the US military posing as a librarian whilst secretly gathering intelligence to be used in coded messages, she feels duty bound to go and do her bit for the war effort.At the same time Elaine (or H\u00e9l\u00e8ne) has begun an apprenticeship at a printing press in a warehouse in occupied France which is secretly run by members of the Resistance.The job is very dangerous as the Nazis hold a very prominent presence in Lyon and are especially committed to finding and destroying the printing press which they know is being worked by members of the Resistance to inform the allies of their movements through coded messages\u2026.their commitments knows no limits!Both of these women (among several others and many men) played vital roles and paid high prices in this particular war effort.Both women made sacrifices and suffered greatly in their own differing ways.This was a gripping story of extremes in love, loss, grief and unfathomable hardship and suffering.It is an important story which deserves telling.I took my time reading this one because there are several parts to this story and I wanted to absorb each one fully, it did make a difference when it all started to merge into the bigger picture which all came together very well.I\u2019m so glad that these true stories are being researched and written about now, and I take my hat off to this author and to others who are doing this work.It will surely better educate people about the horrors and atrocities that were inflicted upon so many innocent and unassuming people during WW2, as well as service men and women\u2026Lest We Forget.5\u2b50\ufe0fs",
