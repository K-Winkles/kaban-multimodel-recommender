                "reviewText": "This plot focuses on characters that are not interested in marriage, and a few that are. Unexpected meetings suddenly causes doubt in those determined to remain single, and jealousy and manipulations develop from those seeking to find their happiness any way possible. Drama, mistrust, and nefarious intentions comes to a head at the ending. The independent, strong-minded characters tend to struggle with trust issues, and thereby lacking faith in others. The author did a great job in creating detailed scenes, well-developed characters, and adding a bit of drama or two to create the necessary conflict. This is a great historical romance, with a bit of sluggish movement in the middle. The title of the story leaves me wondering what the Earl\u2019s promise was? I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

The characters had some confusion about them , some strong some not. Alicia is different from most ladies of the ton as she likes to garden, likes to speak her mind, not holding anything back and she doesn't fuss over her gowns or hair. Her friend, Lily, is one of these girls. Looking for a rich husband this season. Oscar is an Earl who Lily wants but he wants Alicia. Lily tries as hard to be noticed by Oscar hoping to win her. Has some blocks before Alicia and Oscar get their happily ever after. Would recommend to others.I am an ARC and leave this unbiased, honest review.",

Alice's parents were called the Suffolk's and then reversed when Oscar's mom was introduced. I would recommend this book if you don't mind the mistakes.

                "reviewText": "I quite enjoyed the plot of this story but there were confusing errors. The names of the characters sometimes changed e.g. Alice was called Alicia twice in the introduction, she was later addressed as Lady Cornwall instead of Lady Alice. Her parents were addressed as Lord/Lady Suffolk when they were actually Lord/Lady Cornwall. It made it difficult to follow at times. I appreciated the interest Alice had in plants and botany. I also admired Oscar's determination in pursuing Alice. I felt that Oscar's mother's grief was understandable but would have liked to read that she became more settled by the end of the story. She was mentioned in the extended epilogue though. Lily's jealousy was cruel but was resolved in the end. There were good points in the story and it will be improved when the errors are corrected.",
