            "Editorial Reviews From the Back Cover \"Jennifer Deibel's debut is rich in atmosphere, family mystery, and sweet romance. A gem!\"--Julie Klassen, author of The Bridge to Belle IslandAll her life, Boston-born Moira Doherty has relished her mother's descriptions of the Emerald Isle. When her mother dies unexpectedly in the summer of 1920, Moira is compelled to fulfill her dying wish--that she become the teacher in Ballymann, the beloved village in Donegal, Ireland, she's heard so much about.After an arduous voyage, Moira begins a challenging new job in an unfamiliar and ancient country. Though a few locals offer a warm welcome, others are distanced by superstition and suspicion. Rumors about Moira's mother are unspoken in her presence but threaten to derail everything she's journeyed to Ballymann to do. Moira must rely on the kindness of a handful of friends--and the strength of Sean, an unsettlingly handsome thatcher who keeps popping up unannounced--as she seeks to navigate a life she'd never dreamed of . . . but perhaps was meant to live.\"With an authenticity born of having lived in Ireland herself, the author deftly paints a lush landscape, colorful customs, and memorable characters with personal journeys of their own.

                "reviewText": "If you like stories set in Ireland that have the flavor of the Gaelic language, with a touch of romance and a flair of mystery, here is the book to read. The novel is a debut by author Jennifer Deibel who has herself been immersed in the Irish culture shares the richness of the Emerald Island through this tale. The lead character is a young woman currently living in Boston with her mother; her name is Moira Doherty. Moira\u2019s mother has been sharing stories of Ireland for all of Moira\u2019s life. They stirred in her heart the desire to go there someday. Well, for Moira that day has arrived. After losing her mother and not sure what she is to do, she senses the Lord telling her to go forward with her plans. With her head filled with stories of her mother\u2019s homeland along with the ache of her mother\u2019s death, Moira steps into her future. From the moment she lands on the island, she encounters a different language with some very different customs and beliefs. Moira is welcomed into her temporary place of residence as she acclimates to the area in preparation to teach the children of the town\u2019s school.Throughout the book there is something in Moira\u2019s past that she is unaware of, but all the people in town seem to know and look at her with questioning eyes. Moira is a young woman with hopes to understand what has drawn her to the very town her mother grew up in and what secret lies in her mother\u2019s life that is impacting Moira\u2019s life now. Moira is befriended by most of the local town\u2019s people though she has a few of them who are threatening her with revealing her secret, the secret Moira doesn\u2019t know.The climax in the book is well written and comes with such heart-pounding force I couldn\u2019t help but continue reading to see how it would be resolved. The book started out slow for me but quickly progressed as I was drawn into the mystery of what lay behind Moira\u2019s life. The author has another Irish romance novel forthcoming, and a teaser is included in the back of the book. I look forward to her next book that I hope includes the flavors of faith, romance and a touch of mystery.",

                "reviewText": "Escape to the windswept shores of Ireland and experience a small Irish village through the eyes of Moira, the new American schoolteacher who has returned to the place of her mother\u2019s birth to shepherd the students of the small community. Upon her arrival, she finds that her mother\u2019s reputation is not what it should be, and she deals with foes young and old who hold the past against her. Amid it all, the kind and handsome thatcher Sean shows strength and compassion through various trials and tribulations, and an undeniable connection is formed. As troubles abound, Moira questions her choice in starting this new life she never dreamed of, but that God has designed especially for her.Rich with descriptions of the Emerald Isle and her culture, this story allows escape to the wonderous place that is Ireland. I truly felt like I was standing on the cliffs of Ireland with Moira. I could hear the Irish music floating on the wind. I could hear the lilt of the voices in the village. I could see the rolling green hills dotted with thatched cottages and stone ruins. As someone who is longing to visit Ireland, this book was a fantastic escape until I can experience the real thing. The story was rich in historical knowledge and cultural depiction that I loved, and I feel like we really get a glimpse of life in a small Irish village in the 1920s. While the story is a wonderful example of redeeming love and forgiveness, this was not a light-hearted story. It is rich with lessons and spiritual truths, but there are parts of the narrative that are much heavier in subject than I ever expected. However, the heavy parts of this book clearly define the message of God\u2019s redeeming love and restoration, which is perfectly depicted by the time you reach the story\u2019s wonderful ending. I wish the romance were more prominent in the plot, but the protective and handsome hero and strong heroine make the love story sweet as they face troubles together. With strong spiritual truths, unparalleled depictions of Ireland and her culture, well-developed and heartfelt characters, a gentle romance, and a heartwarming conclusion, this story is a well-written gem and should not be missed. I highly recommend A Dance in Donegal to any fellow lover of Ireland and her culture, and I cannot wait to see what Jennifer Deibel does in her next sweeping Irish romance.I received a copy of this book from the author and the publisher for review purposes. My thoughts are my own. I really did enjoy it!",

                "reviewText": "In just a little over 300 pages, Jennifer Deibel has succeeded in pulling me deeply into the lives of the people of Ballymann, and I want to know more......More about Moira, the strong yet vulnerable adventurer whose reliance on God, faith, forgiveness, and willingness to learn left me wondering about her earlier years in Boston and what is next in store for her in Ireland....More about the people Moira met here: more of Peg and Colm\u2019s love story; how Sean and Declan became such opposites after growing up in the same place and time; and more of the children at Moira\u2019s school.The exploration of cultures, superstitions, and unapologetic sharing of faith in God regardless of background inspire me to be mindful of my own approach to situations whether joyful or painful.I found the reading pace to be comfortable, with descriptions of people, the land and sea, and village life being sufficient to paint pictures in my mind without getting bogged down in the details.Special kudos to Hannah, artist and the daughter of the author, for the map which is so helpful in imagining the physical layout and distances among sites in and around the village. Thank you for sharing this precious gift.I received a free advance copy of this book as a member of the launch team, and purchased a copy to share as well. This is my honest review, and I eagerly await the next of what I believe will be many more inspiring novels from Jennifer Deibel.",
