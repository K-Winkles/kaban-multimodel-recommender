                "reviewText": "This is a heart rendering story about a small Jewish girl named Miriam, sent to an English family to escape the terror of Nazi rule in Czechoslovakia during WWII. Miriam's mother had faced a cruel attack from a young Hitler youth and didn't want her daughter, Miriam, to suffer at the hands of the Nazis. Miriam lived with a foster family in England who loved her. Miriam had no idea the horrors her family faced when captured and sent to Terizen prison and ultimately to Auschwitz. With a turn of events at Terizen, Eva, Miriam's mother, was surprised and horrified at seeing her attacker from years earlier. Events transpired that would shape their lives for years to come. I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't read it yet.I would've given this five stars, but in editing, there were parts of the book that segued into other parts very awkwardly and didn't make sense. Also, there was a part where Pamela, Miriam's English foster mother, fell on a ski trail and broke her leg. While in the hospital, she met a Czech family. The young son's name was Tomas. Later in the story, Pamela's son, Will, met a young man in the RAF named Tomas. Pamela wondered if he could be the same Tomas she met years earlier in the hospital. It was never followed up on to see if that was the case.Otherwise, it's an excellent read with characters you can love and feel empathy toward.",

                "reviewText": "The Child on Platform One is by Gail Thompson. This book is realistic as well as being extremely emotional. The novel is based on true events in history and G ail Thompson has taken pains to create a historically correct novel. You do have to keep reminding yourself that this story about the Kindertransport is still a fiction book.The novel begins in Prague in 1039 when Eva, because of a secret she has never revealed to her husband, ignores her husband\u2019s opinion and prepares to send their daughter, Miriam, to England on the Nicholas Winton Kindertransport. Eva has her Mother\u2019s support but fails to tell her husband until it is too late. When Miriam arrives in London, the adoptive parents were not there and would be unable to care for Miriam. They did leave the money they had sent for her there for her care. Mrs. Pamela Denison had taken on the volunteer job of meeting the trains and making sure the children go t to their proper new homes. When no home was found for Miriam, Pamela took her home intending to tell her husband after the fact. As Quakers, Pamela and Hugh Denison are against war; but not against helping the innocent victims. Their son, Will, who had been away at school, had decided he would join the RAF and fight for their freedom. He felt he didn\u2019t have a choice in spite of his religion. The hardest part of his leaving was his having to leave Miriam, because they had grown so close as children. When the Blitz began in London, Pamela reluctantly sent Miriam to a Quaker school in the country. Here among other children who know nothing about the state their parents are in, Miriam feels at home and continues her education while waiting for letters from her mother.Meanwhile, Eva and her husband and her parents are sent to Theresenstadt. Their lives here are told in historical detail which is consistent to that learned about the camp. Eva becomes involved with a musical group which stages musical evenings for the inmates and the Nazis. In this group, Eva becomes acquainted with a lovely girl, Hanna. Hanna was there without her parents as they had been shipped on. Eva took her under her wings and as she played the piano for the musical evenings, she helped Hanna learn to sing the various parts. Eva discovers that Hanna is the baby she had as the result of rape and that she had to give away. Hannah\u2019s biological father is one of the guards. Can he help Hanna to survive?The story is quite emotional. Be sure to have tissues available. It also really makes you think about mothers and the things they give up for their children or how far they will go for them. It is also a lesson in giving your children the background needed, then setting them out into the world to survive even when they take paths you are not sure you want them to.",

                "reviewText": "A talented young Jewish girl left her piano lessons a few minutes late because her teacher wanted to correct a mistake she had made. It was nearing dark when she left the Conservatory so she hurried home. She approached a park-a shortcut to her home. Her parents were expecting her to be home already. She took the shortcut and rushed toward home. Four young military men were blocking her way. One of the me raped her. She soon realized she was pregnant. She had the baby and suffered the shame but refused to give the child up for adoption.A few years later, Nazi Germany had decided that the world would be better without Jews. They began the extermination of Jews. Fearing for her daughter's safety, she sent her on Kindertransport to London where she would be safe with a family. Miriam adjusted to this new family, but missed her parents.The Nazis eventually succeeded rounding up most of the Jews. They were sent to concentration camps where they were starved and worked to death. If they survived they were set to death camps where they were gassed and cremated.This book is the story of a family and their struggle to survive. Most did not survive, but that did not mean that their story died when they did.",

                "reviewText": "A moving ww2 fiction novel based around a Jewish girl in Prague sent to England to escape the Nazis while her family remain behind. It makes you want to keep turning the pages, although the story of the main protagonist in England is perhaps inevitably much less compelling than the story of the Jewish family, and what happened to the English woman\u2019s son seemed less developed than maybe it could have been. Maybe what this story should make us all question is our attitude to refugees and why our governments seem so reluctant to help children in danger, although even back then the numbers we let in were small and many in government opposed it.",

                "reviewText": "I loved everything about this book! I learned so much more about the events of World War 2. I had always known that Jewish children were smuggled to England from a variety of countries, but this book totally brought that to life. The characters were so engaging. I was completely invested in each of their lives and found it very easy to picture them and hear them in my mind. The writing was beautiful and I was compelled to read it in a hurry, it was hard to put down.",
