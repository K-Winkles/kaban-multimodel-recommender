                "reviewText": "Another great book in the Lady\u2019s Pact Collection by Maybel Bardot. In this Lady\u2019s Pact, four close friends vow to help each other out by switching duties with each other. In this one Daphne Parsons agrees to help Caroline out by attending a dinner party. Daphne has stayed out of the social circle since her disastrous scandal 3 years ago were her fianc\u00e9 Lord Wright, Gerard Wallace, had been discovered with another woman. Her friends felt this dinner party would be just the thing to get her circulating once again. While there Daphne comes to the aid of a lady, Cecilia, who has tea spilled down her dress and she in turn introduces Daphne to her brother, Andrew Curtis, the Duke of Talbot, and her cousin, James Townshend, the Viscount of Frampton. Andrew is a known rake and is thought to be the author Sir Donald Pemberton. Daphne also rescues Lady Elizabeth Rake from a group of bullies but ends up taking a dare to do so. And what is the dare? None other than to kiss the Duke of Talbot. What happens from that point makes a delightfully splendid story with a little heartbreak, a little making up and a lot of trouble in the making but more loving for the taking. This is a marriage of convenience to a rake no less that soon becomes more when forced into the light from an ex fianc\u00e9. Can you guess who the real Sir Donald Pemberton is? A mystery to solve.I received a free Advanced Readers\u2019 Copy of this book but was given no monetary compensation. I read for the enjoyment and voluntarily review so that others may know what to expect and authors may be helped by critique and encouragement.",

Even though neither of them planned for this they both did feel some spark or attraction between them. Daphne on a dare, taken to protect Elizabeth from being bullied, kissed Andrew and boy did that set off fireworks. Andrew was also being pressured to marry and also with the memory of knowing that his father would have wanted him to find a wife. Yet he had a tumultuous past where his mother was not kind and had numerous affairs that he felt led to the eventual death of his father. Upon finding out that Daphne\u2019s brother was struggling financially and realizing that he could do a lot worse in a woman he proposed to Daphne; who promptly turned him down. Daphne had never planned to marry and was thrown Into a panic by Andrew\u2019s proposal and refused to believe him that it would benefit him and her as she did not think her family was struggling financially, until she received a letter from her brother telling her to come home as he had something important to discuss with her. She then knew that she had to accept Andrew\u2019s proposal as otherwise she might end up with an old man who she would have nothing in common with; but was sad because she always wanted to marry for love and not convenience. It was a moving and touching story that was enlivened by a jealous and deranged past suitor. The ending of course was most satisfying as the emotions and connections between Andrew and Daphne had fully broken down any remaining doubts about how thy felt about each other and love was in full bloom between the two of them.",

Daphne who cannot stop herself from stepping up to those who would inflict harsh treatment on someone else. In steps, Andrew, Duke of Talbot, and the sparks fly. It\u2019s a wild ride with these two in the front seat. An ill-conceived marriage of convenience, once again proves to be quite troublesome. Secrets unravel, love is found and then revealed to help them forge a path together. Add an unhinged, jealous ex-finance to the \u2018secret\u2019 list who helps fast forward the path home. Always a romp, always great to read about two souls finding each other, and themselves as they forge a path together. I love that all these Regency Rakes and ladies have so much time to spend on each other, and always find their way home. I look forward to this author's stories. Descriptive, well written fulfill my need for Regency romance. I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.",

Daphne has agreed to attend a dinner party, as she has not been out in society for some time due to a scandal. She fulfills a dare, which causes an unexpected connection with Andrew. Due to Daphne\u2019s poor family financial situation, and that Andrew is being pressured to marry, they agree to marry. And so it begins\u2026\u2026 The story is well written with an engaging plot, and interesting characters, encouraging me to care about the characters and their paths. Ms Bardot is great at adding intrigue, secrets and betrayals, making you wonder how will they find their true happiness. And then the added drama from a past suitor brings more excitement to the story.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed this story. Duke Andrew was a rake but he knew he needed to marry soon. Lady Daphne was at a ball when she saw a you g lady being bullied by a group of young ladies. She intervened but in order to stop the bullying the group dared Daphne to kiss the Duke. She did kiss him and this led to their marriage of convenience. Unfortunately, Daphne's ex-fiance was not happy. This story had a good mix of happenings. There was the bullying, gossip, a marriage of convenience, an abduction, attempted murder and lots of steam. A good, well-written read.",

When two strong characters have set their mind to something, they will never stop trying to convince the other to see things their way which provides an entertaining read full of sparks, sizzle and laugh out loud moments for the reader.",

The plot was promising at the beginning but became more and more long-winded as the story progressed and the part that was supposed to be suspenseful was boring and poorly executed. There are better books by the author.Daphne is shy and doesn\u2019t like social events. Andrew is a rake who doesn\u2019t believe in love. They meet at a dinner party she is attending instead of her friend Caroline. They are immediately attracted to each other. After she is dared to kiss him by other ladies, he offers her a marriage of convenience based on desire, which she accepts to save her brother from ruin. But in order to convince the others, they have to pretend to be deeply in love and both have no expectations that it might come true\u2026",
