Roasted in the oven, the asparagus becomes crispy and sharp. Not only are they good for you, but they're tasty, too.Quintus and Lucius leave their home town, Nursia, to seek purpose in Rome. Quintus goes in hopes of finding a patron to send food to Nursia, and Lucius plans to join the army. What they discover is a complicated political climate that threatens their own goals, and they must choose who to swear fealty to.Vincent B. Davis II brought the Roman time period to life for the modern reader. He captured the realities and ideals of the army, and appropriately so, since he has served his country as well, which I found out in the author bio. However, in a few instances, the story pacing jarred me right off the page, but I climbed back into the story to find out what would happen. Overall, I enjoyed experiencing Rome through Quintus and Lucius.If you are intrigued by Roman history, The Man With Two Names is for you.",

                "reviewText": "You may know there is an established literary genre for historical fictions, usually focusing on the Empire. There are several authors known to all fans of this time and place, all excellent reading; educational and entertaining. But, there is a cookie-cutter quality to all of these series.I applaud these Sertorious novels because they do not follow the beaten path. I do not need anymore lengthy, repetitive descriptions of human intestines spilling onto a warrior's lap. I am tired of the predictable subplot where the lady love is cruelly assasinated. I am tired of page filling descriptions of an age cleaving a man from skull to crotch.Mr. Davis, in his Stertotious novels, understands that when a reader asks for the time of day, he hasn't asked how to build a watch. I highly recommend these books by Vincent B. Davis II. You get the full story at a reasonable pace. Hasten Thy Story, someone said. I see Hemingway as a model for these fat-free historical fictions. Highly recommend.",

This book tells us so much more of what it was like it ancient Rome. I found it very interesting as well as informative. I've read stories about Rome but this one drew me into it. Possibly because even though there is a main character, so many other characters added so much to the story line. In this novel there is plenty of mystery, intrigue, descriptions of political and military protocols and how they vied against each other. Many type of relationships that included brotherly love, romantic love, as well as the opposite in personal enemies as well as the enemies against Rome. Very good read.",
