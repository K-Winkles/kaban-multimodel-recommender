        "description": "Instant New York Times best seller!Inspired by the real-life heroine who saved thousands of Jewish children during WWII, The Warsaw Orphan is Kelly Rimmer\u2019s most anticipated novel since her best-selling sensation, The Things We Cannot Say. \u201cGripping... This one easily stands on its own.\u201d (Publishers Weekly)\u201cHeart-stopping.\u201d (Lisa Wingate, number-one New York Times best-seling author)\u201cA surefire hit.\u201d (Kristin Harmel, number-one New York Times best-selling author)In the spring of 1942, young Elzbieta Rabinek is aware of the swiftly growing discord just beyond the courtyard of her comfortable Warsaw home. She has no fondness for the Germans who patrol her streets and impose their curfews, but has never given much thought to what goes on behind the walls that contain her Jewish neighbors. She knows all too well about German brutality - and that it's the reason she must conceal her true identity. But in befriending Sara, a nurse who shares her apartment floor, Elzbieta makes a discovery that propels her into a dangerous world of deception and heroism.Using Sara's credentials to smuggle children out of the ghetto brings Elzbieta face-to-face with the reality of the war behind its walls, and to the plight of the Gorka family, who must make the impossible decision to give up their newborn daughter or watch her starve. For Roman Gorka, this final injustice stirs him to rebellion with a zeal not even his newfound love for Elzbieta can suppress. But his recklessness brings unwanted attention to Sara's cause, unwittingly putting Elzbieta and her family in harm's way until one violent act threatens to destroy their chance at freedom forever. From Nazi occupation to the threat of a communist regime, The Warsaw Orphan is the unforgettable story of Elzbieta and Roman's perilous attempt to reclaim the love and life they once knew.

                "reviewText": "Kelly Rimmer has done it again! One of the queen's of historical fiction has written an amazing, heart wrenching novel! I cried more than once while reading this, as I do in most of her historical fiction.It is emotional, poignant, heartbreaking and hopeful \u2013 capturing the harshness in the war years for many, including the Polish. First with the arrival of the Germans, and then the Soviets control... They suffered terribly \u2013 The Warsaw Orphan shows the reader all the emotions of the time \u2013 and with a filling of hope along the way.The Things We Cannot Say was one of my favourite books of 2019, so I was touched by the connection between that novel and this one. This one also depicts the horrors of the Holocaust with emphasis on the Warsaw Ghetto, the Polish Uprising and the strength and bravery of the resistance. This story pulls no punches. It's one of constant starvation, brutality, death, and destruction.It\u2019s not easy to read- from the beginning it is heart breaking stories, reflective of the Holocaust. There\u2019s starvation, an overcrowded ghetto, and a poor nine year old boy whose unpaid job it is to help the police pick up the dead bodies in the street... Kelly Rimmer has done an amazing job at capturing the details of the day to day life in the ghetto, the growing fear and understanding of what was to come with the deportations to the death camps.",
