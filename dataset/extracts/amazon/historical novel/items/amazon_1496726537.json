                "reviewText": "Author: Amanda SkenandoreRating: Four out of Four antiseptic bandagesEase Of Reading: 352 pages. Relax because you\u2019re in the hands of a master narrator. Plenty of narrative balls to juggle with no risk of dropping any of them.When To read: After watching several episodes of Grey\u2019s Anatomy and realizing that the history of medicine and women\u2019s role wasn\u2019t simply groping in one of the many supply closets in the hospital.The Nurse\u2019s Secret is one of those novels that reignites the title and subtitle debate. The title, The Nurse\u2019s Secret, alludes to a medical story or even a romance novel. In reality, the novel is both and so much more. The Nurse\u2019s Secret is indeed a medical tale with a romantic piece. But it is also a sharp commentary on the gross inequality of 1880s America in big cities like New York City.Moreover, the novel pokes its stick at male dominance, female submission, medical ignorance, and the birth of a new medical profession.Author Amanda Skenandore is a historical fiction writer by trade and a registered nurse. Her practical expertise and historical chops steer the novel toward dramatic mastery with a \u2018pay no attention to the man behind the curtain\u201d skill.Kensington, the book\u2019s publisher, summarizes the book this way: \u201cBased on Florence Nightingale\u2019s nursing principles, Bellevue is the first school of its kind in the country. Where once nurses were assumed to be ignorant and unskilled, Bellevue prizes discipline, intellect, and moral character, and only young women of good breeding need apply. At first, Una balks at her prim classmates and the doctors\u2019 endless commands. Yet life on the streets has prepared her for the horrors of injury and disease found on the wards, and she slowly gains friendship and self-respect.\u201cJust as she finds her footing, Una\u2019s suspicions about a patient\u2019s death put her at risk of exposure, and will force her to choose between her instinct for self-preservation, and exposing her identity in order to save others.\u201dThe narrative pacing is deliberate and descriptively dense, yet the author needs to pace the story carefully because the novel operates on so many levels simultaneously.First, the novel introduces the class struggle of the impoverished in the dark recesses of the Gilded Age in New York City in the 1880s. That stark inequality and outward disgust toward the \u201cstreet people\u201d infects the entire narrative and the mystery.Second, there are the medical components of the story, and they multiply seamlessly. The reader learns about the Florence Nightingale-inspired nursing school at Bellevue Hospital, where only proper woman with distinguished backgrounds can apply. Again, the class warfare invades. Then the reader watches the subjugation of the female nurses and trainees by the doctors, administrators, and society. In that time and place, doctors are incapable of mistakes and never second-guessed.The author slickly injects Joseph Lister and his germ theory, as the English doctor\u2019s theory of antiseptic care was just beginning to take root in the medical profession after years of being ridiculed and rejected.The author then uses his nursing training with great skill to educate the reader as well as Una and her roommate-nurse trainee Dru. That medical knowledge was then used skillfully to advance the medical mystery and ultimately criminal acts.Third, the novel slow churns a budding romance between a young doctor at the hospital and Una, with the suitor unaware of Una\u2019s true, sordid past. That simmering romance links to the oppression of the lower classes and to male domination in society and in relationships at that time.Finally, there is the journey of the main character, Una. Here, Skenandore paints her brushstrokes of Una with painstaking care, compositional excellence and three-dimensional depth. It\u2019s Una\u2019s voice we hear throughout the novel, and the reader is so meticulously drawn into her world that it\u2019s literary immersion at its best.The Nurse\u2019s Secret enabled me to enjoy a medical history tome, a criminal mystery, a romance novel, a socio-economic tract, a female empowerment tale, and the personal growth of a young woman destined like so many others in 1883 to a short, brutish life. The novel is a showcase for a talented author like Amanda Skenandore, and would be fun for readers in either print, ebook or audiobook versions.",

                "reviewText": "This is the second book I've read by Amanda Skenadore. Just like in her other book, The Second Life of Mirielle West, Skenadore presented me with a main character that I didn't like at all, only to slowly redeem her to the point that I was cheering for her to persevere and thrive. In this book, I thought I was going to be reading about a nurse, but the protagonist Una was a professional thief, who picked pockets and pilfered through luggage at the train station to make a living. She was forced to hand over her loot to the boss of a criminal ring, who gave her thieves barely enough money to scrape by. In return, the thieves received police protection, secured by the boss through bribes, in case they were caught. Una made the mistake of secretly keeping a large jewel that she attempted to fence on her own, cutting out the middleman. Shortly thereafter, Una became a murder suspect, but her boss found out about Una's disloyalty and disavowed her. Another suspect fingered Una for the murder to get out of jail herself. When Una escaped, she had no money and nowhere to go where she would not be recognized by \"coppers,\" as Una referred to them. About 22% through the book, Una faked her way into a probationary nurses' training program at a prestigious hospital. Her lifestyle was immediately improved, but Una had no intention of completing the program. She planned to lie low until the ruckus about the murder died down and she could find some way of leaving New York City altogether to start over somewhere else. She had to put up with a naive and overly enthusiastic roommate, who unwittingly helped Una fake her way through exams and procedures. Una had rules for living on the street, one of which was not to have any friends or romantic involvements. Her \"temporary\" stay at the training school tested both of those resolves. An unexpected complication developed when some patients at the hospital died mysteriously of what were ruled to be suicides, but Una began to suspect murders. Suicides and unexplained deaths brought police to the hospital, leaving Una on edge that she would be recognized. Just as Una realized that perhaps she could really pursue a life as a nurse and she had broken her rules about friendships and romance, her true identity was revealed, putting her on the run and disowned by her love interest. Then Una got a clue as to who may have committed the murder of which she herself was accused. With no friends to assist, she followed that clue with the reluctant help of a reporter who had once interviewed her about her life as a thief. A terrifying and shocking scene unfolded with a highly unlikely ally coming to her aid at the very last moment. If you read this book, suffer through the first 20% where there is not a nurse in sight. Skenandore had her reasons and delivered a satisfying ending.",
