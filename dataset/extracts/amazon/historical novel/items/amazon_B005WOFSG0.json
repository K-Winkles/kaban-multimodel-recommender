        "description": "Passion. Danger. Witchcraft.... The Lady of the Rivers is number-one New York Times best-selling author Philippa Gregory\u2019s remarkable story of Jacquetta, Duchess of Bedford, a woman who navigated a treacherous path through the battle lines in the Wars of the Roses. Descended from Melusina, the river goddess, Jacquetta always has had the gift of second sight. As a child visiting her uncle, she met his prisoner, Joan of Arc, and saw her own power reflected in the young woman accused of witchcraft. They share the mystery of the tarot card of the wheel of fortune before Joan is taken to a horrific death at the hands of the English rulers of France. Jacquetta understands the danger for a woman who dares to dream. Jacquetta is married to the Duke of Bedford, English regent of France, and he introduces her to a mysterious world of learning and alchemy. Her only friend in the great household is the duke\u2019s squire, Richard Woodville, who is at her side when the duke\u2019s death leaves her a wealthy young widow. The two become lovers and marry in secret, returning to England to serve at the court of the young King Henry VI, where Jacquetta becomes a close and loyal friend to his new queen. The Woodvilles soon achieve a place at the very heart of the Lancaster court, though Jacquetta can sense the growing threat from the people of England and the danger of royal rivals. Not even their courage and loyalty can keep the House of Lancaster on the throne. Henry the king slides into a mysterious sleep; Margaret the queen turns to untrustworthy favorites for help; and Richard, Duke of York, threatens to overturn the whole kingdom for his rival dynasty. Jacquetta fights for her king, her queen, and for her daughter, Elizabeth, for whom Jacquetta can sense an extraordinary and unexpected future: a change of fortune, the throne of England, and the white rose of York. A sweeping, powerful story rich in passion and legend and drawing on years of research, The Lady of the Rivers tells the story of the real-life mother of the white queen. Read more",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars I think this book could be retitled, \"Margaret of Anjou: Hell hath no Fury like a Woman Scorned.\"",
                "reviewText": "First, I think I should be clear that the only reason I went looking for anything on the War of the Roses was because of the Song of Fire and Ice (aka Game of Thrones) series by George RR Martin. In an interview he said that a lot of his inspiration for the series came from the War of the Roses.If you like courtly intrigue and medieval power struggles, then this is a novel for you. The whole story will make you very grateful that you did not have to live during the age of feudalism, especially as a woman. Even the author says that she would never ever want to live in any of the courts that she writes about.I think this book could be retitled, \"Margaret of Anjou: Hell hath no Fury like a Woman Scorned.\" This is mostly a book about Margaret of Anjou and her quest for revenge against everyone affiliated with the house of York, with Jacquetta acting largely as a narrator. Part of the book is devoted solely to Jacquetta, her husband(s) and her 14 children but I would estimate that at least 70% of the book is about interaction with Margaret.There is a lot of witchcraft in this book, which is mostly used as a plot device for foreshadowing. Some reviews have complained about the abundance of witchcraft references in the book, but I think they serve two purposes: (1) the foreshadowing of events and (2) to demonstrate how dangerous it was to be a woman who also attempted to have any social power/influence outside of sewing with her ladies. In modern times most people will say that the idea of blaming everything on witchcraft is ridiculous, but in the middle ages there were legitimately a lot of people who believed in witchcraft/magic/witch related superstitions. It's not any more ridiculous to believe in witchcraft than it is for people to believe that they can turn iron into gold and use it to fund their massive armies. However, I do agree there is a lot of overly witchy references, to the point that I half expected the Monty Python witch/floating/ducks float scene to take place in one of the villages.This is a prequel to The White Queen of the same series, and a lot of the witchy foreshadowing references events in The White Queen (about Jacquetta's daughter Elizabeth), so you could read this before The White Queen and catch all the reference later or read it after The White Queen and consider it backstory",

                "reviewText": "You always know what you're going to get with a Gregory book: easy to read HF set against the background of mostly accurate historical events as seen through the eyes of her characters. This one retells the romance of Jaquetta of Luxembourg and her lifelong love affair with Richard Woodville. These nobles were the parents of Elizabeth Woodville, later bride of Edward IV, but their story ends here long before their daughter's ascent to the throne of England. Most of the narrative relates to their years in the court of the monarchs they served: addled Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou, she deserving of the moniker \"she wolf.\" The fact that Jaquetta had 14 children also gives you an idea as to what a good bit of the story is about. This work is very typical of the romance historical fiction so popular right now. Unfortunately, it suffers from the same problem rife in so many of these books, namely, horrible English grammar. I began dreading running across such sentences as these taken directly from the text: \"I was only a head taller than her now.\" \"I was younger than her when I first did that.\" \"The queen may not be as lucky as me.\" Is it unreasonable to expect professional writers to be proficient in their own language? Are there no longer editors and proofreaders? Did everyone fall asleep during English class? Granted, this is a personal gripe on my part, but I have little patience with published works littered with elementary grammar errors. It is discouraging that such mistakes in print only serve to exacerbate the problem of our eroding knowlege of and interest in proper English. If this is an issue for you too, be forewarned.",

Captivating and detailed enough to give you all the character context without overwriting trivial details. Excellent prequel to the series to give you context of what happens in the following novels and what the background significance is.Delivery was fast, description accurate and the paperback copy was in pristine shape!",
