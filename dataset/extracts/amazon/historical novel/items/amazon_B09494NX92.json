Hitler's Army hated everyone that wasn't German and forced some into their hateful army, to do their bidding.This is the story of Tomasz, who is Polish and is forced into the German Army when an attempt to save him from being \"recruited\" fails. It's also the love story if Tomasz and Zophia, a love that endures throughout the war, but isn't meant to be.This story unfolds as Tomasz's grand daughter, Isla, searches for an explanation as to why there is a picture of her grandfather in a German Uniform, being awarded a medal for bravery by the Germans. Isla learns that things are not always as they seem and there are many, many secrets being hidden by her grandfather, who has dementia and is quickly forgetting his story. She makes it her mission to find out the secrets of his past so that they will never be forgotten and in doing so travels to Poland and connects with family members she has never met.I recommend having a box of tissues handy when you get to the end of the book, it had me ugly crying!",

There seems to be an entertaining formula of Paris, Fighters & Bombers & their pilots. Libraries & their mysterious history books pointing to conclusions leading up to the reasons for the wars. Lost loves of the readers time window war whose Grandparents are somehow connected to undercover persons elswhere with lots of money & lost family estates in either Italy or Great Britain who do or don't live in their source land any longer. Then, without judgement or challange, the library of books tightly focusing the reader on the painfully true heavy historical emotion of the War Camps & their types of prisoners & why they were held captives together with their own personal families connections possibly in other parts of the world. Through the reading media of books that we are offered the horrific memories of that time reconnects home today to the reader & the existance of it is stongly reminded of many things from that time & sickeningly now the Ukraine the words of \"Lest We Forget\" will thank goodness never ever terminate.",
