                "reviewText": "To Dream of Shadows tackled an extremely well known and heavily documented subject that is the Holocaust in this engaging story. Steve N. Lee is a wonderful writer and I ate this book up. Truthfully, I have read countless books on the Holocaust and World War 2, both fiction and non-fiction, and I was desperately searching for an exciting and well written story. Truthfully, for every unforgettable literary experience that exists, there are at least 5 maddeningly unreadable books masquerading as \"gripping, heartbreaking, unforgettable\" books destined to be best sellers. Cautiously optimistic when I began this book, but not expecting sparks, I knew after chapter 2 that this book would be a drink of fresh water in my current reading desert. I am honestly thrilled that this book was MUCH BETTER than I was expecting. Not only was it engrossing and well written, it gave me hope that I have not, as I truly despaired, read all the best World War 2 and Holocaust fiction ever written and that I would have to settle for mediocre and stale stories. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I rate most fiction by comparing it to my most beloved and 5 star literary giants that include authors Ken Follett, Alice Hoffman, Simon Seabag Montefiore, and Leigh Bardugo. A rating of one star less than I would give my favorite author, Ken Follett, is a true testament of author, Steve Lee's, ability to create an unforgettable story. And, no, I was not paid to write this review. I just want to give credit where credit is due. Enjoy!",

And have the life they deserve. Or is the plan too flawed? Rudi knows they won't be 'lucky' enough to have a straight forward execution if caught!I thoroughly recommend you read their story.",

I applaud the author for the level of his research throughout the entire book. I thought that I already had my favourite author of holocaust related stories but this has eclipsed it. I can\u2019t recommend this book enough.",
