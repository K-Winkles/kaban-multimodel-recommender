This book fantastically tells a tale of a brother and sister and they evade the Nazis in the Netherlands. They have a sister who has been taken and a father who helps the resistance. My 4th grader, who was pretty apprehensive about reading, flew through this, so it isn't just a good book for adults, but fantastic for children! History is important to know, to learn from, to take the good, and know the bad so we do not repeat it again.",

The cover is beautiful and the love and concern the older brother has for protecting his sister is a strong and touching weave throughout the story. Surely, this will inspire young readers.

                "reviewText": "This is an exciting look back at a time in history when life was hard for everyone\u2013the period of the Hongerwinter, the Dutch famine of 1944-1945 during the time the Netherlands was occupied by Germany, at the end of World War II. I have to admit I did not know much about this part of the war before reading this book, and it has spurred my interest to learn more.Told from the points of view of Dirk, a 13-year-old boy who is trying to find his way to safety with his young sister, Anna, and his older sister Els, who is part of the Resistance and has been captured by the Gestapo, Hunter Winter, shares a snapshot of the dangers and difficulties that people were facing during this time. It\u2019s written simply so a child could understand, but is full of suspense at the same time and kept this grandmother on the edge of her seat wondering how these children would be able to survive\u2026. to the extent that I finished the book in one sitting.There is a Christian message throughout the book; not heavy-handed but enough to show where this family gets its strength. One of the many pieces of advice Dirk\u2019s father had shared with him was \u201cKeep your hopes up and your prayers strong,\u201d and it definitely helped him as he struggled to keep his sister safe.I highly recommend this book to families with children 10 and up. It might be a little much for younger kids, but it\u2019s important that our children learn about times like these so hopefully they\u2019ll know enough to keep history from repeating itself. There are some violent moments, but this was a violent time, so to leave those elements out would have been doing the readers a disservice.The author has obviously put a lot of research into this time period and, until I reached the end of the book and discovered the characters were fictional, I would have sworn the author was telling a story torn out of his own family\u2019s history\u2013the characters were that real to me. Good job, sir.originally posted at long and short reviews",
