                "reviewText": "An intriguing look at the court of one of the royal fiefdoms of Italy in the Renaissance, this novel of a teenage girl\u2019s ill-fated marriage just didn\u2019t grab me. The writing was beautiful and the details richly described, but the story felt flat and bloodless.Despite the book being told from Lucrezia\u2019s perspective, I never felt I got to know her. We learn of her lonely childhood with emotionally distant parents and siblings, her compulsion to paint the natural world around her, her increasing isolation and desperation, but she remained unknowable. The husband and his consiglieri are stock villains, the latter especially so. The loving and helpful maid was another stock character.That said, the scholarship is so exemplary that I found the novel more than worthwhile. I enjoyed learning about Renaissance Italy - Lucrezia was born two years before the death of England\u2019s Henry VIII but the world of Florence and Ferrara seemed quite different from London. I confess I prefer Hilary Mantel\u2019s Thomas Cromwell trilogy to this.Everyone says Hamnet is fabulous so I\u2019ll have to try it, just not right now.",

                "reviewText": "Set in Renaissance Italy during 1560, this is the story of young Lucretia the fifth child of the powerful Cosimo de\u2019 Medici family. When Lucretia was born, she was loud, slept poorly, and was restless. So, her mother had Lucretia moved out of the family nursery away from the four sweet tempered children who might be adversely influenced to behave willfully as this new baby did. A wet nurse and a cook were hired to tend to the infant living in another wing of their opulent home. Because of her upbringing, Lucretia felt like an outcast and different from her brothers and sisters. She was often unnoticed, ran wild, and was thought to be something of a pest. Her brothers and sisters bullied her and her parents were often dismissive of her.When Lucretia was 13, her oldest sister died and Lucretia was informed that she was to take her sister\u2019s place as the betrothed of Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara. At the age of 15, Lucretia and Alfonso were married and quickly departed to his home far away, where she knew no one, did not speak the language, and was considered the property of the man she wed. Alfonso needed one thing from his young wife and that was a male child.But, the charming, attentive Duke was not as charming nor attentive when he was back in his kingdom. Alfonso was a cruel man, but it was his cousin, the Duke\u2019s right hand man, who did the dirty work. As their first year of marriage was ending, the Duke commissioned a marriage portrait of his beautiful duchess to be painted by a famous artist. Alfonso himself would watch every step of the painting so that the final painting would present a duchess who looked suitable and worthy enough to be his wife.The book begins with an historical note about the real Lucretia de\u2019 Medici and ends with the authors interesting notes. The literary license the author used to keep the novel flowing and exciting made for a really good read. Some reviewers felt there were too many redundant descriptive passages but I thought they fit the time period and increased the appeal of the story. I enjoyed the book but did feel the narrative at the ending changed the tone of the book and was a bit abrupt. A four star read for me.",

                "reviewText": "This book follows a young Italian girl who is promised off to be married to a Duke, despite her wishes. We follow her transition from girl to wife and the expectations associated with being a woman, wife, and proper lady in the 1500s. However the plot flashes back and forth on the timeline and the contrast in emotion and storyline is jarring- is the Duke a good man or seditious? This book is a long slow build that turns to a borderline psychological thriller set in luxurious renaissance age Italy.",

                "reviewText": "Maggie O'Farrell is one of my favorite writers, and I will read all of her books. I loved the main character, Lucrezia. She is only ever a child in this story, in a family of 3 sisters and several more brothers. It's heartbreaking that, for some reason, she is the least loved, even though she is probably the most intelligent and talented of all the children. The only three people who truly love her are her milk mother, her milk mother's daughter and the children's nurse, Sofia. She is fiercely independent and a lover of nature, including wildlife. If not for her sister's death, she may have had a longer childhood and, perhaps, a more loving husband. I enjoy reading historical novels on my kindle, as it is so easy to do research as I read by linking to the internet.Not my favorite of her novels, but still outstanding!",

                "reviewText": "Vor ein paar Jahren habe ich Hamnet von Maggie O'Farrell gelesen und war begeistert, obwohl ich mich sonst nicht so sehr f\u00fcr historische Geschichten interessierte. Deswegen wollte ich das neue Buch von der gleichen Autorin The Marriage Portrait lesen. Und wieder hat sie mich in eine fremde Welt mitgenommen, die mich fasziniert hat. Durch ihre Erz\u00e4hlkunst, ihren wunderbaren Stil und detaillierte Beschreibungen lief der Film \u00fcber das Leben der jungen Protagonistin vor meinem geistigen Auge ab. Die Geschichte hat mich gefesselt: ich f\u00fchlte mit der jungen Frau, wollte sie unbedingt retten. Inzwischen habe ich zwei weitere, fr\u00fchere Romane von Maggie O'Farrell gelesen und werde alle anderen auch lesen. Topp Autorin!",

                "reviewTitle": "Captivating tale",
                "reviewText": "The Marriage Portrait is a delicately handled fictional portrait of Lucrezia de Medici. The author weaves a captivating tale into the world of Renaissance Italy. From the very beginning the story plunges into scenes of picturesque descriptions. Each landscape comes alive and I found myself immediately transported to this rich era.The story is inspired by Browning's poem \"My Last Duchess'. I am in total awe of her imagination and the amount of research that she has put into it. The author emphasises the role of women, the ugly side of the royal life; urgency of an heir, the suppression of the poor. Other themes like loneliness, relationships, literature, art, music during that time.I especially enjoyed the vivid colours and descriptions of paintings, portraits and the hidden mysterious elements in it. There was so much to take back from this story. Every time I highlighted lines it left me smiling and only growing hungrier for more.The author has a unique style of storytelling that echoes of Charles Dickens style. Layered with intense complex characters the tale delivers powerful, thought provoking dialogues with as much finesse. Not once does the pace slacken or lose track of tale.I loved every bit of the imagery be it the castles, churches, garden even the animals mentioned had an aura of their own. After reading the Hamnet, I had high expectations from this tale and it never once faltered. If you love a good literary fiction, don't miss out on this one.",
