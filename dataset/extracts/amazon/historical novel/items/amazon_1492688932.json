                "reviewText": "This arrived for me to review a few days ago and I only just got around to reading it now. However, my ten year old son picked it up yesterday afternoon and started reading it. He was absolutely engrossed. He said: 'Mum, it's good...well, not good, but...powerful.' We read it together today and I answered his questions and we discussed the stories in the book and thought about what we would do in those situations. The graphics are amazing, the stories are beautifully told and the book is of the highest quality. Great reading list, time line, synopsis and wonderful photos of the real life people the stories are about. It is destined to be a classic and deservedly so.",

Every school and every child should have access to these stories so that they can remember the Holocaust and ensure it never happens again.The stories are really moving. They are told with the simplest of pictures, and simple block capital letters but such heart breaking stories of human courage.",
