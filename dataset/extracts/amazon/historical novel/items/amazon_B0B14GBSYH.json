                "reviewText": "I just finished All The Broken Places by John Boyne. If a book can be disturbing and riveting all at the same time, it would describe this piece of historical fiction perfectly. This novel is the continuation of the story, The Boy in The Striped Pajamas. However, it primarily centers on Bruno's sister Gretel, and gives details of what happened to her and her family after the war. Like other historical fiction novels, this too alternated between past and present, a clever way to entice the reader to keep turning pages.I don't want to give too much away in regards to the plot, but what I will say is I had great difficulty liking the main character Gretel, a sign she was well written. At times I had to walk away from the novel because Gretel made me angry and my head spun. She was often self-absorbed and in great denial of the horrors the Nazi Party had created, and then just as quickly would be overcome with guilt and fear of others finding out about her, or her family's past. As the years go by, Gretel matures and appears to accept her family's guilt, while attempting to put the past behind her. But all dark secrets have a way of catching up as she will find in the most unpleasant way.All The Broken Places is very well written, as all John Boyne books tend to be. There are twists and turns in the story that I never anticipated and the ending was a bit of a shock, although I should have seen it coming. This novel was a great way to both continue and end the story of The Boy in The Striped Pajamas.",

Her father was hanged when she was 12, she and her mother escaped to France with a new identity. After a few years there, Gretel went to Australia, but she soon decided to come back to Europe and lived in England where she got maried and had a child.\u2b50\ufe0f Excellent book. Extremely well written, with this amazing capacity of the author to make everything clear. Should a 12 year-old be hold responsible for the actions of her father? How do you live with the fact that your father killed tens of thousand of people? Guilt, redemption, resilience, fear, love.\u2b50\ufe0f@miss_books_isa",
