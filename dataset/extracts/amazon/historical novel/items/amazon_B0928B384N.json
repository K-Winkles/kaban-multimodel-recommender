                "reviewText": "I must admit a certain prejudice when men write female characters. Too often, they are Mary Sue's of one flavor or another. In Cheng he gave us no golden hearted whore whose beauty causes fish to down themselves. Neither did he give us a woman too impossibly clever to be real. Nor a woman that is actually a man simply clothed in female gender. Cheng is quite pretty, reasonably intelligent, and has a will of IRON. And it is that quality... force of personality, force of will, sheer bloody minded perseverance that makes her the pirate queen. This is one hundred percent a character driven story and what a character!!!! You watch her grow, change, make mistakes, learn, make mistakes again and ultimately succeed. Despite her poor sewing skills she managed to create a whole cloth, tough if not overly beautiful, from the rags and tatters life throws her in an ancient culture steeped in misogyny.And let's talk about an ancient culture. Chinese pirates???? Never heard of them. And the author brought it to LIFE. I'm inspired to learn more about this period in japanese maritime history. Absolutely FASCINATING. Warning.... this book is not for the faint at heart. Although never gratuitous or prurient in nature the author does not spare you the.....traumas.... of being a flower boat girl...or a pirate. He doesn't spare you the indignities of being a woman in a society with very little respect for women aside from their child bearing potential and skills in a bedroom or a kitchen. Your heart will bleed. Even if Chengs doesn't. Far from the plucky heroine she's more the practical, pragmatic, hearty flower with long thorns. Check it out. You're quite unlikely to regret this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Not sure how The Flower Boat Girl showed up in my search for an ebook copy of War and Peace so I could make my umpteenth attempt to read Tolstoy\u2019s work, but I am so very glad it did. I\u2019d never heard of Zheng Yi Sao, aka Ching Shih, (Shek Yang, later Cheng Yat Sou in the book because author Larry Feign uses the Cantonese versions of her names rather than the transliterated Mandarin which is standard in the West) but she was sold into prostitution, captured by pirates, forced to marry one, yet became the most successful and powerful pirate who ever lived. No, seriously: Blackbeard, Captain Kid, Sir Henry Morgan\u2026 rank amateurs compared to Madam Cheng. This book covers the time of her capture and first, forced, marriage to pirate captain Zheng Yi (Cheng Yat).Feign, who has lived in Hong Kong for years does an excellent job of bringing her story to vivid life with evocative prose and a lively narrative style. He\u2019s done his research and seamlessly creates the world of the pirates of the South China seas in the opening years of the nineteenth century in which to immerse his readers. The novel hits the ground running, opening with the raid in which Shek Yang is captured. She is no wilting maiden or damsel in distress: she\u2019s a scrappy fighter which attracts Cheng Yat\u2019s interest, and has him instantly declare he\u2019s taking her to wife. The fact that she\u2019s beautiful doesn\u2019t hurt. More importantly, she\u2019s also very smart, and something of a visionary. She\u2019s not thrilled with this marriage, but does come to terms with it and develops some affection for her husband. Better: their relationship develops into a partnership of mutual respect. Not without its arguments and rough spots, but still. By the end of it all, she has made her husband a rich man, and supreme commander of a federation of pirate fleets.I enjoyed The Flower Boat Girl a lot. As soon as I finished it, I signed up for the free copy of an omitted chapter. I eagerly await the sequel about the next years of Ching Shih\u2019s life which, according to the histories I've searched out since buying this book, were even more exciting than the ones detailed here.",

                "reviewText": "I got this book after listening to a CHP author interview. Feign makes the character likeable and sympathetic. In grungy reality, she would have been more alien, much more terrifying. Much more like one of Tarantino's Resevoir Dogs. The horrors are kept to a minimum: one mutilation, some tormented Englishmen, and offstage disemboweling. These greasy, stinking bloody scenes, which would have been pretty common considering the nature of this \"business,\" give way to lovingly detailed scenes of women shopping for fancy soap and of fish flipping in the moonlight to the delight of lovers out for a romantic evening floating along on a boat built for two. I kept waiting for this queen to light a Yankee candle. So long as you accept from the outset that what is in this book has nothing to do with the dirty reality of actual history, you can have a good time reading it. These people were, in truth, stone cold killers. That was their stock and trade, a point Tunghoi Bat reminds us of at the end of the book. But he is an old fashioned \"scum of the sea\" and doesn't belong in this first decade of the 19th century strangely reimagined in terms of 21st-century liberalism. He is so 18th century, man!",

                "reviewText": "I first heard about this Chinese pirate who started out life as a prostitute flower boat girl on a Radio 4 documentary. Having never heard of her before I read the recommended book which was apparently based on facts and fascinating. Every bit as powerful as Gengis Khan or Napoleon and yet, as a woman, her story was buried in history. Testament how, despite lip service to the contrary, we still live in a misogynist world!!",

The story of the pirate queen is meticulously researched, brilliantly described and presented as a real rip-snorter of a novel. He promises a follow-up volume and I will be on the doorsep to buy the fitst coppy off the press.",
