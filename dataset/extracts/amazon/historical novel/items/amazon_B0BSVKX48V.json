Heroes and villains, curmudgeons, and generous souls.This book would be a wonderful choice for book clubs and will be among my top 20 list of most enjoyable reads.",

                "reviewText": "This book tells two stories: In the present day it tells the story of Gwen who has suffered the heartbreaking loss of a baby that subsequently ended her marriage and Valerie, who later became a famous movie star and song writer who lived in Alaska during the big earthquake of 1964. Both stories were beautifully told and unfolded in such a way that I couldn't put the book down. I loved Gwen and Valerie and cried at times as I read about their lives and their heartbreak. The supporting characters were also richly drawn and two of them were brought from 1964 Alaska to the present day where they completed the story of Valerie. This book was beautifully written with both stories complimenting one another.This is the first book that I have read by this author and I will be reading more of her work in the future.",

                "reviewText": "Julianne has, once again, written a story that reminds us that life is only a journey, and that, sometimes, we learn from others.She runs parallel stories seamlessly. If anything this story reminded me that there are no coincidences in life; every step, every encounter, every truth discovered, are only leads to a better place, to a place of healing, to a new perspective, and wiser choices. Gwen and Peter grow during this truth seeking journey about an artist whose life choices defied the norms of her time. Over all, it is a story of healing from losses and of growth, and this is what I like the most about Julianne's novels. They are not mere entertaining stories. They come with tidbits of wisdom, and plenty of worthy reminders.Thank you Julianne.",
