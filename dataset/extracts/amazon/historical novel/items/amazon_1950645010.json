All the major characters (and a few of the minor ones) were expertly fleshed out and I found myself caring for a lot of them (the heroes) and sad that I will not be able to read any more about them. The author obviously painstakingly researched this era and location in order to create an authentic narrative which was engaging, informative for the reader and (sadly) parallels some of the troubles that afflict the same region today. I felt like I learned a lot about this important and complex period and feel more sympathy for the same area today.",

I especially appreciate the variety of main characters-peaceful Jewish believers, extremists, sympathetic non-Jews, those in the ruling classes, soldiers, etc. It allowed me to see of point of view from many sides.The layout of the temple and the region is so well done, making the story easier to follow. There is so much happening and the author makes it easy to imagine. While I may want to know history, non-fiction formats don't work well for me; books like this make it come alive and stick in the brain!",

I\u2019m a little bummed I can\u2019t find anything else by Sanford. Hopefully this won\u2019t be the last thing he writes.",

Well-researched and described as if the author had personal experience in the time and places. He paints the settings in great detail, making it easy to picture the action. This detail does slow the story, but this is not a quick light read, but rather a look at the powers and influences at play while told in the context of a fiction story. In the genre of historical fiction, it leans heavier on the \"historical\" than the \"fiction\".Character development was spot on. I appreciated the growth that was discernable in several of the main players.I'm looking forward to the second book.",
