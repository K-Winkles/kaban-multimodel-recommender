                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Almost Perfect, but Lacks Depth and Detail",
                "reviewText": "There are certain facts we know about Edward VIII, the king who abdicated: for example, Wallis Simpson was not the first time he\u2019d had an affair with someone not considered suitable to be his wife. And, as far as anyone knows, he didn\u2019t have any children with Wallis or any other woman. I could, therefore, reasonably perceive that Cleo would not turn out to be his illegitimate daughter in this novel by Christine Wells before I read the first page.So, if The Royal Windsor Secret wasn\u2019t going to end in a father and daughter reunion, what was it all about? What made me give it four and a half stars?This is an homage to colonial Egypt, which finishes the day the hotel is destroyed. It\u2019s Cleo\u2019s home, a place she yearns to return to despite years of living elsewhere. The book starts (after a prologue) and ends at Shepheard\u2019s. As her life changes, so does life at the hotel. It\u2019s where she meets Brodie, the Scottish boy sent there to live with a relative after his parents are killed. Disowned by his grandfather, he\u2019s treated by some of the residents, including Cleo\u2019s governess, as little more than a servant. It\u2019s also, therefore, a love story as they grow up and their friendship evolves into something else. The semi-fictional story regarding Edward VIII and his former mistress, Marguerite, is woven throughout, along with the love of jewelry that Cleo, Wallis, and Marguerite share. But when does love become obsession?If there\u2019s one disappointment I had with this book, it\u2019s that it felt very shallow on occasion, and there are gaps in the timeline. I was a quarter of the way through it before I realized. I would\u2019ve loved more detail, such as how Cleo adjusted to living in England and more of what she did before World War II. What was the mood like when war was declared? Nor did I really feel the sense of emergency when British forces were trying to leave Cairo ahead of Rommel\u2019s arrival.I\u2019m a harsh marker when it comes to giving stars in a book review. At one point, I had decided The Royal Windsor Secret was only going to receive three stars and I was wondering how to inform the blog tour organizer of which I was part. The lack of depth was a major reason. But I stuck with it, and I urge you to do so as well. Because there\u2019s a very satisfying payoff, right in those final pages. Yes, I would\u2019ve liked an epilogue consisting of a look at Cairo post British rule (did Cleo return?), but I can live without it.Disclaimer: Although I received an electronic copy of this book from the publisher, via Random Things Tours, the opinions above are my own.",

They are some of the most formative years of her life as she is starting out and becoming an adult in the eyes of society. This book tells the years beautifully and keeps in touch with what would have happened during that time in history. At the end of the book the authors note explains where the inspirations came from and what was more real than fiction. I was fascinated by the entire story. It has strong women, family emotions, and excellent settings. If you are interested in historical fiction, especially centered around the Royal Family, this is a book for you.",

                "reviewText": "Cairo, Egypt 1935: Cleo Davenport, 16 years old, enjoys a life of freedom with her adopted Aunt Serafina and her friend Brodie. Freedom, until her Aunt Serafina gives in to her sister and brother-in-law, Lord and Lady Grayson, when they decide it is time for Cleo to leave Cairo and go with them to London to prepare for her debut into society and presentation to the King, Edward VIII.Left on a doorstep in Cairo as a baby and not knowing her real parentage, Cleo has long lived with the whispers that her real father is none other than the Prince of Wales, now the King. Having no time for ballrooms and debuts, Cleo has the dream of one day designing her own range of jewelry for Cartier.After the King's abdication, Cleo travels to France to follow up on her dream as a designer and also to try to discover her real parentage. Her search takes a shocking turn into the world of the Parisian demimonde and a high-class courtesan, Marguerite Meller.This story takes place between 1934 and 1952 with back stories to 1914, the WWI years and the 1920s.With a mixture of real people and fiction characters, here is insight (though fictional) into the incredible life of Edward and Wallis, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and I very much enjoyed the interaction between the characters as written by an Author whose work I love.Interesting to learn from the Author's note that the SAS was practically born at the Long Bar at Shepheard's Hotel in Cairo.Very well done, Christine Wells, this story is a winner for me, I loved it.I highly recommend this story and all of Christine's stories to other readers.",
