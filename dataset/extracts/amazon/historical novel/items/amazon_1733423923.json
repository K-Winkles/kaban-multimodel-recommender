                "reviewText": "I read this book with my twelve year old daughter, and we were both captivated by Anna's coming-of-age journey. This book weaves together many interesting perspectives and gives a very non-romanticized accounting of the limited options for women in the late 19th Century as well as the deep racism that white settlers held for the Native peoples of the Puget Sound. Anna's struggle to find her own truth despite the messages that she receives from both her family and society at large feels authentic and also welcome. My daughter and I had some great conversations as a result of reading about the things Anna was experiencing.McGillen does a great job with setting, both in terms of time period and location. It was easy to picture myself in the story, experiencing post-fire Seattle and wondering how we would make it through winter. I would recommend this book especially to people who love the Laura Ingalls books. Anna embodies the independent, pioneering spirit, but she also offers a more nuanced look at what it would have been like to be a smart, determined and capable young woman in society where that wasn't particularly desired and yet was simultaneously changing rapidly.",

I enjoyed the young woman's bravery, goals, eagerness to learn, friendliness, especially with the indigenous woman. She knows what life she wants, the kind of man she wants as a husband. I really enjoyed learning the back story of the riddle she solves, what happened to treasure, and how she made money. Very interesting story!",

There is not a thing wrong with doing that as long as it is a woman's preference. However, it is not the preference of every woman. Anna was a brave, determined young woman and was willing to risk everything to live out her dream. I wish I'd had that kind of determination and not been so afraid to venture far from the \" nest\". My life would have been so much richer and I would not have made so many critical mistakes! I can only applaud Anna's efforts to become who she really was. I highly recommend this book!",
