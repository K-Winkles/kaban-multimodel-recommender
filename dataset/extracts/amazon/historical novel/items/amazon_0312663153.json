The research and care in the storytelling made it a page-turner for me. As a matter of fact I stayed up all of last night reading and waiting to solve the mystery of Vera. I started the book by listening on Audible but finished by reading it on Kindle. This gave me time to digest everything that I had just read. On reading the author\u2019s notes at the end I realized that Kristin Hannah spent so much time and care telling this story and I am so glad she did. The character development for the main three women was well developed. I suggest reading the author\u2019s notes as to why she ended the book as she did. I also appreciated the recipes included in the afterward. Thank you for this novel, Ms. Hannah. It will stay with me for a long time.",

What a truly amazing story \u2014 one that I will think about often.Wonderful. JUST wonderful.",

I love historical fictions. Especially in World War II. this is probably my third historical fiction with the protagonist viewpoint from a Russian side. it is so easy to sympathize with those in England, Poland, Italy, America during World War III, but rarely do we see anything regarding Russia.My eyes have been open to a whole different side. truthfully, I was very much annoyed with Meredith and I couldn\u2019t understand Anya. Anya, was very much a cold, stereotypical Russian woman. But I loved how the stories unfolded between Anya and Meredith and even Nina. The story gets better near the end. my heart broke my eyes teared up and yet I had a slight bit of joy at the end. Was this my favorite book ever? No. I truly wish there was more of a happy ending. But i am so glad i read this book.",

                "reviewText": "Another compelling book by Kristin Hannah. I had difficulty putting it down. I am always reluctant to read a \"dual timeline\" story since so few authors do it well, but Kristin Hannah excels at this style. She keeps her characters at a minimum and her timeframes a reasonable number of decades apart so the story is nicely and believably tied up at the end.While I wasn't enamored with the current-day daughters; their emotionally vacant upbringing was believable enough to explain their personalities. The mom's story was heart breakingly told thanks to all the research the author did on the atrocities during the Siege of Leningrad and the decade earlier Great Purge under Stalin's leadership. I appreciated the uplifting ending.I did read some of the reviews and was saddened at the number of people who know nothing about this period in world history. Not just the atrocities of WWII, but the devastating effects of Stalinism in Russia the decades prior. Hopefully this book will encourage readers to learn more.",
