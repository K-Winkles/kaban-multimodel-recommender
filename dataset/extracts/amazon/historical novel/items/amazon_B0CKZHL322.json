        "description": "1945, Auschwitz: I stumble out of the gates, tightly grasping the hands of two smaller children. Hunger swirls in my stomach and the barren landscape swims before my eyes. I can barely believe it. We\u2019re free. We survived. But what happens now\u2026Sixteen-year-old Tasha Ancel turns to take one last look at the imposing place that stole her freedom and her childhood. She has no idea how she continued to live when so many others did not. For the first time in months, her heart beats with hope for her future and that of the smaller children who cling to her now.Tasha was torn from her mother\u2019s arms by an SS guard days before the gates of Auschwitz opened. Now she only has a lock of her mother\u2019s fiery hair. Desperate to be reunited, Tasha asks everyone she meets if they\u2019ve seen a woman with flame-red hair. But with so many people trying to locate their loved ones in the chaotic aftermath of war finding her feels like an impossible task.Officially an orphan, Tasha is given the chance to start a new life in the Lake District in England. She knows her mother would want her to take the opportunity but she can\u2019t bear the thought of leaving Poland without her.Tasha must make a heartbreaking decision: will she stay in war-ravaged Europe and cling on to the hope that the person she loves most in the world is alive, or take a long journey across the sea towards an uncertain future?An absolutely unputdownable and heart-wrenching WW2 story of survival against all odds and learning to live and love again.
