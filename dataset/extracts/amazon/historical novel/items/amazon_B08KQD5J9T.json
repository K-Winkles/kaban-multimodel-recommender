                "reviewText": "This is an ambitious take on the life of one of the greatest matriarchs in history. Dorothy Kirwan's journey from an abused enslaved girl to one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in the Caribbean is a story we all should be aware of.The story spans 63 years and the time jumps between chapters can be disorienting to the reader. I think writing it this was is a natural consequence of such an massive project. The author tries to mention details to keep the reader centered on WHEN they are in the story but I still found myself flipping back to the title of the previous chapter to remind myself how many years had passed.My favourite thing form this read is the rich history is pay tribute to and how immersed in the time period the writing makes you feel. Prepare to historical figures imagined to life ranging from leaders of rebellions to future Kings of England.My biggest criticism is that I wished this read focused a little more on the work Dorothy, or \"Dolly\", did to achieve her success and a little less on the loves she had in her lifetime. Her love and devotion to her family and how far she'd go for them is the true love story in this novel. Be prepared for genuine tear jerking moments.",

                "reviewText": "trigger warnings: incest, child death, rapeMy relationship with this book is quite complicated. I was extremely excited to read this book, but it left me feeling somewhat flat. The story itself was fascinating, one that I feel needed to be told. But although I love a long book done well, this felt somehow both too much and too little at the same time. The \u201ctoo much\u201d comes from the fact that there were many parts that felt more like filler than moments that really added to the story. The \u201ctoo little\u201d came from the rather vignette-style chapters. They were often rather short, a snapshot of a moment, over before I could really get to know the characters within. This wasn\u2019t helped by the lack of many time markers, beyond a general year. I felt as if I never truly got to know Dolly (aka Dorothy), nor the large cast of characters in her life that were important.And that is a shame as Dorothy Kirwan Thomas was a powerful and influential woman of color who was driven to succeed in a world and time that didn\u2019t want that to happen. She was extraordinary, both as a woman in a world dominated by men, but more importantly as a person of color. She was driven, ambitious, and incredibly inspiring.It also felt as if there was often too much attention paid to the intricacies of Dolly\u2019s romances. They were important to her story, of course, but it felt as if the focus on them came at the expanse of pushing the story of her way to freedom and success to the side. And that was the part I wanted to know more about. It felt almost disrespectful to reduce her story to that of her relationships with men, as if her interactions were the most important thing about who she was.All of that being said, there were some incredibly poignant moments, moments that really made me think. Here are a few quotes that really stuck out to me. Some because they were eye-opening, some because they are profoundly true, some that spole to me as a woman.-The white man wants to blame his sins on colored women. His depravity is our fault. If we take the abuse just to live another day, they say we are the seducers. They write the history.-A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right.-If not for Charlotte, I\u2019d turn around and pretend I didn\u2019t see this, how free colored fell into the ways of owning folks just like the whites.-Somewhere on my journey, I started to love me. I won\u2019t ever stop. My girls needed to love themselves, too, and to believe they were worthy of their dreams.",

                "reviewText": "This historical story on Dorothy Kirwan Thomas was very well written. If you love historical novels, I do, on Black peoples lives in the 1700 and 1800's, then this is a must read! Loved the details Vanessa Riley gave us on how Dorothy grew her wealth even among the horrible obstacles of slavery. How and why she had to own slaves because the white man continued putting obstacles in her way trying to keep her from succeeding in building her hotels with man power to do it!! She did not want ownership of slaves, but she taught them how to work toward their freedom by saving their earnings to buy their freedom! Yes, she paid her slaves!! She did what she had to.Her observations in her travels were amazing because she brought back what she learned and incorporated them in her businesses which helped her prosper even more! Loved her intelligence, her strength, her love of family and how she helped them all. She was a teacher in her own right, training her housekeepers on how she expected them to clean the white folks homes. How she taught her children to run her businesses was so smart because she was determined to make sure they knew how to survive during that time.I can go on and on, but I will let you find out for yourself what a STRONG BLACK WOMAN can do with sheer determination. I recommend this book highly. Thank you Vanessa for this book. I loved \ud83d\ude0d \u2665 it.",

I\u2019m a fan of Vanessa Riley\u2019s romances, so was daunted when I saw it was over 500 pages \u2013 but her writing is so smooth and clear, her storytelling so compelling. I whizzed through it in just a few days. Island Queen is based on the true-life story of Dorothy Kirwan Thomas, it\u2019s rich with historical detail and deeply atmospheric. This lively account of her fascinating and inspirational life is the narrative of the C18th I\u2019ve been longing for, bravo Vanessa Riley!",
