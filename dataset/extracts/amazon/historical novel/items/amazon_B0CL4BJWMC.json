Those did not keep me from thoroughly enjoying this book. Carol Colyer always writes a good tale, and this is one of her finest. The only thing that bothered me was in the extended story. The names of Mathew and Wes were changed. We did not find out what Jericho was doing or how Gabriel's parents were accepting Ava as their new daughter-in-law and if they had met her yet. The name of the head of the orphanage was also changed. This shows poor editing for not catching these errors. Overall though the book was wonderful to read, and I highly recommend it to everyone.",

His background was extremely different from hers (my only disappoint with the story was nothing was ever said about how his family dealt with/and or communicated with them as the story is resolved). There are many twists and characters are not what you might expect. Both Ava and Gabriel are very loyal to those that are their friends. Well worth the read!",
