The characters in this book were well developed, and I especially loved the fact that we are reading about a real historical figure, with fictional embellishments and creative license taken due to lack of recorded historical facts. I felt the author did a wonderful job portraying Susanna and giving us all a realistic historical review about the time period and the area in which the story takes place.It was a very enjoyable read, and I finished it in two short sittings because I simply could not put it down.This delightful and inspirational story was a lighthearted yet important account of important events in American history- a pleasure for the intended age group, and adults alike\u2026 Huzzah to author Libby Carty McNamee on your first published book! Looking forward to reading Dolley Madison next.",

                "reviewText": "I met the author of this charming book via Revolutionary War circles on FB, and this led me to pick up a copy on Amazon, since I have been binge-reading revolutionary fiction while writing my own revolutionary trilogy. This particular story deals with wartime experiences on the home front through the eyes of a teenaged girl, Susanna. She is living out the day-to-day of the waiting and watching part of war, as her brothers are off fighting for what often seems to be a lost cause. The author does a very good job dealing with the tension of waiting for the casualty lists to come in, and then even if your own loved ones are not on them, having to face neighbors whose loved ones will never be coming home. There is a particularly realistic scene of Susanna not having the heart to tell a neighbor that she has seen her son listed among the slain, and runs away, leaving the poor woman to find out herself. We also get to see the bitter divides within communities between Patriots and Loyalists, which manifests even at funeral services. The plot picks up pace when Lord Cornwallis and his regulars comes to town, resulting in Susanna finding herself a necessary component to keeping the revolutionary cause afloat by preventing the capture of the Marquis de Lafayette. I appreciated that the author referenced Cornwallis having just lost his beloved wife Jemima, which parallels the loss of Susannah's father. I rather wished this commonality could have been explored further and we could have fleshed out more about Cornwallis, not only in terms of his family life and tragedies, but also the fact that he started out as being quite sympathetic to colonial complaints in parliament and deeply regretted the necessity for the war at all, considering Americans to be his brethren and this entire scenario to be a civil war. It could have been interesting to see Susanna's own reaction to these layers to Cornwallis' character. I also rather wish we got more scenes with Tarleton, who was apparently wounded and staying in a bedroom of their home, which of course would cause quite the stir given his hardcore reputation and massacre potential. But aside from my daydreaming about plot expansion here and there, I quite enjoyed going along for the ride (pun totally intended) with Susanna. It brought back fond memories of growing up with the American Girl series. Felicity was always my favorite character (I still have her doll!), and Susanna's spunk reminded me greatly of her. I am also grateful to have learned about a real historical character who I only had an extremely passing knowledge of. I hope the author writes more books along this line, covering little-known heroic women from history! I know she has already written one on Dolly Madison, which I look forward to reading upcoming!",

McNamee brings Susanna Bolling's story to life in a brilliant way. One of my favorite aspects of the book is how she supplements historical accounts with handwritten letters between her characters. This mechanism transports readers back to colonial times and helps connect the bigger story to individual lives.

Pre-teens and up will most likely enjoy this book, especially young girls, as it's based on a true story of a young girl during the Revolutionary War. Our book club met via a Zoom meeting, and the author, Libby Carty McNamee. What a wonderful experience to hear from her and be able to ask questions. And now I'm looking forward to reading her second novel \"Dolley Madison and the War of 1812\". (Yes, Dolley is spelled correctly)Review by Susan",

                "reviewText": "This review is from my daughter, she loved the book.Susanna's Midnight Ride is a brilliant book filled with excitement and intrigue. I am an 11 year old girl and I think it should be a 9+ only because it is filled with lots of descriptive writing so reading ages underneath may not understand some of the words in the book. I really liked this book because I could feel the same emotions the characters could and I learnt a lot more about the revolutionary war without realising it. Susanna's midnight ride is now one of my all time favourite books and once I started reading it I couldn't put it down even if it was my bedtime. That's why I gave it 5 stars. :] :D",
