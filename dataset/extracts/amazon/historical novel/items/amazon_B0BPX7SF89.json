Each section varies in both content and style. The prose is beautifully written, but I also appreciate that there is a deep sense of humor underlying the emotional and expressive language.Initially I was dismayed when the spiritual elements were first introduced, about halfway through the book, but I came to appreciate that aspect of the story as I continued with the book.This book reminds me in many ways of the 2017 film by David Lowery entitled \u2018A Ghost Story\u2019 (not to be confused with the 1990 film \u2018Ghost\u2019) that I found extremely powerful.Five (brilliant) Stars!",

                "reviewText": "North Woods by Daniel Mason is a highly inventive and expansive work of fiction that encompasses centuries and a variety of people who live or inhabit a piece of Massachusetts/ Vermont land. The characters change the land and the land changes them in unusual ways. First, there is the Puritan couple who eschew the religious lifestyle and make a home in the north woods. Then the British soldier who finds his true passion in apple farming. His odd daughters follow him. And so on until the present day.The author uses different genres to tell the land's story. He uses journal entries, poems and songs, journalistic stories, and speeches to guide the reader. Although I sometimes felt it was tedious to use different styles of writing to advance the plot, it was worth it to wade through the narrative. However, straightforward storytelling would have worked also. The characters were unique, sometimes odd, and always interesting. And the end ties the narrative together in a tight bow. This is a book worth reading.",

                "reviewText": "My favorite books are a mixture of arty and plot driven. Not many people can pull that off. Mason has done just that with North Woods. I saw a previous review comparing the book to another of my favorites - Lincoln in the Bardo. The books do have a similar feel. But North Woods is on another level. \u201cFeel\u201d is a good word for North Woods. It made me feel something rare as I read it - like revisiting places I know but have never been. It is utterly stirring and has stayed with me since finishing it. I rarely, if ever, read the same book twice. I found myself re-reading chapters of North Woods after I finished them. Not so much because they were difficult to understand, but because I wanted to simply experience them again. And make certain I hadn\u2019t missed anything. North Woods feels like art but not in a contrived way. I feel like Mason is painting something like a Whistler Nocturne. There isn\u2019t a traditional novel hero / protagonist driving the story. The hero is a house. Just like the figures are fleeting in a Whistler Nocturne, the characters in North Woods are not deeply developed so you can see differently a tale of time. There are moments of beauty in this novel that I rarely ever come across. It has realigned my mind.",

However, while the characters in the story were varied and unique in looks and actions, they were one dimensional. I believe that was possibly the author\u2019s intent to not have them be more than the unique layering of the history of the location, the house, but I was never able to become engrossed in the story. The book was very well written and mildly interesting, for me.",

They reappear at key moments, as supernatural entities. One even manages, after being dead for more than a century, to start over again in a whole new line of work, this time going door to door, repairing... broken septic systems! Huh? It makes no sense.Unless you see it all as a kind of metaphor. Perhaps for a book, which has as many different lives as readers, just as a house may have many inhabitants over its lifetime.Or maybe a metaphor for the author. Who, as it turns out, is ALSO... an assistant professor in the Stanford University Department of Psychiatry. A whole other line of work, repairing... broken septic systems!",

Two small errors an alert editor should have caught - the term 'shotgun' instead of 'scatter gun' or 'musket' for the mid-1770s, and later in the book the police had 'German shepherds' that a page later were called 'hounds'. But what historical novel does not have some errors? The author's portrayal of the changes to the Massachusetts landscape were as disturbing as are the changes to my rural Idaho valley I've observed over the past 75 years. May the reading public get the message.Karen CharbonneauAuthor of Marble Creek, et al",

                "reviewText": "I started North Woods with very little idea of what it was about, barring the typically vague synopsis on the back. Good choice: right from the start, it is arrestingly well written, with wonderfully readable but beautifully descriptive prose, plus an occasional good eye for a gag. Fundamentally it is a selection of short stories centred on a yellow house in the woods of Massachusetts, using the lives, triumphs and disasters of people who lived in it or somehow came within its orbit, to address multiple themes. Beneath the surface level of human character development though, it is overwhelmingly about the environment, about trees, and about how mankind interacts with that environment, for good or ill. I'm not generally a short story fan, but the author has created a wonderfully rich set of characters, and his descriptions of the house and its ever-changing face and uses are stunningly good - and there are always connections, some very surprising, some which will have you leafing back to remember who did what.North Woods is great from start to finish, but I felt it got better and better as it progressed - probably because the connections start to be clearer - and the last section is achingly beautiful in both prose and subject matter with an ending that I found myself re-reading immediately.One of the best novels I have read in some time.",
