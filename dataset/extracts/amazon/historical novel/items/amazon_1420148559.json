                "reviewText": "When Fletcher \u201cGrey\u201d Pryde, Duke of Greycourt\u2019s cousin Vanessa comes to visit him he learns two things, one his aunt is still intent on him marrying Vanessa, much to his and Vanessa\u2019s disgust and two his mother has been widowed yet again. At his mothers\u2019 request, he immediately leaves London and heads out to Armitage Hall.Beatrice Wolfe, is cousin to Sheridan Wolfe, the new Duke of Armitage. She is at the hall helping with the funeral arrangements for her uncle Maurice when Grey arrives and immediately sets her temper off. For his part, Grey is intrigued by the plain speaking Beatrice and would love to argue with her, but he needs to see his mother and get some answers from Sheridan. Beatrice and her brother Joshua live in the dower house, they were orphaned when Beatrice was only 10 and they were taken in by her grandparents, soon after Joshua joined the army and only returned a few years ago, injured and much changed. Beatrice had tried to be helpful to her aunt Lydia (Grey\u2019s mom) and the duchess has decided that Beatrice needs a season and Beatrice hopes to find a husband and finally some security in her life. She is surprised by her reaction to Grey, but is cautious, she has heard rumors of his debauched life and knows better than to pine after a man so far above her in station.His mother is overcome with grief and very happy to see Grey, she wasn\u2019t sure he would come as he has ignored his family in the months since they returned to England from Prussia. His step-father was an ambassador in Prussia and only returned to London when his brother \u201cArmie\u201d died and he inherited the duchy. His mother was married three times and had five children, three of her sons are dukes \u2013 Grey, the Duke of Greycourt is her eldest, Marlowe is the Duke of Thornstock and Sheridan is now the Duke of Armitage, she also has a daughter Gwyn (Marlowe\u2019s twin) and Heywood (Sheridan\u2019s younger brother) \u2013 with the exception of Heywood who is in the military, they are all at Armitage for the funeral. Grey is happy to see his siblings, but is guarded, he left Prussia when he was only ten to go live with his aunt and uncle in England and the experience left him changed, he doesn\u2019t want love, as it has only ever caused him pain and as much as he would like to embrace his family, his past holds him back. He soon learns that Sheridan doesn\u2019t believe Maurice\u2019s death was an accident and thinks that Beatrice\u2019s brother Joshua killed not only him, but possibly Armie as well. He wants Grey to investigate Joshua, but Grey argues that he would probably get more answers from Beatrice \u2013 especially since their mother is grooming her and Gwyn for a debut, Grey says he would get more information helping their mother prepare the girls as he is familiar with the London season.I really enjoyed this story, yes, there are a lot of characters and yes, there is a lot going on, but it is really well done and even with the multitude of characters, it stays on point and Beatrice and Grey are definitely forefront in the story. I loved watching them fall in love and slowly overcome the hurts of their past and learn to trust each other, even when things are not what they seem. The book is filled with witty dialogue, secrets, heartache, steamy love scenes, mystery and a very hard won HEA. The book nicely sets up the series with hints of the other siblings backstories as well as the ongoing mystery of Maurice\u2019s death. I am happy to recommend this book and am eagerly awaiting the next story!!*I am voluntarily leaving a review for an eARC that was provided to me by NetGalley and the publisher.*",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed the story of Beatrice and Fletcher, although he's referred to as Grey through out the story. I did get lost in the relationships, though. He's got 4 half siblings, and Vanessa is his cousin but not theirs, so it must be on his father's side. But I wasn't sure about how Beatrice is or is not related. The story states Maurice is her uncle but if it said how I missed it, cause the author was clear these two were not related. But an interesting theory that someone is killing off Grey's mother's husbands. I assume we'll get more as the series continues.",
