As an avid reader of historical fiction, I was truly captivated by this well-crafted and thought-provoking graphic novel.What struck me immediately was the beautiful artwork that effortlessly brought the story to life. The illustrations were vivid, detailed, and emotionally evocative, perfectly complementing the powerful narrative. The graphic novel format not only added a visual appeal but also made the story more accessible to a wider audience.The story is centered around young Mark, a Jewish boy living in France during the Nazi occupation in 1944. The author, Lauren Tarshis, skillfully weaves together historical facts with a gripping fictional narrative. Through Mark's eyes, we witness his struggle for survival, his resilience, and the bravery of those who risked their lives to save others.What I appreciated most about this graphic novel was its ability to educate and inform while entertaining. The historical accuracy was impressive, and the author didn't shy away from depicting the horrors of the time. However, it was done in a way that was appropriate for younger readers, ensuring they grasp the gravity of the events without being overwhelmed.The character development in this installment was exceptional. Mark's growth throughout the story was inspiring, as he faced danger, loss, and uncertainty. The supporting characters were equally well-developed, and their interactions added depth and emotion to the narrative.The pacing was spot-on, keeping me engaged from start to finish. The suspenseful moments were intense, and I found myself eagerly turning the pages to discover what would happen next. The graphic novel format allowed for a dynamic storytelling experience, immersing me in the action and emotions of the characters.As a teaching tool, this graphic novel is invaluable. It provides an engaging way for young readers to learn about the atrocities of the Nazi invasion while instilling empathy and understanding. It also encourages further exploration of this dark period in history.In summary, I Survived the Nazi Invasion, 1944: A Graphic Novel is a remarkable addition to the I Survived Graphic Novel series. With its stunning artwork, compelling storytelling, and educational value, it is a must-read for both young readers and history enthusiasts alike. I highly recommend this graphic novel for its ability to educate, entertain, and inspire.",

He likes reading but he usually reads books way below his reading level and this has just made him want to really read and sit down. I just catch him at random times reading instead of playing his video games which is great. And plus they get to learn history at the same time I can't wait for the new ones to come out next year.",
