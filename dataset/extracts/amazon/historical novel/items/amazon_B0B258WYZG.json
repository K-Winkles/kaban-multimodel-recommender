                "reviewText": "In May 1933, Nazis oversaw the burning of thousands of books, beginning their ban on any ideas that did not follow lockstep with their dictatorial world view.In 2022-23, the state of Florida removed over two thousand books from school libraries because someone\u2014often a single person\u2014objected to the book. One man alone, who has no children in the public school system, was able to demand removal of over 600 titles.Books ranged from classics like Tom Sawyer to Pulitzer Prize winners. As in Nazi Germany, many were written by people of color,or members of the LGBTQ+ community.In this novel, the characters Hannah says this:Few people have to watch their country die. I have had that dubious privilege and I can tell you that it comes not as a rebel shout but as a sly whisper. . .it can start with rumblings about an unreliable press. . that will threaten your family, your children.. . .it comes cloaked in patriotism.This book resonates with me, a lifelong reader and retired English teacher. The story is well written and the historical perspectives in both Germany of the 1930\u2019s and American politics in the 1940\u2019s are valuable",

Young American writer Althea James and Hannah Brecht meet in Berlin in 1933 and their story is told by Althea. Hannah Brecht is Jewish and a lesbian who has fled Germany and in 1936 is in Paris working at the German Library of Burned Books before the Germans invade. Vivian Childs is in New York in 1944 and working to fight an amendment to a bill that censors Armed Service Editions shipped to the millions of service men overseas. It is also a cautionary tale for our time. There may be a few instances of it being a bit heavy-handed, but it really doesn't distract much.",
