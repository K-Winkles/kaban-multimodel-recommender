Living in constant fear of the Russian soldiers, she works in a hospital to make ends meet, where she meets Werner, a cold-hearted career politician.Werner, a German \u00e9migr\u00e9 to Moscow, returns to his hometown with the highest hopes for a better future. Sent by the communist party to bring freedom, wealth and happiness to the people, he\u2019s soon caught in a moral conflict between loyalty to his party and his conscience.When Marlene criticizes the communist regime, she becomes the target of powerful men. Oblivious to the danger for her own life, she refused to back down, and there\u2019s only one thing Werner can do to save her life: defy the party line.But will he be able to shed decades of indoctrination for the woman he loves? And what will become of him if he does?

                "reviewText": "I have read several of Kummerow\u2019s novels. She never disappoints. It is hard for me to pick a favourite. I love them all. 'From the Ashes' is certainly no exception. But it does stand out as a highly emotive work that\u2019s reminiscent of Charles Dickens' 'Hard Times' and to a lesser extent, 'A Tale of Two Cities'. In this novel she explicitly addresses social and political injustices. Her thrust is not to entertain but to expose an oppressive yoke around the necks of the German citizens.It is important to me because it illuminates post WWII Germany. It shares insights into the mood of a people and the simmering rage against brutal treatment of dissenters who resisted the imposition of communism. The dissenting Germans had had enough of Hitler and his Nazis and no way would they yield to Stalin and his minions. They were both anti democratic repressive regimes.In 'From the Ashes', Kummerow established for me that the fall of the Berlin Wall was no overnight event. It certainly did not crumble from the breath of one man; nor did any underlying skilful diplomacy lead to its demise. The Berlin Wall was crumbling from day one. Its fall was inevitable and so too was the reunification of Germany. These two events resulted from the German peoples love for freedom and democracy.This really is an amazing novel. It is forceful and direct. Marion spares no bones. It\u2019s a pleasure to be informed through the literary imagination of a wonderful writer such as Marion Kummerow. I can truly say that she has \"open eyes and showed me what it means to defend what you believe in.\"",

I really enjoyed that it focused not on the usual aspects of the war (which are plentifully represented in literature) but on a subject that isn\u2019t much talked about and which should be - namely, how the Germans coped with losing the war and trying to rebuild their lives under a new administration. Through two main characters, Marlene and Werner (a regular citizen and a representative of the occupying force, respectively), the author shows with brutal honesty how difficult it was for someone to stand up for what is right. Werner was a particularly interesting character; both his inner conflicts and actual, physical conflicts he had to deal with daily while trying to do what\u2019s right for the people, are wonderfully presented. Historical research was meticulous and showed perfectly the hypocrisy of the new occupants of the city, who were just as autocratic and ruthless as the Nazis even though their ideology was called differently. A truly fascinating historical fiction offering an intimate glimpse into post-war Berlin and its inhabitants. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "Gripped my imagination on the first page and never let go.With her intensely researched, quickly paced, suspenseful, and engrossing narrative, the author puts us in the post-war Germany under the occupation by four victorious forces. Most of the events unfold in the Soviet sector, bringing to light the accurate account of how Germans reacted to the forced Sovietization, the subject rarely touched in the modern literature.Despite difficult life conditions, there is romance flourishing between two main characters, Marlene and Werner. Their feelings are perfectly interweaved with the then current situation in the country and will keep you turning pages to learn how one influenced each other under the dangerous and controversial circumstances. The twists and turns of the narrative will surprise you as will the ending, and you definitely would want to learn what is in store for them and other not less interesting characters who populate this absorbing story in the next book promised by the author.

                "reviewText": "This book was very well-written and makes the reader more aware that life was no better for some after the war was officially over. The sector of Berlin under brutal Russian occupation was very difficult for the German people. Food was rationed and there were no extras, while the French, British, American, & Russian military occupiers had plenty to eat and drink. The people in the Russian sector were bombarded with Communist propaganda. Anyone suspected of speaking out against this would \"disappear.\" Their treatment was just as brutal as the Nazi treatment was of their prisoners. A woman walking alone was at risk of being raped by Russian soldiers. I could really empathize with the developed characters in this story and was captivated to the last page. I will definitely read more books from this author!",

                "reviewText": "I have been meaning to read Marion Kummerow for a long time and finally she rose to the top of my Kindle TBR pile with this book. I knew very little about the chaotic times in Berlin immediately after the war, particularly the Soviets' power grab and vote-rigging. What an interesting story this made. I have visited Berlin twice, first in 1972 when I crossed the Wall at Checkpoint Charlie and then a dramatically different visit in 2006. Reading From the Ashes has made me want to visit again. Kummerow paints a vivid picture of the deprivation and destruction as well as the propaganda, persecution and Sovietisation that went on the Russian sector. I also found the power play between the various nations intriguing. So glad I finally got round to reading this. I'm sure it won't be the last of her books I will read.",
