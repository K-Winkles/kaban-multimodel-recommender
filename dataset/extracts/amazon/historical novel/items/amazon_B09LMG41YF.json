                "reviewText": "Another great WW2 story by the very talented Ellie Midwood. Much has already been written in lengthy reviews about this story so I ask myself what can I add? What comes to me is the authentic way the story flows like silk. Albeit set in a cruel historical time and tragedy is aplenty, it reads like the author is talking about people she knew and it is in this manner the story is most captivating because we care about the characters that propel the story along. Page after page, we want to know what will happen to them and hope for the best. My body is a good Geiger counter for the intensity of the authenticity of a read, so it is from the perspective of what I experienced reading Midwood\u2019s words that I say I felt her words! Deeply. Emotionally. Physiologically. A hearty kudos to Ellie Midwood for once again taking me on a most memorial journey. One that should never be forgot. One that I certainly won\u2019t forget.",

With that in mind I was going to down grade my rating, however upon learning that the story was written so closely to actual events, I upped my rating to 4 stars. The book was interesting throughout; having read so many of this author's books I have to rate in comparison with the many others. I would certainly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I read this because it was written from the German perspective rather than so many of the WW11 stories of Hollacost survivors. I found it heart-wrenching and tense. The characters were well-developed but this is not a book for those seeking escapism. These young people really wanted to save their homeland and were willing to give their lives so that the future generations would be able to live in a free and respected country.",
