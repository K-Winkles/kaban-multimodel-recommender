I loved the first book and couldn't read it fast enough to find out the mystery therein. It was a blast.

Add in engaging characters with flaws and internal struggles, side characters that become red herrings, and a solid mystery, and you have a perfect Patricia Haverton historical romance. Ms Haverton creates a compelling story filled with interesting characters, surprising drama and twist and turns. This story has Ms Haverton\u2019s customary dramatic flair by including a mystery when strange things happen in the home. Shadows lurking, footsteps in the night, death threats and secrets, all woven throughout until the evil ones reach their goal. Or do they? I truly enjoyed this story! I received a complimentary ARC, but I am voluntarily offering my personal opinion.",

Never asked him why he called the hero--Brother???The plot and the love story was beautiful but as to mystery--that needs work!I'm sorry to put anything negative and I'll continue to buy this author's books.",

He hated his father the, old DUKE he was violent and cold to both Aiden an his mother he swore never to feel love again (although kind to his brother he spends very little time with him he convinced himself that he has no love for him he blames him for the death of his very much loved mother).Aiden has no wish to marry but realised Marcus needs a mother - he decides to marry for that reason only it will be a contract for a mother figure for his brother he himself will have little contact or interaction with either of them and he would make that very clear to whoever he marries.LADY FELICITY - Had a younger sister who she loves very much her parents have fallen on hard times she is kind and loving yet receives very little from her parents, who have arranged a marriage for her to the Duke she has never met, she knows of him and his title people call him The Duke Of Ice.I LOVED THIS STORY ALSO THE CHARACTERS YOU GOT TO KNOW THEM EVEN MARCUS THE YOUNG BOY BRILLIANT CHARACTERS - SO MANY SECRETS IN THIS HOME NOT JUST THE SECRET PASSAGES. YOU COULD FEEL THE LONELINESS OF FELICITY AND MARCUS AND EVEN AIDENIf there was a negative in this book it would be why oh why every time they sat down for a meal you were gun a description of the table THE Beautiful moist joint of beef the succulent carrots with butter etc etc this was at every meal time.
