I can\u2019t wait to read the next book. My \u201ccriticism\u201d would be that I would have liked a little bit more interaction between the love interests when they were building their relationship, but also understand the constraints of the time period. I also feel like the male lead was a little forceful at some points. Even though we were getting the female POV, he was not and I felt he took liberties without explicit consent , personally preference though. I did like the twist and resolution at the end. Very interested to see how the next book goes. Hoping for a story with Anne! She ended up being one of my favorite characters!**I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.**",

                "reviewText": "This was my first historical romance, and I..I am at a loss for words. Finished this book in one day. The writing, the characters, everything was on a whole other level for me. I have a very, VERY short list of 5 star books, and I knew this book would be 5 stars 30% of the way through. If I finish a book, and can't stop thinking about it...it's five stars.Katherine's writing is incredible. I could not stop reading - her descriptions and her way with words are amazing. I have never swooned so hard for a character. Grahh!!! I mean, the book didn't have many spicy scenes, but, I couldn't catch my breath when they were getting steamy at the Duchess' house. Holy goodness.Viscount Hugh Rochford. Ahh, he has my affections, as well as Penelope's. My new book husband. It's difficult to NOT fall in love with this man. Who he was and how others perceived him - a true rake. But, he was but a man who had to grow up quickly to keep his life from falling apart. Rochford is a 5 star man for me.Penelope, though young, innocent and naive, captures you at the onset. She is smart and obviously has a good head on her shoulders. A bright and sunny girl who falls in love with a questionable, \"wondrously handsome\" Viscount.I am now a devoted Katherine Harlow fan. I cannot wait for the remaining books.Also, some say that this book isn't historically accurate, but I wouldn't know. I don't read books for time accuracy. If I wanted that, I'd read history books - and even those are questionable. I'm here for romance - even better if there's smut.",

Viscount Hugo Rochford and the Honorable Penelope Stratton do not seem like a wise match. He\u2019s got a terrible reputation as a womanizer and hasn\u2019t been interested in marriage and Penelope wants to marry for love and an educated sense of right and wrong. Hugo does Penelope a favor but introducing her cousin Anne to a former school friend and a terrific match is made for both. Now Hugo starts to think that Penelope is a terrific a match for him but her family hears a terrible story about him and his former fianc\u00e9. Her parents decidedly steer her in a different direction and Hugo is honor bound to correct the story. I enjoyed this book and will read the next installment once it\u2019s published.",

With a refreshing style and voice. The only thing wrong though\u2026\u2026.no back log to devour!I would not change one thing in the actual story it was down to Earth but had a dark, mysterious, fairytale quality to it. Misunderstood anti hero and plucky heroine. I read it in one sitting. The mark of an amazing book is the fact I\u2019m still mulling over it three days later. Actually thinking of rereading it again which I never do usually. Do yourself a favour and gorge on utter perfection\u2026..it\u2019s totally worth it.I\u2019m not surprised it\u2019s climbing Amazon Bestseller listing. Best book for me of 2023.Oh, whoever chose the front cover and second picture nailed it. Exactly as I imagined Hugo and Penelope would look. They are both perfectly written, well matched characters with depth to them. I was so engrossed with these two.Ms Harlow where have you been hiding your talents? I for one cannot wait for the next instalment of this series! I\u2019ll be waiting impatiently (sorry) for whatever morsel you choose to publish next.",
