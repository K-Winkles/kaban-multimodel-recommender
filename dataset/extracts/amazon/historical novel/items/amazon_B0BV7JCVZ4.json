                "reviewText": "Excellent book! I loved reading Lydia's story. The writing is fantastic, and the characters are very realistic. Lydia enjoys her animals and finds solace in talking to them about her day. When she is troubled, she often seeks their company for comfort rather than the company of people.Reading about Stephen's stoning was very heartbreaking but also beautiful. Jenifer took a difficult (sad) passage of Scripture and wove a very touching story. The entire book was great reading, but that particular passage really stayed with me.",

                "reviewText": "\"Lydia\" tells the story of one of Jesus' sisters in the post-Pentecost era. Lydia and the majority of her family are living in the home of Theophilus as the early church grows. While her brothers are involved in ministry, her life seems quite boring in comparison. She's stuck at home, making meals, while every other young woman she knows is either getting married or having babies. Then Stephen walks into her life, and nothing is the same. An engagement quickly follows, but a happily ever after is not what awaits Lydia. Will Lydia be able to forgive or will bitterness destroy her?For the first half of the book, Lydia is a pretty annoying and whining character. She is rather self-absorbed about her troubles and spends her time talking them out with her animals. The events that take place with Stephen's death force Lydia to grow as a person and in her faith.Overall, this is a lovely story.",

                "reviewText": "Once again we are immersed in the very beginnings of the early church after the death and resurrection of Jesus. This is book 5 in the Servant Siblings series.Lydia is the second oldest daughter, a hard worker who finds it easier to talk to the villa's animals than to other people. She has even given them Biblical names. Once again, we gain insight into the struggles of the disciples and their followers, the need to provide for so many, the need for the means to provide for them. We also are given a view into them as family men. We know from Scripture that Peter was married. His mother in law was healed by Jesus. So why would they not have families, loved ones, or future plans. We are given insight into just how much they left behind in order to follow Jesus and follow His command to spread His Good News. This really hits home as we read Lydia and Stephen's story. Yes, it is fiction, but Stephen was of an age to have been betrothed. We do know that he was one of the seven chosen to aid the disciples In caring for the needy and a godly man. Unfortunately, we know that there is no happily ever after for these two. I have to admit that I could not bring myself to read the chapter of Stephen's death right away. I knew how Lydia's heart would be broken along with all who knew Stephen. Did the disciplines realize that this was a harbinger of their own futures? How far is Lydia willing to go to seek revenge? Is forgiveness possible for her actions? This book gave me so much to think about beyond the basic story. As mentioned before, how much did the early followers give up to follow in the Way? Did they know how they would suffer for their faith? Just how much can be forgiven by Our Lord? Is everyone capable of being redeemed? I received this eBook from the author. These are my own opinions.",

Ms. Jennings\u2019 skill as an author was evident throughout, bringing the characters to life, and helping me better understand the many difficulties that the early Christians (or Followers of the Way) faced after Jesus\u2019 resurrection.I was totally immersed in the story from start to finish! Lydia was shown in all her humanity, bringing home the clear message that even Spirit-filled believers can be led astray, and desperately need to stay close to their Savior in order to stay pure in their daily walk. Knowing that we can have God\u2019s complete forgiveness when we fall prey to sin, and find hope for the future are gifts too wonderful for words!Many thanks to the author for providing me with a copy of this latest book in the Servant Siblings series. I had not read the previous books in the series when I started this one, but that didn\u2019t prevent me from enjoying and gaining tremendous inspiration from this book. I will most certainly go back and read the rest of the stories in this series.",

It is fiction but fleshes out the characters and enables the reader to get a clearer glimpse into Biblical times. A sibling of Messiah Jesus, Lydia has become betrothed to Stephen, a faithful follower of the Way. The Pharisees murder Stephen before he and Lydia complete their vows. When Lydia is forced to choose a path, she must select either the forgiveness her brother taught or seek revenge. I enjoy the Biblical fiction genre. It consistently sends me back to my Bible.I received a complimentary copy from the author. The opinions are my own.",
