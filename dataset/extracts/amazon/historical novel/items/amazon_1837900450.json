        "description": "France, 1942. \u201cWith tremendous effort, I forced myself to hold his gaze. My heart was thrashing inside my chest like a bird battering its wings. The room was suddenly devoid of air. Time itself stood still. They knew who I was. They knew what I\u2019d done.\u201d This heartbreaking World War Two page-turner tells the incredible true story of Dora Schaul, one of history\u2019s most courageous women.It was a misty Wednesday morning. Inside the Gestapo headquarters, you could cut the tension with a knife. There was a traitor in their midst: someone had leaked a list of the SS to the British press.The head of the Gestapo called me into his office. Panelled oak walls, a grand piano in the corner, rugs lining the floor\u2014the place where he ordered executions every day.I sat at the desk, reaching for the typewriter and adjusting the paper. On the wall, the clock ticked loudly.He stood over me; I could almost feel his breath on my neck. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the leak came from. Do you?\u201d he asked.I couldn\u2019t stop my hands from trembling. I was sure he could hear the thrashing of my heart.Because I wasn\u2019t just a secretary: I was an undercover Jewish girl. The person who fetched them tea, typed their letters, and made them laugh was their enemy. And my day of reckoning had arrived\u2026Fans of The Tattooist of Auschwitz, The Alice Network, and The Lilac Girls will be utterly swept away by this emotional page-turner about the brave woman who risked her life every day by coming face-to-face with enemy\u2014the monsters who killed her loved ones.Readers love Ellie Midwood:\u201cAMAZING read!

                "reviewText": "When I can't put a book down, it automatically earns five stars. THE UNDERCOVER SECRETARY by Ellie Midwood is one of those books. As historical fiction, it's based on a real woman, a Jewish woman of German birth who figured out what the Nazis were up to in time to leave Germany and then escape other countries before she was exterminated. Her friends didn't make it; her family didn't make it. But she did. How did she do it in plain sight of top Nazi officers? It's the \"how\" that makes the story intense because--told in first person--she has to have lived through the ordeal. The author has done a great job of making it all real and keeping us hooked. THE UNDERCOVER SECRETARY is exciting and relevant up to the last moment--as old conflicts and atrocities keep repeating themselves in history until we humans get the message.",

                "reviewText": "The Undercover Secretary details the experiences of a Jewish woman, Dora, during World War II in Germany and France. The story details her experiences in different occupations, and the treatment she received because she was Jewish. There are some graphic descriptions of the horrors inflicted on those who were Jewish and/or partisans, as well as the feelings of hopelessness and of fearlessness experienced by Dora. The story is difficult to read in different places due to the activities that are described - but the realities of war are brought home, and they aren't pretty. I think this is a book that more people should read so they can understand the brutalities of war and what it was like to be a non-Aryan and persecuted, having their rights taken away and faced with living with little food, no security, and a future of being sent to labor camps or death camps.The one thing I had a difficult time with as far as the book was concerned was wondering where the secretary part of the title came into play, as over halfway through the book the woman Dora was still not in a secretarial position. Eventually, she did become a secretary, as a spy in the Nazi offices.",

                "reviewTitle": "Based on a real life heroine",
                "reviewText": "Based on the real life of German Jew Dora Schaul (born Dora Davidsohn) born in Essen, Germany.By 1933 Nazism was on the rise and Dora immigrated to Amsterdam where she met Alfred Benjamin another Jewish exile and a member of the German Communist Party. When even Amsterdam was no longer safe she followed Alfred to Paris.By this time both have become members of Cominform.Dora and Alfred were in love but not yet married. Come 1939 war is declared and with no proper papers both are arrested and jailed in France. In 1942 both escaped captivity, but they got separated.From here on Dora is on her own.It took a long time for me to get into this book because I was put off by Dora\u2019s communist leanings and even as she is told what Stalin is doing to the people of Ukraine she is talked out of believing it possible.As history has recorded it was all quite true\u2026of course Dora would have had no way of knowing that at the time. But even that, as far as I\u2019m concerned, does not absolve her completely.That\u2019s one of the things this book showed me is how easily one can be blinded by propaganda. It\u2019s the thing that most disrupts the world we live in today but it was perfected many, many years ago.The Undercover Secretary part of the story comes nearly at the end of the book when Dora working for the French Resistance gets a job in Gestapo headquarters in Vichy France working for Klaus Barbie (Butcher of Lyon) and while it is an impressive story it is stuck at the end of the book making it feel like an afterthought.Because it is a story of great courage and it was entirely Dora\u2019s doing that the Lyon Gestapo were exposed I have rated the book 4-stars even though the first part of the book has nothing much to do with what the title suggests.",
