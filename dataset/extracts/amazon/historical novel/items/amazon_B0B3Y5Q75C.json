By the time she is just eight years old, the Duke has remarried and had a son, Eddie. While Sallie is her father\u2019s daughter, sharp-witted and resourceful, Eddie is his mother\u2019s son, timid and cerebral.

                "reviewText": "If Sallie Kincaid, the 19-year-old lead character in this roller coaster of a book by Jeannette Walls were real, we would be singing ballads written about her. What a character! What a book!Taking place primarily in the early 1920s in the poor, rural Virginia area of East Appalachia where the scars of World War I are still being felt by those who served, this is the story of Sallie Kincaid\u2014a Tomboy with a capital \"T\"\u2014and her outsized, powerful, and wealthy father Henry Edward Kincaid, who is known to everyone (even his daughter) as the Duke. (In Sallie's eyes, the Duke \"hung the moon and scattered the stars,\" hence the title of the book.) The Duke has led quite a checkered life with four wives\u2014the first of whom he divorced and second of whom he murdered (and got away with it)\u2014and three children.Sallie is the middle child, the daughter of the murdered wife, but she is so much like the Duke that he loves and adores her. Still, she has a rough life, being banished from the household at age eight only to return at age 17. Even though he holds no elected office, the Duke absolutely controls Claiborne County, Virginia with his numerous and often shady business dealings and political connections. When it's Sallie's turn at the helm, she is faced with a deadly family feud between the Kincaids and the Bonds, as well as the new laws of prohibition that turn the county's prolific whiskey business, dominated by the Black citizens, into a dangerous bootlegging operation with Sallie in charge.The magic of the novel is in Sallie's introspective thoughts and conflicts. As she expertly wields a Remington-22 rifle that she bought for $3 as a child and plots ways to strike the Bond family, she is also considering the moral and ethical implications of everything she and others do. All of this becomes quite complicated, considering the life she is leading.Just a note: I never saw it while I was reading the novel, but in the acknowledgements, author Jeannette Walls says the story was loosely inspired by England's King Henry VIII\u2014his life and his many wives. And yes! The connection is brilliant. The Duke's first name is even \"Henry.\" Clearly, Sallie Kincaid is the double of Queen Elizabeth I, the daughter of the beheaded Anne Boleyn.This book is a winner for two reasons: Sallie is one of the best book characters I have ever encountered, and the plot never lets up with surprise and tragic twists at every turn. Strap on your seat belt because this is a raucous literary ride!",

The topic, moonshining, is not often written about. It's very interesting. Family and relationship conflicts along with confusion and betrayal keep the story moving along in unforeseen twists and turns. The adoration and then disillusionment of a parent is an age-old conflict, but the eye-opening situation between Sallie and her father, The Duke is heartbreaking.I found myself reading just a little bit of the book each night. Why? Because I didn't want the story to end. The story was so encompassing that I just lingered within each scenario and didn't want to leave.I would love to see this novel turned into a movie!!!!READ THIS BOOK, PLEASE!",

Less characters, less revelations, and shorter in length would have made it much more enjoyable.",

I want more.",
