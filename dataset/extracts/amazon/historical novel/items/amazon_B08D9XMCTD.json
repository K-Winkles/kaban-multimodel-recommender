                "reviewText": "This is William Walker\u2019s third novel featuring Paul Muller his diplomat/spy protagonist. I reviewed his first novel \u201cDanzig\u201d a few years ago and have yet to read his second. Our characters come on the scene in late 1938 where neutral Switzerland is caught in a vice between England/France on one side and Nazi Germany on the other. England is threatening to engage in economic warfare against Germany, a war in which the Swiss economy would be collateral damage.The Brits seek out Muller to get information on the German economy. Muller is set up as a lure to find out what the Brits are up to. With the aid of Hilde Magendanz, an economist buried in the bowels of the Swiss National Bank he hits paydirt. Hilde initially comes off as a \u201cmousey woman\u201d in dingy office actually is not only brilliant but rather glamourous in high diplomatic settings. It is no brainer to figure out that there would soon be a romantic attachment between her and Muller.Hilde discovers that the German economy is teetering under the weight of armament expenditures that is rapidly draining Germany\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. Hjalmar Schact the Reichsbank president urges Hitler to cut back his armament buildup which Hitler accedes to in part, but in the end, Schacht is fired. Simply put Hitler had no choice but to go to war sooner rather than later.We find out that the Swiss are fearful that Germany was planning an end run around the Maginot Line through Switzerland. Though neutral Switzerland entered in a secret defense pact with France who would come to its aid should Germany invade, something I did not know.There is much more in the book and it makes for a good read. Walker makes at least one mistake when he attributes the phrase \u201carsenal of democracy\u201d in 1939, when in fact Roosevelt doesn\u2019t utter it until December 1940.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Unique approach to international intrigue",
                "reviewText": "The literature of international intrigue is simultaneously very broad and very shallow. Espionage abounds in all directions, of course. The characters may occupy lofty positions, or function as harassed and cynical grunts at the bottom. They may practise economic warfare, blowing up munitions trains or heavy water plants. But very seldom do they do the sums, the accounts, that ofrm a large part of the sinews of power. That perspective is what informs William N. Walker's (the N is important because there is at least one other William Walker in the international relations business) trilogy of novels on the adventures of a young Swiss on the fringes of Nazidom just before the Second World War. Paul Muller, the scion of a Swiss banking firm, applies his talents in Vienna in an attempt to save Austria's gold reserves from the Nazis, in Danzig (Gdansk today) to try to hold off the Nazis in the League of Nations free city of Danzing, the Hong Kong of that day. In this last book, Target Switzerland, Muller returns to his home turf and once again confronts the expansion of Nazi power. The reader will learn a lot about how Hitler managed the German economy -- and what that economy was. Walker has a lot of explaining to do, but the explanation is accurate, and it is not dull. Most i9mportantly, it does not interfere with the character of Muller, very Swiss, and the galaxy of character he meets. The Brits are full of mindless derring-do, the French are oblivious, the Germans and their Swiss dupes are sinister, and there is a love interest who turns out to be more interesting and to my mind more talented than her lover, Muller. This is an unusual book, or books, but it's one of those books that educates as well as entertains. Highly recommended.",

This true event plays in the background during the main events of the novel, which occur in 1939.The writing is good and well-paced, and I look forward to reading other books in the series.",

                "reviewTitle": "Pre-World War II Political/ Intelligence Novel",
                "reviewText": "This is the third novel in the Paul Muller series. All three novels are historical fiction written from the perspective of a Swiss national which, in itself, is unusual. The author has done a splendid job in marrying historical fact with political/intelligence fiction. His \"Author's Afterword\" on this latest occasion goes on a bit long, but that is a very minor criticism in relation to the overall strength of the story. I look forward to a continuation of Paul Muller's exploits in the next book \"If War Should Come\".",
