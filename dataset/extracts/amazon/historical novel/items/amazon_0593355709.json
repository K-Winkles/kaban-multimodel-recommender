All rights reserved. Chapter 1Battle Creek, MichiganWinter 1891 I was raised in religion, but it was not God who loomed largest over my girlhood and its earliest memories. That was Charles William Post, Charlie, or simply C.W. to those who knew him best. To me, he was only ever Papa.He cut no particularly imposing figure, what with his narrow frame, standing at just over six feet tall, and his fine, blue-\u00adeyed smile. But the man molded my world, and then he went on and changed everybody else\u2019s as well.You might say the same about my education, too, for although I went to school for all of my girlhood, it was on Papa\u2019s lap that I did the learning that would shape me. How Papa could spin a story, building worlds in my young mind until I came to believe that just about anything was possible. Because to Papa, anything was. There were the tales of the tall Springfield lawyer whom Papa admired, a family friend by the name of Mr. Abe Lincoln, who taught himself to read as a boy in a drafty log hut with nothing more than a tattered Bible and yet somehow found himself in charge of the White House. Of course Papa\u2014\u00adand then I\u2014\u00adknew all the presidents, but I loved the stories about Mr. Lincoln the best; Papa had made this singular man a friend while they lived in Springfield, after they\u2019d both sprung up from nothing but their own grit and the fertile frontier soil.Oh, but there were other good stories, too. Papa\u2019s words had me forging across the Great Divide on the back of a mule, just as he\u2019d done as a young man with his brother, my Uncle Cal, the pair of them sifting for gold amid the red mud and the pines. He had me battling Chicago\u2019s Great Fire or else waiting out a night of dust storms in Oklahoma, shivering beneath a heap of scratchy wagon canvas as the coyote yips mixed with the wind skittering against a flimsy tin roof. He talked of pianos that didn\u2019t need human fingers to play and buggies that didn\u2019t need horses to pull them.It always seemed to me that by the time I arrived in the world, Papa had tried his hand at pretty much everything: he\u2019d been an inventor in California, a salesman in Illinois, a farmer in Nebraska, a rancher in the wild Oklahoma Territory. Success had come in fickle fits and bursts, with plenty of failure mixed in, but he\u2019d managed to wed the sweetheart of his youth in the midst of it all. My mother, Ella Letitia Merriweather, a pale beauty with gray eyes and a reserved demeanor, came from a far more affluent family but the same Springfield roots.The borders of my young mind and memory can barely contain Papa: fine-\u00adfeatured, with an easy charm and smarts to best anyone else in the room, a sharp humor and a kind voice\u2014\u00adbut then sick. Suddenly and frightfully sick.It was this sickness that fueled our journey that winter, a journey that would end in a way that none of us, not even Papa, the incorrigible dreamer, could have possibly conceived.Battle Creek welcomed us with a wall of cold air, the sort of air that stuns, needling your cheeks and causing the breath to stick in your nostrils on the way in. Beside me, Papa leaned on Mother to limp off the Michigan Central line train car and onto the frigid platform. After weeks of travel, we had arrived, and for that I was grateful, but I feared that our stop might be Papa\u2019s final destination.\u201cYour father is near the end of mortals,\u201d Mother had whispered to me on our long journey up from Texas, both her words and the skin around her lips pulling tight with worry. Our train car had rocked back and forth in a doleful rhythm as swaths of ice-\u00adslicked farmland rolled past our frosted window. Papa groaned where he lay in the berth, the extra blankets doing little to warm his thin, trembling frame. I didn\u2019t know if perhaps he\u2019d heard Mother\u2019s words and was trying to respond or if he was simply giving voice to the pain that gripped his failing body. I also did not understand why Mother couldn\u2019t put a tender hand on him or lean close to offer some soothing words of comfort, anything to lend him just a tiny bit of warmth. But then I\u2019d rarely seen her do such a thing. And to be fair to Mother, it wasn\u2019t she to whom Papa called out when he had the strength for words. \u201cBudgie,\u201d he\u2019d whisper, his breath a sliver of pearly mist in the cold compartment, his voice so faint that I almost couldn\u2019t hear my nickname over the rolling thrum of the train\u2019s forward motion. \u201cYes, Papa, I\u2019m here,\u201d I\u2019d say, taking his wilted hands in mine and lowering myself down to pass the hours by his side. Singing the chaste Christian hymns he\u2019d sung over my bedside. Thinking with an ache, but knowing better than to say aloud: Papa, please don\u2019t leave me. What would I do without you?Papa\u2019s symptoms were a list of words that meant little to me at my young age. Migraines, melancholy, dyspepsia, insomnia, anxiety\u2014\u00adall in all, a nervous disturbance of both the body and the mind. Papa wasn\u2019t the only man to suffer such symptoms, but it seemed to me that nobody could have possibly had them worse.When at last the train lurched to its stop and we stepped out onto the platform, a weak winter sun was lowering itself over the bustling Battle Creek station. Grateful to be free of the train\u2019s close-packed air and the scent of the many bodies riding within, I gulped in several large, cold breaths and immediately detected the belches of train soot mixed with the aroma of the countless cows that filled the flat surrounding countryside. There was another tinny smell, one that I\u2019d soon come to know well enough: the promise of snow.Porters jostled around the crowded depot, seeing to trunks and boxes and weary travelers. Passengers shuffled about, looking for loved ones and luggage. I stood there shivering, glancing up at each parent in turn and wondering who was in charge: Mother? Or Papa, even though his body was so visibly useless? A porter in a smart cap and dark wool coat approached us, pushing a chair and looking to Papa with eyebrows raised. \u201cA wheelchair, sir?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d Papa, leaning on Mother\u2019s arm, nodded his feeble acceptance and collapsed into the chair\u2019s caned seat with a relieved sigh.\u201cTo the San?\u201d the porter asked, looking from Papa to Mother.We, like nearly everyone else on that darkening platform, had come for one reason: to seek the treatment of the famed Dr. John Kellogg. A physician by trade, the brilliant Battle Creek healer attracted the sick from the East Coast to the West\u2014\u00adold money and new\u2014\u00adand even from across the oceans. Slumped in his chair, Papa\u2019s let loose a low, faint groan.\u201cNo, to this address,\u201d Mother answered. Even though Dr. Kellogg and his wife had adopted dozens of children over the years, they did not look kindly on little ones roaming the campus, disrupting the hundreds of feeble patients and busy medical staffers, so Mother had arranged for us to take furnished lodgings in a house just several streets from the San campus.\u201cIt is the home of a widow, a Mrs. Elizabeth Gregory.\u201d Mother handed the porter a paper with our destination scrawled in her stiff cursive, and she watched, rigid as the frozen lampposts, as the young man oversaw the unloading of our few trunks and boxes. While Papa\u2019s body had gone slack with sickness, as though his bones could no longer hold him entirely together, Mother\u2019s figure seemed to coil ever tighter under the strain of our situation. I don\u2019t remember any hair color of hers other than white.\u201cI understand that the address is near the Sanitarium campus of Dr. Kellogg?\u201d Mother asked the porter, who nodded and assumed control of navigating Papa\u2019s wheelchair through the crowded depot. \u201cOh, yes, ma\u2019am. Everything in Battle Creek is near the San.\u201d Mother nodded her terse approval, taking my hand in her too-\u00adtight grip as we followed the young man and made our way down the platform toward the noisy street.Papa groaned as the porter did his best to gently lift him from the chair into a waiting wagon, where Mother and I also took seats. \u201cYou take care now, sir,\u201d said the kind young man. \u201cDr. Kellogg will have you fixed up in no time. We see miracles every day\u2014\u00adfolks limping off the train for treatment who end up skipping their way out of town.\u201d Papa did his best to answer the attendant with a dim smile and a nod. Mother simply folded her gloved hands in her lap, eyes fixed on some indeterminate point across the flat, frost-\u00adcovered farmland. I sat up a bit straighter as Papa turned his gaze toward me and offered me a wink. We\u2019d heard that Dr. Kellogg\u2019s ways were unorthodox and his treatments expensive, but all our hopes hinged on the man. Papa was near the end of mortals, to hear Mother tell it, and we had come here at the end of our hopes and our pennies; if anyone could heal Papa after years of these baffling ailments, we hoped it would be Dr. Kellogg.

I just had to be there with the Post cereal heiress through every twist and turn.\u201d\u2014Martha Hall Kelly, New York Times bestselling author of Lilac Girls\u201cNew-money heiress Marjorie Post isn\u2019t content to remain a society bride as she remakes herself into a savvy entrepreneur, a visionary philanthropist, a presidential hostess, and much more.\u201d\u2014Kate Quinn, New York Times bestselling author of The Rose CodeMrs. Post, the President and First Lady are here to see you. . . . So begins another average evening for Marjorie Merriweather Post. Presidents have come and gone, but she has hosted them all. Growing up in the modest farmlands of Battle Creek, Michigan, Marjorie was inspired by a few simple rules: always think for yourself, never take success for granted, and work hard\u2014even when deemed American royalty, even while covered in imperial diamonds. Marjorie had an insatiable drive to live and love and to give more than she got. From crawling through Moscow warehouses to rescue the Tsar\u2019s treasures to outrunning the Nazis in London, from serving the homeless of the Great Depression to entertaining Roosevelts, Kennedys, and Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars, Marjorie Merriweather Post lived an epic life few could imagine. Marjorie\u2019s journey began gluing cereal boxes in her father\u2019s barn as a young girl. No one could have predicted that C. W. Post\u2019s Cereal Company would grow into the General Foods empire and reshape the American way of life, with Marjorie as its heiress and leading lady. Not content to stay in her prescribed roles of high-society wife, mother, and hostess, Marjorie dared to demand more, making history in the process. Before turning thirty she amassed millions, becoming the wealthiest woman in the United States. But it was her life-force, advocacy, passion, and adventurous spirit that led to her stunning legacy. And yet Marjorie\u2019s story, though full of beauty and grandeur, set in the palatial homes she built such as Mar-a-Lago, was equally marked by challenge and tumult. A wife four times over, Marjorie sought her happily-ever-after with the blue-blooded party boy who could not outrun his demons, the charismatic financier whose charm turned to betrayal, the international diplomat with a dark side, and the bon vivant whose shocking secrets would shake Marjorie and all of society. Marjorie did everything on a grand scale, especially when it came to love.Bestselling and acclaimed author Allison Pataki has crafted an intimate portrait of a larger-than-life woman, a powerful story of one woman falling in love with her own voice and embracing her own power while shaping history in the process.

Brilliant business woman in a world of men. Great designer of homes and entertainer. Also, a beloved boss of her housekeeping staff. Her friends ranged from Alice Roosevelt to Lady Bird Johnson. One of her 4 husbands was EF Hutton. Another husband was the Ambassador to Russia after the Russian revolution. If you are ever in Washington DC, visit her home \"Hillwood\". Her collection of Russian treasures from the Czars and jewelry from Marie Antoinette are astounding. She also was a great philanthropist. At age 27 she became the wealthiest person in the world when she inherited the General Foods company . She expanded that wealth by introducing frozen foods into the marketplace with the Birdseye company. EH Hutton did not think that frozen foods would work- what did he know... I could go on and on- read the book.",

She really was strong-willed and intelligent. It was amazing how she decorated, threw parties, and hung out with all the rich people and politicians. I did get a little tired of hearing about it, though. I started skimming when there were long paragraphs of decorating descriptions and lists of people who were attending her events. I was happy to hear about her philanthropy and willingness to help during the wars, etc.",

As a non American, I had never heard of Marjorie Post, nor the Cereal company that generated her great fortune, but I was intrigued to read about her.However I found this book rather slow going and difficult to engage with, because Marjorie does not come across as a very nice woman. I thought she was spoilt and arrogant and was not surprised that she made a mess of 4 marriages. I suspect she was used to always getting her own way and consequently she would have been very hard to live with.This is an okay read, but not riveting.",
