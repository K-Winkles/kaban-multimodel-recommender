        "description": "One evening in 1951, an itinerant storyteller arrives unannounced at a house in the Irish countryside. In exchange for a bed and a warm meal, he invites his hosts and their neighbors to join him by the wintry fireside and begins to tell formative stories of Ireland's history. Ronan, a nine-year-old boy, grows so entranced by the storytelling that, when the old man leaves abruptly under mysterious circumstances, the boy devotes himself to finding him again. Ronan's search for the Storyteller becomes both a journey of self-discovery, long unspoken family secrets, and an immersion into the sometimes conflicting histories of his native land.A sweeping novel of huge ambition, Ireland is the beautifully told story of a remarkable nation. It rings with the truth of a writer passionate about his country and in full command of his craft. Read more",

                "reviewText": "Ronan O\u2019Mara is a nine-year old boy who lives in rural Ireland with his mother, father, and aunt. The year is 1951. One day, a mysterious stranger \u2013 an older man \u2013 appears at the doorstep. Who is he? We don\u2019t know. We know his visit is expected. Neighbors come over, and the stranger tells the family and their neighbors a story. Several stories actually. It seems this is the gift of the stranger. A storyteller. Ronan wishes the man could stay forever, but his impatient mother feels he\u2019s outstayed his welcome after a few days, and the stranger leaves. There\u2019s something about this man that has touched Ronan\u2019s soul though, and Ronan can\u2019t rest easy with the stranger no longer in his life. So Ronan begins a twelve year quest to find the stranger.Now, before I go further, let\u2019s go back to the stories that the old man told Ronan and company. These stories are quite a pleasant diversion from our \u201cmain\u201d story. The stories that the stranger tells are about the people\u2019s homeland and history -the history of Ireland. True, there\u2019s a lot of myth, fable, and tradition within these yarns, but the storyteller knows how to enrapture an audience. It doesn\u2019t surprise us in the least that Ronan can\u2019t rest until he finds out where the man is after he leaves. At the very least, it would be nice to find out who he is.Reading this wonderful novel allows you to suspend any sort of disbelief you may have. Is it really common to invite a complete stranger into your house for a week simply because he can tell stories? Is this man even real? Or is he a figment of young Ronan\u2019s imagination? Does the existence of this character serve only to aid Ronan discover his destiny? Good stories really are rare, and Frank Delaney simply entertains us to the point that we simply don\u2019t want to add too much logic within the pages we\u2019re reading. These stories of Ireland that are juxtaposed through the pages are simply wonderful tales, and many times altogether too brief.As Ronan embarks on his journey, he seems to be forever one or two steps behind the storyteller. But this doesn\u2019t stop Ronan from hearing more of the stranger\u2019s stories. Wherever Ronan goes, it seems he\u2019s allowed to hear more stories from the stranger in many different forms. Sometimes, he hears the stories secondhand. Other times, the story teller leaves Ronan written tales that the storyteller composed for him to enjoy. It seems the stranger knows Ronan might be searching for him.What makes this novel more pleasurable as that we also get to know Ronan and his family quite well. Had these extra tales not been thrown into the main storyline, this still would have been a terrific book. Ronan, like all of us, has his own life to live, and as the story progresses, we learn more about his own personal history and the events that shape his character. So maybe a great way to describe this book is \u201cseveral wonderful stories told within a story\u201d.Although this book takes place in Ireland and all of the stories are about Ireland\u2019s history, the overall feel is quite light. This isn\u2019t a densely packed James Michener type of book. I feel that had author Frank Delaney wanted to write such a book, he could have easily done so, however. But overall, this book is rather light on the historical narratives of the country. The main objective here is Ronan, and his quest to find his calling.I loved this book. As someone who reads quite a bit of fiction, I never take great writing for granted. The story is the point of a good book, but more important is how the author tells the story. How else could John Grisham become so popular? On the surface, dozens of books about the law profession don\u2019t sound very exciting, but Grisham is a great storyteller.And so is Frank Delaney. After reading this book (Summer 2018) I was sad to discover that Mr. Delaney passed away about a year ago. Fortunately, he has several other books that he penned (all seem to be somewhat related to Ireland), and I\u2019m eagerly looking forward to reading more by this author.",

                "reviewText": "\"Ireland\u201d is Frank Delaney\u2019s first book to be published in the United States. He hails from County Tipperary and writes about the country he loves.Delaney\u2019s book is full of historical information, as well as Irish legends and lore. It delves into the remote past and even begins the story with the last Ice Age when glaciers carved out the hills and valleys of Ireland. This extensive historical novel covers a wide variety of material in Irish history. Delaney writes of the English oppression, the Irish resistance, heroes and myths, and the skill of storytellers. Even the different counties in Ireland are addressed with their distinctive cultural flavors.Itinerant storytellers frequented the area in Tipperary where the author grew up. The oral tradition was very strong. Stories, often with some elaboration, were handed down through the generations.Frank Delaney\u2019s book centers on an itinerant storyteller and Rolan, a boy who had heard this amazing storyteller when his father invited him to his parent\u2019s home. After a couple of days, his mother had made the storyteller leave, but Rolan, who was only a young boy at the time, had desperately wanted him to stay and never forgot him. Rolan\u2019s mother was remote and cold. His father was also somewhat distant. Rolan was lonely and yearned for a feeling of belonging. He became consumed with this storyteller. \u201cLike a plowman opening a field, he had carved out the beginnings of my imagination; he and helped me recognize instinctively the country and the people of whom I belonged\u201d.Rolan followed this mysterious storyteller over the countryside but always missed seeing him. At times, Rolan received notes from the storyteller. The storyteller had promised to teach him, and, yes, certain notes gave Rolan information about the techniques of good storytelling.The storyteller\u2019s disappearance was puzzling. At the end of the book, Rolan finds out some secrets that shed light on the storyteller\u2019s behavior and his own relationship to the storyteller.The book is really an epic story. It was much longer than I expected. Unfortunately, sometimes it just dragged on and on, and I wanted it to be over. I had to read other books to get a break from it at times. Often I felt like I was reading a history book and had to really concentrate to take it all in. However, fact and fiction was so intertwined in sections that sometimes I was confused as to the historical facts. Sometimes more caffeine was needed to get me through some sections. However, the author\u2019s research was excellent, and I really did learn a great deal about Ireland from reading this book.",
