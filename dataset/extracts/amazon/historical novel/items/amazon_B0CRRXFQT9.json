                "reviewText": "I found the character of Annette to be very inconsistent, which was a real disappointment. She starts out strong and fierce in her emotions and actions, even if they are irrational and prejudiced. However, later in the story when she has firsthand knowledge, she not only does not act on it, she becomes weak and impotent. Annette believed and acted on gossip more forcefully than she believed and acted on things she experienced personally.There was also what I consider to be too much internal thinking by Annette which is actually not only repetitive, but also slows down the story. Even worse, she never actually follows through on any of her thoughts, but just keeps debating them over and over again. The only reason I gave the book this many stars is because of the dramatic scene near the end of the book that was not only very compelling, but also very satisfying.The large number of typos were distracting and are part of the reason for my rating. But they are overshadowed by my distaste for the manipulative way that readers are forced to give their email information. It used to be that to read the extended epilogues you had to click and give your contact information (also requiring internet access), but now authors are also adding introductory chapters that also require the same thing. It makes me angry that they manipulate readers like that, rather than just including the prequel chapters and extended epilogues as part of the book.",

                "reviewText": "Magnus held his best friend in his arms on the battlefield and promised him that he would follow his dying words to take care of and marry his sister when he returned from the war. Annette was shocked when her Uncle informed her that she would be marrying Magnus. Now if Magnus was not labeled as the Mad Duke maybe she would have not been concerned but rumors had it that he had beaten his fianc\u00e9 and was not to be trusted to be a loving, caring person. This sets the backdrop for how they would interact with each other and how Magnus would have to show Annette who he really was as a person and not the individual that the gossip had labeled him. We have a number of shocking events, both in what actually forces them to marry and later on when Annette has finally come to terms of who Magnus really is as a person.",

Her uncle informs her that he has arranged her marriage to the duke and she is to meet him for the first time at the house party.They meet and then the action begins.

                "reviewText": "Marcus and Annette's story would be awful if it weren't for the wonderful protagonists and the messages it contains: nobody can relate to what fighting in a war and watching a friend die does to your mind and soul, but society is fast condemning people who do not fit into their patterns, unfortunately not much has changed about that until today. Being forced into a marriage of convenience also doesn't guarantee for a happy life, so I was very satiesfied when schemers trying to add to the couple's strains didn't succeed.",
