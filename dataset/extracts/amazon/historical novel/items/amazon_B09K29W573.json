Hubert Wiggins is still living a double life and willing to go through great lengths to keep it hidden. Being the most wanted man in his community due to his success, good looks and status in the church, he has lots of women competing for him. Meanwhile black women are being murdered in this small tight knit community by a serial killer and the police force refuse to investigate because \u2026 racism. As the story progresses some secrets stay secrets and new secrets are created. It\u2019s a fast and exciting read that took me on an emotional ride. Picked up and started book 3 on the same day that I finished book 2.",
