I have never read such an honest account of the Holocaust and its aftermath. This novel raised many questions for me to ponder. Questions I never thought of before. The author also introduced me to ideas I had not thought of. Some I understood some I didn\u2019t. As a lover and student of History, WW11 and the Holocaust are topics I am deeply interested in. After all I have read, I still don\u2019t understand how the German army could conceive and carry out the \u2018the final solution\u2019. How could the German people stand by and let it happen? Reading some of the terrible things ordinary soldiers did to Jewish people filled me with horror. How could one person do that to another? This is an excellent book to read! Very interesting and thought provoking. I only wish Kaddish could have lived long enough to meet his cousin again.",
