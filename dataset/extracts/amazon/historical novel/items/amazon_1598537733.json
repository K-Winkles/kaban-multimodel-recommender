        "description": "Together for the first time, all 5 standalone novels from the Hugo and Nebula award\u2013winning writer who reinvented science fiction, including one restored to printSpans from the 1971 classic The Lathe of Heaven to her career-crowning 2008 masterpiece LaviniaThis 7th volume in the definitive Library of America edition of Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s works presents 5 remarkable standalone novels that showcase her boundless creativity and literary range.In the Locus Award\u2013winning The Lathe of Heaven (1971), one of Le Guin\u2019s most admired works of science fiction, George Orr begins have effective dreams: dreams that change reality itself. But when he turns to the sleep researcher William Haber for help, the doctor sees an opportunity to use Orr\u2019s strange gift for his own ends.A former Terran prison colony on the planet Victoria seems destined for revolution in The Eye of the Heron (1978), when the authoritarian leaders in the City try to assert control over the peaceful farmers who have been sent to live around them.The Beginning Place (1980) is a parable-like story in which Hugh and Irena have both found their way to the Beginning Place, a gateway to another world. The two initially become enemies, but must learn to work together when the utopia they\u2019ve found turns out to have a shadow.The long out-of-print Searoad: Chronicles of Klatsand (1991) is a Winesburg, Ohio-like series of linked stories set in a small vacation town on the Oregon coast, where some of the characters have come for a weekend and some for longer, but all are pilgrims in the grip of inexpressible longings.And Le Guin\u2019s final, powerfully feminist novel, Lavinia (2008), reimagines Virgil's Aeneid from the perspective of a woman who, in poet's telling, never speaks a word. Special features include an appendix presenting three essays by Le Guin related to the novels, previously unseen hand-drawn maps by author herself, helpful annotation, and a chronology of Le Guin's life and career.Brought together here for the first time, these 5 remarkable standalone novels showcase a Hugo and Nebula Award\u2013winning master at her very best.
