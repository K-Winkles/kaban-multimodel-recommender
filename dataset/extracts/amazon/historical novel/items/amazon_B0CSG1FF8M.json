She is resisting, but cannot stop his plan to have a competition to have other clans vie for her hand.Laird Arran MacGregor is a close friend of Duncans, and likes Yvaine, but does not want to marry, due to fears he will become like his father who was not a good leader and a vile man. Arran is the technically the Laird of his clan since his father was killed, but avoids his clan, as he does not want to be the Laird. He has a man he trusts as his second, but his clan is plagued with attacks from Laochra bandits who attack his villages and his people are in despair.Yvaine is kidnapped by the Laochra bandits more than once, but escapes. Her life is in danger, although the bandits are told to kill anyone who tries to protect her, but keep her alive. It seems like a clan leader is behind the bandits, but it is hard to tell who it is and why she is targeted. Suspicion is everywhere as to who it is.The competition starts, and Arran does not like to see Yvaine talking to other clan leaders and does not like to see them pursue her. He does not feel worthy to be her husband, but cannot stand to see the other leaders giving her their attention.Laird Duncan started this competition hoping to push Yvaine and Arran together because everyone close to them and their interactions knows they will be a good match. Both are resisting.It was hard to discern who is trying to cause all the trouble for Arran's clan and for Yvaine. The book held my attention and had a good plot. I gave it 5 stars!",

                "reviewText": "Another amazing tale from this talented and crafty storyteller! Duncan, Yvaine\u2019s older brother and Arran\u2019s best friend, decided that it was time for Yvaine to marry, something to which she was adamantly opposed. A competition was announced and the invitations went out to all of the elgible lairds, stating that the winner would gain Yvaine\u2019s hand in marriage. It drove Arran crazy to see Yvaine spending time with the other men, and since he had vowed never to marry in order to make sure that his father\u2019s line ended with him, he knew that he would just have to live with his jealousy. Arran\u2019s mixed messages were frustrating Yvaine, who was sure he cared for her if he would only admit it. Fast forward and they are married and living in his castle. Now he has to come to terms with being an active laird, while keeping Yvaine at arm\u2019s length. This story is nonstop action. There are kidnappings, bandits, betrayals, battles, immobilizing potions, celebrations, bedsport and so much move. Arran strives to be a better man than his evil father, and vascillates between anger and fear as he tries to get his emotions under control. This story will spike your blood pressure, tie your stomach in knots and have you smiling from ear to ear. It is exciting, dramatic and oh so steamy! Loved it!",
