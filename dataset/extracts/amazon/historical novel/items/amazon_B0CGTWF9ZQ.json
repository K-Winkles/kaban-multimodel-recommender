                "reviewText": "The Filigree Master\u2019s Apprentice, set in late nineteenth-century Porto, Portugal, is a treasure. English-language readers are inundated with books set in England and the United States. How special to be able to read about an unfamiliar time and place. The author has thoroughly researched the book, and we learn splendid, fascinating, and sordid details about life in Porto. Henrique, a 17 year old from the Douro wine region, seeks a better life as an apprentice to a filigree maker in Porto. He must skillfully navigate not only the Douro River to get to Porto, but also on his arrival the jealousy and machinations of a would-be apprentice, Hugo. The completion and inauguration of the Eiffel bridge, a symbol of the city\u2019s industrial and cultural progress, fills the city with excitement. Henrique associates the new bridge with his new life. When he learns of a possible plot to destroy the bridge and the royal family who will be attending the inauguration ceremony, he must act. I thoroughly enjoyed Rossio Square N.\u00b059, Jeannine Johnson\u2019s first historical novel set in Lisbon during World War Two. She is a skillful, thoughtful writer and her new novel will not disappoint.",
