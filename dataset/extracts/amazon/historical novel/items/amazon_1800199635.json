We never really know the story of another until we take the time to ask and listen.I really love the development of these characters. It made getting to know them real and personal for me. I related with a few of the characters and I really liked a few of them. It is love that draws me to the ones I really like.It was easy to get lost in the emotions and forget the deep terror of war happening as the normal for these people's lives. I love the strength of them. I love the honor in them. I also love the hesitancy of following your heart after being burned by making that same choice earlier.Life is messy.War is messy.Love is messy but the rewards are better than one could ever hope to imagine.Take a leap into the leaps taken by these very ordinary people.",
