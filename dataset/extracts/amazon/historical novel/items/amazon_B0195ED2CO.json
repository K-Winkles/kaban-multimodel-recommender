        "description": "In a compelling, richly researched novel that draws from thousands of letters and original sources, best-selling authors Stephanie Dray and Laura Kamoie tell the fascinating, untold story of Thomas Jefferson's eldest daughter, Martha \"Patsy\" Jefferson Randolph - a woman who kept the secrets of our most enigmatic founding father and shaped an American legacy. From her earliest days, Patsy Jefferson knows that though her father loves his family dearly, his devotion to his country runs deeper still. As Thomas Jefferson's oldest daughter, she becomes his helpmate, protector, and constant companion in the wake of her mother's death, traveling with him when he becomes American minister to France. It is in Paris, at the glittering court and among the first tumultuous days of revolution, that 15-year-old Patsy learns about her father's troubling liaison with Sally Hemings, a slave girl her own age. Meanwhile Patsy has fallen in love - with her father's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, William Short, a staunch abolitionist and ambitious diplomat. Torn between love, principles, and the bonds of family, Patsy questions whether she can choose a life as William's wife and still be a devoted daughter. Her choice will follow her in the years to come to Virginia farmland, Monticello, and even the White House. And as scandal, tragedy, and poverty threaten her family, Patsy must decide how much she will sacrifice to protect her father's reputation, in the process defining not just his political legacy but that of the nation he founded.

                "reviewText": "My book club reads a lot of biographical fiction. It\u2019s an interesting and entertaining way to learn more about a specific time, place, and person in history. This month we chose America\u2019s First Daughter by Stephanie Dray and Laura Kamoie. With the first person POV of the main character, Martha \u201cPatsy\u201d Jefferson Randolph, it explores the life of not only Thomas Jefferson\u2019s daughter, but of his contemporaries and family members. The book begins when Patsy is a young girl and finishes with her later years. It is filled with historical detail that a history-nerd will love. The Revolutionary War and the early years of the nation are not time periods I generally read, but this book was fascinating in its portrayal of a young nation founded on high moral principles, yet in reality a democracy riddled with injustices. Slavery, the huge elephant in the room given Jefferson\u2019s own ownership of slaves and his relationship with Sally Hemings, is a big part of the story. Patsy is definitely a woman of her time, and though she abhors slavery (as do many of her acquaintance) she is unable to affect any kind of meaningful change. In fact, those with the power to do so either were unsuccessful or left it to later generations. The authors do a good job of balancing the context of the time (slavery, limited rights of women and children) with an honest portrayal of the subject matter. This is Patsy\u2019s story to tell, and I feel the authors allowed this incredible woman to tell it. Patsy was witness to so much \u2014 the American Revolution, formation of a new nation, the unfolding of the French revolution, the rise and fall of political factions \u2014 yet she was first and foremost a dutiful daughter, a committed wife, and a nurturing mother of many children. Her life was both extraordinary and ordinary, and the novel expresses that so well.If you are a fan of early American history, then this book is definitely for you. My book club googled a lot during the reading of the book! We also had an outstanding discussion.Recommended.Audience: adults.(I purchased Kindle ebook from Amazon. All opinions expressed are mine alone.)",

                "reviewText": "A little disclaimer before we begin. I\u2019m a MASSIVE history nerd, and even more so, American History (mostly Revolution and Civil War). Between having the Hamilton soundtrack on repeat most days, our recent Independence Day in America, a few historical road trips over the past couple of months, and the current state of affairs in our nation, I couldn\u2019t help but pick up this book. I actually purchased it months ago, but when I was going through my personal shelves looking for something that just \u201cspoke\u201d to me in the moment, this was the one that won out instantly. After spending almost a full month savoring every page, I can finally say it was well worth the journey.I always knew the Founding Fathers were superheroes of sorts. As Thomas Jefferson told me when I was in Williamsburg not too long ago, \u201cwe stand on the shoulders of giants\u201d, and while he was referring to those who came even before him, I know I can say this about these men as well. Speaking of Jefferson\u2026While First Daughter is a work of historical fiction, the authors clearly did their research and brought in material from thousands of letters and documents to tell the story through the eyes of Martha \u201cPatsy\u201d Jefferson Randolph. We meet her as she travels with her father and family to escape the British during The Revolution and follow every monumental moment of her life to an Andrew Jackson presidency.Throughout most of the book, she speaks of her father doing his duty to the American nation, but what she doesn\u2019t tell us directly is the part she played helping to shape the country. The Jefferson family suffered quite a bit, and thanks to Patsy, I was able to go behind closed doors and really understand and sympathize with not only their family, but the author of The Declaration of Independence and our third president.My heart ached for Mr. Jefferson, yet I learned so much more about him and his brilliant but tortured soul. His losses are tremendous, whether it\u2019s of a child or his beloved wife, but his duty to family and country are to be admired greatly. He promises his dying partner he\u2019ll never marry again, so Patsy becomes his companion of sorts and helps him on days when he can\u2019t even seem to get out of bed. Of crows, he has Sally too, but his relationship with her causes his soul to tear in two as he tries to make the right decisions, while also keeping her safe from public ridicule.Patsy deserves all the credit in the world. She cares for her father whether they\u2019re under the same roof, or far apart. She advises him on matters of family and state, while also keeping their home at Monticello afloat as best she can. With an abusive husband and eleven children of her own, she never loses heart, and does what she can to make sure everyone is seen to and cared for properly.This story is so rich in history, drama, romance, and politics, that it can draw in numerous audiences. There is something for everyone, I assure you. I walked away from these pages having learned infinitely more about my country\u2019s founding, the genius who helped to establish our roots, and the daughter who went above and beyond her patriotic duty and shared the gift of her father with us all. I didn\u2019t want it to end, and now all I want to do is gobble up more novels just like this one!",
