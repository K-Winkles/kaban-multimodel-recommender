        "description": "Lizzie and Karl's mother is a zoo keeper; the family has become attached to an orphaned elephant named Marlene, who will be destroyed as a precautionary measure so she and the other animals don't run wild should the zoo be hit by bombs. The family persuades the zoo director to let Marlene stay in their garden instead. When the city is bombed, the family flees with thousands of others, but how can they walk the same route when they have an elephant in tow, and keep themselves safe? Along the way, they meet Peter, a Canadian navigator who risks his own capture to save the family. As Michael Morpurgo writes in an author's note, An Elephant in the Garden is inspired by historical truths, and by his admiration for elephants, \"the noblest and wisest and most sensitive of all creatures.\" Here is a story that brings together an unlikely group of survivors whose faith in kindness and love proves the best weapon of all.",

                "reviewText": "Amazing to think this is based on a true story. The story begins with a nurse who is working in an \"old-person's nursing home,\" and since she's raising her boy alone, he frequently comes with her to work. He and other children are very much appreciated as they provide entertainment for the elders who watch them play outside, or in bad weather, interact more together. One of the residents is Lizzie. One day she begins a story, telling the nurse's son about life in Dresden in WWII, about how her mother brought home an elephant from the zoo to care for her in the event the city was bombed. We go back in time to when Lizzie was sixteen, her little brother was around eight, and their father had to go off to fight in the war. When the city is bombed, Mother, Lizzie, and Karli set off for the countryside on foot, with Marlene the elephant alongside. The saga is quite rough, but sanitized a bit for younger readers. Although the aspect of the elephant is unusual, it's a glimpse into how the refugees fleeing conflict had to copy. An easy read with an uplifting ending.",

                "reviewText": "An Elephant In The Garden by Michael Morpurgo is a powerful dual timeline novel that I just could not put down. It is perfect for ages ten years and over. Whatever your age, this is a beautiful novel that will educate and entertain.The story is set in present day in a nursing home and also looking backwards to Dresden in 1945.An old lady is dismissed as having dementia when she talks about the elephant in her garden. Only a young boy recognizes it as true and longs to hear her tale.We witness the dreadful destruction of Dresden by the Allies. Michael Morpurgo writes powerfully about the fires of hell that engulf the town. Like the story of Lot in the Bible, the family must move forwards and not look back.Families come in different shapes and sizes. This family is a mother, two children and a baby elephant. The elephant is an orphan and views the human mother as her mother. The baby elephant brings out the mothering instincts in the human mother.Along the way there are dangers in the form of the landscape of winter, the Russians, the Nazis, soldiers and civilians. The band of four must work together in order to survive.We see that not all Germans are Nazis. Young men fighting on both sides are battle weary and just want to go home.A mother\u2019s love is all encompassing. I found this quote very powerful. \u201cShe [mother] took me into her arms then, and hugged the anger out of me.\u201dI always enjoy Michael Morpurgo\u2019s novels. An Elephant In The Garden is a very powerful and entertaining read.",

                "reviewText": "An unusual setting, the story features a German family during World War II. We don't often read things from that perspective but you will instantly like these characters and be drawn in to their hardships, family relationships and unique war experiences (which include an elephant!). It is historical and educational but not dry with moments of sadness, humour, danger and love. I highly recommend it for tweens and adults alike.",
