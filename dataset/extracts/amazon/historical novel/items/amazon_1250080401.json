                "reviewText": "This should be required reading for everyone who is 14 or older. It's a story of two sisters who discover too late that they are more alike than different. A dysfunctional family that manages to function. Blended families who learn the greatest lessons of all. It's a story of the worst evil that can be done, which is perhaps not the true facts of the greatest mass extinction in our recent history, but the destruction of a human soul. It's the story of the high cost of victory over evil, the sacrifices for survival of life, the glory of two sisters who one day discover that they see themselves in the other's eyes. I may shed a tear or two watching a heart-rending movie scene once or twice in a year, but I have only shed tears from reading a book twice in my long life, (and a conservative estimate of how many books that I have read in my life is in the neighborhood of 1,200+), and this book is one of those two. It's not a \"true\" story, but is based many true facts & historic figures. It carries within it THE truth that some evil just cannot be allowed to begin or the entire world will suffer. THE truth that only the eternal vigilance of love can prevent it.If someone doesn't make a movie from this book, they are losing a fortune & robbing the world of a valuable resource for good!",

                "reviewText": "I chose this book mostly because it was on sale for $1.99 and, for a Kindle challenge, I had to read a book from a list provides. Since I'd recently--a few weeks ago, to be precise-- watched a movie about the young woman who agreed to hide Anne Frank, her family, and others, I though this would be an interesting book to read.Am I refer glad that I did! As my title states, I had to constantly remind myself that it was historical fiction, as the stories of the various characters are so believable. In the end, the main character was brought into existence by a real person who dad what she, Isabelle, did in the book.In my opinion, the author succeeds in opening a door and revealing one of WWII's well kept secrets: the women who showed am amazing courage, breaking free of the stereotypes of the time, however unintended, or unwilling! Too often we forget about the women in war. The men who fight are heroes, but without taking away from their heroism, we should also think and learn about the women who fought back from the shadows.The author's questions at the end of the book made me pause and think.Yes, the book affected me. A few grammatical errors aside, it was exceptionally well written. It is most definitely worth the read.Funny sidenote, I read this book over 3 or 4 days while simultaneously reading a totally different type of fiction: Fourth Wing! This morning, I had the same number of pages left in both books: 279. \ud83d\ude04.So, this is all as I have 279 page waiting for me in Fourth Wing.Read The Nightingale: A Novel. You won't regret it!",

                "reviewText": "This book will stick with me for a long time and instantly become a classic. The heroism of these amazing women is one to reflect deeply on. Kristin capture the internal struggle of knowing what is right vs doing what is right so beautifully. Human compassion is one that is rare today but it reveals itself when times are severe. It makes you question whether or not you will be brave enough to protect or surrender your life for strangers. It also is a good reminder that friends and family are so important to keep close to you now so when times are crucial you have emotional, physical, and spiritual support and you can support them as well. Sadly I also learn what some neighbors and so-called friends would be willing to do to save themselves or get in good with the real enemy in order to prosper during hard times. This book had it all. Love, family, friends, secrets, twist, courage, endurance, and what it is to be a true hero for your fellow human beings. IT made me feel so many emotions like happy, angry, sad, and hopeful. I will recommend this book to everyone and I recommend you have your box of tissues.",
