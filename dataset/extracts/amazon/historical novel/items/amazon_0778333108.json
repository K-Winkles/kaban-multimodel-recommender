                "reviewText": "Deep,thought provoking historical mystery book on what one will do when pushed to their limit, when choices have been taken from them and desperation is all you have. Sometimes in youth one may choose the wild, unpredictable partner, only to later regret those choices, even leading to death. The book follows the lives of two women centuries apart on a journey of discovery, trying to be their authentic selves, but coming upon roadblocks around each bend. Evelyn and Abby each seek acceptance, answers, and new beginnings. Each venturing away from those who are familiar to uncover who they may become. One journeys to America in the late 1800\u2019s to finally have a voice, the other to England in present day, for answers and resolutions. Evelyn\u2019s marries the wrong man. Her gift of prose is stolen by her abusive and vile husband and claimed as his own in a time where wives were little more than property. Abby, in current times, seeks to find the father she has never known, and discovers a gift that will heal the holes left in her. This book will find you full of emotions ranging from disgust and unbelief to cheering for pure cleverness , and intrigue to finally frustration of timing throughout the histories of both women. The one thing it won\u2019t find, is you putting it down until the last page.",

Seriously\u2026 don\u2019t you think the conversation where William threatens the heroine\u2019s financial security and the rights to see her son should have been spelled out for the reader instead of a sentence of after thought?Other than a few inconsistencies and way too many \u201ccoincidences\u201d, the author can spin a plot, but be prepared for a miserable, shallow \u201cheroine\u201d who needs drugs to function, is too weak to stand up for herself in front of anybody, takes advantage of a gentle former fianc\u00e9 to meet her own selfish needs, can\u2019t stand her own baby but has a relationship with a five to ten year old neighbor kid with whom she discusses modern literature\u2026.Yeah\u2026 it didn\u2019t work for me either. I found no redeeming qualities in her and could have cared less if she was successful. In the face of such a miserable, whiny character, the weak appeal to feminism flops miserably.The modern day heroine was a little more like able and at least gave us a happily ever after.",
