                "reviewText": "I adore the characters that Ms Quinn creates and the stories she weaves with details of the period clothing, mores and the day to day life of the upper class and the lower ones. My one complaint is there are so many characters, many whom have several names and titles, that I couldn't keep them straight. A family tree would be very helpful.The Husband List happens concurrently to the Marriage List. You need to have read The Marriage List to understand what is happening with Eleanor. This book is about one of Eleanor's sister-in-laws, Madeline Vivers. Madeline, Eleanor and Alice, Eleanor's twin sister are all coming out this season. While the three of them made a list of qualities that they want in a husband in the last book, Madeline is being pressured by her mother, to look for a title. Fortunately, her brother is her guardian, and he wants all of his sister's to have love matches. Harry Stern is a barrister. He sees Madeline and it is love at first sight, but he needs to convince Madeline. He receives a lot of helpful suggestions from his many relatives and he is smart enough to listen. It is a charming story of Harry's wooing Madeline and then their setting up of their new household. Witty dialogue.I read an ARC from the publisher via NetGally.com and this is my unbiased and voluntary review.",

                "reviewText": "The story is quite a lecture on how husbands or wifes were selected by women and men and their relatives, mainly with the help of specific lists, during the Regency era. Also included at great length and repeatedly mentioned were the formalities involved and adhered to, often causing serious troubles and tribulations. A mere mister wasn't as desireable as Dukes, Earls, or Barons, for instance, never mind how good-looking, smart, nice, or funny he might be. But some did marry for love, too, and, depending on their status, often became victims of nasty gossip among the 'ton', especially when a marriage turned out to be happy.Also included was lot's of text about the clothes, shoes, boots and hats people wore then and in what colors, and how often outfits needed to be changed during a day, and how many horses or carriages the upperclass deemed necessary to represent their status. No wonder so many servants were needed to manage it all successfully.I can recommend this story to all of those who have trouble falling asleep, since it worked better for me than camomile tea ever could!",
