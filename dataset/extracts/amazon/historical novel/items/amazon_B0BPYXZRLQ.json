As they raise their son, Olivier, they hold on to a tenuous promise for the future. Until the thunder of war sets off alarms in France.Staying behind to join the resistance, Giles sends Madeleine and Olivier to the relative safety of England, where Madeleine secures a job teaching French at a secondary school. Yet nowhere is safe. After a devastating twist of fate resulting in the loss of her son, Madeleine accepts a request from the ministry to aid in the war effort. Seizing the smallest glimmer of hope of finding Giles alive, she returns to France. If Madeleine can stop just one Nazi, it will be the start of a valiant path of revenge.Though her perseverance, defiance, and heart will be tested beyond imagining, no risk is too great for a brave wife and mother determined to fight and survive against inconceivable odds.

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying that historical fiction is my absolute favorite genre. This novel was one of my favorite reads in 2023! The story starts off in France and the beginning was so charming! I couldn\u2019t help but fall in love with the main characters immediately. As the storyline progresses, there is war, heartbreak, and resilience. The author gives us a glimpse into the events of WW2 which focuses on France\u2019s war with the Germans. In addition to this, we are also told about Australia\u2019s less talked about role in the war. This novel took me for an emotional rollercoaster ride and I loved every second of this book. 10/10 would recommend. Will definitely be buying more from this wonderful author.",
