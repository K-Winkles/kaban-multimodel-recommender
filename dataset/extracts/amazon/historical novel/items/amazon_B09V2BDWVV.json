I never imagined the release of my novel on a past oppression of the Ukrainian people would coincide with such a parallel tragedy. Ukrainians today are fighting for their country with a strength and tenacity that has captivated the world, but it is impossible to deny that history is repeating itself. It\u2019s horrifying, and we must do better. As the granddaughter of a Ukrainian refugee from WW2, the poignancy of this war devastates me. While I can\u2019t change history, we can all learn from it and do something to help the Ukrainian people today. My heart goes out to the brave Ukrainians defending their country, their culture, and their lives, both then and now. Slava Ukrayini! Erin Litteken",

I am grateful to Erin Litteken for enlightening me and other readers. I assume the majority of people have not heard of this atroctity or know that the Ukrainians have suffered many times over in the past.I definitely liked all the characters and felt like I came to know them. In my view, Katya was the most compelling character throughout her life.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve his\\her awareness of Ukraine's history in a story format. As a matter of fact, I just purchased this book as a gift to my granddaughter who is a freshman in college.Regarding the number of stars given in this review, I would have given 4 1\\2 if possible, but never below that number, so I rounded up. Why? Though it was very well written, informative and a page turner, I felt the resemblance of the granddaughter's situation to that of the a bit of Katya's was a bit too neat. Read The Memory Keeper of Kyiv; see what you think.",

How was it that so much venom exploded during this time period in these neighboring countries...exterminating millions of people at the behest of these diabolical men? This book illustrates the tragic circumstances in Ukrane to the simple peasants making their living and home in that country....telling to the world of readers just what they suffered, I for one, just didn't have any idea.This recounting told the appalling circumstances and the extraordinAry bravado of a family; would you have had the grit to make it through? Certainly this book is well written telling the reader just what we got to miss, liberally woven in with delightful bits of love and hope.",

I had seen a movie about this and read sone books about the subject. This author makes it so real you feel the emotions of the books characters. The author somehow placed you right in the middle of this horrific historical time . The same emotions that have you wondering about man\u2019s evilness toward their fellow man such as slavery in the south of the USA, the Holocaust in Europe, and the Holodomor . Stalin purposely starved the Ukrainian people to death. He made them work the fields and where they could touch none of the food. The world pretended not to know because they needed Russia to defeat the Germans. So millions of people just died of starvation . The world did nothing to Stalin. A great story of another of the worlds evil dictator.",

                "reviewText": "Outstanding story of the human spirit's desire to survive even in the most horrific circumstances. As an hobby historian, I was impressed with the attention to historical accuracy of information about he Holodomor, the artificial famine-genocide the Ukrainian Nation was subjected to in 1932-33. The author skillfully and successfully, allows the reader to repeatedly travel between two time periods, decades apart but closely stitched together by the horrors of the Holodomor experienced by the protagonist. Very timely story as it provides some insight as to why Ukraine in 2023 is again fighting for its existence , defending its people against an unconscionable aggressor. This is a beautifully written, heartbreaking story, historically strong and deserves a wide audience. There is so much here for all readers. It's a real page turner.",

                "reviewTitle": "Russian atrocities in Ukraine a century ago",
                "reviewText": "\u201cIf only one man dies of hunger, that is a tragedy. If millions die, that\u2019s only statistics.\u201d Joseph StalinI was drawn to this book as it is set in Ukraine and has at its theme Russian atrocities on this country. However, it\u2019s set not in 2022 but almost a century earlier, between 1928 and 1934.We often hear it said- \u201cHistory will show\u2026\u201d as though History is a reliable recorder of truth. The fact is, History is even more unreliable than newspapers as there are no eye-witnesses to challenge what it writes nor any to decry what it ignores.A painful example of history\u2019s untrustworthiness is the way it has ignored the man-made famine of Ukraine of the early 1930s under Soviet occupation. The world knows of the 6 million victims of the Holocaust. But not many are aware that Stalin\u2019s efforts to force collectivism and tamp down Ukrainian nationalism left an estimated 3.9 million dead.The Ukrainian famine\u2014known as the Holodomor- was caused entirely by Stalin\u2019s policy both to replace Ukraine\u2019s small farms with state-run collectives and punish independent-minded Ukrainians who posed a threat to his totalitarian authority.Ms Litteken\u2019s great grandmother was Ukaranian and this book is a fictionalised account of those dreadful days. It\u2019s based on deep research and includes stories from her own family.The story revolves around Katya, a teenage girl in a small village in eastern Ukraine. The happiness of her growing-up years was destroyed overnight as Stalin\u2019s gang arrived in her village to set up collectives to replace traditional land-holdings.From small farmers everyone became landless labourers and the entire produce of the village was taken away as state-property leaving just enough food to keep the villagers from starving. Unreasonable production targets were set and failure to meet them led to cut in rations and confiscation of livestock, vegetable patches and any other thing of value that the people possessed.The result of all this was that people began to die of hunger, setting off a vicious circle: as people weakened and died, production fell further. Stalin considered it sabotage and increased the atrocities. The result was the Holodomor.Unlike the Holocaust, the Holodomor happened within sight of the world. But the so-called champions of freedom needed Stalin on their side so they chose not to see.Walter Duranty, the New York Times correspondent was brazen enough to dismiss all talk of starvation in his report in 1933. He wrote-\u201cConditions are bad, but there is no famine.\u201d In fact he praised Stalin\u2019s collectivisation by writing \u201cYou can\u2019t make an omelette without breaking eggs.\u201dAnd this man was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on Eastern Europe!There are many in India who abuse the New York Times for its prejudiced reporting. But obviously dishonest reporting is not new to NYT.And what does it tell us about the Pulitzer?Getting back to the book, The Memory Keeper could have been depressing but it isn\u2019t. Whenever the scene in Ukraine gets dreary the author deftly shifts the narrative to Katya\u2019s great grand-daughter Cassie in Illinois. The result is a very engaging and captivating book.",
