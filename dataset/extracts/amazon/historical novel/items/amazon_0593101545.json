More than a biography of a remarkable woman, this book is a portrait of an era when her struggles and achievements have continued to ripple into our world today. The story of Ms. Greene is compelling as the authors pay tribute to her life and legacy. The reader comes away with a heightened awareness of her world and our world where the struggle for equality and dignity continue. It's a story I could not put down and even drew me to the accounts of how the two authors came to collaborate on this project. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I am happy I read this book because it made me aware of Belle da Costa Greene and her accomplishments. She was an amazing woman. After doing my own research and looking further into Ms. da Costa Greene's life, I learned so much more about her than what was written in this fictionalized account of her life. The book did NOT do her justice. I think much of what was written would have embarrassed her. This fictionalized version of her life took great liberties with the truth. As with all fictionalized accounts, the author(s) can only guess what happened and what was said in most instances about which they write if these things were not actually documented.I am an avid reader. My knowledge of slavery, the aftermath for the former slaves/'freed' people, as well as life in our world today is extensive, and I have read widely on these topics.It seems to me that Ms. Christopher Murray, in writing what Belle's mother (Genevieve Ida Fleet) 'felt' - and I quote (end of page 227 in paperback version of book) \"She gave up the identity she'd loved to live among people she abhorred, ONLY for the betterment of her children.\" Really? Ms. Greene's mother ABHORRED Caucasians (all Caucasians?). Obviously, her life was not always an easy one, but she did reap the benefits of her daughter's intelligence, abilities and success (and the largesse of J.P. Morgan). Yes, Ms. da Costa Greene deserved what he gave her, but let's not forget that she was a working WOMAN in the early 1900's, and most bosses would not have remunerated a valued and deserving employee as he had. I doubt Mrs. Fleet loathed him - just one person as an example. So, living among all those Mrs. Fleet despised couldn't have been so awful. Actually, I don't think she despised them at all. Being that this comment was not taken from any diaries or other printed format, it can only be deduced that these are Ms. Christopher Murray's feelings, and not Mrs. Fleet's.The afterword by Ms. Benedict points out how removed she's been and protected by her white privilege. So it is fortunate for her that she collaborated with Ms. Christopher Murray, who showed her how misguided she'd been all her life. It is unfortunate that she chose to mention George Floyd as a victim/hero. Perhaps Ms. Benedict might consider doing some research on the person HE was, a very poor example of what I think she was trying to show.",
