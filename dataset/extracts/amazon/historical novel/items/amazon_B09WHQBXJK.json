Rachel is a Jew in Poland studying to be a doctor and falls in love with a handsome military officer, Johann, who just happens to be Catholic. Irena is a Polish Catholic who falls in love with Andre, his twin brother. Johann\u2019s mother is very angry when she is told of the marriage of Johann and proves Anti-Semitism is alive and well. She refuses to recognize the marriage of Johann & Rachel. Hitler\u2019s reign of terror begins as his forces of evil are unleashed on Poland. What follows is a story of the good people who help Irena and Rachel survive 6 years of cruelty. Even after the Germans are gone and the death camps have been revealed, the Polish people continue their persecution of the survivors of those concentration camps. This forces Irena to accept Rachel\u2019s plan to emigrate to Israel because of Ilona, the child of Johann and Rachel and Barauch, a young orphaned boy who Irena and Rachel have raised. It is the only place that these children will ever be accepted.",
