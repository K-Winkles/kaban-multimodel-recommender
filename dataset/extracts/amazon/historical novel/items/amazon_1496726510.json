She had to leave behind a husband and two daughters. Her time at Carville has been challenging due to her thinking she has been misdiagnosed. In order to leave the facility she needs to test negative 12 times straight.It was a good read I also did the audible which I feel like the narrator did a terrible job. All her \u201ccharacters\u201d sounded exactly the same in a manly voice. If they had gone with someone else that can actually do different voices it would\u2019ve been better. 3 stars mainly due to the narrator sucking.Book 4 starsNarrator 2 stars",

                "reviewText": "It is interesting to get an insight into life for someone with this disease in the 1920's. The story follows Mirielle as she is diagnosed and sent to a specialist hospital. Although her story is sad, the emotion didn't come through in the writing. Unfortunately it is sometimes hard to sympathise with her as she is a self-centred character. However, I enjoyed reading the book and meeting the other characters.",
