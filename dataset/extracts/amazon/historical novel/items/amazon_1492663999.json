While I could really only read a chapter or 3 at a time, I really wanted to know what was going to happen with the characters. The action isn't the core of the book but the development and growth of Ellis, Lilly, and the various relationships in the book. As a reader, I really began to care about them. While atypical of what I usually enjoy reading, I found this worthy of my time.",

Ellis Reed, A society reporter for the Philadelphia Examiner, saw the two boys sitting there and took their picture. This was the start to a story that broke my heart but also took me on a journey through sadness and happiness. A story about parents' love for their children and the way they would do anything for them, with a bit of romance thrown in.The love of a mother for her children is the true soul of this novel. A real tear jerker and highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Before I begin the actual review, I have to say this story broke my heart in so many ways.It all began with a photojournalist seeing a sign reading \u201cchildren for sale\u201d on his way back to the Philadelphia Examiner, where he worked as a society reporter. Although uneasy, he continued on his journey. However the sign stayed in his thoughts. With the Great Depression barely over, he could not imagine what that family was going through.Although the story he had written about the sign and the children had given him a huge break in his career, he knew it was wrong. He knew he had to go back. What he found when he returned shocked and horrified him. He made a split second decision which changed his life forever.Placing his career at risk, he took bold steps to correct his mistake, along with Lily, secretary to his boss. She refused to allow Ellis to give up. Lily had her own secret for wanting to help him.About parents\u02bc love for their children and the way they will do anything, even putting their own lives in jeopardy, is a major theme of the book. At the soul of the story is the love of a mother for her children. More than one mother in this case. And a father, whose own grief almost kept him from having any kind of life.Although Ellis was (mostly) blameless as the result of his story, his efforts to rectify his error came to the point where I truly feared for Ellis's life.The characters all seemed very real, even those who barely had a few brief passages. I did not detect a single doubt about any of the motivations of any of them. (Even the Model T Ellis drove was a cantankerous character.)The journey taken by the book gave me great joy and great sadness. There are thrills here you will never see coming.It gives me happiness to highly recommend this book. All through those sad times there are also happy times that creep in, sometimes making the reader finding unexpected tears. Cherish both as they will make your life much richer for having read this book, rightfully on best seller lists (and a movie).I am looking forward to finding the rest of this author's books and reading them as quickly as I read this one.",
