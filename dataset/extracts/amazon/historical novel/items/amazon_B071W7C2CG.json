There were times where the letter writing felt a little unnatural eg teaching us about Irish history that these two women would have already known about. That could be easily overlooked. I did however, struggle with the ending. It felt sudden and a little frustrating. I understand it\u2019s mr Carnegie, so they couldn\u2019t be together. But she couldn\u2019t write him a letter a few years later? Meet him in the library? Something? It felt sudden and like it needed a proper sense of closure. She had also revealed her family\u2019s address to him in the argument so I find it hard that he didn\u2019t discover her before she left town. And what did it do to the relationship with his mother? So many questions",

                "reviewTitle": "An Interesting Read",
                "reviewText": "This is another classic tale of a poor servant girl catching the eye of her rich master. However although our heroine, Clara, the ladies maid is fictional, her rich employer is not. He is Andrew Carnegie. So the author is constrained by history and one knows right from the start that the romance, such as it is, will never go anywhere and that is one of the novels flaws. Although the book is very well written and researched, the plot lacks drama. The romance is very chaste and is not imbued with much emotion and the premise that this woman might have influenced Carnegie\u2019s business and philanthropic causes, really seems a bit far fetched. I also would have liked a more imaginative ending. As it is the book ends on a rather flat note. However Andrew Carnegie certainly was a vary interesting person and so I found this book most informative.",
