        "description": "The Dirty Parts of the Bible\u2014originally a #1 Amazon bestseller in Humorous Fiction\u2014is now a graphic novel!Remus, Michigan. Easter Sunday, 1936.When Tobias Henry\u2014the preacher\u2019s son\u2014ditches church to go fishing, he unwittingly sets off a chain of events that leaves his family devastated, forcing him to travel to Texas in search of a long-buried treasure.Based on the bestselling novel by Sam Torode and masterfully illustrated by Tina Ritchie, The Dirty Parts of the Bible recasts the ancient Jewish tale of Tobias (found in the Book of Tobit) as a uniquely American story blending humor, adventure, and romance with a spiritual quest.More than an adaptation, this is a complete re-visioning of the story\u2014full of surprises even for those who\u2019ve read the original book.This Kindle e-book is formatted with Guided View, which allows you to zoom in and swipe through the story one panel at a time, creating a cinematic experience.Praise for the Original Prose Version of The Dirty Parts of the Bible: \u201cWhile the title suggests a raunchy read, this rich and soulful novel is actually a rather well-done coming-of-age tale steeped in wanderlust and whimsy that at times recalls The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\u201d \u2014Publishers Weekly\u201cSam Torode takes on God, sex, family, and love in his debut comic novel. It's a fun read, even for those who are still in the fold.\u201d \u2014The Nashville Scene\u201cLots of laughs, a few tears, and characters that are pure joy.\u201d \u2014Front Street Reviews\u201cThe Dirty Parts of the Bible might just be the long-awaited Great American Novel.... We experience the odyssey of a young man who searches for lost treasure, his identity, and the alchemy of transforming lust to love.\u201d \u2014John M. Perkins, New York Times bestselling author",

It\u2019s a fun read; overall the experience was somewhere between a novel and a movie, leaving plenty of space for my imagination to roam.",

If you come from a Christian background as I do you'll be hilariously reminded of all its core problems, while also being empowered to remember through Torode's gifted storytelling the essential reasons for our human life on earth. I came to this not having read the extremely popular original novel, though now I want to. Tina Ritchie's illustrations add color and verve and dimension to this delightful narrative which has something for everyone: theology, history, romance, humor. My favorite character (Craw) sums it up completely for me: \"The things you can't see are the only things that make life worth living...all your thoughts and ideas. Everything in your heart. Beauty, goodness, truth. And best of all, love. Can't see em. Can't touch em. But they're real as rain.\"I'll say Amen to that.Also Sam Torode is one of the most undersung spiritual authors on the planet. Read everything by him if you take your search seriously.",

                "reviewText": "Sometimes, very rarely, a book comes along that stays with you for years. You might not remember all the details, but you remember the way you felt reading the book. The Dirty Parts of the Bible is that book for me. I first purchased the original Dirty Parts as an eBook way back in 2011. Since then I've bought it in paperback and hardback, and as soon as the graphic novel came out, I bought it. (For the record, I've never read a graphic novel before this one!) Like the original, the graphic novel pushes every book button I have. Each quirky character is imbued with such a special spirit that you can't help loving them (except maybe the main character's father). The plot weaves together an ancient Jewish story, fact, legend, superstition, hopes, dreams, joy, and despair into one very fine cloth held together by stitches of laughter. The ending is completely unexpected but totally believable. The book will leave you with a good feeling long after you've read it.The collaboration between the author, Sam Torode, and the illustrator, Tina Ritchie, turned out fabulously! The drawings of young Tobias exude hopeful naivete, and Craw looks rakish and wise at the same time. Sarah takes turns between being skeptical, coquettish, hopeful, and convinced. Of course, being a graphic novel, the plot isn't exactly the same as the original, and it was fun spotting the differences. In a stroke of genius, Torode divided the novel into Biblically appropriate sections which follow the storyline to a T: Genesis, Exodus, Psalms & Proverbs, The Promised Land, Angels & Demons, and Revelation. Quite fittingly, the epilogue is titled The Song of Songs.Dirty Parts comes as both a normal graphic novel as well as a \"silent movie\" version which consists of all the pictures but none of the words. I ordered the regular format because I wanted to take it to a book club discussion of the original novel (which Mr. Torode was nice enough to attend via Zoom) because the silent movie version wouldn't get there in time. Guess what's on my Christmas wish list!",

Set in 1930s America, this is historic fiction at its finest.My own spiritual self discovery over the years has morphed and evolved from the old standard God fearing and bible thumping fundamentalism that kept me awake at night, fretting my eternal fate...to a faith rooted purely in love.I cannot recommend both the novel and now graphic novel of this wonderful and joyous tale.Thank you Sam!I ordered the hardback edition from Amazon that also includes a silent movie edition of the tale as well.I cannot recommend this book enough!

I recommend you try.When I leaned that the graphic novel version was out, I had to see it! It is a great representation of the book!
