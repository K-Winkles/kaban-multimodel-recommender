                "reviewText": "It was on a trip to Italy with my family when I was 13 years old that I first saw Michelangelo\u2019s sculpture of David. The up-close image is still strong in my mind. David\u2019s serene, serious face, the still before the storm, just before he will hurl his shepherd stones at the bully Goliath. More than 500 years since Michelangelo carved it. The physical form emits glorious beauty and grace even now. Imagine then how this historical novel is compelling, pulling us back to just before\u2014before the statue was carved, before it was even conceived of, before Michelangelo was a master artist and sculptor. As the story unfolds, cleverly told through the eyes and experiences of a rival of Michelangelo, Jacopo Torni, we see the political backdrop, the stresses of daily living, the role artists played in 16th century Italian culture. We see how Michelangelo challenges the status of the older Da Vinci. We root for Michelangelo\u2014and Jacopo too\u2014to attempt to bring an idealized concept into physical form through their art. Author Morelli\u2019s vivid world-building, enriched with careful research, brings us front and center to David\u2019s creation. And now I must book a ticket to see David in person again!

                "reviewText": "Having been impressed by the author's \"The Stolen Lady\", a very impressive discussion of the creation and later fate of the \"Mona Lisa\",and having admired the famous sculpture of \"David\" by Michelangelo, I looked forward to this book. I was somewhat disappointed. Based on the friendship between Michelangelo and Jacopo Torni during the period of the creation of \"David\", the narration is basically by Jacopo. Jacopo has a major problem of an addiction to gambling and losing, which is holding him back from any success in life at this time. This is OK, but the author, in my opinion, spends too many words in repetitious discussions of his gambling episodes to the point of becoming boring. Once the problem had been identified, it should have been possible to move on to the main story of the creation of the \"David\". In any event there is a lot of interesting information here about life in Florence in the XVI Century and the creation of the \"Giant\". One can sort of skim through the gambling stuff and still enjoy the book. The author is worth that effort.",

                "reviewText": "While I enjoyed the other novels by Laura Morelli, this one was very difficult to get through. I appreciate her desire to explore the friendship between Jacapo and Michelangelo, but as a reader I had hoped it was going to be more a story about Michelangelohimself. Therefore, I was disappointed. Also, the long and boring,in some cases descriptions were very tedious and made me want to finish this book much sooner. Not her best!",

                "reviewText": "The author does a great job of telling a story about one of the world\u2019s greatest works of art. Rather than telling it from the point of view of Michelangelo, she tells it from the POV of his friend.Michelangelo was notoriously secretive and solitary in his work,and Morelli uses that to the story\u2019s advantage. The narrator, Jacopo, tells us about the world of Florence in the 16th century,the block of marble used for the David (more interesting than you\u2019d think), how artists were trained, what people were saying about the David, in an interesting story. We see his friendship with the artist Michelangelo, who was irascible, grubby, proud, and often infuriating. This is a pretty accurate view of Michelangelofrom history. I recommend this book for people who like historical fiction and stories about great art/artists.It is a clean book in that there is no swearing, no violence, no sex. Jacopo is a gambler, so there are scenes of taverns, drinking, cards and betting. I would still recommend the book for teensbecause it also shows how Jacopo\u2019s life improves once he givesup those things. But the focus is really on the art.",

                "reviewText": "Although the title \"The Giant\" refers to Michelangelo's huge marble sculpture of David, the true story is about the friendship of Michelangelo and Jacopo. While Michelangelo is gifted with artistic commissions, his friend, Jacopo, is having lower level artistic success and falls into gambling debt. Additionally, Jacopo feels anxiety and pressure to save money because his parents have left his sister, Lucia, without a dowry to marry. I found myself caught up in the story as Jacopo struggles with his gambling addiction, jealousy of his successful friend and low self esteem. Much of the story is about the lack of communication and the untold secrets that exist within friendships and families. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story that I believe has deeper levels than may be immediately apparent. Highly recommend this one!",
