                "reviewText": "This novel by J.M. Nunes brilliantly presents the story of the Saracen invasion and occupation of Spain. During this time, Spain was introduced to a whole new world of culture and science. While Europe was in a \"Dark Age\", the Saracens promoted literacy, geometry, and architecture in Spain. Their skill is evident in the Alhambra, which is definitely worth a visit. The author beautifully recounts the story of the Spanish people in Saracen Storm. From the very first page until the end, the book draws us in. We can only hope that Nunes will write more novels in the future.",

                "reviewText": "I confess that I didn't finish this book. The battle and fight scenes reminded me of a 1960's movie where the actors didn't really know what they were doing. It was tolerable until the part where the romance began and then I just couldn't go on. It's obvious the rest of the book is going to involve a lot of mooning about Valentina.I'm a big fan of historical fiction, but I think Christian Cameron has made me notice and imagine fights step by step. Reading this book is kind of like reading Dewey Lambdin after finishing the Aubrey Maturin series. Or ordering Domino's the day after you get back from Italy. Best to think it through first.",

                "reviewText": "An enjoyable read focused on the life of Spanish hero, Pelayo, who I had never heard of and of whom not a great deal, it would seem, is known. He is credited with leading resistance to the invasion by the Moors and keeping northern Spain out of their grasp. It\u2019s a good \u2019swashbuckling\u2019 kind of tale, albeit I could guess at the start of most chapters what was going to happen next. My main gripe is that it presents the invaders as uncultured barbarians, even though they would establish a society way in advance of anything else in Europe and would show religious tolerance, something which the Spaniards did not when they reconquered Spain centuries later. Still, this isn't a history book but entertainment and at that it certainly succeeds.",
