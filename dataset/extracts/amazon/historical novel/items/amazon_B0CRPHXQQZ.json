Violet decides she wants to break free from her usual wallflower status. She lacks confidence in herself to pursue her attraction to Xander.The Dark Duke also is still dealing with issues concerning his past betrothed which he refuses to discuss. The author at this point created a sympathetic Duke who doesn't quite know how to close that door after five years.It was so easy to care for both the hero and heroine. The pages will fly by as you continue to build your love for both of these characters knowing the betrothed being a key surprising character twist who finally appears later in the story. I wasn't sure how the author was going to resolve all the issues each of these characters created. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this page turner love story. It was easy to relate with this tale because we all have secrets and lack the trust needed to move forward.",

As a result he had become a recluse, but when someone starts to write a novel based on him as the central character, Xander is enraged and determined to find the culprit.Lady Violet, labelled a wallflower, confesses that she is the one behind the story and to make amends she agrees to portray Xander in a more positive light and become engaged to him for a month to try to salvage his reputation.I enjoyed the story with its witty banter and humour and I also found the main protagonists very likeable. This is an enjoyable story well worth reading.I received an ARC copy and this is my unbiased opinion.",

                "reviewText": "A chance meeting, a strange attraction, writing and publishing a multiple chapter story that was patterned after Xander who the ton had labeled the Duke of Darkness. Lady Violet had not meant to cause Xander any more distress but her stories had enraged him and he had promised himself that he would find and punish the man who was doing this to him. Little did he know it was Violet until she came up to him and professed her apology for causing him distress. He then made a bargain with her that if she became engaged to him for one month, and painted him in a better light in her story, then he would forgive her and then the ton would realize that he was not the monster they had labeled him to be. This was an enjoyable, funny at times, steamy and captivating story. It has the drama at the end that all stories have but also shows the hearts and souls of the main characters and how they really feel about each other when all of the shadows are brightened and revealed.",

But did he?The ton sees her as a respectable wallflower who would never associate with the Dark Duke. But is that true?Although I have read many Sally Vixen's books, I have mixed feelings about Her Dark Duke.Overall, the story is interesting. The plot is somewhat believable and the ending is very good. It's the in between that has me undecided.I liked Violet (heroine), but I just never came around to liking Xander (duke-hero). To me, he missed the hero mark. I was also put off by Violets friends, but I really liked her sister. I liked that there was enough dialogue to balance the character's thoughts and the scene action. But, I think the balance would have been better with a bit more humor and a little less sex.Content 411: This book contains both secular and religious swearing. It also contains described consensual sex scenes.",

Xander isn't pleased, he's enraged and swears to find the culprit for darkening his name more so than it already is. He just had no idea that the man he planning to confront, was actually a wallflower.Violet didn't mean to cause any harm or distress to the Duke, she is rather fascinated by the alluring man. She decides to find him and make amends.Upon their meeting a bargain is made, she will play at being his betrothed to help him with his tarnished reputation.Their journey to a HEA all starts with a bargain, which leads to getting caught, stopping a scandal, sparks flying, and a happy ever after.A truly enjoyable read. I loved the Strength both H&H have. Xander is dark but not really bad, alluring, and strong. Violet is intriguing, daring, and very unique.I enjoyed all the aspects of the story and watching these two fall for each other. It was a clever plot, fast paced, and funI received an ARC from the author. All opinions expressed are my own",
