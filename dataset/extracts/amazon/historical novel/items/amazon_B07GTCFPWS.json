        "description": "\"Readers will easily fall for Sophie and Ned in their gaslit surroundings.\" \u2014Library Journal, starred reviewA Courtship of ConvenienceSophie Appersett is quite willing to marry outside of her class to ensure the survival of her family. But the darkly handsome Mr. Edward Sharpe is no run-of-the-mill London merchant. He's grim and silent. A man of little emotion--or perhaps no emotion at all. After two months of courtship, she's ready to put an end to things.A Last Chance for LoveBut severing ties with her taciturn suitor isn't as straightforward as Sophie envisioned. Her parents are outraged. And then there's Charles Darwin, Prince Albert, and that dratted gaslight. What's a girl to do except invite Mr. Sharpe to Appersett House for Christmas and give him one last chance to win her? Only this time there'll be no false formality. This time they'll get to know each other for who they really are.",

                "reviewText": "OVERALL STAR RATING: 4/5CLEAN RATING: 5/5My first Mimi Matthews read and it did not disappoint!Set in 1861 Victorian London, this novella follows the story of Sophie and Ned. They had been courting for two months when Sophie decided to end their relationship, confessing that she felt they weren\u2019t at all compatible with each other. This book brings to light all the pressures of wealth and social status during the Victorian era. I can\u2019t even imagine being pressured to marry someone simply on these things alone. Luckily Sophie has courage enough to stand up for what her heart believes in. Little did she realize though, perhaps, Ned WAS what her heart desired\u2026only they hadn\u2019t taken the time to get to know each other very well at all.Ned was so consumed by following The Gentlemen\u2019s Guide to Etiquette that he didn\u2019t let any of the REAL him be known. Let the lesson be learned\u2026that even today\u2026self help books aren\u2019t ALWAYS the answer. Lol There is hope for a second chance romance once Sophie and Ned realize they didn\u2019t go about their courtship properly the first time.Sophie\u2019s dad is obsessed with his estate and modernizing everything from the lighting to the plumbing \u2013 all while draining his daughter\u2019s dowries to pay for these lavish upgrades. While you will likely find yourself wanting to scream at the father for his poor choices, there is a deep personal reason behind his behavior. Not that it completely excuses what he was doing, but it did bring more understanding. Just enough family drama and romance balanced together to keep you turning page after page.I loved the way the author weaved in real life events such as the death of Prince Albert. The perfect holiday novella for fans of historical fiction and a great lesson on learning to live life authentically.*Please note there are a few uses of the word d*mn.",

I would have liked to have more written after where it ended.The story goes where a couple are courting for a few months, but the woman finds them to not be compatible enough, for her beau does not speak much and she speaks too much. She wants to know what he is thinking more. Right when they break it off, they start to get to know one another way more. Her family is having a party at the holidays and invite his family to join them. Her father is very much into new technology coming around, so he just had gaslights put all over the home, which was not cheap. More about that is mentioned as you read the book. It was not bad, but I just feel I would have liked to have more!!",

                "reviewText": "This is my first Mimi Mathews book and I was highly impressed. I loved the miss-understanding between Sophie and Ned and the will they/won't they of their relationship. It was interesting to see how Sophie and Ned saw the same circumstances SO different; they each perceived and assumed something about the other that was completely wrong, thus creating a little drama and fun. I also loved the Christmas festivities and the few references to the reason for the season. Overall, this was a fun and insightful Victorian novel.As others have mentioned, there are several references to Charles Darwin's \"On the Origins of Species.\" Though I do not believe the evolution of man that he speculated, I did like how Sophie likened it to her own circumstances; I found it quite moving. Sophie recognized that we all need to change and adapt to our differing circumstances and that, as humans, we have CHOICE. She often says that we need to progress or we will be left behind. It reminded me of The Bellamy Brothers\u2019 song, \u201cOld Hippie\u201d...\"Should he hang on to the old, should he grab on to the new?\" We all must change and grow and use our choices to become better people, and I feel that Sophie took this to heart as she tried to put the judgments and prejudices of the nobility behind her and embrace classes other than her own. The author uses this to effectively portray the tough transition from the Regency era to the Victorian era, and the changes the industrial revolution brought to the English people (not to mention, at the time, Darwin was quite the controversial piece, so it\u2019s fitting for the novel time period).There were a few mild curse words (h*ll and dam*, and for the English, bloody) that actually flowed with the feeling of the book quite nicely. There were also a couple instances that were borderline taking the Lord's name in vain. I say borderline because, while they weren't strictly blasphemous (in fact I don\u2019t believe the author meant them as such), they were more casual than I would like.CONTENT: mild language (see above), mild kissing, no innuendo or intimacy (proper romance)",

The way Matthews potrayed the Victorian era is very admirable.The romance between the two lead charecters are very neat and interesting.The development of each of the charecters are something to look forward to.The holiday theme was the cherry on the top. It will give you the cozy, country house, Victorian Christmas feeling \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01I'll 100% recommend you to read it \u2764",

Tambi\u00e9n es una novela muy bien escrita, que te engancha de una forma sutil y te deja con una sonrisa al final. Unos personajes muy bien creados y una trama sin grandes altibajos ni imprevistos, pero que sin embargo se disfruta de principio a fin.Seguir\u00e9 a la autora.",
