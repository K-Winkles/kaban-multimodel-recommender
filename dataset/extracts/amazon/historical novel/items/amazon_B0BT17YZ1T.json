        "description": "A stunning portrait of an African princess raised in Queen Victoria\u2019s court and adapting to life in Victorian England\u2014based on the real-life story of a recently rediscovered historical figure, Sarah Forbes Bonetta.With a brilliant mind and a fierce will to survive, Sarah Forbes Bonetta, a kidnapped African princess, is rescued from enslavement at seven years old and presented to Queen Victoria as a \u201cgift.\u201d To the Queen, the girl is an exotic trophy to be trotted out for the entertainment of the royal court and to showcase Victoria\u2019s magnanimity. Sarah charms most of the people she meets, even those who would cast her aside. Her keen intelligence and her aptitude for languages and musical composition helps Sarah navigate the Victorian era as an outsider given insider privileges.But embedded in Sarah\u2019s past is her destiny. Haunted by visions of destruction and decapitations, she desperately seeks a place, a home she will never run from, never fear, a refuge from nightmares and memories of death.From West Africa to Windsor Castle to Sierra Leone, to St. James's Palace, and the Lagos Colony, Sarah juggles the power and pitfalls of a royal upbringing as she battles racism and systematic oppression on her way to living a life worthy of a Yoruba princess.Based on the real life of Queen Victoria\u2019s Black goddaughter, Sarah Forbes Bonetta\u2019s story is a sweeping saga of an African princess in Victorian England and West Africa, as she searches for a home, family, love, and identity.

                "reviewText": "This was rich in detail and history but the pacing really didn\u2019t work for me. I was drawn in from the beginning but once I hit the halfway mark I found myself losing interest.I don\u2019t think historical fiction should only revolve around struggle or survival but this didn\u2019t hit like I wanted. The first few chapters were complex and intense with Sarah who at the time was Princess Aina watching the decapitation of her family, becoming enslaved, and searching for her brother who she knew survived the invasion. But once Sarah was given to Queen Victoria we see her conform with her new surroundings which is where my interest began to decline.The narrative explores Sarah\u2019s personal and emotional struggles as she battles racism and systematic oppression, attempts to preserve the memory of her family, and find where she belongs in society. I did enjoy Sarah\u2019s character she was very smart and brave even from a young age. Her brilliance and various talents is what provided her the royal privilege she\u2019d become accustomed to.Overall, the book was okay minus the pacing. I think the writing was decent and the author did well capturing the characters life and the era in which events occurred. So, if you\u2019re into historical fiction you might enjoy this. Special thanks to the author and @williammorrowbooks for the gifted copy!!!Rating: 3.75/5\u2b50\ufe0f",

Though the details were often quite shocking, I could picture Aina, aka Sarah, moving through life and captivity as a child, then showing amazing adaptability and aptitude, as well as just the right amount of stubbornness while she was in England. So many hard things happened to her, and yet she never gave up and never seemed bitter. This is the kind of based-on-truth story that needs telling right now, so good job to the publisher and to the author for this work. A definite recommended read.",

The novel skillfully navigates her journey from captivity to the glittering court of Queen Victoria, where she was raised in the public eye, encountering challenges, privilege, and the harsh realities of racism. Bryce's writing succeeds in bringing to life the fascinating story of Bonetta, making this novel an enlightening read.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book.

                "reviewText": "Before reading this novel, I had no clue that Queen Victoria had an African goddaughter/ward. The more I read, the more I wanted to know. Sarah Forbes Bonetta was born Aina, the youngest child of a Yoruba King. She watched her family get killed by a rival tribe, was taken hostage to either be sold as a slave or sacrificed. Luckily, she was spared those fates when she was given to a captain as a gift for Queen Victoria setting her on an unexpected path and an extraordinary life.With THE OTHER PRINCESS, Denny S. Bryce plunged me into a world that was familiar but, also, unfamiliar, as viewed by a character of non-European descent who had no prior contact with Europeans. The story is amazing, Sarah Forbes Bonetta was a strong, determined woman who faced so many obstacles as an African in Britain.The best historical novels are those that inspire you to learn more, and Bryce has done that with this novel. THE OTHER PRINCESS is well-written and will keep you enthralled from beginning to end. I hated putting it down for any reason.Thank you to the publisher for the opportunity to read an advanced copy of the novel.
