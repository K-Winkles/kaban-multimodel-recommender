I'm grateful to learn that such righteous individuals as Marco did such amazing things during the divisive and difficult time of the internment of Japanese Americans. What I also love so much is how Josh Tuininga brings to life the richness of Sephardic Jewish life in Seattle including the pearls of Ladino family expressions and community worship. The Sephardic dishes left me hungry (as did Sam Akiyama's offered bite of Salmon sashimi), but that's just me? :-) This is a graphic novel to cherish and share with your family and friends.",
