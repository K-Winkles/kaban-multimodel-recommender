Because everyone has to name their children \"king & queen\" names there is so many repeats. It seems to me that Queen's were treated as baby maker's as when they had their babies, they were given to a wet nurse and Nanny and moved to the children's House. What a tragic situation with the two young prince's in the tower, who really killed the next in line for the throne? So many books an theories on the subject, one will never know. This author brought me too tears to many times, would recommend to any historical fan.",

                "reviewText": "WOW! This book is phenomenal! It is gripping, intriguing, full of history, emotional, and so much more! Whenever I picked up \"The Last White Rose\", I was whisked back in time, and went on such a journey with this story.Alison Weir is one of my absolute favorite authors, and her books are must-reads for me! In her historical fiction novels, she seamlessly blends history and fiction, brings to life historical figures in such a unique and dimensional way, and her storytelling and world-building is spectacular. From the first page to the last, I always feel immersed in the world of the book, and \"The Last White Rose\" is no different!This book centers around the life of Elizabeth of York, who became the first Tudor Queen. Throughout, you really feel what Elizabeth is feeling, and come to understand her relationships with those around her. She truly was such a strong and incredible woman.If you enjoy historical fiction novels, I highly recommend this book! It kept me turning the pages late into the night, and I can't wait to read what Ms. Weir writes next.Thank you so much to Random House Publishing Group-Ballantine and NetGalley for the ARC of this book, it is unputdownable! All opinions expressed in this review are my own.",

                "reviewText": "Alison Weir is a master storyteller! In her latest, The Last White Rose, she explores the life of Elizabeth of York, the first Tudor Queen and mother to the infamous Henry VIII.Her writing is flawless and the pace of the story is even and quick. You get hooked from very early on during Elizabeth's childhood. Her father Edward faces opposition and betrayal from the inside of his court and this turmoil had to have left a lasting mark on the young princess. She navigates through trials and tribulations, as we all must in life, and ended up matriarch to a great family of rulers who has left their mark on England and the world.If you love Historical Fiction, check out this and all of Alison's fiction offerings. I love her non-fiction, also. Her books are never dry or boring and will engage you, as this one did for me, from beginning to end. If you are looking for accuracy and great research, then look no further.",

True it is based on history, but even Alison acknowledges there are some mad up characters. Still it is a really good read and you feel for Elizabeth for all her woes, but she does come across as a strong woman. Recommended.",
