Keeping busy has always helped her cope, which she\u2019s been doing since her eighteen-year-old son, Erik, mysteriously vanished on a boat in Puget Sound over thirty years ago.Tova becomes acquainted with curmudgeonly Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus living at the aquarium. Marcellus knows more than anyone can imagine but wouldn\u2019t dream of lifting one of his eight arms for his human captors\u2014until he forms a remarkable friendship with Tova.Ever the detective, Marcellus deduces what happened the night Tova\u2019s son disappeared. And now Marcellus must use every trick his old invertebrate body can muster to unearth the truth for her before it\u2019s too late.Shelby Van Pelt\u2019s debut novel is a gentle reminder that sometimes taking a hard look at the past can help uncover a future that once felt impossible.

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A remarkable story",
                "reviewText": "What a wonderful surprise this was! I thought Remarkably Bright Creatures was a story about a woman and an octopus, but it turned out to be so much more than that. This is Shelby Van Pelt\u2019s first book, and I don\u2019t think a debut has affected me like this since I read Hollow Kingdom, another story that unfolds through the eyes of an animal. The story has a bit of magical realism to it, in the sense that parts of it are told from the octopus\u2019s point of view, but otherwise it\u2019s simply a delightful tale about family and connections that had me ugly crying by the end of the book.In the first chapter we meet Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus on display in the Sowell Bay Aquarium near Puget Sound. Marcellus has been in captivity for 1,299 days, and based on his life expectancy of about four years, he believes he only has a handful of days left to live. His dreary days in a small glass enclosure are broken up by secret nighttime excursions, as Marcellus is extremely smart and has found a way out of his tank.Tova Sullivan is a seventy-year-old woman who has been working nights at the aquarium as a cleaning lady for the past two years. Tova knows how to remove the hundreds of fingerprints on the tank walls and can polish the floors to a brilliant shine. She\u2019s also quite fond of the sea creatures she encounters each night, especially Marcellus, and the two have formed an unusual bond since Tova saved Marcellus one night after he escaped and became entangled in a bunch of electrical cords.Next, we meet Cameron Cassmore, a thirty-year-old man who is drifting through life with no real purpose. Cameron lives in California, and one day his aunt gives him a box of his estranged mother\u2019s things. Inside the box he finds a photo and an old class ring, clues that could lead to the identity of his father, a man he never knew. Cameron hops on a plane to Washington state, convinced the man he thinks is his father\u2014a rich real estate tycoon\u2014will be so distraught over abandoning his son, he\u2019ll shower Cam with money. At least that\u2019s the plan.Finally, Ethan Mack is the owner of Sowell Bay\u2019s Shop-Way, the local grocery store. Ethan has known Tova for years and secretly has a crush on her, but Tova is much too distant to notice his interest. When Cameron shows up at the Shop-Way looking for a job, Ethan directs him to his friend who manages the aquarium, which is how Cameron and Tova meet.Tying all these characters together is Marcellus, a remarkably bright octopus with a penchant for stealing and hoarding the treasures he finds after hours on the aquarium floor, and who just might be able to bring two people together who need each other\u2014but don\u2019t yet realize it.Van Pelt\u2019s chapters alternate among all these characters and introduce a slew of side characters as well, each one vitally important to the story. At first, we don\u2019t realize how each character is connected to the next, but slowly the author reveals her secrets until the stunned reader begins to understand the depth of these connections. Each character is given a detailed backstory that becomes very important to the plot. Tova\u2019s story in particular was heart wrenching, as she has experienced quite a bit of loss in her life and finds herself mostly alone in her twilight years. Luckily she belongs to a group of women who call themselves the Knit-Wits, and the four of them meet weekly to eat, drink, gossip and support each other. Tova came to America from Sweden as a little girl, so the story is filled with details about growing up with her Swedish mother and father. Even the Dala horses her mother collected play a part in the story, and I found these little details added so much richness.At first I couldn\u2019t figure out how Cameron fit it, but once he arrives in Sowell Bay and meets Ethan and Tova, his story takes on new meaning. Cameron meets a woman named Avery who also plays a vital part in filling in some of the missing pieces about Cameron\u2019s father, and I loved the way the author gave even the most insignificant side characters meaning and purpose.Van Pelt infuses her story with so many emotional moments and themes. We see how the Knit-Wits are going through the aging process, as their numbers have dwindled over the last few years. Tova is facing being alone in her old age, with no children or husband to take care of her, and so she makes the rash decision to sell her beloved house and move into a retirement community. I don\u2019t want to give too many details about Tova\u2019s past and her losses, because I think it\u2019s better to discover those revelations for yourself. Let\u2019s just say that I felt Tova\u2019s pain and wanted nothing more than for her to be happy.And Van Pelt includes so many funny moments in her story that kept the tone light, despite some of the more heavy themes. There\u2019s an ongoing bit about Cameron\u2019s lost luggage that was hysterically funny, and Tova inherits a stray cat at one point, which was a delightful side plot. I also loved the story about the t-shirt that Tova uses to clean Ethan\u2019s kitchen\u2014you\u2019ll just have to read the book so you can experience the hilarity too!And of course, I can\u2019t forget the star of the story, Marcellus the octopus. As the days tick by\u2014each of his chapters starts with a marker (\u201cDay 1,299 of my captivity\u201d, etc)---the tension builds as Marcellus gets closer to his impending death (at least that\u2019s what he thinks). Marcellus understands human nature more than most humans, and I loved the way he wisely intuits each character\u2019s needs. Ultimately, this is a story about creatures\u2014both human and animal\u2014saving each other. The way Marcellus\u2019s story plays out was absolutely perfect\u2014heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time.This is a very special book, and I\u2019m so glad I was able to finally read it. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "Oh my...What can I say about this lovely story adequately enough that has not already been said? This book has been on my radar for almost 2 years. I finally broke down and bought it for myself for Christmas. What an amazing gift! Easily in my top 5 for a favorite book. I did not want it to end.SPOILER ALERT - Although I hoped there would be a satisfying, happy \"human\" conclusion, I dreaded the sadness I also feared was looming. My husband was so panicked over my crying, he assumed I was in pain (I was, but not physically).This was a perfectly crafted book. The characters are well thought out and developed. I felt as if I was reading about people I could know personally. Their relationships and emotions are so empathetic and understandable. The dialogue and conversations are realistic and meaningful. The plot is both touching and humorous, with a smidge of mystery thrown in.But it is in the shortest portions of the book where this novel really shines. The most important character, Marcellus, a highly intelligent giant Pacific octopus, keeps a mental journal of his hopes and observations of his humans during his waning life in captivity at the aquarium. As best he can, he is able to guide Tova and Cameron to find the love and companionship they both so deserve and crave.Marcellus sees us with such sensitivity and compassion. \u201cWhy can humans not use their millions of words to simply tell one another what they desire?\u201d\u201cSecrets are everywhere. Some humans are crammed full of them. How do they not explode? It seems to be a hallmark of the human species: abysmal communication skills.\u201d\u201cHumans\u2026 For the most part you are dull and blundering. But occasionally you can be remarkably bright creatures.\u201d Yes Marcellus, yes we can.",

The star of the show is the octopus, but the story is more about the people. The main character, Tova, I found incredibly irritating til the very end, but by then she had already irritated me so much it didn't make much difference. The writing is at its best when told from the octopus' point of view and it really makes the book. I loved the different points of view. There is a loose end as the mystery is never quite solved, but it really doesn't matter much by then.",

                "reviewText": "I started with skepticism,. An octopus as narrator? That\u2019s a Disney movie, but not a novel. After several chapters, I was hooked. The combination of touching characters, a sea scape that\u2019s uniquely the Pacific Northwest, and plot line that\u2019s suspenseful kept reading long past my midnight sleep time. A feel good book that we all need in such violent times. Commendations to Shelby Van Pelt . 20, I",

                "reviewText": "I really got into this book from the start. It's pretty cool how they've got an octopus as a main character, which is something you don't see every day. It adds something special to the story. Reading it was easy and smooth. All the characters, even the octopus, are well done and make you feel like you're part of their world. The book has its emotional moments and some parts really make you think. It's about getting along with all kinds of life, which is a nice touch. Overall, it's a good read, especially if you're into stories that are a bit different but still have a lot of heart. Worth checking out.",
