It is told in a past/present format. We ultimately follow the story of Marianne. She is one of the few Parisans that successfully opened up a restaurant during war time. Her motivation to do so was her own secret and that secret unfolds as the story goes on.The story telling was captivating and I didn\u2019t want to put this one down. I highly recommend this one if WWII historical fiction is your favorite.",

The story was about a restaurant in paris, but half the story was about this girl in a country town and in England. Then only in the last several chapters she changes her name and proceeds with the story. The subplot seemed longer than the main plot.",

Each dealt with their personal losses in different ways, but in the end each gained and shared their strength to strengthen others.She captured the history of the times in language, dress, food and cooking with limited wartime rations as well as the extravagances of the German troops during the occupation. But, in the end the Liberty- Loving French served their country with their skills, talents, and limited resources. Viva la France!A great story based on good research, great dialog, and character development as characters grew from childhood to adulthood, and finally old age. Their troubles fertilized their strength and their character as if they became their own vineyards and gardens. Their French roots grew deeper in their rocky soil as their commitment to The Resistance began to flower and to feed the future generations.",
