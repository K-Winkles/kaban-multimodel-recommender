                "reviewText": "As usual, Danielle Steel has written a wonderful book . The Ball At Versailles is light fun and a trip to the past (1958), when debutant balls and white gloves were always in the picture.The French decided to throw a unique debutant ball at Versailles. There would be 250 debutants introduced to society, among them would be 40 American debutants. No explanation was given as to how these debs were selected had to have been present at a ball in 1957 or 58 or will be in December 1958. Escorts would be provided as well as a tea with the US Ambassador the day before the ball. It was definitely an honor just to be selected.Amelia Alexander was invited. She had grown up with a single mother after her father died. Amelia was currently in school at NYU to become a lawyer. She was happy to do this if it made her mother happy.Felicity Smith was the second daughter of a wealthy Texan. Her mother was a socialite. Her older sister constantly insulted and picked on Felicity as Felicity was overweight and brilliant. Felicity had endured the humiliation of a debutant ball in Dallas and had been promised by her mother that she didn't ever have to do anything like that again. Felicity really wanted to spend her free time at MIT to study instead of going to France. However, she knew that this would make her Father proud of her, so she gave in reluctantly. She did offer to let her sister go in her place; but she was not eligible. But, as family of the debutant, her family could attend. Would that satisfy her mother and sister?Caroline Taylor was the daughter of Hollywood legends. However, they were gone most of the time filming somewhere. Caroline saw this as an opportunity to spend a little time with her parents and a good opportunity for herself to make contacts for future transactions. She was currently in school in California studying filmmaking. She was also madly in love with an actor, Adam., and spent more time with him than in studying or attending classes. However, just before she left for the ball, he cruely broke up with her and immediately started seeing someone else. She was devastated and then she found out she was on probation due to her grades. Now she wished she wasn't going to the ball; but it was too late to back out.Samantha Walker was an art history major at NYU. Her mother and brother were killed in a traffic accident when Sam was five and Sam spent three months in a coma. She was left with occasional balance problems and a slight limp. Brought up by an overprotective father, she overcame most of her physical problems. She was excited to be invited but hesitated due to her problems; but her father helped her decide to go.Four girls from very different backgrounds were among the 250 debutants. Some how they managed to get together at the tea given by the US Ambassador. The four teamed up to get through the ball and became good friends who kept in touch after they returned home. The ball at Versailles changed the lives of these four young ladies in only three days. How were t",

                "reviewText": "I have been a Danielle Steel fan since high school and have read all her books. That said, as I have matured in my reading tastes (and as she has seemed to crank out books faster and faster) these have become a sort of \"palate cleanser\" light read for me between much heavier and more complex books. The books can be counted on as an escape and a fairly predictable happy resolution, often with travel, beautiful clothes and an upscale lifestyle thrown in. The last few books I have purchased I have been disappointed with, as the characters and plot have been extremely poorly developed with almost no depth at all and it has felt like they were not well edited or edited at all. This book was a nice suprise from the last few. While still a light read, the characters and plot were more developed and interesting than recent books. The girls at the heart of the story and their families draw you in and the plot was a little bit less predictable and you really ended up rooting for these young women. I feel that often the synopsis of these books gives away almost all of the plot, so I am not going to go into lots of detail that is already included in the book's description in this case. If you are a Danielle Steel fan, you will enjoy this book, probably more than her last few.",

                "reviewText": "Another win for Danielle steel! I feel like some of her books are exactly the same but this one stood out and made me fall in love with her writing all over again. Granny Dan, Zoya and HRH are some of my favorite books by her but this one rates right along with them.This love story is about friendship and true love. You get lost in the storyline and can imagine everything the four girls are going through. I give it a four out of five because I feel like there could have been a little more detail . I feel like Caroline's storyline kind of dies out And they don't detail much that happens to her after they come back from France.",

As always, it ended too soon, and I was taken out of the wonderful story and dropped back into the real world much too soon.",
