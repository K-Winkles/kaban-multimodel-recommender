So close to failure so many times but always seemed to come through as manifested in the end. A top read in my history collection!",

                "reviewText": "I have read quite a few books on the American Revolution, most non-fiction. This is a fictionalized/dramatized account of the personal life of Nathanael Greene mixed in with historical facts. I enjoyed the historical facts relating to the war, but I found the author's \"romance novel\" treatment of his personal life tedious. An editor should have caught the author's overuse of the phrase \"his lambent blue eyes\" (3 times by page 26, 13 times in total) along with the author's fixation on the phases of the moon (waning crescent, waxing crescent, waning gibbous, waxing gibbous, not to mention uses of full, and new). A red pen would have done the world of good in the review of a draft. What I did gain from this book is a great respect for Nathanael Greene's personal sacrifice for the Patriot's cause. The poor man does not receive anywhere near the respect he deserves. The author did an excellent job in conveying what our country owes to Nathanael Greene. But please get an editor that knows what they're doing.",

It's not only a great story of the mostly forgotten Nathanael Greene (and many more) and his mostly unknown wife Caty, but is also great about the birth of the greatest nation, America, with all it's labor/growing pains.Best of luck along with James Dumas' highly entertaining musical GREENE, AMERICAN REVOLUTION'S CATY AND MAJOR GENERAL NATHANAEL GREENE to educating the masses on Nathanael Greene and how the war was won with so little and vastly outnumbered. People should know that Cornwallis' army was \"ruined\" before they fled to Yorktown.",
