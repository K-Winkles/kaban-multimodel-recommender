                "reviewText": "Read for a bookclub. At first I thought, oh no, another boring book about a female in the 1700\u2019s who thinks marriage would be awful and it is so unfair that her younger brother is more important to the family and society simply because he is male. I felt like the author was throwing in some flowery prose between the same old, same old tiring thoughts or words of main character, Eliza, bemoaning her station in life. (Do authors repeat the same thing over and over because they think their readers are too stupid to remember they have already read it before, more than once?)But I\u2019m happy that the story picked up and Eliza\u2019s disdain was shown in action as well as her intelligence, her kindness, her industry, etc. The real, historical, Eliza, fortunately left letters and other writings so the author was able to craft her character with some depth. She defied some conventions but it was fun to see that she also enjoyed pretty dresses, fancy balls, letter writing, prayers, and friendships with other women.Natasha Boyd was able to write an interesting tale of history I had never heard of before; and without foul language or sex scenes. (Eliza does have an awakening physical attraction to men and musings about sexual relations.) However, a caution - this takes place in South Carolina in the 1700s and so includes slavery. There is implied violence and rape though not explicit descriptions.",

I will be purchasing more for some other family and friends in future.When there are true (slightly fictionalized) stories available for an author to tell us, and written so thoughtfully, most other historical novels pale in comparison. If there were more writers that would be willing to do the research and mine out real people\u2019s lives, today\u2019s society would be all the better for it. So often, people today generalize about women prior to the 1960\u2019s and the American South, so that heroines like the the Indigo Girl are either romanticized beyond recognition or all but forgotten.As a lifelong bookworm, except for classics, rarely do I read a book more than once. This one will go on my classic bookshelf.PS. Narration could not be better in the Audible version. Excellent!",

I was transported to another era and place through Natasha's writing and in awe of heroine Eliza Lucas's strength of character. Recommended read.",
