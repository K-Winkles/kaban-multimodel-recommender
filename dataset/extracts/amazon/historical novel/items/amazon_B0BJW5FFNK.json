And when special agent Sterling Bertrand is washed ashore at Evie's inn, her life is turned upside down. While Sterling's injuries keep him inn-bound for weeks, making him even more anxious about the man he's tracking, he becomes increasingly intrigued by Evie, who seems to be hiding secrets of her own.Decades earlier, in 1914, Englishman Remington Culbreth arrives at the Ocracoke Inn for the summer, but he doesn't count on falling in love with Louisa Adair, the innkeeper's daughter. When war breaks out in Europe, and their relationship is put in jeopardy, will their love survive?As Evie and Sterling work to track down an elusive German agent, they unravel mysteries that go back a generation. The ripples from the Great War are still rocking their lives, and it seems yesterday's tides may sweep them all into danger again today.Bestselling and award-winning author Roseanna M. White whisks you away to two periods fraught with peril in this sweeping and romantic dual-time tale. Read more",

If we want to make a difference-well, we do it by defying the norms, don't we?\"I've always enjoyed this author's work and Yesterday's Tides was no exception. It goes back and forth between two periods in history and the perspective of Louisa and Evie. It was very interesting getting the perspectives of women in the same family and same place during both WWI and WWII. Roseanna tackled some controversial topics with diplomacy. There was so much family drama and romance, and history while also dealing with a mystery. Some of the characters were absolutely horrible, though very well written. I loved the descriptions of Ocracoke Island. It just sounded like an ideal place to live, when it's not surrounded by German u-boats anyway. It had a very big surprise twist that absolutely shocked me. Really, I enjoyed every moment of reading this novel.",

I think this is my new favorite of her books. I\u2019ve read almost every series of hers and I don\u2019t want to give anything away, but White is so, so good at tying in past (and future) characters from her other novels into the current one. It\u2019s the best. It\u2019s like visiting old friends. This an incredible work of historical romance fiction.Also, thank you Roseanna, for writing so sweetly of Ocracoke and the Outer Banks. I was born and raised there and I think you did a great job representing it.",

But no matter how close people can be, there are the secrets one can hold so closely, they bring mystery yet by prayer and trusting faith God makes all things work together for good.",
