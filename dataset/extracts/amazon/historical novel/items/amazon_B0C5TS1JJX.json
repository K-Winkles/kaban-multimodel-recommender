            "Editorial Reviews Review The Last Man seizes the reader on page one and doesn't let go. Goodman has deftly brought his characters to life.... Smooth, engrossing, entertaining reading, from start to finish.\" (Lone Star Literary Life) \"Goodman writes crisp, confident prose, giving us a novel as compelling as the incredible true story it's based on. The Last Man blends thrilling, cinematic set pieces with convincing character work that explores the nature of crime and rehabilitation. Fans of historical fiction should list Goodman among their 'must-buy' authors.\" (James Wade, two-time Spur Award-winning author of Beasts of the Earth) \"Goodman's debut novel is a remarkable accomplishment. Through gripping action scenes and slow-burn character studies, Goodman delivers an authentic Texas story that will keep readers turning the pages. At its core, though, The Last Man is more than the tale of a botched heist. It is a haunting exploration of man's inherent brokenness and the longing for redemption and liberation.\" (Eileen Flynn, Austin American-Statesman staff writer and editor 2007-2020, and University of Texas adjunct journalism professor 2007-2019) \"If you're from Texas and a history buff, you may have heard about the Santa Claus Bank Robbery, but I guarantee you haven't heard the story told like this. Goodman mixes fact and fiction in an irresistible blend of storytelling and action that will have you turning pages until the very end. Do not miss this fabulous Texas tale!\" (Kathleen Y'Barbo, Publishers Weekly bestselling author of The Black Midnight and the Bayou Nouvelle series) \"Goodman's research and meticulous attention to detail places the reader at the scene of the robbery and the aftermath, including the court proceedings, jail, and prison life. Most important, though, is the saving transformation of 'the last man'\u2014a success story that all correctional professionals like me hope for, strive for, pray for, and love to see.\" (David Stacks - Director of the Texas Prison Museum and Retired Warden of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice) About the Author Thomas Goodman first ran across the story of the Santa Claus Bank Robbery when he lived in the small Texas county where it all took place. He currently lives in Austin, where he has been able to conduct extensive research on the true crime at the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. The Last Man is his first novel."

I was unfamiliar with the events of the great Santa bank robbery, so as I read the book I did some research on the side. The author does a great job of storytelling, and is historically accurate in the tale. He does a great job in making the reader care about rather unsavory characters. I found myself at the end cheering and hoping for Bobby\u2019s redemption. There is also a good afterword in which the author discusses what is fact, fiction, and supposition.I think this book is a fascinating story of a true incident in a small Texas town. Great read!",

The characters were very clearly introduced to the reader at the beginning. The story was so engaging, that when I was tempted to put it away and come back later, I found myself turning the pages to see what happens next. Thomas Goodman does a great job of keeping the reader in suspense until very late in the book regarding the identity of the last man. I found myself eventually rooting for one character. Even such a tragic story has what I consider a happy ending.",

One really identifies with the characters as they experience early 20th century rural Texas, its judicial process and prison system. The transformation and eventual pardon of Bobby Hill in the book are an encouragement to all that bad can be redeemed.",
