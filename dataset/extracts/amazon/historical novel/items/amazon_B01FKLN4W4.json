        "description": "Winner of the UK's Richard & Judy Search for a Bestseller Competition, this pause-resistant debut novel follows an orphan whose late, beloved best friend bequeaths her a treasure hunt that leads her all over Victorian England and finally to the one secret her friend never shared. It is 1831 when eight-year-old Aurelia Vennaway finds a naked baby girl abandoned in the snow on the grounds of her aristocratic family's magnificent mansion. Her parents are horrified that she has brought a bastard foundling into the house, but Aurelia convinces them to keep the baby, whom she names Amy Snow. Amy is brought up as a second-class citizen, despised by the Vennaways, but she and Aurelia are as close as sisters. When Aurelia dies at the age of 23, she leaves Amy 10 pounds, and the Vennaways immediately banish Amy from their home. But Aurelia left her much more. Amy soon receives a packet that contains a rich inheritance and a letter from Aurelia revealing she had kept secrets from Amy, secrets that she wants Amy to know. From the grave she sends Amy on a treasure hunt from one end of England to the other - a treasure hunt that only Amy can follow. Ultimately, a life-changing discovery awaits...if only Amy can unlock the secret. In the end Amy escapes the Vennaways, finds true love, and learns her dearest friend's secret - a secret that she will protect for the rest of her life. An abandoned baby, a treasure hunt, a secret. As Amy sets forth on her quest, listeners will be swept away by this engrossing gem of a novel - the wonderful debut by newcomer Tracy Rees. Read more",

Aurelia is quite the free-spirit for her era and travels quite a bit. However, in her most recent travels, Amy must stay home. Aurelia has been told she has a condition that will end her life soon. Amy is grief-stricken and after Aurelia's death is forced from the only home she knows. However, Amy discovers that she is not alone and her travels are planned by Aurelia even after her death. Following the adventures of Amy and seeing how she solved riddles left by Aurelia is a page-turner. Good read!",

                "reviewText": "If you can get past the fact that the \"treasure hunt\" could have been much simpler, less melodramatic, and then resist wondering about all of the ways the whole thing might not have worked as planned, then this book is a wonderful read. I was able to do this. I enjoyed the story and the way it was told. One mystery was easy to figure out eventually; the other one involving Amy's history not so much, and was a little unsatisfactory. In fact if it had turned out as I assumed, then Amy's background could have been much more believable. I thought Quentin Garland's story was wrapped up a little too quickly and suddenly though, as if the author tired of the character and didn't know what to do with him. I still think the book is worth five stars. I look forward to reading more of the author's work.",

It is easy to love and become immersed in. The tale of Amy Snow is a fascinating one. She overcomes a Dickensian childhood replete with neglect and abuse. Amy is always made to feel lesser by almost everyone. The shining exception is her friend and benefactor, Aurelia Vennaway. Aurelia's death sends Amy Snow (who's never been further than the nearest village) on a treasure hunt by train, coach, and carriage. Along the way, Amy Snow learns a vast amount about herself and about Aurelia. Amy discovers friendship, love, and joy. She revisits fear, foreboding, and betrayal.",

                "reviewText": "Nonostante la trama ,forse scontata, della ragazza povera che si impone in societ\u00e0 e trova l'amore, il romanzo tiene l'interesse con trovate nuove come la caccia al tesoro per scoprire la verit\u00e0 sulla protagonista e descrive in modo abbastanza dettagliato la vita e la societ\u00e0 del periodo vittoriano. Lo consiglio a tutti coloro che amano questo periodo e a coloro che amano leggere per rilassarsi e sognare.",
