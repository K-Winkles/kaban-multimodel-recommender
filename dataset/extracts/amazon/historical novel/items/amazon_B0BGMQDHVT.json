        "description": "\u201cWe have to wear the yellow star! It\u2019s the rules!\u201d the little girl sobs. But her mother presses a desperate finger to her mouth. \u201cDarling, today is different. We are going to leave our stars behind and go on a long journey. We must be very, very quiet, and pray nobody finds us until we are safe in England\u2026\u201dCornwall, England, 1943. When her husband is killed fighting in the Navy, grief-stricken Gwenna Devoran tries to fill the void in her life by offering shelter to two Jewish refugees in her farmhouse high on the Cornish cliffs. But at the train station, ten-year-old Lotti is waiting all alone in her neat red coat.Lotti\u2019s mother died protecting her on the journey. Now Gwenna is all this little girl has. Traumatised Lotti won\u2019t speak a word: and when an order comes for German prisoners-of-war to work the farm she\u2019s in more danger than ever. What will happen if the Germans find out Lotti is Jewish?When Gwenna overhears Lotti chattering happily to German captain Max Reiner, showing him her teddy bear, her heart stops. Shocked to hear Lotti finally speak, Gwenna is terrified for the little girl she\u2019s grown to love. But perhaps she can she trust the kindness in this German officer\u2019s gentle voice and bright blue eyes\u2026As Lotti heals a little more each day, Gwenna risks everything to spend more time with Max, certain he doesn\u2019t believe in the Nazi cause. But then a rumour starts in the village: Max himself fired the torpedo that killed Gwenna\u2019s husband.Devastated, Gwenna\u2019s heart is torn between loyalty to her country, the memory of her husband, and love for the little girl she secretly hopes could become her own. With Max desperate to prove his innocence, does she dare to trust him? And should she fight for the three of them to become a family \u2013 or will the war tear them all apart?An absolutely heartbreaking, gripping and beautiful story about how love shines brightly even in the darkest times, and the incredible sacrifices people make in wartime.

                "reviewText": "I was really looking forward to this. Would Natalie Meg Evans do as well with a book set in the English countryside as she has with those set in more exotic France and Italy? Well, she has. This book is well plotted, page turning, thought-provoking and relevant in today's world. And, after reading several of NME's books, I realised what I find so captivating about her writing. Intelligence, strong women, and historical accuracy all play a part, but what really grabs me and is special, is the assurance she has over elements of her story. As a reader, you KNOW, from the unassuming way that detail is disclosed, that the protagonist can make a hat (Milliner's Secret), or cut a pattern (Dress thief). Reading this book, I had total confidence that the characters knew how to plough a field, understood relationships between horses, and could bake a cake when sugar was impossible to buy. The effect of this is to create trust in the whole of the story, so that we have a strong relationship with the characters and identify with them and the experiences they have that are relevant to our lives today (PTSD, integrity, bringing up children, sexual identity, nationalism, food security.. ). As I said, thought-provoking. Or, simply a good story, well- told.",
