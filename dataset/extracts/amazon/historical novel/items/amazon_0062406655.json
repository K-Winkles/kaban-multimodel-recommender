                "reviewText": "I have been a long time fan of Mitch Albom and for me, this was his best book yet. It's a story of family and love, truth and lies, redemption and forgiveness. It's a World War II story but unlike any other stories that I've read about this time in history. The story is centered around three main characters in Greece before, during and after the war:-Nico is eleven years old and has never told a lie. He always told the truth no matter what the consequences.-Frannie is a schoolmate of Nico's and loves him from a young age.-Sebastian is Nico's older brother and resents him because everyone favors him plus he is in love with Frannie.When the Germans invade Greece, all of Nico's family is put on trains to what they are told are work camps. Nico had been out all day and when he returns to find his family gone, he is confronted by a German officer who tells him that he can save his family if he agrees to go to the train station and tell the Jewish people that they are being sent to a place with jobs and new homes. He agrees to this plan knowing that it will help to save his family. However, it's all a ruse and the German officer is using Nico's reputation as someone who doesn't tell lies to trick the Jewish passengers who are being sent to concentration camps. Nico doesn't learn the truth until after all of the Jewish people have been sent to Auschwitz. After that he vows to never tell the truth again. He then attempts to get to Auschwitz with a plan to save his family. The author goes into vivid details over daily life in the camp and the effects on Sebastian and his family. The book follows the lives of the three main characters during and after the war. I don't want to go into much detail about their lives after the war because I don't want to give any spoilers but I will say that even through the war is finished, all three characters are dramatically affected by their memories of life in Greece before the war and the cruelty that were inflicted on them and their families during the war.The narrator of the story is TRUTH and it's a story about the power of love to ultimately redeem us, no matter how deeply we blame ourselves for our mistakes.This book is a must read for anyone who reads WWII fiction for the way it looks at truth and the consequences of lies.",

                "reviewText": "Mitch Albom wrote a story that taught me a history lesson, what love can conquer and how hatred destroys.The characters are so powerful you feel as you are a witness to the horrors of humankind and the horrible deeds they do to destroy mankind.The story takes the lives of 2 brothers living Greece. They are Sebastian and Nico. Fannie is a friend to both brothers. But it's Sabastian who loves her but doesn't know how to tell her. Fannie is in love with Nico but shy to show her feelings. War is about yo turn their lives into a nightmare as the Germans invade their once quiet community. Udo Graf is the face of hatred the face of evilThe story takes you to the horror of Auschwitz, the destruction and inhumanity the Jewish people suffered.The characters are followed after the war and how these 4 lives all come together in only a scenario Albom could come up with.It is an amazing powerful story that both young and old need to read. For never should the history of this horror of war be forgotten. For it happened and to forget it is to forever hide the Truth.Thank you Mitch Albom for letting us remember and to see hate love and truth never fades away.",

                "reviewText": "Truth be told, Mitch Albom is an artist, not just an author. He is a craftsman with words. He shapes words and feelings like no other. With the words on his pages, he tugs on the emotions of the reader until they coalesce with his characters.That Mitch Albom has published this novel in 2023, at a time when the world is going crazy, and antisemitism seems to be gaining a stronger foothold even in the US is fortuitous. He has written a deeply touching account about the experiences of four individuals during and after the holocaust. It is a troubling, yet beautiful account that I believe will impact each reader and disturb them greatly. It is not a fanciful read. In writing this book, Mr. Albom has certainly fulfilled the admonition to his character \"to tell the world what happened here.\"",

                "reviewText": "I very seldom read fiction and even less so do I even finish a book of fiction. However, I did finish \"The Little Liar\" and found it to be okay. Author Mitch Albom has his book featured around four main characters who he takes from the time three of them are children, two boys and one girl, while the fourth one is an adult member of Hitler's Third Reich. The book jumps from one character to another with \"the little liar\" being a boy named Nico who is noted for telling the truth but is told individuals being carried a train are being brought elsewhere to work and have a new life when they are actually being brought to their death in a concentration camp. Does this sound familiar today with bus loads or airplanes carrying immigrants elsewhere to work?I feel author Mitch Albom is attempting to teach the reader lessons about life such as honesty and love as the book moves along. Nico expresses his appreciation of having experienced love for Fannie even if it was just for a little while.As an inexperienced reader of fiction I don't claim to have understood the full meaning of the book author Mitch Albom has tried to express but I did gain an appreciation of sorts as to what he is trying to teach the reader.",

Albom's style of writing his narrative keeps one engaged/pulled into its development from the beginning within the respective settings and circumstances, as it unfolds through the main characters in each part. I like how the story, as it leads the reader on a journey to its anticipated conclusion, is never predictable in what the final outcome would be in the how and the who done it until revealed at the very end. Like all of the other books written by Albom, this one did not disappoint!",
