                "reviewText": "This novel reminds me of the leather-bound Age of Explorers histories I used to read for term papers -\u2013 voyages to the African empire of Prester John, and so on. In \u201cThe Eagle and the Dragon,\u201d the author\u2019s conceit is that descendants of Roman soldiers captured by Parthians after the 53 BC battle of Carrhae return to Rome 150 years later, accompanying an ambassador from the Chinese Emperor. A group of adventurous Romans \u2013 feisty Senator Aulus Galba, patrician tribune Gaius Lucullus, and his faithful centurion Antonius \u2013 embark on a voyage back to China, carrying gifts for Trajan\u2019s eastern counterpart and hoping to acquire precious trade goods. The story follows them on their sea voyage to China, a trip beset by pirates, unfriendly locals, and ambassador Ming\u2019s bad behavior toward his concubine Marcia, one of the Roman umpty-great-granddaughters. Murder at the Chinese court forces them to make a daring escape from prison and struggle across the breadth of Asia to return to Rome, pursued by the Emperor\u2019s forces and treacherous Parthians.It\u2019s a humdinger of a story, accompanied by mini-maps in every chapter or so that show the reader where our heroes are. Mr. McIntyre\u2019s awesome amount of research and/or prodigious imagination allow him to pack interesting detail into the escapades, such as a sketch of the imperial palace and a description of dining with friendly Xiongnu nomads. I wish he\u2019d resisted the impulse to make Antonius sound like Alfred Doolittle (\u201cNot enough room ter turn around without hitting yer messmate though\u2026 beggin\u2019 yer pardon, sir\u201d), but maybe that won\u2019t bother other readers. A worthy addition to the Age of Fictitious Explorers bookshelf.",

                "reviewText": "I recently finished the Cato and Macro series of books by Simon Scarrow, set during the time of Emperor Claudius, and I was eager to read more about the historical Roman empire. I was hoping to find something a little less 'military,' so I put \u201cRome historical novel\u201d into the Amazon search box. The Eagle and the Dragon came up.Its premise looked interesting\u2014descendants of a lost Roman legion return to Rome from China, and get sent back by Emperor Trajan to establish diplomatic and trading ties with the Han Empire. The \u2018look inside\u2019 portion of the book drew me right in, right away. So I bought it. I couldn\u2019t have made a better purchase.This is the kind of deeply immersive read I\u2019ve been searching for for ages. I would describe this book as \u2018rich.\u2019 It\u2019s rich with characters whom I became very fond of (even the ones I hated \u2026there are a couple of nasty but totally believable baddies in this book!) The lush and varied settings are enriched by thoroughly-researched detail that underpins the characters and action, but never overwhelms the story.Mr McIntyre is a master storyteller. He knows exactly how to drip-feed information to the reader without showing off his scholarship. His many characters and different settings are all introduced in small increments and developed carefully, so they stick. He is an expert at creating nuanced characters who become real people to us, very quickly. He is a man who can write believable female characters as well as the majority of the male characters this tale demands. He understands politics and diplomacy, and how differing personalities make these situations work\u2014or can screw them up. And he serves up a cracking plot, which keeps pages turning and suspense building.The scope of the story is huge. The journey from Rome to China via the sea route, and a return trip from China to Rome via the Silk Road is a classic journey that even today would take a long time to make. Back then, it took several years, and was anything but safe and secure.On the way our main characters suffer physical and mental hardships, experience threats to their lives and livelihoods, see and learn about many different cultures while \u2018life happens\u2019 to them along the way. Relationships and friendships are formed\u2014some unlikely\u2014and some are eventually broken. Trust gets repaid, and trust also gets betrayed. Some characters live, some characters die during the journey. Most of these people develop new skills and acquire confidence in themselves. Some get their faiths tested many times. Things they believed at the outset of the journey are not necessarily what the survivors believe at the end of it.And, as an added bonus, much of Mr McIntyre's storytelling is accomplished with humour. Most of his characters\u2014both main and secondary\u2014have a sense of humour, according to their various personalities, and this makes the story sparkle. Mr McIntyre\u2019s dialogue is always lively, can be droll, and is always a joy to read.I fell in love with this highly original book, and found it hard to put down. I intend to read it again. I guess I can\u2019t give it a higher personal compliment that that.I look forward to many more books from Mr McIntyre.",
