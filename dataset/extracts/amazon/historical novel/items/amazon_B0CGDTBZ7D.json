It appears they were just as brutal as the Germans . Like it was killing season on humans. It just always makes me wonder how humans can treat others in such ways. If you like WWII historical novels I would recommend this one.",

                "reviewText": "\"Escaping Budapest\" is not just a historical account; it's a tribute to the indomitable human will to survive against all odds. It highlights the sacrifices made by individuals and families during times of war and the enduring hope that sustains them. This gripping tale, based on true events, is a stark reminder of the capacity for both good and evil that resides within us all. As I read this novel, I was reminded of the importance of bearing witness to the stories of those who lived through such tumultuous times. \"Escaping Budapest\" is a powerful and evocative narrative that left a lasting impact on me, prompting reflection on the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring need for compassion in our world. What truly sets this novel apart is its exploration of the complexities of human kindness and cruelty. Amidst the darkness, there are glimpses of compassion, like the Christian neighbor's initial act of kindness that saves lives. However, this kindness is contrasted with the sadistic cruelty of those who see a warped vision of purity in Hungary.",

The jumping between time and place told more of the feelings as it was a time that was jumbled up. No one could be certain of anything. Most of this family stayed alive through cunning,fight, observation of surroundings. Also love from a total stranger helped a bunch.",
