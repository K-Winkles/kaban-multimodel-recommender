I especially LOVE the way Madeline's telling her story to her and Jack's newborn son. (Though his name wasn't mentioned at all,after his birth) which gives him the privacy his mother craved for since meeting Mr J.J.Astor Madeline's 1 true LOVE until you were born. Of course sweet child. \ud83d\udc9d",

An inside look at the opulent lifestyle of the wealthy society of the early 20th century. What moves this story is the love and devotion the Astors had for each other in spite of their age differences. Told from the pov of Madeleine, the reader is naturally pulled into her narrative. It was a welcome read for the new year.",

                "reviewText": "Although the story sounded like one I could enjoy, it did not hit the mark. It is about a 17 year old girl who marries a man almost 30 years her senior. You have to question why a man close to 50 years of age would marry a teenager, other than the obvious physical angle. A man of his stature in the early 1900's required a wife who could represent him socially as well as support him emotionally, not exactly something a teenage girl would be experienced or qualified to do.John Jacob Astor was one of the wealthiest men in the world at the time of his death on the Titanic. His 5-month pregnant child-bride survived. Outside of being a passenger on the ill-fated journey and that she married into fabulous wealth and luxury, her life was not very interesting. Madeleine and Colonel Astor were together for only a short time, and thus this fictionalized story of her life had little to offer. The author did not show that Madeleine accomplished much of anything, certainly nothing or not enough to base an entire book on.If you are looking for a book about the Titanic, there are enough choices out there to satisfy any interest in the tragedy and the people involved, both real and fictionalized. Do not consider this book if you are making the purchase to learn about the Titanic - or if you are looking to read about an interesting person, for that matter, a person who has accomplished something, anything actually. You will be disappointed.I googled Madeleine Astor after I finished the book, and much of the information Ms. Abe' included was easily and quickly found. So I'm not sure just how much research was required on her part when trying to write about Madeleine. It couldn't have been easy coming up with a story about a person that young who hadn't done much or accomplished much outside of being the wife of one of the wealthiest men in the world and only for a very short period of time. I question why Ms. Abe' chose Madeleine to be the focus of an entire book. Surely the choices the author had were endless. A better subject could have been... almost anybody!Would not recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it\u2019s beautifully written and well researched. Until I downloaded the book I knew very little about the Astor family but reading this it has made me want to know more about them, particularly Madeleine (nee Force) and John Jacob Astor.The story begins with Madeline, a young widow telling her newly born son about his father who he will never know. It then continues to alternate between Madeleine\u2019s teenage years when she first saw John and telling the story to her son also John Jacob. So it continues, they marry and enjoy an idyllic honeymoon but this ends in tragedy. Their relationship was frowned upon by certain people because of their age difference, Madeleine was 18 when they married, John in his 50\u2019s and they were the subject of the gossip columns but they were obviously very much in love and probably would have gone on to have more children.",
