                "reviewText": "Octavia Butler's Kindred is one of a handful of \"must-read\" books. The story - of a young woman in 1976 California who is inexplicably transported back in time to 19th century Maryland to (repeatedly) save the life of her distant ancestor - is a powerful commentary on race, how the institution of slavery has impacted America in the present, and asks readers to consider hard, uncomfortable questions about who we as a nation are, who we want to be, and how should we remember and consider the past. I am overjoyed that this work is finally a graphic novel.As with any story that is translated into another medium, there are gems and important plot points that are lost. Among those in _Kindred_ is the inter-racial nature of the protagonist's marriage, and many of the details of how each experiences the 19th century given their race. Sometimes these omissions and editorial decisions get in the way of the story or its impact. In the case of the graphic novel adaptation, there is still plenty of gut-wrenching material and thought-provoking issues raised that the spirit of the story remains true to what Butler wrote.Jenning's artwork cleverly brings Duffy's adaptation to life - the variations of color and shading as well as the illustrations of the characters themselves don't distract from the story, and in many respects add to it (particularly in \"The Fight\" and the Epilogue). For readers unfamiliar with Butler's work, I cannot recommend _Kindred_ highly enough. For fans of graphic novels (or those who prefer this medium to the source text), the themes, message and plot remain close to the book, with little interference (and some graphic assistance), making this a recommended read.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been meaning to read Octavia Butler\u2019s Kindred for years, so when I saw that it had just been adapted as a graphic novel I jumped at the opportunity to finally read it while continuing to feed my insatiable appetite for comics. Mind you, I\u2019m not trying to claim that reading this version should serve as a substitute for reading the novel itself. However I do think that illustrating Butler\u2019s story makes it all the more gut-wrenching. Kindred is the tale of a modern African-American woman\u2019s repeated experience of being suddenly transported from her home in 1970s California back to the antebellum South. It\u2019s a very powerful story of courageous survival, both that of Dana, a modern woman forced to adapt to life as a black person in the era of American slavery, as well as the people of the period, whose lives become intimately intertwined with Dana\u2019s. By following Dana through her repeated and increasingly long and dangerous visits to an antebellum plantation in Maryland we form an emotional connection with her that serves to help modern day humans better comprehend the myriad horrors of slavery as well as the strength of those who endured and overcame it. It\u2019s dark fantasy with a vital purpose and I wholeheartedly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "The art in the graphic novel is good for the most part (though they did insist on depicting every nude woman with impossibly perfect spherical breasts). That's the only reason it has three stars and not one. I've been forced into studying Butler for a college lit course and, while I found most of her work an exercise in exploring the depths of pure human misery, this really takes the cake. Dana is a modern black woman forced through some quirk of time travel to constantly go back into the past and relive the pre-Civil War days. She's put through horrific abuses as a black woman in the slavery-era South and for no real reason. She is forced to endure these terrible abuses and that's just the plot. That's it. The book isn't teaching us anything we don't already know. Slavery was bad, slave owners were bad people, the slavery-era south was a bad place for black people. This is stuff we're all taught in elementary school and the book has no other message than that. It has no commentary about the triumph of the human spirit or a lesson to teach about a dark period in history. Butler just really liked inflicting pointless misery on her characters, all of whom, coincidentally or not, bear a striking resemblance in appearance and personality to Butler herself. Reading her work just feels like reading the literary version of someone else's oppressive intrusive thoughts of self hatred and self doubt. If you don't have to read this, skip it and read something, anything, else.",
