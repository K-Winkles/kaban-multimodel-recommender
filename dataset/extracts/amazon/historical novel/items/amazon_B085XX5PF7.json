        "description": "A new duke and a woman with a secret in her past get a second chance at love in this delightful and charming Regency romance from the New York Times bestselling author of the Windham series.Robert Rothmere is hiding a past no duke should have endured, but he's not hiding it well enough. Sooner or later, his enemies will learn that he spent years locked away at a private asylum. To get their hands on his wealth, they'll try to send him right back to his worst nightmares. If Robert is to foil their schemes, he needs to marry a perfectly proper, blessedly boring, deadly dull duchess, immediately -- and he knows exactly which quietly delightful lady he'd love to entrust with that role.Lady Constance Wentworth has cultivated a reputation for utter forgettability. She never speaks out of turn (in public), never has a daring thought (that she admits aloud), and never comes close to courting scandal . . . as far as anybody knows. Her path crossed Robert's years ago, though, and she's never forgotten the extraordinary lengths he traveled to keep her safe when she hadn't a friend in the world. She longs to be his demure duchess . . . but little does he know that to marry her would be utter madness. Read more",

I thought what did her father do to her? He was an abusive drunk to all his children. And of course Robert had been horribly abused by his father and then at the \u201casylum\u201d where he was basically tortured for being epileptic. These two people grew to love each other because they understood each other\u2019s pain and as a result they both overcame their fear. But it was the sweetness and gentility shown to Constance by Robert that really made me love him too. And there is a scene where Constance sticks up for herself at a wedding breakfast that literally had me a blubbering idiot. I like a book that pulls my heartstrings, that makes me do enraptured by the relationship and characters that when the reach the top of the mountain it makes me cry to see their pain but cheer their victory. This is a lovely book. One of the best I have read in a long time... now about her brother Stephen... can not wait to see what he does for Miss Abbott...",

                "reviewText": "My rating for The Truth About Dukes, by Grace Burrowes: 4 stars.I have read a lot of Grace Burrowes books, and she is a talented writer. While this book, and the other books in this series are not quite as good as some of her earlier books -- they are still very good.The books in the Roques to Riches series should be read in order, beginning with My One and Only Duke, because each book builds on information that is revealed in the earlier books. The books would not be as enjoyable if the reader wasn't aware of earlier information that had been revealed.I liked this book a great deal, and absolutely adored the developing romance between Constance and Robert. Both of them had very sad pasts, when they were treated horribly by their fathers, so they had a lot in common. I absolutely love that Constance wasn't bothered at all by Robert's illness. In that time period, many people considered him to be mentally incompetent, but Constance never did.I was glad that Robert immediately tried to help Constance with her problem, even though he knew that his mental competence would probably be questioned. I also liked that they found a solution to both of their problems, and that their families supported/helped them do that.The romance between Constance and Robert was sweet -- their conversations were sometimes a bit funny and often endearing. I thought they were really good together. I won't give spoilers, but I also liked that they were able to best the people who were determined to ruin Robert.My only complaint about this book was that it seemed a bit unnecessarily wordy, and also a bit too long. Some of the detail of the plot could have been left out, and the story would not have suffered.My rating system is below.1 star -- Hated it, or did not finish. I usually only give this rating if some of the content is truly objectionable to me, like if one of the main characters does something really awful, and gets away with it.2 stars -- Didn't like it. This rating usually means that I thought the writing wasn't very good, the editing was terrible, I didn't like the characters, or it had other major flaws.3 stars -- I liked it, but had some minor issues with it. This rating means that there were minor editing issues, the story needed more character development, it was just too unrealistic, or had some other fairly minor issue. The majority of books I read get this rating \u2013 I do not consider it a bad rating.4 stars -- I liked it a lot. This is a high rating for me, and I rarely give a higher one.5 stars -- I loved it, and will probably read it again. Very few books are good enough to get this rating from me. The ones that do are usually classics.",

                "reviewText": "This is one of those books I wish I could give more stars to. I'm a huge fan of Ms. Burrowes, but this story was unique in such a wonderful way among historical romances.Robert Rothmere was put into an asylum as a boy by his father because of his epilepsy. Rescued years later by his brother, he is now the rightful and reclusive Duke of Rothhaven. His neighbor is Lady Constance Wentworth who he knows from his years in the asylum (no spoilers).Robert struggles to deal with an unfamiliar world, one where he could be shamed at any moment due to a seizure. Constance has her own issues and these two damaged people find solace and love with each other. It's lovely writing about two interesting characters, different in many ways from the typical Regency H/h, a book I thoroughly enjoyed.",

The Truth About Dukes is yet another example of the beautiful writing of this amazing author. Her prose is simply lyrical and her characters are people you would be delighted to know. By the same token, however, there is always more to her romances than meets the eye. There is always a touch of mystery, an unexpected twist, or an unusual occurrence that demands eventual explanation. Grace Burrowes has created yet another such novel, and it is delightful from start to finish.",

                "reviewText": "Grace Burrows is a brilliant writer, though no one needs my opinion on that.This series has been, and is engaging, heart stopping and mesmerizing in it\u2019s content and characters. This book impressively imparts grace through the love story of a wallflower portrait artist, searching for the daughter she adopted away years before, who loves a gentleman Duke afflicted with epilepsy.Though set in a time when the disease garnered \u2018demonic possession \u2018 as its diagnosis, the tenants that stigmatize the disease are graciously presented and normalized. I don\u2019t think I have cheered for a hero and heroine as much as I have for these two, who graciously hoped for the best but planned to accept the worst. That central story is set amongst quirky, scheming and loving family members, friends and villains. The book is full!Brilliant writing. I\u2019ll read the next book, and then probably come back to this one, just for it\u2019s wisdom and humor. Well done Ms. Burrowes.",
