        "description": "Inspired by Picasso\u2019s great masterpiece Guernica, New York Times bestselling author Karen Robards returns with a riveting story of love, intrigue, deception and bravery in the face of war\u2026On an April day in 1937, the sky opens and fire rains down upon the small Spanish town of Guernica. Seventeen-year-old Sibi and her family are caught up in the horror. Griff, an American military attach\u00e9, pulls Sibi from the wreckage, and it\u2019s only the first time he saves her life in a span of hours. When Germany claims no involvement in the attack, insisting the Spanish Republic was responsible, Griff guides Sibi to lie to Nazi officials. If she or her sisters reveal that they saw planes bearing swastikas, the gestapo will silence them\u2014by any means necessary. As war begins to rage across Europe, Sibi joins the underground resistance, secretly exchanging information with Griff. But as the scope of Germany\u2019s ambitions becomes clear, maintaining the facade of a Nazi sympathizer becomes ever more difficult. And as Sibi is drawn deeper into a web of secrets, she must find a way to outwit an enemy that threatens to decimate her family once and for all. Masterfully rendered and vividly capturing one of the most notorious episodes in history, The Girl from Guernica is an unforgettable testament to the bonds of family and the courage of women in wartime.

                "reviewText": "So many stories of the horror humans have endured because of delusional egotistical vicious murderers. Hitler, Mussolini, Hirohito the emperor of Japan brought the Earth into a war of indescribable horror. They themselves never stood at the frontlines of their militaries, but forced others to fight the battles. This story was told from a different perspective than Americans have ever been exposed to. I am grateful for this writer bringing attention to Spains perspective or the horror that was brought to them. Knowing that behind the German lines there were people who fought Hitler\u2019s soldiers as spy\u2019s was acknowledging not all German people were supporting Hitler. As a side Note: I had a friend who was brought up in Germany during the war, she told of the general population in Germany that little or nothing to eat. She told of going to the trash bins of Hitler\u2019s army looking for potato peelings, peelings from carrots, onions, brown cabbage leaves, turnip cores, even the gristle from meat that was being thrown away. As the years pass, it is the stories that people do not know about that can bring the horror of any war to life.",

The arc of the story is broad and covers many years, bringing us to a satisfying conclusion toward the end of the war. While there is a love story threaded through, it does not distract from the very real struggles of the protagonist and many who fought for democracy during WWII.",

                "reviewText": "The Spanish Civil War is best remembered as a preview of things to come during World War II. The Luftwaffe bombed the village of Guernica , killed 1700 people and destroyed centuries of cultural prosperity and ancient architecture in the mid-1930s. We know about Pearl Harbor, but few of us realize that the extensive damage and cultural upheaval caused by The Luftwaffe in Spain was of equal significance. The Nazi contribution to World- wide economic collapse and the death of social responsibility is not a current issue, and few alive today can describe the total lack of civilian security and happiness experienced by our parent's generation in Europe. The Girl from Guernica creates a vivid narrative of the extent and social consequences of Fascist absolutism before and during World War II in Spain and Germany. This is a riveting story and will appeal to the younger generation as much as to today's parents and grandparents.",
