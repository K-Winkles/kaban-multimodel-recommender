                "reviewText": "I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel by Kelsey James. I say that as The Woman in the Castello is not my typical genre that I read but picked it up mainly because of the evocative cover. Every time it popped up in my feed on social media or Amazon, it captured my eye - and I'm glad it did.I'm not one for rehashing a book's synopsis in a review, so will dive right in a give my thoughts on why I loved this novel. First and foremost, Kelsey brings the setting of a small Italian village and the castle in which the story takes place, to full life. She creates an atmosphere of Italy in the 1960s that entices and permeates throughout the story.The characters are very well realized, especially our heroine, Sylvia. I loved that she wasn't as strong and secure in herself as she thought she was. She might try to present as worldly and self-assured but we, the readers who are in her thoughts, know it's an act and she's truly vulnerable and insecure and untrusting. Not your typical heroine and I liked that and could relate.The story, itself, is interesting and kept me engaged and curious and I even played detective a bit trying to solve the central mystery. No spoilers here, of course but let's just say I did not see the ending coming!Well-done all around but what will stay with me is that haunting evocative atmosphere that has me wanting to book a trip to Italy! Not sure I'll be staying at a haunted castle anytime soon, though!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m giving this 5 stars because I cannot believe how good it was since it was the author\u2019s first book. I had some expectation that I would like it, but I didn\u2019t think I would love it because it is not the sort of book that I normally read. I used to be an avid reader, but then life got busy, husband, house, work, kids, so I don\u2019t get to read books as much as I used to. Now that I\u2019m somewhat of an empty nester (one child leaving for school, one just returned), I was able to spend quality time with this book. It was quite the page turner, I was eager to see what was going to happen next. Having a family connection to Italy, I just loved the setting and the descriptions of Italy and the native Italians. I throughly enjoyed this book and I look forward to the next one from this author.",

                "reviewText": "I loved the Italian setting of The Woman in the Castello. It\u2019s set in a crumbling castle on the edge of a volcanic lake that\u2019s rumored to be haunted. I liked the horror and giallo references and I personally could have done with more giallo elements in this story. The first half of the book was quite slow but things do ramp up in the second half. It was fairly obvious who the villain was but I was definitely surprised by some of the details of the mystery.But there were some things that didn\u2019t work for. For one, our protagonist drove me nuts. She was constantly whining and throwing out accusations at everyone. I also struggled with the prose of this book. The writing is rather stiff and the author was constantly telling us what was happening rather than showing. The characters are also incredibly flat and one-dimensional. There is a romance element which I think worked fine but it wasn\u2019t anything that exciting. Overall, this gothic story was entertaining at points but as a whole it was a bit of a let-down for me.",
