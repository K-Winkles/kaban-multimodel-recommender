A compelling story about the storyteller's literal and figurative journey in his formative years, I was forced to turn the pages and follow his path.We learn about Chase's personal struggle to accommodate a drastic lifestyle change from prosperous east coaster to living among the simple citizens of Beijing. We read of the challenging food choices, strange sleeping accommodations, difficult friendship formations and how he handles the grueling practices and complicated cultural nuances. We observe his team mates fight to survive in a tough, almost life or death struggle to remain on the team. Chase is challenged to the max as he tries like a warrior, and at the same time is compassionate and tender in his effort to understand his teammates, all in a world where he is both \"deaf and mute\" because the language is so extraordinarily difficult.I learned in many dimensions about a life experience in China and the tough psyche of its people. This book is a must read for anyone who loves a great old fashioned story which cannot be put down. J.R. Thornton truly has a great gift for storytelling and we hope there is lots more to come.",

                "reviewText": "Your rating of this book might depend on several things. Beautiful Country is about a 14 year-old boy with an incredible amount of skill at playing tennis who is having a difficult time coming to terms with the death of his brother. Subsequently, his father sends him to China to practice with the Chinese national team for a year. If you like tennis and know a lot about it, you will probably like Beautiful Country. Several times I thought J.R. Thornton added \"A Novel\" to the title to differentiate it from a textbook on Chinese history and culture. The story itself was excellent, but there were times when I wanted to shout \"enough already!\" during all the technical tennis terms and history pontifications. There were also lessons in the Chinese language, complete with the Chinese characters, as if we might be able to replicate them or recognize them again. Much Chinese was spoken with the English translation in parentheses. One minute I loved the book, the next I was sick of it. I guess if I absolutely had to say yay or nay to recommending this book, I would say yay. Just be aware of the trappings that come with it.",

Having traveled to China a number of times on business I found many of the \"insights\" offered by the narrator to be rather obvious, e.g. heavy pollution in Beijing. As an avid tennis player, I enjoyed the portions that revolved around the tennis training, but those also seemed fairly superficial and truncated. All in all, intriguing and lots of potential, but not quite what I would call engrossing.",

As the reader, you gain insight into these class differences through befriending Bowen (a junior tennis player who comes from a migrant family) and Mr. and Mrs. Zhang (his host family who have deep connections in the powerful government). This book is perfect for the person looking to revisit their time in China as well as the individual looking to transport themselves to a mysterious nation rife with contradictions.",

I think anyone who is interested in tennis, travel and learning about a young boy's inner feelings so far from home, would like this book! No swearing, no sex, just a good story.

As a high-school senior studying Mandarin, I appreciated and am impressed by the author's incredible ability to observe and synthesize the nuances of Chinese culture. For example, Thornton's paragraph about the importance of the seating arrangement at the dinner table is a topic which I just studied in my Chinese class this past year. On varsity tennis, I connected with Thornton's realistic drama, emotion, and even technical components of the game. Apart from these topics, \"Beautiful Country\" perfectly captures the complexity of growing up in today's world. I'm recommending J.R. Thornton's book to all of my friends!",

                "reviewText": "I listened to an interview with the author on NPR. The novel was about China and tennis. Two of my favorite topics. This novel is autobiographical and although the writing is good, not great, the story provides a look into China and its people that is well worth reading. I was in Beijing myself during the period that the story takes place. I was there only three weeks, and strictly a tourist but I recognized the authenticity of the writing. We in the western world know so little about China. Reading this book is an opportunity to change that.",

                "reviewText": "I thoroughly enjoyed this first novel by J.R. Thornton. His personal history and insight gave me a vision of contemporary Chinese life that I was not aware of nor prepared for.At the end of the book, I was surprised?, embarassed? or something like that to realize that it is not autobiographical but rather a novel. The author's actual age and timelines did not mesh but it took me the whole book to come to that conclusion.I found his page on internet (don't we all in the end?) and have enjoyed his short stories. I look forward to new writings by Mr. Thornton.Highy recommendable.",
