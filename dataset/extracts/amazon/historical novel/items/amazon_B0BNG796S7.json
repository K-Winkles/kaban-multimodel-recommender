Max Fischer cannot remember anything from his life before the concentration camp. Not his family, not his occupation, not even his own name. All he is left with is the sickening, maniacal laugh that echoes in his head. More than haunting his every waking moment, the laugh is Max\u2019s only connection to his lost past. For a holocaust survivor, recalling the past comes with a heavy toll.Just months after the allied forces liberated the camp that interned him, Max is introduced to the beautiful and wealthy Alexandra Brecholdt. The former Berlin actress seems adamant on taking Max into her care, but there is something she is too ashamed, or too afraid to tell him. The secret of her fortune, her survival\u2014and her son.As Max\u2019s memories begin to unravel, it becomes clear that the laugh is the key to his lost past. Restless, Max takes it upon himself to uncover its origins as Alexandra vows to protect him from the horrible truths it hides. Their mutual hunger for life shows them the true meaning of courage, love, and hope \u2013 and the ultimate secret behind the laugh. Read more",

It is the constant reminder for both the central character and the reader, of a presumably horrific event from the past, which is only manifested through internal laughter. I think the strong contrast creates an eerie atmosphere at times, and evokes feelings of fear due to its unusual nature. Furthermore, the plot is solid, it unfolds very nicely, the characters have great interactions in multiple ways, and of course you\u2019re always wondering what happens next.",

They changed their names at the time if marriage and somehow, in the confusion of the times got a way with it. Had the same happened to me as Max, I'd have wanted to do the very same to his torturer. Not to the child, they're innocent. But the bully boys and other assorted nazis, they deserve nothing but the same treatment meted out to our Jewish ancestors who did not escape the vile hitler.",
