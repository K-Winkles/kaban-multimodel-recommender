                "reviewText": "Once again Donna Everhart has written a novel that entertains and educates. This novel centers around Joetta McBride and her family in North Carolina before and during the Civil War. I have read many novels set during that period told from the perspective of a slave owner or slave. Donna has told her story from the perspective of a wife of a small farmer who owns no slaves. When talk of war begins, she feels the fight is not their fight, that only the rich landowner has anything to gain or lose from the war. She doesn't take 'sides' and neither does her husband, a view that serves to ostracize them. However, when her oldest son runs away to join the Confederate fight, she is drawn into a battle she never wanted.This author does such a fantastic job putting you into Joetta's 'skin' you will feel her pain and her disappointments and understand how this mother only wishes for her simple life of home, hearth and family to return.If you have never read a Donna Everhart novel, you are missing a writer who can take you into the hearts of her characters. And you don't forget them. Five stars all the way.",

Her bookscapture life in the South, as her characters endure hardships and adversities. Being a North Carolina native myself, I found her geographic relevance to my own location and travels within the state, with accuracy and detail. It's clear that a great deal of research has been spent in regards to the given historical time period and location. Both heartwarming and heartbreaking stories unfold in each book, making for eager anticipation with each page turn. I look forward to her next release.",

                "reviewText": "'One either believes in one's morals and convictions, or they do not'.For Joetta McBride life is good. Life is peaceful. Life couldn't be any better. As subsistence farmers, they work hard and reap their own bounty. She could not want for anything more - except for her curmudgeonly father-in-law's incessant talk with her sons over impending war with the North to cease. As far as Joetta and her husband are concerned, there is no need to take sides and become involved in a war. After all, there are no winners in war. However, when her eldest son disappears in the middle of the night, and her husband chases, desperate to find him, their family is suddenly forced into the fray. As distressing as this is, Joetta remains steadfast in her neutrality. But sitting on the fence is not something the community tolerates, and as one war is fought away from her home, Joetta's war has begun at her gate. 'The divide of the North and South was like a great crack in the earth, a gaping maw of distrust, and the self righteousness and determination that grew with each passing conflict only served to expand the difference'.I enjoyed reading Joetta's journey of self-discovery and grew to admire her determination in spite of all the adversity and hardship she faced. I also appreciated gaining an understanding of how the Civil War may have affected not only everyday life but also conflicted border states. I have not read anything from Donna Everhart before but she certainly has a way of slowly building stories, and developing characters, until you've become very vested in the outcome.Readers of historical fiction, particularly American history, and strong women characters will appreciate this book.",
