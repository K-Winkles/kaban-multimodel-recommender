                "reviewText": "Deborah Swift never disappoints and this newest book is another winner. As always, this author enlightened me about an aspect of World War II, the use of black propaganda by the British in the form of fake radio broadcasts. It was fascinating and quite a production, transmitted to Germany and run by the Political Warfare. The heroine, Lilli Bergen, is a German Jewish refugee in England and a woman of many talents. The villain, Brendan Murphy, her ex-boyfriend in Berlin is an IRA/Abwehr agent who shows up to work the radio broadcasts. The result is a pulse-pounding game of cat and mouse in a tautly written plot that kept me turning the pages faster and faster. I love how Deborah Swift writes historical characters and events into her story, intermingling them seamlessly with the fictional characters and plot.Fake news and the threat of fascism are back with us and parts of this book read eerily like today's headlines even though it was WW II. The following quote hit home for me: \"They have a loyalty to a warped dictator and will stop at nothing to see him succeed. It's not about what's really best for the people, it's about them. Them having the right to dictate what's best for all of us.\" This latest book is excellent and I hope there will be another in the series soon. My thanks to NetGalley for the complimentary ARC. All opinions and the review are entirely my own.",

                "reviewText": "If you've ever wanted to yell at a character, \"Don't snoop in that room! The villain is coming!\" I think you'll want to read \"The Shadow Network\" by Deborah Swift. Lilliana Bergen, a German college student, seeks refuge in England after her father is taken by the Brownshirts in 1939. Although Lilliana experienced some vary harrowing experiences, she eventually lands on her feet. A radio network that broadcasts false information to the Germans wants a singer. They've learned about Lilliana's singing talent and offer her the job.Thus begins her career in World War II's fake news industry. Lilliana also finds she's attracted to coworker Neil Callahan, who walks with a cane and is burdened by a dark secret. In addition, both have signed the Official Secrets Act and cannot speak about what their department actually does. Naturally secrets attract people-- dangerous people-- who want to know those secrets, especially during wartime.Deborah Swift has added an excellent set of resources at the end of the book. Even though Lilliana and Neil are not real, many of the events are.I recommend \"The Shadow Network\" and Swift's previous WWII book, \"The Silk Code\" if you like to read about WWII espionage. In addition, Swift has many other historical novels that cover a number of time periods. I've enjoyed all that I've read.Thank you to NetGalley for this advance release copy.",

                "reviewText": "The Shadow Network was a fun way to learn about what might have happened in WW2. There was enough truth within the story that I knew I would be digging deeper into the Shadow Network. I use historical fiction books to guide me in researching and this story is my new best friend.I use historical fiction to picture what it might have been like for my relatives in England during WW2. I use historical fiction to learn of some of the struggles. Stories like this one humanize the War.The Shadow Network is full of action and suspense. The story centers around a radio station that sends false information to Germany. Total brilliance. They used German POWs and enemy aliens to broadcast and entertain.When a spy works his way into the Shadow Network things get very interesting. There is a man he was supposed to kill. There is a woman he has a past with. He is an IRA member answering the Nazi sympathizers. The question is will he get caught and how?So many twists. So much unexpected. So many Oh Wow moments. All of this made for a very interesting",
