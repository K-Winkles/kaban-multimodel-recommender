        "description": "Now a New York Times best seller! From the author of Truths I Never Told You, Before I Let You Go, and the upcoming The Warsaw Orphan, Kelly Rimmer\u2019s powerful WWII novel follows a woman\u2019s urgent search for answers to a family mystery that uncovers truths about herself that she never expected. \"Kelly Rimmer has outdone herself. I thought that Before I Let You Go was one of the best novels I had ever read.... If you only have time to read one book this year The Things We Cannot Say should be that book. Keep tissues handy.\" (Fresh Fiction)\"Fans of The Nightingale and Lilac Girls will adore The Things We Cannot Say.\" (Pam Jenoff, New York Times best-selling author) In 1942, Europe remains in the relentless grip of war. Just beyond the tents of the Russian refugee camp she calls home, a young woman speaks her wedding vows. It\u2019s a decision that will alter her destiny...and it\u2019s a lie that will remain buried until the next century. Since she was nine years old, Alina Dziak knew she would marry her best friend, Tomasz. Now 15 and engaged, Alina is unconcerned by reports of Nazi soldiers at the Polish border, believing her neighbors that they pose no real threat, and dreams instead of the day Tomasz returns from college in Warsaw so they can be married. But little by little, injustice by brutal injustice, the Nazi occupation takes hold, and Alina\u2019s tiny rural village, its families, are divided by fear and hate. Then, as the fabric of their lives is slowly picked apart, Tomasz disappears. Where Alina used to measure time between visits from her beloved, now, she measures the spaces between hope and despair, waiting for word from Tomasz and avoiding the attentions of the soldiers who patrol her parents\u2019 farm. But for now, even deafening silence is preferable to grief. Slipping between Nazi-occupied Poland and the frenetic pace of modern life, Kelly Rimmer creates an emotional and finely wrought narrative. The Things We Cannot Say is an unshakable reminder of the devastation when truth is silenced...and how it can take a lifetime to find our voice before we learn to trust it. Don't miss Kelly Rimmer's new and unforgettable novel, The Warsaw Orphan. Read more",

Not sure about 1 last name but that could have multiple spellings I guess, although it appears misspelled too. Just a small area to be aware if this type of stuff bothers you.",

Alice becomes a voice box for Alina, her grandmother, after a tragic stroke. Through Alice, Alina is able to present her own historic account of her WWII experience in Poland. Alice is able to uncover deep family secrets that remained hidden for almost eighty years using crumbs of the past that her grandmother left behind through mysterious addresses, letters, and photos. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys having their heart broken, only to be put back together word by word throughout this story.P.S. - I initially listened to this story on Spotify, but I loved it so much that I had to by a physical copy for my own personal library.Favorite Quote:\u201cYou and I were made for each other\u2014so whether you come to be with me or I come home to be with you\u2014we will always find our way back to each other.\u201d",

And the incredible power of telling a story ! This book shed so much light on the resistance in Poland during World War II, especially how it looks like to live in the area just a stone's throw away from Auschwitz birkenau.What really struck me about this book was its powerful message of redemption and doing the right thing, even in the face of unimaginable cruelty and injustice. It's a timely reminder of how important it is to hold onto our humanity, no matter how bleak things may seem. And It also taught me not to judge what we see at first glance. Even when we think it\u2019s obviousI absolutely adored the story and the characters. And i loved how the author seamlessly weaved together two timelines , I was completely captivated from start to finish.",

                "reviewText": "After reading this book, one cannot help but compare the terrible invasion of Poland in 1939 with the senseless invasion taking place in Ukraine today. Perhaps that is why Poland is so ready to assist the refugees pouring into its country today, because the memory of what happened so long ago is still in everyone's mind.Why don't we learn from our past mistakes?Alina and Tomasz are childhood sweethearts. The night before he leaves for university in Warsaw, he proposes to her. But when her village of Trzebinia falls into Nazi hands, Alina doesn't know whether Tomasz is dead or alive.The story is told in two timelines, both equally compelling. It is 2019 when Alice's Polish grandmother suffers a stroke and has little time to live. Unable to speak, she desperately conveys the urge to seek out Tomasz in Poland. But Tomasz was Alice's grandfather, who died last year. Is Grandma suffering from a memory lapse or is she hiding a bigger secret?I absolutely loved this book. The characters were multi-layered and so imperfect that they seemed real. We follow Alice, who struggles with a young son with Asperger's Syndrome, a prodigy daughter and a work-addicted husband as she travels to Poland and begins to uncover a heartbreaking story that will touch her family in more ways than one. I braced myself for the ugly cry I knew was coming and I wasn't wrong. It made me feel so many emotions. \ud83d\ude22The writing style was exquisite and I loved how each chapter slowly brought us closer to the truth as I hoped Grandma \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e would hang on until Alice could give her the answer she had been waiting for.This is a poignant story of loss, sacrifice, unconditional love and family bonds. Can't recommend it enough.",
