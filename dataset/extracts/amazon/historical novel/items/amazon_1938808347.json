Characters feel like real & likable people, who are dynamic and relatable. Yet true to cultural norms of the historical setting. Good at setting the atmosphere and scenery of the training compound. Almost makes you feel like you are in the place of the main character, experiencing new surroundings and situations and adapting to them. Finally, has action and Nin- Jitsu skills Like those of us who enjoy shinobi stories Want, but the warm instead of cold feel a normal person would experience in the process of acquiring them, especially as a Kuno Ichi Being trained to be charming as well. The social dynamics of making new enemies and friends and the feel of joining a new school is mixed in too. I am anxiously awaiting the next novel in the series.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Intriguing YA historical fiction set in feudal Japan",
                "reviewText": "This book reminded me so much of Tamora Pierce's Tortall books, specifically the first Alanna or the first Kel book. Many of the plot-points are the same: a girl enters a new institution and spends all her time learning new skills, training, and passing tests. Only instead of a fictional fantasy world, Kudler's tale takes place during feudal Japan, during a time of civil war when different clans fought for political domination. Risuko's story takes place during the sixteenth century reign of Oda Nobunga.Risuko, along with Emi and Toumi, are picked up by Lady Chiyome and taken to Mochizuki where the girls become novices and begin training to be kunoichi. The characterization is simplistic, with the author falling back on generalizations in character rather than creating fully fleshed-out people. Toumi (along with junior initiates Mai and Shino) are mean girls. Emi is the quiet one. And Risuko is the headstrong willful one who is too curious and smart for her own good. Even the more dominant background characters seem bit one-dimensional in characterization. Kee Sun, for example, is one who gets a lot of space in the book, but other than being Korean, dedicated to food, and jolly with a bit of a temper, there's not much to glean from him. Hopefully, this is something that is rectified in the second book.There's also a whiff of \"chosen one\" to this story. Of course Risuko is a skilled climber, which becomes plot relevant many times. Of course Risuko is smart and clever.That all said, I did really enjoy this book. The plot moves a bit slowly, and other readers may get bored with the day-to-day life of Mochizuki (it does devolve at times with this happened, and then this, and the this). Others may enjoy it as it is nice worldbuilding and lets the reader learn what it was like in one of the centers that trained elite warriors. There is also enough hints of Risuko's larger purpose that I'm extremely intrigued where Kudler takes the character.Readers who already enjoy Tamora Pierce and similar authors would enjoy this. I'm looking forward to the second book.I received a free review copy from the publisher.",

The book begins with the view from a single tree and expands gradually outward, through the experiences and perspective of the young heroine. I found myself immersed in the world of the book, getting to know the characters and fascinated by the setting.Risuko is on something of a hero\u2019s journey; I\u2019d expect nothing less from an author who has so closely studied Joseph Campbell. She faces self-discovery, growth, and moral dilemmas in this book, and no doubt the ones to come. I look forward to following her journey in the series!",

And over this book and the next in the series, Brighteyes, the three girls - Risuko, Toumi and Emi - find out the secret of why they were taken, and what their purpose in life is to be.

                "reviewText": "Impossible not to like this book, especially for someone like me who lives in Japan. David Kudler slips in so many moments, words and sentiments that remind me why I love this country, and I feel sure will endear others to Japan.Kudler brings a small corner of the world of feudal Japan to life with what feels like effortless ease. The descriptions are never overwhelming nor tiresome, but swift to paint a scene and quick to capture the imagination. The book is short but you never feel like you haven't been introduced properly to the world. I definitely wanted more of the world and the story, and I assume this will happen in following books.The book is marketed as young adult but I think it has broad appeal. I'm definitely not a young adult! I tend to read a lot of dark fantasy so this was a refreshing change of pace. There are moments of violence and dark undertones, but the general mood is one of hope. It feels good to be with Risuko on her journey.Also, I have to compliment the presentation of the book. The cover is wonderfully Japanese, beautiful but simple.",
