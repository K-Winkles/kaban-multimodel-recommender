        "description": "The Pillars of the Earth tells the story of Philip, prior of Kingsbridge, a devout and resourceful monk driven to build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has known...of Tom, the mason who becomes his architect - a man divided in his soul...of the beautiful, elusive Lady Aliena, haunted by a secret shame...and of a struggle between good and evil that will turn church against state, and brother against brother. A spellbinding epic tale of ambition, anarchy, and absolute power set against the sprawling medieval canvas of 12th century England, this is Ken Follett's historical masterpiece. Read more",

                "reviewText": "I remember my mom reading this book and loving it. Then I remember the miniseries coming out, and I thought, \u201cOh! Ian McShane!\u201d I didn\u2019t watch it. Then I forgot about it for about a decade and a half.I saw it at my local library and checked it out in my usual attitude of \u201cOf course I\u2019m gonna read this and the other four books I checked out in the next 3 weeks!\u201d I had a little pocket money, so I ordered it on Amazon when the time came to return the library book and admit for the thousandth time that I don\u2019t have nearly as much time to read as I used to.Holy $#\u00a1\u00a5 am I glad I did.This book is tremendous. The detail, the readability, the huge time arc of the plot, and, most importantly , the characters.The characters drive the story. I know that\u2019s a cliche , but I don\u2019t care; the characters in this story are brilliant. Tom Builder, Prior Phillip, William Hamleigh, Aliena, Jack, Ellen, Martha, and more. Even the supporting characters are interesting and clearly have their own motivations, even if Follett swings between thumbnail sketch and staying mum about those motivations.I won\u2019t wax too much about this book. It would take too many words, and Pillars of the Earth is already full of them. 973 pages in the paperback edition to be precise. I know that most people aren\u2019t necessarily interested in a book that gives Lord of the Rings a run for its money in the length department, and I, as a fan of long books, am hardly unbiased. But it is worth it. You\u2019ll miss meals reading this thing.Two points I want to make:1) This book avoids (mostly) one of the major pitfalls of historical fiction. The people in the story seem like they are actually from the Middle Ages, rather than being moral and philosophical transplants from the modern age. This is the Achilles heel of writers like Bernard Cornwell (whom I\u2019ve read and enjoyed) and (I\u2019m told) Phillips Gregory. The story may be fun or compelling, the detail may be solid and accurate, but the characters don\u2019t seem like they are actually from the period. Scratch the surface, and they turn out to be a 20th/21st century citizen mentally, rather than a person from that \u201cforeign country\u201d called the past.Follett doesn\u2019t do that. Or, at the very least, by the time he may have around page 600, I didn\u2019t care.2) A warning: dovetailing with point number 1, there are parts of this book that are VERY difficult to read. When it comes to fiction, I\u2019m a fan of sex and a fan of violence. But the unfortunate reality of the Middle Ages (and history and life in general) was that the two were often combined. Those of us that are lucky have never had to deal with this. But, even more so in innumerable areas of the past, this is a reality, and Follett does not shy away from it. One instance early in the book had me put it down and walk away. I came back, because, again, it is a spectacularly written and told story, but there are parts that will make your stomach turn. You have been warned.All told, this book is incredible. The building of the fictional Kingsbridge cathedral reflects the sheer amount of effort, ingenuity, and, most importantly, time it took to build these structures.Don\u2019t believe me? Look up Salisbury cathedral on an image search and ask yourself: \u201cHow, seriously HOW, was this built back then?\u201d This novel will tell you a story about that.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Do you like breasts? Well, Ken Follett does, and he is here to tell you about it.",
                "reviewText": "Young breasts, flat breasts, full breasts, ripe breasts, large breasts... they are all featured as main characters here. 17 year old boy character fixating on his crush's breasts? Understandable. But then both the male characters and Ken Follet take every excuse to further fixate on breasts. There really are good facets to this book (more below), and when I was nearly done I thought, Well, at least I won't have to keep reading about breasts constantly. Then one of the last passages is an old man musing fondly on all the changes her breasts have undergone throughout the years. I nearly threw my Kindle out the window. This kind of book is where the \"she breasted breastily abreast the breastway\" quote comes from. The sex scenes are really excruciating.Okay, so other issues? Well, first off (this isn't a main issue but it irked me) is that Villain Woman has really bad skin. This is all anybody thinks about when they look at her. This is basically how she's described. I kept thinking, okay, we're in the Middle Ages and people are freaked out about a woman's acne? Because the Middle Ages were all about regular cleansing and moisturizing? Anyway, the cliche of bad people having bad skin is very lazy. The villains were lazily written too. The main one, William, just rapes and kills everyone and seems like he'd cheerfully skin a nun if given the chance. No complexity. Tom, one of the good guys, has no complexity either, unless you count him being a genius architect and a complete moron about everything else.So why four stars? Well, the historical research is incredible, especially considering it was written in 1982 before you could ask ChatGPT to tell you what happened. And the plot, despite all the frustrations of stock characters and rampant breasts, is really good. It's gripping and page-turning and you want to see what on earth is going to happen. The writing is okay. It's written like a thriller, which he also writes, and it's simple and straightforward. Some of the sentences struck me as poorly worded, but overall it's not a glaring issue.I should also note that I read his most recent Kingsbridge books and there are a lot fewer breasts. In a good way.",

Easily one of the best books I have ever read, the plot \u2013 someone really wants to build a cathedral in the Middle Ages\u2013 seems deceptively simple and dull. What is presented to the reader is historical fiction at its best. The book is close to perfection, I can\u2019t think of anything that I would criticise or wish to change, though a couple of trigger warnings might help for a few people \u2013 this is about life in the medieval times after all.The plot, the story, characters, political intrigue, love, betrayal, lust for power, it\u2019s all there, and it\u2019s all happening. A surprisingly fast read, which could still take a while to read, given it\u2019s over a thousand pages. And still leaves you wanting more.If you\u2019re apprehensive about starting a series, don\u2019t worry, this can easily be read as a standalone. The next book is set in a later time period, so you can stop here and get a complete story. And what a tale Ken Follett has written. A work of fiction with very real characters you will end up caring deeply for.",
