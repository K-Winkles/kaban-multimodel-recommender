                "reviewText": "Originally posted on my blog at https://rantandraveaboutbooks.com/2016/07/29/the-song-of-achilles-fate-fury-and-friendship-make-for-a-rave-review/First, I think it\u2019s important to mention that The Iliad is my favorite book, so my connection to the characters and this story is much deeper than most. I read The Iliad in 2001 and have since been obsessed with all things Greek mythology as well as anything related to the Trojan War. I\u2019ve read The Iliad a total of six times in its entirety, so when I read The Song of Achilles, a work of historical fiction based on the book, I was completely blow away. I can\u2019t remember the last time I stared at the last page of a novel and felt that satisfied.I recently wrote a post about The Iliad if you want to learn more about the original and the modern-day spin I added to it. We read The Song of Achilles as our Book of the Month for Hype or Like Friday, a Goodreads group I co-created with Britt and Larkin, and I\u2019m looking forward to reading the reviews. If you\u2019re a member of the group or have reviewed this book in the past, feel free to share the link to your review in the comments.I often switch up my review style, and I\u2019ve decided to break the novel into 5 categories: Writing, Characters, Plot, Historical Accuracy, and Themes.Note: If you haven\u2019t read The Iliad or are unaware of the history/mythology surrounding the Trojan War, then consider this your warning that there are major spoilers below that explain both The Iliad and The Song of Achilles in great detail.The Writing\u2026Madeline Miller\u2019s prose is so beautiful I was instantly drawn into this novel from the first page. It\u2019s really brilliant, and that\u2019s a word I\u2019ve only used to describe Stephen King\u2019s prose, so that actually means something to me in terms of quality. I\u2019m impressed with very few authors\u2019 writing style, which made this book unputdownable for me.I didn\u2019t realize until after I read the novel that Miller studied and teaches classic literature, and it really shines through. The Song of Achilles is so well written I couldn\u2019t believe this was her first novel. I avoided this one for a while because I was afraid it couldn\u2019t live up to my favorite book. I never thought a re-telling could do Homer justice, but this book knocked it out of the park.The Characters\u2026Choosing Patroclus as the narrator of this story was a BRILLIANT idea! My first thought was how can Patroclus narrate from first person POV when his death is what drives Achilles to kill Hector in a fit of rage, knowing it will lead to his own death? I don\u2019t think this counts as a spoiler considering The Iliad is over three thousand years old and most people know the story of Achilles by now. And that\u2019s not even the most important aspect of this book.I\u2019ve always loved Patroclus and Achilles together. They are The Iliad, at least they are for me. Homer never mentions they\u2019re lovers in his work, but some historians believe the reason Achilles was so distraught over Patroclus\u2019 death was because they were in a relationship. His pain would\u2019ve been real whether they were friends or lovers. Who wouldn\u2019t mourn the loss of their best friend, someone they grew up with? But that\u2019s the spin Miller takes on my favorite classic that really intrigued me.My other favorite character is Briseis, who we later meet during the Trojan War when King Agamemnon holds her captive. The Iliad starts off with Achilles fighting with Agamemnon over Briseis. It plays out almost the same but a bit different in this book. Regardless of the representation, we still get the same gist that the trio spent years living together, which is another part of The Iliad and this book I really liked. \u201cShe is in Agamemnon\u2019s custody, but she is Achilles\u2019 prize still. To violate her is a violation of Achilles himself, the gravest insult to his honor. Achilles could kill him for it, and even Menelaus would call it fair.\u201dAchilles is such a tough, strong-willed character that overpowers Patroclus\u2019 more sensitive side, but the two of them work so well together. When Achilles is about to go off the rails, it\u2019s always Patroclus that can rein him in.The Plot\u2026Patroclus was a prince, exiled and sent to live at King Peleus\u2019 court. Achilles\u2019 father wasn\u2019t keen on Patroclus and Achilles\u2019 friendship because he was no longer a prince, but Achilles chose him and that was all that mattered. Everyone listened to what the prince said, and when Achilles speaks in the book, I really felt the power behind his words. His arrogance and air of entitlement can be an issue with some readers, but I see his character from a completely different perspective than most.I like that Miller starts off with Patroclus at age five, drawing you into the world of Achilles, the handsome demi-god with skills that would\u2019ve made every Greek jealous except Patroclus. He admired Achilles, loved him from a distance for years until one day they kissed and the rest is history.When Helen of Sparta, later known as Helen of Troy, is allegedly kidnapped and taken to Troy this prompts Achilles\u2019 need to fight. In The Iliad, Aphrodite promises Paris, Prince of Troy, a beautiful woman, and Helen was considered one of the most beautiful women of that time. This is not shown in the novel, but I thought I\u2019d mention it to give you some context. The entire war and story is set in motion by Helen and Paris\u2019 relationship that angers her husband Menelaus, who convinces his brother King Agamemnon to go to war. \u201cYet this beautiful spear had been fashioned not in bitterness, but love. Its shape would fit no one\u2019s hand but Achilles\u2019, and its heft could suit no one\u2019s strength but his. And though the point was keen and deadly, the wood itself slipped under our fingers like the slender oiled strut of a lyre.\u201dSlight Confession: I shed a few tears at Patroclus\u2019 death. I cry every time I read The Iliad because it\u2019s so powerful and emotionally draining to read and feel Achilles\u2019 pain over his friend, and in this story, his lover. I won\u2019t spoil the ending for you, but I will say that I absolutely loved the conclusion to Patroclus and Achilles\u2019 story.The Historical Accuracy\u2026Everything from Odysseus\u2019 search for Achilles in a foreign court to the divine intervention from the gods was completely accurate. We see Apollo help Paris shoot the arrow that leads to Achilles\u2019 death. He tells him that Achilles might be part god but he\u2019s also man and even gods can be killed. I was afraid this book would take liberties with history. I was thoroughly pleased that did not happen here. While some things were not exactly the same, it was spot on for the most part, which made me smile every time I read another part that lived up to what I\u2019d hoped. I had so many expectations before I opened the book on my Kindle, and I\u2019m thrilled that I can Rave over The Song of Achilles for all the right reasons.The Themes\u2026There are five recurring themes in The Iliad that are also presented in this novel.Achilles knows his destiny is to be the best fighter to ever live, and when his mother Thetis, a sea goddess, tells him he will die if he goes to Troy, he chooses fame and glory over homecoming. He was raised with the assumption he would be the greatest warrior the Greeks had ever seen. While this is true, his pride is a problem that starts to wear on the Greek companies in Troy after Achilles is unable to come to a truce with Agamemnon. The last of her fire was gone; only marble remained. \u201cIt is true. But there is more, and worse that he has not said.\u201d The words came tonelessly, as a statue would speak them. \u201cIf you go to Troy, you will never return. You will die a young man there.\u201d Achilles\u2019 face went pale. \u201cIt is certain?\u201d This is what all mortals ask first, in disbelief, shock, fear. Is there no exception for me? \u201cIt is certain.\u201dWe see homecoming after the war in the Odyssey with Odysseus, but fate is determined by the Fates themselves, the spinners of life and death. Achilles\u2019 mother pleads with the gods to save her son, but his fate was already set and unavoidable. Odysseus inclines his head. \u201cTrue. But fame is a strange thing. Some men gain glory after they die, while others fade. What is admired in one generation is abhorred in another.\u201d He spread his broad hands. \u201cWe cannot say who will survive the holocaust of memory. Who knows?\u201d He smiles. \u201cPerhaps one day even I will be famous. Perhaps more famous than you.\u201dAnother important theme is the concept of honor. Achilles goes to Troy because he knows it\u2019s the honorable thing to do. He also fights with Agamemnon over Briseis because he believes that the king is a dishonorable man and by taking his war prize, who later becomes his friend, he\u2019s showing Achilles a lack of respect and therefore has not earned his in return.The Wrath of Achilles is the most notable theme of The Iliad. His anger for Agamemnon is present from the beginning of the book until the bitter end, and his anger over Patroclus\u2019 death only intensifies that fury that he\u2019s waited to unleash. He tears through Trojans like they\u2019re nothing, ripping apart their best fighters until he finally gets the chance to make Hector, Prince of Troy and best of the Trojans, suffer for what he did to his friend. Hector\u2019s eyes are wide, but he will run no longer. He says, \u201cGrant me this. Give my body to my family, when you have killed me.\u201d Achilles makes a sound like choking. \u201cThere are no bargains between lions and men. I will kill you and eat you raw.\u201d His spearpoint flies in a dark whirlwind, bright as the evening-star, to catch the hollow at Hector\u2019s throat.The one thing I really liked about The Iliad is that we saw a great deal of Hector. We saw very little of Hector in The Song of Achilles, and I suppose that\u2019s because of the first person narration by Patroclus. There\u2019s so many wonderful quotes I would\u2019ve loved to have read from The Iliad that perfectly capture the words spoken between Hector and Achilles. Hector and Achilles are such a great match for each other because they both want the fame and glory that comes with death, and I really liked Hector in The Iliad. I only wish I would\u2019ve seen more of him in this story.This may either tie or beat Red Rising for the longest review I\u2019ve ever written. I hope this all makes sense and doesn\u2019t come off as a Greek lit fangirl ramble.",

                "reviewText": "When I was in high school (mid 80\u2019s) Greek mythology (Iliad/Odyssey) was required reading. I tortured myself for hours attempting to understand the heavily worded passages filled with war and death. So, when my book club member picked \u201cThe Song of Achilles\u201d, I read the summary and feared that it would be difficult to start, never-mind finish. And while I love to read, this didn\u2019t seem like a book I would have selected or enjoyed. Yes, I like movies like \u201c300\u201d and \u201cGladiator\u201d, and TV shows like \u201cSpartacus\u201d, but was I really ready to voluntarily enter the world of the Trojan war? Guess what? I did and I really, really liked it. The language was not difficult to understand, and the novel was not so heavily worded that I had to reread the passages over and over. The writing was simple (of course I stumbled over some of the names) and filled with new and inventive plot possibilities. But the most interesting thing about this story is how the story is told. We see the rise and fall of Achilles, through the eyes of his companion/lover, Patroclus.Exiled Prince, Patroclus, meets Achilles when he is sent to live with King Peleus. Achilles is the son of Peleus and the Sea Nymph, Thetis. Achilles is confident, handsome, fearless, not to mention destined for great things. Clumsy, awkward and shy, Patroclus is everything that Achilles is not. So, when Achilles picks Patroclus as his companion, everyone is shocked and dismayed. Soon we are allowed to follow their growing relationship from young boys to grown men, and from friends to lovers.Eventually, they are sent to train with Chiron (half horse/half man/Centaur) until Achilles (commanded by his mother) is sent into hiding (as a woman) in another kingdom. There he secretly marries the princess and sires a child. Patroclus finds him and they are dispatched to fight in the war (Paris has taken Helen to Troy and won\u2019t return her). This is Achilles\u2019 opportunity to show and prove his greatness. They toll for 10 years (even overcoming a plague) outside the gates of Troy. And then, following an affront to his reputation (the greedy King Agamemnon attempted to claim one of his possessions, Briseis, who he only saved to appease Patroclus), Achilles refuses to fight until he gets an apology, although this will mean several of his people will die. Without their greatest warrior, they are doomed. Patroclus tries to reason with Achilles but to no avail. So, in an attempt to make things better (amongst the men), restore Achilles reputation and help win the war, Patroclus sets out on a fool\u2019s errand to attack the gates of Troy. Unfortunately, he is killed by Hector (Achilles arch enemy). Grieving (and dealing with a lot of guilt), Achilles sets out to avenge Patroclus\u2019 death. He will stop at nothing until he gets his revenge by killing Hector. And while he achieves his goals, he too is killed (by Paris, with the help of Apollo).What I liked:1. While you may think that Achilles is the hero or what the story is about, it is really about Patroclus, who loved him unconditionally regardless of his flaws. Yes, Achilles was beautiful, musically talented (lyre) and a skilled warrior, but he was also aloof and at times difficult. And while Patroclus saw his shortcomings, he loved him in spite of them. Eventually even giving his life to make sure that Achilles remained whole.2. The dynamic between Achilles, his mother (Thetis) and Patroclus. While Thetis never thought Patroclus was good enough for her son and never understood their love, it is his telling their life stories and their mutual love that in the end softened her outer shell (ok, kind-of). She came to understand that Patroclus loved her son.3. Briseis\u2019 story. Her words of love to Patroclus and her willingness to stay with him forever, even if that meant sharing him with Achilles was simply beautiful. Not to mention, in the end she died on her own terms, refusing to be claimed (by Agamemnon) or enslaved again.4. Achilles\u2019 rage. I could imagine what Achilles was feeling as he circled the gates of Troy dragging Hector\u2019s body behind him. I understood his grief and sympathized when he refused to give Priam his son, Hector\u2019s remains. And I could visualize Achilles leaning over and caring for Patroclus\u2019 remains, hoping that he would awaken or be resurrected.5. Achilles\u2019 death. It was beautifully written. \u201cHe turns his head a little, as if to watch it come. He closes his eyes and feels its point push through his skin, parting thick muscle, warming its way past the interlacing fingers of his ribs.\u201d Once he avenged the death of the person he loved, he had nothing really to live for. He did not want to live in a world without his soulmate.I am undecided about:1. The hasty conclusion. I would have liked to really see more of Pyrrhus\u2019 reign. I did find it ironic that unlike Achilles (who was reared by his mortal father and Chiron), his son, Pyrrhus was allowed to grow and develop under Thetis. She believed that Achilles humanness made him vulnerable, so I was curious to see did this opportunity to raise another version of Achilles make a difference. Pyrrhus, while a great warrior and strategist, was cold, entitled, selfish and mean. The opposite of Achilles, who while aloof, was able to love, and yet they both had the same fate. Neither was fated to live forever. Ironically, Achilles\u2019 son died for the same affront (claiming or taking a woman) that caused Achilles to stop fighting.In conclusion, I only touched on a few things from the book in this review. But be assured, there is a lot that made this a fascinating read. There was romance, treachery, war, passion (because there is a difference between romance and passion), tragedy and good old Greek mythology. What else do you need? 4.5 stars",

The characters come alive in this well-written novel that reimagines the lives of Achilles and Patroclus and the relationship they had with each other. The way these two are drawn to each other - their devotion, care, and love towards each other- was amazing.Prepare your tissues, though, because the ending will leave you in tears. It's beautiful though. The author gave their timeless story a fitting end, a ballad of true love between soulmates.",
