An evil Duke, James father, stalking Joanna, to make her his third wife. This family, unlike many nobles, is different in that they don\u2019t care if she marries, if she\u2019s happy. The author has done a beautiful job of creating female characters that are outspoken and not afraid of other\u2019s opinions. The kidnapping, the culmination of the horridly scary notes, is the thing that finally brings the Duke down. His own arrogance, gave them all the ammunition they needed. He was the ultimate villain, a hater of women,a narcissist. Loved the rescue, wouldn\u2019t have guessed who\u2019d come at the ninth hour. But don\u2019t want to ruin it for anyone else. Need to read it yourself.",

However, she does not use her real name. Women are not accepted as authors at this time in history. Since his evil father denies him an inheritance, James decides to build a business for personal income. Both of them are helping their younger sisters have an enjoyable London Season. The delightful dialogue and tender romance is embellished by the mystery they both need to endure. The dastardly, insulting, arrogant villain is especially disturbing by sending Joanna letters full of threats. Joanna is an intelligent, witty woman. James is a genuine hero and very kind person. This is a page turner and very enjoyable to read.",
