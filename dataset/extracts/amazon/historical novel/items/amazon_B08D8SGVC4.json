                "reviewText": "One of the best things about Historical fiction novels is sitting back in shock. There are so many issues that are not touched on in history classes or textbooks. If they are mentioned, they are usually just a quick mention.An Island at War gives insight into the struggles of the islanders stuck in the middle between England and Germany during WWII. They were soon occupied by the Germans for the duration of the war. The author went into detail sharing the struggles, the hopes, the frustrations and the fears of the islanders.My only complaint is that the ending left me hanging. Is Gerard alive? What does Rosie think of the Island when she returns? Will Hans come back for Estelle in a few years and be able to have a relationship? It does go to show how invested I became in the story. I hope you will become invested as well",

This really brought those stories to life.The writing was a pleasure to read. It flowed off the page wonderfully. It was a really good story about life on the island and the difficulty of separation caused by the war. I enjoyed the book a lot.",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoyed reading this story of life in Jersey during the German occupation. I loved the main characters, especially Estelle, her Gran and Hans, and in particular was looking forward to the ending as Estelle\u2019s friendship with Captain Hans Bauer developed (I couldn\u2019t wait!) ... and here comes the \u2018but\u2019! How disappointing the end of the book was! It just fell totally flat at the very end as if the author had suddenly run out of ideas and didn\u2019t know how to end the story. Did Gerard and Paul return safely from the war? Don\u2019t know! Did Hans ever come back to visit Jersey after the war? Don\u2019t know! Did Estelle eventually settle down with Gerard? Don\u2019t know! It was such a let-down how abruptly the book finished with the comment \u201cThey were free, finally\u201d. We all knew that anyway, as the islanders were celebrating in the square at the time with the British soldiers raising the Union Flag! I would have loved a proper ending detailing what happened to the characters just after the war, having invested a few days of my life embroiled in their lives. If a sequel was published, I would gladly buy it just to find out.",

                "reviewText": "I was lucky enough to be reading this book whilst I was on holiday / visiting Jersey for the first time and visited the War Tunnels, the docks at St Helier and the museum plus did several walks along the North coast of the island and the green lanes. I therefore could relate to places mentioned in the book. It also makes the historical facts more personal and relateable. As the book had a family at it's centre it brought the impact of the war on the different generations into focus. It also highlighted the human side of both the islanders and the Germans - showing the good and bad of both. A good read.",
