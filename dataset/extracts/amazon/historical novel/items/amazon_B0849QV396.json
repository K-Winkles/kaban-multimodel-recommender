                "reviewText": "There are so far 4 novels in this series on WWII aviation events. Author does a superior job of weaving fictional characters with actual persons from history. This entry centers on the B-24 Liberator bomber units that attacked Ploesti, Romania in August1943. The mission was to cripple Axis oil refineries in that eastern Europe nation. Fate stepped in and the overall success of the mission goal was not achieved, but not due to lack of courage from the aircrews That's the historical fact. The fictional characters are readily believable, and the situations revealed are also believable save for the one major fact that in the long run makes this such an enjoyable work of fiction. Centered on one B-24 crew, just before take-off the copilot was taken ill, so the crew was scratched for lack of a copilot not already on the mission....Here comes the catch, and warping of the history- A member of the WASP was at the base having delivered a new B-24 from the USA. She took (with none but the 9 crew members' knowledge) over as the copilot. A woman flew a combatmission on one of the costliest US bomber raids in WWII. (History bent in the fact American women wereprohibited from flying combat and WASPS were never assigned or allowed to fly aircraft outside of the North American continent. So she should not have been there nor even be considered for the role she took in the plot. Bent History, but an OUTSTANDING story. The WASP even shows up in a referral in a later book in this series when a pilot mentioned a WASP he encounter as an instructor who was \"rumored to have flown an unapproved combat mission\". Just one paragraph, but neat to see the reference ! A series well worth your investigation if such is of interest. Give it a look.",

                "reviewText": "Historical fiction is one of my favourite genres. This book was an amazing insight into the unparalleled bravery of these men and women on both sides. Thank you Buzz for sharing this great story of a little known part of history. There the wreck of a crashed liberator on the side of a mountain range in Queensland where I live. It has its own story but with the insight brought to me in this book it makes the lives of those lost pilots that much more poignant. Great read.",

                "reviewText": "The is the account of one fictional crew's experience in the 1943 raid in the German oil refineries in Romania. The story is well researched and the characters have depth making this both an enjoyable action story and a book which has something to say about the impact of war on both those who served and the civilian population.I've give four stars rather than five as the dialogue and description can be a little leaden at times (and the actions of a British Naval crew at the end help the plot at the expense of realism and the traditions of that service).",
