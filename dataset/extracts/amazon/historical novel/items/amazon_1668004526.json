Tony learned to speak English, read and write from his courtesan mother\u2019s only English patron.Orphaned after his mother passes, he travels by ship to London, where he\u2019s stolen and put on the ship named Gods Gift, traveling to this new world of \u201cVirginia\u201d as an indentured servant. Tony lives through a life of tremendous loss and unexpected cruelty as a servant.As the very first East Indian in a new land (colonial America), this story explores racial identity and the attitudes toward it in the 17th century. The story also touches on early medicine from that time period. It was quite interesting learning about that time and place in history. The writing was wonderfully done with excellent descriptives of the characters, landscapes, foods + smells.. I was pulled in and transported back in time. But be prepared as there are trigger warnings. 4 stars \u2014 Pub. 5/5/23",

                "reviewText": "The East Inidan is an epic story, and a very impressive debut novel by author Brinda Charry. It chronicles the life and adventures of Tony, as he travels from India as a young boy to London, then on to Jamestown, in the very early days of its inception.I was very interested in the details of early life in Jamestown. I know my relatives trace back to Jamestown in this early era, and it was fascinating to read about the conditions. It seems that anyone who was not moneyed found themselves working as indentured servants, working for a master in their fields or home for years, to pay off debt for their passage. As can be imagined, they were not treated well and often taken advantage of.Tony's life is hard but he manages to make the best of things and look at life optimistically, considering all he has going against him. He is often thrust into situations over which he has no control, like being sold or loaned from one overseer to another. Ultimately, he is able to take control of his life and carve out some happiness in the new world. Although there were places in the story, especially in the earlier pages, where the story dragged for me a little, ultimately I was impressed by the strong writing, well researched settings, and storytelling in the book.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Historical Fiction!",
                "reviewText": "The Author\u2019s Notes cites an Indian boy, a minor but easily forgettable character in Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream as inspiration for this brilliantly conceived story of the arrival (and survival) of the first East Indian in 1630\u2019s colonial Virginia. Buoyed by historical facts (which I absolutely loved), it is truly the author\u2019s skill as an exceptional storyteller that conveys the emotional, physical, and psychological impacts that a series of globe-trotting experiences has on a motherless boy in search of home. This novel is a Historical Fiction fan's dream! It opens in India with a very young, beloved boy who thrives in a village in the care of his courtesan mother, grandmother, and \u201cuncle.\u201d His mother\u2019s beauty (along with her sexual prowess and charms) earns the the attention and benevolence of a prominent English merchant who also delights in the boy\u2019s intelligence and inquisitiveness. Befriended by a priest who baptizes and renames him Tony - it becomes his frequently used adopted name and over time he forgets his birth name - one of many losses to come in his extraordinary life. As in these times, illness strikes frequently, this time in the form of cholera, leaving him orphaned, destitute, and depressed. In an act of good faith (and maybe good riddance), the merchant finds him a benefactor and Tony embarks on a trip to London (under the guise of adventure) only to arrive alone when his benefactor succumbs to illness en route. In London, fortune continues to alternately smile and frown our darlingTony and through a set of heartbreaking circumstances, he eventually arrives in the American colonies impoverished and emaciated in servitude against his will. Avoiding spoilers, the story continues with Tony\u2019s maturation into manhood that mirrors Virginia\u2019s struggles and warped development as an emerging colony. While Tony fends off sickness, starvation, brutal beatings and molestation from overseers, exhaustion from overwork, protection from the New World environs (weather, nature (and all that\u2019s in it - snakebites, pestilence, etc) and hostile Native Americans), Virginia grapples with the increasing demand for bodies to clear the wilderness to farm and cultivate the highly desired tobacco (Tony witnesses indentured servitude morph into chattel slavery), wrestle with local politics, royal governance, allegiance to the Crown, disputes with Maryland, a quest for independence, and the unrelenting \u201cIndian\u201d problem.The characters are relatable and full-bodied \u2013 I was fond of the majority of Tony\u2019s friends \u2013 their hopes, wishes, dreams are conveyed in such a way that the reader empathizes and sympathizes with our unsung heroes and despises the loathsome villains. The landscape descriptions offer vivid imagery; the language and vocabulary choices are period-perfect (yet easy to deduce given the context for the modern reader , although I still researched a few). Highly recommended for those interested in the founding of America and the plight of marginalized/minority groups in early America.Thanks to the publisher, Scribner, and NetGalley for an opportunity to review.",
