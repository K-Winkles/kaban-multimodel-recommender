All people should read this book to explain to themselves how hatred and power can can be devastating, if allowed to exist and grow. It is a lesson to be learned as a preventative to future evil and a reminder of how life, itself, can easily be destroyed.",

Read and you will have an idea, but still it is unimaginable what those innocent people lived. I can't describe how I felt reading this book and how I still feel about it. Atrocious, barbaric, gruesome, shocking, horrific, abominable, outrageous. The most shocking is that all this mass murder of innocent people went on for years and the rest of the world and most European countries consented to that. How much more barbaric can this get? My huge respect to those who risked their lives to save some of them. Unfortunately, millions were gone for just being who they were. Nothing else. I'm not even someone religious and religion is the opium of the people, but murdering innocent people just because they are from a religious group is barbaric, criminal, atrocious. Those who envied the hardworking prosperous Jewish people should have just worked as hard as them instead of trying to get rid of them. Envy is the most harmful emotion. Empathy is the most important one, but few are really empathetic. Very sad.",
