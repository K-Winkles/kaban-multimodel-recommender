Edwards and Alyson Richman\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fThis story is told from the Civil War Era and I always loved to read and learn about this trying time in our history.In New Orleans, we meet Stella, who is a slave to a not so nice man, Mr. Frye. Stella decides to try to help her love William, who is a black Union soldier and an awesome musician, by sewing maps to help the enslaved men flee to freedom. She is gathering the information for her maps from Mr. Frye and knows that he will kill her if he figures it out.Then we have Lily, who is in New York City and a Jewish woman. Her husband is in the Union Army and stationed in Louisiana. She sewed a quilt and stashed sheet music hidden within the quilt for her husband Jacob the musician. Lily and Jacob write often, and he tells her about his friend William the gifted musician. But when months go by and Lily gets no letters, she goes in search for husband.When these two special ladies meet by chance, they come together to save their loved ones!I really liked this book and the sewing reminded me so much of my grandmother. I can't wait to discuss with @bookfriendsbookclub Sunday.#crazybooknerd #bookstagram #lovehistoricalfiction #bookfriendsbookclub #lovediscussinggreatbooks",

                "reviewText": "I just finished reading The Thread Collectors, and was moved by this story of hardship, friendship, war and political division, discrimination and survival during the Civil War. It did a wonderful job of capturing two perspectives--Black and Jewish--not often captured in historical fiction of that era. I loved that the story was inspired by the two authors' friendship and their family histories.I was inspired by the creative ways the two main women got involved in supporting the Union (Stella with the maps she sewed, Lily with the quilts and bandages). I also appreciated that it wasn't just about the women's perspective, but also captured the men's experience. I loved the brotherly bond that developed between William and Jacob through their love of music. There were several realistic scenes about some of the traumas endured during those times that were deeply moving (and could warrant a trigger warning).Highly recommend, and look forward to reading some of Alyson Richman's other books (and hopefully other books by Shaunna J. Edwards).",
