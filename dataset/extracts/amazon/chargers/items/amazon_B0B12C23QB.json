I found the reason is due to usb port, only usb-c port is still charging my iPhone, the usb-a port is not working anymore for my iPhone X. Actually I was purchasing usb-c to lighting charging cable, but by mistake I bought this cable, which is usb-a to lighting cable. After I received this cable I tried it, the magical thing happened, it works! With this cable my other two chargers are working again. I don\u2019t know the reason, but do appreciate the good quality of this cable!",
