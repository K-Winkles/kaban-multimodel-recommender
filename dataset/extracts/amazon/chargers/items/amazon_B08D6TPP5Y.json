Looks just like the apple charger. I always lose my charger and always have a low battery phone. This pack was amazing- an incredibly low price for 4 cords! I now have them on my night stand, in my car, husband truck, and kitchen! So nice to have a charger in different areas of the house so I don\u2019t have to keep moving one around the house!! Definitely get yourself a pack!!!",

Durability and sturdiness don\u2019t matter much if they don\u2019t charge the device.UPDATE\u2014These are fine. It turned out it was my phone port.
