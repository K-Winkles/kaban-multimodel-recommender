Both wall bricks/adapters are 12W, it says so on the brick itself, not 20W as advertised on the product page. They charge pretty slow, im wondering if they are even 12W since that might be a lie too. Im keeping them for convenience at this point, otherwise, I'd avoid. You can get better ones for around the same price or less on here.",
