The price is awesome for 2 chargers and it chargers my phone fast and the phone actually holds the charge now. For months my phone was going from 100% to 50% within 30 mins after charging. Then it would slowly go down from there but after charging my phone once with this charger it went down at a normal rate. I'm so glad I purchased this! I do recommend it! I just got it today but I'm hopeful it continues to work for a while...",
