They are not the longest, being only 6 feet, but the are long enough for the car or if the USB is near you.They look nice and the colors actually make them easy to spot, which is great. We haven't had any of the fraying issues with them that we have had with other cords, especially the Apple ones that come with the phones.No splitting and all three charge and work fine, which is great because a lot of times ordering cords from Amazon means you may get a dud. We did not and all three are great.",
