                "reviewText": "July 8, 2022 - I admit i have stopped swapping them and when only charging via one part i stopped swapping ports (I wanted to test both of these and all four ports for review purposes due to all the \"these are junk and caught fire\" type of reviews) ... I think OVERALL i felt these get warm ...3 times maybe ... and on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being \"oh crap, this is a fire harzard and i need something to grab onto this before my room burns up\") .... i think MAYBE i'd say a .50 out of 10 ... slighltly warm and within a minute of two of being unplugged it was not noticable and i USE THESE REGULARLY with different cords and devices ... almost daily with something i need to charge and NO PROBLEMS at all. I do have to mention those three times max was AT LEAST when the charger was plugged in 2+ hours and even with the same cord and device, and outlet and plugged into the same \"port\" ... it doesn't happen again for months ... so it's not like one bad cable or wall outlet is causing that RARE (.50 out of 10) \"heating\" issue ... IF i had any doubts i'd say it and not recommend these ... I forgot when i bought these but it's been months and I am still happy with these and not even questioning if they are safeFeb 2022 Update: I fully admit i forgot when i orginally bought it and also i only may have swapped them ONCE since the last update ... still NOT getting burning hot like some reviews mention... still charging a-ok ... I may swap the ones I use regularly after typing this just as a test but just wanted to say months later and as someone who was concerned over the bad reviews ... everything is peachy here .. no problems at all and I do charge things at LEAST somewhat regularlyUpdate from Mid October: Swaping both of them just to see if there are any issues and everything is still a-ok.... the one point I want to make in this update is that I have said i have swapped ports and cables and devices, just to test things out ... I KNOW these are not \"fast chargers\" but I have charged things in both adapters with things plugged into each side and ... while I do have another OLD dual usb port wall charger (I got these as a backup, as so many things I own now need to be charged this way) ... the speed of which both items charge seem normal to me ... as advertised for those products and no issues afterwards.The fire warnings from some negative reviews still worries me and just in case I only use them when i am right next to where they are so i could test (for heat) and/or yank them out fast ... but so far ... no issues or SIGNS Of issues of any kindUpdate: Week 1 of October and I do use these regularly ... DUE TO the negative reviews I have been doing my best to switch cables (even if dont need to ... like different micro usb cables, different usb c cables ....etc) and even though i admit i have been forgetting (I charge thing REGULARLY) ... doing my best, to remember to switch not only chargers between the two ... but ports .... so far ... i think i have said this in my original review ... is not related to the cable or device specifically .. SOMETIMES (rare ... say 1 out of every .. oh 20 charges ... i am sort of making that up i admit) i feel a slight warmed to the charger only when it's plugged into the wall outlet.... say on a scale 1 to 10 ... 10 being \"this is going to cause a fire\"/\"so hot i cant touch it\" ... now I'd say ... a .25 maybe out of 10 ... barely a 1 .. .noticable when i do feel that but ... i cant say any other charger I have had, doesn't have the same thing happen.i am concerned about any fire danger due to the reviews from others but ... so far my two .... have been A-OK for a few months now.Also some 1 out of 5 reviews complain this is not a \"fast\" charger.... I KNEW THAT when I bought them. f you need a fast charger .... they are always more $$ then what looks the same but is a regular charger ... IF THAT Is what you need ... look for something like \"supports QUalcomm fast charge technology\" or something ... just \"this chargers fast\" in the general discription may be common even if its a regular charger (say 2-3 hours for devices on a regular charger but a fast charger could do it on 45minutes to 1 hour) ...some of the 1 out of 5 star reviews may have come from people that just didn't read what this charger could do .....Update: It's now in the first week or so of September ... I admit I stopped (maybe i should start up again) switching between the two adapters and between each plug on each adapter as much as I was doing a few weeks back ... I am not sure i'd trust this (ONLY based on the bad reviews alone) leave this plugged in when I am not right next to them to yank them from the wall if there was an issue but ... STILL TO THIS DAY ... and many things being charged ... no problems at all and I cant remember what I was charging when the adapter got a little (say maybe ... oh a 1 ... 1.5 maybe out of 10 ... 10 \"being a problem\" .... but I have NOT noticed either adapter even getting slightly warm to any degree since then ... everything is a-ok so far(Another Update ... less than 30 days ... though i forgot when i posted the update below) ... I am going back and forth between the two items and TRYING to remember to use both ports on each one ... so far NO funny sounds, i guess at times i'd say they'd get SLIGHLY warm when plugged into the wall (say a 1 out of 10 MAX .. enough to notice but BARELY enough to mention ... I JUST MENTION IT @ the reviews that say how hot theirs are .... and to be fair I dont mess with \"possible fires\" ... if i dont 100% trust these I will not use them again) .... SO FAR ... everything is a-ok and I do use them ALOT-----Update (still less than 30 days from purchase but with many different devices charged via usb c or micro-usb cable) SO far ... admitting some negative reviews say issues come up in say month 2 or a little after that ... everything is a-ok ... To address the \"heat\" problem i was worried about reading some reviews ... WHEN PLUGGED IN only ... on a scale from 1 to 10 ... 10 being \"too hot to touch\" ... the honest i have felt it got ... (and only SOMETIMES) would be when it was plugged in for awhile and it would be a ... 1.5 to a 2 MAX ... if that ... i leave it unplugged (due to those negative reviews and \"mine caught fire\") when i am not around if something bad happens... but ... having said that ... I dont worry too much about that when i am in the house .... these dont feel like the cheapest plastics made and probably POOR electronics on the inside .... I trust them or i'd never plug my stuff into them ... I just dont want to take a change, is all.I'd recommend them so far even if i wish they'd offer say a 1pk for $4.50 or something (just got these as a backup to my one wall charger I 've had since 2013, that is still working great)-----------I have to preference that these are first impressions and while I have not checked the 4th port ... I have charged a few different devices already and tested both plugs and 3 out of the 4 total usb ports.I am not going to open them up but they dont feel super cheap or anything ... smaller than my old white PowerGen 2.1A White charger from about 2013 (still have it and it works fine all these years later ... i just got these for a backup).I am not going to say the are \"SUPER high quality\" or go overboard in anyway like that but the prongs seem normal and unlike some reviews I read in no way do they feel like they bend easy or fall out of outlets. I do know that some reviews mention things being fine for awhile and THEN issues start, but so far I have not seen or felt anything fishy. I DO NOT take chances with electricity being involved but with the few things I have charged .. neither adapter feels hot in any way (maybe say a .5 out of 10, when plugged in for awhile, but that is charging two devices and i say that is normal) ... also I do not hear any noise of any kind coming from the charger.I will be SURE to update this review either way, as time goes on, but fearing a really cheap product and not wanting to mix that with electricity of course, so far ... I am pretty happy with my purchase ... I probably only needed one since my old charger still works, but ah well",
