                "reviewText": "I purchased this around Christmas for my son. He had everything scattered everywhere and half the time, kept misplacing his airpods. This is the only one so far you don\u2019t have to take the phone case off in order to charge which is a plus! Now he has a habit of putting everything to charge before bed. This is such an awesome price and good quality. Highly recommend:)",
