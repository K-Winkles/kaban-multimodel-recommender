I have an iPhone 14 max plus and have to have a long charging cord due to the furniture vs outlets situation. I had a 6+\u2019 cord for a few years that finally died. I replaced it with a brand I was unfamiliar with and they only lasted a few months so I bought these. I like the fact that it is a fabric type cord instead of a plastic type. It seems to be sturdier. I have noticed that it doesn\u2019t charge as quickly as my original cord even though I have it plugged into a lightening adapter but it doesn\u2019t crawl so I am ok with it. I do like the fact that there are 3 in the pack so I don\u2019t have to keep moving them around. The colors are nice too. And the price was right on. Overall I am pleased with my purchase.",
