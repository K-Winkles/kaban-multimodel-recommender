                "reviewText": "This is a very nicely built unit, it does not feel cheap at all and is a good value for the price. It has no issues charging multiple devices at once, but do pay attention to what ports share a charging circuit.I did have one significant issue with it, and that is it would not charge either of my Nintendo Switch controllers, one the official Pro controller and one an aftermarket. It turned out to be something with the USB-A to USB-C cables that came with each controller. When I used a regular USB-C cable, it worked. So this will charge Switch controllers, you will just need a different cable.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a USB hub with three USB A and three USB C ports, and overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. This hub has made it much easier for me to connect all of my devices to my computer, and I appreciate the fact that it has a mix of USB A and USB C ports.In terms of performance, the hub works well and I haven't experienced any issues with it. All of the ports seem to function properly, and I've been able to connect multiple devices at once without any issues.The only minor complaint I have about this hub is that the ports provide around 15% less power than advertised. This might be due to my setup, but I've noticed that some devices charge slightly slower than I expected when connected to this hub. However, this hasn't been a major issue for me, and the hub still provides enough power to charge my devices.Overall, I think this USB hub is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to others. The mix of USB A and USB C ports is a nice touch, and it has made it much easier for me to connect all of my devices to my computer. While the slightly lower power output is a minor downside, it hasn't affected my overall experience with the hub, and I still think it's a great product that's worth considering if you need more USB ports for your devices.",
