Durable to heavy use by teenagers. Great price and quality!",

As someone who regularly uses my Samsung phone, the Super Fast Charging is a must have to keep business going as well as updated on kids' activities. When I saw this pack of chargers, I definitely was impressed with the price point. When the chargers got here, I was ultimately shocked to see a charging cord long enough to freely move in the area I'm charging and the super fast charging was honestly what seemed faster than the original charger that came with my phone.This is perfect for replacing your charging cords that won't break the bank and that quality stands well above the price value.",
