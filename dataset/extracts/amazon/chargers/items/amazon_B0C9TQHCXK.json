                "reviewText": "I never write reviews but these earbuds are so awesome. I'm not sure why there are bad reviews but I have had mine for about a month and just bought my son a pair and the best thing about them is the battery life. I work 12 hr shifts, sometimes 16 hrs and keep one in my ear all day, and the charge will last a couple of days before I have to recharge them. The sound is great, I love the colors, and I have no issues keeping them in my ears all day long. I've never been able to do that bc they've always hurt my ears after awhile. These are comfortable and don't hurt at all. Love these and the price is amazing. I will continue to buy these as needed & will update if I have any issues. Buy these!",

                "reviewText": "I don't write a lot of product reviews. It's easy to use the left, right, or both. I usually listen using a single. These paired easily and the sound quality was good. Unfortunately, the left earbud is now significantly quieter than the right. I've tried everything to reset, make sure there is nothing blocking, etc.. My main frustration with these is that they are extremely sensitive. When I'm in the pool or the shower they are constantly toggling play/pause and volume up and down. I do like them, but it is a significant source of frustration if anything even remotely comes near them (hat, hair, water drops...anything).",

I wish the indicator light in the box was more explanatory. there is no info on why it would flash amber. you would think that would mean its low, and to put on the charger... so I did, but, they just continue to flash amber...so I do not believe its seeing its on the charger.. I mean the website has NO support. You cant even contact them. The website shows the little light blue.. so apparently it can change colors... Just dont waste your money.. no way these are worth $30 bucks as listed on their website.. i paid $20 just to get the green ones, but no.... no way these are worth more then $12 tops.",
