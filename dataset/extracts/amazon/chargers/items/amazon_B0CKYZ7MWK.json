                "reviewText": "I was in need of an additional phone charger; my teenager's charger failed and was constantly asking to use mine. Saw these listed at a great price for a pack of three. Delivered next day and put to use immediately, really liked the fast charge and the length allowed me to plug in a distance away from my desk. My teen also put to use and loved the as they were able to use in bed or move around without having to use an extension cord. Quality seems excellent, braided and flexible. If I need any more chargers, would definitely buy this product again.",
