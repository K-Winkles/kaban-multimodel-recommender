                "reviewText": "I originally bought this to fast charge my new Iphone 15 in the car. I noticed when initially starting my car and plugging in the usb-c cable my phone would rapidly go in and out of charging mode, like it could not put out enough juice for my phone to recognize power coming from the charger. After 5-10 of driving it would finally be able to put out consistent power but even then my phone would charge super slow. Only after 20-30 min could a reasonable rate of charge be achieved. And this was doubly slow if any other devices were also charging in the other port. I even went as far as replacing my car battery (needed to be replaced anyways) and while this seemed to slightly help with the flickering in and out of charge the speed of the charger was still very slow at first. I tested this out in my wife's car and observed similar poor charging. I requested a replacement which seemed to work better at first but after a week the same issues were occurring (charge flickering, slow charge until driving 20+ min, etc.). I wanted this product to work out because I really like being able to fast charge my phone in a pinch but this car charger is just too inconsistent and just doesn't do the job when I need it to. There are far better car charger adapters out there.",
