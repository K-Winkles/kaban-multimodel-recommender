                "reviewText": "These are USB Type A (standard USB) to Lightning Connector Cables. Apple iPhone transitioned from their previous proprietary connector to the lightning connector in 2012 with their iPhone 5. Apple has recently transitioned from Lightning Connectors to USB-C connectors with the iPhone 15. So these cables are useful for anyone using an iPhone 5 - iPhone 14 (charging, attaching for data transfer, etc.).The cables are well made and seem better built than the standard rubber-jacketed cables that come \"free\" with most devices you purchase. They have a nylon braided jacket like many after market cables which gives them a higher quality and more durable feel. So these are an upgrade to what most devices come with.The cables I purchased are 6 feet long, which is pretty long. For some uses, this is ideal. For other uses, having something shorter (like the available 3 foot cables) would make more sense. Certainly, these are flexible and can be folded up, so they will work in place of a shorter cable, but if you are specifically purchasing these for attachment to a portable battery charger or for connecting to your car, I would probably get something shorter than 6 foot (like the 3 foot version). 6 foot is great for attaching to wall chargers around the house.These cables are a good value for their current price. Cables can get much more expensive. So you get a quality set of cables at a good value.The unique thing about these cables are the colors. You get pink, blue, and green, so you get a variety. However, these are fairly unique \"pastel\" colors. I have not seen a lot of cables in these colors. My son really likes the green and blue cables (not so much the pink, but he has used it around the house). The pictures on Amazon for these cables is accurate. If you like these colors and want a quality and good value cable, these are great.",

I was a bit hesitant at first to purchase an off brand product since I was worried it would damage my phone, but I have been pleasantly surprised so far. This is a fairly standard cable and product being that it does its job; it works.In addition to it working fine, I like that it comes in three different colors as it adds a nice flair to my tech. Aside from the aesthetics, I have found the cable to be very durable and flexible which is an added bonus! I also like that it is 6 feet in length as this gives you more flexibility to use your phone from a further location while it is still charging. A great purchase overall!",
