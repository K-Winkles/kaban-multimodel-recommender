I really like the variety of lengths included as they work well for different locations around the house, at my office, or in my car. The cables are durable and covered in a flexible fabric-like outer material - so much better than regular plastic. I would definitely buy these again.",

It's perfect for you if you want to leave a charger in different places. Personally I use one for my bed, one for my car, and one for a power bank so I'm not losing them. Good replacement overall.",

As nice as the price is, I\u2019m buying better cables before these wear out.",
