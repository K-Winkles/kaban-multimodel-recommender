First of all I somehow missed that this was a TWO PACK, so that's awesome I only needed one to replace so I have a backup now in case I need it! The cords are super long which is a plus and comes with two power boxes to plug into the wall. It is truly fast charging!",

This fast charger was a great price so I decided buying it. Boy was I happy when I got it. It went from about 3% to 50% in a little over a hour. Granted that was with me being busy half the time also playing games on my phone. My old charger would barely charge it to 15% in an hour. Honestly. It beats spending $10 for one at wal-mart.",

                "reviewText": "I'm using Samsung A54 5G phone, look at my 2 photos uploaded side-by-side (green is reviewed for this 25W version) vs red (other generic GaN 65W adapter sold here). They both used identical phone on Android 14 with 85% hard limit and super fast charging enabled. I can't get the red version to even show \"super fast charging\" while the green has no issue charging up in half the time 42 to 85% in just 28minutes!!!! I can't speak for iPhone but Android users running version 14 should have no problem getting same results. This product does not have A54 listed but I confirmed it works exactly at 25W! To the person complaining why they took Samsung logo off well it's because it's illegal. And anyone having issue, make sure you're getting from vendor shijiazhuanghoucha. He got 2 set deal going on under 8 so I have zero expectation and just tested the product an hour ago upon arrival and was blown away that it works exactly as I've been searching, I wasted so much money on garbage that don't work. If you have an A54, just get it!",
