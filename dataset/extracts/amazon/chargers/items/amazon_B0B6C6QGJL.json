The coiled cord is very convenient for in-vehicle use -- avoids having to deal with excessive length, while allowing me to pick up the phone while connected when necessary. The cord and connectors appear to be well-made. Too early to determine durability.",

The one I had was too long really, and I had it coiled up and, in the way, \u2013 way too bulky as well. This seemed to be a great solution.I felt that this was a good value getting 2 coiled cables at this price. They seem sturdy and work fine with my iPhone 14 Pro. I tested both of them. They stretch out long enough but aren\u2019t in the way when not plugged in. They\u2019re easy to store as well. There\u2019s also a code to scan with your phone\u2019s camera that takes you to a Facebook Messenger chat to request an upgraded 2-year warranty.I was fortunate that it did not affect me, but the only thing I did not like was that to use Apple CarPlay, it takes a little extra work in some cases as the instructions imply. This requires going into settings in your phone to get these cables to work in some cases. However, it worked just fine with the USB plug in my 2016 F150. In this case, it is an updated USB that I purchased from Ford because 2017 is when they started making USB plugins compatible with CarPlay, so I don\u2019t know if this had anything to do with it or not. My other vehicle is older and has no USB outlets at all. In it, I had to use a USB cigarette lighter plug and it worked just fine with that too.Hopefully this helps someone decide on this product.5 stars.",
