It was more or less a random choice, but the description and photo were better than others. The one thing that I really like about it is the cord is NOT removable and there is a slot for a second cord. When plugged into the charging \"orifice\" in the car, there is a bright blue light that comes on to let the user know that it is ready to use. It is easy to see in daylight or darkness. This was not the case with my previous one. It also fits snugly when plugged in - no fiddling with it to make sure that it works.",
