She has lost her cable for her AirPods and the school didn\u2019t provide her with a cable/charger for her issued iPad. It\u2019s working perfectly keeping her devices charged! We\u2019re going to keep the 2nd set as a backup. We\u2019re very happy with this purchase!",

At first I thought it was just a bad cable, but I went through several cables with the same result. Other family members had the same experience with the cables that they tried.",
