                "reviewText": "Like many others, I was looking for one or more wireless chargers to place in heavily used areas around my home. I ordered a pack of four from another source, and the USB-C/USB-C adapter totally came apart when trying to separate. I still liked the concept and decided to order this 2-pack. I've not been disappointed. I've owned these now for about four months, and they appear to be doing exactly what they're supposed to do. These are not as fast as wired, of course, but charging completes in a reasonable amount of time. Hopefully, they won't diminish my iPhone 13+ battery level considerably as I have heard this can occur. If I purchase more of this type wireless charger, I'm hopeful a newer model will have a cable that detaches from the charging base. Great product(s) at a great price!",
