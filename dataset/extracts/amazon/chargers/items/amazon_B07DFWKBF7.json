                "reviewText": "Whenever I need an accessory, especially charging equipment, I always go to Anker first and this is no different. This charger is really well made. While it is smooth, glossy plastic, there is a good amount of heft to it. The charger has had no issues and is well made from front to back The foldable prongs are also great and have a strong and tight feel to them. For the price and quality, these are unbeatable!Pros- Very high quality- Good value- Reputable companyCons- None",

                "reviewText": "I have a bunch of these, as well as other Anker products, and never had an issue. These are not super speed chargers, nor is that why I bought them. Have a couple plugged in the kitchen outlets, and a couple in a go bag for vacations and such. These days, everything needs to charge, phones, headsets, work headsets, and many other devices. Far better than your checkout counter chargers, which I have had to buy in a pinch, and always seem to fit loosely in outlets, these do not have that problem. Now I have enough of these spread around, including one in my truck as a just in case on the road, that I am ready for any charging need where ever I may be. Being able to fold in the prongs makes them take up less room, though they are compact anyways.",

Are sending new product to replace defective one at no charge and I don\u2019t even have to send old one back!Very courteous and helpful. Have updated my rating from 2 stars to 5.I ordered the 2 pack of these wall charger outlets, and one of them worked perfectly, the other was defective. The first one worked great, charged devices very quickly.I tried the other, and all the device would do is flash very quickly between charging and not charging. I tried it on different devices and different outlets in my home, and same thing.I have used Anker products for years, and have never had a problem with them working flawlessly. But I have to say that I am disappointed with these. Since it happened immediately out of the box, it must have left the factory this way. I would think quality control would have caught this defect.",

However it is still a powerful charger with 5V 2.4A output for a single device. I already have one capable of doing 5V 2.4A for two devices, but it's larger than this one. As a repeat Anker customer I had high expectations and as usual I wasn't disappointed. Looks, feels, and performs great. Zero issues and works exactly how I want/need it to. It's also quite affordable especially considering its output and quality. The price is even better considering the one or two times I've used the Anker warranty I didn't wait long at all, and they simply replaced the item, no hassle whatsoever.",
