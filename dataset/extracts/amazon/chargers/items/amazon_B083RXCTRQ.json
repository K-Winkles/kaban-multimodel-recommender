So far none of these have died and I purchased our first ones back in April 2023. The reason I have to buy more is because my kids steal them, then lose them or give them to their friends (if you ask them these are all lies) \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude44They charge quick, don\u2019t make your things overheat and none of the braiding has torn or come away from the wires.You can\u2019t go wrong and you\u2019ll pay twice as much for one crappy one at the gas station next time you\u2019re in a bind, so might as well and throw one in your console.",

By May 2023, one year since buying, every cord has stopped working. Some lasting longer than others but none making it to the post 1 year mark. Cheap enough that they don\u2019t get a 1 star review because of this but I wouldn\u2019t really recommend buying if you have other options.",
