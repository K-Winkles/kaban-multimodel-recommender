I\u2019ve never had any issue with cables breaking prematurely before, and with this pack, every single one showed some sign of damage within a couple uses. The one that\u2019s shown up every time with all three cables has been that I will plug them into my phone and they just won\u2019t charge. I\u2019ll turn them around and they MIGHT charge. Most of the time I\u2019ll have to turn the charger 3-5 times before it finally charges. Which of course, has led to damage of the cord itself, thus making the chargers last less time than they should. The pack was alright for the price, but I\u2019ve never had this many damage issues when it comes to chargers before so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it to me to order again, I\u2019m afraid. It could\u2019ve just been that I got a faulty pack or something, but I don\u2019t want to take the risk again.",
