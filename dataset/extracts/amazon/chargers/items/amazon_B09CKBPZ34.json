I find that this works really well because some people who have different ends on their Chargers might need one or the other option additionally those who have iPhones versus Androids might also just have the USBC as a post to the USB C and so I find that this has worked really well in fact one of my tenants in my Airbnb enjoyed these so well that they took it when they left so it's very quick and easy and I definitely recommend. The one thing that I would say is if there is a way to improve on the product that would be to collapse the plug into the wall so that it doesn't stick out when you're not using it and if you want to travel with it that would make it a little bit easier",
