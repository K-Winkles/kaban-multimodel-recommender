                "reviewText": "I purchased two of these a few months back after borrowing a friends and loved them so much I got each of my kids one for Christmas this year. I love that you don't have to keep up with a charging cable or a block, you can just plug it into a wall outlet to recharge and all of the output charging cords are attached (and everything tucks into the charger until you are ready to use them). It does take a little while for a full charge but I just plug it in overnight after use. There is an LED display that tells you what the capacity is on the charger (0-100). When it has a full charge two or three people can easily use it to charge up their devices. It's been perfect at all-day sporting events with the kids, no need to find an outlet and sit and wait. It's about the size of an iPhone so it's super portable. A great value for the price! And a side note - one of my original two got dropped and the corner got a little banged up so the wall plug doesn't always work now, and I can still charge it the \"old\" way using a cable, so even though it's not as convenient the charger itself still works.",

She loves that it plugs directly into the wall to recharge, the convenience of not having to carry extra cords and how quickly it charges her devices. She has other portable chargers but reaches for this one the most because it is also light compared to what she already had. Highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to get a backup charger for my wife for her to take with her when she travels in case she can't get to an outlet or use a car charger. This one has pretty great capacity at 10,000 mah, and I like the fact it is self-contained, with a fold out charging plug for the unit and cables for the devices built right in. It works great with her iphone, and it does have the iphone lightening charger plug as one of the options. That didn't seem totally clear in the advertisement, because iphone has now gone to a USB charging port instead of the lightening proprietary plug, so was glad to see that feature here. You can use it as a pass-through charger, to charge your phone or other device while it is plugged in. Came initially charged at 78%, took about 2 1/2 hours plugged in to a wall outlet to reach 100%. I tried it on my phone, which is in an Otter Box Defender series, and the plug would not fit due to the case, so if you have one of the heavier phone cases because you drop your phone a lot, you might have to take it out of the case to charge it with this battery pack. Not too big of a problem. My wife has a lighter duty Otter Box Commuter Series case on her phone, and the plug reaches in and connects with no problem. If the battery lasts like they say it should, this will be a great backup. Should get at least 2, maybe three full charges out of it before needing to recharge the unit's battery pack.",
