                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the power bank for charging my phone, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. The compact design makes it incredibly portable, allowing me to easily slip it into my pocket or bag without any bulkiness. One of the features of this power bank is its impressive charging capacity. With this power bank, I can charge my phone multiple times on a single charge. It's a lifesaver, especially during long commutes or travels when access to a power outlet is limited. Furthermore, the build quality is top-notch. The power bank feels solid and well-constructed, providing me with confidence in its durability. The sleek design adds a touch of elegance, making it a stylish accessory to carry around. Additionally, the intelligent charging technology incorporated in this power bank is a game-changer. It automatically detects the optimal charging speed for my phone, preventing any potential damage from overcharging. This feature gives me peace of mind knowing that my device is safe and protected. The battery indicator is another useful feature that deserves mentioning. It accurately shows the remaining power, allowing me to plan my charging needs accordingly. It's a small detail, but it makes a big difference in ensuring that I never run out of power unexpectedly. Overall, I highly recommend this power bank for anyone in need of a reliable and efficient charging solution.",

                "reviewText": "The portable charger arrived pretty fast (thanks to Amazon Prime). It was only 80% charged when I opened it but it took less than 30 minutes to have it fully (100%) charged. I got this for my wife as she works long shifts & doesn't have a chance to recharge her iPhone and so this is a life saver for her. I just have to make sure she charges this as well as her iPhone when she gets home.This is a very compact charger, almost a size of a lipstick tube & its very smooth all around making it perfect to drop it in her side pockets (or purse) & its 4800mAh capacity is good enough to charge her phone for at least once when she runs out of juice in the afternoon. This is supposedly MFi certified which hopefully means that it would continue working 'till the charger's battery is completely depleted and not when the Lightening interface stops working as it has been with many of my iPhone charger cables.The charger comes with a USB-C cable but no adapter which means you have to use your own adapter which I recommend to be 2 amp. The max DC voltage is 5 volt and so the adapter would be 10w charger. Using my 2A charger, it initially went from 80 to 100% in less than 30 minutes and in another occasion after it reached 20%, it took less than 2 hours to fully charge it.I don't have the tools to ascertain for sure that this is in fact a 4800 mAh battery bank but on one occasion when the iPhone was down to only 10% capacity, it did fully charge my iPhone & still was showing 25% battery left; my iPhone 12 has a 2815 mAh battery and so I was thinking that the battery bank should at least be at 50% but then there are other factors that can affect battery storage capacity such as temperature or age of the battery so I'm not making any conclusion here other than saying that it would at least fully charge your iPhone once but not your iPad (8th or 9th Gen) but then again it wasn't really meant for those devices.The charger also comes with a light mode. It's activated by pressing & holding the button on side of the unit for 1-2s to turn it on & then clicking again to switch the light color from warm to white & to warm white, the last one would be a SOS mode with lights flashing. The lights might be a plus for some but I think it's more of a gimmick as iPhone has a working light that works just fine.I would be careful using this with a thick case especially those that covers the charging port. I have a light silicon case that has ample room to allow the lightning connection but I doubt it would work for most Otterbox (like the defender series) or full protective cases out there.In the end, this is meant for those who want a very light emergency power-bank & not a true power-bank that can charge your iPad or even non-apple devices. it's an elegant solution @ a reasonable cost but if you're expecting an all around solution for anything else, you should look elsewhere.",
