                "reviewText": "Versatile, compact USB C (PD/PPS) and USB A (QUIC 3.0) multi-charger. *Caveat: None of these low-cost USB multi-chargers can actually achieve their advertised output - make sure you know what your charging needs are!* While not the highest power unit, for the price, this performs well and is solidly built. I can effectively use 7 of the 8 ports at the same time. I Super-Fast Charge my Galaxy S23, use a QIC 3.0 (USB A) wireless charger, Fast Charge my Samsung tablet, and standard charge (5 watts) 3 other devices (USB A). I don't have a USB C charging laptop, so can't comment on that, I use the high output USB C port for my S23. The unit runs cool, only mildly warming up when under full load, both the USB C & A ports are sized properly. There is a blue led light to show the unit is plugged in, but the way it is set in the body, not easy to view. I took 1 star off for 2 reasons, not really related to the charger itself. 1. You really need to do your homework before buying any of these low-cost chargers, they make it sound like you can use all available ports at full power simultaneously (which is almost never the case), although I give credit, in the Amazon description it does allude to this. 2. The owner's manual is essentially useless. Initially, I was unable to Super-Fast and Fast Charge 3 different devices simultaneously, until with a little experimentation I used the right combination of ports.",
