After filling in the warranty info and submitting the return paperwork I received a new charger in a few days. It's nice to know there are companies out there who truly stand behind their product. Thank you Syncwire!! I would definitely buy from them again!",

Kommt man allerdings in einen Stau der l\u00e4nger dauert, kommt das gute St\u00fcck schnell an seine Grenzen, wenn die Akku-Ladung zur Neige geht. Da mir das k\u00fcrzlich passiert ist, habe ich hier umgehend Abhilfe geschaffen und mir dieses Auto \u2013 Ladeger\u00e4t gekauft. Bei den sommerlichen Temperaturen m\u00f6chte ich nicht wirklich dauerhaft eine Powerbank im Auto liegen haben. Einfach Stecker in den Zigarettenanz\u00fcnder und das Smartphone, und das gute St\u00fcck wird recht fix geladen. Die Verarbeitung ist ausgesprochen gut und wertig, die Stecker sitzen hervorragend, dazu gibt es eine kleine aber feine Schachtel welche zwar zum Versand bestimmt ist, aber wunderbar auch zur dauerhaften Aufbewahrung dienen kann.Auf diese Weise kann man nat\u00fcrlich auch ganz bequem auf der Fahrt zum n\u00e4chsten Termin das Smartphone aufladen. Die Bandbreite f\u00fcr welche Modelle dieses Ladeger\u00e4t geeignet ist, wird vom Hersteller wie folgt angegeben:IPhone 13/13 Pro/13 Pro Max/13 Mini/12 Mini/12/12 Pro/12 Pro Max/ SE 2020 / 11 / 11 Pro / 11 Pro Max / XS / XS Max / X /XR / 8 / 8 Plus / 7 / 7 Plus / 6s / 6s Plus / 6 / 6 Plus / 5s / 5c / 5, iPad (7th/6th/5th/4th Generation) / iPad Air / Air 2/ Air 3, iPad mini 5 / mini 4 / mini 3 / mini 2 / mini, iPad Pro 12.9\" (Gen1) / 12.9\" (Gen2) / 10.5\" / 9.7\", IPod nano (7th generation)/ iPod touch (5th/6th/7th Generation), Huawei, Samsung Galaxy, Note, Nexus, HTC, Sony, LG, Tablet, Powerbank und weiteren.Also bei meinem Modell 7 plus hat es tats\u00e4chlich einwandfrei gepasst und wunderbar geladen. Eine tolle Reserve, die jeder im Handschuhfach liegen haben sollte.",
