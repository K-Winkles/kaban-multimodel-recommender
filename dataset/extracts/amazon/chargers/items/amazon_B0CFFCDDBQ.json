They also do not carry a purse, so they never have a battery pack with them. These little cords are fantastic! I can hand them my beloved charger and one of these cables and they can recharge their devices. Nobody needs 3' of charger cable for that. I can also use this cable and recharge my battery bank at my desk without worrying about cable management. It manages itself. So far, so good, no complaints. Super handy - and cute!",
