With no use of my fingers, the angle is much easier for me to \u201cmash\u201d into the iPad or iPhone. IYKYK \ud83d\ude02 The length is great for reaching across the bed. It is also FAST charging! \u2026. even great for charging iPads that often seem to take more power. This cord lasts longer than any other cord I\u2019ve tried.

I had always had the problem with the weird twisty cable thing and the sometimes when you pull you gotta replug it as well to make it charge but I still like it. Though this one I got not too long ago and it twisted hard a couple days after I got it. Look at the picture, can\u2019t unfold it and it still works so I guess it\u2019s still good.Update : it\u2019s June 14th and this cable no longer works correctly, it lasted 83 days and I assumed it stopped working because of how bendy it is \ud83e\udd7a.",

This is the first time I\u2019ve used the 90 Degree elbow design, but it appears to be the way to go for less chances for problems as bending on connection or strain on cords and tips after plugging in to charge.So far I\u2019ve only iPad got a charge from it, and allls well at this point. Price was good! Surprisingly they were shipped very fast which for me hasn\u2019t happed for a while on Amazon\ud83d\ude09Thanks for handling this purchase so quickly and I will shop with you again for my Apple needs.
