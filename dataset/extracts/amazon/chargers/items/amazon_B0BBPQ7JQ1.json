I didn\u2019t want a million cords to keep up with and this is the perfect solution. It\u2019s sturdy and long (hehe ;) and doesn't get tangled. I\u2019ve had similar cords stop working one cord tip at a time within a few weeks of use. The biggest downside for me is the lights on each cable great for a night light but they are so bright they wake me up. So I have to cover them up at night. This will allow me to know when one of them stops working BUT I can't stand more lights in my bedroom at night.",

I bring one with me to work, where it has the length to reach a floor level socket and charge anybody's phone sitting on the top of the desk. It's quite durable and has small lights on each charger-end to help you find it in the dark. I most often use it to charge my phone, a battery pack, and my wife's phone overnight.

                "reviewText": "5 out of 5 Stars (5)\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50[TL;DR][QUALITY] (5/5)[VALUE] (5/5)[EASE OF USE] (5/5)[MET EXPECTATIONS] (5/5)[PACKAGING] (5/5)[REVIEW REMARKS]This is a 10ft braided cable with four (4) colour-coded ends (1x USB-C, 2x Lightning, 1x MicroUSB). Each end has a little green LED to indicate when power is present. These cables are durable and very flexible. Great for the office or travel.These charging cables are super handy. I ordered these for the length. My other cables, similar design but different manufacturer, are 4ft and I needed something with a little more stretch.At the time of ordering, these cables were $25.99 ($13.00/cable) and for me, this is a terrific deal. The power is consistent and they charge my USB-C phone quickly. The braided design is always a premium feature for me when it comes to cables.I highly recommend these cables, in part because of the colour-coded ends. This makes the input destination easier to identify, especially if you have vision issues, but recognizing colours is not an issue. I like to be able to see what cable is in use at a glance. Super handy and thoughtful. it is also a step in the right direction from an accessibility standpoint.I did not experience anything negative during my review period.I would order these again, maybe in a different size, but with the same design. These are top-shelf quality and they are not overly expensive. I recommend these for anyone looking for CHARGING cables, only the IOS Lightning cables do data and charge simultaneously. For me, that is not an issue as I do not have any functioning IOS products.In the event that experiences change or evolve, updates may be made to this review to address such developments.",
