                "reviewText": "I tested this charger on my iPhone 14 Pro, and it charges at the same speed as apple's branded 12w charger. So it's faster than the old slow 5w charger, but it's not as fast as the 20w+ fast chargers. It's a good balance of speed and heat control. On my iPhone 14 Pro, it got to 40% after 30 minutes and 76% after 1 hour. This is plenty fast for a slower charger. The phone wasn't noticeably warm like with fast chargers either, which degrades battery health. I did not test charging two devices at once.",
