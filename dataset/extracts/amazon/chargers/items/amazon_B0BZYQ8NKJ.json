I was thrilled when I found this set of chargers on Amazon! They arrived within 24 hours and were packaged very nicely. They came with an attractive carrying pouch which was a real bonus. I started using them immediately and have found them to be of good quality and give a fast charge. This is really important to me, because I often forget to put my phone on the charger! I was really grateful for the super long cords which give me easy access from across the room. I\u2019m very satisfied with the chargers and will be ordering from them again. My daughter saw mine and plans to buy a set, too. Thanks for a quality product at an affordable price!",
