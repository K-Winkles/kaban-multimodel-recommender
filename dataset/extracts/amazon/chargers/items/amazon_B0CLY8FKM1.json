                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Iwalk Battery for iPhone from Amazon, hoping to find a reliable portable charger for my iPhone. However, my experience with this product has been quite disappointing. First and foremost, the charging time for the battery is excessively long. It takes significantly longer than I expected to fully charge the battery, which is not ideal when you're in need of a quick power boost on the go. This aspect alone makes it inconvenient and inefficient for my needs. Furthermore, the battery's capacity is severely lacking. Despite its promises, the Iwalk Battery only managed to charge my iPhone up to a mere 25 percent before the charger itself died out. This limited charging capability renders the battery practically useless for extended periods away from a power source. Considering these issues, I cannot recommend the Iwalk Battery for iPhone. Its slow charging speed and insufficient capacity make it an unreliable choice for anyone looking to keep their iPhone powered throughout the day. I regret this purchase and will be seeking an alternative solution that better meets my needs. Please note that this review is based on my personal experience and may not reflect the performance of the product in every situation. However, I believe it's important to share my honest feedback to help others make informed decisions.Disappointed customer",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this because I am a college student and needed a portable charger. My phone tends to die while I'm on campus and I sometimes can't find an outlet. The portable charger came quickly and was well packaged in pristine condition. It was easy to set up and plug in to charge. The portable charger does not include an adapter, it just comes with the usb charger chord and portable charger. I was on my phone while I had the fully charged portable charger plugged into it, and it didn't seem to charge my phone quickly. When I left the phone the phone to charge without me being on it, it still seemed to take a long time to charge. When the portable charger was plugged in, it felt wobbly and not well secured within the charging port of my phone almost like it could slip out. Also, when lying flat, the portable charger is thicker than my phone and caused the phone to lay at an angle not flat. I felt that is put some pressure on the portable charger's insert that goes into the charging port of my phone. I ended up returning this item as I want something with greater charger power for both my phone and MacBook computer. Although I've decided to return it, it is a wonderful size that is compact and easy to travel with, to and from campus.",
