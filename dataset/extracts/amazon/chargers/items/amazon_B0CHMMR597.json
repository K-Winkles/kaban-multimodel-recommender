                "reviewText": "After receiving this charger,I have used it for a while.Its charging speed is indeed fast,the overall sense of use is not bad,and the connecting computer is used to transmit files smoothly.This iPhone fast charger has Apple's MFI certification.The general Type-C interface can be used to charge my iPhone 15,or it can also charge Android phones.The compatibility and security are excellent.The length of the cable is 6ft.I like it very much because I am used to lying on the bed to play with my iPhone.The length of 6ft is just right.It can be seen that the material of the charge block and the charge cable is relatively durable,and it is no problem if you accidentally fall a few times.The most important point is that it is affordable and cheap.The two sets of fast chargers are suitable for use in daily lift or emergency use.If necessary,I will buy it again!",

Great!Worth the money!",
