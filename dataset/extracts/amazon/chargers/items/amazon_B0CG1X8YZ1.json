                "reviewText": "I bought this to keep in the car for my OnePlus 9, which charges incredibly fast when using a proper cable and power supply. Using AccuBattery app, the OEM charger usually peaks around 40W, to charge the phone in about 40 min. Most \"fast chargers\" that I've used have come nowhere close to this, usually peaking around 20W. I am happy to report that this charger in the car typically hits in the high 30's W, charging my phone incredibly fast.I haven't tested with other devices, though I'd be interested to do more tests with other devices, such as my wife's iPhone, Steam Deck, Laptop, etc.Very pleased with this charger, I'm buying another to keep in the other car. Great charger, great price, I'm happy.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because I wanted a FLUSH fitting adapter, NOT one that sticks out 1/2\u201d or more. I bought two of these. These are WAY too long for both my 2002 Chevy truck and my 2020 Volvo. So, for both old American and New European they are just too long. Why advertise these as flush fit when they are too long for most standard 12v outlets? As info, for those who care, this is well over 2\" long and you'll want one that is about 1.7\" long if you TRULY want a flush fit. These shorter ones are available on Amazon, like the ones I just bought to replace these (Amazon ASIN B0BBZ64F1C) that I am returning - just make sure to double check the length before you buy!",
