Two came in the pack so the one is on a floor surge protector, standing up so it seemed fine until i brought one down here today and it didn't charge. It drove me crazy looking to the wall plug, think its not fully connected somewhere. Then i was just gonna unplug it to to take to a different outlet.. it has such thin prongs, they didn't even connect on the side if a extension cord. So i came to another one I have in the kitchen. This, in the video, is the best connection of the 2. Sorry its hard to understand what I'm saying in the video. Im from Philadelphia so i hardly speak a language at all. No one understands me. Idk what i said either or id translate . Something about, \"Its not good so its definitely not fast if it cant make contact\". The cord itself feels better made but unfortunately this is my only non usb block. My mom has one but i know its the best kind, like 40$ from her provider. Thats not a good match with this. For the price, its nice to have the cords but they are usually the first to go anyway. Thats actually why im looking for a new one.",
