Definitely works very well for my everyday life. Next it comes in a five pack, so they are really good quality and they last a long time. Last time I bought these I could only find a three pack. So I had one in my room, one in my car, and then my friend took one. I decided to get more because they are good quality and at a good price. By good quality, I mean I have shut my car door on the one multiple times and it still works and there\u2019s no crack in it. And also the one in my room my cats sometimes will claw or not on and they have not damaged through it yet. They charge pretty quickly, but also that depends on the block and outlet that you plugged into as well. One thing I would say is, it would be really cool if we could get them in different colors. I\u2019m glad that they\u2019re white but some people like black or gray or even red and blue. Just a thought\u2026",

                "reviewText": "I buy these a LOT because people take them, my kids and husband take them and lose them, and they are all over our house because they are well made and very durable. My husband, kids and I have them by our beds because they reach so far and you can charge and browse or read at the same time. They charge our iPhone 11\u2019s very fast (we keep phones for a while - writing this as the iPhone 15 is coming out, apparently they changed the plugs on those so these aren\u2019t compatible with them. Boooo Apple!) even while using the phone (unless it\u2019s live streaming or video, but it still charges slowly). They are pretty tough because my kids jerk the cords out of their phones and yet, they haven\u2019t come apart where the connection and the wires meet like most cheap chargers. They fit perfectly and tight into the wall and the phone port, even on my husband\u2019s which is very loose to point some other chargers won\u2019t work. I wish they made the power box (wall plug) too. Those are hard to find a good one that lasts or even works! But I digress\u2026They work great on road trips if you only have a plug/USB port in the front of the vehicle and need one for the backseats (dare I say even 3rd row but not a lot of slack) because they reach far. At airports, it\u2019s nice to not have to sit in a 2\u2019 proximity to an outlet. On airplanes it\u2019s nice to have room to move or be able to use the new phone holders on the top back of the seat while the USB is on the bottom of the seats (?!?!). On the flip side, it can get tangled and annoying to step over in such a small space but overall worth it, I think! I roll the excess and tuck it into the pocket of the seat in front of me.It rolls up tight and easy to stash in my pocket, purse, or backpack outer pockets. Very happy with them and will keep buying them as long as we have a compatible phone and people keep acquiring or losing them.",
