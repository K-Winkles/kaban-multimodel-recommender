                "reviewText": "I bought this charger to replace an Anker PowerPort Atom PD 4, and it's a huge upgrade in every way for my needs (specifically charging a 14-inch/67W MacBook Pro, an iPhone 13 Pro, and a JUUL vaporizer).The old charger worked great, but it wasn't perfect.For starters, it was about twice as wide and deep as the 735, which made me less likely to bring it with me it situations where I really should have, and when I did I could definitely notice the weight difference.The 735 would fit in a jeans pocket; in a sweatpants pocket comfortably; in a cargo pocket unnoticeably; and of course in a clutch, purse, or other bag. The foldable prongs make it really easy to pack. I'll probably bring one of these in my pocket with one of their 4-inch Lightning cables for music festivals for peace of mind.Another gripe with the old charger was the detachable cable from the adapter brick to the AC wall plug. This cable provided more range, but it got tangled and frequently came loose. This cable had to be removed when packing up the charger, since otherwise it would stick out awkwardly and add an inch to the power brick's already considerable length. This all meant I had to constantly untangle and re-coil the cables when traveling. I came to the conclusion that I'd much rather have the charger be near the outlet and choose the appropriate cable length myself, rather than wrestle with two cables all the time.The 735 solves this problem wonderfully. It does stick out somewhat far from the wall (2.6 inches) so measure the gap first if you plan to use it in a tight space. It is nonetheless surprisingly compact for the wattage it can output.My final issue with the old charger was much more niche. I regrettably use a Juul vaporizer, which charges via a magnetic cradle that plugs directly into a USB-A port, forming an \"L\" shape with the taller part of the L being the vaporizer itself. Unfortunately, the USB-A ports on the old charger were oriented so that the vaporizer obstructed the other ports on the charger when plugged in, meaning I had to remove all the cables whenever I wanted to charge the vaporizer and replace them when it was finished.Luckily, the 735 has no such issue, as the USB-A port is oriented so that the vaporizer points away from the other points when charging. This allows me to charge my 3 primary battery-powered devices in something the size of a box of Tic-Tacs, and I couldn't be more pleased.The 735 only supports 1x65W or 45W/20W USB-C charging, which is less than the old charger's 1x100W/2x50W. My most power-hungry device is the MacBook Pro, which ships with a 67W power adapter but uses between 5-40W in real-world benchmarks, and the 735 is able to charge it even when in 45W mode when using the other USB-C port to fast-charge the iPhone. The remaining 12W assigned to the USB-A port is more than enough to charge the vaporizer while all this is happening.To conclude this bloviating review, the 735 is a compact and powerful Swiss Army knife USB charger. Always do your research on the reported and actual power consumption of your devices before you buy anything USB-related.",

                "reviewText": "I have a house full of Anker chargers, and just bought my second one of these.With PD and fast charge compatibility, it has enough power to charge a computer if you use the right cables. Power is shared when you use more than one port at the same time.Besides the high power, the best thing about this charger is its size. It is very compact with a folding plug, and plugs directly into the wall, yet it doesn't get too hot. It comes with a silicone rubber stabilizer to keep it steady in looser wall sockets, but the stabilizer will likely block access to the second outlet.My newest one is going in my backpack to replace a much larger device.The 3 ports allow you to charge multiple devices at once, though it shares the wattage among the devices and may charge slower with multiple devices connected. (40W-12W-12W max with 3 devices connected)It is a bit funky when using an Apple Watch charging cable with others... Read the instructions for plugging and unplugging the cable if you plan to use one.Also, be aware that all USB-C cables are not the same. If you plan to do any high-powered or fast charging, get the proper USC-C to USB-C cable intended for the job. Look for PD or fast charging compatibility. If it isn't working as expected, you should suspect the cables first.",
