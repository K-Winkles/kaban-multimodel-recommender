Plus you can still plug into it! I have a Ford Explorer and it's a little tight getting it in the center counsel cubby but it works great and charges super fast. Will be buying more for our other vehicles!",

                "reviewText": "This came very quickly in the mail and was just as described. There are two different connections to choose from whether you have an iPhone and need a lightning adapter or an Android with a USB C connection, both are available. I love the fact that the cords retract back into the charger when not being used. I get so tired of all the cords hanging down from a traditional car charger. This design keeps everything nice and neat. In addition to the two retractable cables, the unit also has two additional USB ports in case you have other items you would like to charge. I highly recommend this charger. I will never go back to the traditional car chargers as this is a perfect fit for any phone type we need to charge, and it keeps my front dashboard from looking like I had cables running all over the place.",

It\u2019s not as fast as I would have liked or thought but ABSOLUTELY serves its purpose. I love that I am not having to leave loose cords in my car. The cords are also long enough to reach the back seat of my hatchback. Highly recommend, especially for neat freaks.",

We probably would have returned them anyway because they are much bigger and bulkier than we had anticipated. I can't comment on whether they work or not or any of the other details because we never got that far. We ended up having to return the two that we bought. However, I do stand by my thought that this is a great concept.",
