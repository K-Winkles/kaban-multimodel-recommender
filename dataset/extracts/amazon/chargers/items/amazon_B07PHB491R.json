But these chargers genuinely don\u2019t do either. 6 months in and they all still work, no damage to the connectors on the chargers, no damage to the cord. Charges quick and is secure in usb outlets-very durable and sturdy. Also for braided cords they\u2019re ultra flexible (not stiff). I know your probably gonna jump to the bad reviews but I promise you these are worth it. Don\u2019t second guess it these are probably the highest quality iPhone chargers I\u2019ve purchased at their price point and compete with way higher end choices. I\u2019ll update this in a year and tell you if they\u2019re still going. I\u2019m 99% sure they will be. Thanks for the quality chargers seller. I\u2019ll be sure to recommend these to anyone who needs good iPhone chargers.",

                "reviewText": "The cords are clearly cheap both in price and in quality. They are similar to any other generic iPhone cords you\u2019ll find in the market. If you want ones to last longer get yourself a real iPhone cord. If you just need some just in case or to replace something that broke, these are perfect. The actual cord part has stood up well on two of the cords that I have used-the issue has come in with the metal part that you actually put into the phone. I am one of those people that plug and unplug my phone numerous times throughout the day. Probably 6-8 times since I seemingly live on my phone. Bc of that the metal part just fell out of the plastic and was no longer usable after two weeks. Enter the next cord. It\u2019s still usable but a little piece that surrounds the metal on the end has fallen off of it\u2014three days after beginning to use it. The other cord hasn\u2019t been used yet so no word on that one ;) So overall, these are cheap replacement cords which do the job. They charge my phone rather quickly and have given me peace of mind that I won\u2019t have to run out to find a replacement at 2 in the morning. If you\u2019re someone who is a little rough with plugging and unplugging your phone you may be disappointed. But take into consideration that this is 10$ for three cords. If you go into a gas station or Walgreens you\u2019ll find similar cords selling from 15-20$ for one! So this is a good deal and will serve you just fine for its intended purpose.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this iPhone Charger as a replacement for my previous one, mainly attracted to the longer length. While the longer cord was convenient, the overall performance left me with mixed feelings.On the positive side, the length of the cord was exactly what I needed for added flexibility. However, the charging speed was disappointingly slow compared to my previous charger. It took noticeably longer to charge my iPhone, and that was a drawback for me, especially when I needed a quick top-up.The major downside came with durability. Out of the three cords that came with the package, two stopped working after only a couple of months of use. I understand that these chargers were budget-friendly, but the quality didn't meet my expectations. It's disheartening to have to replace cords so frequently.In conclusion, if you're in need of a longer cord and don't mind a slower charging speed, this might work for you. However, be prepared for potential durability issues, especially if you rely on your charger daily. It's an okay option for the price, but I'd recommend exploring other alternatives if you're looking for longevity and faster charging.",
