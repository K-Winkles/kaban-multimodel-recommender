For me, that's no problem - on my desk, I plug into a USB plug on my desk; and I just use a plug I already had, in my bedroom. I think these are the best deal for the money on Amazon. I recommend!",

We also will not have to keep transferring cables from one room to another. All of that means the cables will last longer and not have the fire risks associated with cables cracking and shorting out due to abuse or overhandling. So far, these cables are working properly and not getting heated like some longer cables we've had in the past. Charging rate is about the same as our original iPad USB to Lighting cables, which is excellent. Hope they last a long time!",
