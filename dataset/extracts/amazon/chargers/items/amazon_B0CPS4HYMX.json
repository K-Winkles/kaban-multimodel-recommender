Over the years I have purchased several cords made by other manufacturers and found they were made of cheaper materials than Apple used. Then I found these! They are the perfect length to allow me to use my devices while they charge or to place them on my desk or workstation anywhere I want. The covered cord has a guard over the piece that I connect to my devices, unlike other manufacturers to prevent breaks at the connection. The covered cord is flexible so that I don\u2019t have to worry about it getting pinched or frayed. The fact that we get three cords is the icing on the cake! I can keep one at work and have one to take when traveling and at an incredible price! If you\u2019re tired of buying cords, and want cords that are durable and reliable! These are for you!",

We weren\u2019t sure if they would work with our phones because we\u2019ve had lots of issues finding suitable chargers (iPhones) but these worked great. I bought these thinking it was a 2 pack and was pleasantly surprised to see I had misread and it came with 3. The cords are very long and well made. We have one at the couch and one in each of our vehicles.",
