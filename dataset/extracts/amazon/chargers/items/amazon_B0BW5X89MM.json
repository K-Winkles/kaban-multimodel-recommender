Its fine because I can use them in my house. But I should have paid more attention when purchasing. They work perfectly fine but next time I'll make sure its a regular USB on the one end of the cord.",

                "reviewText": "I've got to say, this iPhone Fast Charger 3 Pack has been a total game-changer for me. Finally, a charger that lives up to the \"fast\" in its name! As an Apple user, having that MFi certification is a must for me, and this set ticks that box. The 20W power delivery is no joke \u2013 it juices up my iPhone at lightning speed, which is a game-changer, especially when I'm in a rush.The fact that it comes in a pack of three is super convenient. I've got one in the bedroom, one in the living room, and another in my bag for on-the-go charging. No more searching for a charger when my battery is running low \u2013 these are strategically placed throughout my day-to-day life.The build quality is solid, and they don't feel like they'll fall apart after a few months of use. The USB-C connection is sturdy, and I haven't experienced any connectivity issues. The three-pack also makes it a great value for the price, considering the quality and fast-charging capability.One thing to note is that the charging cable could be a bit longer, but that's a minor gripe. If you're sitting close to an outlet, it's perfect, but for those times when you need a bit more reach, an extra foot would have been nice.",

I never snagged or pulled the cable, no water damage, outlets are grounded. I tested the cable on other charging devices but no luck. Now I have one cable left and two wall adapters that still work excellent. I would recommend the product as I believe I may have just gotten a faulty cable, idk.",

As a result, the charger only lasted for a few months which was surprising because you think it would have been more durable. I have had this charger now for several months, same outlet but so far no problems. I ordered two and will order more to have on hand. I highly recommend this charger.",

If this is the case, just make sure your phone is charging and it won't be a big deal. Kinda annoying tho",
