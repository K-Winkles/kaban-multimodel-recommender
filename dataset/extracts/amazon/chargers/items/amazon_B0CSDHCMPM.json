                "reviewText": "I am a road warrior for both work and personal travel. I recently added Airpod Pros and an Apple Watch SE 2nd gen to my Apple collection which includes an iPhone 13Mini. This charges fits my needs to a \"T\".Build quality is very good. It should be noted that I purchased the charger thinking that it did not include an actual charger adapter wall \"box\" but to my pleasant surprise it was included along with a USB-C cable.All three devices charge quickly as expected.The best part about this charger is its foldability and compact size. Although robustly built, it folds up to a very portable size that is very travellable. Very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I couldn\u2019t give it five stars but there\u2019s a caveat. It might not be the device, it might be my device. Maybe. Unsure.I am still using and iPhone X (at least until I get my hands on the iPhone 15) with a thin, clear plastic case. Generally I have no issues with magnetic chargers with my iPhone X. This particular charger seems to charge slowly and make my iPhone X get warm. Is it the quality of the charger or is it that my iPhone X is actually too old and not officially supported? Maybe. The jury\u2019s out until I get my iPhone 15. It charges my Apple Watch 7 just fine and it charges my AirPods Pro (1st generation) just fine. For all three items I have noticed that one must be careful to place the items exactly correctly, otherwise the charge will discontinue before finishing the job. But it works. The Apple Watch obviously needs to get a good magnetic connection to the charging disc otherwise it will not charge. For the AirPods Pro and the iPhone it should not be required to place with millimeter precision, just \u201ccentered\u201d.I find it hard to judge this one. Maybe it\u2019s not great but great for the price. Would I buy it again? No, but only because I would want to try another brand if for no other reason than to compare and contrast.",
