One of the big gripes I have about the Samsung charger is the length of the cord -- it's just too short. I saw good reviews about this after market cord and particularly liked that it had a longer cord. So far, it's worked great. It charges fast and the longer cord has been great, especially when traveling and outlets are farther away from the bed or couch.",
