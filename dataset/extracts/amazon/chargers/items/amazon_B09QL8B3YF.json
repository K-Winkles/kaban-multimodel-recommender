                "reviewText": "These usbc lightning cables are exactly what I needed,and work very well.Not only bulletproof but in my new Maverick used in the usbc data charger port they perform and deliver unlike any other.This is the fiveth one I have.purchased through Amazon,I was not compensated in any way for this review.I have been buying these brand iphone cables many times - always finding them to be an Apple MFi certified,more affordable alternative to Apple brand cords.They have always held up well- certainly longer than the brand ones.I love the thickness of the cords,make me feel secure that overtime they won't get \"turtle neck\" or break from bending as the apple ones do. I timed it and my iphone went from 0 to 50% in 25 minutes. I don't know if that is extraordinarily good but it is pretty good for me.Updated on 3 October 2022:I have to say that this is one of the best purchases I have ever made. The product itself is first-rate for the money.I've been using them for more than half a year,they are still efficient,charging very fast,and they have kept them shape perfectly,feel very smooth and never get kinky or lumpy.Some other reviews said that these usb c to lightning cables charge slowly,not support PD fast charging, I think maybe they don't use 20W or above adapter.the product listing says these cables need to usb 20W or above USB-C Power Adapter to achieve power delivery fast charging.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the USB C Charging Cord, and while it's a decent cable, the quality is just alright.On the positive side, the cable is Apple MFi certified, which ensures that it is compatible with all of my Apple devices. The 6FT length is also great for charging my devices while using them, and the 3-pack ensures that I always have a spare cable on hand.However, I did notice that the cable's quality is just average. The cable feels a bit flimsy and not as sturdy as some of the other charging cables I've used before. The charging speed is also not as fast as I would have liked, which can be frustrating when I'm in a hurry.Overall, while the USB C to Lightning Cable is a decent option for charging my iPhone, it's not the highest quality cable out there.",
