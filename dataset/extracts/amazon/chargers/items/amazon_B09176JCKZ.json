                "reviewText": "At 9oz it's heavier than most phones and nearly an inch thick it feels bulky, but this is offset by the smooth, rounded edges and corners, so it feels comfortable in the hand. Build quality is very good, almost on par with Anker batteries, my biggest concern is the hard/clear plastic display; it flexes just a hair on the long display side and I don't know if it'll survive a hard smack or drop. (i've dropped my anker battery packs without any issues).My biggest love is the speed it'll recharge my GS21 and my son's iphone 13 (at the same time) and how quickly it'll recharge when plugged in. and i do like the display; helps dissipate 'battery anxiety'.The 'kickstand' is kinda nifty, but i fully expect that to break/fail...but it does work.",

It works great to keep the battery level. It doesn't charge while in use, at least when using USB-C to USB-C. It adds about 3 hours, but I didn't time it exactly. I used this combined with the cable \"SUNGUY USB C to USB C Cable 1FT\" and had no problems if anyone else is looking to use this with a Quest 3.",

She even charges two devices at the same time. It does state three at once but, she has only tried two and it worked great.It's lightweight and can fit in most pockets in your pants, coats, or bags. In today's world of gadgets and gizmo's it's almost crucial to have a backup charger.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this little power bank for over a week now and it sure is impressive.In the package you get the power bank, some instructions and warranty, a usb-a to usb-c cable and a carrying case.Design and esthetics:The design of the INIU power bank is well thought out. The rounded corners makes it more comfortable to hold and the textured surface material adds more grip in your hands. The power capacity indicator is also very neat with leds that indicates the battery percentage and the charging status. The size of the power bank is also quite small which make it more portable. As a bonus, the power bank even has a retractable stand to put you phone on.Performance:Despite it's small size, the INIU power bank features a nice 10000mah battery capacity which is enough to charge my Galaxy S10+ 3 times. An excellent feature is the 22.5W fast charging that works with both android and IPhone. This feature makes the usage of the power bank much more convenient. Speaking of convenience, the INIU power bank has 3 ports, 2 usb-a for output and one usb-c for output and input. Using my 18w samsung charger, I am able to fill up in about an hour and a half. Value: the price of the INIU power bank makes it a real bargain, it's well built and supports fast charging. For it's price, the device feels and looks very premium and sports useful features like fast charging and a integrated phone stand.Overall, I give the INIU power bank a solid recommendation.",
