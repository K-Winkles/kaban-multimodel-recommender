                "reviewText": "A few months ago, we lost our electricity for a number of hours. Although we have USB powered lights and lamps, they had all lost their power from sitting. So, we had to resort to candles and headlamps for lighting. After that experience, I decided to buy a couple power banks to be prepared if this should happen again. This power bank takes quite a while to fully charge because of the high capacity.This power bank is one of my favorites for a number of reasons.1) It has a capacity of 25,800 mAh that lasts a long time when powering USB lighting.2) I fully charged this power bank 6 months ago and intentionally didn't use it after that to see how long the charge would last. As you can see from one of my pictures, the power bank still had over half of the maximum power which would amount to about over 13,000 mAh. This is still more than the capacity of many power banks.3) This power bank is smaller than most phones, and weight only slightly more than a phone. So, it could easily be kept handy in a purse.4) It has two USB output ports so two devices can be charge at one time.5) The lights on the top of the power bank tell you how much charge is left.Overall, I like this power bank more than some of the others I bought because of the amount of power it holds and the amount of time it holds power (over 6 months).I hope this review was helpful for you.",

My wife has one in her purse and I currently use mine on my watch. I can use it to recharge my watch up to 15 times before recharging it. On phones it might help up to 3 times. For the price and convenience, it is very useful. Mine is about 3 years old and my wife's is about 3 months old.",

This battery has been able to charge 2 Arlo Pro4 cameras on a single charge from somewhere around 20% (the cameras not the portable battery) it does take a little while to recharge the battery itself but for what I'm using it for I can live with that. I've got enough backups and found some extra long cables here to make it easier to use this to charge my cameras rather than pull my cameras down every time they needed to be recharged",

I plugged the USB in and yes 24 hours passed and it still was not charged. The problem was I did not insert the USB properly into the charger. The moment I fixed the problem, it charged in no time. I realize that it is heavy but I also realize that it can charge more that just a cellphone and that it maybe needed to be able to keep a charge for a period of time. I will reviev again after six months or so.",
