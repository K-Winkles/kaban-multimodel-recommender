                "reviewText": "Got this to use in my car. I liked the idea that it was coiled and not flopping all over the dashboard. This one came in the mail and fairly quickly. It's kinda short and the coil is tight. So I can put my phone close to the charger, but it won't allow me to move the phone around much. Maybe it will loosen up with us. The durability seems good - I just bought this. We will see. Big hopes for a small cord in the future.",

                "reviewText": "Got these new cables for a few projects around the hose that use the USB connectors. I like the way the coiled cables react and allow for different lengths. The connectors have a very good quality and work well, as good or better than the original cables, and keep things neat and flexible.",
