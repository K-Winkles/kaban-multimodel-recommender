                "reviewText": "Approximately eight months ago, I acquired the JARGOU wireless charger and it has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance and versatility. The package included the charger itself, power cables, and straightforward instructions. While the instructions were basic, I would like to emphasize that the charger's capabilities extend far beyond the simplicity of its initial setup.This all-in-one charging station has proven to be universally compatible, accommodating phones, AirPods, and smartwatches that support wireless charging functionality. In comparison to other models I have previously owned, the charging speed is notably swift, efficiently supporting all my devices.I have integrated this charging unit into my office setup, and its performance has not only met but exceeded my expectations. Moreover, it has garnered positive feedback from my colleagues who, on occasion, have utilized the charger for their own devices. The charger seamlessly caters to both Android and Apple devices, making it a versatile and convenient solution for all users.Satisfied with its performance, I intend to purchase two additional units for my wife and daughter. In light of my positive experience, I wholeheartedly recommend this wireless charging option to anyone seeking a reliable and efficient solution for both home and office use.",

But what I like most about it is its simplicity. The three charging stations are right there in front with a slight backward slant to keep everything in place and visible and at the bottom are lights to indicate status of charging. In the pyramidal box is just one piece and a cord and power adapter. Here I have it setup on my desk beside a laptop. The second photo shows just what is compatible with it on a removal cellophane label so expectations are set. A bonus is its clean look and absence of additional wire clutter. If you have compatible devices and want an attractive and useful 3-way charger, I don't think you can go wrong with this.",

The charge works fine through my phone case, although the AirPods rarely charge through the rubber case. My guess is that most people don't put their AirPods in a case.My biggest complaint is the lack of magnet in the charger. Because of this, it is very easy to think you lined up your phone and then wake up the next morning to find out you were off by just a little bit. I have learned to triple check the little light at the bottom at night, but there were several nights the first month when my phone, AirPods, or both were not charged because I did not perfectly line them up.Overall works great and I would recommend. Adding a magnet for alignment would make this five stars.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased at least four charging stations from different companies over the last couple of years. I use them when traveling in addition to placing them in various locations at home. After using each of them I wind up with a list of pros and cons. This is the first charging device that I can't find anything negative to report. Its apparent that the designers put real thought into building a better Charging Station, and I am very pleased with my experience so far. The ONLY little negative that I can think of to say, and this is knit-picking for sure, is that the power cord is shorter than I'd like. I have this device on my nightstand and plugged into the wall behind it. It's long enough, but its close. A longer power cord would be appreciated for sure. By the way, all of the others I own also have shorter power cords.Here are some of the highlights that I love:1. A built-in Apple Watch Charger! No need to use the one that shipped with your watch. This was a welcome surprise, especially since I would have had to buy another one. Great addition, and the only charger I own with this feature.2. No annoying bright green, blue, red lights on this device. Because of this alone, this device immediately moved to my nightstand. I don't want or need LED lighting effects next to my bed in the middle of the night. One of the charging stations I have flashes wildly when the phone is done charging. WHY?? Because they could, but it shows a lack of common sense product development. Instead, this device has 3 subtle green LEDs on the base of the device. One to show the Phone is charging, one for the watch, and one for the airpods. Another very nice touch is that these lights automatically turn off after maybe 20 seconds. So, my nightstand is dark like I like it. Not to worry though, should you have a problem where your device stops charging for some reason, those LEDs will continuously flash to alert you. I have a very thick case on my phone and as such, if I don't place it on the charger correctly, it will flash at me. I correct it, and I'm good to go. Perfect! It's a subtle and very functional feature, especially for a device next to my bed.3. Sturdy, attractive, and well planned design. This device has a solid, quality feel to it, and I really like the attention to detail. For example, there's a subtle, but very appreciated design feature that I haven't seen on any of my other devices. They added rubber under where the phone and airpods charge instead of just the slippery plastic. So the phone sits on top of this rubber and doesn't slide around like my other chargers.To sum it up, I appreciate it when a design is well thought out, and this device corrects all the things that I didn't like about my other devices, and then surprised me with the addition of rubber that the phone and airpods sit on while charging, a great idea on a much improved Charging Station.",

I have tested and compared the charging speed with other charging devices I have and while it is not as fast as using the fast charging USB C cable to charge iPhone directly, it does out perform two other wireless chargers that I have (which I paid more), and without the hassle of cables. The built quality if pretty decent. Make sure to use a fast charging adaptor (also included) for maximum charging speed.",

                "reviewText": "Current Devices:- Apple Watch Series 7 on Watch OS 10.2.- iPhone 12 Pro on iOS 17.2.1- AirPods Pro (A2084)The charging stand looks great, but feels fairly light. The feel of the stand does feel like it will be durable, just the weight does make me concerned... but maybe it being lighter is a good thing?Anyways, the stand is actually pretty useful. For those who have multiple iDevice's and are either in school, work a desk job, or just game/chill on their computer, this is a great gadget to have. There is one annoying thing about it, but whenever I bump/nudge my desk the slightest (could be from shifting my arms for a better typing angle or to grab my mouse), my Apple Watch turns on then off. I'm not sure if this the charger stopping and restarting the charging cycle to the watch, but it's the only device that does this (then again, maybe its a Watch thing?).Aside from that, the stand charges my devices, makes my desk look more organized, and reduces the number of cables I have, so for me it's a win to use this.Now I have used charging stands before in the past that let me down fairly quickly, so hopefully this doesn't repeat, but if all goes well I'll likely buy a second for desk at work. It is sick that it comes with the wall charger though, and an alleged 18W one at that too!Currently, as of January 14, 2024 with 1 full week of daily use, I'd recommend this product.",

Product is accurate as far as looks, the baby blue color is spot on.Definitely serves its purpose well, have had no issues with the charge.Would recommend to anyone looking for a simpler way to charge than running 3 cords.",
