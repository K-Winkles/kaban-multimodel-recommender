                "reviewText": "I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.",
