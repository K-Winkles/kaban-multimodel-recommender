I also like that they came with two different length cables for different uses. The cables themselves are very robust and I expect they will last a very long time. The usb c port charges very quickly. I am very happy with this purchase and I feel you will be as well. The price of these chargers is fantastic. I can believe you can find a better product at any price.",

The chargers quality are sturdy they\u2019re not cheap or easily breakable. I also like the fact that you get two cords that are 6 feet and 10 feet which are good lengths. A you get two charging bricks as well. So you don\u2019t have to run around looking for your charger brick after charging your devices. You\u2019ll always have an extra one available to charge your device. if you choose to share one of the chargers that\u2019s an option too. Customer service is also good if you have any questions in my experience. The cost is very affordable for two very good chargers in my opinion.",

Charges faster than my previous solution and comes as a two pack so less moving things around for me.The charger build quality seems great to me and is very similar to one I have from Apple (at least in look/feel).The charging cords are nice too - a little stiff but I believe that\u2019s just because they were packaged so tightly in the box.Overall I\u2019m very pleased with everything.",
