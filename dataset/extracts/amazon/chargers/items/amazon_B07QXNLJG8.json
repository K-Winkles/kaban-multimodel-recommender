AND I found multiple times when I was traveling I forgot my kindle charger, so I decided to get some of these prior to theirs visit and a busy summer travel season. Worked great to have all the different chargers in one cord. Also added benefit is that you can charge multiple devices with one cord all at once. over all I highly recommend. we now have one of these as a permanent fixture in our kitchen and living room so that people aren't replacing chargers constantly.",
