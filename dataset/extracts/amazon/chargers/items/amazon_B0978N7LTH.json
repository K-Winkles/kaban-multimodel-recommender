                "reviewText": "Oh boy, folks, let me tell you about the magical disappearing act of my iPhone chargers! I bought this 3-pack because, you see, I have two teenage boys, and it's like living in a real-life version of the Bermuda Triangle for chargers.These Apple MFi Certified Lightning Cables are like the Houdini of the cable world. They're the real deal \u2013 six feet of pure, unadulterated charging glory. I tried everything to keep them from vanishing into thin air. I hid them, locked them in a vault, and even labeled them with \"MOM'S CHARGER - HANDS OFF!\" But, alas, my teenage sorcerers still managed to make them disappear.It's like a game of hide and seek that never ends. But hey, at least I know these chargers are up for the challenge. They're tough, durable, and they keep on working their magic, even when they reappear from the abyss of teenage backpacks and mysterious hiding spots.So, if you too have teenage magicians in your house, this 3-pack is your secret weapon. It's like the Energizer Bunny of iPhone chargers \u2013 it keeps going and going, no matter how many times it disappears and reappears. Pure charging wizardry, I tell you!",

They last forever as long as you don\u2019t loose them or break them by accident, they work great!!",
