                "reviewText": "I bought the new iPhone 15 and the charger changed to the c-port. Of course all the chargers we have are for the old iPhones. So I bought these to have extras and I\u2019m disappointed to say the least. They are durable and they charge my phone, yes. However, the box pops up that says the accessory is not compatible and you have to click okay for the box to disappear. Then it will charge your phone. The box will continue to pop up every minute or so! It\u2019s the most annoying thing ever! ALSO, when using the block and the charger I kept getting a pop up that said there was too much power to charge my phone, I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing! But when I used the wall plugs the have the ubc c-port without the box it would charge it, however still will say it\u2019s not compatible. So yes, it charges your phone but you will get constant box pop ups.",
