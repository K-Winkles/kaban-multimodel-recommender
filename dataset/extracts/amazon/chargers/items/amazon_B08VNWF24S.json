Since I threw the box away I didnt even think I could send back or get replacement.But I left a review indicating that it was nothing more than a glorified blue light. The company contacted me via email for refund or replacement and even offered to give me an upgraded version. They didnt have to contact me or offer an upgraded replacement. I thanked them and requested the original version/smaller version I previously purchased to be sent to me since I wanted a smaller less bulky item from the start. They sent it to me. The replacement works fine, does what I need it to do and just glad that my first order was just a dud.Important: I recommend this product because of The Company not the product exactly. They stood by their product and offered solutions if things were damaged.",
