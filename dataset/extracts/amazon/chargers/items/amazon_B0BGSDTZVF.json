                "reviewText": "Move over, Apple-provided charging cord \u2013 there's a new trio in town, and they're like the Avengers of the charging world! I present to you the iPhone Charger 3-Pack: 10 feet of braided magnificence that's not just a charging cable; it's a lifestyle choice.Let's start with the quality \u2013 these cables are so durable, I'm convinced they moonlight as superhero capes when I'm not looking. They've outlasted the Apple-provided cord by months, and I've put them through more twists and turns than a daytime soap opera. If charging cables had a Hall of Fame, these bad boys would be front and center, wearing tiny charging capes.Now, the length \u2013 10 feet of charging freedom! I've got one in the car, one at the office (where my boss thinks I'm working but really just charging my phone), and one in my home office, where I'm the self-appointed CEO of procrastination. No more acrobatics trying to reach an outlet; I can practically charge my phone from the neighbor's house.And the price \u2013 a true steal! I would've willingly forked over $10 for just one of these charging champs, but the universe smiled upon us and said, \"Why settle for one when you can have three?\" It's like a charging cable Black Friday deal that lasts all year round. I'm half-expecting a fireworks display and confetti every time I plug in my phone.In conclusion, if you're still rocking a single charging cable, it's time to step into the future with the iPhone Charger 3-Pack. Quality that outlasts relationships, length that defies spatial limitations, and a price that's practically begging you to treat yourself. Consider my charging game officially upgraded \u2013 one cable for every occasion, and a spare to share with my phone-less friends. 10 feet of freedom, folks \u2013 10 feet!",

The longest chord I could get him at the time was 6 ft, and it barely reached his side table when he was in his chair and he struggled to be able to charge his phone while he was in bed. When I saw these I bought them and I keep a spare one unused in case my Dad ends up back in the hospital (he has a lot of health concerns). I also use one in my office where the outlet is a bit of a stretch from my desk, so this way I can charge my phone and still have it next to me. My Mom also has a tendency to let a bunch of chords get tangled together and often damages phone chords, but so far this one has continued going strong for her. Definitely would recommend these, they are so convenient and work really well.",

However after about 6 months one began to fray, and this has affected connectivity and it sometimes doesn\u2019t work. I didn\u2019t even use it heavily. At least there are backups, but it should last longer than that especially with the light use I subjected it to.",
