                "reviewText": "I really like this charger! I was recently traveling in Europe for 3 weeks and borrowed my father-in-law\u2019s very small power bank. It was small and didn\u2019t weigh much, which made it convenient to use in a variety of circumstances. However, I realized that for future trips I really needed something larger. I am often out for long days at a time, hiking in nature, or on the road exploring, and I want to keep my devices charged for taking pictures and video or using it for navigation. I began to try several ones, and this one is the BEST out of all I have tried. While this one is about 15 ounces in weight it will charge my iPhone at least 4-5x in total before I need to recharge it, which I doubt I will ever need.I really like the circular digital readout that tells how much charge is left. I can just tap the side button, without needing to plug it in, and know immediately. It is easy to read and so far I haven\u2019t drained it to zero. It also charges quite quick and charges my iPhone quick. I also love that it has the option for USB-C, which offers a lot of options for different devices, and sort of \u201cfuture-proofs\u201d this portable charger. It was a good price, and one of the better deals I found while researching.So far this purchase is better than I expected and was everything I wanted in upgrading. I\u2019ll update this review if that changes in the future, but I don\u2019t expect it to.",

                "reviewText": "I have a smaller portable charger from this company, and it is great; I just received this bigger charger and it is also great! It charges devices fast and lasts a long time on a single charge. I charged my phone from 15% to 85% on my lunch break at work (half an hour). I also used the same charge to charge my phone overnight and my son's tablet when we went out: it still has more charge left to give.The only drawback is how bulky and heavy it is. Carrying this in your pocket or small purse would be annoying I would think. But that's so small of an issue compared to how nice this charges and how long it lasts.",

Also I have taken it to work and tried different cords to different phones and computer and it charges all of them really well, it\u2019s very affordable didn\u2019t cost much at all it\u2019s energy efficient. The battery life is amazing it\u2019s still at 91% from 11 o\u2019clock this morning when I unplugged it it is heavy and large but that\u2019s because it\u2019s a real deal and if you drop it, you don\u2019t have to worry about it breaking because it\u2019s made like a truck , I really like this product. My dad has an old farm truck and it doesn\u2019t have anywhere to charge your phone so this is perfect. I actually ordered him one as well. I really appreciate you telling me about the item. It was worth every bit.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this companies 20,000 mAh a few months ago and liked it so much that when I found out they had another version with twice the capacity, I was comfortable buying it from them. It has a very solid build quality and while I don't plan to drop it, it feels like what ever it lands on will suffer more than this battery. This battery has 2 standard USB-A and one USB-C outlets and charges quickly. I like having a portable battery with the capacity to charge my iPad when traveling. Super helpful to have a display providing the charge status of the battery itself. I recommend this battery for anyone looking for a solid, well built travel battery. I also recommend their 20,000 mAh battery if you need a smaller battery that is the size of a cell phone.",
