The cords seem to be very well made so the ends should not break like several others I have used before. The connection to the charger and the phone make a nice secure connection that does not just slip back out like others I have tried. I really like that the charger has both the USB-A and USB-C ports on it that charge various devices very quickly. The 2 different lengths of cords is very useful also. This is a very sturdy set that I really like using and would recommend.",
