Most are quite narrow and would work fine in this, but I bought some USB fairy lights on Amazon and the USB plug is so thick- it fits in the slot provided just fine, but I can't put another one next to it. So the plug only works for ONE USB cord. So examine your USB plug before buying this option - you may not be able to use it for 2 USB cords.",
