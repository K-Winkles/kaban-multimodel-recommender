Then a blocks stops working. I am not sure if there is a kill switch in their or not, but for someone who typically has cords that lasts well OVER 5 YEARS due to how well I take care of my electronics, I\u2019m shocked that both a block and 1 cord no longer fulfill the desired purpose.These are great for charging, and have excellent speed, but don\u2019t expect to get 1-2 years out of them, especially with children or rough environments.Into the trash it goes.",
