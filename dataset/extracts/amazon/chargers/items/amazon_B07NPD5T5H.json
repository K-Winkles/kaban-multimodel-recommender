With Smart-iC Intelligent Technology, it could automatically detect your devices to deliver optimum charging speed: 1) Work with Adaptive Fast Charging (AFC) compatible devices as a fast charger; 2) Work with Quick Charge 3.0/2.0/1.0 (QC 3.0/2.0/1.0) compatible devices as a fast charger; 3) Work with other non-fast USB devices as a standard charger with normal speed. What is the difference between Quick Charge (QC) and Adaptive Fast charging (AFC)? They are basically the same technology but brands marketed in a different names. While Qualcomm named it Quick Charge, Samsung named it Adaptive Fast Charging. Should I worry that the charger gets hot while charging? This AFC technology is to quick charge your phone to 50~60 percent, then turn to the trickle mode. During charging, the charger & phone may get hot, and it will cool down after 60%. Therefore, AFC is actually not used to fully charge a device. How Fast Could It Be? This fast wall charger set compatible with both Quick Charge 3.0 and Adaptive Fast Charging (AFC), enables mobile phone to be 50% charged in 30 mins, 75% faster than conventional chargers.
