Love that they come in different lenghts, the longest one is awesome for the bedside table which is what i wanted, and love that they all have different colors so that we can easily identify who they belong to, they are sturdy and don\u2019t seem flimsy at all like others we've bought in the past, would recomend!",

I just recently started using the purple one (i think it\u2019s 6 ft) it doesn\u2019t work properly. You have to fidget with it and it doesn\u2019t always continue to charge.",

                "reviewText": "I had planned to include pictures with this review but it is rather hard to take a picture of something that has disappeared. Granddaughter, her husband and their three kids visited soon after these arrived. Nosey great-grands found them and promptly confiscated my new cords. They all needed a new charging cord and this left me with only one. But they wanted a spare so there went the last one. They were \u201cdiscussing\u201d (arguing) about who would end up with the longest cord. Oh well, I will just get more. These appeared to be durable enough to stand up to the abuse they will get from those super-active youngsters. And they did seem to like the different colors. All in all they were well pleased with their find.I just figure these made an inexpensive gift for the kids. Maybe I will get 2 sets so I will have plenty to \u201cfind\u201d on a visit later this year. But great set of charger cords at a reasonable price.",
