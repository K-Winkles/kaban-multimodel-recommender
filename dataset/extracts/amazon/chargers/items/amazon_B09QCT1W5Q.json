I put in a request and let the company know that my charges were delivered to the wrong address. They quickly replace my items and ship me out a replacement set of chargers that came very quickly. They are very good at charging and I have no issues with the chargers. If I need to purchase charges again, I will purchase from this company. Thank you for making my purchase easy and not a hassle.",
