                "reviewText": "Do you live with another person, and/or persons? If you do, then I'm sure you have had a conversation (perhaps heated) about whose charger is being used. My household was no different, everyone was asking \"where is my charger?!\", \"Is that MY charger you are using?!\"or \"I left my charger right here and now it's gone!\" so off to amazon I went to stop the madness!The good news, this product put order back into my home. These long braided lightning cables for our iPhones allowed us each to have our own color of charger. After that we could all easily identify our personal chargers from others in the household. It's great that they are also durable, and quickly charge my phone but for me the different colors were a game changer. Order has been restore to my household and I am grateful!",
