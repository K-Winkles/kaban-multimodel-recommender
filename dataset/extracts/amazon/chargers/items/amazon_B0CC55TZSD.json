Pictured is the percent of charge my phone was on and how long it would take to get to 100%. As is with most of these, the charge speed will be significantly slower than a regular, USB-C charger. But that is not something I'm particularly picky about. This served my needs and works well with my S21 Ultra. (NOTE: the green light does turn off -- it lights up when placed on top and again when it reaches 100%)",

But it did...for a few days, THEN I found out that it was recharging my phone WAY too slowly! Example: I took my Samsung A24 phone with 55% battery life and set it on the charging pad. It said, \"3hrs 15min to charge\". I then plugged in the regular Samsung cord to the wall socket and it read, \"1hr 10mins to charge\". You do the math!!",

Just lay it on and it works.I do have a case on my phone, as does my wife, but hers does not always want to charge. Our cases are different, so hers may be on the \"bit thicker\" side and could affect the performance.Personally I think they are great.",
