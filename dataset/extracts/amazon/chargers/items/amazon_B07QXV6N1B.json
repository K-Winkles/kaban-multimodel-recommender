                "reviewText": "I bought this a few months ago as 'emergency backup', if I happened to be away from a charging source (so, not in a building or car; generally for camping and the like). The battery in my Galaxy S8 has degraded over time, and I wasn't ready to get spendy on a new phone, nor did I look forward to 'cell phone surgery' to replace the battery (the days of popping off the case back and swapping out in a minute or two are long gone, sad to say). So I ordered this up. At 10,000 mAh, I figured I should get enough charge to get me through a jam.If you're thinking... \"S8! That's a dinosaur!\" -- you're likely rocking something much more current, and aren't worried about off-grid power. Yet. But remember -- all batteries degrade with time.After having used it... my thoughts- Takes a bit to charge up, once discharged (so once you've discharged, plan ahead). Especially the first time.- However, once it's charged up, the self-discharge rate is slow, so you don't have to constantly keep it plugged into a wall wart, etc. You can charge this up, once conditioned, and pack it away for a few weeks to a few months.- The 4 LED meters on the front are handy for determining SoC / Time to Charge- Form factor on this is very similar to the dimensions on my S8 (although a little thicker, and of course, heavier)- A shorter USB A <> USB-C cable does double duty -- USB A to bring the charge to the phone / device via USB-C, then remove & flip USB-C into the input of the Anker, while plugging the 'A' end into any compatible port to recharge it.- Comes with a black cloth bag with drawstring closure, which is nice to keep that short USB cable together with the device. Nothing fancy, but useful.- And probably the best, after using Qi-Wireless for 90% of the time over the life of the G8 -- this thing puts juice into the phone, quickly. I can go from 5-15% charge to 30% in under 30min. Not sure how many amps it's charging at (rated at 'up to 12' -?), but it's definitely quick. If you're caught somewhere without power (or even if you're not) -- this device is a lifesaver (figuratively & perhaps literally, I guess).Technically, I guess you're not supposed to use the phone while charging with a power bank, but it comes in handy for those times where you need to use the phone a little longer, but need a little juice to tide you over (it juices the phone so fast--especially vs. Qi-wireless--that you say \"I might as well just keep it hooked up to this)). I think it'll charge close to 100% in about 90 minutes, maybe less.- Since my G8 battery is ~ 3800 mAh (?), I can get up to two full charges out of this thing, or many 'partial' charges. From full, 30 minutes' time on the G8 doesn't even remove one 'dot' from the 4-light meter. This is real value, in my book. Because most of the time, I can get back to a power source in 30min or so.So... for what I'm using it for, which is to buy time until I decide to finally (!) upgrade my phone, and keep the S8 running a little while longer... it's an excellent accessory, from a trusted company. Since this has been out a while, and been superseded by higher-cap devices, solar-capable chargers, etc. -- it's also cheap -- about the cost of one of those replacement battery kits (with batteries that came from who knows where).Not often I unequivocally give the full 5-stars... but this product gets them from me. Recommended.(oh, and mine came new in a box, so if yours doesn't... get in touch with Anker for a new replacement)",

                "reviewText": "I recently got my hands on the Anker PowerCore Slim 10000, and it's nothing short of a game-changer! This portable charger lives up to its promises, and then some. The sleek design and premium build quality make it a joy to carry, fitting effortlessly into my pocket without compromising on power.The slim size doesn't compromise on capacity \u2013 with 10,000mAh, it's a powerhouse! I tested it with my iPhone 13, and it delivered a speedy and efficient charge, thanks to Anker's PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology. What impressed me the most was the attention to safety. Anker's MultiProtect system ensured my device was shielded from overcharging, short circuits, and temperature spikes, providing peace of mind during every recharge.The versatility of this charger is another standout feature. The trickle-charging mode is a game-changer for low-power devices, ensuring they get the optimal charge. The inclusion of two input ports is handy, although it's essential to note that they can't be used simultaneously \u2013 a minor trade-off for the overall convenience and reliability this charger offers. Kudos to Anker for including a Micro USB cable, making it ready to go right out of the box.In conclusion, the Anker PowerCore Slim 10000 is a must-have for anyone on the move. It's the perfect blend of style, portability, and power, making it an essential companion for my tech-filled adventures.

Charges my iPhone fairly quick.Good to have while your travelling. I like it.Downside: It has two input ports for charging the actual device itself and only ONE output for charging your personal device like your iPhone/tablet/earphones etc. I personally would rather have one USB port to charge the portable charger itself and then have two output ports for charging multiple devices (ex: your iPhone and Apple Watch at the same time). But that\u2019s my opinion and user feedback. Wireless charging would also be a cool feature to have too. Overall it\u2019s a good compacted portable charger that gets the job done. I also don\u2019t feel like the batter is significantly drained after charging my device(s). I used the portable charger this afternoon to briefly charge my iPhone. I\u2019m currently charging my Apple Watch from approx. 11% to 100% and then about to charge my iPhone again (<20%) and the portable charger looks like it still has a full-charge.",

The convenience factor cannot be overstated, making it a go-to solution for those who are always on the move.While it doesn't support fast charging, the PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technologies deliver a reasonably swift and efficient charge.

The absence of multiple outputs and additional features like a flashlight may be a drawback for some, but for me, the core functionality is what matters most.Despite its limitations, the Anker Power Bank 10000mAh stands out for its reliability, solid build, and overall performance. It may lack some bells and whistles, but for those seeking a straightforward, dependable power solution, this Anker model is a commendable choice. It has certainly earned its place in my tech arsenal, providing a convenient and efficient charging solution on the go.If you have a slightly bigger budget id recommend the 20kmAh Anker portable charger as it can charge multiple devices at has fast charge capabilities. Working in tech it does hold more benefits for myself, however for the average joe I highly recommend this product.",
