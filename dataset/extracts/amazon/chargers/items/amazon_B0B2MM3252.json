Normal plug in adapters did not always transfer the right amount of power to keep the cameras batteries charged 100%. With the 33W, Anker 323 Charger the cameras are always reading full battery without over heating or warping. Highly recommend these chargers but always refer to the owners manual of the device you are going to use this charger with. Price was very budget friendly and the weight of the charge is no issue. Adapter stays plugged into the outlet and does not fall off or pull out on its own.",
