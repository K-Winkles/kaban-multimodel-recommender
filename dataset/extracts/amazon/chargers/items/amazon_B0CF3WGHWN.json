They come in deep black and white colors, both of which look sleek and stylish. The compact size makes them extremely portable, fitting easily into my bag or pocket without adding any bulk.Durability is another factor where these power banks shine. They feel sturdy and well-built, capable of withstanding the rigors of daily use. The LED indicators are very convenient, providing a clear idea of the remaining charge, so I\u2019m never caught off guard.In conclusion, the LOVELEDI Portable-Charger-Power-Bank 2 Pack offers remarkable value.

They are light, well built, and a real life saver. With Disney being so phone-use heavy, the parks tried to cash in on their constantly requiring your phone use, by renting power banks. No need to rent anything while having these banks. Being able to fully charge multiple phones at one time sure made things easier. They charged quickly over night and were ready for their next park each day. Definitely worth every penny and highly recommend them! Nice job Lovledi!",

                "reviewText": "Bought ours for our Christmas trip to Disneyland and I loved that it comes with two, one for each. We used ONLY one throughout the two days we were at the parks (ofc with charging them the nights at the hotel). The battery life on them is lengthy and super reliable. Another plus was that it has many options for the type of chargers such as a USB or USB-C. I totally recommend these certain battery chargers, they\u2019re not a hassle and easy to use to charge your phones. Great for trips and if going to Disney, these are the best ones to use and they store easily! I even carry one in my purse now as a backup incase I don\u2019t have a charger connected to my car!",

                "reviewText": "I don't have a lot to compare these to; but I bought this terrifically well priced two pack after having bought a single one earlier. Power went out for twelve hours overnight during a summer thunderstorm and I decided I need a strategy for such outages. I got some rechargeable lamps that I keep on chargers all the time, a couple of reading lamps that have USB charging and internal batteries, and decided it makes sense to have power for my phone and laptop as well as an internet connection if this happens again. So these have an impressively high stated capacity and should run my phone which has a hotspot and I can connect my tablet to it to have entertainment and connection.With three of them I expect them to last at least a day or two, keep my personal electronics running and worst case I could recharge these with my car. And they allow for fast charging for smaller devicesThey look good (not that it matters) and they are pretty compact, about the size of a cell phone; have versatile input and output. If there's any shortcoming it's that the only outputs are both USB A (while using C and Micro to charge up) so I picked up some USB A to USB C adapters to make sure I could use a variety of cords for them and I keep them constantly charged. Not critical since most of us will have some USB A to whatever cords around.Maybe I'll never have an outage that long again but shorter outages are quite common where I live when summer monsoons roll through. I now feel I have what I need to make these events tolerable -- light, and information and entertainment. A battery powered fan should round out the needs.And they were a lot cheaper than a Tesla power wall (which ultimately is the right solution to power outages...) which I considered very briefly.",
