The idea of two of the iPhone chargers on one sold me. It came in and I tested it. It charged up multiple devices, as promised. But what sent me here to leave a review was the fact that my husband accidentally washed a load of laundry with this in it. We have no clue how it got in our hamper (we suspect our toddler did it) but my husband only realized when he went to switch the load to the dryer. We expected this was broken and we\u2019re ready to toss it. But it was dry and I decided to test it. It still worked perfectly! Not many items can make it through a load of laundry and come out looking and working like it hadn\u2019t. The only way I could confirm it actually got washed was because it smells like our detergent lol. I\u2019m very impressed this held up through the washing machine. We\u2019ll definitely buy this brand again when we need more in the future.",
