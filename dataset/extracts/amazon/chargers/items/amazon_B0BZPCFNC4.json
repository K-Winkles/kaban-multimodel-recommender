                "reviewText": "These pair of cables are double the size of the standard cable you would get with the OEM device. The extra three feet actually does help. The wall charging brick is the same as the OEM in size but slightly different shade of white (not very noticeable). I am able to actually sit further away from the outlet while charging my ipad which is great. In terms of look and feel, the cable similar to the style of the original Apple cable but it does have a bit of a cheaper feel. It also is not as flexible as the OEM but I do not really care much about that. Also it has a longer length. The cables are able to both charge and sync which is great if you happen to be needing to connect your ipad or iphone to your mac. Like any of the original white cable, it is prone to the yellowing from constant use and being left out in direct sunlight so be aware of that. Also note that because it is not an oem, there is always a chance it may burn out sooner than oem but that is just because of the chip inside of any cable. The cable again does have a different feel. It can kind of feel the different texture that it feels a little rougher but to the eye it is hard to tell apart. The wall plug can be used with this cable or other cables which is nice. From all the charging, it does not overheat or anything when plugged in which is great. I would still keep this in the open air if possible. It works well with my iPhone and the brick has not issues with iPad. The charging brick has the power required to charge an ipad without issue. The neck on the cable neck does feel very similar to the oem so I am a little worried about fraying in the future. The cables are able to sync the iphone as well to your computer. Overall this cable and wall plug work very well. They are pretty much the same as the oem ones you get but the cable is just a few feet longer. The power brick works pretty well. Be aware that it is also prone to yellowing so do not leave these in direct sunlight if you can.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Comes in nice packaging and build quality giving confidence in long-term durability. Coming to functionality, I must say this delivers the power as desired and saves a lot compared to Apple\u2019s fast charger adapter. I used to charge my iPhone 12 pro and my wife's iPhone 14 pro and it charged pretty fast. Overall happy with the product.My 2 cents below:Pros:- PD charging works like a charm. Really fast charging using the PD port- Very small in size. It is a very portable adapter and great for traveling- Has multiple safety standards- Set of 2 power adapters is very reasonably priced. Probably one of the cheapest options you can get anywhereCons:- I wish cables were included in the set as well",
