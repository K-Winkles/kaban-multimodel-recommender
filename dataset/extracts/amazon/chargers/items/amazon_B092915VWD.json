It stayed in my house so it was not moved around a lot or nothing and it quit working a few weeks past the return window so now im just out the money and have to buy a new charger and since this is the only charger i have for my new iphone 15, i will have to purchase one at a store unless i want to go without my phone for several days which i cannot do because i have 4 kids. Not happy at all.",
