With USB C, I can charge devices real fast and don\u2019t have to wait all day to get it fully charged. New and old devices can be easily charged without a hassle. I love the feature of having both USB ports as I can use the two different types of cable. I use it for iPhone, watch and iPad. I use it for Android devices as well. Works great and highly recommend the product.",

It\u2019s 5 Volt, 3 Amp, and total total 20 watts of power easily charges my Apple Watch, iPhone 14, iPad, and various other devices simultaneously, quickly, and fully. This would be a great bargain for a single unit but it\u2019s an even better one in that you get a total of three units in the deal. This is a must have product for its quality and value. I highly recommend and give it 5 stars all the way around!",
