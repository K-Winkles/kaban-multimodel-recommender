                "reviewText": "My wife recently switched from an Android phone to Apple and it caused a bit of a headache around the house as all of our chargers are USB-A to USB-C.Apple was generous enough to give us a USB-C to Lightning cable but outside of the charging block that came with my phone we had nothing to charge her phone when she's working at her desk or her bedside table or in the car. Cue these babies.Decent length, six foot cables are a absolute must unless you're directly in front of a USB port and even then the standard three foot cable doesn't leave you with a lot of room to move around as you use your phone.Feels decent quality, cord and plugs feel significantly sturdier than the OEM cable but only time will tell if they hold up compared to Apple's offering. Will update if/when either cable fails.Not sure the charging speed as I'm not the one using it and these cables are only really in use when the phone is idle but I plan on doing a test in the future.Works great on the latest greatest iPhone on the latest iOS as of the time of this writing. I remember friends back in the day getting skunked by 3rd party cables that would fail to function on certain models of Apple phone or lose compatibility when they updated the iOS.I like the divot on the USB-A end, gives it a better grip and something distinct to feel for as you're groping around in the dark under your bed trying to find the charging block for your phone.I got the 4 pack as we needed one for the car, one for her desk and one for her side of the bed. 4th one is a backup/future use case. But you could definitely get by with only two.Overall I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend them for the price.",
