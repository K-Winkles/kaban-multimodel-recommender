This cable works with my old Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Adapter for Fire Tablets and Kindle eReaders. Because the cable is 6 feet long, I can charge my old Kindle while reading in bed--the wall socket is about 5 feet away. I haven't had this cable long enough to rate its sturdiness, and I haven't compared its charging power to the power of my original cable. I'm not familiar with cables, so I don't know if I could have gotten another one that works as well as this one and costs less.",
