Even on a cord that stays plugged into the same outlet and rarely gets moved anywhere else, the wires get exposed pretty quickly. It is definitely beneficial to have the set of different lengths!!!",

Charging speed is not very fast but if you want multiple cords and don't want to spend the extra money for the speed chargers, these are definitely a great option. Giving them a 4/5 because of the mediocre speed of charge and that I went through all 5 within 15 months.",
