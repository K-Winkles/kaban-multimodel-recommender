These fast chargers were a lifesaver! They charged her iPad faster than the cord that came with the iPad originally, and since we got a three-pack we have extras in case she can't find the charger in her room. Plus, the cords are just the right lenghth - not too short and not too long. The chargers were packaged nicely and delivered quickly, too. We will definitely look for these again if the need arises!",

I have 2 teenagers and my teen girls go crazy when there phone's die or the charger just isn't charging fast enough. With these I don't have to worry about that. Within 30 mins the phones are completely charged. I just ordered another set for my husband and I. I will NEVER order/buy anywhere else for iPhone chargers.",

There's so many non-approved on amazon, almost 95% of the chargers on here.The name ILOUYOU sounds really weird, so it surprised me when I found it on the approved list.2. Tested it, all 3 blocks worked with my iphone 15 apple OEM cable3. For 3 blocks for 15 bucks is great. I repeat.I didn't find any iphone 15 charging blocks that were approved. Weird. so instead, I bought these, and will buy usb-c x2 cables separately to go with the blocks. These cables are usb-c to lightning (for iphones 12-14)Anyways, happy I found these. Just be careful when buying chargers and cables, make sure you check the model number on apples MFI approved list. Amazon doesn't screen their vendors products.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a set of iPhone chargers that included three USB C lightning cables and three blocks. Two of the cables and all three blocks worked flawlessly, which was great. However, I encountered a problem with the third cable, as it turned out to be defective and couldn't charge my phone.I reached out to the customer service team to seek assistance, and they were prompt in their response. However, I was informed that in order to receive a refund or replacement for the faulty cable, I would need to return all three sets from the original purchase. This posed a challenge for me since I had already given one complete set, including a block and cable, to my nephew and another to my brother, both of whom are currently not living with me.My disappointment stemmed from the fact that I've been a loyal Prime member for over two years, and I was hoping for a more flexible solution. Ideally, I was looking to have just the defective USB C cable replaced, which seemed like a straightforward request. Regrettably, I was told that this wasn't possible within their policy.What's even more concerning is that these chargers are not OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) products. When comparing them to an authentic Apple charger, there's a noticeable difference. In the case of the OEM charger, the cable fits snugly into the block, leaving no gap. However, with these three blocks, there is a small gap when inserting the cable, which exposes the metal part of the USB C cable. This gap is significant enough that it could potentially allow a penny or dime to slip in, causing a short circuit. This is a safety hazard, especially if your phone is charging, as it could potentially damage the device.In conclusion, while the majority of the chargers in this set worked perfectly, the experience was marred by the defective cable and the inconvenience of having to return all items for a refund. Moreover, the safety concern regarding the gap in the charger design is something that should be seriously considered before purchasing these chargers. I hope this review helps provide a balanced perspective on my experience with these chargers, with a particular emphasis on the potential safety issue.",
