                "reviewText": "I purchased this 2 pack about 2 years ago. I am sad, I lost one at some point. But the one I do have still is used at home almost daily. We keep it in our main room and everyone uses it. My wife, daughter, myself, and any guests. Always have a charger for anyone here. And I've taken it on about 4 vacations, 2 out of the country!All charging ports work perfect, and, are still like new 2 years later. No cracks, bent charging heads, nothing! And I am not super careful with them either. I have not tested the data port for the Apple plug. I use Samsung devices. My wife uses Apple, but, she never connects her phone to a computer. So, I cannot comment on the data Apple plug (yes, this plug also will just charge).Be sure to use a quality AC plug. I use an Anker Quick Charge 3.0 / 18W 3A. If you use a slow wall charger, it won't charge multiple devices very well. Even with a nice charging block, charging 4 devices will be slow (but, it is good for bed time, plug in all your devices, and in the morning all will be charged). It charges 1 or 2 devices very fast, and 3 devices at an acceptable speed. Really makes traveling a lot easier just having to bring one cord for all my wife and my devices. She uses the 2 Apple plugs for her iPhone and AirPods, I use the USB C for my phone, and Micro USB for my portable battery backup.Overall, this cord has proven to be durable, long lasting, and it works exactly as it should. If you are looking for a muli port charging cord, this is one to get!",
