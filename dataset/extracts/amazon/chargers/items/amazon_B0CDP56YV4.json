The long charging cable gives the freedom to use phone while it's in, which is a huge. I have tried chargers in the past, but this one truly stands out as the best of the best. I will definitely be recommending this product to all of my friends and family.",

Purchase at your own discretionUpdate: Only days later after leaving this review did my charger completely stop working.

If you've never tried using a phone charger with an XL cord, it's time to take the leap and change your life forever.The hardware itself is not Apple, which is obvious from looking at it. It isn't one of those super fast lighting chargers. But it does the job, it's durable, and like I said it's a super long cord!! 10/10 would buy again.Also of note: the connection between the cord and the brick is a USB-C port. So if you're traveling or you otherwise normally plug into a regular USB-A port, you won't be able to do that with this charger.",
