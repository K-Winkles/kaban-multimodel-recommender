                "reviewText": "There\u2019s typically either one way to go or the other with this type of product, either it\u2019s good quality or it\u2019s just not. This one so far seems pretty solid quality. The cords are really nice, and a whole lot better than the others I\u2019ve gotten with sets similar to this one. The usb slots are pretty firm which is important for me as I\u2019m not gentle all the time when I forget I\u2019m plugged in and try to run off without unplugging my phone. The outlet does come out of the port fairly easily but it isn\u2019t super loose. The blue light on it is pretty bright. Overall I\u2019d definitely recommend it and if I need another I\u2019d order it again. I didn\u2019t pay attention and thought it would be two USBc to usbc cords but it\u2019s fine as one of my iPhones still uses lightning so I still get use out of the lightning cord.",
