They would not charge the iPAD if it was plugged in and being used at the same time. The cords would get hot and just not great quality. I've been using this cord for a few days, and this is as if I'm using the original charger! It doesn't get hot, feels like great quality (like it won't easily break!), charges the iPAD quickly and efficiently and will charge even as I'm using it! Highly recommend if you need a replacement or just a second charger to have handy! The cord is just long enough to not be restricted but also not get in the way! Great purchase!",

Yes, it\u2019s taken FOUR tries before I\u2019ve finally given up on the lure of a long cord and cheap price - that\u2019s on me, having faith that one of these would actually hold up longer than a month.When I started the return process for this last defective charger - the ONLY one I\u2019ve attempted to return, and not just throw in the trash - I found that they require the original packaging, which I don\u2019t have a month after buying - so again, I\u2019m out the purchase price and unable to charge my iPad Pro. So, cool.TLDR; DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK, even once, let alone multiple times like I did.",
