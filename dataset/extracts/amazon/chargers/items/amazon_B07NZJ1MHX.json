I was really having very slow charger problems with my Galaxy S8, I didn't know if it was my old fast charger, my battery, or whether I had damaged my phone by dropping it. That question was answered immediately after I plugged in this new charger. It works very fast, my phone charged up in a little less than 90 minutes, and it doesn't get hot (unlike a couple of other reviews I've read on this site). I love the longer cable, and the quality of charger is pretty good, on par with much more expensive ones at the phone store, plus I received two chargers and cables in the package, so I can keep one set in my study and use the other for travel. Definitely good value! I don't know why some folks have had problems with this charger, but perhaps their phone is a different brand than Samsung or just isn't one of the compatible models listed.",
