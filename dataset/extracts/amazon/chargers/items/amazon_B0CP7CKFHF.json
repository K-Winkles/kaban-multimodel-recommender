Which they worked perfectly for and look awesome. I really like that the pack offers multiple lengths and the braided jacket and colors are super cool looking. I did however test them on charging my Google Pixel 7a and could not get them to rapid charge with any of the lengths included. While this is not what I ordered these for it's not a big deal to me but if you are looking to rapid charge your phone with these this might be an issue for you.Overall great looking, versatile lengths, its a USB A to USB C cable but doesn't rapid charge.",

                "reviewText": "I love the colors first off. I know that's not the most important thing but why do all these cords have to be just black and white? Why not throw some jewel tones in there now and then?I don't know for sure but I feel like the fabric cords hold up a little bit better than the plastic coated ones. Mine was frayed and the wires were showing, it was long past time to replace. I tested each one of these and all work fine.About the fast charging. If I plug it directly into a wall outlet with a USB-A receptacle it's just regular charging. In order to get the fast charging I have to plug the USB-A end into one of those cubes and then plug that into the electrical outlet. As I said I tested each one and each one was regular charging directly into the wall, fast charging if I use the cube. Just thought that was important information.The longer cord will be really good for my security camera. This is a really good deal for three cords.",

                "reviewText": "I've said it before and I'll say it many times. If you don't own any 10ft charging cables, get as many as you can. They will change your life. That being said, having a variety of sizes is good too. Nothing worse than having a bunch of excess cable flopping around on your desk when your phone is only 2 feet from the charger. I've owned several different kinds of aftermarket charging cables, and I've had a couple stinkers. So far this set has been good to me so it gets my recommendation. Good deal.",

                "reviewText": "I have ordered and used cables like these for years now but of course not always the same seller or manufacturer. However, I purchase a few sets at a time and then they seems to last 1-2 years depending on how much they are used and manipulated. I think that js definitely acceptable based on usage and the overall cost. So I ordered these to replace old cables just like them. Over time they begin to not to work so well and they will fade slowly due to the bending and charging repeatedly for months. These have been working great so far as they have fast charged multiple devices. These can literally bend in any direction and Judy keep on working due to the quality materials. I also appreciate the different colors and lengths that are offered. 5\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 For the price, I think that's acceptable.",
