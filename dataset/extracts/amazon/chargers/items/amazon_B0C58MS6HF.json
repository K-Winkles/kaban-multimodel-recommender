The capacity reduction during charging is due to a 30% to 45% energy loss in the battery cells and conversion circuitry. Therefore, a fully charged Anker 334 MagGo Battery (PowerCore 10K) offers an estimated 5,500mAh to 7,000mAh to power devices. How can I estimate the number of charges for my device? To estimate charging cycles, use these formula: (Power Bank Capacity \u00d7 0.55) \u00f7 Device Battery Capacity \u2248 Number of Charges. For instance, charging a 3,000mAh device using a 10,000mAh power bank would offer approximately 2.16 charges.",

                "reviewText": "The battery works well to charge the iPhone 15 pro max. The magsafe properties perform well to keep the battery attached to the phone. It is a little bulkier than I expected, which is more about my unrealistic expectations than the battery's actual size. It adds quite a bit of weight to the phone, so don't expect to want to carry it around attached to the phone. The case is somewhat slippery, and would benefit from surface textured grips on the sides to make it easier to hold onto when on the phone in use and when attaching and removing the battery. I'm not quite getting the battery life I expected. I'm getting about 1-1/2 charges between recharging. The magsafe battery does work to charge my phone when the charging cable is plugged in; however, the USB-A port does not operate when the charging cable is plugged in to the USB-C port. Not a big issue since I can plug a USB-C cable into the iPhone and use it as a charger while the battery recharges the iPhone.",

I do imagine that the fact that it is an iPhone Pro Max has much to do with the Anker draining faster.Pro: Has great magnetic connectivty with the iPhone and magsafe, and has a USB-A port to charge devices that are not magasafe.I am happy with my purchase, I got it for around $34 Feb 2024",

From my first anker product I\u2019ve ever purchased I noticed right away the quality, durability, functionality, styling, and longevity of the product and this one is no different. It has a great matte finish with glossy letters that subtly say anker. I have the purple iPhone and this one is a purple tint that matches perfectly, the product snaps right to the back stays on fairly well, it\u2019s not meant to be swung around while on but you can certainly use the phone or go about your business with light being tethered to a wall. I use this thing on many other products, mostly plugged in. Not every product can accept the charge by placing the unit on it so you can just plug right into it. When I expect to be out all day on business or riding my motorcycle this thing always comes with me. It\u2019s a battery, it has some weight to it but you\u2019re also free to move around. Highly recommend",
