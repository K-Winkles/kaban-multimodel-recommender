                "reviewText": "Durable woven cable cover, both ends are shaped to resist breaking at what is usually the most vulnerable part of data/charging cables. I expect these to last the remaining life of all Lightning devices I still have, and I feel good about extending the useful life of older electronics -- but if I need to get more, you can't beat this price for a 3-pack.The uses for this cable are MYRIAD. Charging, of course, but also many networking possibilities.Though I haven't used them for this purpose, they should be good for a direct wired connection between older Apple devices and newer ones with USB-c (Thunderbolt) port, meaning you can set up a new device & transfer data from your old one without using WiFi or Bluetooth. You can also tether a Lightning-port iOS device to a newer laptop (Windows, Chromebook, or Mac) with a USB-c port, to use the Apple device's Internet connection.With this cable you can also use a newer (USB-c) device with cell service as a USB-connected hotspot to an older Apple device (even a WiFi-only iPad) rather than rely on spotty WiFi or Bluetooth connections. The blue & white color is very pretty/peaceful/calming, easy to see & find among a tangle of wires. The length (nearly 6') and sturdy build makes it practical for home or office desks, car or other travel use.They work great with a 20W fast-charge USB-c power bricks for charging a very old iPad Pro and iPhone SE (2018) or data/power connection to computers with USB-c ports.I can't say enough about how pleased I am with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a lightning cable and I'm really impressed with its performance. The cable is of high quality and feels durable, which is great because I've had issues with other cables fraying or breaking easily in the past. The length of the cable is perfect for my needs, allowing me to comfortably use my device while it's charging without feeling restricted.The lightning cable also charges my device quickly, which is a huge plus. I've noticed that it charges my phone faster compared to some other cables I've used before. The connection is secure and I haven't experienced any issues with it disconnecting randomly or being loose.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with this lightning cable. It's reliable, durable, and charges my device efficiently. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in need of a high-quality lightning cable.",

I have only used 1 of them. These cords are sturdy and charge my iPhone 13 Pro really well. I would suggest getting these cords. The are of the cord where you plug it into the phone seems very sturdy so far. If they continue to last like this, I will be able to use these cords for a long time to come.",

I like that they come in a 2 pack (I honestly didn't even know it was a 2 pack when I ordered, so that was a pleasant surprise) so that I can have one cable at my computer and one next to my bed so that the phone is always charged. The USB-C fast charging is quick & efficient and I've had these cables for several months now with no issues :)",

                "reviewText": "First the quality seems nice, the wrapped wires and the connectors seem well built. But the reality is it maxes out at 9W for charging. I have a large off grid power bank that we use for travel and camping as well as emergencies around the house. It has DC an 18W and a 100W USBC port as well as 12v and AC 240 and 120. All of which are controlled and monitored.I included the monitor image to show the output and it is the same using the 100W or 18W this cable is not capable of the claimed 20W charging.Other than the false claim it is great and a value for cables, the seller should just amend the details. It also transfers data so it is a really nice package.",
