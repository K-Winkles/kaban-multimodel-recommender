Power cord is a good length and lightweight and allows the charger to be closer to your devices rather than hidden near the power socket. Because of the power cord plug, it also can be plugged into any available outlet whereas other chargers without power cords need a lot of space around the outlet. Even when powering several devices (including a laptop) the unit remains pretty cool, only slightly warm to the touch. Construction seems solid with nothing loose or wobbly about it, would recommend it.",
