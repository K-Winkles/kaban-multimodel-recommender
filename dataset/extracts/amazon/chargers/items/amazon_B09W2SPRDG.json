                "reviewText": "The product comes with two, so I gave the other to my spouse.She uses a Motorola phone, it charges but not as quick. Much like a regular charger.On my Samsung, when you insert cord one way it says \"Super Fast Charger\" when you insert the opposite way, it charges like a regular slow charger. You could use a sharpie and put a dot on the fast side but I had a pack of cheap small jewels with adhesive on one side and this worked perfect for me.By the way, I was concerned about the extra long cords but after receiving them, the length to me was a plus because with two people charging in the same room, I can use a different outlet altogether and not be intrusive to the other person's needs.",

                "reviewText": "I've bought this item (2 pack with 10 ft cables) 3 times now. Not because they've gone bad, but because I've had one stolen, and I wanted backups. Then I also decided to put one in the office and one in the bedroom. I have nothing bad to say about them. They've all worked flawlessly and have never gone bad, and still charge at a super-fast speed. The oldest one I have is about 13 months old I think and works just as well as the one I bought a week ago. My ONLY complaint (if you could call it that) is that I'm more a fan of the feel of braided cables instead of the rubber ones, but for THIS type of cable, I give it 10/10 Would (and probably will) buy again!",
