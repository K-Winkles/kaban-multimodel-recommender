Cords appear to be tough enough to withstand the abuse from our kids, grands and great grands. The cord is the perfect length for almost any location, long enough to be convenient but not excessive in length to become tangled. We will give these to our family when they visit, every one of them in desperate need to charge their devices and never having a charger available. Cost is very reasonable making additional purchases possible as further needs arise when family members carry our \u201cextra\u201d chargers home with them. (They are not really extras but conveniently placed throughout our home for our convenience, not requiring us to constantly move the location of the chargers.)
