                "reviewText": "This tent is well made and super easy to set up. My 4 year old helped me do a lot of it! We added some fairy lights, rugs, pillows and blankets and my kids love it!The frame is made of pvc so it's not going to survive rough housing and sitting against the walls. That being said, it stands up great and is sturdy on its own. It feels solid enough to be a book to play in.It comes with a bottom flap too so the fabric stays put in place. It has 3 windows with sheer curtains.Feels quality and aesthetically pleasing. I'm very happy that I selected this one. Great value for the $60 I paid on sale. Would highly recommend if in the market.",

The corner ripped when I tried to hard to pull it over one of the corners, but that was my fault. It's also surprisingly tall and tall 8yr old could stand in it towards the middle. 10 out of 10",

She also is thought to maybe have adhd so this will give her a calm space when she\u2019s having a hard time regulating her emotions. She loves the openness of this and also that she can stand right up in it without crouching down at all. She\u2019s also on the tall side for her age. She loves to sleep in it, too, when she wants a change from her bunkbed. She said the only thing she would tweak would be a second set of curtains that offer more privacy when she needs it but she still loves the sheers bc it lets more light in and is just pretty and elegant. It has a canvas bottom that is the same as the top. Instructions were not too hard but we had a hard time at first because she didn\u2019t want to wait on me to put it together\ud83d\ude05. So she initially got the parts mixed up. I\u2019d definitely buy this again. Perfect purchase!!",
