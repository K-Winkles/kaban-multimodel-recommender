                "reviewText": "First, these do not come with a hook, so you need to use whatever you can find that works, either a hook or a stand. I had a previous two-piece shower mirror that had a razor hook, so I just stand my new mirror up where a razor would go. See photo.Now, pay attention if you want to be happy: This mirror fogged up pretty quickly on my first use. But I remembered how my last mirror worked, removing it from that stand to fill a slot in the the back with hot water. So now, with this new mirror, the trick is to heat the BACK of the mirror by holding it in the hot shower water for about 15-30 seconds. It now stays fog free for the rest of my shower.Final note, also a lesson learned from my last mirror. Do not wait until water drops have dried on the face of your mirror over months and years of use. You will ruin the mirror trying to clean water spots off after they have dried. Instead, while drying your body, take a few seconds at the end of every shower to gently blot away the water drops while still wet.Enjoy!",

I suggest leaving it under hot water for about 10 seconds on both the front and back so it warms up and resists fogging.There is no fastening solution provided. You will need to buy your own hook to hang it on the wall.",
