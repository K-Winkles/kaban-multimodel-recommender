It was really easy to put up, thr adhesive so far has been sufficiently strong, and the letters are pretty thin so they lay nicely against the wall. My wife had been wanting something like this and she's thrilled with how this looks on the wall. It really looks great and the letters have a nice finish/ look to them. Plus they're reasonably priced.For full transparency I received this item for free as part of the Amazon Vine review program. This is my honest review and is not affected by my membership in this. Overall, this item is one I WOULD consider buying myself if I had not received it through this program.",
