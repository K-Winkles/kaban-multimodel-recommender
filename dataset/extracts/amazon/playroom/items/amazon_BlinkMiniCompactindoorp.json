Offering 1080p HD video, night vision, and two-way audio, it's a powerhouse for monitoring your home day and night.Here's the lowdown \u2013 it's smaller, but the wire can be a bit of a drag. A trade-off, really. Personally, I lean towards the battery-operated version for its flexibility, but this one has a key advantage \u2013 no battery anxiety. No worrying about the battery going dead; it's a plug-and-forget situation.The setup is a breeze \u2013 plug it in, connect to WiFi, and follow the app instructions. Now, about that wire \u2013 if your outlet is close, this is a worry-free choice. No more stressing about windy days draining your battery. But if you're dealing with more wires than you'd like, the battery-powered Blink might be your hero.In a nutshell, it's all about the outlet proximity. If it's right there, go for this one; no fuss, no frills. If you need more flexibility, the battery version is your go-to. Security made simple!",

                "reviewText": "Update : I finally did manage to get 4 of my 6 cameras set up (haven't unboxed the last 2 yet). It took approximately 6 attempts for each camera to connect to my wifi. I have no idea why.The video quality is decent. However the audio quality is questionable at times. I also wish that I could record longer than 30 seconds for motion events as the camera doesn't retrigger quickly enough to keep recording if there is motion past the 30 second window.Other than that they have been a great help to keep an eye on my dogs and house while I am away. I just wish they weren't so mentally draining to set up.Bought these to keep an eye on my house while I'm away. Never had so much buyers remorse over a purchase as I do with these.After fighting with an immediate failed connection attempt 9 times in a row on one of the two cameras, I went to google and discovered that the Xfinity Gateway router needs to have the wifi bands separated to 5ghz and 2.4ghz. I did that, managed to get one to connect after 4 attempts, still cannot get the second one to connect to the same network 14 tries later.I've tried everything the help article stated. Nothing works. Literally nothing. It's 9pm and I'm not going to bother calling support at this point. These are likely going back in the box and back to Amazon. This is obnoxious. I've done every single step the exact same way as the camera I did manage to connect and this second one just will not do it, no matter what I try.Taking everything in me to not throw my phone across the room every time the \"Failed to connect\" message pops up. Their troubleshooting page is absolute hot garbage for help with this issue.",
