I needed to cut them to create a circle mirror, and if you plan on cutting them, they are difficult to cut. Most of the time the pieces would snap off in a clean line, but sometimes it would create cracks and chips. Along the edge that I cut nothing is sharp. So it is truly shatter proof and safe for a child\u2019s room. As you can see when you line the mirrors together if you are looking at yourself in that specific spot of the mirror, the image is warped, but other than that the quality of the mirror is amazing it\u2019s just like any other mirror you would buy. My only complaint is I wish they came in a bigger size.",

                "reviewText": "After having several large door mirrors break I decided to try these mirrored panels. Using the ridiculously strong adhesive I attached them to my door and to my dismay the result is horrible! As other reviewers mentioned there is a massive distortion toward the edges where the tiles meet up with each other. I want to remove them for a refund but as other reviewers mentioned, the ridiculously strong adhesive will likely damage my Hollow core door.I'm EXTREMELY unhappy with these results and I DO NOT RECOMMEND!",

I did not use the adhesive so I cant speak to that. I propped the mirrors up against furniture around my little one's play area. Baby loves interacting with the baby in the mirror. Eventhough I handle them gingerly, I noticed they scratch easily. That's disappointing so I removed 2 stars.",
