I got so many compliments on the banners. Everyone wanted to know where I got them. You have to assemble them yourself. They provide a few needles to thread the string into the precut holes in the flags. It didn\u2019t take very long at all and is easy to do. I will definitely be using these for awhile. I liked them so much I hung the flags above my baby\u2019s crib and stored the birthday part away until next year. I think these are great quality and price.",
