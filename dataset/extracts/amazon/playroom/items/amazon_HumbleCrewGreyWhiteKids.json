I called the company and the sweet lady on the phone gave me directions on how to order the missing parts from them. They sent them out and we were still able to get it put together a week before Christmas! It is small, which may be a downside for some, but it\u2019s a positive for us. It went together in about five minutes flat, is super lightweight, super cute, and is sturdy enough to trust my toddler around. It holds about 24 children\u2019s books, if anyone\u2019s wondering. We are ordering a second one now for all of the new books my baby got for Christmas!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve repurchased twice as my toddler\u2019s library keeps growing. Can be placed adjacent to one another without gaps. Fits a surprising number of books of different shapes and sizes. Easy for kiddo to pull books out and put them back in, as well. The shelves are poly fabric slings and is one piece of material that you string the included metal poles through to create the different layers. The wood side panels are composite painted white, not solid wood. Everything you need is included, except for a basic screwdriver to get the screws tight once assembled. I\u2019ve assembled these myself in about five minutes. When against the wall there\u2019s some space between the sling and the wall in case you have an outlet there it won\u2019t touch. When it\u2019s filled with books I\u2019ve never been concerned with or had one topple bc the leg base is wide, but if you wanted to you could wall mount from each end (wall mount not included). It\u2019s not fancy but it\u2019s solid and hasn\u2019t failed us yet in 1.5 years. The pastel is colorful but not loud. You can see the screws from the outside but if that bothers you then order some of those white sticker screw covers. Honestly love these.",
