Easy to take outside and shake clean. It can be hosed off too. Only complaint is if the rug snags in any way, the vacuum grabs the snag right up and tugs threads out of the rug. The cat likes to sharpen her claws on it, too. That\u2019s a problem but no fault of the rug. I bought a second rug for the bedroom.",
