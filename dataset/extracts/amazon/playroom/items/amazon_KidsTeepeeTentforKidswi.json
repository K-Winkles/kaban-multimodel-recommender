Tent material had a few wrinkles but they will fall out with time or it can be steamed out. Stars are a cute touch once added. Misconception is no mat/ pad for the bottom of the tent is included. Poles are wood , but they come in pieces and are connected by plastic attachments. For the price , this is the way to go!! VERY easy to put together. The string to tie the poles together is a bit challenging. I added my own touches to make the space more inviting to my daughter. She has ASD and our goal was to make her a quiet / positive space.",
