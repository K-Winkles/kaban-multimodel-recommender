Plus they are super easy to put together. Take them out of the box, cut the zip tie, and then stack them.

The sizing shown in listing is exactly correct so keep it in mind - but even knowing the size they would be they still seemed smaller upon receiving. They are skinny in the width but \u2018deep\u2019 in the length.I am going to use small zip ties on the back of the shelves to keep each bin together and then secure the system to the wall so my kiddos can\u2019t pull it down or apart.I still think this will be perfect for our toys, and I even plan to order a second one.",
