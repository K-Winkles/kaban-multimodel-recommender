These upgraded furniture straps have provided me with peace of mind by offering a secure and reliable solution to prevent furniture from tipping over and potentially harming my child.The installation process was straightforward, and the included hardware made securing the anchors to my furniture and walls a breeze. I was impressed with the durable materials and robust design of these furniture straps, which give me confidence that my table is securely anchored and resistant to tipping over, even in unexpected situations like earthquakes.One feature I appreciate is that these furniture anchors have been upgraded to meet the latest safety standards in 2022, providing enhanced protection for my child. With a weight capacity of up to 400 pounds, these furniture straps are suitable for securing a wide range of furniture, from dressers to cabinets to bookshelves.Knowing that my child is protected from potential furniture tip-over accidents is invaluable to me as a parent. I highly recommend the Furniture Anchors (10 Pack) for any parent or caregiver looking to ensure their child's safety. These furniture straps are easy to install, durable, and provide reliable anti-tip protection for child safety.",
