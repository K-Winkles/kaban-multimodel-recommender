                "reviewText": "I first would like to say I very rarely write reviews but I was so impressed with this product I decided I should. I paid $37 and change and fully expected to get my money's worth (and that's not that much money if you know what I mean) but I needed a toy organizer and the colors were right. Anyways, this organizer included 12 bins which are very sturdy, not thin plastic and a very nice quality. You get four large and they are plenty big and nine med/small which hold enough... All together it is amazing how much you really can get stored with all 12. The stand had to be put together but it took me about fifteen minutes and is pretty self explanatory but it did come with included picture instructions. Once it was all put together I was happy to see it is only 15 inches deep so it hardly takes up any room in a small bedroom (much less room than toys all over the floor! The height of the organizer is perfect for my three year old to see what's in each bin and playing and returning the toys to thier new home is almost a much fun as just playing now. I purchased the multi color and it came with a nice pastel shade of green,pink, yellow and blue bins.The colors are quite nice and don't look cheap. I highly recommend this bin organizer and I feel like the price I just got it at was a steal for the quality.",
