In some cases we wanted two polaroid photos per clip so we also ordered from Amazon neodymium magnets 8x1mm to give the clips extra strength for more than a single photo.

                "reviewText": "I searched forever for an easy way to display and swap out the mountains of artwork my toddler brings home from daycare, from frames to wires with hooks and finally settled on this system. It\u2019s easy to install and pretty straightforward in terms of how to display artwork. I knocked off one star because I think the metal wires could be a little thicker to provide more surface area for the magnets on the clip to cling to and vastly improve the product. You have to mess with them a bit to use the right number of clips to hold it up if you have anything heavier than a piece of printer or coloring book paper. Overall, I\u2019m happy with the product and would purchase again.",
