The size was slightly bigger than I expected, however, I was able to get it to fit neatly in her room, and it was light enough that I could build it in my room, and carry it into her room (As my room had more room). Once within the room, It was easy to place the bins in, and it was easy for them to move in and out to reorganize, and spacious enough that I could a majority of her toys in there.I do wish that it wasn't as bulky as it is to move around, but it is good quality and has helped massively at keeping her room organized.",

Its extra-large size makes it perfect for storing a wide variety of toys.The organizer includes 12 standard size open storage plastic bins and 4 double size open storage plastic bins. These removable bins are great for playtime and cleanup. They\u2019re durable, easy to clean, and easy to assemble.What I love about this organizer is its material. It\u2019s made of wood, plastic, and metal, ensuring it can withstand the rough and tumble of everyday play. Plus, it\u2019s BPA and phthalate-free, which gives me peace of mind knowing it\u2019s safe for my children.One tip I\u2019ve found helpful is to secure the organizer to the wall. This provides extra stability, especially if your kids are a little rough with it.In summary, the Humble Crew Supersized Wood Toy Storage Organizer is a practical and efficient solution for toy storage. It\u2019s helped transform my children\u2019s play area into an organized, clutter-free space.",

The box arrived, dirty, scuffed, and gouged with a bent in corner, and I was expecting the worst. I opened it up and was shocked to find the unit was unscathed. It went together very quickly(literally the quickest piece of baby furniture I think I\u2019ve ever assembled.) it seems sturdy and looks nice. None of my polypropylene buckets were damaged in any way, despite the fact that there is no packing material between them and the other boards in the box, apart from a very thin piece of bubble wrap.I would recommend this toy storage unit. I think it is a great value for the price. I am pleased to report there are no smells at all. It doesn\u2019t have the green guard gold certification like the Delta one but I don\u2019t see why not because nothing seems to be offgassing.",
