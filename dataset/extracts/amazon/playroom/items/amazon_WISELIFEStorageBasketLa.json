                "reviewText": "I love this basket because of the value and size, it's hard to find decent rope baskets for a good price. The colors are muted so it is versatile and can go into any theme designed space. I do want to say the structural support is not there, the edges at the top fold in. If you're filling with toys it is great, if you're filling with pillows and throws it will also be great, but don't expect for the corner of your throw blanket to hang over the top edge and not fold the basket down. The handles are my favorite part because they're incredibly thick and sturdy and even with a lot of weight in the basket, they won't break.",

                "reviewText": "It's huge. I have 3 pretty thick blankets in mine, and it holds them well. It looks very good. One caveat, however, is that I think if I did not have mine stuffed full, it probably would not hold its shape well at all. I think that if you want something out in the open that won't always be full, and you want something that holds its shape extremely well, you likely could find better options. However, in my case I just wanted something that held my blankets at the end of the couch out of the way, and this works very well.",

                "reviewText": "This rope basket is the solution I've been looking for to contain the blanket clutter near my favorite chair. I like to check email, read, er... fall asleep,,, in my favorite chair with a blanket - or two depending on the weather. The blankets always looked like clutter when I wasn't using them because they didn't have a home. This basket holds two extra fluffy, large throw size blankets with some room to spare. I put an extra phone charger in the bottom of the basket for the rare times I charge my phone while sitting there.The color is just what I expected from the listing and complements the space really well. The listing mentions that the basket comes folded and needs time to hold its shape. It is standing up fine with the blankets in it and I hope that the loose folds in the sides will relax in a few days.I can see this being used for throw blankets, stuffed animals, throw pillows, etc. Just what I was looking for, and the price was right, too. Recommended if the loose folds won't make you crazy.",
