Great for organizing, the hooks up top are thin which makes it easy for shutting the door. Easy to put together and you can use this for multiple uses. Behind a bathroom door to hold bathroom supplies, towels, feminine products. Inside a closet for socks, accessories etc. Or a babies room (like I used mine for) to organize toys, post partum items and more. LOVE this organizer!! Highly recommended \ud83d\udc4c \ud83d\udc4d",

I wasn't quite sure initially what to do with the second one. i ended up using it to store the linens for the guest bedroom and it was perfect (pictured). I may get another for my laundry roomit's very functional, great product for storage, so many uses.",
