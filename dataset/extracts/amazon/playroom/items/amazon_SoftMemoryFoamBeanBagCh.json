I put a throw pillow in the back and some cardboard on the sides to give it a little more shape and sturdiness but all in all it\u2019s exactly what was advertised in my opinion. id say it will fit until up to about 2 years old. the cover is also decent material and it\u2019s comfy, my fianc\u00e9 and i will lay on it sometimes.",

I've tried to manipulate it several ways to make it form into the cushion casing and I ha ent been able to get it to do so. Otherwise the fabric is nice.
