But since I don\u2019t have an IKEA close by I gave in to purchasing this one. It\u2019s really cute! So far has held up to my sons abuse. Was very easy to put together which is a plus. I did have some problems with a chair being wobbly but realized I needed to tighten all the legs a little more and fixed that.The chairs seem a little awkward for my son to sit in but that\u2019s okay, he will figure it out. Is on the shorter side but works for us. My 16 month old is in the 90th percentile and his feet barely touch the ground, he will get a couple years out of this table.",

                "reviewText": "I love this, with an exception. The table and chairs are so cute and extremely easy to assemble. However, I received a defective leg to a chair. The screw inside the leg was much shorter than all the others and wouldn\u2019t tighten. I reached out to Amazon and the only thing that could be done is me to return and it and them send a replacement. This is usually easy but my toddler had already watched us put it together and would have had an epic meltdown if we had taken it from her. So now I\u2019m having to get creative to try and assemble the other chair. It\u2019s great for the price but obviously isn\u2019t perfect.",
