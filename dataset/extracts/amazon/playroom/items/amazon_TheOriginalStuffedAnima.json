Great customer service and great product.**Original Review**I ordered two of these just a couple of days apart. One came with the hooks on the left, which work wonderfully. Hangs over the door and stays in place. Holds lots of stuffed animals. The hooks on the right fall off all the time and scrape the door frame. I\u2019ve put in a ticket with the seller so we\u2019ll see if I get a response and the correct hooks.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I really love this product! The quality is great - the bars that slide in the back give it great stability and sturdiness, the pockets are huge (plenty of room for the bigger squishmallows), and it\u2019s super easy to assemble. The only thing preventing it from getting five stars from me is the over the door hooks sometimes slide off if I\u2019m not careful when shutting the door. Not a huge deal, but wish there was something to keep them attached. The price is a bit steep too, but the quality really is great. And the customer service is wonderful!",
