                "reviewText": "I love Amazon, but I over research and overthink everything! The reviews seemed mixed on this one, but let me tell you- it\u2019s better than you\u2019re reading. I bought 2 of these. They do come in tiny little boxes. The fabric piece is wrapped separately and I had no issues with ripping/separating of the fabric- I checked before I even started. The foam comes all rolled in plastic and vacuumed packed. Once unrolled, I thought for sure it was gonna be a disaster. The instructions said it would take 24h for the foam to fully reinflate, but didn\u2019t say whether to put it together before or after the time passed. So I decided maybe it\u2019d be easier to do it before. It was awful- struggled to get the foam in place, and it looked so flimsy/flat when I finished. So I undid all my hard work and let the foam sit. Later in the day, the pieces didn\u2019t really look like they were perking up much (granted it hadn\u2019t been 24h yet). So I decided to try warming them with my hairdryer to see if the heat would expand the foam. Lemme tell ya, it was like magic and they filled in before my eyes. I then let them all sit until the next day for them to still expand on their own some more. When I went to assemble, it was SO MUCH EASIER once they were ready- almost like the piece just fit in the puzzle because it was exactly the size it needed to be instead of struggling with extra fabric on too small foam. They only part that was tricky for me was with the slanted pieces with the blue dots that need to line up. The instructions would say \u201cfacing-down\u201d and then say \u201cfacing-up\u201d and I got all sorts of confused. Basically, which ever way you\u2019re putting your pieces in, make sure that the blue dots that have the foam touching are gonna be on the upside when you have it out like a bed. The gap part from the slants should be down on the floor when the bed is out. Also, be careful when putting them in the fabric. So many reviews had ripped seams and torn foam and I think it was from being too rough. Take your time putting them in and gently putting the fabric where it needs to go and you\u2019ll save yourself a lot of frustration. The fabric does have a counting sheep pattern that was hard to see in the description pics, but they\u2019re really cute and not distracting. When fully put together, they were sturdy (for a foam couch) and comfy. The price was right for these compared to other brands. Are these gonna last 10 years? No. But for less than $50, you can have a comfy nap-place/book-reading couch (let\u2019s be honest, tablet-watching spot!) for 2-3years that you won\u2019t feel bad about tossing when it\u2019s time.",

You have to pay careful attention to the way the foam is inserted into the cover, and it's not intuitive or well marked. the foam can be removed for cleaning, and the cover is machine washable. Once you have a grasp of the way the inserts are aligned, it's not hard to put it back together correctly. There is no support other than the rigidity of the foam inserts, so anyone over about 50 pounds is going to crush it and it will be like sitting in a bean bag chair.",

The foam expanded within 5 minutes of being out of the wrapping. It was a little tricky to get the arm pieces to fit. It almost seems like both sides of fabric were an inch too short. I got it to fit though. Of course, it being foam, it won't hold its shape very well. One side is already very droopy after just 2 days. But, the kids love sitting on it, and actually prefer it folded out so they can also lay on it. I would buy this again.",
