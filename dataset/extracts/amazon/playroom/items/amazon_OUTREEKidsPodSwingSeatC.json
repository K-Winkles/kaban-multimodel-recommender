                "reviewText": "I purchased this swing for Christmas for my son who is autistic with sensory issues. He absolutely loves the swing but we discovered a few weeks after putting it up that the cushion which is inflatable and zips into the bottom of the swing was losing air slowly. We initially suspected that the nozzle must have been dislodged while he was swinging despite it appearing to be fully pushed in. At this point we have now had to refill it multiple times and within a couple of days it is partially deflated. We are outside of the return window and I contacted Amazon because I could not find any way to contact the seller to ask if they could send me a new inflatable cushion. Amazon informed me they had no seller contact information either and gave me a partial credit which was kind of them but I am very disappointed there's no way to reach the seller and also that the inflatable cushion is defective. He otherwise loves the swing and in every other aspect it is well-made. If the cushion is a one time defect I wish I could get another one rather than having to buy the entire swing again. I always considered a negative if you can't directly communicate with the seller. I have had very few times where I've needed to communicate with a seller despite using Amazon constantly for years but when there is no way to reach them it feels a little disconcerting.",
