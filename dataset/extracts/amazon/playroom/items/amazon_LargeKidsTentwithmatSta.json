                "reviewText": "This little house is so great. I put it together by myself, a mom with the help of my 4yo. No husband in sight! No tools needed and it is VERY sturdy. Not like a flimsy pop-up tent. This is constructed by snapping pipes together for the frame and then putting the cover around it. The instructions that came with it were perfect, and it only took about 15-20 minutes total.The floor mat is great. The material is thick. The windows and curtains are adorable.My favorite part is that it\u2019s so cute and matches my decor so well that i actually love having it in my living room! It\u2019s not an eyesore like most kids tents. My daughter loves it, I love it, and for the price, you really can\u2019t beat it. It\u2019s been such a fun addition to our home, and the sky is the limit as far as imaginative play!For size reference, my 4 year old can stand straight up in it, and she is 3\u20198\u201d. I can lay flat across the floor inside (I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d). It can fit a play kitchen, a dining area, or my whole family including the mini doodle \ud83e\udd23 if you\u2019re contemplating this, I promise you won\u2019t regret it. My absolute favorite thing my kids got for Christmas by far.Pictured with my 4yo for size reference.",

                "reviewText": "I am absolutely thrilled with this play tent! It deserves every single one of its five stars and more. The size of the tent is truly impressive \u2013 a whopping 52x35x52 inches \u2013 providing an enormous space that's perfect for kids to immerse themselves in imaginative role-playing and reading adventures. What's even more remarkable is that it can comfortably fit two children or even an adult, turning it into a magical space for the whole family.The standout feature for me was the ease of assembly. No tools are required, and I had the tent up and ready in no time. This means spontaneous playtime can happen anywhere, whether it's in the living room, the backyard, or a day out at the park. The convenience of being able to create a kids' paradise on the go is truly a game-changer.The choice of materials is commendable. The premium polyester fabric not only gives the tent a durable and sturdy build, but its fade-resistant color ensures it stays vibrant even after extended use. And let's face it, spills are inevitable with kids around. That's why the machine-washable feature is a godsend. No more worrying about chocolate milk mishaps or accidental soda spills \u2013 cleaning up is a breeze.I was pleasantly surprised to find that the package includes everything needed for an incredible playtime experience. The adorable play tent itself is just the beginning. The set of poles provided makes setup hassle-free, and the inclusion of star lights adds a touch of enchantment that every child will adore. The non-slip mat, generously sized to fit the bottom of the tent, is a thoughtful addition that ensures kids have a comfortable and safe space to play, read, and even take naps.As a parent, I'm always on the lookout for gifts that encourage creativity and imagination. This tent ticks all the boxes. With one door and three windows, complete with curtains for added privacy, it's a little haven where boys and girls can explore, entertain themselves, play games, and let their imaginations run wild. I'm convinced that this tent has the power to enrich children's minds and enhance their creativity.In summary, this play tent is an absolute gem. Its large size, ease of assembly, durable materials, and thoughtful inclusions make it an exceptional choice for kids of all ages. It's not just a tent; it's a gateway to a world of endless possibilities. I can confidently say that this is the best gift for kids that I've come across in a long time.",

                "reviewText": "Super cute and loverly tent for kiddos !! They loved it !! Easy to set up and sturdy enough for the kids plays. Nets and windows are good addition and kids love to peek from those. Added a small battery operated lantern for some excitement as well :) .Was able to fit in a good size crib mattress with ease but needed to pad it with some cushions. My kid has already kept their toys inside it and it's a toy home . So funny !! Looking for more fun and play time. Overall, super happy with this purchase and set up. Adding a picture for helping with how it looks overall. Enjoy!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a birthday gift for my 2 year old son. He loved it and my 3 year old loved it just as much. I put the string lights on the inside to give it some light in there and they loved that. The tassel provided wasn\u2019t long enough to attach to the top of the tent so I attached it inside to one of the pipes. I did have trouble putting it together at first because I hadn\u2019t really pushed on the pipes and was just putting them together, when I tried putting the cover on it wouldn\u2019t fit. I went back and read other reviews and read several that said to really push the pipes together, I went back over each pipe and gave it a good push and the cover fit like a glove! The front panel didn\u2019t fit the way I thought it would. It seemed like it would slide out but once I attached it all together, it wasn\u2019t an issue. It is huge, 2 adults and 2 toddlers fit in there with still some wiggle room! Overall, my boys love it and that\u2019s all that matters. Super cute and seems very sturdy and good quality so far! A great product for the price + the extras (tassel and lights) is a plus!",
