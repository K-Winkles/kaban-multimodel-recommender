My personal favorite features of this set includes the wooden storage box which should last a while and the wooden cutting board. I also love that it came with multiple knives as my son will surely lose them. I also love that these toys are wood because wood last a long time and is biodegradable. The food items are pretty cute too. Some of them feature felt accents like leaves and it\u2019s adorable. My son loves to chop up his vegetables and cook them on his fake stove/appliances (not included in this set). I like that the food adheres via Velcro. I think this set will last a long time depending on how rough my son is with it. The wooden parts probably won\u2019t break but I\u2019ve seen the Velcro eventually come off due to the constant pressure of \u201ccutting\u201d (but that was a different set, this set has yet to show signs of wear and tear).",

He is autistic and struggles with eating, smelling and even touching many different foods so I wanted to make food fun. He loves being able to chop the food with the knives - especially likes hearing the chop when the knife hits the board. By identifying different play food, I then introduce him to the \"real world\" food and have him try to name the different foods as we're in the grocery store. He does struggle with textures so he has a hard time when it comes to touching/chopping the real thing, but he is a bit more interested in learning and interacting with some foods (even if he has yet to eat it). As far as the play set itself, these are nice, solid quality pieces. We haven't had any issues with the velcro coming off or paint chipping. I also like that it comes with a wooden storage box that fits all of the pieces, although I wish it had a cover.",

                "reviewText": "A childhood kitchen needs little cutting foods. And this is a great beginner set! It comes with a nice variety of pretty good quality food and they\u2019re structured enough to where it really is a fun challenge to cut them apart. So the Velcro holds well enough to where it really does feel like you\u2019re cutting haha Yes - i tried these myself! Really a good set. No complaints!",
