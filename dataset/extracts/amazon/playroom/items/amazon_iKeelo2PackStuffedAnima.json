You can install in different rooms or create stackable units in one corner. What should I pay attention to before making a purchase? Installation may cause damage to the wall - drilling holes in the wall using a power drill is required. Installation dimensions: Requires min. 26-31 inches/65-80cm of corner space on each wall. Can we use adhesive hooks for the toy hammock? Yes, but the weight capacity of the hammock decreases with the maximum weight the hook can support. And please make sure that the adhesive hooks are well attached to the wall. How to remove the cotton odor of the toy hammock? Hand wash and hang dry can effectively reduce the cotton odor. Why choose us? a. Safe material that is free from Lead, Cadmium, and Phthalates b. Denser mesh allows for storing smaller-sized toys c. Metal rings + Sturdy knots + Thick rope provide better weight-bearing capacity",

The large squishmallow on the bottom hammock is a jumbo size, you could probably fit two jumbos per hammock if you wanted to. I had extra room behind the stuffed animals to store throw pillows as well. (Standard size, two on top and one on the bottom) I'm writing this on 01/11/2024, I've just put the hammock up today. I'll update if anything happens, but for now it seems sturdy and I'm very happy with them! I screwed the hooks into studs, so I did not need to use the drywall anchors.",
