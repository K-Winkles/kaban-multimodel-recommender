I thought I would try a spray this time and this set's price was right and the reviews were great. A few sprays on the microfiber cloth removed all of the grime from my screen easily and with no streaks! It also has a polishing cloth to be used after the cleaning solution. You get 2 (4oz) bottles, 2 microfiber cloths and 2 polishing cloths. Highly recommended.EDIT: I just noticed that the 2 little bags that hold the cloths are resealable! So convenient!",

                "reviewText": "I have over 2000 DVDs & Blu ray discs. I cleaned all of them and this is the 3rd cleaner that I bought. The first cleaner I used was from Walmart that I bought probably 20 years ago when I got glasses. When it ran out I bought another cleaner and I like it but I thought I should try others. Some of the items I bought smelled so bad that I returned them after the first spray!This one doesn't smell. It works well on the discs and on my glassed, smart phone screen, laptop screen and TV screen. It doesn't leave streaks, either. The cleaning cloths are great, too. Wash them before use to get some of the color off that bleeds. I wash them every night if I use them just so they are clean when I need to use them again.I've made it through almost all of my 2000 discs as well as cleaning all the blu ray cases. I was appalled at the greasy residue that is on the cases, thinking that since most of them were used when I bought them that the prior owners messed them up. But I also found the same residue on brand new cases. So, I went through all my Blu Ray cases as well as some of the DVD cases and cleaned them. I have used 5 bottles of cleaners so far.This brand is my 4th brand that I kept, and it rates as well as the others did. The most recent prior to this brand was Purity lens cleaner. It is very good as well. I don't remember the cost comparison between them so when I need to reorder, I will look at cost, if both brands are available.If you look online, some places tell you not to use lens cleaner on blu ray discs, but I haven't found any problems with the discs after cleaning with lens cleaner. I won't pay the prices they are asking for blu ray disc cleaner, as it is sometimes 4 times the cost of lens cleaner. I haven't tried making my own cleaner, but I might if I ever have to clean my whole collection again. Now, I am very careful to only touch the outer edge and inside the middle circle.",

                "reviewText": "I got 2 bottles and 4 cloths with this purchase, I use an app called roadie, in this app they have orders where you pick up prescriptions for people and take it to them. It's a great app but the part that I don't like is sick people signing my phone with their finger (I've tried using stylus pens but it never seems to work right). This product works excellent, takes all the finger prints off plus knock on wood I haven't gotten ill in some time and as a bonus it takes off all the fingerprint marks and leaves my screen looking as new as when I first bought it! I'd recommend this to everyone.",

I did not want to damage my screen so I saw this product and read the reviews and I saw it was super affordable. I just used this on my laptop and it works great I only needed a couple sprays and my screen was good as new. I would highly recommend for phone screens, Laptop and tv screens great and it comes with reusable wash cloths",
