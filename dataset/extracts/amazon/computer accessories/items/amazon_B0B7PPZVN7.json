It was my everyday mouse for designing but I had to switch to a backup small wireless mouse in a pinch. Of course it's out the return window by a couple weeks! It was cool looking but it's cheaply made and doesn't last !",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I like this mouse. It is reasonably priced, it is comfortable, has a large scroll wheel, and the adjustable resolution and colored lights are very nice. That said, there are a few issues that detract. First, it came with NO instructions. However, the product page has fairly complete photos, instructions, and tips, so you may want to save or print this information. For me, the forward-back buttons on the left side would be better if they were a little larger, spaced a little farther apart, and placed a little farther forward. There is a very tiny switch on the bottom, which is all but hidden within the confines of a label sticker, and which is used to switch between OFF and Bluetooth and Wireless modes. In addition to the switch being nearly invisible, it protrudes slightly below the bottom of the mouse. This could, over time, lead to scratching of softer surfaces, such as wood or vinyl, or result in wearing down the surface of the switch. I could not get the mouse to work in Bluetooth mode - it would connect, but would not function at all. It does work fine with the dongle in wireless mode. Finally, battery life is not the greatest - I have only achieved a max of two days use before having to recharge.",

                "reviewText": "First off, this mouse looks good. It's not heavy and easy to set up with the computer via dongle or bluetooth. That's where the positives end.This mouse uses a micro USB to charge. It's not a bad thing, but it's leaning towards archaic considering the options out there for its price point. The matted portions of the mouse are smooth to the touch, but the glossy plastic sections feel incredibly cheap. The biggest issue I have with it is the switch to turn the mouse on/off is too long. This causes the switch's sharp edges to rub against the mouse pad or desk mat. Over time, this scratching of the surface can result in wearing down the surface of the mat and cause tears. It sounds like it's scraping the surface of the mat and I'm worried it'll loosen the fibers of the mat and ruin it.It's not a bad mouse, but it would be better if the on/off switch wasn't so long.",
