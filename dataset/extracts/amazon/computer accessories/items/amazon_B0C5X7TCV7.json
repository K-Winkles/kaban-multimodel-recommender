With this it doesn't go to sleep. I don't have to do anything. I plugged it in and it comes on in single pixel mode and I just leave like that all day. I don't even turn it off when I am using it. For what I do, being 1 pixel off doesn't matter. I hardly notice it's there.",

Plug and play, as advertised. Button turns it on and off. I see some reviews where people are pissed that they turn it on, but can't continue to work because the mouse pointer is jiggling all over the place (seriously, that's their complaint). You don't use this while you're on your computer working. You use it when you're NOT actively working on the computer, but need your Teams status to show you're available. I've had mine for 3 years, no issues. It may be detectable by the IT department, but I would be happy to explain to IT, or anyone else, why I have it. I highly recommend.",

It has three modes, one that moves the mouse by just one pixel and back again about once a minute. One that moves the mouse a lot about once a minute. The last mode is simply off.This does it for me. I leave it plugged into a hub all the time where I can see the little indicator LED that tells me what mode it's in. Sure, I'm cheating the sleep timer, but that's really the whole point isn't it.",
