                "reviewText": "I am very happy with this choice to raise my monitors on my desk.Appearance-------------The stand looks nice. The brown faux-wood is very classy and the ebony black is modern, though the two together is a little bit weird. It looks very nice and matches my ebony black desk pretty well. It stands up on black feet and generally the whole stand is low profile. Again, love how classy it looks.Space-------------The stand is thin but long. This allows me to fit a 27' and a 24' monitor, though I did have to place them both at a tilt and the stands of my 27' monitor is just ever-so-slightly off of the stand. But it's in no way at risk of falling. It provides ample space if you have one monitor and plenty to spare. Two monitors like myself and you have to play a bit to get them to fit, but they'll fit. It also has good gaps for little stuff I always have at my computer.Setup-------------Straightforward directions, though I wasn't familiar with the turning screws that come included. Easy to get the pieces together -- took me about 15 minutes, and I'm slow at building.Overall------------Great expansion stand for adding deskspace and improving posture. Helps me not bend my neck down and sit straighter. I'd recommend the stand 100%. It's a 10/10 for the quality-price value.",

It's also the perfect height for a laptop or desktop computer. If you need to be staring at a screen all day (particularly if you're having any kind of on-camera virtual calls) you really need to have your computer at an ergonomical height. This is exactly what you want. And then it gives you some space to put things under it as well, which is nice.",

                "reviewText": "TL;DR - It is a great unit! Cut the four (4) supplied rubber pads in half to have enough to hit all the supports. Otherwise, center support will sag.Pros: Decided on this stand because it comes with a center vertical support most others do not. The stand is very sturdy and easy to assemble. It perfectly matches the wood look desk I ordered from a different vendor. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a wider vertical riser. I am currently using it with two 24\" monitors and there is plenty of room for them in horizontal configuration side by side.Cons: The only issue I have with the unit is they pack it with four (4) rubber pads. I placed them at the four corners of the outside supports, per the instructions. There were none supplied for the center support (which again, was the main reason I bought this particular unit was because it had the center support to prevent bowing). As it sits now with the rubbers pads installed, the foot of the center support sits about an 1/8th of an inch higher than the outside supports, which causes the center to bow with weight on it. I am going to the store to buy some extra pads and that will easily resolve the issue, but if I had known better at the time, simply cutting the supplied pads in half will give you plenty of pads to attach and alleviate the issue. There was nothing in the instructions mentioning this, but it would be my recommendation for anyone considering this unit. It was the only reason I deducted a star. If you are not planning to use the rubber pads, this is a non-issue.Note to manufacturer: The two remedies to this situation would be to: A. Include 2 extra pads so all contact points are covered with full size pads, or B. Write in the instructions to cut the 4 pads in half, thereby creating enough pads for the whole unit without adding extra pads/cost.",
