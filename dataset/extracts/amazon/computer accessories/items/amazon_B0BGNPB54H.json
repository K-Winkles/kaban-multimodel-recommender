I wanted a whole color scheme of green (my favorite color) and thought that it is well made. With typing all day I needed some padding and I can say the memory foam type texture is VERY comfortable! They also have a pad for your hand when using the mouse (which I use everyday) and even comes with a super cute placement for your coffee or drink of choice. 10/10 recommend. Perfect! I wanted to add some comfort and flair to my desk and this set is the perfect touch! It even matches my keyboard. It\u2019s soft and easy to clean. This is important because of my many spilled coffees. Great Mousepad set It really spruced up my desk. Lays perfectly flat and it's color is a lot better than the picture.",

I opted to take it into the office instead of returning and I\u2019m glad I did!The quality is great. The mat seems to repel water, so it\u2019s not soaking up the condensation from my morning drink and soaked all day when I forget to leave my drink on the coaster!I wasn\u2019t sure that I\u2019d like the wrist support, especially by the mouse but when I\u2019m at a desk without it now, I miss it! The quality is fantastic, with a grippy lining underneath so it stays in place even on a slick desk surface. The colors are vibrant and beautiful as pictured. The price is great for what is included, large desk mat, keyboard wrist support, mouse wrist support and a coaster!",

There is also a small imperfection (shown in last pic). It's big enough to cover most of the desk and good value for all you get. Padding is nice and thick.
