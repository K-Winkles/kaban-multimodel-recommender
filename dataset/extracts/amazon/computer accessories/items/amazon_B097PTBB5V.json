This is a good charger to buy as a back up.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a travel alternative charger for my ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16, as well as for my Canon R6 Mark II. It works well for both of them and charges the devices really quickly. Not many chargers work with Canon R6 Mark II, but this one works well. The original ASUS charger adapter is 240W, vs. this one that is 118W, so it will be understandably slower than the ASUS one, and it gets a bit hot, but if you want to save space for traveling and charge your gaming laptop, it is a great option. When compared to the original ASUS charger, this one is much lighter (200 g vs 660 g) and twice smaller and less bulkier considering cables, so it is great for traveling.",
