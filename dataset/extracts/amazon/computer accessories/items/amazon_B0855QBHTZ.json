                "reviewText": "I needed something to lift these screens up to eye level. With my monitor and laptop just sitting on the table alone, my posture was suffering. When looking down at the screens, It's like my body involuntarily wants to lean in closer to them, thus causing me to have that unsightly hump in my back. That's a no go! Even with looking at the measurements of the stands before buying them, i wasn't sure if three inches lifted off the table would be enough. I was pleasantly surprised once assembled. It was just enough to keep me from leaning forward. I think the nice little storage spaces underneath are nice too. Turned my table into a nice little workstation :)Assembly was easy, took about 20 -30 mins. May even take you less time honestly. Not much to put together. I saw in a review of the wood cracking where you are to screw the pieces together. That person must have really put a lot of force into over tightening because the individual pieces are tough. Don't over tighten and you should not have any problems.Functionality-As i said before, it puts the screens at eye level for me. I guess this also depends on the height of your own desk/table, your height, and the height of your chair. There's also the two swivel pieces that are to enable the swivel function should you choose to install them. I preferred not to install them as installing them will limit how far you can adjust the length of the stands. Not installing them has not diminished the integrity of the stands in any way and they can still \"swivel\". It's sturdy so far and i don't see it falling apart anytime soon. I included a picture using one of the slots for an ipad so you can see how it looks but i haven't used it for that until writing this review.I'd recommend. Inexpensive. Easy to assembly. Does not feel cheap. Does what it advertises. No more hunchback for me!",
