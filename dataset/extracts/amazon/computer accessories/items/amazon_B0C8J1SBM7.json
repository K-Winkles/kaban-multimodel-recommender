They don't hold very well and the velcro's not that strong. The mesh cable ties for the best part of it and I used every single one of them, the black sticky plugs. You can stick on sides of furniture or desks. Throws work really well and the other black ones. I used a couple of those but all of the velcro ones to me were utterly useless. I used a couple of them and some of them kept coming undone but the hard plastic ones and the ones with the hard plastic and the adhesive backings and the mesh black tubes. That's the only way I can describe them. Those were excellent and they also give you several other pieces to use but some of them were way too small for some of my needs. I may use some of the others later and it is a good value, but I think they should have given you more of the black mesh tubes and a lot less of the velcro strips because the velcro strips didn't work that well again. Otherwise for $15 it wasn't that bad",
