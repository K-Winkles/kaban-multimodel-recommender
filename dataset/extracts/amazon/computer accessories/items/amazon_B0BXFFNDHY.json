The only issue: The magnetic pen/accessory holder on the side of the organizer has come unglued in under 48 hours from installation. I came in this morning to see my pens and pencils all over the floor. So...it has one job and it's not doing so hot. I'll try gluing it in with a more appropriate adhesive to see if I can repair it vs it ending up in the landfill, but other buyers should beware it's not using an industrial adhesive like VHB or similar.",

It is ventilated to let your laptop breathe and cool off. It easily attaches to a desktop with regular thickness. Before buying, look under your desk and see if you have a few inches of free space with no brackets getting in the way. The price is not cheap so keep an eye out for sales, but considering you are using it for an expensive piece of computer hardware isn't it worth the investment? I would buy another unit. Highly recommend!",
