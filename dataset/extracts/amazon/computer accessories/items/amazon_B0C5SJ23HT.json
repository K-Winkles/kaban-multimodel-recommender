A damaged disc may scratch the screen. Please replace it with a new disc.DO NOT remove the plastic disc at the end of the tip, or the tip won't work.

It works perfectly to edit videos and photos, and even write notes with ease on the android phone I have. However, the material is very smooth, making it extremely easy to drop. I would have liked for it have a clip on it, like real pens have, so I can slip it into a pocket or bag and not loose place of it. Having said that, the experience with it is good.",

The precision and options are fabulous for texting gaming. Rubber tips seem more durable as well and a bit more stiff allowing a better experience. Like them so much I repurchased so have them available in car, purse, wherever I might use and have backups :-) very happy",

When I came across this one, I thought I'd give it a try. It doesn't disappoint, not only did I get two but I love that it came with extra tips for when these get worn out. Works on iphone, ipads, computers. I loved it so much I ordered a set for myself and then ordered another set to give as a gift. Highly recommended!",
