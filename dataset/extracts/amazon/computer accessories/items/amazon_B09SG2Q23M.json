I got the white one and it blends in perfectly and there are so many outlets to use and spaced so far apart I got all of my computer and accessories and other appliances in my office plugged into this one outlet very easily with plenty of room and plenty of extra outlets to use in the future. . I love the 2100J surge protection that I get with this power strip, and I like the way it plugs into the wall flat.. it seems silly to get excited about a power strip, but I am it looks so nice and works so well if I could give it six stars I would!! And Anker is good stuff! I\u2019m very happy with this product!!",

                "reviewText": "Update: I originally gave this a 1-star after my surge protector's USB ports failed. However, customer service was kind enough to assist me with this and provided me with a new one. So far, I have used the new one for about 2 weeks, which has worked fine so far, so I updated it to 4 stars. If it fails sooner than expected, I will update again accordingly.This surge protector has a very nice compact form factor, including the presence of USB-C and two USB-A ports, which are the reasons I bought it to replace one which had served me well for nearly 20 years.Unfortunately, they have become unreliable after a month, literally a day after my return window expired. While the manufacturer does state that there is insufficient power to use USB-C with the USB-A ports simultaneously, this no longer has the juice to even power USB-A by itself. I expected much better from Anker.",
