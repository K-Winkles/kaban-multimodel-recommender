Only time will tell.But, when you compare the cost of canned air to this product, this item is much more economical. Plus, it also provides a vacuum function with the use of HEPA filtration.",

                "reviewText": "This won't even turn on after only having it for 5 months with very little use.I was never impressed with the suction/blowing- but for the price, I didn't expect it to. Unfortunately, after having it for only 5 months where I only used it maybe once or twice a week for vacuuming up debris on my desk as needed, the one I ordered died and won't turn on/can't be recharged.I was hoping to find warranty information to replace it as I still have the box, but there isn't a way to contact the brand for a replacement option. I understand that products don't always hold up, but I could have just spent a small amount more for a product that had/has a product guarantee. Now, if I want to replace this one, I have to buy a new one altogether.This seemed like a great investment when I first got it- but after barely using it for the last few months, I'm mostly disappointed with my purchase. It was really loud to use, the attachments were cheap and too big to use for most of the applications I wanted to use it for, and it clearly isn't built to last.I would recommend getting something with an actual warranty instead of buying this.",

                "reviewText": "I was not sure if this would really get the job done. I have to say after using it about 10 times thus far I am very impressed. I was expecting it to feel cheap and lightweight. Its a very solid device. It comes with 3 filters but it would be nice to know where you can order more.The device is a bit loud but its a vacuum so I don't see how that is avoidable. I has a fair amount of power and really does a great job at picking up stuff. If you are like me and you eat at your desk, you need this.The attachments are very helpful. The canister is clear so you can see all the stuff being picked up. The canister fights tight and you can remove the filter without issue.The blowing side is equally impressive. The tools provided for that side do a great job at directing the airflow for cleaning the inside of your PC.The charging cable is USB-C but it is an extended plug. I think its like 10mm but its longer than the standard phone cable. You can get these off Amazon without issue. You can also get adapters so if you lose the cable its not a big deal. There is a charge light. I would not recommend charging using your PC. Use like a 2 or 3amp adapter.I will probably get these as gifts for Xmas.",

                "reviewText": "The Compressed Air Duster & Mini Vacuum Keyboard Cleaner 3-in-1 offers a combination of convenience and functionality, but it comes with a few drawbacks.On the positive side, the portability of this cleaning kit is a definite plus. The compact design makes it easy to carry around, and the dual functionality of compressed air and mini vacuum adds versatility to the cleaning process. It's suitable for a quick cleanup of keyboards and other electronic devices.However, the effectiveness of the compressed air might leave something to be desired. While it works reasonably well for light dusting, tackling more stubborn debris or particles can be a challenge. The mini vacuum, though handy, also has limitations, especially when dealing with larger particles.The cordless feature is a double-edged sword. While it enhances mobility, the battery life could be a limiting factor for more extensive cleaning sessions. A longer-lasting battery would greatly improve the overall usability of this 3-in-1 cleaner.In terms of build quality, the materials used feel a bit flimsy, raising concerns about durability over time. The longevity of the device might be questionable under regular use, especially for those looking for a long-term cleaning solution.In summary, the Compressed Air Duster & Mini Vacuum Keyboard Cleaner 3-in-1 has its merits, especially for quick and portable cleaning tasks. However, its limitations in dealing with more challenging cleaning scenarios and concerns about durability bring it down to a middle-of-the-road rating.",

Everything else about this was wonderful!!!I live in a desert, so dust is a neverending struggle, and especially for a gamer, it is a PC killer! However, first I used the vacuum side, then switched to the blower side, and between the two, my entire PC internally looks nearly new! The brush attachments all worked wonderfully! Good strong suction! Blow power is actually better than most cans of compressed air I've used...without a can getting cold in your hand and/or the extra liquid from those cans leaving residue on my electronics! I cannot say enough good things about this 3-in-1!!!",

It only works on the suction side. I learned that I think it's a great little vacuum. I was surprised how long the charge lasted on it",
