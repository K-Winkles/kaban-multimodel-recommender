It has all the features of the real pro controller (gyro, wake from controller, solid joysticks, USB-C charging) with the bonus of cool LEDs, extra buttons, and an on/off switch for rumble.Only differences I see is it's a bit more lightweight, the buttons don't feel as premium but they still feel good, the home button is moved to accommodate turbo so you have to get used to that. Also, the listing says it's a 1000mah battery but the controller sticker says 800.It's really pretty, the design of the stars is unreal. So easy to pair, so easy to use, highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: We have had near on a full month of use. Controller still working ok. Its about 50/50 if it will wake the system, but that is a problem with all wireless 3rd party we notice (and think its the problem of the switch we have). The light feel still taking some getting use to, and after using it a while, we wish the buttons lit up. The controller light is AMAZING, nice colors and vibrant, but because of this, having NOTHING under the buttons its hard to see them at times. Battery seems to charge fast, and hold a good amount of time, and as of right now, we have had no problem with input lag or lose of connection. All in all, really get this controller for a lover of glowing controllers, stars, or that needs a lighter weight controller for their hands.If you are thinking of getting a cute light up wireless rumble controller for switch, just do it. This thing is CUTE. Easy to set up and use right out of the box! The light is bright and has a nice shift of color when left on the rainbow option.The only complaints, and these are personal problems....- It is a LIGHT controller. This sucker is over an ounce lighter then a pro controller, enough that you can feel the lack of weight. This makes it feel cheap made, but that isn't the case. (from what testing we did)- The arms do have some texture grip to them, this does feel odd and might be off putting to those that have a texture issue.- the Joy sticks are concave in, giving an odd feeling. Your fingering isn't slipping off, but it makes the sticks feel a touch too short? This was easily fixed with some cute planet themed joystick nubs.",

                "reviewText": "I'll admit I was a little afraid when I first saw the box this came in; it was a little plain looking so I was afraid I might have ended up with a super cheap knock off, but I'm so glad I was wrong!This controller is a nice weight in my hands, not to heavy but not too light either; it feels quite nice to hold when playing games. It has all the functions of a brand-name Nintendo pro controller for the Switch (except for an amiibo reader as far as I've seen unless I'm completely missing it on this thing) plus the buttons for Turbo button actions, vibration power, and switching up the color of the lights.Speaking of the lights, it's absolutely GORGEOUS when it's lit up. I'm a sucker for stars, galaxies, and other kinds of prints and lighting so when I saw it was just as vibrant in person with it's rainbow shifting stars against it's pretty black and blue sky paint, I was so happy. There's multiple options for the lights like your typical RGB lighted devices but I like sticking with the original rainbow setting. And after many weeks with it, I can also confirm it does just as good of a job connected to my computer as well as my phone, surprisingly.Overall, I'm absolutely pleased with this purchase and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a nice switch controller for once those Joy-cons need to charge and might be looking for a pro controller that isn't too expensive. The quality of this controller is amazing for the price I paid and it's been wonderful to use.",

The glow is super bright and the design is gorgeous. The controller feels perfect and functions well. (We play alot of Mario kart and get joy stick drift every time). Would 100% recommend this one.",

If you have to run away to do chores or anything it automatically turns off, which is nice for parents chasing down toddlers. It doesn't feel cheep or anything like that.I had a problem with powerA controllers just completely dying on me within 3 months of use, with complete battery burnout even though I wasn't playing every day. Will update to see if this has the same issue.",

I bought this as a replacement, the Joycons are a bit too tiny for my hands, and I was really surprised. It feels like a cheaper alternative (rougher plastic, sortof sticky controls at first) but after using it for a day it seemed to loosen up and proved to be a nice little controller. I beat Hollow Knight in its entirety with it (and beat the alt ending bosses) so I'm gonna give it 5 stars. No drift, no issues with any of the buttons or battery life. Looks beautiful. Great alternative to the Pro controller for like half the price. Would be great for kids or just casual gaming.I still was able to dunk on children in Fortnite with ease and I'm 35 so my life is basically over. 10/10",

Ich besitze einen Nintendo Pro Controller und einen 8Bito Pro Controller. Ich habe also etwas vergleichbares gesucht, was aber weit weg von 60 - 70 Euro ist. Ich habe diesen f\u00fcr knappe 30\u20ac bekommen und was soll ich sagen, f\u00fcr den Preis ist er nahezu perfekt. Deshalb hier einmal kurz was mir gef\u00e4llt und was nicht.Positiv:Das wichtigste! Der Controller weckt die Switch zuverl\u00e4ssig und schnell auf. Das ist wunderbar.Sehr gute VerarbeitungErgonomie eines Pro ControllersGuter TastendruckProgrammierbare Backpaddels.Bewegungssteuerung (funktioniert wie es soll)Rumble (ist v\u00f6llig OK und l\u00e4st sich einstellen)Die Beleuchtung ist super und l\u00e4sst sich spielend \u00e4ndern und auch ausstellen.Negativ:Die Backpaddels sind sehr laut vom Klickger\u00e4usch her.Die Sticks f\u00fchlen sich etwas tr\u00e4ge an im Vergleich zum Pro oder 8BitoEr f\u00fchlt sich etwas kleiner an und etwas zu leicht.(Kann bei Kindern auch in den positiven Abschnitt)Die Turbobelegumg und die Tastenprogrammierung hab ich nicht ausprobiertEs ist ein sch\u00f6ner Controller der den sehr teuren Switch Controllern in nicht viel nachsteht. Ich habe gesehen das er zum Teil f\u00fcr etwa 20 \u20ac gehandelt wird und dann ist er definitiv ein absoluter nobrainer.",

                "reviewText": "Ich habe einmal einen originalen Pro Controller, einmal einen den hier gezeigten Star-Controller und einmal den NS009-S.Alle liegen gut in der Hand, die Druckpunkte der Kn\u00f6pfe sind angenehm und die Stickbewegungen werden perfekt angenommen. Mit allen 3 Modellen kann ich die Switch aufwachen lassen. Somit sind die Grundfunktionen gegeben.Die Rumble-Funktion muss ich offen sagen, ist an dem originalen Pro Controller am sch\u00f6nsten, wesentlich feiner als bei den Zubeh\u00f6r Controllern. Bei den Zubeh\u00f6r Controllern ist der Rumble etwas gr\u00f6ber aber nicht st\u00f6rend. Einfach nur anders wie beim Original.Zum Gewicht: Original 246gramm, Lila Star 202gramm und der wei\u00dfe NS009-S 179gramm. Bez\u00fcglich des Gewichts ist das Sternenmodell genau mittig und somit wirklich nicht zu schwer oder zu leicht.Preise: Original 60 bis 70 \u20ac, Lila Star knapp \u00fcber 20\u20ac und der wei\u00dfe 11,23 \u00fcber eine andere bekannte g\u00fcnstige Plattform.Meine Kaufempfehlung: Alle 3 sind gut. Entscheidender ist wohl, was m\u00f6chte man ausgeben. Der wei\u00dfe Controller ist mein schlechtestes Modell, aber er macht trotzdem Spa\u00df und ist absolut gut spielbar. W\u00fcrde ihn also auch nochmal kaufen. Der Original Controller: ja, nat\u00fcrlich klare Kaufempfehlung, allerdings auch recht teuer. Der Lila Star: Auch absolute Kaufempfehlung: Druckpunkte sind gut, Rumble funktioniert und ist einstellbar,leider etwas gr\u00f6ber wie beim Original, Beleuchtung funktioniert und ist einstellbar. Weitere Funktionen brauche ich dann auch nicht mehr.Mein Fazit: klarer Favorit ist der Lila Star-Controller, optisch und spielerisch einfach perfekt.",

You can also change the lighting on the front, which is a nice feature. I was concerned that the lighting on the front might be distracting, however my concerns were unfounded once I started playing.It connects via Bluetooth and it just works. Like, I didn't need to do anything to set it up. And it works great, no lag on input, and the sticks don't seem to have any dead zone.It's sturdy enough that I feel confident giving it to my five year old, though it obviously won't handle being thrown about. That said, it's so cheap if I do have a dark souls related gaming disaster I can replace it.",
