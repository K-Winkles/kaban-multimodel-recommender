I love that it has lots of plug outlets and the design allows you to use small or large cords without them getting in each other way. The light on the top is fun, but not really neededWhile the spin is a nice concept, once you have cords plugged in it becomes pointless. You can't spin the tower at this point or all of the cords just get mixed up. Because this is upright, heavy cords can start to fall out and it can be bulky if you are plugging cords in to all sides.This really is ideal for a table where you have people from both sides wanting to plug into things - it's not really great when everything is going the same direction.",

The extra plug-ins are also helpful when I need to pull out my big, clunky 1980s calculator. I have had no issues using this and recommend it to everyone!I plan on bringing this on my next work trip; in the last year, I have stayed at a few hotels that did not have working USB ports.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good power strip that can really help organize your plugs.Pros:Lots of plugs as well as six USB connections on one side.The cord can be pulled out or retracted to use as much or as little of it as needed.It has lights on the top....a switch for on/off, white light, or changing colored lights, if needed.Cons:It's big! It might organize plugs but it will also be a large item wherever you set it down. With traditional surge protectors you can hide them a bit. This one you can't.Because the plug outlets are all facing one way, if you have plugs the face different directions you are limited in how to use them. It might result in blocking some of the outlets.Larger plugs, like MacBooks, probably need to be near the bottom so they don't work themselves out because of their weight.It is very useful, but it's also very bulky.",

                "reviewTitle": "Unique design of a power strip with AC and USB ports",
                "reviewText": "The TECMIZE Power Bar has a unique design compared to a traditional power strip. Instead of being flat, it is a Tower with a rotating base (with anti-slip pads) which has a builtin 6.5 foot thick retractable power cable with a flat plug on the end which saves space when plugged in a wall socket and has a light on top which doubles as a lamp.The tower itself has 4 sides, 3 of which have 5 standard US AC ports, the 4th has a switch on top for the light, 6 USB ports and an On/Off Power switch on the bottom.The light switch options are.Auto: Light alternates Red, Green, Blue Provides an ambient color lightOff: Turns light off No lightOn: White light always on Acts as a desktop lampTotal of 6 USB ports:2 x USB-C Fast Charging PD ports- Supports Max 30W on one port at a time4 x USB-A ports- Each USB port delivers 12W (5V 2.4A) charging power- Supports Max 12W on one port at a time which is more than double traditional 5W phone chargedTotal power output of 30W (4.2A) for all 6 USB ports (each port would get 5W and .7A when all 6 are simultaneously used, if I understand this correctly). So basically you can simultaneously charge 6 USB devices, but the power output will be shared with all devices connected. It would probably be a good idea to actually use the USB power adapters that came with your devices and connect these in the AC ports of the tower to get simultaneous fast charging. I would use the builtin USB ports to charge smart watches, earbuds, portable speakers etc. small devices that only come with USB cables and no power adapters.As for the 15 AC ports, this is the most I\u2019ve ever seen in a power type strip. Would I actually use all of these with cables connected, answer is probably no as it would make a cable mess if not properly organized and it would depend what is connected not to use too much power and cause an Overload Protection. Many times AC power adapters will overlap to another plug rendering it useless, so the total amount would probably not be 15 usable AC ports.I would see myself placing this at the back of my desk area with the main section of power switches and USB ports facing forward, and connecting 5 devices on the back with cables in the AC ports to hide the cables and the two other sides with 5 AC ports each with some used with AC power adapters for various devices. Always making sure when everything is connected and in use that not too much power us being used.Specifications of the product state:The 1875W rated power copper core cable allows all the outlets and USB ports to simultaneously work without a break. The charging tower built-in smart control overload protector will automatically switch off the power to keeping your devices out of harm\u2019s way. Has Builtin surge protection up to 900Joule, 10A 18AWG heavy duty wire, guaranteed to be of high security on charging devices with an overload protection smart control.If an overload protection were to happen with a computer connected or Internet router connected it would cause problems, so personally, important equipment should be connected apart in a separate wall AC outlet not to lose power.It is an interesting Power type strip, that should be used correctly.",
