                "reviewText": "It's exactly what it looks like. It's a small case about the size of a large wallet (much easier to find than a flash drive). It holds up to 12 flash drives and it comes with labels. In fact it comes with enough to label everything twice over, or to label both the flash drive and the case (to make them correspond), or in case you screw up the first label. The material feels like thick neoprene, so it will absorb plenty of shock if you drop it, making it even less likely to damage your flash drives in case of a tumble.Cons: It had a bit of a neoprene chemical smell when first opened that has faded into almost non-existence.So you may need a few days to air it out.It didn't bother me, but that's the only drawback I could think of for the product...TLDR:PROS: Matches picture and description 100% Easier to find than a flash drive Carries 12 drives Comes with 24 labelsCONS: Slightly smelly at first.",

                "reviewText": "I have several thumb drives stored in mine. It works very well. But there are just a couple things I would \"tweak\" to get to a 5-star rating: 1) The elastic that holds the drives in place is too wide. If you have numbers, etc. on your thumb drives like I do, you can't really see them without pulling each one out a ways to see it fully. I think maybe the elastic piece could be a little narrower to see more of the drive. 2) The case is made of neoprene (or similar) which is a tough, forgiving fabric. But it's not real rigid. This means that when you unzip this, it's kind of \"floppy\". There is enough give in the side walls that the neoprene strips, even though they're wide, can't hold the flatter drives in place real well. They just want to slide out. For \"fatter\" drives, like the folding kind, etc. there's no trouble. But for skinny ones, they want to slide out and fall if you're not careful.So a very good case overall. I would buy it again. I'm just calling out a couple things that keep it from being a 5-star rating (for me)",

The case is compact and professional-looking.Regular-size flash drives fit perfectly, and the stretchable fabric holders are tight enough to keep even mini flash drives in place. The only thing that isn\u2019t excellent about this product is the labeling system; neither the supplied labels nor regular tape stick well to the fabric; however, I discovered that good old-fashioned file-folder labels (cut to half-width) not only fit perfectly, but also stick to the fabric really well (see photo)!I also have to mention that this seller has fantastic customer service. When I was leaving seller feedback for a few other products, either Amazon or I had a glitch \u2014 somehow, the 1-star feedback I meant for another seller got attached to this seller by mistake. Within a matter of hours, this seller contacted me through Amazon to ask how they could make things right. That\u2019s what I call responsive! You\u2019re gonna love this case, but on the off-chance you don\u2019t, this seller is responsive and quick!5 stars.",

While secure file drops are handy, they don't offer the same verifiable delivery that a USB stick in a paper docs package does, so these sticks were called into that service. I was able to easily write and verify the files to the sticks. and have received no reports of inability to read them from the audience.I can't comment on speed or durability, as we did no testing. These are simple, worked well for our purpose, and seem a great value. I will share that were were wildly conservative on storage capacity, with less than 5GB used by the files package. But looking at similar but lower-capacity drives, the incremental costs to upgrade to 32GB are negligible. We still have a few left to use for other things, and perhaps we'll stretch to use more of their capacity another time.We are happy with the purchase, good product delivered on time, no errors reported. Just what we were looking for.",
