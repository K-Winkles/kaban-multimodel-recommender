If it breaks or stops working for any reason, I will update.Obviously, the player Apple uses to view video files will not play every type of file. .mkv files won't play for instance on my I Pad. If you had an .mkv file - for example - convert it to a file type that works - like mp4. Many websites online provide this service for free.Also, the unique plug Apple has for all it's devices are prone to need of regular replacement. This type of cord more often than other cables no longer function after only a few months with cheap cords... and this is a very cheap cord. Once plugged into your Apple device, I wouldn't recommend not unplugging and plugging back into. And, when the plug no longer functions, the entire product here will become useless.",
