                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Overall rather a fine little device, though just one or two little issues were perhaps overlooked.",
                "reviewText": "This thing sucks.It also blows.And the internal battery means you can make use of its sucking and blowing anywhere, without even the requirement of any physical attachments. It even comes with it's own protection in the form of two separate filters that fit inside the primary sucking attachment.The various accessories allow it to be employed regardless of the size of what you need sucked or blown.It should be noted that, while some moisture seems inconsequential, it seems designed for relatively dry loads.Battery life is something like 15 minutes per charge which, while not phenomenal, seems sufficient to get any single job done. Recharging is pretty fast - half an hour or less seems to fully charge it from a depleted state.Suction power I'd describe as fine - it feels neither particularly overpowered nor underpowered for most situations. It's a fine little sucker for most messes I can reasonably anticipate, but the trailer hitch is staying possessed of all its chrome, and the golf ball is staying at the other end of the garden hose.The attachments seem designed for only one end or the other - it moves air in but a single direction, and the distinction between sucking and blowing is made by turning the device around in the hand, and simply using the other end. There are several attachments, though each one seems designed to fit only one end of the device - a single attachment isn't used for both sucking and blowing. That said, the attachments provided seem sufficient for most jobs.The only situation in which I expected to use it but couldn't was on an inflatable toy I wanted to use. The attachments with nozzles small enough to seal the hole seemed to seat themselves snugly only in the suction end of the device, making it useful for DEFLATING inflatable objects, but not so much for INFLATING them.But as for what must be its most intended use, as a small hand vac for minor dry spills or cleaning out keyboards or the dust inside cases not often opened, it works very well.In short, while it doesn't quite do EVERYTHING I expected, it's still plenty useful and I'm glad to have it. It cleans up crumbs, dust, and even many cat hairs, taking care of the whole mess without needing another charge. I'm glad I bought it, and I expect to get my money's worth out of if it. However, though hardly critical, it would be nice if I could also use it to inflate things.",

                "reviewText": "I mainly got this to be a duster/blower for electronics. It works extremely well for that. The battery life is ok, it will net you about 15 min or so of continuous cleaning. Suction is good enough to vacuum a desk, and that's about it. It doesn't have much room, and the filter clogs kinda quick. It's also a bit loud, it will drown out anyone near you that's talking. But, it does the job and it charges via USB-C, which is why I got it. It works really well with the included brush tip for blowing out computers and phones.",

                "reviewText": "I've previously always used compressed air dusters to clean my mechanical keyboard and getting all the dust and debris out of it, as it builds up quite a lot over time. However, I found this when looking for an alternative as compressed air comes to around the same price for a pack of 4 or 5, except this product obviously can last a lot longer.Pros: I never have to buy another compressed air canister again as it's recharageable. This does the job well, coming with different heads for separate speeds. It also functions as a vacuum, as you just need to swap to the other side, giving it an additional use case, such as for cleaning debris on car seats.Cons: It's definitely not as strong as the compressed air canister, but it gets the job done.Overall, I decided to keep this product over buying more canisters as it's going to save me money in the long run. The slower speed is still enough to serve it's primary purpose and it also doesn't take as much space as multiple canisters.",

With the end for suctioning--it does not allow me to get in the tight spots I need to due to the flat squared end, so very disappointed in that. I can get it close, but not enough! Other than that-no complaints, it works as advertised, and works well. Just needs more than one attachment for the suction part!",
