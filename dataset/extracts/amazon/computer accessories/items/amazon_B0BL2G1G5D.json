                "reviewText": "After using the StepLively foot rest, I can confidently say that it has made a significant impact on my overall comfort and well-being while working long hours. This ergonomic footrest is designed to provide fatigue and pain relief, and it has lived up to its promise.The memory foam construction of the footrest is an excellent feature, as it conforms to the natural shape of my feet, providing customized support. This has been particularly helpful in reducing pressure on my legs and lower back, allowing me to maintain a better posture throughout the day. As a person suffering from sciatica, this is such a godsend!The non-slip bead on the base of the footrest ensures that it stays in place even when I need to adjust my position. This has been a valuable addition, as it eliminates the need to constantly reposition the footrest, ensuring that it is always where I need it to be.The washable cover is another thoughtful feature of the StepLively foot rest. Not only does it maintain a clean and professional appearance, but it also allows me to keep the footrest hygienic with ease. The black color of the cover makes it versatile enough to fit in any office, home, or gaming environment.One aspect to consider is that the footrest may not be suitable for those with larger feet, as its size could be limiting for some users. However, for the majority of users, the size should be more than adequate.In conclusion, the StepLively foot rest has been an excellent addition to my workspace, providing comfort, pain relief, and support during long workdays. The memory foam, non-slip bead, and washable cover are practical features that make this footrest a valuable investment. Whether you're working from home, in an office, or enjoying gaming sessions, this footrest is a great option for improving your overall experience.",

                "reviewText": "Was really skeptical at first with some of the mixed reviews, but was only a matter of allowing the product some time outside of its original packaging to transform into its actual shape. It\u2019s packaged tightly so of course it needs time to fluff up, and once it does, it\u2019s just like the picture. The foam is super soft & the anti-slip bottom is great. For the price, it\u2019s worth it. I highly recommend.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Supports better seated posture",
                "reviewText": "UPDATING TO ADD: I ordered the wider version because of how antsy I am when seated, and it's perfect! As noted in my original review, nothing wrong with the narrower version, it just turns out I move around a bit more and the wider version works better for me. All other positive attributes noted below still apply to the wider version.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Because I am short, I *just* barely can't touch the floor while seated in my desk chair, leading to all kinds of posture issues and achey knees/hips/back.Now, I can comfortably rest my feet securely on this foot rest, which makes a huge difference for my comfort while seated.I work from home, so I also get to use this without shoes, and the biggest surprise is how delightfully comfy this rest is to dig my toes into throughout the day! I find myself stretching my feet and ankles throughout the day more, and it feels really good.Only downside is not the fault of the foot rest: I am apparently a physically restless person, and find myself moving around enough that I wish I'd bought the wider version (so I wouldn't have to keep moving the foot rest around to keep up with my restlessness).For me, the foot rest stays where I put it, it's comfortable, and it's easy to adjust under my desk throughout the day.I'm honestly baffled that it took me this long to realize how useful a foot rest would be!I think some reviews note an odor right when the package is unsealed (mine came verrrrry vacuum sealed), and I did too right when I opened it; I chalked it up to just what foam normally smells like, and I didn't find it objectionable. Anyway, after letting the foam expand from being compressed and airing out for a day, I do not detect any residual odor, and the size and shape are exactly as shown in the images.",

                "reviewText": "Put it under my desk to provide some foot support and occasionally switch leg position as sitting in the normal 90-degree angle can get tiresome. It is wrapped in a vacuum-sealed package to save space and expands upon opening. I was disappointed with the height as I thought the footrest would be slightly higher. However, over time I got used to it and I come to use it everyday at my home desks. It takes a lot of strain off putting your feet flat on the ground. Additionally, the sensation with socks on is quite weird so I usually go rest my bare feet on the pillow or wear sandals on the top of it. I think it is quite reasonable for the price.",
