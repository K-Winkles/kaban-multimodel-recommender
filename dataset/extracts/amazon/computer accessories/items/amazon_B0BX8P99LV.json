                "reviewText": "Got this to use with an M2 macbook that I travel often with and, despite traveling, often end up needing all the extra ports including network + displays. No issues with this one. Pass-thru PD works great. HDMI has not yet driven a 4k display but does work well on a 1080p ultrawide, so I'm satisfied with that. If anything I wish it had MORE ports - USB-A specifically - but I'm using an extra USB hub on one of them without issue (I need to plug in: fingerprint reader, security key, headset, mouse/keyboard receiver, USB data sticks, etc on the reg). Overall, quite pleased! Have only had a chance to use the microSD reader, not the full SD reader, but that's a nice-to-have when reviewing security or dashboard camera footage (rare, but hey, extra features so I can't complain.Overall quite happy with this. I wish a bigger version existed with more ports, but this is a solid option for a traveling technician's kit.",
