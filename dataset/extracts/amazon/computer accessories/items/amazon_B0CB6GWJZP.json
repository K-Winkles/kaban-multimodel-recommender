                "reviewText": "You're always taking a risk when you buy a budget headset but this one is worth it.Purchased on sale for $32 and it has exceeding my expectations.Sound quality is very good, but worth noting it is slightly on the bass heavier side. Might be a positive for some a negative for others but it isn't overpowering.Microphone quality is acceptable. You will sound as if you are talking through a headset, but no clarity or volume issues. If you require a microphone for hosting calls, streaming, etc. this one might not fit your needs. I would have liked to see them include a foam cover for mic, as it is a dirt cheap accessory that can drastically add value to any microphone. Noise canceling seems to be average at best.Completely plug and play. No drivers or downloads necessary. USB wireless, 3.5mm, Bluetooth. PC, Phone, Car. Using the 2.4ghz wireless I was still able to hear my audio several rooms away, approximately 45 feet. Microphone transmission had minor hiccups at that range.The fit is very snug, but not uncomfortable. Most background noise will be suppressed when wearing the headset due to the design. Ear and head padding is adequate.Only potential issues I see are the height adjustments or overall tension becoming too lose or stretched too quickly over time. There is no tension strap feature above, and it relies solely on the top padding and innate snugness to rest on your head.Can not give an accurate assessment of battery life at this time but the charge it shipped with lasted at least 12 hours before giving an audio low battery notification.Headset still works while charging and as I am writing this review.My only negatives so far outside of the the minor improvements and suggestions I listed above would be:-Battery level indication upon powering the headset. Just a voice indicating high/medium/low level.-Mute and Lighting settings being persistent and not resetting after powering off.Overall this headset has already outperformed others that are double or even triple the cost.",

This checked all my boxes. I'm not much of a mic user for gaming so I haven't used it in that aspect. Purely on sound though these are the ones, if you're on the edge about these I'm here to tell u to do it. Nice bass. Nice volume. Easy on the eyes, ours lights up a soft blue and looks dope at night. Comes with a Bluetooth USB which connects easy and headphone jack. A product has to blow me away for me to come on here and write a post. Gonna circle back to these going forward. Rock on yall.",

You will not be able to connect via Bluetooth. Not compatible with PS5, but the attached flash drive that you can insert into PS5 allows it to connect wirelessly. There is no lag in connection. The battery of headset lasts a long time before needing to charge. I'm overall satisfied.",

The moment I put them on, my party that I was in was like, you sound great. They are very loud, almost too loud, but there is a volume control. I was concerned about the sound cues in siege but they sounded pretty clear as I could tell what direction foot steps were coming from.They are a bit more solid that I expected and have some weight to them when you pick them up and feel comfortable on my head which is large, lol.The wireless feature does have some issues as I could hear some crackling and sounds breaking up as if I was lagging, but it comes and goes on the PS4. Overall very pleased with them.",

If I have the volume on then forget about talking to me, I can\u2019t hear anything at all! 1000/10 would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I got this to replace my old headset since the right ear broke because of faulty material. This headset I\u2019ve had for about a month and so far it\u2019s as good as new still! I am very gentle with taking it off my head and at first the headset was tight on my head so I had to stretch it at first for it to fit. Over the next week or so the headset adjusted to my head and now I feel no tightness. The ear cushions are really soft and comfy for me even after hours of wear. The detachable mic is really clear for me when I talk with friends, I don\u2019t hear complaints of background noise from them. The headset has a lady that will announce when it\u2019s on, off, pairing, connected, and if mic is muted or not. This announcement will temporarily cut off sound while she speaks. I like that the headset auto pairs to my computer when I turn it on and I don\u2019t have to repair it. Another bonus is that you can use the headset while you are charging it. I find that I use the headset mostly with the light off since it saves battery life and I can use it for multiple days before it needs to be recharged. Normally at around 10-20% it\u2019ll start telling you the battery is low but the alert is short and not too distracting.",

The noise cancellation is not the best but certainly not the worst as well (comparing to Apple noise cancelling AirPods). It\u2019s good enough for gaming.",

While the quality control does seem a little hit or miss, the company at least seems to be prioritizing the customer when it comes to any defective hardware you may receive.Sound quality is good, the top volume is kind of ridiculously loud so it's best to keep it around half volume for most content. Haven't had any trouble connecting via Bluetooth. Wired connection automatically turns off the wireless functions so you don't have to worry about it using up battery. They're a little bulky, so they get uncomfortable around the ears after a few hours. The USB adapter is completely broken, will not connect even with the headset in adapter mode, and the dongle heats up a lot while plugged in to the PC, to the point where the little metal button is scalding. Would prefer to be able to switch from the voice feedback for connecting etc. to chimes or something, just personal preference. Either way, it does most of what I was expecting it to do, but there are improvements to be made.",
