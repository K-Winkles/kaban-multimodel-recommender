                "reviewText": "I wanted a cheap small speaker for my workshop while I worked on stuff. Requirements were that it'd have no battery and could be powered off usb so I could just swap powerbanks when they die, and have both bluetooth and aux input so I could plug in portable audio players. This model seemed like it'd work well and it was only $50 so I gave it a shot. So far here's my breakdown on pros and cons of this speaker:Pros:- Was packaged very well, foam to prevent damage during shipping- Easy to use, didn't even have to read the manual to figure it out- Has many different RGB lighting modes from solid, color fading, RGB scrolling bar, VU meter that dances to music and off in case you want no flashing lights- Remembers settings when unplugged (volume, bluetooth or aux, rgb setting), this is a big one as many speakers don't for some reason and it's super annoying to have to constantly reset settings- Compact footprint but louder that I expected given the size- Weight feels good and has nice rubber feet, doesn't rattle or slide on surfaces- Volume knob on side is awesome, rotating controls volume and pressing in changes led light effects/color (holding for a few seconds toggles bluetooth/aux input modes)- No problem with bluetooth cutting out while I move around and pairs up quickly/without any issue- Can be powered off just about any usb port, charger or powerbank- Cables come with a nice velcro wire wrap to keep them tidyCons:- Don't expect this little guy to fill large rooms or pump out lots of bass, but to be fair it does sound better than I expected as the pictures make it look bigger than it was when it arrived. This will blow your phone/laptop/cheap computer speakers out of the water but won't compete against $100+ big brand bluetooth speakers.- USB+aux cords are permanently wired to the back. They are ~2.5 feet long but I wish they were either a bit longer or just used jacks on the back so I could plug in longer cords.- Looks like it's always powered on when plugged into usb, there's no soft-power off function (at least I haven't been able to figure it out, should probably read the manual)Overall I'm pretty happy with it, it fits my needs and didn't cost too much while also not being cheap quality either. I'd recommend it to others with similar needs.",

Although they are in the same price range, the sound quality of the speaker is considerably greater than the one I now own. With ease, this speaker switches between wired and wireless connections to accommodate different connectivity preferences.Also, the minimalist design caught my attention immediately, featuring just one knob that serves multiple purposes. It's both intuitive and functional, allowing you to adjust the volume, switch between modes, toggle LED settings, and control music playback with ease.It is a great product, easy to use, and sleek design for a reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "This soundbar features RGB lighting and Bluetooth and 3.5mm jack connections, making it a fantastic addition to my workstation/gaming setup. It significantly improved my audio experience and also adds a touch of style to my CPU. Its USB-powered design makes it very convenient and easy since the PC itself powers it through the port without the need for an additional electrical outlet.As for the sound, don't expect a full-blown cinematic surround sound system, but for gaming, music, and movies at your desk, it does its job more than adequately.",

Very convenient and easy to adjust volume. I used it to replace the monitor built-in speakers. It fits nicely right under my monitor and makes the sound much better and louder. The audio quality is also quite good given it's size.It is USB powered and supports AUX and Bluetooth connection. The RGB strip is very cool to look at. Overall, this is a great soundbar.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is easily one of the best speaker bars at this price point. I\u2019m very happy with it\u2013I\u2019ve used it for gaming, music and during Zoom meetings at work (which is less fatiguing than my tinny laptop speakers).In my video I show all the features of the speaker bar and they are all easily accessed by the single rotary control knob on the side. Bluetooth connectivity is simple and fast and the included 3.5mm audio cable is nice and long to reach your system without having to drag one or the other closer to where you want it.The speaker has great clarity for its size. It isn\u2019t tinny as other speaker bars I\u2019ve bought, and the bass response is good for its size. It also doesn\u2019t distort at high volume which is great and has a peak volume limit to protect the speakers. It gets plenty loud-enough to fill a room with sound.I\u2019m not a fan of flashy LEDs, but these are very unobtrusive and can be changed or turned off easily by the control knob. Show this as well in the video.In short, for the price point there is no reason to get this speaker bar\u2026 it\u2019s a real bargain and a nice upgrade from standard PC speakers!",
