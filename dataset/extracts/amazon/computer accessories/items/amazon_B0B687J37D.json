With the addition of new gear, I found myself drowning in a sea of cables, and things were getting a bit chaotic. But this kit came to the rescue and helped me regain control of my workspace.The 4 wire organizer sleeves are super handy for keeping multiple cables together, making my setup look much cleaner and more organized. The 11 cable holders and 35 cord clips are excellent for securing cables under my desk, preventing them from tangling or cluttering up the space.The 10+2 roll cable organizer straps are versatile and ensure that cables are kept neatly in place. Plus, the 100 fastening cable ties are a godsend when it comes to bundling and tidying up loose cables.The 192 PCS Cable Management Kit is a lifesaver for anyone dealing with cable chaos in their computer setup. It's efficient, practical, and has made a noticeable difference in my workspace. I can't recommend it enough.",

                "reviewText": "The 192 piece cable management system is a great solution for anyone looking to organize their cables and wires in a neat and discreet manner. One of the standout features of this system is its ability to stick well to various surfaces. Whether you're mounting it on a desk, wall, or even the underside of a table, the adhesive backing holds strong and keeps your cables securely in place.Another great feature of this cable management system is the sheer number of pieces that come included. With 192 pieces, you'll have more than enough to tackle even the most complex cable setups, such as those found in a flight simulator. The assortment of different sizes and shapes ensures that you'll have the perfect piece for every cable, regardless of thickness or length.Once you've installed the system, you'll be amazed at how much more organized and streamlined your setup looks. The cables are neatly bundled together and routed in a way that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional. No more tangled messes or tripping hazards!Overall, I would highly recommend the 192 piece cable management system to anyone looking to declutter their workspace or home entertainment setup. The strong adhesive, abundance of pieces, and sleek design make it a top-notch choice for cable management.",

                "reviewText": "I was really impressed by the assortment of options this kit came with. Unfortunately, the adhesive on the batch that I received was less than stellar. I used the Velcro cable straps to secure a monitor power cable and HDMI cable to the bottom of a desk, polyurethane finished butcher board. Unfortunately, within 4 days both straps had fallen off. The other holders on the side and back of the desk are holding ok for now. The ones on top are fine, but people generally buy kits like this to secure cables out of view. So while it\u2019s a good assortment of options, temper your expectations because the adhesive won\u2019t last where you most need it to.It may be that the adhesive on my set is stale or old, or that it simply doesn\u2019t work on my particular surface.",
