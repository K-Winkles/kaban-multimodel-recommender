This particular set is for laptop/PC repair work and it more than does the job. The included magnetizer/demagnetizer and multiple pry tools are also fairly well made and have lasted through several openings of laptop casings. I can see this set being useful for Nintendo Switch and Joycon repair specifically, but also would be useful for mobile phone screen replacement, or any other small electronic repair. For the price; even if this set lasts a year of heavy use, it will have been worth it!",
