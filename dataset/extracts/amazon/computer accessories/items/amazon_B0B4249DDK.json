It took more time to take it out of the box :-) It looks great and they include stickers for the bottom so it doesn't slide on your desk surface. I have mine on a stand up desk, which is on my regular desk. It is stable and the little drawer is nice for pens and other things you want to store out of sight.",

The pieces of wood seem to be very sturdy but once the center piece was assembled it did not seem to be holding together as well as I wanted, so I added a small nail of my own on each side, top and bottom (which can't be seen.) The two side pieces do slide easily in or out to fit your space.",
