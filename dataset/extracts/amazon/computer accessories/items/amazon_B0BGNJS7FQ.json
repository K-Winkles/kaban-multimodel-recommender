                "reviewText": "I just purchased and received this light about 1 week ago. Attached it to my large puzzle table (approximately 4'x3') and it helps so much. It seems nice and sturdy and love the total arm length as the stiff upright part together with the flexible part allow me to have the light up out of my way and well over the board without getting in my way. Also love that it's very unobtrusive and neat and that it clamps easily onto my table (which is 3/4\" plywood) without having to be taking up a lot of table top space that so many lamp/light bases take up. (Plus, as I made my table by attaching it to a drafting table type of frame so that I can have slant the table when I wish, table top lamps/lights tend to slide/fall off the table when it is slanted... not good.) The flexible part of this light's arm is the best I've had on anything and so easy to adjust just how I want it at any given time. I love that the light bar is attached to the flex arm on a ball joint, thereby making it so easy to move it around to get the light focused just where I need it in order to avoid any glare off the puzzle pieces. Plus, being able to adjust the light color itself is also great for as the light changes in the room from bright sunny days, to overcast days and long nights. (Yes, I get hooked on my puzzles and spend many a time working on them well into the wee morning hours.) Note that it just comes with the usb cord but no AC Adapter, but as I, like many of us, have several USB plug adapters left over from old phones, tablets, Kindle's, etc., it really was not a problem at all for me. Just wanted to note that to make you aware of it. Again, highly recommend this light!Now to give it the test of time to see how well it lasts, but I'm not too concerned there as it does appear to be a good solid light and fits the purpose I was wanting it for perfectly.",
