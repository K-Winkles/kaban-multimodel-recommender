                "reviewText": "I misplaced my laptop charger and needed to pick another up quickly. However, it's a big headache to look for third-party chargers on Amazon. The vast majority are filled with warnings of users having their chargers overheat or simply stop working, and I didn't feel good about most of my options. I then checked Anker as it's been my go-to brand for mobile device chargers for years. As has always been my experience with the brand, this charger has a premium feel, works great, and is priced incredibly reasonably compared to official replacements.I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this charger to anyone looking for a USB-C laptop charger. Note - the device is listed as being for Mac Book Pros, but it works just fine for any USB-C computer. You'll have no problems at all using it with a PC.",
