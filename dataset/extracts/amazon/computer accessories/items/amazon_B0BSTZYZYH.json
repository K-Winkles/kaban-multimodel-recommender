It works great for that purpose, and supports my legs while I\u2019m sitting for long periods on zoom.But then I read the review on here of the customer who uses it on their couch and I absolutely agree. The size is perfect whether I rest both feet on it or use it in between my knees while on my side\u2026 which is why I\u2019m about to order a second one. \ud83e\udd23",
