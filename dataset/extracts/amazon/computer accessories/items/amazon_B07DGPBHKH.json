                "reviewText": "Dimensions were exactly as described. One review mentioned the legs being plastic, which is true. But it seems the outer surface of the leg tube is a metal sleeve around a plastic core, and the feet themselves seem to be a very hard plastic of some sort with a hard chrome-colored surface cover that threads into the plastic core. The visual appearance is good to me and the chrome-color plastic feet are not distracting.The threads from the leg into the glass inserts are quite snug and provide a solid connection. The threads on the feet are a little looser but this resulted in only a slight amount of play at nearly full extension.These came with adhesive silicone rubber pads for the feet which made it stick quite well to my desk surface and also stabilized it well when I stacked two shelves on top of each other. I did not notice any appreciable wobble with the two stacked shelves and a small amount of weight (less than 10 pounds), and with the feet fully retracted.For reference I measure 3 1/8 inch from the underside of the glass down to the desktop with the feet fully retracted.Also note that the adjustable feet are perfect for a surface that is not completely level. I was able to adjust one foot to compensate for a desk insert and get no rocking at all.I have set these shelves up flat for my application. However, if I had planned to extend the legs to different lengths to get an inclined surface, I don't think it would have worked out for me. The feet bottoms are flat, and if front and back legs are not extended to the same length on a level surface, then the feet no longer lie flat on the desktop.All in all, this is a very nice unit, especially for a reasonable price.",

This two pack worked out great. I ended up sharing the second stand with my son.Fairly easy to assemble, to be sure. Its not the greatest build quality, but for what I paid, I certainly feel like I got my money's worth. The glass and metal look was certainly appealing, at least to me. Certainly sturdy enough to accommodate my 24\" monitor. And it absolutely does what I bought it to do. Lifts my monitor up to a more user friendly level. Would not hesitate to recommend.",

I\u2019ve used a lot of the metal items of similar function, and they also all seem to have give to them, and can create imbalance and an sturdiness for the monitor, allowing it to wiggle with any disruption of the work surface. This is so well-made has very nice rubber pads that prevent any slippage even on top of a glass desk although the leg material, it\u2019s self, not the pieces that screw into the glass are made of a silver plastic. It doesn\u2019t seem to change the performance, durability or sturdiness of the product. It actually may enhance the lightness of the product , due to using it on a standing desk with a weight limit of 100 pounds weight was important to me. The glass is very thick and therefore doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue of it breaking and overall a well-made thoughtful designed product I would order again, or suggest to my friends, and actually have already.",

Be cognizant of cross-threading (always) but was not a problem on 8/8 legs attached to the base.2. Do all manipulations of the threaded rod by hand threading/tightening (one end inserts into base, the other into the leg)3. Turn until contact with the base, then half turn more. Do not tighten like the lugnuts on your car.4. Apply non-skid pads.5. Adjust height by turning the base at the foot of the leg. I didn't, but it is easy if you wish.I positioned 2 back-to-back to create a near-seamless platform for my wifi access point and mini-computer beneath the console that supports my TV. Very elegant. I chose BLACK so that power strip and cabling would be screened.Would definitely buy again.",
