It's silky but rather slippery, so you try to put some pressure down and your wrist might slide to one side or another.Speaking of sliding, the grippy material on the underside is pretty poor quality. So not only will your wrist my slipping, but the pad itself can move around with even just a little nudging.And the cheery on top is that obnoxious lip the pad has around the wrist rest, it does nothing and just takes up more room on the desk, forcing me to push my full-sized keyboard more to my left instead of leaving it centered. And the shape of it too, I get the point, helps for sweeping motions of the mouse, but again, it does nothing in an office setting besides get in the way.Might have gone even a star lower, but the thing does what it should, gives you a place to put your wrist to avoid getting carpel tunnel.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Amazon Basics Gel Computer Mouse Pad with Wrist Support Rest in Black, and I'm very impressed with the quality and comfort of this product. One of the most important features of this mouse pad is its gel wrist support, which provides excellent cushioning and support for my wrist as I work on my computer.As someone who spends a lot of time on the computer, I often experience discomfort and pain in my wrist and hand. However, since I started using this mouse pad with wrist support, I've noticed a significant improvement in my comfort level and overall health. The gel cushion helps to distribute the pressure from my wrist evenly, reducing strain and fatigue.The ergonomic design of this mouse pad is also beneficial for my posture and overall health. The raised wrist rest encourages a more natural position for my arm and hand, reducing the risk of repetitive strain injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome. Additionally, the smooth surface and non-slip backing of the pad make it easy to use my mouse with minimal effort, further reducing strain on my hand and wrist.Overall, I highly recommend the Amazon Basics Gel Computer Mouse Pad with Wrist Support Rest to anyone looking for a comfortable, supportive, and health-promoting option for their computer work. It's a great value for the price, and I'm very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I had a hard time finding gel pads like those I remember my Dad having for example, that are made of actual gel that does not lose it's sponginess. He had one for his keyboard that was clear, for example, and you could see that it would not lose its shape over time. I needed something like this for my mouse pad. My mouse pad before buying this one had claimed to be gel but was just something like memory foam. I was wary at first with this product but now I'm very happy with this mouse pad because I could feel the difference when touching the padded part of the mouse pad that it is actual gel. It's very easy to tell that it is not memory foam. It has been great using it since it arrived and the bottom of my wrist does not hurt anymore like with the last mouse pad. This mouse pad will probably last you a really long while. (In the future I may revisit this review but for now I have confidence that it is exactly what I was looking for.)",
