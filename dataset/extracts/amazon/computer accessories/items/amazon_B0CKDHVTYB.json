The Kinesis split keyboard is stellar, I have a sit stand desktopper and taught myself to use the left hand tracker ball mouse . Total set up was great, but, still having issues with sore wrists. I saw this keyboard stand and was intrigued. I had to order 2 due to my split keyboard and needed to glue them down due to the narrowness of my sit-stand desktop. They work great, my wrist and thumb no longer hurt. I am so glad I purchased these.",
