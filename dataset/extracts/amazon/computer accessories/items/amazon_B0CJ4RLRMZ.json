                "reviewText": "These USB adapters feel solidly built, and (unlike some others I have) have a satisfying \"click\" when cords are inserted, and when they are inserted into the computer. They fit snugly, but also are not too tight. They perform very well with my MacBook Pro: My fast SanDisk Extreme SSD transfers data basically just as fast when routed through two of them (chained together, in my third photo) as it does when plugged directly into the computer (without either adapter). Even when running through both adapters (SSD to USB-C to USB-A to USB C to the computer) it transferred a 4 gigabyte video file in about 6 seconds. Also, unlike some USB accessories, these don't get hot to the touch even when piping a lot of data. These are good adapters that will allow you to keep your USB-A peripherals dependably connected to your USB-C inputs, and vice versa.The only minus for me is that the USB-C to USB-A adapters are quite long (nearly 1.5 inches - twice as long as others I have). I prefer the compactness of some other brands, if only to minimize the leverage cords exert pulling down on the USB socket. It's not a defect or deal-breaker, but just a form preference.",
