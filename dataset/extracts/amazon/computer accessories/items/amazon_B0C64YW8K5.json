Usb ports charge my devices fine, but I have a separate fast charger for my phone.The base is made of cheap particleboard covered in thin plastic. Think old build-it-yourself modular furniture particleboard. It chips and cracks easily. Mine was chipped out of the box, and after 2 months is well on its way to disintegration. Keep in mind this is essentially a stationary piece of furniture. If you can deal with that, this is pretty good. I've 3d printed a replacement already; when it gets too bad, I can swap the guts over and roll on.",

My main issue is this item was used as decoration for a couple of weeks until I could modify a fix. The prices meant to adjust the height of the headphones was faulty and the weight of my headphones made the top part of the structure collapse.",
