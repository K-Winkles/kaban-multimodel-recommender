The appearance is very sleek \u2014 it's a perfect blend of modern design and functionality. I also like that the keys on the keyboard are fairly quiet. The mouse is equally nice, as it fits comfortably in hand, and the clicking noise is minimal, which is great for maintaining a peaceful environment during late-night work sessions. Totally recommend!",

                "reviewText": "0614-2022 Update: There is an idiosyncrasy with the keyboard in which, after a period of non-use, the keyboard does not respond to the first key depression. This is problematic in that the typist has to first discover the mishap and then go back and place the missing typed character. Not good! Almost a strikeout blow for the keyboard but not quite.Original Review:With the exceptions listed below, the JOYACCESS 2.4GB wireless keyboard compares favorably with better known brands, I think.First impressions are that its positives include excellent basic keyboard functionality, a keyboard footprint that is small compared to others I have used, which means more room for palm/wrist support if desired. I also like the improved visibility of the keys & their labels. LEDs intermittently let me know the status of Num and Caps locks. A third LED is labeled \u2018Power Indicator\u2019 but indicates nothing since it never comes on. Anyway, I am not sure of since included documentation fails to mention \u2018Power Indicator\u2019.After first impressions, there is the all-important keyboard functionality that counts a lot with me. Keys design is of high quality, I think. This keyboard gives a good tactile feel that suggests good design and engineering and construction. Typing is quiet, and each key strike instantly produces an accurate result on the screen.I see are three negatives so far:1) The \u2018manual\u2019 is lacking. The Amazon description of the product offers more information about the product than does the so-called included manual, e.g., The Amazon product description shows the \u2018Power Indicator\u2019 in an image callout but otherwise does not mention it.2) The provided user manual never mentions \u2018Power Indicator\u2019, let alone explain its purpose or functionality. The LED Power Indicator on my JOYACCESS combo NEVER comes on\u2014even for a short blink or flash, even during or after bootup, even during shutdown. So, the lack of illumination may be a defect. If it is a defect, it is one that I can tolerate because all in all I am pleased with this peripheral set and don\u2019t see the value of a power indicator on a battery-operated device. I am using the JOYACCESS keyboard and mouse peripherals on a Windows 10 desktop 64-bit PC.3) Customer service is China-based and unfortunately nonsensical. If you have the unpleasant experience of visiting this poorly designed website, you will soon exit in frustration. Popups that get in the way and can\u2019t be moved or closed, prompts for your name when you have already typed in your name, poorly chosen English words that do not apply, etc.My sense is that the JOYACCESS combo discussed here is worth the price because it is essentially a quality product that works well. I especially like the keys and the visibility of this keyboard.",

If you're using a MacBook or device with only USB-C ports, don't forget to grab an adapter.Biggest problem for me is that the mouse tracking is awful. Sometimes it will be fine, and then will intermittently give up and require tremendous pressure or shaking just to start tracking again (even with a mousepad) Even when working well, there is still a perceivable lag to the cursor.Keyboard is good overall - if I could pay $20 just for the keyboard and skip the mouse, I would",

The mouse is perfectly comfortable for me.Some reviews mention weird glitches and wrong letters appearing. Replace the batteries. The keyboard does surprisingly weird stuff on low batteries, but it goes away with fresh ones.The durability isn't great. I work in a car with a laptop stand, much like a police car. I carry the keyboard and mouse in a small duffel bag called a 'patrol bag.' If you're rough with it, the battery doors fall off, and it's easy to lose keys. I lost two keys up in the corner, but they still work when you press them, and anyway, they were weird function keys I didn't use. You can't push the keys back on after they break off, it doesn't work that way. Don't throw it around or slide the key side against things.",

This combo offers a sleek and stylish design, along with a range of convenient features that enhance my productivity and comfort.The slim and portable design of both the keyboard and mouse is a major highlight. The keyboard is full-sized, providing a comfortable typing experience, yet it is lightweight and easy to carry around. The mouse also fits perfectly in my hand and is responsive and accurate.The wireless connectivity of this combo is excellent. The 2.4G technology ensures a stable and reliable connection, without any lag or interruptions. I appreciate the convenience of not having to deal with tangled wires on my desk. The range is also impressive, allowing me to use the keyboard and mouse from a distance without any signal loss.The ergonomic design of both the keyboard and mouse is a major plus. The keyboard features a slight tilt and low-profile keys, which promotes a more natural typing position and reduces strain on my wrists. The mouse is also designed to fit comfortably in my hand, reducing any discomfort during extended use.Another feature of this combo is the extreme power-saving capabilities. Both the keyboard and mouse automatically go into sleep mode when not in use, which helps conserve battery life. The batteries themselves have a long lifespan, further extending the usage time.The 2400 DPI optical tracking on the mouse is highly responsive and accurate, allowing for smooth and precise cursor movements. This is particularly useful for tasks that require precision, such as graphic design or gaming.Overall, I highly recommend the Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo from J JOYACCESS.
