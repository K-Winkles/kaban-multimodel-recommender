                "reviewText": "I love this side desk! This is seriously one of the best items I have purchased for my home office. I have a small glass top adjustable desk with dual monitors connected to it. I have a work and personal laptops connected to the monitors. This side desk allows me to move my laptop, keyboard and mouse off of the desk into this organized shelf on the back. The shelf is well made great quality and very sturdy. I have it mounted on the back of the desk between the glass and the desk top frame. The desk is a few inches from the wall which prevented me for getting good pictures of it once I mounted it to the desk. The first 2 pictures are the shelf front and back. The next 2 pictures is everything it will be holding on the back of my desk. The last 2 pictures are of the shelf mounted on the desk, again, front and back. The laptop itself shows less then 2 inches above the height of the desk. I have a second side desk for my work laptop. This has given me so much space back leaving me with a clean and uncluttered desk top. Definitely worth the money and highly recommended.Helpful notes: You will want to measure your available space between the top of your desk and the frame you will mount it on. I needed 1-3/4 inches to mount the side shelf on the metal frame under the glass. I was unable to mount the shelf on top of the glass as it required slightly over 2 inches and I could not get that much clearance with the mounting screws all the way open. No problem for me as mounting under the glass makes the shelf almost invisible. Again, great product. Love the results.",
