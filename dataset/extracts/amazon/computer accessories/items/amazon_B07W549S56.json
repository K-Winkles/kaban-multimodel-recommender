                "reviewText": "Absolutely recommend this headset stand. Stand was very easy to assemble and set up. The stand feels very solid, and definitely feels very premium for the price. I haven't tested out the wireless charging, and probably won't ever use it. I already own several wireless chargers, and my main reason of getting this stand was just for the lighting. The rgb lighting looks fantastic btw. It's the perfect amount of brightness in my opinion. You can have all the colors, or select a color specific(up to 5 I think). I have 2 headsets that are identical, but work on 2 different consoles. So this saves me the headache of trying to figure out which headset is for what. Stand comes with a USB cord, and can be plugged into a brick or surge protector with USB ports. The price and functionality of this stand was perfect for my needs. My camera kept wanting to make the lights look insanely bright, so I adjusted the settings on my camera to as close to the actual brightness as I could get it. I highly recommend it.",

All headphones stands that support two headphones should also have two USB ports for the headphones to charge on. It also should not spark when you plug it in.",
