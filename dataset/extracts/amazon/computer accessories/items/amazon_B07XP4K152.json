                "reviewText": "Buckle up guys, this review is gonna be long,Amazing mouse. I started using it on January 4th, 2018, and here it is, over a year later, still working flawlessly. Not sure what other reviews mean with the software being a nightmare. Literally all I did was search \"utechsmart software\" and it's the first result, it's really straightforward. Now, *claps hands together* m o u s e r e v i e w !Build quality: 10/10It's grippy and textured, which, when I first got it, seemed odd and kind of weird. That is, until I got used to it, which was very quickly. It has a teflon coating or something that makes your hands not stick to it when your hands get sweaty. It also has adjustable weight, which is a godsend. It feels really solid and makes other, expensive, non textured mice feel like cheap trash. *cough cough* \"I'm looking at you, Razer Naga!\" I've never had a button stick or be unresponsive, and, as hard as I am with them, and as much as I use them, is truly impressive.Ergonomics: 9/10The ergonomics are awesome, when I first got it, I found myself trying to right click by pushing down with my ring finger on the side groove. Speaking of side grooves, I kinda wish they had a groove for your pinky as well as your ring finger, but don't get me wrong, you don't notice it unless you're thinking about it, and the grippy texture almost completely makes up for it by keeping your pinky held up on the side. If you use the claw grip on your mouse though, it just negates it and it's fine, and while this mouse isn't really made for that grip. There's also a thumb rest below the buttons, but once again, it would be nice if it fit my thumb a bit better, it's kinda blocky and not really ergonomic, but not uncomfortable at all, and most of the time, my thumb is on the buttons rather than the rest anyway. Some of you may be worried about how your hands will fit, and fear not! I have huge hands, and this mouse fits me like a glove. Those of you with smaller hands, also fear not! My sister who has small hands has used it and has said it's the best feeling mouse she's used yet! It's basically a one-size-fits-all.Features and usability/functions: 10/10Once you use a mouse with 12 buttons, you can't go back. Believe me, I've tried, and I'm perfectly content with that. I thought there's no way I can keep track of all this, but I did and it's way easier than I thought. This is advertised as an MMO mouse, and I don't even play MMO's, but but I can almost guarantee you will have no regrets. It's completely programmable and I use it for way more things than just gaming. In fact, I'll list all the mapped buttons now just so you can see what I mean.1: Alt+Tab2: Page Down3: Page Up4: Ctrl+Tab (selecting different tabs)5: Volume Down6: Volume Up7: Forward (mouse 5)8: Delete9: Enter10: Backward (mouse 4)11: Ctrl+C (Copy)12: Ctrl+V (Paste)See how useful that is? What sense does it make to have your left hand on a massive keyboard of 100 buttons, and your left only to 2-4 buttons? That's right, it doesn't.Software/Lighing: 8/10The software offers a lot of customizable options, such as DPI, button mapping, and lighting. It's relatively easy to use, and is decently simple. I really wish it had the option of customizing each part of the mouse a different color though, since it has a lot of places for it, or gave the option to breath through different colors, but this is more of a personal thing though. The software offers 5 different profiles, with each profile offering 5 different DPI switches and complete customization of button mapping and lighting etc. The default button to switch is on the underside of the mouse, but is also able to be mapped to any button of your choice.Comparison/price: 10/10This is an all around astounding mouse to have, especially for the price. It easily shatters expensive competitors, like the Razer Naga, even the Trinity version, which I have owned and tried, and falls short in every area, except for the lighting, which is pretty cool. Some people may say the Logitech G600 and G602 mouse is better, and I haven't tried them yet, but for now, I know for a fact that this mouse is the best bang for your buck mouse of this kind you can get. It could easily be sold for 70$+",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to Logitech G600 - updated 2022 pro wireless",
                "reviewText": "I had to stop using the wired one after a couple years of use, not due to hardware failure but the drivers and software not being updated. I've retried the g600 since then and the EVGA. EVGA has a trash scroll wheel and I tried a replacement as well. First one also started turning it's self off after awhile.I decided to try the wireless version of this since I really liked the wired and the software is newer and seems to be updated. So far I'm happy. Easy to program buttons and macros. Being wireless will take some getting used to since I'm used to having to fight the wire and pull the wire around to move the mouse. It's great but muscle memory still wants to pull the cable. It came already charged and worked before even finding the software/drivers download link. The driver card failed but when I had the old one it worked so I consider that a fluke. I found the software/drivers through their site's FAQ page.It's a bit lighter than I'm used to but it's built well. Smooth clicking and the scroll wheel is smooth and no clicking or grinding or jumping around. I'll update again if anything changes but I expect it to last awhile. The g600 main button would always break after just a year, and EVGA scroll is trash, where as the old one of this held up physically.Old review:I've used a Logitech G600 for many years and when it was finally time to get a replacement I decided to try this on a whim since it was cheap and had the full 12 side buttons. Normally I read lots of reviews and research an item first but I didn't this time. Short answer is it's great and I'm glad I got it.First one negative difference is the ring finger rest. On the G600 that is a button that I could program. It's not been a too big of a deal. I reset those to the trigger button in their profiles but it took some time for my my muscle memory to catch up. My ring finger would still like to do something sometimes.The G600 had clicks left and right on the scroll wheel that could also be programed. I never used this so don't miss it but it's a difference to note.Software: I've seen complaints about the software. Over all it's pretty good. On the G600 I had to enter combo keys to do things like cntrl+W for sprint in a game or close window, and I had to set up a hot key combo for volume up and down with the g600. This allows me to just select the option to walk or close window, and even volume with no extra hot key combos needed to be added. The options are already in the software. I did enter a combo key for closing a tab and it worked fine, once I remembered to hit apply. So to me this seems a lot better as it can more easily do what I want.(this part is not relevant to the wireless pro)A little bug that seems to be a software issue. Sometimes the scroll wheel stops working but if I switch the profile to a different one and back it fixes it. This seems to happen after I've turned the port off but not every time. I turn the port for the mouse off when I leave the room due to pets. So this might not be an issue for most. (this is the issue that got worse later it was either drivers being too old or maybe the cable wearing out)Another minor negative is the G600 could cycle colors as far as I've found you can only select one color with this. (I just leave the lights off on he pro for longer time between charging. It lasts all day that way)Over all I'm very pleased with my purchase(have had it a few months at this time). The roughened texture feels great, the weights help a lot(I have hand tremors and the weight allows for better control). The cable is even better, less stiff. The wheel feels better and looks better. The whole thing just feels and looks good and preforms well with the occasional minor glitch with the wheel.If I were buying today I would select this over the G600, it's cheaper and better.",

                "reviewText": "Compr\u00e9 este rat\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de conprar la semana anterior un Zelotes C12. La verdad es que iba a repetir con otro Zelotes pero al meterlo en la cesta de la compra sali\u00f3 un anuncio de Amazon de este rat\u00f3n y era exactamente lo que buscaba, 19 botones para jugar a MMO y sustituir a mi Razer.Le\u00ed unas cuantas reviews todas ellas muy positivas y puestos a probar ratones y teniendo un precio similar al Zelotes, me decid\u00ed a probarlo.Mi valoraci\u00f3n es muy positiva. Tama\u00f1o perfecto para mi mano (tengo la mano de tama\u00f1o medio), tacto bueno (semi rugoso). Botones del pulgar buenos, todav\u00eda tengo la costumbre de mi antiguo rat\u00f3n pero funcionan correctamente. Programaci\u00f3n muy sencilla de los botones.En resumen:Pros: precio, funciones, tacto, ergonom\u00eda.Cons: los Drivers no funcionaban con WIN10. Pero envi\u00e9 mail al fabricante, me contest\u00f3 en seguida, envi\u00f3 nuevos drivers y funcion\u00f3 perfectamente.Muy recomendable si juegas a MMO, para shooters creo que ir\u00eda bien pero ya no juego a ese tipo de juegos. Para ofim\u00e1tica y navegaci\u00f3n por internet es un buen rat\u00f3n.El Zelotes es un buen rat\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n pero por el n\u00famero de botones en el pulgar y por el tama\u00f1o de mi mano (el Zelotes es m\u00e1s grande), hubiera compra dos ratones UtechSmart (ojo que con el Zelotes estoy muy contento tb y es muy recomendable, es algo subjetivo y por el uso que le voy a dar).Un saludo",
