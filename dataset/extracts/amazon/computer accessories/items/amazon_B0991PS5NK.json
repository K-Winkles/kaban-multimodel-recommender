I have a set of gaming headphones that weigh about 1 lb, so I definitely needed something sturdy and nice. Installation took less than 3 minutes, the tape provided is very effective.I have had this product for about a week now and already loved it. I was having a nuisance issue with the wires of my headphones getting stuck under my chair.. and then I realized, this headphone rack has wire organization built into it and I was able to also hide my wires! This thing is a must have for anyone regularly using a PC, its awesome!! I feel so efficient and organized at my PC now.",

                "reviewText": "The product looks great, worked great for 2 month, no issues. After 2 months unfortunately, the adhesive just stops working. How are you going to make something that is DESIGNED to hang underneath a desk and then cheep out on the one thing that will make it last. If the adhesive on this product stops working, there is no other use or placement for this product. I can't give it a higher rating if I can't use it.Just FYI, the hanging stand is still hanging under my desk because I took my headphone off the hanger, now it stays. I just have to use it as a USB hub now because my headphones are too heavy for it, after 2 months... Shop around and check all the details",
