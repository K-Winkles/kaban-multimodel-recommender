The variety of choices provided in this all-in-one kit is excellent, ensuring there's something for everyone.One of m,y favorite features is the velcro, which proves to be highly useful for securing and bundling cables. It allows for easy adjustments and provides a clean setup overall. Additionally, the cable sleeves included in the kit offer a sleek and neat appearance, contributing to an organized workspace.The kit as a whole seems durable and should last for a while, which is definitely a plus. One drawback I encountered is the inconsistent sticking ability of some of the pieces. While most components adhere well, a few struggle to maintain their grip, especially the circle pieces that hold chargers, and device connections.Although the cable sleeves are nice, they have limitations in terms of capacity. It would be beneficial if they could accommodate more cables, as this would allow for a more extensive cable management setup.While the kit offers a variety of options, there are a few pieces that may seem less useful or unnecessary depending on individual needs. It would be helpful if these pieces were better explained or omitted to provide a more streamlined experience.The N NOROCME Cord Management Organizer Kit provides a versatile solution for cable management. With a variety of options, durable construction, and the convenience of velcro and cable sleeves, it offers an effective way to keep cables organized. However, some pieces may have issues with sticking, and the cable sleeves could benefit from increased capacity. Despite these minor limitations, it remains a solid choice for decluttering your workspace and is well worth the price.",

There are just a couple of things that I personally would have liked to make it a 5*1. The adhesive didn't stick very well for me on a couple of the smaller fasteners. I didn't fully expect it to and came prepared with a fee screws but just be aware, especially if you are using them under your desk to keep cables suspended.2. The sleeves are fairly short runs. I think j it would have been better if the sleeve was one piece that you could cut to length instead of pre-cut",

They are also easy to install and remove, so you can reposition them as needed.Another feature that I found helpful is the cable sleeve. This sleeve is designed to help you hide your cables and cords from view. It is made of a flexible material that can be easily wrapped around your cables, and it comes in a variety of sizes to accommodate different cable thicknesses.Overall, I think the Cord Management Organizer Kit is an excellent product.
