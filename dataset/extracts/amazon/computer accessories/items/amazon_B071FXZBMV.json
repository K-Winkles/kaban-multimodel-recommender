                "reviewText": "I recently discovered these cable clips, and they have been an absolute game-changer for keeping my desk and workspace neat and organized. If you're tired of tangled cables and clutter, these clips are the perfect solution.What immediately impressed me was their simplicity and effectiveness. These cable clips are designed to hold your cables securely in place, preventing them from falling behind your desk or getting tangled. They are versatile and can be used on and around your desk, making cable management a breeze.The adhesive on the back of these clips is strong and reliable. I was initially concerned about them coming loose, but they have held up perfectly, even with multiple cables in each clip. The clips are also easy to install and remove without leaving any sticky residue behind.I love that these clips come in various sizes, allowing you to organize cables of different thicknesses. Whether it's USB cables, charging cords, or even headphone cables, these clips can accommodate them all.The result of using these cable clips is a clean and tidy workspace. No more crawling under the desk to retrieve fallen cables, and no more frustration from tangled cords. It's a small investment that has a significant impact on your productivity and the overall aesthetics of your workspace.In conclusion, these cable clips have been a lifesaver for me when it comes to cable organization. I can't recommend them enough, and I'm giving them a well-deserved five-star rating. If you're looking for a simple yet highly effective solution to keep your cables in order, these clips are perfect for the job.",

They were also pretty inexpensive for what you get.If you have the thicker USB cables, getting them into the 3 or 4 wire holder is a bit of a pain but they do seat easier in the 1 or 2 wire holders.It is nice that they decided to use 3M VHB on the holders, however\u2026the VHB isn\u2019t for low surface energy materials, so it wants to pull off of the holders themselves and it will not stick well to certain plastics. (This isn\u2019t a mood killer for me since I have some LSE double sided tape at work but this may be problematic for others).If you\u2019re attaching them to metal, tile, glass, Formica, etc., they will stick but the tape may let go of the actual holder.",

They hold wires in place while still allowing you to pull the cable through when you need, which is good for charging cords. The 3M backing has held well even against fireplace brick. When you're sticking it to something, just be sure to wipe the surface and push hard for a bit.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these to try to tame the monster that is the giant squid of USB cables that I have created both at work and at home. As most folks don't have the time to read a dissertation reviewing something as trivial as these things, here are my takeaways:-These guys are large - much larger than I was expecting. Not too much of an issue, unless space is limited.-The assortment is good. I could have used several more of the multi-cable organizers, but again, not an issue for me.-Peel and stick was easy. No real struggle getting the backing off.-Adhesiveness to be determined. They seemed to be good, but several seemed to struggle to stay fully stuck to a painted cinder block wall. They would lose partial contact, and I pressed them back down to see them slowly lift off again. This could be due to a number of things (bent plastic organizer, uneven wall, something odd in the paint, maybe the sticky came off on my finger when I peeled the backing off...) so we'll see if they stick for the long haul.Overall, the product works well. Will update if anything changes.",
