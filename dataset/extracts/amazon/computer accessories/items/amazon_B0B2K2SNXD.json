As a gamer, I had controllers laying around everywhere and headphones that until now have had no real home on my desk.This handy little tool is easy to install and adjust. There are two easy to swap attachments to choose from: a cup holder and a controller hanger. The cup holder is nice and a good size but be aware some of your extra large glasses/cups/mugs may not fit. The controller hanger can hold up to two controllers at a time and makes for great storage! The headset storage is simple and effective as well and I love that my headphones finally have a permanent home. I was pleasantly surprised by how sturdy this product feels and am optimistic it will last a long time.I got the pink version and when it\u2019s loaded up with my gaming equipment it clears off my desk AND makes my space look really cute. I highly recommend this product!",

One is if you don\u2019t put a napkin or paper towel into the holder it leaks fast food cup condensation onto the headphones. The other is you can\u2019t use cup holder and controller holder at same time. I bought it for cup holder mostly so this is not issue for me. It\u2019s sturdy and very convenient.

                "reviewText": "I know for me, I can never leave my desk with a cup on it because my cat will ALWAYS tip it over. I've been looking for some kind of item to help but then I saw this!It's a cup holder that attaches to your desk. It makes it impossible for my cats to tip it over now. It attaches on by clamping to your desk, so no screws necessary.It also comes with interchangeable items. So if you don't want a cup holder, that part easily slides out and the other attachment for your console remotes can be attached.I think one thing I really liked is the headset holder at the bottom. It turns so you can either have it show and you can use it or turn it away.Building it was super easy because everything was already attached. You just slide which attachment you want and boom all done. The quality is really sturdy and the color white looks very nicely with my setup.",

I don't plan on using the attachment for the controllers but it could also be used for multiple headphones if needed. I like that I can swivel the headset holder under the desk to keep it out of the way. With the cup/mug holder included it's definitely worth the price! If you're looking for something that easily attaches to your desk via clamp that doesn't damage your desk, then I would highly recommend!",
