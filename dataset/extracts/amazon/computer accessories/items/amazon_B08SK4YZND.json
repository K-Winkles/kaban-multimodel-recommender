                "reviewText": "These are sturdy little workhorses for my two monitors. Prefer this set up as I can readjust how close each monitor is or their direction. VERY sturdy. Great value for money. The only thing I don't like is that there are holes on the top which allows some dust to settle down into the tray underneath. These trays are a bonus to hide paperclips, USBs, and other things. And, the fact that you can adjust the height is awesome. Would definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Just raising my monitor 5\" has made such a big difference in my upper back and neck. I am much more comfortable now doing my work in front of my monitor. I bought 2 packs (4 risers total) so that I can raise the monitors at my computers at home as well. Cannot recommend this product enough. The build quality is excellent, it is very smooth and feels like quality materials were used in its construction. The only improvement I would like to see the manufacturer consider is making the plastic pull out tray a little more durable. Its fine as it is, but I could see it potentially cracking or breaking down the line with repeated use. Other than that, excellent product!",

I love these risers they hold up to 44 pounds, there solid steel I think it said, I love the adjustable legs the legs are solid, oh an it came with straps if you wanna strap them together.Love the price, I would so buy more of these for the price perfect I'm a permanent customer.Even though the drawers don't pull out that far I still feel this item deserves 5 stars. That's just me. Either way I love them.",

                "reviewText": "I work from home full time and also have my game consoles hooked up here, so my desk area has a lot going on. It can easily be cluttered. This product is a simple solution, with a nice minimal design, that is multi purposed.Let\u2019s start with some negatives (there aren\u2019t many):I wish the drawers were about 50% deeper, just to easily stick a sticky note pad in there. Also, I wish the bottoms of the legs had little rubber pads, because if you open or close the drawers too fast the entire stand can wobble and or move out of place slightly. I wish that there was some way to screw multiple on top of each other, just to create a sort of storage tower. It would be nice to have multiple size options, because I would put my printer on top of one of these, and store paper and ink under the riser. I wish they were a little modular like that to fit whatever need you may have.Now, some positives:they are easy to put together. The packaging was nice, and protected the product well. I love that they came in a 2 pack, that\u2019s a nice value. Nice and sleek minimal design, fits my desk aesthetic. Doesn\u2019t look too clunky. I like that the drawer has a dedicated pen and pencil slot at the front. Just keeps things separated in the drawer. The tops have air flow holes which is nice for me as I have my PlayStation sitting on one. It would be very nice to have the legs be slightly bigger, and be hollow, so that you could run wires through them. If you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t like seeing wires, you can do what I have done which is carefully zip tie a cable to the back leg with a black zip tie.A few notes:I actually have my monitors on vesa mounts so I don\u2019t need this to act as a riser. I bought these so that that could provide storage for little things that clutter my desk. I have 2 monitors, and have 2 of them stacked under each monitor (total of 4). I put my misc papers under one monitor as a \u201cto do\u201d pile and under the other monitor I put my notepad and spare sticky notes. Having the pull out drawers help keep my pens, letter openers, misc USB and charging cords nice and tucked away. I like the low profile minimal design as it fits my desk aesthetic. Any idiot can assemble these, they were super easy. overall, I wish the drawers were a little deeper. They are only about 3/4 inch deep. Having them maybe 1-1.5 inches deep would be really nice. Overall, I couldn\u2019t be happier!",
