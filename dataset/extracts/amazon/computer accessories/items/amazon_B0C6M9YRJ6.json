I have a Lenova Thinkpad with Dock as well as my personal Lenova touchscreen Ideapad. I was using a usb set up hooked to a displayport my son had given me to work with dual hdmi monitors but over the past couple of years it became finicky and took time to reconfigure displays.I bought this little Dock for my personal laptop but since the Thinkpad had a USB-C, decided to retire the Work Dock and use this for both computers. It seamlessly moves from each which are stacked on a stand, and coupled with the dual monitor stand I also bought myself at Christmas, has provided the easiest workstation I've had for the last 10 years!!! I use the USB port for the little keyboard/mouse doohicky and still have an extra USB for my flash drives. I'm getting too old to work (LOL) so my only complaint is that I didn't do this 10 years ago!!! I did have to buy a usb C male to female extender as the cord is very short but I did let it \"float on air\" for the days to get the extension. All in all...I love it!",
