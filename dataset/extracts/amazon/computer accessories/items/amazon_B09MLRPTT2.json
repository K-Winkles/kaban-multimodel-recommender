                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the VIENON 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub and I couldn't be happier with my purchase! This hub has proven to be an invaluable addition to my setup.First and foremost, the build quality is exceptional. The hub feels sturdy and well-made, giving me confidence that it will last for a long time. The compact size is also a major plus, making it easy to carry around or tuck away on my desk without taking up much space.The USB 3.0 speeds are impressive. I've noticed a significant improvement in data transfer rates compared to my previous hub. Whether I'm transferring large files or connecting multiple devices, everything works seamlessly and without any lag or delay.One of the standout features for me is the thoughtful design. The ports are well-spaced, allowing for easy and convenient plug-ins without crowding or interfering with adjacent connections. This has made a noticeable difference when using bulkier USB devices.I also appreciate the LED indicator lights, which provide a clear visual confirmation that the hub is active and working. It's a small touch, but it's these little details that demonstrate VIENON's attention to quality and user experience.Lastly, the affordability of this hub is a major selling point. Considering the level of performance and reliability it offers, it's an outstanding value for the price.In summary, the VIENON 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub has exceeded my expectations in every way. It's a reliable, well-designed, and high-performing device that has made a positive impact on my workflow. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a top-notch USB hub!",

So far I have my keyboard, mouse, speaker, ring light, LED mousepad, and webcam plugged in with no issues. I like that there\u2019s a light to indicate there\u2019s power running through. My only con so far is that I wish the cord was about an inch or two longer. It feels cheap and very light, but like I said it\u2019s getting the job done and running everything I plug into it. I\u2019ll update if there are any issues I run into.",

So I spent 30ish minutes and found this. It was a nice price with great reviews. So I bought it and it arrived a couple days later as I wasn\u2019t a prime member yet. I really enjoy having this. I bought the four port one. And it works absolutely great. If you are on a slight budget and need something simple this should be a go to.",

It's thin enough to not get in the way when the laptop lid is closed, and all of the ports are easily accessible.",
