About using ports at the same time All ports can be used simultaneously.However, due to the performance limitations of some laptops, it's recommended to avoid connecting peripherals that requires more than 900mA start-up current. Please only connect one hard drive / SSD at a time 3. About being hot When the usb c hub is fully loaded, its surface may reach 149\u00b0F, which is normal for an aluminum shell usbc hub to dissipate heat and keep running properly 4. About interference with WIFI signal According to Microsoft, USB 3.0 may be affected by 2.4GHz Wi-Fi. It is suggested that you set your Wi-Fi frequency to 5GHz to avoid this problem",

No matter what USB spot I plug it into, I have to constantly unplug my keyboard to reconnect it. I will be typing and it will just randomly stop. Now all of a sudden its doing the same thing for my webcam. I thought the device I've had since May was just defective (it's done it this whole time and I've just been lazy and dealt with it) but now that its starting to cause issues with my webcam its even more of a hassle. I bought a new one hoping it would work fine and there was just an issue with the original one I purchased but I had the same issue right off the bat.
