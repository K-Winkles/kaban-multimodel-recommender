The attached velcro strap fixes the cable and headset to prevent disconnection during movement. Note: When connecting to your computer, please insert this USB 3.0 cable into the USB A 3.1/ USB A 3.0 port.",

                "reviewText": "I can say for the price of this link cable and the length and durability the price is worth it straight out of the box easy connection no struggling with the headset connector and best of all it works perfectly I did buy other types of link cable before not a great experience with some especially with the connector either it's to tight or to loose and the cable is to stiff or brittle. I already had the quest link cable I didn't want to pay a whole lot for it again so I give this cable a try to my surprise it works well and connects right away my meta head set recognized it right away great experience with this cable been using it for 2 months almost every day the only down side is don't use it for charging your headset either use the charger that came with the headset or look for something else it charges really slow but overall the best for a quest link headset to pc cable I will buy another if this guy goes down but I doubt it will and I do recommend it as a good replacement for the quest link cable.",

I had been using AirLink with my Quest 2 and it is fine but for fast head movements or some really detailed scenes it would get laggy. This fixes all of that for those times when I don\u2019t need to be fully mobile. I like that it came with a Velcro strap that secures it to the headset. Overall great bargain.",

                "reviewText": "I have only used this for two times; on the second session, it did not work at first, but magically did after 10 minutes of waiting. Maybe it got confused if i was using air link or the cable rift. I only bought this because it's cheaper than the 80 dollar official one to play H3VR since air link doesn't work well.Anyone whos new to using a cable link can have the cord into your shirt or go behind your back so you can't whack it accidentally. It's a minor but necessary discomfortMy thing will probably break after a few months like I saw on other reviews but if you don't use vr much like me, maybe this is for you. that's why I'm rating 5 star and not three- it's cheap enough for my purposes.",

The only issue is the data transfer speeds measured by the oculus application on my pc. With the cable plugged into my quest 3 and the \u201cvr ready\u201d usb 3.0 port on my motherboard the oculus application only reads 336Mbps and gives a warning saying that it is a usb2.0 connection. Despite this, the cable performs perfectly fine and I\u2019m still able to run native resolution at 90hz. As for the charging that everyone complains about, that\u2019s not the cables fault. Power delivery is up to your motherboard and it\u2019s not within spec to supply as much power as this headset is going to draw. Be happy it\u2019s still using up battery, otherwise your motherboard would blow up.",
