Phone does not fit in the holder, but I knew it wouldn't with a case on the phone when I purchased it. But the holder works great for storing the USB Cable during transit. The 6 fans keep the entire laptop really cool with no heat felt. works great on the lap, at school (actually fits in a backpack) and on the office desk. Super quiet and the lights and different settings for the lights are cool. Also works with lights turned off. Purchased for a standard laptop and a laptop the folds into a tablet, works great for both. Will purchase more in the future for Samsung tablets.",

It comes with an adjustable stand and a USB to USB cable to plug into your laptop. Its UI is simple, a power button, plus and minus for the fans (6 levels), and a light button that goes through the LED options and you can hold it to power off. The RGB was shockingly well done for something at this price point and the fans are also very quiet.The fans are more powerful than I expected, I didn't do anything scientific for this so we are about to enter some bro science but here we go. My Laptop is a Razer with a 3080 in it, and would get so hot I couldn't use the keyboard while gaming. The fans cool it so much that even after gaming for hours it is only warm to the touch (and it was burn your leg hair off before). I attribute this to the well-placed fans fitting right where my computers intake fans are and that the fans spin up quite well. Not a crazy performance boost... but enough to justify the purchase!If you like how it looks, then I can certainly say it keeps my heater cooled off enough to be comfortable for hours. RGB was beyond expectation, fans work great and arent audible... I mean this is really a great cooling pad. The lifting mechanism is quite strong for me to type on my laptop while elevated. I think you will share the same sentiment as I do should you purchase this cooling pad as It was a great solution!",

I purchased this and it makes the laptop much easier to see and use and the fans are adjustable and keep my lap cool as well! The lights are fun to look at and inspire creativity as well! Much needed for my situation and my computer and it worked perfectly! Definitely worth the price!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars This Laptop Cooler is well designed in all the right places...UPDATE",
                "reviewText": "I got this particular laptop cooler A: Because I needed one fast, and B: I wanted one that didn't have the design flaws of my previous product, made by Kootec. On the Kootec, the USB cord was built to go underneath the adjustable bracket used to set the angle of the laptop fan table. Needless to say, over time, despite being careful, the USB cord was damaged to the point that it simply stopped working. The Keibn cooler I just received came with a braided, two-male USB cable, that plugs into the SIDE of the unit, away from any pinch-points. While that only leaves 1 USB port open it's still a good call because there's nothin' like having to toss a good piece of hardware because the power cord isn't worth the hassle/time to replace. While light, the construction is solid, with heavy-duty stops to keep even heavy laptops from sliding off when angled. I personally found the pulsating lights to be annoying (old age) and was glad to find that I could turn them off by holding down the light button for 4 sec. The unit has 6 fan settings and is very VERY quiet. I liked that. Note: Vacuum your cooler occasionally, it'll save the fans and keep 'em quiet. Haven't figured out how to detach the phone holder, I would probably not use it anyway. For the price, I think, with care, that this should last at least as long as this 20yr Alienware M1 laptop! Update: So, here's the \"Chicken or the Egg\" question: The fans push the air to the bottom of the laptop, and yes, it does seem to cool it well, although the laptop's internal fan runs occasionally. My question: Should the fans run forward (push), air to the bottom of the laptop, or is it more efficient to run backward (pull), thus pulling heat AWAY from the bottom of the laptop? Any engineers out there?",

                "reviewText": "I don't usually take the time to write this thorough of a review, but I think this pad honestly deserves it. I have an older Precision, but it is still capable of significant performance. However, it is bulky and gets pretty hot when I'm running a game, rendering a video, or recording music. So, I decided to get a cooling pad. I got this pad because it was cheap and would arrive the next day. For the price, I was expecting maybe 10 degrees cooler, but it more than doubled that temp drop. It also took much longer for it to heat up. It looks nice and is highly functional, but I got it for the purpose of cooling and in this aspect, it truly exceeded my every expectations. Details are below.Laptop: 16 inch Dell PrecisionCooling mechanics: intakes air from the bottom and keypad, exhaust is out of the backStress tests performed: stress-ng (Linux CLI program) and web-based GPU stress, simultaneously, ran for 5 minutes.Highlights (see pic for details)CPU: -25AMBIENT 1: -23AMBIENT 2: -31RAM: -16 & -21GPU: -24FYI: IF YOU WANT TO TURN THE LEDs OFF, just hold down the LED button for about 5 seconds. Do the same to turn them back on.",

I actually do like the product. It functions otherwise, so I decided to keep it.(Like) : It keeps my ryzen 7 Asus viviobook at 28 C Motherboard, 35 C GPU, and 36 C CPU. Fans are reasonably quiet even with all 6 going. The RGB looks really cool. If I had one without the broken hinge, then yes I would recommend this product. I just happened to get one slightly scratch-N-dent. I set it up even with the broken hinge, and it still works, and is sturdy, so I decided might as well keep it, rather than return through UPS for a refund, and go without a laptop cooler all together, while I would have to re-order and wait for a new one. I don't want my laptop to overheat. This laptop cooler does exacly that... COOL!!! It moves a-lot of air!",
