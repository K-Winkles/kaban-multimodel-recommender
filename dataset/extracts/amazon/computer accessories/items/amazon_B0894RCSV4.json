                "reviewText": "A very solid controller. I have a few minor gripes to bring up with it. First, the triggers. The left trigger gives less resistance than the right trigger which, in fairness could be a slight defect with mine in particular. The button presses seperately feel fine but using them together feels strange to my hands. Next, the battery life. It dies unfortunately quickly compared to some of the other controllers I own. I'm sure turning the glow off would extend the battery life by a good amount but I really like the look of the controller when it's all lit up. Lastly, the rear buttons. Setting them up exactly how you want them is simple and it lets you do a surprising amount of things with them (first controller I've owned that lets you set up macros), however, the button placement leaves room for improvement. The two that are basically on the grips are wonderfully placed if not a bit on the small side, but the two closer to the center of the controller are incovenient to use if both thumbs are using the sticks. For many people the appeal of the rear buttons is to be able to press the face buttons while also having full movement and camera control, so having to almost take my thumb off the stick to be able to press them kind of defeats the point. They can still be useful as a macro button, but if they were positioned on the grips below the other buttons they'd be perfect. Everything else is as you would expect for a decent quality controller. The plastic feels sort of middling quality-wise, not the best I've ever held but far from the worst. Face buttons have a nice press to them, d-pad isn't too squishy, turbo button is fun to have. Overall it's a very good controller at a price that makes sense, I would recommend it for anyone looking to add some variety to their controller collection or even if you just need another controller for group sessions.",

                "reviewText": "It just works, but based on the other reviews, I think it's biggest issue is the instructions...I use two of these with a HTPC running emulators on X-Input mode. Computer sees it as an xbox 360 controller. Works well with 2 other wireless controllers I use. So 4 wireless controllers all working at once, no issues.I wish there was an easy way to turn it off, or turn off the lights at least. They are pretty much always one when connected to a PC. The auto-off time is kinda long. Like 5 mins maybe? The other controllers I have turn off after just a minute or so. The manual might say something about this but it is all so convoluted....On to the issues these other people are having...This controller has multiple modes. The mode is indicated by the lights in the lower middle area. You hold down the home button to switch the mode. When I plugged in the dongle in and turned on the controller, my computer saw it has \"controller c02\" or something like that. This is not ideal, because I think it means that it is using D-Input. Either way, it didn't work in this mode for most things. Holding down the home button changed the mode and then my computer saw it as an xbox 360 controller. I assume that this is x-input mode. X-input is pretty much the standard mode on windows and most other devices. In this mode, it works perfectly with any game that can recognize x-input controllers, without even having to remap anything.So if you get this and it doesn't work with your device, try changing the mode by holding the home button. There are 4 modes, but it looks like just two x-input modes and 2 d-input modes.To finish things up, this has a TON of features, and the instruction manual is poorly worded and doesn't help in some cases. The M buttons on the back are cool, I guess, but I would've preferred if they were just seen as more buttons or something. The process for mapping them is in the manual, but hard to understand. I just want to turn them off, because sometimes I hit them on accident. With enough time, you could figure it out, but I just wanted to play games and now I am complacent.",
