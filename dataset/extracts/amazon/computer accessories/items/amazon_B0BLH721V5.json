                "reviewText": "I brought the desk mat because my chair (has wheels) was destroying the floor. After using it, it prevented further damages to the tiles, but it was collecting many particles such as dust. My chair is able to move smoothly across the surface with no resistance and the mat stayed in place 90% of the time. If your floor is squeaky, this product does not silence the sound. The product is easy to use and easy to clean. There is a small chance you will get static shocked if you are holding the mat and touching a metallic surface.",

I bought this because this is 50% of the cost of other products, including from Costco. THe product arrived on time, rolled up. Initially was difficult to un-roll and very hard. Once forcefully unrolled, I flipped it over and placed heavy objects, one at each corner to keep the shape. The thing unrolled itself and was useable in 2 hours.Overall, very happy w/ the purchase at 50% of the cost - it's a piece of floor matt on the floor so why pay so much more ?",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This product is overall very good quality. Looks elegant and is a well-built mat. There are no comprises done. Recommended for anyone for office needs. It's very useful to move the chair smoothly especially if you have carpet in the office room & also collect the items falling from the chair and easy to clean as well.My 2 cents below :Pros:- Thoughtful design and very functional product overall by protecting the floor & even making the chair operation smooth - Great build quality. From stitching to the material- Size is appropriate for the purpose- Easy to fold/unfold and use- Base is anti-slip and sits well on the floor- Multiple color options are available to choose from- Very reasonably priced for this qualityCons:- None that I see for this price & the quality",

                "reviewText": "Listing states the product is 48\" x 36\", this is not accurate. The actual dimensions are 47\" x 35\", while admittedly this is a small difference, the reason I chose this option is because it WOULD have been a perfect fit had the description been correct. However with an inch gap on all sides my application looked out of place.I verified this was not due to stretching and shrinking, both dimensions were EXACTLY 1\" off on all sides. This leads me to believe this is intentional.Additionally it's pretty difficult to move an office chair on this mat while seated, I would compare it to rolling an office chair on heavily padded carpet. Note I was using mine on hardwood floors and It still takes considerable effort, and often times I opt to stand up out of the chair and move it with my hands instead of remaining seated and dragging the chair forward with my legs (like I think most do in an office chair)Overall, for $15 its not a bad value if you just need the bare minimum protection for your floors.That being said probably wouldn't buy this mat again unless I was looking for the lowest budget possible.",
