                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great for standing desk with thick desktop",
                "reviewText": "I have a standing desk with a 2.5\u201d thick desktop to accommodate it having a drawer. Most cable management devices just don\u2019t fit. This however worked perfectly. Time will tell how good the adhesion is but it feels very secure. I did clean it with rubbing alcohol before adhering. For this setup I have a 12 outlet + 3 usb surge protector and a secondary 10 port usb hub secured with very heavy duty Velcro on the underside of the desk - more outlets than I will ever need. The desk itself also has usb outlets and a charging pad. These cable management strips are secured on the backside of the desk holding all of the excess cables. This keeps everything away from cats who think cables are toys, ensures everything moves smoothly when moving the desk up and down and keeps it neat and tidy. The cable channels are pretty low profile and don\u2019t cause the desk to bump out from the wall. Most of my cables are normal size and because everything is secured up do not put a lot of weight on them. I have power cables for two computers, a printer and various accessories - phone charger, external light and camera, monitor cables etc. it\u2019s important to note that these are not large enough to accommodate any computer charger bricks so have a plan for those. I have one for each computer and they are secured to the desktop above the channels out of the way so they do not put pressure on anything. Overall this works great with this style of desk to keep everything tidy and secure.",
