Just sitting or lying down for too long increases the risk of chronic health problems, as spine issues and this is my case.I have to say it is very well made and very supportive. It is not too soft and not too hard. This combo of back support and seat support has really make a difference for me. Wherever I am in my home or in my office I use this combo and I am so happy with the results.The only issue I experienced with the order was an error when handling my , but itFORTREM immediately sent me a replacement in no time.

It came in a vacuum sealed package and easily went back to its plushy shape after opening. glad i bought it.",

                "reviewText": "First the pros. I purchased this for use at work, where I'm averaging 8 to 9 hours of sitting in this chair. I wasn't outright experiencing any pain that prompted the purchase, I just wanted to be more comfortable. I liked the color options that this brand offered, as well as being able to purchase just the seat cushion, back cushion, or both. The cushion is very soft and comfortable, and I like the fabric mesh material. I haven't had to wash them yet, but I feel like it wouldn't be a problem. The buckle that the back came with works fine, and I haven't had issues with adjusting or unhooking them.Cons: I'm not sure the back cushion is doing any real good. With my chair, the back is kind of just there and flat. The back cushion is very large, and it's to the point where it forces me to sit a little further out, so I'm not fully sitting in the chair. I feel like because of this, it's causing some leg pain. Throughout the day sometimes I have to remove the back cushion.Ultimately, I don't regret this purchase. It adds some nice color to my office and the cushions themselves are nice. I definitely love the seat cushion, but the back might be a little unnecessary.",

After a few days of using it while driving I noticed a huge difference my back was not hurting alot and my butt felt better after those long drives. During the winters low temperatures I did find out that if I left it inside my car the gel would freeze and the seat would become hard, it was so funny.",

                "reviewText": "This product has proper support, excellent installation methods that hold it's position rather well and rather good comfort in my opinion. However, this product is definitely not meant for everyone.Simply put, the lumbar support is very apparent but it's also rather intense. I personally wish they had a model of this with maybe half the support. That said, it's also probably due to the design of my chair. I have a standard, flat back office chair so any alterations to it's seating design are very apparent. I imagine this would be great with more cushioned or curved style seat backing.Otherwise, it's comfortable and doesn't make my back feel like it's been resting against solid plastic or wood anymore. I'd say it's at least worth trying out for the quality and design that's gone into this alone.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Seat Cushion for Office Chair and have found it to be a game-changer for my work setup. The inclusion of both the seat and lumbar rest initially intrigued me, and it has notably alleviated my persistent back pain during long hours at the computer.The lumbar support is exceptional; it provides the right amount of firmness and contour to support my lower back, making extended periods of sitting far more comfortable. I've noticed a significant reduction in back pain and stiffness since using it, which has been a huge relief.However, while the lumbar support is fantastic, I found the seat cushion slightly lacking in comfort for extended use. Initially, it feels comfortable, but after prolonged sitting, I noticed it became less supportive, causing some discomfort.Overall, this product has been a worthwhile investment for improving my posture and reducing back pain. The lumbar support alone makes a substantial difference in my daily comfort. Nevertheless, while the seat cushion is decent for shorter periods, it might benefit from some improvement for extended sitting sessions.Would I recommend it? Absolutely, especially if you're seeking relief from back pain and better lumbar support. Just keep in mind that the seat cushion might not provide the same level of comfort over extended periods.",
