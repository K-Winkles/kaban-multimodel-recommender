                "reviewText": "I'd like to preface that there isn't a ton of options on Amazon when looking for a monitor riser that also provides storage. Here's my in-depth review on things I found interesting during assembly. Photos included!1. Instruction Sheet: Could be better at material distinction, particularly Parts C & D. Aside from that, it's straightforward. No misspelling like others have mentioned, it looks like every other build sheet.2. Screws: I noticed another reviewer mention annoyance between the screws offered which differ at the head. I understood what they meant literally speaking, but didn't fully grasp why this would be annoying until I did it myself. Included in the box is an allen wrench hex key. However, as shown in my photos, one of the screws required a screwdriver - which is not provided. I have one on hand but not sure why there was a difference...odd. First world problem, had to get up out of my seat and go to my tool box lol. Shame (jokes).3. Back Panel: It's actually loose. That back panel is actually too small for the stand. Idk why they constructed this piece as so, but I found it weird. You can't do anything about it, it still sits in the designated slot but you can shake it if you find yourself at the back of the monitor stand which is unlikely. Still, not sure why it isn't a flush fit.4. Side Panels: For my purpose I didn't want to use both side pockets so I simply didn't include the left panel. It is simply hooked on the side which I found odd because it is definitely not \"secured in\" by means of a fine fit or use of screws. However, putting things inside, and just by virtue of the side panel, it's not wobbly. I do enjoy the flexibility of including or removing as you see fit for your table.5. Storage: Plenty! For whatever reason I thought the drawer provided in this stand would sit on a pulley like a typical house drawer. It doesn't, the drawer sits on your table and just slides in and out. Has 3 sectioned off areas. As shown in my photos, a variety of items can fit wherever you please. I actually don't have enough items so I added to it. I purchased this stand in case my set up changes in the future and requires more storage which this definitely works. Going back, I enjoy the flexibility of including/removing the side panels as you see fit.6. Assembly: Took like 5 minutes lol. If you're not so saavy it may take you no more than 10 minutes.7. Height: On even other products I saw people complain about the height of the stand with respect to a monitor on top. For me, I wanted my laptop to match the height of my monitor for ergonomic purposes. If you have a monitor, which likely has a small built-in stand, you for sure will be looking at some minor tilt up. Be cautious if you only want to raise your monitor slightly, then perhaps a 1 tier stand may be a better fit for you. I also have a standing desk so there's a plethora of ergonomic options for me with my given set up but to each their own.8. Color/Material: There's only black, which I wanted white but I digress. If they had more than one color I'm sure this stand would be much more competitive than it's competition. I also didn't want a metal, grid like stand....but with the other options, this was my best shot for my preferences.9. Price: In my eyes, I think the product is overpriced. I would lean more if it was closer to $20-25 range like most of it's competition. For a near $34 product, I want every part to fit flush together, and everything lay secured. For reasons above, this product does not meet those standards.Overall: 4/5 = back panel not fitting, side panels \"secured\" by simply hooking it onto the stand rather than being built in, \"lack of tools provided/screw head inconsistency,\" and price. I enjoy it, there's not much variability on Amazon, and it's a straightforward product. There's not much room for creativity lol. If you need a stand and can afford this product, go for it versus the other alternatives.",

The Allen Wrench has 2 different ends to accommodate the 2 different types of screws. The directions COULD HAVE BEEN clearer (I like WORDS, not just picturesLOL!)...but I had no problem. It took me 5 minutes to assemble.It's sturdy.I would have preferred the unit to be deeper so that my eight and a half by 11 notebooks don't hang over, I would prefer that they'd fit neatly inside, this is not a deal breaker for me though.",
