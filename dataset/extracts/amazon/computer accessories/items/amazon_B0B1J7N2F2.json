No more bundles of cables sticking to everything around, like your shirt.These are SO much better than the bog standard velcro strips: they're stronger, wider, and gosh darn it cables like them.I already have velcro strips on all my cables but as I bring out a cable to use in a new build I replace the old strips with these and having colored velcro strips, strips that are SO much easier to use, makes life SO much easier.",
