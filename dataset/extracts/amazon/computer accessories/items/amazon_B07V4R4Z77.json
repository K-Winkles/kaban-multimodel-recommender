                "reviewText": "Got on sale as I needed a backpack to take my necessities to work. Very pleasantly surprised when it arrived. Very sturdily made. Lots of pockets to sort your gear. No waist belt or chest strap. However, it carries well without either. I have a messed up shoulder due to an accident and I loaded it up to test it. Carried like a dream. Easy to put on even loaded and with a bad right shoulder. Well designed. Worth full price for sure and even better with the discount. If I ever wear it out, you can be sure I will order it's replacement from the same manufacturer. I am carless and have carried adventure packs down trails on extended trips. So, I know backpacks. The lock for the laptop section won't defeat a serious thief. It will defeat the average Joe with sticky fingers. So, it's a nice feature. Since most thefts are by Joe or Jane coworker or fellow student. I think a nice addition would be a leash to lock it to a chair leg. Say if you are at a coffee shop and surfing and stick your laptop inside while you use the facilities. Then it would make it difficult for person mentioned above to walk off with the entire backpack. I will be adding one. It would be nice for it to be integrated into the design though",

                "reviewText": "This bag has INSANE space. I packed a ps5, portable monitor, 65% keyboard, wireless mouse, change of clothes, cables, chargers, 2 battery banks, keys, misc electronics, a Steam Deck and MULTIPLE controllers (Gamecube, 2 PS5, Switch) into this thing and it all fit pretty comfortably. Insane. I have back problems but even with all these things packed in with how it distributes the weight with the different sized pockets and the great shoulder straps, I had very little issues carrying this thing. Would be much better with a chest strap to help even more, but otherwise this thing is amazing.No issues with the security lock and I love having that option there for the bigger electronics pocket. I really love having the USB pass-through that lets me keep my battery bank in the inside pocket to charge my phone from the bag itself without having to dig through it. When I store it I hang it from the handle on the top and I was worried about that tearing, but it's been hanging for 3 months with some light cables and books in it and all that's happened is the handle warped a bit. No fraying on the fabric or signs of damage.I just love this bag so much and I hope it lasts me a long time. Fingers crossed!!",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this backpack in purple a month ago along with several others, but this is the one I kept. I love the color; it's true to the pictures. I'm using it for college, so I needed capacity, organization, and durability. So far, it has met these criteria. I don't know about the waterproofing yet and haven't gone through an airport with yet. The laptop section does open flat and it has some decent padding compared to others, but not on the bottom so don't drop it. It holds my 17 inch laptop easily along with the books, notebooks, & supplies I need for class. I gave 4 stars because there is a metal casing on the small front pocket where the carabiner attaches that has come loose but it did not open a hole into the pocket itself,. The pocket is still sealed, it's just cosmetic. There are several small loops on front, I'm guessing for attaching things to the outside. These are red for some even though the backpack is purple and black. Not sure why the company chose red for these, but they are shown that way in the pictures - just my preference they would match the backpack. All in all, function is great.",
