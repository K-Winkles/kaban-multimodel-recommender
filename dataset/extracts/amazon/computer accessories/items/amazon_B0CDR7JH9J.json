                "reviewText": "Review of STREBITO Precision Screwdriver Set 153 in 1 Small Magnetic Screwdriver Set with Case...I received my Strebito screwdriver set today. It was well packaged with no noticeable damage. Opening the box I was astounded by how many bits there was. I probably won't be using all the bits but it's good to know I have them. I inspected each component and tried a few bits on a few screws that are used on hard disk drives. All the bits fit well and did not wiggle in the screw head.I really like the bit handle with the extension. The extension lengthens by pulling back on the knurled ring. When completely pulling the extension out of the handle, I inspected each length and it was well made without any defects (i.e. burrs and uneven groves). Prior to inserting back into the handle, pulling back the knurled ring is required. I tried to put it back in without doing that and the extension would not go in (which is a good sign that the bearing lock is working properly) Before placing it back in the box I lubed it with WD40. The only tool that didn't impress me was the tweezers. The tweezers are not made for grabbing anything except a screw or larger item. I held the tweezers up to a backlight and noticed a gap from the tip down 1/2 inch. When squeezed harder, the gap increased in size. A careful inspection and the culprit was the painted surface. There was a noticeable bump that had to be scraped off. Overall, this tool set is very well made and I will probably use it for many years. if I could read the sizes it would have been near perfect. I ordered the blue box and the lettering is VERY small and grey in color. I have 20/20 vision but I cannot read the sizes. Even angling the box to the light makes it worse. I guess, small bits deserve small lettering. A background of white with black lettering would have been a nice touch.Other than that, it's a great tool kit. Can't beat the price!",

I have to say that when I got my order I was pleasantly surprised.First thing I noticed was the weight of the set. Certainly not plastic junk if it is this heavy I thought.2nd, the case the set comes in- nice looking, carbon fiber top, nice tight latch on it. Looked good and felt well built.3rd, opening the set confirmed it is well built. Everything nice and tight inside with nothing falling out.Came with a magnetic pad that I wasn't expecting.Great kit for the money. I would recommend to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "When comparing this directly to other products here on Amazon, this really is a good set. It's also a good value for the price and I'm keeping this product - to be clear I will use this product and not return it. There is just one problem with the product which prevents me from giving it a full 5 stars. When you open the case the hing feels very weak and fragile. So basically, while the case is open and in use you better not drop it or bend it because it is very susceptible to damage. They should have invested a little more money and made the hinge longer and stronger. I would've happily paid more money to have a higher quality case.",
