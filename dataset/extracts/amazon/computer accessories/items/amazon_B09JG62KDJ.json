There is no button on the mic to change the RGB light color, it changes automatically.If you are looking for a mic with controllable RGB lights, AmpliGame A8(ASIN:B09YLM3FNC) is a decent choice. Can I turn off the RGB light when the mic is working? No, the gradient RGB light represents that the mic is working. If you want to turn off the RGB light, you have to mute the mic by the mute button on the top of the mic. Is A6V mic compatible with Xbox? This USB gaming microphone is NOT compatible with Xbox, but it works well with PS4/PS5. Does it work with the Android phones or iPhone? We don't recommend using A6V mic with the phones because the phones may not supply sufficient power to the RGB light and the sound quality will be affected.

I use this specifically for gaming and streaming and have had zero problems with sound quality and recording. Depending on the environment, you may need to adjust the mic a little bit on the bottom knob or in whatever recording program you use. I personally do not use the tripod stand that it came with and have my mic mounted on a boomarm. Easy to use, easy to install - very plug and play. The touch mute with the light is extremely convenient for the quick mute without having to go into Discord or the game to manually mute myself. I wish I could customize the RGB, but that's not even something to really complain about since it's so cute regardless.",

                "reviewText": "Having recently transitioned to a USB mic due to the demise of my computer's aux port, I stumbled upon the Fifine K669B. Its plug-and-play feature proved convenient, and despite its lightweight plastic construction, it surprisingly feels quite solid. While there are some streaming challenges on Twitch due to background noise sensitivity, it remains a commendable mic overall.Initially, I found the gain knob's bottom placement a bit inconvenient, especially with a short tripod on my desk. However, this was easily addressed by using a low-profile boom arm, significantly improving usability. The top-mounted mute button responds well with a light tap, and the vibrant indicator colors when the mic is active enhance its user-friendliness. The sound quality is satisfactory, and the adjustable gain knob effectively minimizes background noise.Despite the noted considerations, the Fifine K669B emerges as a budget-friendly mic with commendable quality, making it a solid choice for those mindful of its limitations. While pricier options may promise better long-term performance, this mic stands out as a cost-effective solution for users with specific needs and constraints.",

                "reviewText": "This little guy is an excellent microphone, and the price is wildly competitive especially when bought on sale. The sound is incredible and it legitimately competes with mics triple the price. I use this for both work and gaming on two different PCs, and I don't have to have it directly in front of my face (or on-camera) for it to pick me up. The build quality is a lot of plastic, yes, but it doesn't feel cheap or flimsey. I love the capacitive mute on the top and the RGB that indicates you're muted is an excellent touch. Even though the included tripod was actually quite nice, I did get a boom arm to free up some desk space. Compatibility was no issue; the only tweek necessary was tightening the resistance on the arm so it didn't fly into the air, as the microphone is so lightweight. Just a great plug and play microphone that I easily recommend to just about anyone.",

The mic is lightweight so it can easily be paired with a cheap mic arm for amazing sound quality at a low price point. I've been using it for months and it's hasn't caused any trouble. My only complaint is that you cannot control the colour of the light on the Microphone or turn the lights off while keeping the mic unmuted.",
