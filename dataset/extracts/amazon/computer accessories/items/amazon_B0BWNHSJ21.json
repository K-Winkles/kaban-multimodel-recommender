This had a thicker back support, but that had a thicker seated area. In both areas, this was so much better. The support that I get from this from my seat is firm, and helps me sit a little more straight, when combined with the back support. While I tend to prefer a firmer seat, this is a little more firm than I find comfortable by the end of the day. I sit in my chair for several hours at a time, and after about two hours, with touch sensitive pain in that area, I've got to move. Comparing this to the more soft seat though, I still prefer this for the support, and can sit on it longer.",

But the strap are way too long to hold the back in place. I sewed them to make them shorter and it helps a little, but the back moves down the chair a lot. I'm always adjusting it. Since I sit straighter, my back pain is down a little.",
