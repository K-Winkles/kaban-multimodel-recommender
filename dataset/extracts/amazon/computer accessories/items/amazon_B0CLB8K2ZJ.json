I really like this one and bonus points for having 2 outlets in the back and 2 USB on the front. I'm able to charge my headphones while they're on the stand now. I've also used the charging ports for a few other things and it works great. It looks very nice too.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was pleasantly surprised when this headset stand arrived. My limited experience with these has been real hit or miss and this is an absolute hit. Easily holds two large headsets with no wobble whatsoever even when the stand is only holding one headset. The RGB lighting is a nice touch, many others I've used are very bright and somewhat distracting once your playing a game but this one isn't overly bright and does a nice job blending in with your desk/TV stand. Very impressed and will be ordering a second one here soon.",
