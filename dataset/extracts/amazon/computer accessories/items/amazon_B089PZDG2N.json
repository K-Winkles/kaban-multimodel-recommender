I\u2019ve been using it for a couple months now and it performs better than I expected. I would give it a 9 out of 10 if that was an option. It\u2019s not quite as stable as I would want but it is more than stable enough. The only other small issue is the extensions don\u2019t flow easily up and down. I may try to put some graphite on the shafts to see if it can get a little more smooth.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very satisfied with this. I don't feel like my laptop is at risk. It is sturdy enough and the screws lock in well enough that I'm not nervous. Assembly and disassembly is a cinch. Adjustment is quick and easy and not stressful. The included bag is great, fits everything in it easily, is slim for storage and has a handle for transportation.In my photo it is set rather low, I was sitting on a chair using it. It can adjust about a foot shorter than I show here. And it can go a few feet higher, this is definitely a lower setting. I included a light switch and door handle for scale and perspective.In more detail:Assembly is dead easy. The part that takes the most attention is putting the platform on the support in the right direction. It's designed for the platform to sit at a slight slant, so you want to pay attention otherwise you might put the underside attachment on sideways. I did the first time, adjusted it, and it was fine from there. Adjustment was a 2 minute affair. It was no big deal.The included bag is just wonderful. It can be a trick to figure out how to disassemble it in a way that fits (the first time). Just remove the one large screw that holds the platform to the first strut... don't remove the 4 little screws that hold the platform the bracket. It's way more convenient to reassemble the single bolt instead and the platform fits in the bag with the bracket on just fine. I also found it's best to put the platform in last, otherwise the bars can get stuck in front of the bracket and take an extra bit of fuss to get things out because they get caught. No big deal, just pay attention to what you're doing.Adjusting the height is very very easy. Getting the screw tight enough is easy. You can orient the screws however you want for making this convenient. It took me some time to figure out the easiest way to expand and collapse the feet, so my tip is to use the triangle piece surrounding the strut, not by pulling on the legs. It was quite easy when I used that piece.One thing I will note is the included foam is not great for letting your laptop breath. I use little risers under the back of mine to lift it and it's great. (I actually always use the risers for my laptop, here's what I like: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NKWY8SX )",

I like how low the stand can get, just over 17 inches, which I need to set up my projector. My projector sits on the plate perfectly. It looks good and easy to adjust the height. It is also easy to adjust the level or angle of the plate...to tilt up or down left or right. Perfect to align my projector to the screen. Just what I needed. You need to turn the knobs tight enough to keep the height where you need it as well as the plate knob. You do need to be sure to tighten the plate knob so your device resting on the plate does not shift and fall off...and yes in the future the plastic knob may get stripped from over tightening, I would buy a metal knob to replace. It is a 5 star item for me and I am picky. Great value.",

                "reviewText": "I had currently bought a home projector for movie night and was now in the market to purchase a stand for it but didn't want to spend a lot of money as well. I think this is one of those items that you can say \"You get what you pay for\". This is what I think -Honestly, I ordered this stand on a second chance discount, and decided to go for it. After a couple days later when it was delivered, it was shipped in the original box which wasn't bad, but the box was in poor condition would have preferred inside another box so make sure to check the \"ship in Amazon packaging\" box. At first glance, everything was packaged nice, and nothing was missing, so far so good. I started to assemble the stand using the included instructions although the assembly was straightforward and nothing difficult to understand. After completion, the stand looked nice and sturdy, making sure the joints and knobs were nice and tight. I proceeded to test the stand by placing a small laptop on it to test the strength of the stand and it held up nicely. This next part is what completely shatters my hope for this stand - The stand can be raised up to almost 5 feet which is great but the higher you go the greater the base you need for stability. I have a 3-year-old pug and a 3-year-old terrier which run up and down the house causing mischief constantly and, in an instant, knock the stand over. The impact wasn't even that hard and it tilted forward so I can imagine on a slight windy day using the stand outside, this won't do. That same day I packaged everything back up and decided to return it.Pros: It extends tall enough for most applications and the phone holder is an added bonus. It's very easy to move around and somewhat sturdy to an extent. It's also very easy to put together in no time at all especially one without any tool skills.Cons: It gets less reliable and sturdy as you raise the stand. The sliding joints along the mast seem questionable but they seem tight enough to where they won't slip back down under a heavy load.Overall, I wasn't completely satisfied with this stand, but I think for most users, they can probably overlook some of these issues just as long they are careful using it. I would like a stand that I can use that doesn't break the bank and be just a bit sturdier. This stand gets the job done at a cost, but I will look elsewhere, and I suggest you pass on this as well.

                "reviewText": "Sometimes when on location it's hard to find a table to put the laptop on for tethered shooting. Even more so outdoors. This is a sturdy unit. It collapses well.My only real complaint/suggestion is that the bag would be able to house the entire top unit assembled.It really means an extra 2 min to assemble and tighten the screws... but it would be nice to be able to not have to take off the assembled top piece and still have it in the bag. Other than that no qualms about it.",
