                "reviewText": "I've had this power strip for about three weeks now and so far my impression is very good. It has 15 AC outlets plus 4 USB power outlets (two standard, one fast charging, and one USB C). It's securely fastened to the edge of my desk, and I have it set up so the least changed plugs are on one side, the transformers on the other, and commonly changed plugs on top. Your milage may vary of course. The sockets are pretty tight, but I might rig up some kind of strap to hold the transformers in place.The clamp hasn't shown any signs of stripping out as a few other reviewers have mentioned. If it does, I'll put a pair of nuts on either side of the thread to keep it tight. I'd advise you to tighten it up just enough to keep it from moving. Don't bear down on it too hard. Someone else mentioned the cord at the end pulling the unit around. If that happens, you might want to tie it down with a zip tie and stick on holder.The only minor complaint I have so far is that there was no instruction leaflet to explain why one USB plug was red. Maybe I'm just old but it didn't immediately occur to me that it was a fast charger. Other than that, this is a solid unit that's worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "I recently ordered the CCCEI Standing Desk Clamp Power Strip with 15 Outlets, and while it has some positive features, there are a few aspects that could be improved upon.One of the main issues I encountered with this power strip is the weight of the plug wire. Unfortunately, the unit itself seems to struggle with supporting the weight of the wire, causing the power strip to sag in the direction of the wire. This can be quite frustrating, as it compromises the overall stability and aesthetics of the setup.On a more positive note, the power strip offers a generous amount of outlets, which is certainly a plus. With 15 outlets available, it provides ample space for plugging in multiple devices and eliminates the need for additional power strips or extension cords. The widely spaced outlets also allow for the convenient use of larger plugs, accommodating various types of devices.The inclusion of fast charging USB-A and USB-C ports is another beneficial feature of this power strip. It enables quick and convenient charging for compatible devices, reducing the need for separate chargers and freeing up additional outlets for other devices.The 6-foot flat plug is a practical design choice, allowing for easy positioning of the power strip and minimizing the chances of obstructing nearby items. This is particularly useful for installations where space is limited or when the power strip needs to be mounted in a specific location.Lastly, the white color of the power strip gives it a clean and modern appearance, blending well with most desk setups or home office environments. The clamp design also allows for easy installation and adjustment, accommodating table tops up to 1.6 inches thick.In summary, the CCCEI Standing Desk Clamp Power Strip offers a good number of outlets and convenient USB charging ports, making it suitable for powering multiple devices simultaneously. However, the issue with the weight of the plug wire causing the power strip to sag is a notable drawback. While it still serves its purpose in terms of functionality, improvements in the structural design could greatly enhance the overall user experience.If you can find a way to address the issue with the sagging power strip caused by the weight of the plug wire, this power strip would undoubtedly be a more reliable and practical option.",
