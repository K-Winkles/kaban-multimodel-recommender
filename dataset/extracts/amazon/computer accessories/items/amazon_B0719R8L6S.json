                "reviewText": "Love the quality of material and ease of installation. I opted for the screws (since I always have bad luck with adhesive) and it took about 5 minutes with a power drill and a pencil. Charging is as fast as out-of-the-box chargers. The little notches in the arms to hold your dangling cords are a nice touch. And the included cable management clips do exactly what they need to do.If you're getting this, I strongly recommend an 18 inch charging cable. It's just the right length to reach a USB input on the bottom of a headset that is hanging from the arms, and to reach a device that you leave charging on top of your desk. It's short enough that you can just leave it plugged in and forget it.Two small knocks against it (which are clearly shown in the product description so I can't fault the product really). One, the cord that comes out of the back is angled down for some reason, when you're most likely going to be bending it back up to run the cable along the bottom of your desk. Not a big deal since you won't be bending it back and forth, but maybe something to improve in the next iteration. Two, the USB ports only do charging. There is a model that does data transfer, but that only does data transfer (and apparently some super slow charging). It would be great to have a model that does both, even if it required a wall plug and USB plug, but sadly you have to pick one or the other.",
