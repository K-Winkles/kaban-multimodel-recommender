It\u2019s extremely simple to put together, it\u2019s very adjustable, and it\u2019s great quality! The wheels on the bottom lock and unlock, which I thought was a great addition. If you have a PC on your floor (especially on carpet!!), pleaseeee get this before you start a fire! I\u2019d give this product a 15/10 if I could. It\u2019s most definitely worth it.",

                "reviewText": "I decided I needed a tower stand after some of the components in my computer started to break down and I had to crawl under my desk and move my PC several times over the course of a few days. I chose this one because it was inexpensive and had good reviews that turned out to be accurate.It was simple to assemble and it fit my tower (just over 8 inches wide and 16 inches deep) perfectly at the minimum size. The stand is made of plastic and it does look cheap, but it\u2019s also sturdy enough to hold my tower. It also has wheels that can be locked or unlocked, which I didn\u2019t realize at first. Once unlocked, I was able to roll the stand easily on our rug whenever I needed to clean or access the cables.It does exactly what I need it to do and I\u2019m very happy with my purchase. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "What we all want to know is \"Will this fit my oversized case?\" Yep, this is a highly adjustable and simple stand. It has solid plastic at the corners and a frame with plastic snap hinges that securly hold hollow metal bars that can hold a lot of weight. I have a fully loaded Lian Li O11 Dynamic XL with full drive cages, dual AIOs, and a whole lot of weight to it that this frame is not struggling with. It is esaily adjustable to a footprint several inches wider in Height and Length than I am using even with this chonker of a case on it. I've already put in an order for another to hold a Lancool 2 in another room.The only 'con' of this is that it is not going to roll easily. The casters included are small and simple and will hold the weight, but I am using them on medium pile carpet, so it is entirely expected that they will not be rolling easily. They lok like they could easily enough be replaced with wheels instead of casters if you want to invest more money in the frame, but for me it does the intended job of lifting the case off the floor and I don't intend to wheel it around often anyway due to tight cable management.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this when I built my new computer because I wanted to lift it up off the carpeted floor a little. Also, mu computer sits tucked in between my desk and the wall, so I wanted a way to maneuver it out of its space to get to the back. The rollers seemed perfect. In practice, though, it\u2019s not perfect. The cart doesn\u2019t roll that well on carpet and because the computer sits on top of it without being fastened, moving it requires bending down to the ground to grab the cart and pull it. Not ideal since, like I said, it\u2019s tucked into a small space. But it was easy to assemble and feels sturdy so points for that.",

                "reviewText": "With my new build I needed to have airflow get underneath my tower, due to the number of fans and case airflow design I chose to go with. This little rolling stand is >amazing< and I wish I had one of these earlier. The 'stand' where you place your tower feet (or corners/base) is plenty wide and sturdy, plus has a rubber-like material to keep it from shifting. The caster wheels themselves are a little cheaper and don't swivel/roll very well, but it does the job. If I could give a negative criticism of the product it would be for the wheels being too 'plasticy' and ask for higher quality ones - but the stand functions as advertised so I don't want to subtract any stars. Maybe in their 2.0 model they could update the rollers/wheels to be a bit nicer and roll more smoothly. My application is in a room with wood flooring, so I'm not sure these would be good for carpet.=====Complete Parts List=====MSI MAG Z790 Tomahawk WiFi LGA 1700 ATX Motherboard -https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16813144567?item=N82E16813144567Cable Matters 2-Pack 3 way 4 pin PWM Fan Splitter -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXLHNZ6?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsArctic MX-4 Thermal Paste -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0795DP124?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsCableMod C-Series Classic ModMesh Sleeved Cable Kit -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HMJ6GNJ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details(2x) Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM 5600MHz CL36 -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WH64X5M?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsASUS Dual GeForce RTX 4070 White OC 12GB DDR6X -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4BZZWJM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsNZXT H9 Flow Dual-Chamber Mid-Tower -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BG1GQKKY?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details(2x) Corsair LL120 RGB Triple Pack -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LF1B1Y8?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsIntel i7-13700K 16core -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCF57FL5?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsCorsair RM850x Full Modular ATX PSU -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08R5JPTMZ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsRocketek 9pin USB Header Splitter -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085KVH16T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsDeepCool AK400 CPU Cooler -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PCWK7SP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsSamsung 970 Evo Plus 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MFZY2F2?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details",

So I am updating my review as I was very pleased with their prompt response and the replacement seems nicer. 5 stars.This worked fine for a little while, but soon I noticed that it would not roll and I have hardwood floors. So I pulled it out. I needed to clean under my desk and rework some cabling. That's when I noticed both sides were bent/broken. My CPU is well under the weight recommendation so there is no excuse. :(",
