                "reviewText": "So I bought this to hang my headphones, charge the headphones and home a USB-C extension cable and it does perform those tasks but not very well.The concept of having AC outlets right there is a great and you can get a small charger plugged in like one for an iphone but the plug socket itself is weak and all the charges I use easily fall out which is annoying.Second the arms that extend are nice in that you can move them independent of each other but they are too short especially if your using a gaming headset with a boom mic. You will find your self knocking off the headphones with even the slightly brushing of your leg because the arm is simply too short.Build quality on these is great and the two USB-A port and single USB-C ports provide enough power. Your not going to get super fast charging like you would on a larger power brick but it does the job if your not in a hurry.This is good for someone who has small headphones and a few small cables to manage but anything beyond that and your pushing beyond what this product can support",
