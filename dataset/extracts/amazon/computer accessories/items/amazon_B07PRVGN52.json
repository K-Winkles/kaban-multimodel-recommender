The aluminum construction provides excellent sturdiness, handling my 15.6-inch notebook with ease. Stability is another strong point; the stand holds the laptop securely, without any wobble or slip, even when I'm typing vigorously. It's a sleek and functional piece that enhances both the aesthetics and ergonomics of my workspace.",

                "reviewText": "Soundance is one of three stands that I tried (two other by BoYata). I'm having a severe neck problem since a month ago, enough to hospitalize me, and a more ergonomic setting for my laptop was urgently recommended. So I tried Soundance's laptop stand (this one), and two height-adjustable stands from BoYata.Soundance stand's quality is superb, the best of the three. It is NOTICEABLY thicker than BoYata stands and I could feel the difference in heft. It is perfectly leveled and the thick arms hold up my laptop (15-inch Dell XPS) effortlessly. In comparison, one of BoYata stands' base arrived slightly warped and would not level no matter what I tried. The long rubber strip running down the full lengths of both arms was a great touch (BoYata stand has four tiny rubber rectangles in four corners). Some people may dislike the high lips (that curved ledges at the ends of the arms that hold the laptop in place), but personally I liked it because it made me feel more secure about leaving my laptop in its hands. (Folks, please remember your laptops often have tiny feet/supports of their own which actually add a little more thickness when you sit them down on stands!! Short lips on laptop stands are NOT a good thing.) The bottom part was actually perfect in size (and clearance) for me to comfortably stick a wireless keyboard AND a wrist pad under the stand. The risers were completely unobtrusive and gave me plenty of space. No, the angle isn't adjustable, but that isn't a huge problem for me, and if adjustable angle is a feature you're after, there are other stands that offer this feature.When I say the Soundance stand is beautifully simple, that is a compliment. I strongly believe rather than having a lot of gimmicky features, objects should perform well and consistently in their PRIMARY function. No moving parts, everything static and steady, providing good support - Soundance is perfect in all this.There is just one teensy problem. I am petite (5' 2\") and yet when placed on top of my desk, I found that the 6\" of extra height that Soundance stand provides is just a little too SHORT to put the top of the screen at my eye level. 1 & 1/2\" too short, to be exact. My neck hurts more if I have to look down, so after a few hours, I decided Soundance stand just wasn't tall enough for me.But I was loath to give up on Soundance stand, so I tried a few solutions, including sticking something between the laptop and the stand (greatly compromised stability, NO GOOD) and stacking 1\"-thick book under the stand (the keyboard sat too high and strained my wrists as I typed, again, no good). It's puzzling to me. My desk isn't low. My elbows hang 1\" lower than the top of the desk. So if someone as short as me was finding that this stand isn't tall enough, how are the taller folks getting along??So sadly, I have to give up on this Soundance stand. Gain another couple inches in height, Soundance, and my XPS and I will happily return to your beautifully thick arms.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these Soundance Aluminum laptop stands. It took me maybe six minutes to put together both of them without looking at the instructions which were easy to follow after I put the stands together. The pieces fit into place without force. You might have jiggle a piece slightly to get it to slide into place and then you feel the pieces go snug together and voila. The stands are ergonomic, no more hunching over my MacBook or twisting myself into a pretzel trying to get comfortable at the dinner table or coffee table. The stand is very sturdy as it holds my gaming laptop that\u2019s thick and heavy without any problems at all. But what the pictures truly don\u2019t show is just how much the stands look like a piece of art. They look so nice with my IPad Pro and my MacBook Air M1. The stands look like they were for Apple products. So, if you have an Apple product these stands will pair nicely with them. If you don\u2019t have an Apple product the stands will still pair nicely because they are just that nice and so easy to put together I have a stand in my kitchen for my iPad because I often look up new recipes for what I\u2019m making and it fits perfectly and looks like it should be there since my appliances are stainless steel. Oh, and if by chance you use and full size Bluetooth keyboard as I often do, it slides easily under your laptop or tablet with this stand. My keyboard also matches the stand because my keyboard has a lot of silver like the stand does. Ergonomic and sturdy is very important but it\u2019s actually nice when all the pieces of your computer components mix and match.",
