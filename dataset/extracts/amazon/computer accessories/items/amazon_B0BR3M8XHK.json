                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Works even for Nintendo Switch OLED",
                "reviewText": "Specifically the Switch OLED is very finnicky about which devices you can use to connect it to a TV. Most of them limit your video output to 480p, and don't even scale to fill the screen. That's not the case with this one. It displays full 1080p.I think it has something to do with the HDMI standard of the Switch OLED dock. I'm pretty sure it's HDMI 2.0 so I actually thought I was going to have to return this when I realized my previous hub also supported 4k 30 Hz like this one. But there obviously is some difference between them because that hub limited my Switch OLED to 480p while this one doesn't.I've done a decent amount of testing so far and every TV output feature works with this hub. Also, with a third party Switch charger, I've had zero charging issues.I had another third party dock where my Switch powered itself off and would not turn back on for a few minutes the first time I used it. And that was with the OEM Switch charger too.This hub though even though it's not made for Switch OLED, it's working perfectly.I haven't tested any of my samsung galaxy cell phones yet with their DeX feature, but I'm sure it works as even my old hub did.The build quality also seems good. Much better than my last hub at least. I have a few other cables from UGREEN and they've never let me down. All seem durable and work correctly. This is no exception.",

Plugging into the USB-C port I was able to HDMI out, power in, and wifi Logitech Keyboard in using a K400+. I already had a Ethernet to USB dongle I use on a chrome book and was able to plug that in. If I didn't have the Ethernet dongle, I might have purchased something different that included an Ethernet port.It worked great. Right now it was just for giggles. But, I wanted to see how useful DeX was. Possibly for vacations using this setup could take the place of a laptop.There may be some hotels and motels though that lock down the HDMI ports. But, this item was cheap enough to supply me a few hours of entertainment trying it out.It's a bit of \"Spaghetti\" with the wires, but it kind of would be with a laptop and using the ports on it.",

This baby came with more than I realized I was getting. I now have this hooked up to the Thunderbolt 4 port on my laptop, my TV hooked up to the HDMI port of this device so I can extend my display to the TV while I stream sports and programming while I'm working at the computer, and can charge all my devices at the same time. My camera is hooked into this and works great. I can connect the iPhone to the USB-C port and charge it there, and still have 3 other USB 2/3 ports for camera and external drives. Does everything I need and more. Highly recommend.",

I have tons of old USB-A thumb drives with stuff on them I really want to keep, and to transfer to various computers. (My older Mac had been the last one made with a USB-A port on it.) I was serious doubtful that any of my old USB-A thumb drives would work any longer on this dongle, or that it would actually attach to the latest port.Guess what, everyone? It worked! I was able to remove and add files easily to my ancient thumbdrive using this dongle. Why would you want to pay $75 when you can get this? It's a classy-looking dongle, too, and not too huge. The one I have is all black, like the Mac. I am happy.",
