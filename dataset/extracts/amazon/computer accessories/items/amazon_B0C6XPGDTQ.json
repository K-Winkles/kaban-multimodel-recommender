I doubt this would work in a car because it just swivels freely so it would swing around when you turn. It's light and it does attach your phone to things but I think the only thing you can really use it for is desktop monitors. On a laptop you can flip the magnet around so it doesn't scratch the back of the screen but it sticks out so much that it's pretty impractical.",

The did supply a second adhesive with the package, but then the second Time wasn\u2019t right either. It\u2019s hard to determine the clearance on both the top and side. I wish there was some kind of template to pinpoint the proper placement.That being said. The device won\u2019t balance straight unless your device is plumb up against the side of the laptop. The first time I placed the holder it had about a 1/2 inch of clearance and the phone would tilt on the magnet left or right. It wouldn\u2019t sit straight. I reapplied the adhesive to the light and then I got it plumb on the side but then there wasn\u2019t enough clearance at the top. Sadly I\u2019m out of adhesive so this will be a side mount.Also another thing I didn\u2019t consider\u2026the whole tilt apparatus is why I went with this one over the other options\u2026but it tilts the device AWAY from you. Not towards. Not sure why you\u2019d want to do that.Knocked stars off because the installation wasn\u2019t so elegant. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking I\u2019m just an idiot and didn\u2019t place it correctly, but I spent a good amount of time trying to get evettthing lined up and with the right clearance. God forbid I change the case on this phone and it\u2019s gonna be a whole different story.",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent magnetic phone holder and has a degree of versatility, however the base must be permanently affixed to whatever will be supporting the phone. In other words, if you intend to use this to attach your phone to your laptop - keep in mind the holder will be attached to your your laptop for the rest of it's functional life.The extension arm rotates about 180 degrees (90 degrees in either direction off center), and the stand includes an extra adhesive pad in the event you need to relocate it. The side that accommodates the phone can pivot (tilt) on it's own axis, but not towards you monitor, only away from it, so best case scenario the unit can only be even with the monitor, never tilted slightly inward (this could be a problem if the back of the monitor isn't completely parallel with the monitor surface). This feels like a design flaw to me.Lastly, it includes one magnetic ring to affix to the removable device (in the event you're using a non-Mag-enabled device).So - it will certainly do the job to give you the ability to magnetically affix your phone (or similar device) to another flat surface. It will give you a moderate degree of versatility, and it's reasonably sturdy and stylish in appearance. I HIGHLY recommend you plan the placement of the unit ahead of time, before you choose to buy this. I would not recommend this as a gift,",

If you aren't using a continuity camera, I've definitely heard that my Teams meetings look a lot better.Note that this does use the red 3m adhesive, which STICKS. So, make sure you have the thing where you want it. I do, and it holds great, and also is pretty adjustable. I'd probably need to get another one if I get a new monitor, but thankfully that doesn't happen much.My magsafe phone (14 Pro) sticks like crazy, and I see no reason to ever get something else. If you don't have a magsafe phone, it does come with a metal ring adapter that you can stick to an existing case.",
