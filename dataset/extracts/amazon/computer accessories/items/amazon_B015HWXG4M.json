The stretchy material this is made from allowed me to bundle up excess wiring and tuck it all in to the fabric tube. The zipper is of sufficient quality that when I over-stuffed the wrap it worked just fine.If you're going to be swapping cables every once in a while this is probably not the right solution; velcro ties would work better. But this really does a nice job hiding and containing excess wire.",

My biggest issue is that the sleeves always seem a bit short and three to four thicker cables will easily fill this sleeve to the brim making smaller cables harder to adjust. I love the ease of use and removal of balls of cables but will be looking for larger variants of this item for future purchases.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a standing desk, and as such I was bewildered when I saw the entangled disaster that was now clearly revealed behind my desk. I had seen some videos where individuals velcroed their power cables beneath the top of their desk, and then routed the cables through sleeves in such an organized fashion. These sleeves accomplish this quite well, reducing the clutter considerably.In the product picture, the sleeves appear almost foam-like, with a supposed plushy springiness to them. However, this is not at all the case. The material is a strong neoprene that does stretch quite a bit - enough where I could get nearly 8 cables into one (albeit, not without some intense finagling). Some reviewers expressed dissatisfaction with the fixed lengths; I was able to shorten some, but with the reasonable side effect of bulging.The weakness with this product is simply that it relies on technology from the 1920s. Zipper are so infuriating, always ceasing to properly be zipped (or unzipped!). Of the four sleeves that I received, one zipper in particular was damaged, and I spent at least 45 minutes trying to get the thing to operate. When at last it did, I actually routed my cables through the looped enclosure, rather than wrapping the sleeve around the cables (as expected) so I didn't have to unzip and rezip it again.For those of you eyeing this product - if you have ever expressed frustration with a zipper before, do yourself a favor and buy Velcro sleeves to avoid any possible headaches down the road.",
