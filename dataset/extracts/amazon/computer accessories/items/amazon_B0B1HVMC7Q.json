                "reviewText": "This was the perfect smaller size connecter that didn't take up two of the C ports on the left side of my MBP. That left one open for a single USB-C BT connector for my external keyboard, a back up external drive, and two ports on the right side, one for power and another for any other device, like my iPad..Much better than a 7 port connect taking up both ports on the left side...Works great, speeds for data transfer quick- read the ad about all the ports on the device.. you will be happy you bought this... :)",

Die Installation war sehr einfach und der Hub funktioniert einwandfrei mit meinem MacBook Pro und anderen USB C-Ger\u00e4ten.Was den Hiearcool USB C Hub besonders attraktiv macht, ist sein Preis. Im Vergleich zu \u00e4hnlichen Produkten anderer Marken ist er deutlich g\u00fcnstiger, aber trotzdem von hoher Qualit\u00e4t und Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeit. F\u00fcr mich war dies die preiswerteste Alternative zu einem \u00e4hnlichen Produkt von Apple, das viel teurer ist.",
