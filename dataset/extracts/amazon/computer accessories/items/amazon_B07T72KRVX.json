The only complaint is choose where you stick it wisely if you have to remove it yet to remove the adhesive backing and then buy some new double-sided, tape and reapply it. The product is good. You just have to think wisely about where it\u2019s going to go so it doesn\u2019t have to be removed. There are a lot of options with it though and it prevents cables from falling behind the desk or dresser or other furniture.",
