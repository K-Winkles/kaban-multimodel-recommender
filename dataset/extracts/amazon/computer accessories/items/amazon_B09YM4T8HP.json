Six preset colors and 7 preset modes with the ability to customize the speed of color transition, the static colors, the brightness, and a few other things from the remote. I am not using the app, as my laptop Bluetooth is bad. Sorry that I can't speak on that. I included pictures of the light facing you and vice versa (sorry for the low quality - my phone was over-exposing the photos, so I had to edit the photos to make them at least somewhat representative of what I see). It's very easy to see the individual LED's so I turn it away to have the ambient light without having to turn on my room light. The remote control is very easy to use, and doesn't need to have a crazy straight line to the receiver to work properly. It doesn't have a wall plug, only the USB cable the lights use, so you'll either need to use your PC's USB port or a phone charger to power it.",

                "reviewText": "These DS 22INCH Aluminum Alloy Desk Moon Light are pretty cheaply constructed and work very poorly. Immediately out of the box several of the LEDs refuse to stay one color and only stop flashing if they're set to one solid color. The stands themselves are very cheap plastic and won't take much to accidentally break. Overall these are definitely not a high quality product and you might want to skip them.",

                "reviewText": "Item: \"DS Rainbow Smart Lighting Tower Starter Kit for Copmuter Monitor RGB Mood, Ambient Lighting with Music Sync Modes, APP Control Desk Moon Lighting for Movies, PC, TV, Game Room(2 Pack, Z Series)\"~I like using these instead of bright overhead lights in my apartment; it feels a lot more fun, plus being more eye-friendly. They get pretty bright, so unless you need to see little details, like for reading or cutting food with a sharp knife, they work as full-room lights all on their own.They were easy to put together, and the quality feels good. There are pads on the bottom of the light stands / bases so they won't scratch up a surface you set them on.I didn't put the app onto my phone until recently. The remote does a pretty good job without needing the app, though it's definitely easier to see all of the options that are available in the app (and there are a lot; I didn't realize how many when I was only using the remote).I wish I could connect directly to the lights, rather than needing to give the app location access and having it invisibly find the lights for me - it kind of bothers me that it hides the connection behind what feels like a bit of a black box.The app also has a schedule mode where you can tell it when to come on. I didn't try using that, since I find it pretty startling if lights randomly turn on without me doing it, and if I've lost track of time I can see myself jumping a bit from that.~The music sync can work either with the microphone attached to the lights' cables, or through playing music in the app.If you do it through the microphone, it has options as far as what kind of animation the lights do, but it has a really short range and also picks up on random sounds that aren't part of the song (I guess this is something where it has to balance range vs excessive sensitivity).If you do it through the app, as far as I can tell it only blinks between colors (looks neater than it sounds, though I'd prefer having all of the options), but it syncs better since there are no extra sounds affecting it. It has a few different playback modes - repeat one song, play all in order, and shuffle.It seems to sync semi-decently. It's not perfect - sometimes in a slow part it doesn't slow down as much as it seems like it should, and other times in a fast part it seems to be going a bit too slow - but overall it feels like it matches the pace and energy of the song. I'm not quite sure what parts of the music it's syncing to - some combination of drums / beat, and guitar / melody, I think.~Overall, they're fun to have, and I'm happy with them. I usually have them in a rainbow gradient mode, where it fades one color into the next and slides it up or down the poles. \ud83c\udf08",

                "reviewText": "When I unboxed these I enjoyed the build quality as the framing of the lights is a texturized aluminum and a plastic base, they are lightweight but don't feel cheap so it was a good experience. Upon setup one of the LED's looked like it was not putting off any green light so I thought they may be defective but after a minute the problem went away and never happened again. Not sure what happened but glad it was fixed. These are great for ambience around a screen or some mood lighting but they are definitely not bright enough to give you good definitive lighting for a room. Simply put they do exactly as they advertise, they look good, and they modes all seem to work as stated.",

They're just the right level of brightness and the mics for the sound settings are just sensitive enough to pick up almost everything, but not every little sound you might make turning on your computer/tv/etc. They're super easy to install (either plug it into the usb port on your tv/computer or find an extra power cube laying around) and easy to control. The settings are great, and they're just bright enough to add ambience, but not tire your eyes out!Definitely worth the purchase!",
