                "reviewText": "I hate smudges, finger prints and dust so I tend to clean my TV screens religiously. I've been using window cleaner up until now but I just bought a $2800 OLED TV and a $1000 OLED monitor. So I wanted something besides window cleaner, which you're not supposed to use on TVs but I never cared about it until I dropped a lot of money on these two items.This cleaner turns out to be the best cleaner for EVERYTHING. TVs, monitors, smart phone screens, your smart watch and even glasses. Plus it's easy. Spray it on a microfiber cloth instead of the screen, then wipe the screen. I don't spray a lot on the cloth as it's extremely effective and evaporates almost instantly unless too much is used. If I have sprayed too much I just wipe the screen with the dry side of my cloth. The results I get every time are a smudge free sparkling screen with zero streaks or spots.It's a godsend for glasses. I wear glasses and 100% hate smudges. I keep a bottle of eyeglass cleaner (like the kind you get at the eye doctor) and a microfiber cleaning cloth around me at all times and I end up cleaning my glasses at least 20 times a day whenever I notice they are no longer crystal clear.Well, I've emptied all of those bottles and filled them up with this cleaner. It easily cleans my glasses and makes them crystal clear. The kind of clean I get after cleaning them twice with the regular stuff I used to use.",

I use this on my security cameras to clean the lens and it works like magic. It seems like it coats it in something that protects it. I only have to clean the cameras once a month now with this. Laptop screen looks like new when I use it on it. TV screens come out like crystal clear. Before it was multiple different screen cleaners but now it is one for all. The cloth is comes with is super soft. I use that on the delicate screens like the camera's lens.",

I built an exhaust fan for my smoke, portable AC duct and computer fan, so it's not like I sit in clouds of smoke, as most of it goes out the duct, the window is always open too cause the 7990 vid card is a mini furnace... anyway, so many years of cleaning left in bottle and it worked great for me.",
