It offers not only an ergonomic solution for my dual monitors but also extra-large storage capacity, which helps keep my desk tidy and organized. The two drawers are incredibly handy for stashing away various office essentials, from stationery to small gadgets.This monitor stand is sturdy and well-built, providing a safe and elevated platform for my dual monitors. As someone who spends a lot of time at the computer, the added screen height has made a noticeable difference in reducing strain on my neck and eyes. It's easy to assemble, and the minimalist design adds a touch of sophistication to my desk.I can't recommend this enough, especially if you're looking for an all-in-one solution to declutter your workspace and improve your monitor setup. It's been a game-changer for my productivity and overall comfort.",

                "reviewText": "My desk was just one of the many in this country that suffers from clutter, so I saw this stand and the drawers and thought \"hell, why not.\" Got it and it was so easy to put together! They even included a cute little screwdriver, and there were extras of the screws needed. The size of it is great! I only have one monitor right now, but the size of the stand definitely has renewed my interest in getting another monitor. I also love the little stand where I can put my iphone and my ipad in! It's making me interested in also using my ipad to draw again.The only caveat is that the space in the middle is too small to fit my keyboard. I have to move my keyboard off to the side to use my huion tablet, and change from using my keyboard shortcuts to using the buttons on my tablet. Which isn't a huge issue, but it changes my art workflow and is slightly annoying. But, the stand is already pretty large, so I can understand not wanting to make it *too* big. So this is just a warning that your keyboard will probably not be able to fit in that empty space in the middle!Other than that, I'm happy with the purchase! Cute drawers, easy to put together, nice space. Now to look into another monitor...",

                "reviewText": "This riser fits my needs. I have 2 external monitors that I hook up to a laptop and until I got this riser I was using books to lift my monitors to an acceptable height. This riser looks nice on my desk and serves its purpose well. I wanted the all black one but had to get the grey/black one instead b/c it would have taken too long for the all black one to arrive. I find that a bit frustrating. Why would one color ship quicker than another? My only criticism is about the fabric drawers. They do not slide in and out very easily and the flimsy dividers are more a nuisance than useful. I ditched the dividers and put a couple of wooden drawer organizers inside and that is working well; actually improved the way the drawers slide in and out. Assembly was super easy and the instructions were simple to follow. Overall, a good value.",
