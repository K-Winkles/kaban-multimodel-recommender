                "reviewText": "The premise behind this light/stand is great, but it\u2019s so badly made.There\u2019s no instructions for assembly or operation.I felt like I was going to break it putting it together.There are no lights to indicate if it has power or anything.It has one \u2018touch spot\u2019 that operates everything.And it will randomly turn on depending on the USB port you\u2019re using to power it.I like the design, but it needs better materials, controls, and information.",

                "reviewText": "I got this item to help minimize the clutter on my desk. I use it for 3 headsets, 2 of them are resting on the top plastic holder, and the 3rd is resting on top of those two headsets which is more than it is designed for, but it works and looks fine. I am reviewing this on my LIveStream, and one of my viewers said that the RGB makes it look cheap, which I agree with but I leave it on pink and I like it. I use the bottom mounts for two controllers I use most often. The one complain I have, is that the bottom isn't weighted and so if there are only things being mounted on the top, it will fall over. The materials are plastic all around. The mount has two USB ports, I plugged in a USB C cable and a USB micro cable for versatility. Overall, I think it works well because it is condensed and saves alot of space and will charge your devices.",

                "reviewText": "I chose this product in particular because it had 4 different hooks and could simultaneously hold a variety of different things including game controllers. The 4 hooks give me the ability to place up to 4 gaming controller, or 2 controllers along with a pair of headphones, making it the perfect product for anyone who has a desk gaming setup. The base seems pretty solid and the RGB lights look amazing, especially at night when it's dark. I did feel as though the rod seemed a little less sturdy then the base, and the connection inside was a little difficult for me to put through since the wire was a little long and kept getting in the way, but it's a small problem in an otherwise awesome product. It also has two USB ports so you can charge something or plug in another accessory.Pros:- Awesome RGB lights with multiple efffects- Contains 2 USB Slots to plug in other accessories- Freedom to hold either 4 controllers, or 2 controllers + headphonesCons:- Wire took a few minutes for me to plug in since it was really long and kept getting in the way- The RGB pole seemed a little flimsy compared to the solid base.Overall, a fantastic product for anyones desk gaming setup.",
