I even applied one to my tablet and you barely know its there unless you look for it. I like the security of covering the camera and this little gadget does the job perfectly. I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "My work computer is a very recent Microsoft Surface Pro laptop. Not sure of the model number, but it's definitely within the last year or two. The camera is located at the top of the bezel, behind the same glass that covers the entire laptop screen. These camera covers adhere to to the front camera with ease, and the laptop closes just fine. I wouldn't SLAM the cover down for fear of breaking the glass... but I wouldn't do that even without installing this camera cover.My \"personal\" computer is a Microsoft Surface Pro tablet which is about 6 years old. It also has a front-facing camera which is mounted behind the top of the bezel, behind the same glass that covers the entire screen. I usually keep it in the docking station on my desk at home. Sometimes, I take it with me when I travel. When I travel, I put it in a \"folio\" cover and use a \"Type\" keyboard cover. This camera cover adheres to the front camera very well, and will fit in my folio cover.Both camera covers are easy to attach, and work simply by sliding the round part left/right to cover or uncover the camera.These covers will probably work on the rear camera of my Surface Pro tablet as well, but I don't have much need for covering that camera since that cameras is usually facing the rear of my desk (or a desk in a hotel room) and/or the wall behind the desk.To those who complained about the adhesive not sticking well enough... I have to wonder whether they bothered to clean the glass before attaching the camera cover. I dampened a paper towel with glass cleaner, cleaned the area on/around the camera, and then dried the surface of the glass with a dry paper towel before attaching the camera cover. The camera covers on both computers seem very well attached to the glass.",
