                "reviewText": "I loved the idea of these clips. How many of us have cords at our night stands, coming up from behind our desk, kitchen counters, etc. They hold the cords from dropping down behind what they are laying on. I found them easy to use, easy to open and held the cord in place. One drawback. The adhesion needs to be stronger. Some cords are heavy and have some weight. These clips are having trouble with that, and if you open and close them a bunch it pyres them off. Have heavy duty double sticky tape ready to replace. That's why I gave them 4 stars. Great idea, better adhesion is recommended.",
