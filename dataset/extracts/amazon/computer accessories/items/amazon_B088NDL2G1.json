                "reviewText": "This is a great mouse to have if you are trying to have a mouse that can be used on a type c only device while keeping the option of normal USB open. What I most enjoy about this is the RGB lights. I love having it light up and it's cool thing to have in my office. If you want to use the type c port. It will need to be attached via adapter. The adapter will stick out unfortunately so be careful as you can damage the adapter. It does have a slot so you can install the dongle (not the adapter) to the mouse itself. The default plug is just a normal USB port. The mouse feels pretty nice. It does feels pretty smooth and the black unfortunately does leave a bit of finger oils if you happen to have oily finger tips. There is no real lag or drifting with this mouse. It does have a built in battery which is super nice. You are able to just recharge the mouse by plugging it directly into your laptop via micro USB. The cable is a bit short unfortunately. I was able to use it for quite some time before the battery died. It does have a sleep mode from what I can tell to save battery life when you are not using it but it does have an ON and OFF button if you need it. The mouse moves pretty well across most surfaces and clicking is pretty responsive. I would say light gaming will work with this mouse if you really needed to. I would say the distance is pretty decent. I was able to go across the room and the mouse still connected pretty well. The black is a nice color but I am afraid with over long period uses the black will start to fade. The LED light works pretty well with the color. You can adjust the color via the center button. The bottom has pads but they are not the soft silicone like pads. It feels like a hard material. This is a plug in play and works great with mac and PC. I was able to use this on my macbook with ease although you may not be able to use certain features with this mouse. It does not look like it has a way of adjusting the DPI but it has a pretty good default DPI already so I do not see the need for adjusting. There is however no back or forward button on this mouse. Overall I think this is a good cheap mouse to have if you are looking for something that works with the new macs but gives you the option of working with older PC. It is a simple plug and play but the down side is that the mouse is a bit cheap feeling and the dongle is going to be much larger than many others as they give you both options.",

That means that if you run out of gas in the middle of an essay or working with something important you will end your work with a mouse connected on the front, making it quite hard to use.A good thing? It has colored light that changes and it makes it more visible if working late with just a laptop's light and it also is cool, bah.",

I like this mouse because of the smaller size ergonomics, rubberized texture, and the fine-tuning of the rubberized scroll wheel.One mouse started acting up and would not hold a charge, working only as long as it was plugged in. It was past the standard Amazon warranty and I contacted the distributor. After a couple of exchanges to evaluate the extent of the problem, they quickly mailed out a replacement. Doesn't get any better than that.",
