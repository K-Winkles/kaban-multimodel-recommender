I love that they come in two different sizes and they stick so well, I put one on my wall. Maybe that was a bad idea. Haven\u2019t taken it off yet so I\u2019m not sure yet. They hold the cords extremely well, the other day I tripped over one and it still was in place soooo yes great grip & hold. This was exactly what I needed to keep my cords organized.The adhesion is great it\u2019s durable and easy to use and stick on, I stuck it on a metal cart, and one I stuck on my wall, and they work great!!",

This one is nice and gummy and it does not budge when glued on. I Also like that you can choose different colors.",
