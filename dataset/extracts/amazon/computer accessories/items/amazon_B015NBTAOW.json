Different color makes it easy to identify if you work in a common space. Durable, as I have dropped it a couple of times and it continues to work without fail. Highly recommend.",

My son also used it and indicated he really liked it. I am going to order him one too. It takes a couple batteries, but the battery compartment is easy to access and closes securely so I don't anticipate problems with that. I appreciate that it came in a variety of colors so the mouse isn't confused with the traditional black-on-black mouse laying around the office and at home. I can tell it's mine because it's blue.",

I have no problems with it jumping or stuttering. It auto enters a low power mode when not used for some time, and it takes one click of the left button to activate it. That's become automatic for me now. A great mouse for a great price.",

After many years of using the mouse pad on my older laptop, the mouse pad doesn't work very well. So my new mouse, allows me to use with multiple laptops. I just love it and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a mouse for an old laptop or newer laptop.D. Blanchard",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a mouse with side buttons, as they are very useful while browsing and in file systems and can be configured. I initially looked for Logitech mice, but the cheapest option was 1800 rupees, which is very expensive. I finally settled at this mouse, and this is pretty much everything you can ask for in a mouse at a great price point.SIZE:It is perfectly sized for most users (see picture, I have pretty average-sized hands). Ergonomics are great, and it is a joy to hold in the hand. There is rubber padding on the thumb area, which adds extra gripBUTTONS & DPI:There are 5 DPI settings, and the mouse is configured at default of 1200 DPI. The main buttons on the mouse are clicky and have great feel and feedback. The DPI button is a bit loose, but again, not much to worry about as we don't change DPI frequently. The side buttons also have a bit of play in them, but I got used to it in a couple days. Mouse wheel has a good texture and grip to it.WEIGHT:The mouse uses 2 AAA cells that attach at the back, so it is slightly back-heavy. Overall the weight is normal, not excessively heavy or light. The receiver attaches magnetically into the mouse, and no need to open flaps to access it.Cannot comment on the battery life since haven't used it for that long. 18 months warranty is good though. The mouse is sturdy, I accidentally dropped it once but no scuffs or cracksOverall I am highly satisfied with the purchase. I wish the weight distribution was a bit more even, but considering the price point and all the other features, it is an easy recommendation.",

Battery life is EXCELLENT! So glad I didn't buy the cheaper ones out there on the market. This mouse has far exceeded my expectations and considering I use it 15 hours a day with no issues, I am happy with my purchase. It works great for my studies, gaming, browsing, laptop DJ sets and more! Thank you Tecknet :) Sticking to your brand from now on, and I have had enough of Microsoft mouse products. TECKNET for the win! :) 5 stars!",

This mouse has QUALITY switches for its left and right click buttons, AND a quality mouse wheel. The side buttons are in a perfect position, they easily help for productivity and overall usability.It arrived undamaged, and packaged nicely in a \"frustration-free\" product box.I should say that it is small- to medium-sized, overall. It is NOT tiny. For most people it will be comfortable to use. People with large hands might complain, but then, why wouldn't you be looking for a gaming mouse instead if you had large hands? Gaming mice have become much less expensive anyway. :) However, my hands are somewhat large myself, and I still find this mouse to be comfortable, nevertheless.",
