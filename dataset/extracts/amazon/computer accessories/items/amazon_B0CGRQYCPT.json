            "\u30107.5 mm Perfect Cable Slot Diameter\u3011Diameter of 0.3 inches (7.5mm) can hold most cables, such as phone charging cables, USB cords, HDMI thick cables, computer power cords, etc. Besides that, the slot diameter of 7.5mm can perfectly hold a charging head as small as the iPhone original silicone charging cable without falling off, and the held cable can be pulled out smoothly for use.",
            "\u3010Magnetic Clamp Design\u3011The unique magnetic opening and closing cable clip design allows you to place and remove cables with only one hand. Unlike other cord holders on the market, Joyroom cable organizer uses a sophisticated 60\u00b0 rotating shaft and magnetic locking cord design, helping you easily snatch a cord off or easily add a cord easily.",
            "\u3010Enhanced No-Residue Acrylic Adhesive\u3011The Upgraded Acrylic Adhesive sticky pad allows the cable organizer to stick firmly to almost any flat& clean surface, such as wooden tables, glass, ceramic tiles, etc. Meanwhile, the transparent removable acrylic adhesive pad will not damage your desktop, wall, no residue left after removal. A replacement stick pad is also included in the box, making it possible to reuse the cord holder.",
            "\u3010Makes Your Cables Organized\u3011Joyroom cable Organizer could hold cables in place firmly and keep them off the floor. More importantly, the 6-pack set allows you to keep cords toward neat traces as you wish, such as setting them on the office desktop, tableside, table corner, wall, or car dashboard.",
            "\u3010Thoughtful Details\u3011The ultimate width of 0.87 inch cord holder allows it to be firmly fixed in most narrow spaces. Joyroom cable organizer does not take up too much sticking area, and it can be perfectly hidden in any small corner you care about. [Kindly Installation Tips: Please clean the desired surface without dust before sticking, and keep pressing for 30 seconds to enhance the adhesion of the sticky pad. Highly recommend waiting for 12-24 hours for better use].",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I usually keep my laptop charger at my desk, but whenever I would unplug to grab my laptop, the charger plug would fall behind my desk. This works great to hold the plug right where I can grab it. Even better, I don't even have to open the holder to use the charger. I can just pull the cord through, plug it in, and when I'm done using it, the plug just slides back down to the holder. I can even use it this with with my standing desk riser. Perfect to use these to hold both a laptop and cell phone cord, and easy to open when I want to grab the whole charger. The hinge has just enough stiffness and the magnetic closure just enough strength where doesn't pull open accidentally from the cord brushing it, but opens very easily if lightly pulled against. The adhesion to the wall is very strong. Be careful placing them! I lightly touched to to the wall and then wanted to adjust slightly, and nope! It was already very strongly adhered. Slightly concerned it will take the paint with it when/if I need to take them off. But until then, very happy \ud83d\ude02 I only wish they had a multi-color pack, with 3 black 3 white, as I didn't need 12 of them to get both packs. But other than that, highly recommend.",

Super functional. I opted to get the bigger pack because you just never know how many you\u2019ll use. I think it\u2019s worth getting the bigger pack.",

This is so elegant and easy and allows the cord to stay up and on the side of the little table I have it stuck to. Just get these. It saves all the reaching and leaning down. The phone charging cord is now so easy to reach because of this little holder. No brainer. It's perfect.",
