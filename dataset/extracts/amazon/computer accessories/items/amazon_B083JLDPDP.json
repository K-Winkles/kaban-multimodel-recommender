                "reviewText": "I have two of these headset mounts: one at work and one at my home office. I regularly have online teleconferences and used to \"store\" my headset on the bottom shelf of my office desk; basically just tossed it onto the shelf. When my old headset mic broke, I finally decided to look for a solution and found these monitor mounts. I now have my headset safely stored on these great mounts within easy reaching distance on the side of my monitor. Highly recommend these mounts as they only take a few minutes to install. Be sure to read the instructions before you start as they work well but you do need to install them correctly. You'll love the sturdiness and convenience.",

Instead it attaches to the side of your monitor (either right or left). There are three pieces to this which inlcude the component that attaches to the monitor, the bar the headset sits on and a rubberized pad that goes along with the bar. It attaches using 3 Command strips which are easy to use and easy to remove. I use Command strips in other uses and always have a ready supply. Install took about 3 minutes. The instructions were clear and illustrated to help you through the process. Works for corded and wireless headsets.",

It said it would work on curves, and that even if a couple of the strips connected it would be fine, but mine is apparently *too* curved.It still ended up working and does hold my headphones, but since about half of the adhesive is not attached to my monitor, I'm not sure how long it will stay. But it's handy and nice to keepy headset off my desk.Just wish the mount piece was a little more flexible so it could fit more screen types, better.",
