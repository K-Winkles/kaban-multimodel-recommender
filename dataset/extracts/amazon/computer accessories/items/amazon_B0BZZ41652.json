                "reviewText": "These are a good deal for the price range. I like to watch videos, listen to live animal cams, and listen to police scanner. These work great for those things without breaking the bank. If you want really high quality, you have to spend a bit more than I am willing to. I wish the default setting was a bit higher so I didn't have to adjust at the speaker, just at pc but that really is not that inconvenient just an observation. I didn't give 5 stars because we all know if you spend more there is better out there but these are a great bargain and sound good.",
