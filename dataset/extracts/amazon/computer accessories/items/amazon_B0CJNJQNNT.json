                "reviewText": "This is a very clever device. I previously used a much larger, bulky thing on which you place a mouse. It physically moved around, thus making the mouse's sensor think it was moving on a surface. It also was noisy and took up valuable desk space. This product, on the other hand, simply plugs into a spare USB port, either A or C, since it includes an adaptor for whatever you have on your computer. There are no drivers to download, it appears to work on both my Mac and Windows computers, and is quiet. Just plug it in, push the button, and it starts to work immediately. You can see the cursor moving on its own around the screen.The problem with this product is that it keeps moving the cursor when I need to actually use the mouse, move it where I want it to go, and click on things. I had assumed that this thing would automatically sense when I use the mouse and cease moving the cursor itself, but it doesn't. It keep moving the cursor on its own, which makes using the mouse pretty close to impossible. The only \"solution\" I've found is to turn the unit off when I need to use the mouse myself and then turn it back on when I'm finished, which is a pretty inefficient way to work. If this device could sense when I want to use the mouse and stop itself from working, I'd give it five stars. If that's possible, I didn't see it described in the tiny sheet of instructions, which, by the way, you will probably need a magnifying glass to read.",

                "reviewText": "This tiny USB-A \"mouse jiggler\" device is easy to use, just plug it in to a USB-A port on your computer (or a hub) or use the included USB-A to USB-C adapter (which I haven't tried yet since I have plenty of USB-A ports on a hub) and push the single button on it when you want to turn it on. Once it is on the green LED on it lights up and the cursor will move around randomly without any motion on the mouse, pushing the button again toggles between very large motions and smaller motions of the cursor. The large motions might cover several inches on a monitor in a second or two while the the smaller motions maybe only an inch or two. The mouse will still work while this device is on... However in my experience with this device on in either mode it is very difficult to actually use the mouse due to the random motions, which continue even if you are actively moving the mouse and underlay whatever motions you make with the mouse. In the large motion mode the mouse is virtually impossible to use and in the small motion mode the mouse is just very difficult to actually use. There is no mode that only 'jiggles' the cursor by a pixel or two, if there were such a mode that only moved a couple of pixels per second the mouse might still be useful with this turned on, but as it is you need to disengage this with a long press on the single button before you can effectively use your mouse again. I often end up doing a short press and thus switching between small and large motion mode a couple of times before I remember that you cannot 'toggle' it to off mode by short button presses and it takes a long press to turn it off, which is mildly annoying but I'll eventually get used to that.This mouse jiggler does keep a computer 'awake' and unlocked, but it would be much more useful if it had three modes: large, small, and 1 pixel. It would be even more useful if it could somehow detect real mouse motion and 'go to sleep' while the mouse is being used, waking up again if there have been no mouse motions in a while.",
