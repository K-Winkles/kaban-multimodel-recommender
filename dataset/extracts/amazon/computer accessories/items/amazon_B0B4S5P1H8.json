                "reviewText": "Yes I did lose one of the attachments all were included. Comes with the 3 brushes, 4 blower attachments (one with a brush on it) and a short charging cord. What this works great for is cleaning out dust, crumbs, or small anything from a desk, pc, etc. This does not work for inflating inflatables, blow drying hair, or anything requiring high air flow. This is more designed for fine targeted flow of air rather than a large volume. It has 3 power settings, low medium high, each ramping it up a little more. The included attachments work great to help loosen up pieces of debris that may be to stuck to initially be blow away. Battery life is quite short about 5-10 minutes on high before it runs out. If you using this as a replacement for canned air and use that a lot you would need probably two of these to switch between as they charge. Overall I have liked it a lot for my routine PC and keyboard cleanings. Probably has lots more uses so never know until you give it a try!Summary:Lots of attachments+Good for Dust, Small Debris, crumbs+Rechargeable+Included carrying bag+Not for inflating, hair drying, or anything high air flow-Short battery life-Noisy (Louder than most hair dryers)-",

                "reviewText": "This Air Duster was a total impulse buy, and I am really happy I ordered it! It arrived well-packaged, with lots of little attachments, and a storage bag that fits everything in it. For it's size and what it is, it's surprisingly powerful! I used it to dust out the inside of a piano; it was significantly easier than dragging a compressor into the house. I also used it for cleaning lint & threads from a sewing machine- the little brushes help with that, and I don't have to keep buying canned air. Also used it to inflate some small pool toys- quick & easy! I can see how it can be useful dusting house plant leaves and little delicate knick-knack items. It has good (obviously translated, but still) instructions. My only complaint is that it's a little on the loud side, but I can deal if it makes cleaning easier!",
