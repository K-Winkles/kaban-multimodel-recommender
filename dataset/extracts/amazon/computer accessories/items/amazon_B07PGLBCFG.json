                "reviewText": "Highly recommended! Footrest is comfortable for my foot size (13) men's and the Cool Gel memory foam is both supportive and cushion soft at the same time. The bottom non-slip micro beaded surface keeps the footrest from slipping around. The removable cover appears to be of high quality micro velour type material and is stated to be washable, however I have not needed to wash it as yet. When not in use the rest can be easily tucked or stored away. Provides tremendous elevated lower leg fatigue relief when seated for long work or gaming sessions.",

I no longer have lower back pain, I no longer have stains on the wall where my feet used to go (gross but you know what I'm talking about).The cushion is versatile and I love the fact that you can remove the outer liner and wash just like normal. The texture is soft and PERFECT for bare feet or with socks on. I don't use with shoes because that feels wrong (though I suppose you could.)Overall, a fantastic product that I should have purchased a long time ago.",

I got two of my friends on it too, we are a bunch of computer scientists who just need all the help we can get as we sit on our desk most days coding away.a bonus is that you can take off the cover for it, so you can put it in the washer to clean it every so often.",
