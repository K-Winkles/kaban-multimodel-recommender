Its super small and light weight making it a go to for travel and cafe' office at hotels and airports",

The cool thing about this is that it can work with either a USB-A or USB-C host computer. This is perfect for him because he has an old hand-me-down laptop which does not have USB-C, but his next laptop definitely will have.On the hub there are two USB-C connectors one of which can be used to give the hub power, if you are using it on a USB-A host.This thing is so much smaller than I thought it would be, and it will be perfect for those who travel.",
