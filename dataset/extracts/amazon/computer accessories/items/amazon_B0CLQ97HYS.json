I didn\u2019t realize how much I was looking down to look at my laptop screen until I am now looking forward!The stand is super thick and sturdy.The area underneath is large enough that you can fit your stapler and ruler, pens, pencils, pads of paper, sticky note dispensers the possibilities are endless. Actually creates more desk space! Things that were out in the middle of your desk can now be tucked underneath your computer! My laptop is more than an inch wider than the stand, but it is still very sturdy and stable. It also hangs off the back many inches but again it is still very stable. I love it. I honestly never even considered a laptop stand but I love it!I use a separate keyboard I don\u2019t think it would be comfortable using the laptop keyboard, on top of the stand it would be too tall. my full-size keyboard does not fit underneath the stand either just for reference.I worried that the hot pink would be obnoxious, but with the laptop on top, you barely even notice the pink. You can see it on the front edge but other than that it\u2019s not obnoxious at all.",

                "reviewText": "I love this laptop riser, and here are the reasons why:1. I almost didn't order it for my bedroom, because I have just a little pink, but more red accents and wanted to bring in the red more..and guess what!? To me, on my white wood desk, with white leather chair and lamp on it..it has a more subtle red undertone! This laptop riser looks clear with a subtle red hue..not an obvious coloring..which is very attractive and looks and feels solid and upscale.2. NO assembling! At All. All in one piece and ready to use!3. Perfect height and width. I have a laptop with a seperate keyboard I use..which made my laptop to far away..if this makes sense, and I had trouble seeing my screen..well, now my laptop is higher over my keyboard closer to me!4. No more looking down.. obviously..not good on the back when working from home.I was worried to order as I am picky with keeping my decor a certain upscale/ cute/ comfortable/ while being useful theme..this riser fits the bill for working at home while looking cute needs",

An added benefit is I gained extra working space because of the lift. The stand is well crafted and my laptop fits perfectly on it. I love the pink color. If you do not like pink items then this would not be for you because it is very pink. The color adds some fun and brings out my office space.",

                "reviewText": "This acrylic stand is such a nice addition to our office desk. It not only adds some color to the desk, but is functional as it adds some space to the desk. It is very sturdy and I like how it is clear, so it is easy to identify what is under it so nothing gets lost there. It can hold the weight of my computer monitor very well and there is still more space to hold other knick knacks on the sides. The only thing that I would prefer with this product is straight edges instead of curved because it is very easy for items to fall off the side if they\u2019re placed near the edge, but it is aesthetic with the curved edges, so it is still a very nice product.",

It raises the laptop to an ideal height for viewing if you\u2019re using a standard height desk or table.I was using a puzzle box to raise my laptop to a good viewing height but this stand is perfect in height and looks really nice.

                "reviewText": "The transparent acrylic stand is heavy-duty and good for even the biggest monitor you might have.The unfortunate news is that the standard DELL Latitude laptop is about 1/2 inch wider than the riser allows. The riser doesn't have cutouts for USB ports, so to plug in my USB-C monitor on the side would be impossible to connect.",

                "reviewText": "This may be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen on a work desk. What a nice touch to add attractive color to a high quality monitor riser. It raises the desktop monitor and simultaneously adds space to the desk. It is smooth 0.4 inch thick acrylic in a polished sleek shape. It easily holds a large monitor in a stable position and height, and it could be used for many other office or home devices as well. Everyone who has seen it on my desk has commented on \"the look\". Highly recommend!",
