This pink keyboard utilizes keycaps made of PBT material, featuring a semi-transparent design that enhances light transmission with a softer glow. Moreover, these keycaps are more durable and resistant to wear, ensuring long-lasting performance. Is this a mechanical keyboard? How loud is this keyboard? It\u2019s a membrane keyboard. It's relatively quiet it only makes noise if you're pressing keys rapidly and hard. Is there a way to set this keyboard to just one color? There are only three modes, which are light off, light on and breathing effect. You can control the speed of the breathing effect. Can this keyboard change the switches? No, it can't. This is a membrane keyboard, not a mechanical keyboard, so the switches cannot be replaced. However, the keycaps can be removed for cleaning. Is this keyboard suitable for gaming? Certainly, it can be used for gaming, but I would recommend it more for everyday office use or as a decorative addition to your workspace.",

I wasn't interested in buying a top of the line product so I just went with a cheap $30 option. I'm very impressed with this! It feels so premium for the price.I love the mouse, it's smooth to touch and easy to use. I love the keyboard keys, they aren't loud to type on and feel nice to press. The lights on the keyboard are very eye pleasing to look at and you can turn them off to conserve power at the press of a button. The brightness is just fine and don't need to be brighter. Overall I have zero issues with this keyboard and mouse combo, it's definitely worth having. It really made me happy when my gaming PC powered on for the first time and this keyboard and mouse was there to make that experience even more exciting.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this keyboard when my MX keys (warranty replacement) stopped working after 6 months and then purchased the MX keys Mechanical keyboard (2 weeks ago) and no matter what I did I could not get 2 of my 3 computers to recognize it. Totally frustrated when Logitech ignored my support tickets, emails and messages. I decided to pack it back up and return it. That is when I discovered the Dacoity Gaming Keyboard. On a hunch that it was going to be a winner, I ordered Two of them which arrived 6 hours later in perfect condition. My first observation after unpacking it was it's solid feel, metal plating and perfect sized keys. Then I plugged it in to my computer and it came to life, Instantly I was overwhelmed with the colored backlighting and the feeling it gave me while typing. I didn't need to search for instructions anywhere like its overpriced competitors. It was off the races for me and performed so well that I cleared the backlog created while I was trying to get my brand new $185.00 Logitech Mechanic to work was quickly taken care of. If you are on the fence I suggest you buy one or two and see how you feel about everything I have said not to mention you could have 8 of these for the same price as 1 super techy overpriced keyboard which couldn't even connect with all its dongles, drivers, software and lack of support. LOGITECH (BAD) and DACOITY (GOOD). Gotta go buy a few more for the future.Stay Safe,Peter DNY",

                "reviewText": "I love my mechanical keyboard but I needed something quieter. I didn\u2019t feel like paying the $120+ for a high end name. When I saw this, and read the reviews, I had to give it a try.First the RGB is just as bright as my other one, but it\u2019s not as customizable. Well I only paid $30 for this one so I\u2019m okay with that.Second, it\u2019s quiet, really quieter than I had expected. I still feel like I\u2019m pressing keys, I just don\u2019t have the loud clicks. Very happy with it.Last but not least, this thing feels really solid. Good heavy metal construction, really well thought out, and it feels like it should have cost 2x maybe 3x as much.The only cons for me would be the wrist rest, there is a slight rest built into it and it\u2019s very comfortable. I just have a preference for a larger rest. Beyond that the USB cable feels flimsy. Again I paid like $30 for the kb and it\u2019s not a huge issue in my opinion.Bottom line, it works, it looks good, it feels good, and you really cannot beat the price.",

Lighting effects are simple but nice; I like to work with this keyboard at night, my desk lamp switched off. I must say I love it. First of all, for mechanical keyboard it is truly quiet. The keys feel great - typing is a pleasure. Unlike in many other keyboards, this one's keys do not become greasy (you will know what I mean if you ever used Razer or Redragon keyboards including the more expensive ones). It is very sturdy and feels satisfactorily solid. Everything works out of the box; you do not need to install any additional software, which always slows down your machine (I will admit I tried several software-driven and software-controlled gaming keyboards, and I invariably found them cumbersome and their software invasive). The Dacoity keyboard works, feels and looks like a much more expensive product. In this price range it is unbeatable. I bought one and when I realised how good it was, I purchased another. Get it while it is still cheap - and available. Like me, you will be a very happy camper!",

Non la giudico pertanto come tastiera gaming e non sono in grado di dire se pu\u00f2 essere valida anche a questo scopo. Come tastiera da scrittura per il prezzo \u00e8 molto conveniente. Ha molte qualit\u00e0 e pochi difetti. Ha una retroilluminazione molto efficace e un po' \"appariscente\". Ma per quel che mi riguarda \u00e8 efficace, ben visibile e la luminosit\u00e0 si pu\u00f2 impostare su tre gradazioni diverse. E' molto silenziosa. Ha dei tasti che a differenza di molte tastiere anche pi\u00f9 costose non dovrebbero scolorirsi (come \u00e8 dichiarato esplicitamente dal produttore). E' una tastiera italiana vera, senza strane combinazioni di tasti. Tutto \u00e8 dove dovrebbe essere. Veniamo poi ai peccati veniali: un aspetto fastidioso \u00e8 che l'accensione della retroilluminazione \u00e8 devoluta a un grosso tasto posto in prima fila. Quindi facilissimo premerlo per sbaglio. Personalmente ho risolto mettendo una piccola \"zeppa\" sotto il tasto cos\u00ec da non poterlo schiacciare. E' d'altronde del tutto superfluo perch\u00e9 la retroilluminazione \u00e8 attivabile anche con la combinazione fn + pag dw e up. Per chi scrive con dieci dita come me l'escursione dei tasti non \u00e8 brevissima ma questo pu\u00f2 anche essere un vantaggio perch\u00e9 obbliga a premere bene ogni tasto evitando cos\u00ec battute accidentali. La tastiera \u00e8 robustissima perch\u00e9 montata su un telaio interamente di metallo. I tasti (se ho ben capito ma non ho provato) sono anche removibili per una eventuale pulizia profonda. Ha il tasto invio a \"L\" rovesciata ed \u00e8 quindi molto comodo, ha una barra spaziatrice che affonda senza piegarsi solo da un lato. Non necessita di pile perch\u00e9 viene alimentata dalla USB. Insomma a questo prezzo cosa volete di pi\u00f9?",

The lighting is super bright as well.Even though it's price is low, the value feels high. I'll buy a backup because I like it that much.",
