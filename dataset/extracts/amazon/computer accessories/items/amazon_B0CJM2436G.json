This can be set up on a table without much room, and adjusted to your needs in less than a minute. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

I use a separate blue tooth keyboard, since the laptop keyboard is elevated such that using the keyboard is not really practical, but that\u2019s OK with me. You could type on the laptop keyboard when in the stand, but that causes a bit of wobble, but its nothing that affect the security of your laptop when supported by the Urmust stand. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the product and would recommend it highly.",

Putting it on this stand, the screen is at a much more comfortable height. It feels stable, and not at all like it's going to fall over.The gaming laptop is a whole different beast. I'm impressed with the sturdyness of the stand, because the laptop is over 8lbs, which is just under the 10lbs limit the seller mentioned. It doesn't feel like it's going to collapse under the weight of my laptop. But compared to the size of the stand, the laptop is much larger, and it feels like my laptop could easily tip over if I accidentally touch one of the corners or tilt the screen back too much.",

If you do use it to type while laptop is on the stand, you'll be constantly holding your entire arms up.My wife mainly uses the stand for video calls where the laptop camera needs to be high.One thing to note. She has a surface book 2 (13 inch). When the laptop cover is closed, the volume button on the top of the display screen would hit the metal catching edge on the bottom stand. The metal catching edge on the bottom stand is there to catch and prevent the laptop from sliding off the stand. The volume control would make contact with the metal edge and cause the volume control to stick (if leaved closed long enough). When you turn on the laptop, Windows will constantly flash the volume control ON\\OFF (volume up\\down) because it thinks you're pressing/depressing the volume button. You'll need to slide the surface laptop to the left to prevent this issue.Other than this, the stand works great. Wife likes it and gets the job done for her.",

                "reviewText": "It's ironic isn't it? We all move onto laptops because of their convenience, but then we realise that laptops are not good for posture and we get aching necks and shoulders. So, it's a good thing that stands like these exist so you can use your laptop as a monitor, and add a separate keyboard and mouse, to turn it back into the desktop you used to have with a screen at a good height.This is a really solid auminium stand, which holds my laptop well. The box spanner supplied ensures that it's easy to adjust, and easy to tighten so it stays put. It's not ideal for a the largest recommended size 15.6in laptop if you don't have a spare keyboard handy, as you'll 'feel' the overhang when typing. The silicone pads do help hold it in place though, I had no worries about my laptop falling off the stand.",

However I was very pleasantly surprised and this stand is really excellent. It is extremely sturdy and once you adjust it to the height and slant you want, as it's made of very sturdy metal it locks in place so won't move when you put normal pressure on the laptop keyboard when typing, etc. It can be manoeuvred very high and much higher than another Kensington stand I've got. Absolute bargain and can't recommend enough. Also the foot space of the stand quite small so won't take up much valuable desk space and you can store any additional keyboard /mouse you may use under it which is very neat. Can't recommend enough and super bargain at price.",
