                "reviewText": "There are a lot of USB C docking stations available, and it's nice to have options, especially when different hubs offer different ports and capabilities. But sometimes that can be confusing when ports you think should be present or should work a certain way don't function as expected.So looking from that approach, rather than tell you what the hub has (which you can see by reading the description, I'll point out what it does NOT have. I don't mean for these to be criticisms, I just want to help searchers be sure whether this is or is not the hub they need.1) There is no USB C in port for data. The USB C port that it has is for Power Delivery, to charge the main host and help supply power across all the connections. But if you have a USB C phone, you will not be able to connect it directly to this hub.2) There is no USB 3.0 (or 3.1) type A (the old rectangular USB port). You can connect USB 2.0 devices, but 3.0 and 3.1 devices will only run at much slower 2.0 speeds. This is fine for keyboards, mice, etc...but will be a serious limitation if you want to use a high speed flash drive or external hard drive.I have tested the dual HDMI output and it works on PC. I have a Surface Pro, connected this to the USB C port, and monitors to each HDMI port, and was able to have a 3 screen setup working (Surface screen, + 2 1600x900 monitors.) I also run keyboard and mouse through the hub, and it works great. I saw notes that Mac users may have limitations in the types of screen arrangements they can set up, but I can't speak from experience.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried connecting my G15 to multiple displays using a few other docking stations in the past, and really didn't have any success with anything but the dell branded dock. This unit is amazing, it worked for my G15 flawlessly without needed to be plugged into a USB-C power supply, which was very unexpected for me! I used it to connect to two monitors, an HP and a Dell monitor with Display Port and HDMI connections, respectively. I then proceeded to stream 3 different videos on the three screens and it played them all without a hitch.I was also able to connect it to my Samsung S20 Ultra and it would have displayed to both monitors if they were the same resolution. It worked for about a minute or two, then one of them went into standby unless I unplugged and re-plugged in the USB-C connector. Haven't done a lot of testing with the phone, but it was interesting to play with and nice tool to keep in the back pocket.I really didn't know what to expect, but this is an awesome docking station. It is a third the size of the dell docking station, and much more aesthetically pleasing. The shell is made of aluminum, and the end caps are plastic. The cord is 12.75\" long and is thick, but flexible. It does not feel plastic-y or cheap. Not a lot else I can say about it, other than it just works!",

                "reviewText": "Nice little portable docking station, the materials feel like good quality. I tried it with Dell and Surface laptops, it works plug-and-play with two monitors (1 HDMI, 1 DisplayPort) extended or duplicated.As noted in the product description all 3 USB-A ports are type 2.0, which is fine for plugging in the receiver for a keyboard or mouse and OK for a USB drive, but data transfer rates are going to be more limited than a hub with USB-A 3.x ports.One thing to watch is that the hub impacts the power supply, so when using a 65W USB-C charger plugged into the power port of the hub, then into a laptop that requires a 65W source you get \u201cweak charge state\u201d and \u201cuse the charger supplied with your computer\u201d errors. The laptops do seem to charge, but error messages are certainly a concern. It seems to work fine if you go up one charge rating, i.e., a 65W charger hooked to the hub on a system that takes a 45W OEM charger, so this is something to take into consideration. I have not tested similar portable hubs with power pass-through, so I can't comment if this is typical or unique to this hub. If I test others and find it is not typical I will update this review (and adjust to 4 stars).",

                "reviewText": "I am very happy with this USB hub, I got this one specifically because it supports VGA and 4k60hz HDMI. Currently I am only using the VGA for my external monitor but am planning on upgrading to a 4k monitor in the next couple months. The VGA works great, have had no issues with it so far. Also the USB all is working great and the pass through charging works without issue. Compared to other products seems to have good features for the price.Things to note:1) The USB is 2.0 and not 3.0, which is a bit of a bummer although most people would probably never notice the difference, still nice to have.2) Check the specs before buying, this has 2 HDMI ports but one is only at 4k30hz. If you want two monitors at 4k60hz you need to use the DP and HDMI 1 port.3) Check your laptop specs and what it can handle, not all laptops can handle larger monitors especially through the USB C ports.",

It's doing the exact same thing as the OEM docking station is doing, without the high cost of an OEM docking station.It's small and dense. Feels well built. Actually takes up significantly less space than the docking station.The graphics are just as good as with the docking station.I'm using it for:1) Powering HP laptop with USB-C (Thunderbolt)2) Dual 27\" 1920x1080 monitors using one HDMI and one DisplayPort3) USB Camera/Headset & Phone ChargingThis device is performing wonderfully!Note: This requires a USB-C power supply (not included). My laptop came with a second power cable for travel, which is what I'm using to power this device.Two thumbs up!",
