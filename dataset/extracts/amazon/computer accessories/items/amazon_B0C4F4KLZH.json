                "reviewText": "I am one of those guys with a job that requires me to be on a computer all day, and I\u2019ve had jobs like this since college (from which I graduated 24 years ago). All these years of information-based work have caused some postural issues for me. In addition to physical therapy, I am trying to make my work space in my home office more ergonomic.Having a foot rest is essential, because it keeps me from slouching forwards when I work. It alleviates back & hip pressure. I could just stack up some books, but since I use this desk area a lot, I decided to get a real foot rest.I like the one I chose here because it\u2019s soft, comfortable and the cover is washable. I\u2019m not a big person so it doesn\u2019t take much to put my feet at the correct angle for optimum support. I feel like this foot rest is generously sized, so nearly anyone could use it. Also, the cover is machine washable, a nice plus. I bought the foot rest on a special deal so it was very affordable.Overall, I am very happy with this foot rest and recommend it for anyone with a desk job. Desk-jockey approved!!",

                "reviewText": "I love this for my feet under the desk and for my back while sitting in bed to read. I'll be getting a second one for sure so I'm not always moving it between the desk and the bed.Firm and soft: It is firm foam with a soft cover on one side (the angled side, and gripper on the bottom. It also has a zipper (on side and most of one edge) so the cover could be removed (but I haven't removed it yetfor cleaning - I would guess it could be washed okay , but air dry so it will fit back on the foam again after).I've been dusting it off each evening and putting a pillow case on it for reading (using it to support my lower back - against the headboard - while sitting on my bed). Then by day, it is under my feet at my desk.I would love to find this in a better shape for back support. The foam and cover are quality and the skid resistance is perfect to keep it from moving around using it. If not a better shape available I'll be buying this one again so I can use it without moving it around a lot.Note: I wouldn't need to use a pillow case on it if it wasn't on the floor all day lol - I'm just a bit OCD about it likely because I live with a cat who loves to stay by my feet most of the time.",

                "reviewText": "Where has this been all my life? I spend endless hours at my desk and this foot rest is perfect for positioning my feet. It's firm yet plush and also serves to keep my feet warm in cold weather. The angle of the hump is very good for my calves and Achilles - they stretch just enough that they're not stiff at the end of the day. This has broken me of the habit of hooking my feet on the chair runners - and my legs feel much better because of that at the end of the day.",
