The best part of this kit in my opinion is the brush that deep cleans all dust, dirt and whatever could get stuck between the keys. Use it gently though as it could rip the keys right off the board even though the brush is very soft. It comes with cleaning solution, a key remover and a fine cleaning instrument to get into crevices and places other kits may not reach as easily. The back has a felt that can be used to clean LCD screens and I think it would make a great addition to any laptop case for the quick cleanup if ever needed and the price is right for sure compared to other kits of the same quality. Its small, dependable and works...what more can you ask for in a cleaning kit for on the go!",

But when I got it out and flipped it over, it slid in and out a lot easier. The slide out brush is very nice. It wasn't easy to use the cleaning pad on the back of the case. The plastic hits the screen I was cleaning. It should be thicker to avoid that. I also cleaning my car dash radio with it. I'll bet there are lots of different things you can clean with this that we haven't thought of.",
