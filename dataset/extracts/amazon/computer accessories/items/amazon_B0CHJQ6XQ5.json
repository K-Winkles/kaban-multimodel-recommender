                "reviewText": "I like these simpler headphone stands that doesn't rotate since mine is wired. The RGB color is nice, covers half the tube. The base is nice and has two USB ports to charge your device, but I will refrain from using them as they might have interference from the stand itself (it's better to just charge directly from your PC than from another medium like this stand). The quality is OK, expected of this range. Overall good purchase!",

Anything that helps my kids remember to put things where they properly belong is a winner in my book!",
