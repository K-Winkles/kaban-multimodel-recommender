                "reviewText": "The Elgato Stream Deck Mini is a compact and powerful tool that revolutionizes content creation for streamers, video editors, and creative enthusiasts alike. Despite its smaller size compared to the standard Stream Deck, this mini version proves to be a game-changer with its intuitive design and seamless integration with various applications.First and foremost, the Stream Deck Mini's key feature is its six customizable LCD keys, each displaying icons of your choice. The key configurations are a breeze to set up using the user-friendly Stream Deck software, which allows you to assign a wide range of actions, hotkeys, and macros to the keys. From launching applications and switching scenes to triggering sound effects and social media commands, the possibilities are virtually limitless.The compact form factor of the Stream Deck Mini is a major advantage, as it easily fits into any workspace without occupying much real estate. Its portability makes it ideal for content creators who are always on the move or have limited desk space. Despite its smaller size, the keys remain responsive and provide satisfying tactile feedback, ensuring quick and precise actions with every press.The integration with popular software and streaming platforms is seamless, making the Stream Deck Mini an indispensable companion for streamers. Whether you're using OBS Studio, Streamlabs, or even Adobe applications like Photoshop and Premiere Pro, the Stream Deck Mini significantly streamlines your workflow and enhances productivity.In addition to its practicality for live streaming, the Stream Deck Mini is also an asset for video editing enthusiasts. Customizing keys with various editing commands and shortcuts expedites the editing process, saving valuable time and effort.One minor aspect to consider is the limitation of six keys, which may be insufficient for users with a wide array of commands and actions to manage. However, for those who don't require an extensive number of buttons or prefer a minimalistic setup, the Stream Deck Mini offers the perfect balance of functionality and simplicity.In conclusion, the Elgato Stream Deck Mini is a must-have tool for streamers, content creators, and video editors seeking to optimize their workflow and take their production quality to the next level. Its compact size, user-friendly software, and seamless integration with various applications make it a standout product in its category. If you're looking to enhance your content creation process and gain more control over your tasks, the Stream Deck Mini is an investment that will undoubtedly pay off.",

                "reviewText": "I did not buy this for streaming, and instead use this for working from home at my desk.Reasons why I enjoy it* Zoom - I was able to program shortcuts and just have a nice little gadget to mute, raise hand, camera on/off, and leave calls. I felt more engaged in the meeting vs using my mouse to move all over the screen and getting distracted by other things going on* Elgato Key Light - I received this as part of a work from home package and at first I wasn't sure if I cared but it ended up being a very useful and needed light source for my needs. Having a simple button at my fingertips made this a nice add.* Pomodoro Timer - I was able to use this to trigger multi-actions. So I had a pomodoro timer turn on and also a white noise track from spotify play at the same time. This allowed me to get my focus work done.* Calendar - I had set up separate buttons specifically to pull up my calendar on a specific area of my screen (used with moom) to have a good glance at my day. I use this feature often since my day is filled with zoom meetings.* World clock - I was able to display a world clock which is useful since I have teams across the world I work with* Spotify - nice to have controls at my finger tips.* App Launcher - it works just like cmd-tab, but I could toggle thru my apps by using a button.So... to be fair, none of this *required* a stream deck, but it definitely did make things a lot more simple, and I really liked this experience that I didn't realize I would benefit from, especially working from home.However, I have decided to return the mini. I was going to buy the 15key one because while the mini does allow for folders and menus, I find that I would be willing to pay a little extra to not have to dig thru menu items. However, before I buy the 15key, I am going to try the mobile app version on a stand first. One day with the mobile version definitely means it is not as tactile (the buttons on the stream deck feel great) but it does provide the same functionality as the 15key at a fraction of the cost.I think this is a great product for those working from home and taking video calls with teams often. This can be programmed to do a lot of things and I feel like I haven't scratched the surface. The mini definitely did everything I mentioned above, but I have the desk space and disposable income to maybe take it a step further. Highly recommend, but not needed. It's like wired vs wireless headphones. Wired was fine, wireless is better.",

                "reviewText": "Even though this unit has several options, I have found myself starting out with the most basic, the simple website button, and even though you could do that with a simple browser bookmark, it is very convenient to use the Stream Deck to access a website (link) anytime, from any place.For example, I have a cute button that allows me to access an emoji page so that I can add an emoji to a text, tweet (X post), or whatever with the click of Elgato Stream Deck button.The next set of buttons will be for the OBS, LiveStreaming, Twitch, etc., as I continue to use them in my professional studio.And, the mini allows me to travel with it, even with my laptop, programming the lower buttons to advance to the next screen with more programmable buttons, with a virtual unlimited allowable level of buttons! So, the sky is the limit.I export my settings to my second Stream Deck so that I always have the same setup wherever I go, whether, in my office or on-the-go, I am never without my push-button options with this little unit. I don't know how I lived without it (them)!",
