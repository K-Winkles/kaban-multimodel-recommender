                "reviewText": "Wasn't sure what to expect from this laptop stand, but it's pretty sturdy and a bit on the heavier side. It even comes with two tools (an allen wrench and another hex type) that can be used to tighten bolts. The tension out of the box is very tight. You need two hands to extend and compact it down. Use caution as it's easy to jam a finger.The only down side is that this stand is bulkier and heavier than other types of laptop stands. There are smaller X-type ones, but they are not as sturdy and the legs that prop up the stand fall out of the notch very easily. Due to it's bulk, you'll definitely need a backpack to tuck it away for traveling. It'll be difficult to fit this in a tote type of bag if you plan to travel light.If you don't mind the bulk or weight, this is a very sturdy stand and highly recommended. It extends up high enough (to stand and type at a desk), but be careful to center the angle and weight, otherwise once you start typing you can tip the stand.I plan to keep this stand as it provides good air flow and tension resistance. Due to it's bulkier build and weight, it won't travel with me as much unless I plan to be using laptop for hours on end as it'll require a backpack for travel.",

I don\u2019t have to worry about how hard it is to adjust because it stays on my desk.

I do not type directly on the laptop, I have an external keyboard/mouse.I have opened/closed the laptop 100 times or more since setting it up, and it only moved a couple times (when I pushed a bit harder than I should have).I have a 15 inch laptop on it now but had a much larger 19 inch before and never had any problems with the stand moving.",
