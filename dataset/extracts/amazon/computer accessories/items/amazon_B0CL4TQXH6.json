This doesn\u2019t really bother me since I have a case on my laptop and I will be putting the laptop sleeve in my purse or book bag. I also thought the material would be a smoother fabric instead of cotton. If you get the black one, it will attract lint because of this. The gold hardware on the small pouch is also tarnished, which is disappointing considering that the bag is suppose to be new. The smaller pouch is a very decent size and I love that it has an extra pocket to keep things organized. The lining of the smaller pouch and the outside pocket of the sleeve is made of a nylon material and not fleece. Overall, I still like the bag and I think it\u2019s cute and I\u2019m not mad at the price of it since I got it on sale.",
