They come packed in a little cardboard box. It is hard to pull out just one, and harder to put all the strays back in the little box. I might suggest a sturdier plastic container that held the straps stacked vertically.",

This can tear the stranded wire inside expensive patch cords. For the price range these are almost a steal. I certainly will be buying more. I am still building my modular synth instrument, but cable management becomes crazy. Using kitchen bag twist ties got old really quick. I will be using these a lot on my lab bench for sure..I think the only thing I don't like about these is they look like they will fray over time. I am not sure you can avoid that if your constantly changing your cables around. Even if you spend more on a reliable musicians brand. In my case I will be using these for prototyping as well. At this price point I can't complain and to be honest I think a dot of super glue here a little there when freying occurs will keep them from coming apart any time soon. Otherwise buy zip ties and make it permanent.",

I use them to bundle up power cords, organize my gig bag, keep my studio tidy, and because they're purple I can easily identify them as mine when my supplies get mixed up with other gear around a busy stage.I've purchased these twice and I will probably buy them again, not because the older ones are wearing out, but because they're the first thing I reach for any time I need to secure a cable.I will update this review if anything changes.",

                "reviewText": "I'm aware three stars on Amazon is a bad rating- it shouldn't be for cheaper items like this, but it be how it is. Consider these three stars as \"passable\".It's very clear why these cable ties are so cheap, and come in a fifty-piece pack. I think how plain they are is fine, and some would like a plainer cable tie (me included, as I value that). But the cable ties are pretty rigid and hard to tie around light amounts of cables, which is ironically what they're intended for. I suspect these are just straight Velcro straps bought off a line somewhere, and repackaged for sale as cable ties.As a result of them being rigid, it's hard to get a tight fit. So my recommendation- if you have a crazy amount of wires to tie up/organize, but don't need high quality ones, these are fine. Otherwise, just splurge or buy less of them, but good ones. I'm guessing most people reading this review won't need fifty, after all.",
