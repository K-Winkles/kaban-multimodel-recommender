                "reviewText": "I didn't expect to like this stand so much. These would make a great gift for family members. I purchased this for my desk but found myself carrying it to the kitchen or moving it to the coffee table. So, I ended up purchasing another one in purple so I could just leave it where I needed it. I love that they fold up so compactly and can be angled in multiple ways. When I first was reading reviews I didn't see anyone mention having a Google Pixel or how it worked for the pro-sized ones. I'm happy to report both my husband and my pixels fit. I have a Google Pixel Pro 6 and he has an 8. There was no falling over and I could angle it a few ways rather than just one height. Others complained they couldn't do this with their phone. So, I'm not sure why they had an issue. But, this is a great stand and surprisingly good quality. I'd purchase it again in more colors. My teen daughter has been hinting at my getting her one for her iPhone.",

                "reviewText": "First I want to say overall I am really pleased with the stand. This is a good product. It is well designed and sturdy.It\u2019s not going to fall apart on you. You can pose your phone in multiple positions and it will not shift once placed. My iPhone 13 fits well on it and a larger phone would have no issues.It has a built in silicone pad to prevent the phone from moving when placed. It also seems to help with heat.There are also silicone grips for feet so it doesn\u2019t slide on uneven or glass surfaces.They color matched the logo with the brass/gold in the green color which is a nice touch and an attention to detail often missed from others.Everything functions as designed and the seller was prompt in getting the item out and it was well packaged.I have one pro/con. It is a major one and that is the weight which affects its use as something travel friendly. It is quite heavy.I originally got this for dual purpose so I could use it around the house and when out and about as I\u2019m disabled and often drop things/ knock things over due to my neurological issues.Trial and error (and numerous broken phones and other broken accessories) has led me to figure out portable stands work best for me personally.That way if I\u2019m in the kitchen at a table, or at a restaurant, or at an doctors appointment I can just shove it on whatever flat surface is nearby and monkey around for a few, toss the stand in my walker basket when done and go; or have a phone stand for overnight charging when I go to bed or do virtual calls or general scrolling.This while a good stand is far too heavy for all of that.It has a weighted base to avoid tip over. They probably went a bit overboard on how much weight was necessary.While I can say it\u2019s not going anywhere when the phones on it I can also say it\u2019s not leaving the house. It\u2019s just too heavy to keep in my purse or shove in my carryon.I handed it to my Mom for her assessment and she agreed on the weight being too heavy for travel. She did also like the stand in general and it even held her massively oversized overstuffed wallet case iPhone 13 without tipping.I think they could adjust the weight in the base slightly to make it lighter while still holding the same function. Right now this is advertised as a travel friendly stand and I would have to disagree with that statement.It is however a wonderful stand for your home office or next to your nightstand.Will keep, but knocking one star off for it not actually living up to the multipurpose travel friendly design description.Still using for home and don\u2019t regret buying it.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using a lightweight faux-wood phone stand for a couple of years. It was ok, but it weighed less than the phone. It tilted a lot, and the phone ended up on my desk or the floor. This inexpensive device is far better. First and foremost, I can store my Samsung A11 phone at any angle and a range of heights. Thus, I can see the screen easily. Adjusting the height and the viewing angle is easy, and the phone stays just the way I set the stand. It's easy to attach the charging cable when the phone is on the stand, as well as being easy to put the phone on the stand with the cable already attached. This might sound trivial, but it matters and it works.For now, I'm using the shipping box as a travel case (4 in. x 2 7/8 in. x 1 1/8 in.); however, as sturdy as this stand is, I doubt the stand needs protection. Furthermore, when the case is fully folded, it stays folded, and there are no protruding edges to snag other items in my suitcase.I recommend this.device.",

It can also hold a variety of phone sizes, making it a versatile option for different devices.The build quality of this phone stand is top-notch. It is made of high-quality aluminum alloy and has a sturdy and stable base, which gives me confidence that my phone is safe and secure while on the stand.
