                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Webcam Cover (3 Pack) by Yilador, and I am delighted to say that this product has exceeded my expectations. This is actually my second purchase, as I wanted to ensure that both my laptop and iPad were equipped with reliable privacy protection.Privacy is a growing concern in our increasingly digital world, and Yilador's Webcam Cover Slide offers an excellent solution. The 0.03-inch ultra-thin design is sleek and unobtrusive, allowing me to easily slide the cover open or closed when needed. Its thinness ensures that it doesn't interfere with the laptop or iPad's closing mechanism, allowing for hassle-free use.The adhesive backing provided a secure and long-lasting attachment to my devices. Even after several months of use, the webcam covers have stayed in place without any signs of peeling or losing their grip. This reliability is crucial as it ensures that my privacy is protected at all times.One of the standout features of the Yilador Webcam Cover Slide is its versatility. The pack includes three covers, allowing me to protect multiple devices simultaneously. I appreciate the convenience of having spare covers for future use or for sharing with family members who also prioritize their privacy.The ease of use is another aspect worth mentioning. Sliding the cover open or closed requires minimal effort, and the smooth sliding mechanism ensures a seamless experience. It's a small action that gives me peace of mind, knowing that my camera is securely covered and my privacy is safeguarded.Furthermore, the Webcam Cover Slide does not leave any residue or marks on my devices when removed. This is especially important for laptop and iPad users who value the aesthetics and condition of their devices. I have had no issues with sticky residue or damage to the surfaces of my devices.In conclusion, the Yilador Webcam Cover (3 Pack) is an excellent investment for anyone concerned about their privacy. Its ultra-thin design, strong adhesive, and ease of use make it a reliable and convenient solution.

                "reviewText": "These camera covers were pretty decent for the price I had one placed on every device owned (this would include all the phones, tablets, computers etc).All the displayed amount comes in the set.They fit pretty well over the cameras for Android and Mac devices, and stay in place especially for the tablet and computers.The only issue I had was with the phone as the adhesiveness started to wear off with the constant putting in and taking the phone out of one's pocket. It fell off within the first 3 weeks.But for all the other devices it has stayed on there since the point of purchase up until now so I would definitely recommend this cover up for someone and they're very easy to slide across, it's pretty small, flat and the color makes it seamless when blending in on devices.*Saved us from countless Zoom and GoogleMeet Embarrassments. Attached some pics of what they look likeOh and they're not see through",
