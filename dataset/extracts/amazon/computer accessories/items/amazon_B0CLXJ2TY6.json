None of them have all of that flagship stylus's features, but at 1/5 of the cost (or less) that trade-off is just fine with me. (A stylus is something that I am going to eventually lose, so paying $100+ for one isn't an option for me.) This stylus is the first one, however, that I can say that I've gotten wet and it still worked. Not just wet, actually. It didn't just get rained on, I dropped it in the toilet, and it was completely submerged for a second or so before I fished it out. And this guy still worked! A prior one by a competing manufacturer had a similar incident in the bathtub and immediately stopped working. This company makes good styluses in my opinion. Regrettable company name, but Chinese firms aren't ever great at that kind of thing. Good product. Works well, and obviously very durable. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I thought my 2nd gen apple pencil broke so I wanted to find a cheap replacement for the few months of school I have left. Turns out it was not broken, but I haven't switched back to using it since I love this one.Pros:-Works just as well as my real apple pencil-Charges very quickly and seems to hold comparable charge to real pencil-Easy charging, my real apple pencil only charges on the side of my iPad but my case is so big it takes me like 10 tries to get it to charge magnetically-Love the light indicator to tell you in real time when it's time to charge (rather than the pen dying on me mid sentence)-Comes with replacement tips and a rubber grip, which costed me an extra $20 for my other pencilCons:-Occasionally glitches (writing not smooth if you write too fast, turns off while writing) twice in the 2 weeks I've had it (I'm writing for about 5-6 hrs per day)-Replacement tips don't fit the real apple pencil, seems to only fit this one pencilVery glad I bought it when it was sub$20 and would highly recommend to anyone!",

                "reviewText": "When. Ordered this I expected to be disappointed. Well it actually works very well and meets my needs. Nicely packaged with instructions, charging cable, extra tips and an email address for support (which I didn\u2019t need to use). It has LEDs to let you know the charging status and remaining power status. I have an iPad Pro 11\u201d 3rd gen. It\u2019s responsive, it has palm rejection, and the angle of the tip affects the width. It\u2019s holds to side of iPad magnetically. I am not an artist so this does when I wanted it to do. If you are an artist or want it to charge from the iPad directly or need the double tap feature then the Apple Pencil would be better - but it\u2019s 10x the Price. I hope this helps.",

I noticed that the pencil is dying a lot quicker (even though I am using it the same amount as before). It is also having problems charging. The green blinking light no longer shows up when it is plugged in. I wonder if there is a warranty for this product or I might just have to buy another pencil (but probably with a different company as a 6 month battery life is soo not worth it).",

Downside is that it needs to be charged in the wall or with a portable charging hub as opposed to charging an Apple stylus right on the iPad. From what she has said, it holds a charge far longer than my Apple Stylus. I think she would recommend it to others.",
