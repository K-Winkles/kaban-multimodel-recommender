I read many reviews of different pads and found this product to be the best quality for the best price. The pad feels very durable. It is cut material rather than stitched on the edges but it is obviously not going to fray. The pad doesn't slip with casual movement but it is easily moved. the pad provides about 6.5 inches on either side of my standard ten-key keyboard. The bad is soft also firm enough to be able to write on a sheet of paper on the pad without poking through. The few times I have spilled a few drops of a drink, the pad wiped up easily with nothing soaked in or stained. Great product with beautiful colors.",

It moves somewhat, but this problem is easily fixed with double sided tape which cannot be detected when installed. Works as designed. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I was in the market for a new mouse pad and after some research, decided on a a desk pad instead. In the end, I decided to choose this one because it matched my desktop. These desk pads are available in a variety of colors and sizes. It's sleek and my mouse works great on it. It is a little bigger than I had envisioned for my desk but that's on me and my lack of spacial awareness. The pad came rolled up so there were no creases in the mat. It did take a day of leaving heavy items on the corner to get the mat to lay flat. The only con is the thinness and lightness of the mat - it does slide around. Overall, I am happy with the purchase. I will be purchasing a smaller size in a different color for another desk.",

                "reviewText": "Love the texture and feel of this. Its not suede, but its not the hard plasticky feel of other faux leathers out there. Feels more like leather with a synthetic feel to it. My major concern was how the pad flattened once unrolled, but upon receiving the box, I immediately laid it out and let it rest on top of a table flattened by books before installing it on my desk. All corners and side lie perfectly flat and looks great on my desk. It's not the grippiest but its fine to me. It helps to clean the bottom of the pad and the desk with alcohol for better grip if that's what you like. Cleans up easy too.",

Otherwise, it was a great price for a great product, and I would most definitely buy it again.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f/5.",

                "reviewText": "Als ich meinen Heimarbeitsplatz neu gestaltet habe, stie\u00df ich auf die Knodel Schreibtischunterlage durch die Empfehlung meiner Partnerin. Die Beschreibung versprach viel, und ich muss sagen: Sie h\u00e4lt jedes ihrer Versprechen.Wasserdicht und Robustheit: Der erste Eindruck war die Qualit\u00e4t des Materials ein widerstandsf\u00e4higes PVC, das sich als absolut wasserdicht erwies. Dies ist besonders praktisch, da mein Arbeitsplatz oft von Kaffeetassen und Wassergl\u00e4sern bev\u00f6lkert ist. Ein umgesto\u00dfenes Glas? Kein Problem mehr.Design und Komfort: Optisch ist die Unterlage mit ihrer doppelseitigen Farbgebung in Dunkelgrau und Schwarz ein echter Hingucker. Sie passt sich nahtlosan jede Raumgestaltung an. Ihre d\u00fcnne Beschaffenheit macht sie zudem \u00e4u\u00dferst platzsparend. Beim Schreiben bietet sie einen angenehmen Untergrund, der sich auch bei l\u00e4ngerem Arbeiten als sehr komfortabel erweist.Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis: Hier punktet die Knodel Unterlage mit einem unschlagbaren Angebot. Selten findet man eine Schreibtischunterlage, die so viel Qualit\u00e4t zu einem so fairen Preis bietet.Ein kleiner Kritikpunkt: Einziger Nachteil ist ihre Tendenz, auf sehr glatter Oberfl\u00e4chen etwas zu rutschen. Hier w\u00e4re vielleicht eine rutschfeste Unterseite hilfreich. Doch dieses kleine Manko f\u00e4llt kaum ins Gewicht angesichts der vielen Vorteile.Fazit: Die Knodel Schreibtischunterlage ist ein hervorragendes Produkt f\u00fcr jeden, der seinen Arbeitsbereich funktional und stilvoll aufwerten m\u00f6chte. Ich kann sie uneingeschr\u00e4nkt empfehlen.",
