                "reviewText": "I purchased this item from Sunset Micro which from my experience is a solid company that does what they do very well. It is a very nicely refurbished HP home computer. It arrived on time and very well packaged with custom-cut foam surrounding the compact and sturdy pc tower. It came with a brand new free slimline keyboard and optical mouse. It also came with windows 10 preinstalled and it seems to be running seamlessly in all capacities. This is an amazing deal at $92. I opted for the 3-year warranty for $11. I doubled the RAM for $10. I installed an SSD hard drive and doubled the memory for $23 (and I will be using a flash drive I already own for an extra memory/speed boost). Everything was recognized and initialized really easily. I will probably add another fan ($4) and replace the thermal paste ($5) in the near future. So all in for $145 and I have a fantastic everyday functional worry-free computer for the next 3 years minimum. I say it's a win; a veritable paradise of technological delight.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't happy when I realized it had Windows 10 pro 64 bit on it. I wanted Windows 7 64 bit. That being said, I discovered I don't hate Windows 10 as much as I thought I would. Probably because of all the wars I had with Windows 7 over ownership. This seems to take me claiming ownership better. Plus I know my Android phone and Android tablet and how they work so Windows 10 makes sense to me but with more control than the Androids. And that has nothing to do with the computer itself just the OS [don't confuse the two].The computer runs like a champ. Extremely quiet. I had no problem opening her up, I wish all cases were that easy. Pull the lever and the top pops right off. The inside is cramped. But considering how little room she takes up, that's to be expected. Getting to the slot for my second hard drive was a breeze. It's right under the DVD. Simply press down on the foot and up it come when you pull. I put in a 1 Tb harddrive. She started up told me she found the drive, listed it, and asked if this set up was okay. I told it yes, it started up without a hitch. To get rid of the old Windows 7 files, I formatted. Delete won't work. She wants me to have ownership of them so I bypassed it and formatted since Windows 7 had crashed and had to be reinstalled wiping out my drive. [thank the computer gods for Crashplan]. More than enough slots. 4 on the front makes it really nice. It also has microphone and speakers/headphones standard plug ins in the front. My only complaint is the position that HP chose for the start button. They should have just put the HP symbol on it, instead it blends in perfectly with the cover and for my older eyes was a bit hard to see but once I learn the position, there will be no problem.The only faults is I can't put the second DVD/CD Read Write Drive in because of the space. The second hard drive was my choice. I will probably get a drive case for my others and convert the second DVD to external.",

                "reviewText": "If you want a temporary PC until affording something better then ones like these are perfect to do so. They seem to break down in mere months even when you check for ways to fix any software errors and the like. Its hardware is also brittle, crashing immediately if you make the mistake of slamming the mouse on the surface away from it for instance, making this scrapping noise on its front section where the power button and USB ports are located. It does not feature a built-in Wi-Fi conductor to use it as a connection, and it does come with an external unit to make use of such but on my case it just stops it completely and I have to rely on using a cable connected from my router to stay online.More problematics issues include that its shell is filled with scrapes and scratches, but since its a refurbished item I would expect such from the beginning. The USB ports often short out, not connecting directly with the mouse, keyboard, or even allowing to plug into your smartphone device until you just restart it in hopes that it does. It also crashes constantly after windows updates or simply for the heck of it at times over time. I had mine since October and am surprised it still runs even though I expect any day now it will just die and I will have to get something else. That something else will not be THIS PC however.",
