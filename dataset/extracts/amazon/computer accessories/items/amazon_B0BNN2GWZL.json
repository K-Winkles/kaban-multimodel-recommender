                "reviewText": "I had some neck pain from looking down at a computer so I thought for the price I would just try it out. It is great for a desk or work from home setting. It elevates the computer and makes my neck feel so much better. Such a simple yet effective product. Great price, very sturdy, and nice silver look. Non-slip too since it has great little rubber rectangles on the bottom to hold it in place.",

                "reviewText": "Can't find a better value laptop stand. It has a little flex if you press it down, but it's plenty sturdy and doesn't bend. You do have to screw the cross bar together, but it's quick and easy and the stand comes with a wrench to use.The only thing I wish it had was a slightly higher front lip to assure taller laptops won't slip off, but I haven't had any issues, so that's a really small concern. I'll be buying another one to use in the office.",
