                "reviewText": "Was very surprised to see how thick these are and they have some weight to them as well. Feels extremely durable overall and don\u2019t see these flexing overtime. The stand came completely scratch free with 0 defects noticed in the acrylic. Just as clear as the glass tabletop.On the sides overall height adds right about 4\u201d and in the middle it\u2019s 3-5/8\u201d. Inside diameter on the sides is approx 3-5/8\u201d and middle is just above 3-1/4\u201d.",
