                "reviewText": "There's a lot to like about this RGB deskmat...mainly that is has an RGB perimeter that can be adjusted with the button on the wireless charging pad. The pad could have bee integrated better, but I can understand that the mat probably isn't thick enough to hide into the mat material. it comes with a mouse wrist rest, USB A to C braided cable (seems to support QC 3.0) and a 30W PD charger that has both a USB A and a USB C (PD) port. The impressive part is that USB A port supports up to 27W (12V 1.35A) with the right device and cable. The PD port support up to 30W (20V 1.5A). But if you use both ports at the same time, you only get 5V 2A out of the A and C ports.The deskmat itself is on the thicker side (2.7mm), whereas most cheap mats are around 2mm. The wireless charging pad has a USB C power connector and claims up to 15W charging speed, but my Pixel 7 Pro could only get up to about 6~7W even with the case off. The power on/off button that looks like a finger print also turns RED when the wireless is not charging and turns BLUE when it is wireless charging.It's nice that you get a 30W PD charger in the package, but it doesn't include a PD cable...so you have to provide your own. And when you light up the deskmat, you still only get 10W (5V 2A) out of the PD port. I know wireless charging is finicky and you really have to line up the coils perfectly or you just generate heat and slow charging, but it's a nice all in one solution.",

The wireless charging pad works fantastic, and I'm able to charge my mouse, my headphones, or my phone on it without worry. The unsung hero is the wrist rest pad, though; it blends into the mouse pad behind it, but allows me to have an extra level of comfort I didn't realize I was missing. Overall, it feels high quality and is nice to work on.",

                "reviewText": "Worked great at first but then it started to randomly change lighting on it's own then that progressed to it turning off randomly. It got to the point where turning it back on wouldn't even work. It would just shut right back off. I was able to get it to light up again but it would take numerous times unplugging and plugging it back in before it would even stay on.After that, changing colors/patterns turned into a game of pure luck (if it would even stay on). The one color I want to use won't even show up now other than in a combination effect which throws off my whole setup. I wish it had no problems because the wireless charging on this works fantastic. It fast charges my Galaxy in under an hour. Who knows how long that will work properly though.I'll be ordering a similar product with higher reviews. The one time I don't check first...smh. Stay away from this one unless you want a black only pad with a good (although a gamble if you ask me) wireless charger.",

The pad doesn't provide much power but can keep your phone at a consistent level if not in use.The included wrist pad for the mouse is a great addition and I find myself using it all the time while working.The non slip backing makes sure it stays where you want it to and the surround light is bright and adds a little extra flair.The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the printed graphic is blurry. It's not terribly blurry but enough that I can't justify the 5th star. If that isn't a big deal to you I would definitely recommend this one!",

My roommate's iPhone charges just fine, but my old Android A51 or whatever doesn't charge. It recognizes something is there, but does not charge.Even with my personal phone not working with the charger, this thing is AWESOME. Work with the mat to flatten it out or roll it the opposite way. It will flatten out, just give it time. I never really used the wrist support, but I actually like this a lot. I have a large gaming mouse pad I use beside the desk mat and the cushion grips very well. It never moves.",
