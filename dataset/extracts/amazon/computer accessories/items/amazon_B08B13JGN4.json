My 16\" Macbook Pro fits and feels sturdy on it. And now my desk feels tidier and more spacious!Only minor complaints: the holes in the frame are too narrow for my HDMI cable head to fit through it (but a less bulky HDMI would fit through) and the grey grippy strips are a touch out of alignment/look imperfect without the laptop on it. That doesn't matter enough to me to affect my rating though.",

As someone who spends long hours working on a laptop, this stand has been a game-changer for me. Here's why I love it:Ergonomic Design: The adjustable height and angle options have made a significant difference in my comfort. No more hunching over my laptop, and it has significantly reduced strain on my neck and shoulders.Sturdy Build: The stand is incredibly well-built, and it holds my laptop securely. I was initially concerned about stability, but this stand feels rock-solid, even with my larger laptop.Portability: It's lightweight and easy to fold, making it perfect for both home and office use. I can even take it on the go when I need a portable workspace.Cable Management: The built-in cable management system is a thoughtful touch. It keeps my desk clutter-free and organized.Sleek Design: The minimalist design of the stand complements my workspace beautifully. It's not an eyesore like some other stands I've seen.Ventilation: The open design of the stand promotes better airflow around my laptop, which helps keep it cool during extended use.I can't express how much this laptop stand has improved my productivity and overall well-being. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of an ergonomic and versatile solution for their workspace. It's an investment in your comfort, health, and productivity. Worth every penny!",
