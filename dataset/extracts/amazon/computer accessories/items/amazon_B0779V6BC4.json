He has a Switch, and there's so many things that have to be plugged in to run and/or charge: the controller, headset, and Switch, plus he has his cell phone plugged in bc he uses the Bluetooth. He loves having the ability to plug everything in in one place, and just have one thing plugging into the receptacle, plus there is a headset stand, so that the headset isn't just laying down wherever, making it quickly accessible. Before this product he had thing plugged up everywhere in order to have enough receptacles for everything. If you are an organized person this is the perfect gaming product for you! No more cords all over the room! Love love love this!",

He\u2019s just been laying his headphones on the mixer and it has been bothering him. I thought this one was cool because it changed colors and lights up and so does his mixer so it matches perfectly. Also, you can charge things with it, which he thought was so useful!",

                "reviewText": "Got this for my dad, he loves it! There was a bit of a mixup on the initial order, they sent me the completely wrong item!! But I am glad I gave them a second chance and got this.The base is quite heavy so even if you accidentally nudge it, it is unlikely to tip over and spill your expensive headphones/headset on the ground.The charging is spot on, can charge two phones and a Bluetooth headset with ease, and quite quickly at that! It also has two outlets on the back for additional charging or if you just need an extra couple plugs for your PC. Very useful!As for looks, I do wish it came in more colors, and the stem and rest for the headphones themselves are thin and light. While this does make the center of gravity very low which makes it not topple over easy, if it DOES topple over, I fear they might snap. Also the top is molded plastic and you can still see some chunks of plastic from the molding process, which doesn't look as nice, can be trimmed with a razor but shouldn't have to take that step.The base's construction is very high quality, copper power connections, and there is an on/off switch so it isn't constantly drawing power.Overall I would give this product a solid B, mainly due to the excellent base design. Would definitely recommend it! Assuming they send the right product of course lol.",

If it\u2019s talking about the grip of the Anti-slip mat, then I would give it a 4.5. More weight on the base would probably help it more but it\u2019s not even a big dealThe stand itself is great. Its sleek and functional. No issues at all with the outlet. The USB ports were a bit difficult to plug into but they\u2019re all functional and they function WELL. Charges my devices fast.What I wish they would have included were optional mounting strips. I have a dog and I\u2019m very cautious about the possibility of her snagging on a cord and dragging the stand and everything else connected to it or hitting the desk and knocking things over. I used the Scotch\u00ae Clear Mounting Strips, 1 in x 3 in to mount it on the desk so it felt sturdier.I also wish the headset rest was just a little bit longer so you have the option to have 2 headsets on it (one on each side). I don\u2019t think it would hurt it aesthetically.Overall, its a great product for what its for and more. My husband liked it too so I might gift him his own to mount on his side table. Maybe it will help him organize his messy gaming area. So its a gift for me too lmao.",
