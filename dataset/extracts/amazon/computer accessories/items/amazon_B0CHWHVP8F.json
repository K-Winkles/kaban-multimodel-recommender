They are great save for one little issue. The edge of the desk is beveled outward and the devices don't fasten as tight to the edge as I would like. Asa a result they gradually work themselves loose and have to be re-positioned and tightened every now and then. No worry... the relief that these pads have effected is well worth the periodic effort of tightening them. 5 stars... Recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I will start with the good parts. The gel pad is really nice and soft, and has a good texture to it, and rebounds quickly. It is also thick, so my wrist doesn't \"bottom out\" on the base. The base and clamping frame are made from a thick gauge stainless steel with spot welds to hold the base and pad to the clamp.The pad is connected to the base by a hinge (also stainless) which I though was odd until I realized the reason. This requires some assembly, and you have to screw the clamp pad to the adjusting screw through a hole in the clamp top (see photo for what I mean.) So you need to rotate the pad out of the way for that one thing, and otherwise the hinge is pointless. It's stiff to move, but it won't stay at an angle once you place your hand/wrist on it, so it's not for adjustment.Partially why I don't like this is that it seems too tall. If there wasn't a hinge it would be a little lower, since you could do away with the height of the hinge itself and the top part of the clamp. It may still be too tall though. Perhaps if you have a tall mouse this would be OK, but for my slim mouse it's just too tall and my wrist is bent awkwardly down.The final thing that bothered me is that there is no padding at all on the clamp part. I'm not concerned about the clamp under the desk, but for the top of the desk I would want some kind of thin rubber pad to protect the finish. Of course that would make it even taller, lol. For testing, I put my mouse pad under the clamp, and perhaps that's a good solution for some people.I'll give 4 stars because it is well made, and might work well for some people, but I think it is a strange design choice to have that hinge there just for the one time purpose of assembly. Instead of the hinge, they should just ship it with a right angle screwdriver and do away with the hinge.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:1) ergonomic and comfortable. It really did relax my wrist. I didn't feel any wrist pain at all.2) Easy installation. Just place, tighten and - that's it!3) Easy to clean. I just vacuum it when I get dust or debris on it and it's good to go.4) Easy to relocate but would be annoying it you're relocating every 20 minutes.Cons:1) Although they do state it in the product description, I just wish they had a system that worked for beveled edges. I didn't count against the product rating because it fairly stated. However, it would be nice as a lot of desks nowadays have various types of edges.2) If you tighten too much, it will leave an indentation on the underside of the desk. It could do with a polymer to leave a mark instead of an indentation.Overall 4.5/5.0:It's a good product. If my desk wasn't beveled everywhere else, I probably would have gotten another one.",

                "reviewText": "I got this to use as an elbow rest while painting minis. same concept as a wrist wrest you would use at a keyboard but fixed position, raised and hopefully a little more resilient. In that regard its perfect. It attached easily to my desk, takes a fair amount of abuse while staying still, and provides support and comfort while i work. I do i wish the ring that holds it to the bottom was padded so it would be nicer to my desk, i found some small squishy thing that mostly does the trick but would have appreciated it included. I also find it tilts way to easily, i actually ended up sticking it just a little bit in the corner part of my desk so the other side of the L literally prevents it form being able to drop to the front. This was necessary as it kept slipping away and taking my elbow with it. All in all, as an elbow rest im happy with it. IF i were to be using this for my wrists for either my keyboard or mouse i feel like it would be a little too high and a little too firm. Perfect for my needs, may not be the same for yours.",
