                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars If Size and Functionality is your goal, buy this Mini BT Keyboard!",
                "reviewText": "So overall I have a bad habit of buying multiple items of the same category, due to me being conflicted about said items different features. Pertaining to the \u201cFOSMON Mini BT Keyboard\u201d, I believe that I have finally discovered the \u201cperfect\u201d Mini BT Keyboard (at least for me). Unlike some of the others I have purchased, this one feels the most \u201cbalanced\u201d as well as offers the best QWERTY and multimedia key layout.One major problem that was common on the multiple other Mini BT Keyboards I have purchased was the Touchpad. It honestly felt like all the others simply added the Touchpad in order to compete with the other brands, but its functionality was to just visually look like their competition. Well this is not the case with the \u201cFOSMON Mini BT Keyboard\u201d. To my complete surprise the touchpad not only works fantastically, the Left & Right click button layout was actually thought out and designed with \u201cUser Comfort\u201d at the forefront.Pairing this mini keyboard with any BT device is a breeze, and it instantly connects everytime it is switched on. I personally use mine for connecting to my iPad Pro 12.9\u201d, TCL 55\u201d OLED 4K TV, and my Steam Deck. In my gaming room my recliner is roughly 5-6 feet from my TCL TV, and connection range is not an issue whatsoever. I actually stood against the back wall in my game room which is roughly 15 feet from the TV, and once again the range was not an issue at all. Overall the snappy connection, the perfectly thought out key layout, and the touchpad functionality alone was enough for this Mini BT Keyboard to surpass all the others easily, but some other functions place cherries on the top. To give you an example of how compact this keyboard actually is I\u2019ve attached a photo with it side by side with my Apple Pencil Gen 2, and they are both nearly the exact same thickness which is super thin, but not TOO thin.I have been using this keyboard for 2-3 hours daily for nearly a week, and the battery is still not dead yet! All of all the other models I have purchased seemed to die after 4-5 hours of use, so this keyboard surpasses the others by an extreme longshot. Overall I absolutely love this Mini BT Keyboard, and have another one in my Amazon cart just so I have a backup in the event Amazon quits selling them for some strange reason. You will not be disappointed with this purchase, so click \u201cAdd to Cart / Buy Now\u201d and rest easy knowing your money has been well spent!- Pros: \u2022 The Mini-ness is IMO the perfect size Mini. Any larger or Smaller would detract from its great balance. \u2022 The keys are very solid and have a nice \u201cclick\u201d to them. You can physically feel each click perfectly. \u2022 Battery life is supurb, and leagues above any other Mini BT Keyboard I have purchased (10+) \u2022 I am a function over form guy without a doubt, but if it matters to you, this keyboard looks sharp! \u2022 The touchpad is the closest to feeling like a full size touchpad I\u2019ve discovered, and it isn\u2019t even close. \u2022 Tons of \u201cMultimedia\u201d keys that expand the functionality with multiple devices exponentially. \u2022 Solid build that doesnt feel cheaply made. At this price point it is incredible that it feels this nice.- Cons: \u2022 All in all I truly can not list any \u201cGlaring\u201d cons, but I will list some things that could be a little better. \u2022 Not having backlit keys doesn\u2019t detract from how much I love this keyboard, but they would be nice. \u2022 A little bit larger touchpad would be nice but would affect the perfect size IMO, so no issue honestly. \u2022 Using a Micro-USB to charge is very outdated, and charging using a USB-C would of been nice to have. \u2022 Honestly nothing else to list. I love it, and I think you will as well.",

                "reviewText": "I like how this keyboard is small, but actually very easy and natural to use. It's about the size of a larger smart phone, but extremely light weight. I use it with my PC which has a TV as one monitor. I can sit across the room and control it like a regular keyboard would. It does not come with a Bluetooth chip dongle, so you will have to have a Bluetooth receiver in your PC already if you use it in this way. The track pad works surprisingly well. It charges with a USB c plug. There is a switch to turn off power so you can save it's battery while not in use. It has volume controls and pause/play buttons, but also, most movies will pause by hitting the space bar, but now I can do that from the couch cause it's a mini keyboard! It has a button to toggle it's key lights, so you can use it in the dark. Super happy with this freakin thing!",

                "reviewText": "I fixed up my old pc to be a media center in the family room and this works perfectly for navigating the menu and browsing the internet. the battery holds very well and has a sleep mode that it goes into after about a minute of inactivity and wakes up about a second after pressing a key or jostling the track pad. the track pad is fairly precise for the size and requires a more gentle touch to work proper so don't press down when using, just glide your finger on it. the back lighting is sufficient for when the lights are off and its easy to turn off to conserve energy. I've had zero problem with connectivity since I paired it which was a breeze. the quality is there which is why I went for this one rather than the cheaper ones which all seem to have some kind of issues either with battery life, connectivity or something else. I wouldn't say this should be used for gaming because its far too small for conventional pc gaming but it fits fine in my hands and is ergonomic, perfectly fit to be a remote controller while away from a desk.",

                "reviewText": "Okay first the good. The trackpad is on the right which is great for right had folks and that is where I like it as well. The Left/Right click button are on the shoulders where one would expect to find them allowing your right thumb to remain constantly on the track pad while you use your left hand to click.Now the bad. Trackpad is a little too small and inaccurate. Bluetooth connectivity is spotty, I have a lot of wireless devices so it does have interference, but I have other Bluetooth devices that do not balk so this one is not as good as it could be. Even though the left/right mouse click buttons are on the shoulders they are not comfortable and should be closer to center instead of on the edge shoulders. I would prefer the device to also be bigger as well so it's too small for my tastes. Your mileage may vary. But this is definitely not for people that need/like bigger buttons.The keyboard is okay... seems low quality but it does have a backlight and is easy to see during day or night. The LED indicators are too bright... especially the blue ones... these indicators may well be bright and focused enough to cause actual eye damage if stared at too long or over time but someone with a tool to analyze light wave frequency needs to confirm. stupid bright led lights really need to be addressed... it is bright enough to light up the ceiling in blue when the lights are out.Over all 3 out of 5 it gets the job done but not very well.",

                "reviewText": "I got this because after like 10 years of smartphone touch keyboards i'm still making tons of typos and sometimes I want to write something lengthy and use an actual tactile keyboard. I also wanted one that could fit in my pocket, the Logitec ones are great but not as portable. This one seemed like exactly the thing i wanted but unfortunately the touchpad makes it kind of akward and hard to reach the keys for the right hand, and not very good for longer writing sessions. Also I found the buttons are not pronounced enough to sort of navigate via sliding your fingers over them, I find myself looking down a lot while typing. But, i'm sure if I used it more it would become less of a problem.Works well. Turn the back lights on and off. You can use a mouse pointer on smart phone, that's kind of cool for some stuff. Copy and pasting much easier. All the good stuff you get from a bluetooth keyboard just more portable.There aren't very many choices in these things, which is too bad. I would have chosen one without a touch pad but I wouldn't find any that didn't look kinda cheap.",
