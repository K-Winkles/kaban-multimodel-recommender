                "reviewText": "I have only had this organizer for a couple of days now, but everything that I could possibly need on a daily basis I've moved into this. Overall I think it has an okay build quality, the only thing I don't completely like about it is that the mesh pouches inside have elastic on them that looks like they'd definitely stretch out over time. They have their use cases, however if I wanted to put AirPods or something of similar size into them, they bulge pretty bad and I can see how it can cause problems over time with the durability. It's not super big, so if you're looking for something that's going to be able to hold EVERYTHING (power banks, cables, earbuds, etc.) it's probably not going to work for you. However, with the size it is it ends up being a super convenient package and does what I need it to do perfectly!",

As someone who constantly juggles multiple gadgets and accessories, finding an efficient and stylish way to keep everything organized has been a game-changer.I used to put my cords in a small bag and they would get tangled. The design of this bag is sleek and modern, making it a fashionable accessory for both casual and professional settings. Another standout feature is the inclusion of cable organizers and Velcro straps, which eliminate the annoying tangle of cords that usually accompany electronic accessories.If you're looking for a stylish and practical solution to keep your electronics in order, I highly recommend giving this organizer bag a try. It's a worthy investment for anyone who values both style and functionality in their accessories.",

This case caught my eye because it seemed to have a lot of versatility. It is attractive and well-made. If I were to have any complaint it is that there are too many small pockets for cords and not enough larger pockets (only one) for a portable recharger and/or wall charger. It is a decent size - overall - however - and I have it crammed full. It is a bit heavy for my purse - but then again - I have everything I need in a well-organized case.",

                "reviewText": "Travel a lot and have multiple gadgets and electronic accessories that require charging cables and such. Got this because the old ziploc bag thing was not working as well as needed. Cables would somehow always find a way to get tangled together no matter how neatly rolled not to mention the bags wore out too quickly. This electronic accessories bag works perfect and is just the right size for all cables needed to neatly fit in the provided pouches. Expected the zippers to be a little heavier maybe metal instead of polyester but so far so good. The fabric is a midweight and seems durable enough but a little concerned about the mesh / netting pouches over time. Overall a good product for the price and would definitely buy again and even recommend to others.",

That is what I think I dislike about it. The compartments are smaller and when its full its very odd shaped and hard to zipper. I wouldn't buy again but I don't intend to return. I'll probably give it to one of my kids and get a hard case next time.",

                "reviewText": "CAOODKDK Electronics Accessories Organizer Pouch is alright for what it is. Could it be better? Yes, but only a little better. It's actually a pretty good little casde.I bought the two sided case in black for a couple reasons. One being that I was going to need both sides. The other being that all but one of the other colours were more expensive. Some were close to $10 more.On the up side, it's a neat little case with enough pockets on one side to store and organize most of the little cables you might need. There is also a long slim pocket that could hold a mobile phone or battery pack. Charge cables, head phones, and so on, will fit quite nicely into the pockets provided they are not too long. The flip side of the case has two larger pockets that will easily store a battery pack and an external hard drive.It's roughly the size of a pencil case and even fully load is not that heavy. The zippers on both pockets both work well. No snags or jams to speak of. The water resistant claim seems to hold up, but I don't think I'm going to test that repeatedly. All in all, it's good enough to be home base for most of the little things you might otherwise end up digging through your suitcase/carry-on for.I have packed 4 cables, a set of ear buds, 2 battery packs, a pouch of USB-C converters and a portable LED lamp with all of it's attachments. The case was pretty much at capacity after that.Now the negatives... My iPhone charger will not fit in the case, nor will one of the other (longer) charge cables I need to have with me. Also, one really has to watch how they pack the case, as it is soft shell all the way around. What you pack on one side impacts how much you can fit in the other. I'm impressed with how much the case will hold, but not being deep enough to hold the charger is a bit of a negative, as it is most likely to be the item I misplace or leave behind. It just looked a little bigger in the pictures I guess.",
