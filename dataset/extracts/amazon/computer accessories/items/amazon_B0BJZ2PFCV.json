Both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have reported that there is no need to compulsively clean your phone, but mechanical keyboard cleaning kit is still a good idea to give it a quick wipe down every now and then. HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU CLEAN A KEYBOARD? As a general rule, we'd say to give your keyboard a quick dust and wipe at least once a week just to keep on top of things. For a deeper clean, once a month sounds right - this would involve taking the keycaps off and cleaning those separately, as well as going in between the switches themselves to dust. HOW OFTEN SHOULD I CLEAN MY LAPTOP? Given the number of places they go and how often they\u2019re touched, it\u2019s no surprise that laptops get quite dirty, but you might be surprised at just how dirty they get. Studies have found that desktops and keyboards are among the dirtiest surfaces we touch every day. With that in mind, the more often you clean the better. We recommend you wipe down your desk and keyboard at least once a week.",

The metal pen tip gets that lint out of the speaker holes on the iPhone. It is easy to store and travel with the way it is all put together.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, the color is completely wrong. I ordered the teal-ish one, which is marked as \"Tiffany blue\" and looks correct in the pictures. Tiffany blue is an actual color, with hex code #81D8D0. Well, the item I received is in not even close to Tiffany blue or teal. It is light blue. I do not think I received the wrong color because from the pictures, the blue one is much darker, but then again, the color in the picture may be very wrong. Plus, other reviewers have complained of the same thing, which I unfortunately did not see before I ordered it. I did add a picture of the item plus a reference for the color it is supposed to be. This just annoys me greatly.Second, the plastic covering for the lens wipe on the back of the device is extremely difficult to take off. I broke a fingernail trying and had to use a credit card to pop it off. It is still this hard to remove even after taking it on and off a few times.Aside from the above issues, I will say the kit is handy. It is compact and portable, and the parts of it I have been able to use have worked reasonably well. Plus, it did come with several replacements for various parts of it. It also seems decent quality.EDIT: I have adjusted my rating because the seller reached out to me and saying that they have discovered the problem with the color was a product mislabeling issue at the factory and that they are working to rectify it. The kit is at the end of the day good quality, useful, and compact, other than the fact that the back panel is still difficult to take off. I left my initial review intact above. Hopefully future buyers will get the right color!",
