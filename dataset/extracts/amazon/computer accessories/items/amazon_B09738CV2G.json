Navigating through various tasks has become notably smoother, with dedicated pages for specific applications like Spotify and OBS, totaling over 8 pages (you can have more if you want). The device has undeniably streamlined my access to essential functions. Additional pros include its user-friendly interface, customizable options, and the potential for increased productivity across various applications. I love the plug-ins, there is so much variety and you can even use Stream Deck to turn on/off your lights in your room (I use Govee LED and it\u2019s connected to a Amazon power source that is directed by Stream Deck to turn off from just the click of a button). Overall, this deserves more than 5 stars, even if you aren\u2019t a gamer or streamer, you can use it for apps such as IntelliJ, and access your programming apps faster (I also use it for this).",

Right from the moment you hold it, the build quality exudes excellence, and the screens in each button offer outstanding clarity.What truly sets this product apart is the accompanying app. It's a game-changer, providing seemingly endless possibilities for customization. Whether you're programming a soundboard, managing smart switches for lights and speakers, or initiating apps, the Stream Deck handles it all with ease.While I find it relatively simple to use, it's undoubtedly a power user product. It might not be as useful for casual users due to the learning curve in setting it up and maximizing its potential. However, for those willing to invest the time, it's a tool that opens up a world of creativity and efficiency.Its build quality, clarity, and the versatility of the app make it a must-have for streamers, content creators, and anyone seeking a highly customizable control hub for their digital activities.",

                "reviewText": "Those guys deserve a review...The product is well priced, versatile, and easy to use.While the product caters mostly to gamers and streamers, I discovered that it could fulfill a need in the more boring productivity needs.I work with 3 screens and need to quickly be able to do things like stopping music, muting teams, accessing a work application (outlook, apple mail...)Specifically, the teams integration is easy. I have now button short cuts for Teams action which is great when I'm doing something else at the same time.The possibility are infinite. I think an average user can setup the prodcut pretty fast for basic actions.The software is solid and intuitive .Good job to the Elgato team. You created a blockbuster.",

                "reviewText": "i love tech and using and trying new things, however, I am often limited to what I can do since I use Mac, this however works with Mac and is so cool. I was going to get the 6 button one but they're on back order, so happy that they are because this one is so much more useful. If you are on the fence about getting it just do it its so worth it. Build quality is outstanding and the app that you use to set it up is super user friendly.",

Its intuitive software allows for easy assignment of actions and macros to the programmable buttons, streamlining tasks with a single touch. The dynamic LCD keys with customizable icons provide visual feedback, enhancing engagement without constant screen glancing. With seamless integration into popular platforms and support for plugins, the Elgato Stream Deck is a versatile tool that justifies its higher price tag for those serious about content creation and streaming. By the way, I only use it for gaming with my friends and capturing clips for games to enjoy memories, so it's worth $150. The day I ordered it was on 12/11/2023.",

The supporting software could benefit from a more Mac-centric design but it\u2019s functional. I\u2019d recommend it for any person who wants to automate their workspace with a programmable keypad. I know there\u2019s an iOS app that allows for 6-buttons, but having a dedicated physical device is most ideal.,",
