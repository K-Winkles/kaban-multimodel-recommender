            "[Comfortable Experience] Steplively foot rest has two layers: the lower layer is 2.0\" thick, and the upper layer is 3.7\" thick. The ergonomic design of the foot rest gives you freedom to choose the proper height according to your needs and to better relieve the pressure on your limbs for long periods of sitting.",
            "[Adjustable Height] StepLively foot rest has two-piece removable footrest with magic tapes between the upper and lower layers so that you can adjust the height of the foot rest according to your usage needs. When you want to add the height of the foot stool, you only need to pull the zipper and magic tapes between the two layers of the foot rest to switch the thickness for a higher height. Want it lower? Simply remove the bottom flat piece.",
            "[High Quality] The core of StepLively foot pillow is made of high-quality foam, which is supportive and does not easily collapse or lose shape. The bottom of the foot pillow is made with a non-slip design, which ensures that the foot pillow does not easily shift when being used. The cover of the foot pillow is made of machine washable velvet fabric, which is attractive and comfortable.",
            "[Easy to Clean] The cover of the StepLively foot rest is installed with a zipper so that it can be easily removed for machine washing. When the cover of foot rest is dirty, simply wash in the washing machine. The foot rest\u2018s fabric is durable that ensures the foot rest cannot be destroyed even after many uses and washes.",
            "[Multi-Use] StepLively foot rest not only can be used as the traditional footrest under desk, but also may be used under the knee on a bed or sofa to provide extra support for lower back pain while lying down or sleeping. Flip it over and it turns into a rocking pedal to help you relax and relieve stress or boredom. The bottom of the foot rest has an anti-slip design, so you don't have to worry about the foot rest shifting when using it."

                "reviewText": "My son has such long legs lol. we had a hard plastic foot stool but it just wasn't cutting it. I ordered this for him and he raves about it. whether he is stretching out and its his legs or ankles or he is gaming and using it for his feet, its soft but sturdy and so worth it. The hard plastic ones we all used for years, this one I think is us evolving in that fact . Take care of your body, it doesn't cost a lot so easy to check out if right for you.",
