                "reviewText": "Using this product to handle SD cards management and for charging multiple devices via its power delivery USB-C port. I purchased an Anker 100W charger with USB-C connector to plug into this Acodot AIO hub. I've had five USB devices hooked up for charging simultaneously and all charged up faster than each with their respective chargers! Speaking of chargers, this little hub alleviates the need to have to all of them plugged into various wall outlets or slots on a surge protector. One and done. It has x3 3.0 USB ports and x2 2.0 ports for legacy devices. When powered through charger, devices charge if there's a battery and data passes with flash drives for example with no problems. It can hybrid between them, which is especially handy if you're working with data and charging devices at the same time. Built in card reader is nice too! Great data speeds (read/write) too. Wish it had a RJ-45 Ethernet port, but this is a budget hub and it goes with the territory in its being missing. Overall, this is a quality device and I'd certainly tell anyone sitting on the fence about buying one to go ahead and buy it. Did a lot of poring over specs and what-not and this one met my criteria: (1) Windows and Linux/Android compatible; (2) USB-C connection; (3) Capable of powered charging from 100W charger; (4) SD card reader functionality. The fact it has HDMI is a bonus. I'm not much of a traveller, but I would imagine (if I were) that having the option to setup a second monitor on my mobile device capable of it (tv in hotel room, for example) via HDMI would be quite nice to have as an option. Theoretically, one could probably use one of these with a HTPC or mini-pc setup with a HDMI to whatever-audio-source converter box to handle surround sound, plus you'd have storage options via flash drives for your media. Could have a load of batocera linux on a bootable flash drive for some retro gaming with a wireless controller... oh the possibilities!",
