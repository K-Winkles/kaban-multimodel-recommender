It's small enough it will fit into her carry bag for work.The material seems sturdy and seems like it will hold up for a long while. Along with the zipper, smooth with no snagging. The storage area has small compartments that can be arranged to your liking or needs.I would recommend this product.",

I like it so much that I bought two more for our kids to use when we traveled abroad. The case holds a lot \u2014 the video I attached shows everything I put in it, and there is still room for more. The case is also a little stretchy and the zipper has a little give so you can fit items that are slightly too large (like my circular charger).It comes with spacers you can move and attach using Velcro. I took most of them out because it\u2019s not a necessary feature for me, but I do appreciate the flexibility to not have to keep them in there.I also like that it has a handle for easy carrying. The fabric is also really durable.",
