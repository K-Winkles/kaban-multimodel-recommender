I was concerned because one review low key complained about it having no shoulder strap nor a way to add one like no decorative bag loops...but everything else seemed to line up with that I needed in a bag, so I decided to take the chance. I'm glad I did! I do see how this bag might not be suitable for a student who might have to walk far distances, or for someone who walks a bit to work...but for my purposes, I would only ever bring it in and out of the library or coffee shop, so holding the handles doesn't even phase me. My purse is the same way anyway, so I just hold both in one hand sometimes and walk down the street lol. But I guess do consider whether or not you might want a strap if you have far daily walks. It might have been annoying for me, too.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to use for school. I ended up only using the main pocket, which I kind of just stuffed everything into, but I did like it. Earlier, I used a different case, but the handle ended up breaking. So far, this hasn't broken, but I've used it for less than one school year. It seems more durable than the other one, which was a Five Star, but I'm not sure yet. This worked really well for carrying my school supplies, much better than using a bag or just carrying everything would have been. Again, I'm not sure of the durability yet, but it seems pretty good. Would recommend.",
