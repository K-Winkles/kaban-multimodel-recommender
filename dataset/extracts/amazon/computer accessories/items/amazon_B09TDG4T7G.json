Don\u2019t make my mistake though!! The first time I stuck it on the wall I realized after I had already secured it that I didn\u2019t like the placement. The adhesive is extremely effective so it was hard to take it off again, and I was sure it would rip off the paint. I finally got it off though and you would never know it had been there! No paint ripped off and there was no adhesive left behind. Plus, when I stuck it again it didn\u2019t need anything extra to stick on, and it\u2019s been about a month now with no problems! A1 product that I definitely recommend.",
