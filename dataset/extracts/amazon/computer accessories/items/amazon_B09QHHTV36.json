                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these. One in black for teens room and one in white for the front room. The one in the front room is absolutely perfect, does NOT get hot or seem overloaded. They usb and C ports charge VERY VERY well. The one in the other room is the same, no over heating or other issues, we just needed MORE usb ports on that one, but that's a personal issue, as I knew how many ports it had when I ordered it. I will be buying at least one more for my Christmas decorations. I bought them to replace 2 of another brand that were burned up when a tree fell on our power lines and sent a huge surge. So I do not yet know how well they will hold under those circstancestances but I hope to never need ro find out! But with the normal fuse box surge turning power off and back on and one big electrical storm with serious lightening activity and power flashes , they haven't had a problem! I highly recommend these!",

                "reviewText": "I love this thing, it's not only adorable, but it makes for keeping my power strip easily accessible for easy dusting. I keep it on my desk, whereas my old power strip stayed on the floor and I can't bend over too well due to back issues.I love that it has USB charging ports as well, my phone charges pretty fast using it. It's also a cleaner look than the long strips, as well as taking up much less space.Another thing that I love, is that the plug is flush flat to the wall rather than sticking outward. The outlet I need to put it in is up against the head of my bed, so I was always so worried about my old power strip being dislodged from the outlet. Now I don't have that worry.The plug is also at an angle, so if you put it in the top most plug in an outlet, you can still use the bottom plug for other things.A good find, I'll be buying a few more.",

                "reviewText": "I was thinking this would be great for the corner of my bathroom where I have a heated towel rack on a timer and an electric toilet seat with bidet like features and I have a dehumidifier and I wanted to put in an Alexa device like the Echo Pop. All too much for the one outlet I have there so I thought this unit would be great and not take up much room. The problem was the way the cords plug in to this little bar. It honestly didn't take up less room than a small straight bar because the cords stick out when they are plugged in. That coupled with the timer, it was hard to stop this unit from having the floating effect because of the way the cords were plugged into it. So thinking I would save space didn't pan out the way I had hoped, but at least I was able to plug everything in with spares left over and everything works when they are all on together at the same time. So no tripping the bar which is a good thing. But I do like that I can now plug all my plugs into the device and still have room for more. Doubt I would need anything more in this spot but in case I do I have the room. I just have it sit in behind the machine and were good to go. I have yet to try charging my phone with this power bar yet because I don't sit there long enough. LoL For that reason I am in.This is an update which kind of affects my situation. Took away a star because there was no warning in the description about not using this in the bathroom which is where I use mine. So I am going to leave it in the bathroom and hope that the circuit breaker is working in case of a short due to moisture. It is unlikely because I use an exhaust fan and a dehumidifier in that bathroom, so moisture build up is unlikely and it is not near the tub or sink. But had it said specifically in the description not to use in the bathroom, I would probably looked for something else. And my outlet is ground faulted so I should have nothing to worry about.",
