However, if you need a set of ear buds that allow you to hear what\u2019s going on around you and you don\u2019t mind the tinny sound they will work. I paid $14 after coupons and discount codes for these and that\u2019s about all that they are worth. They are not bone conducting. My AirPods are definitely better by 1,000,000% but I don\u2019t have to worry about losing one at the gym with these. The case is very cheap feeling. I\u2019m sure it will break soon. Definitely do not pay more than $15 for these.",
