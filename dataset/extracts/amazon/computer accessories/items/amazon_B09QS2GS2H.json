Love the soft material used on the top of the mouse & left/right-click buttons. My favorite feature is how QUIET these primary buttons are -- quietest mouse ever! (To be fair, though, the forward, back, and dpi buttons are rather clicky.) I'm not using this for gaming, so it features ample buttons for browsing the web and everyday operations. Have not had a single problem with connectivity or waking up from sleep. My only insignificant, minor gripe is the plastic used on the sides of the mouse feels a little cheap, it takes away from otherwise 'premium' feeling mouse...but in the big picture, I don't care! Worth every penny.",

                "reviewText": "Mouse is a bit larger than the average size and fits my hand nicely while feeling quite sturdy as I like a heavier mouse. Has 2 modes, one where the RGB lights stay on and one where the mouse is unlit. You can change dpi settings as well, though there really isn't any way to tell what the number is, you just have to kind of play with it until it feels comfortable for you.Biggest issue is battery life. I've gone through 3 AA batteries in 4 months on this mouse, which is crazy considering my wireless logitech gaming mouse probably uses 1 battery in a year. If you run it with the RGB lights on the battery will drain incredibly fast. With normal unlit use you will probably get about a month or so out of a single battery if you are lucky.",
