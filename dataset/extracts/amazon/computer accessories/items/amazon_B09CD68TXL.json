                "reviewText": "I Owen a dog grooming salon from out of my own home in our garage area and I have many many many, a lot of things such as a blow drier that runs a very high amount of energy when turned on and tends to always blow out true breaker whenever I try and use it on my pups, and a nail Dremel, hair cutting clippers, fans around the salon for both drying the pups after bathing them and to help keep both myself and my pups being groomed there cooler during the summer seasons of the year, different thing on my professional Dog Grooming Bath tub, and much much more as well, and having to go all theu my salon to unplug and plug in things all day long, and having to try to figure out what cord goes to what utility item to unplug and plug in for servicing a dog is very very difficult as well as time consuming and irritating on top of everything else as well! All of that i mentioned above also very much causes breakers to be blown and having to constantly be reset all day long too as well. So once I purchased and received this very handy item, and began using it apon arrival immediately, every item I needed and had to use throughout the working day was all plugged into one place and the item has a VERY convenient breaker switch right on the utility tower itself, so instead of blowing your house breaker and possibly causing major issues in your home, it breaks the utility plug tower itself that can easily be reset on the tower itself and you\u2019ll quickly be able to continue your work day making it so much easier, less irritating and less working to fix it all, and allows you to amothly continue on with your stress free day. And the very best part bout this tower plug in for me is the fact all you have to do to use your equipment that\u2019s plugged into it is simply and very quickly turn it all on, everything in my salon to be exact, with just a extremely fast press of a button on the very top of the utility tower itself and there\u2019s actually two separate buttons on top of the plug in tower to turn on and off! So depending on Whit h side you choose to plug your things into, this way you can choose what gets turned on and off with each button and then all you have to do is press that button and it\u2019ll turn off just those things you have chooses and the other things will stay on u till you choose to then them all of by pressing down on the other button and then turning those items all off too as well like you had done to the other stuff by the other button earlier. Hope this makes. It also has a place for 4 in total plug in USB cords for charging items such as phones, tablets, vapes, computers, merchant credit/ debit card machines, ECT. It\u2019s save me so much headaches and irritation, time, understanding,!so much everything! And on my electricity bill too as well!",
