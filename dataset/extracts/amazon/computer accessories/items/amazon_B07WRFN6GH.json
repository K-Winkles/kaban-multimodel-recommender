Looks good, works great. Proud to own it. One thing to keep in mind, the USB ports are USB2, not USB3, but both ports support data (ie, mouse/keypad and small data transfers) and the charge rate is fairly slow, but it works like a charm and if I'm at my desk anyway I don't need a super fast charger. More than enough for the headphones and my cell phone. Very happy.",

The stand has 5 options of lighting ranging from individual breathing lights to RGB flow. Not only do the lights stand out and all look fantastic, but it is built to last. It is very sturdy and put together in a solid fashion. It does not require any assembly, just pull it out of the box, plug it in, and go. The AUX input and USB ports all worked fine and are functional if you want to use them. Just note that for the usb and AUX ports to work, the headset must be plugged in with the USB that provides power and audio capabilities, but that is explained well in the instructions. The only downside for me is that the lights will stay on even when the computer is put to sleep or turned completely off, but the easy work around is to use the light switch on the stand to turn the lights off when you are done playing if you do not want the lights on all the time. All in all, this is a solid, well-made, affordable gaming headset stand for any gaming rig.",

My favorite feature about this is the build in 3.5mm AUX port and USB passthrough. I can plug my headset directly into the headset stand and the computer recognizes the mic/speakers. The 2 USB ports on the stand are also very convenient for USB flash drives or other peripherals you need to plug in/unplug on a regular basis. I just downloaded and set up the 7.1 surround sound software and it sounds great. Also the RGB effect is kind of cool and doesn't seem way over the top like some effects I have seen. Solid product and I would recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Looks great, doesn't feel super cheap, functional USB passthrough.While I did run into an issue not long after plugging in this device, I am not convinced the issue was caused by this headphone stand. Roughly an hour after plugging this in, I had some trouble opened new tabs in web browsers and decided to reboot. On reboot I got a blue screen advising that windows drivers were missing and my system would not boot into windows. A simple repair with the install media fixed it. Deep virus can ran, and nothing showed up. So far no other issues. Just.. weird that this happened after connecting this device.",

                "reviewText": "So you would think from the looks it looks cheaply built. That is the opposite it holds my headphones perfectly. It is super sturdy. The plastic is very nice and the lights are awesome. Instead of razers holder for like 100$ i would get this one. It was very well put together. The lights are incredible. My favorite part of the stand is how the BladeHawk Logo lights up.",

If you plug it into a wall USB charger it won't light up. The USB outlets in the stand will still provide power but it won't light up.I worked around this by plugging it into the usb port on my router and that allowed the light to work. If you are PC user you can just plug it into that.",
