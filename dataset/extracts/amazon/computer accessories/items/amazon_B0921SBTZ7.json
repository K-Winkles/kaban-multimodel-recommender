I am using them on the vertical side of the end table next to my chair to hold the charging cables for iPad, headphones, and Chromebook. Since I need micro USB, USB-C and Apple plugs, I have 3 different cables, and it\u2019s easy and convenient to pop one out and use it, then put it back in the clip. I will look for these again for cable management, as a consumer/end user.",
