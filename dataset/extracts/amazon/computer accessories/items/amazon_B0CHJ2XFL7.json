                "reviewText": "We have a tiny cabin and my 'office' is a dedicated work space that's about the size of your average closet! Space is always at a premium and with every new gadget or piece of equipment I have there's one more thing that I need to try and find a place to plug in and then I have to try and keep the wires corralled. I had never even thought 'out of the box' beyond a very large, clunky power strip!This thing is amazing. It takes up no room on the wall or floor, doesn't clutter up my already minuscule desk, and keeps everything in order. It has a dozen regular outlet plugs and 4 USB and 4 USB-C ports so you can cut back on how many charger bricks you're using! It's also a surge protector, so it offers another layer of protection to my electronics. I really like the fact that it clamps to my desk (no drilling or tacky adhesive!) which both secures it and allowed me to position it out of my way so I'm knocking into cords or getting them tangled underfoot. I can see how this power station could come in handy in several places around the house, like your entertainment area (TV, gaming consoles, sound bars, etc) or on the workbench where you might want to have several smaller things (chargers, radio, small tools) always at the ready without taking up all of your wall outlets!The unit itself seems well built and sturdy, and it looks nice. A weird thing to say, maybe, but it looks 'professional' if you will. It's not clunky, and it doesn't have any weird decorative flair. It's utilitarian without being ugly, so you won't mind if it's not hidden out of sight (unlike a lot of power strips I've used, which are often rather unattractive and hidden behind or under my desk, making plugging something in a nuisance).",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the CCCEI Desk Outlet Station for use on my garage work bench. Anyone with a work bench typically experiences the case where they have more devices than outlets and in recent years, the continual need to find USB chargers for various lights, modern soldering irons, etc. This outlet station caught my eye due to the large number of outlets, both USB and standard, as well as the clamp mechanism for attachment to a desk.My first impression out of the box was that the build quality could have been a bit better. The body itself is plastic that has a very slight flex to it and the main clamp is a bit weak for the main attachment point. When attached to the desk with the clamp, even screwing it down as hard as I physically could, there is still some slight flex and wobble. Moving forward, I am likely to remove the clamp assembly and directly screw the unit to my desk for a more secure hold. Something like an aluminum frame would have gone a long way in the constructions.My next gripe is that the plug exists the unit from the side rather than the rear. This causes it to push down against a desk if your outlet is underneath also causing a bit of shift or tilt. Had the cord exited the back, the unit would have sit more flush against the desk.I like that there are outlets on the back, top, and front. The outlets in the back are prefect for those devices one doesn't often unplug and the ones to the front and top are perfect for plugs on the fly. The inclusion of 45w USB C plugs are great for modern soldering irons that can be powered off USB-C as well as USB-A outlets for LED desk lights, phones, etc.Overall, the number of outlets, choices of USB, surge protection, etc. are a perfect combination for a workbench environment. Had the body been constructed of more durable materials such as aluminum and the power cord moved to the rear of the unit instead of the side, it would have been perfect.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great outlet and I can't believe I have been crawling under my desk all these years when this is available.First, this is a simple power outlet with lots of plugs... twelve 110v outlets to be exact. It also has four usb-a outlets and 4 usb-c outlets.It is made from lightweight plastic, not overly heavy duty but robust none the less. The clamp itself is metal though and holds well on the desk.The power cord is nice and long so reaching the wall outlet is easy.This is one of the best items I have ordered and keeps me from having to crawl under my desk. Having plenty of 110v outlets and usb-a and usb-c right on my desktop has simplified my life.This is an amazing buy and a great gift for someone with lots of things to plug in on their desk.",

This is the perfect solution. It clamps easy to my wood desk and it is not in the way at all. This item has twelve plug in outlets and 4 USB A ports and 4 USB C ports. This also has over current protection, short circuit protection, over voltage protection, and surge protection so it is meant to handle the needs of the modern world electronics. This is a must have item for desks and workstations. I highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I love that the fastener can be adjusted to fit a thicker or thinner desk without a ton of fastener turns. I am also at that age where my knees won't let me hit the deck as easily as I used to, so bringing everything up to desk level is better. This feels very solidly made, so I am not worried out anything sparking or overheating as long as there is ample airflow. Right now, it's long cord is plugged into my UPS so that's really the only reason I'd have to drop under my desk. Everything is easy to reach, including USB charging.",
