In addition, it is foldable for easy storage and easy to carry.",

The panel and its two hooks are designed with non-slip straps to make the laptop riser more stable, and 4 non-slip silicone pads at the bottom help prevent the computer riser from sliding. These considerate designs are to ensure you better use.",
            "\u3010Cooling & Ventilation\u3011The laptop holder only has two holder hands but not a whole flat, so there is more space to enable the heat to vent and keep your laptop from overheating.",
            "\u3010Muti-Use & Practical\u3011Multi-use in many occasions such as offices, meeting rooms, living room, kitchens and other occasions to hold the laptops. At the same time, the bottom storage slot can store small items such as mobile phones, keys, etc. An excellent gift for your friends and family!",

It take a little effort to position, but holds the position well. The base takes up a small footprint on my desk and allows me to use the laptop screen as a dual monitor. I've already had one coworker ask where I got it from and I sent them a link to order it. Probably the best thing I've ordered on Amazon in the last couple months.",

                "reviewText": "I have a standing desk and am used to switching often from sitting to standing. When I travel, I take this stand with me because I am to work at any desk and still get to stand or sit if needed. It is a pain in the butt to adjust, it's tough to fold, but once in place, it is very sturdy. When I am not traveling, I have it on my desk as a third screen and adjust it to the perfect height for video calls. great addition to your office set up if you work off a laptop.",

                "reviewText": "It's light and sturdy; I'm already considering buying one for my wife's desk.I used to use books to raise my laptop, but this takes it to another level (literally!). It's robust, and securely holds both my work computer and my 14\" MacBook without any issues. Initially, I thought I had to unscrew something on the stand to move it, but later I realized that you need to apply some force to move it. In my opinion, it's not the type of base you adjust every two to three hours; it's more the kind you set and leave, maybe moving it once or twice a week.I would definitely recommend it to my friends and purchase it again for my family.",
