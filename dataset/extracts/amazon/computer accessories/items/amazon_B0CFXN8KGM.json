                "reviewText": "I've had a hard time finding a floor mat that wasn't utter garbage, and though I've only had this one under me for a few days, so far so good. Wanted to get in an early review for the holiday shoppers in dire need of a floor mat.The biggest problem I've had with previous mats by far is apparently the age of the mats. It seems like most of these things (online, at local small stores, local big chain branches) have been sitting rolled up in a warehouse for years, alternating heat and cold, and essentially fossilizing in the tube shape they are stored in. It takes a week at best to get them to lay flat enough to set a chair on, and then they still curl at the edges. Without some secret conditioning technique I've never found, they also crack and split because the aged vinyl has become brittle. I thought thicker mats would handle that, but no dice, and in fact it may have been worse for both curls and cracks.This fellow, though, was evidently freshly harvested from the vinyl bush right before they boxed it and sent it over. I laid it under an area rug for 2 days because I forgot about it, but it probably didn't even need one. It didn't lift the rug at all even right away, and when I took it out and put it under my chair it was as if it had been born there. Dead smooth.There are no nubbies on the bottom to keep it from sliding when you move the chair, but I've put it over the top of one of my garbage-tier cracked ones and it hasn't slipped yet. The vinyl is on the thinner side but it's durable-feeling and pliant, so I think that's actually an asset here. The thick ones cracked worse in my experience.I dunno what more I can say - it's a literal floor mat. It didn't change my life per se, but it is protecting my carpet, I'm not tripping on the edges, and I'm not worried about cutting myself on broken plastic, so it's doing its job.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new mat for my husband's computer chair, and you wouldn't believe how expensive these things are. But if you're reading my review, then you DO know how expensive they are! This was a decently \"cheap\" mat, compared to a lot of the other ones out there. It works good, the chair rolls on it, doesn't really get stuck. We use it on a very thin rug, but it would definitely work better on a solid, hard floor (wood, tile, laminate, etc.). I knew that going into it though! After a bit of use, we did notice that the wheels do make small indents in the mat. Sometimes they bounce back, but not entirely. However, I knew it wouldn't be perfect, since it was a little on the cheaper side, and we were using it on a thin area rug. If you need a mat to do the job, and that's it, I recommend this mat. If you want something more durable and sturdy, I'd pick a different mat. OH yeah, when you get the mat, it is stiff as a board. You will need two people to unroll it and put it flat on the floor with something heavy on top of it. Watch the pokies on the bottom too. Overall, nice mat at a slightly cheaper price than others!",

                "reviewText": "I have this set up in my classroom. I LOVE it! It\u2019s perfect for my tiny space and makes it easier to move my chair around that tight space. It also keeps my carpet flat under my desk, which has been difficult. I'm in an elementary school classroom. I have 25 students and very little room to spare, so I have to use a small half student table as my desk ad squeeze in next to the radiator and under the phone. This makes it easy to maneuver. I didn't want to have to give up my comfortable chair since I am already trying to reduce my footprint in the class. It's been hard moving my chair around without lifting the carpet or getting tangled in cords. This has solved that problem. And since it's clear, it is very unobtrusive and doesn't stand out. Great Product!",
