                "reviewText": "I got this because my wrists remind me how slim and flat the Apple Magic Keyboard every evening as they pulse with discomfort from daily use. I was hoping it would provide me a better angle to use my keyboard, raise my hands so that my wrists are not resting on the hard corner of the edge of my desk all day and possibly provide me some extra desk space with the are beneath it being available to slide devices not currently being used beneath it. It definitely lifts my wrists off the edge and the cushion is waaaay more comfortable than the desk itself and I feel like the angle of my keyboard is much better suited for use with how wrists are naturally intended to bend, but since I have to use the thicker side of the cushion for that angle, the thinner portion of it blocks a lot of the storage area beneath and I wasn\u2019t able to fit most of the items I had hoped I could beneath it. That said, it fulfills its intended use perfectly and for just under $20 you can\u2019t beat the price compared to other options. I was worried sleek black acrylic would scuff easily and look cheap, but the cushion keeps your hands from gliding across it and it maintains a nice, polished and sleek look that fits perfectly with the carbon fiber and tech aesthetic of my desk. All in all I\u2019d recommend this to anyone in need of an affordable, simple and easy to use keyboard riser. Terrific product!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently added the Yikola Acrylic Keyboard Stand to my desk setup, and I couldn't be happier with the upgrade. This stand, with its sleek acrylic design, has made typing a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for me. The adjustable height feature is a game-changer, allowing me to find the perfect angle for my typing needs, significantly reducing wrist fatigue during long work sessions. The included wrist rest, with its smooth surface and breathability, adds an extra layer of comfort.What I also love about this stand is the thoughtfulness in its design. The non-slip feature ensures my keyboard stays securely in place, and the rounded edges mean no more scratches or discomfort. Plus, the space underneath is perfect for tucking away my keyboard, keeping my desk neat and organized. The clear acrylic also has a subtle elegance that showcases my keyboard's design. It's a simple yet effective solution that has transformed my workspace for the better.",
