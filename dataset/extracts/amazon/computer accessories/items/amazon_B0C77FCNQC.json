                "reviewText": "WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED:-Geeky GK61 Keyboard-Keycap Puller-USB-C to A cable-Quickstart GuidePRODUCT:This Review is for the Geeky GK61 60% keyboard. This keyboard comes in multiple switch types. This review is for the BLUE clicky switches. It is a wired Keyboard powered by a USB-C to USB-A CableYou have 61 keys max, which gives you a compact style designThere are no foot adjustments, but the KB itself has a moderate slope to accommodate the lack of that.Keys:Since this is a 60% keyboard you will have some reduction in space between keys, and certain keys will be cut down on their overall size such as your CTRL..etc However, most of the keys are still easy to type on and they are pretty standard keycap size. Images are included to show you. Measuring about 17.1mm wide and 11.3mm tall.RGB:The RGB lighting on this keyboard is backlighting and on the keycaps. It is NOT set lighting. It is dynamic, and all types of colors can be displayed in all zones on this keyboard.Software:Geeky Does provide software for this keyboard that you need to download from their website. The information is listed in the quickstart guide. I highly recommend you follow this so you can get software control over the KB. However, it is optional and if you want to control the lighting functions via key combinations only, you can do that as well.With the software, it\u2019s broken into 3 main tabsKey AssignmentLightingMacroYou also have your profile selector at the bottom. You can save up to 3 profiles.-key assignment:you can set your custom key functions. Keystrokes, Macros, Set a multimedia key. It\u2019s VERY customizable.-Lighting:You have 20 lighting modes to choose from including off. You can set the Brightness on every lighting mode, and adjust the speed on most lighting modes if it applies to that type. Some modes also require a color selection.-Macro:Your final section is a macro setup where you can record macros. Back on your key assignment area, you can then apply that macro to the keys you want.FINAL THOUGHTS:I got the blue switches which are VERY clickly. This isn\u2019t good or bad, it\u2019s simply preference. This is just something you need to be aware of. I\u2019m primarily a red switch user as I feel like that color offers the most well-balanced setup.-The keycap texture is a little gritty feeling. I notice this a lot on more inexpensive keyboards. It\u2019s not too bad though.-The size of most of your regular keycaps is pretty standard and I found them comfortable to use. I even was able to swap out my keys from one of my big name-brand KBs and they had no trouble fitting on each other, and the size of the Keycaps felt very at home. I\u2019ve added some pictures so you can see the millimeter size of a regular keycap.-I didn\u2019t notice any ghosting issues in all of my typing, which was quite extensive.-I only did some short gaming sessions, but again my performance was just fine. It felt like any other higher-end Blue switch keyboard. This is great considering this is a more low-cost solution-The RGB lighting is very vibrant, and since you get quite a lot of lighting options to choose from, you should find one that works for you.-Having software control is BIG BONUS. I can\u2019t tell you how many keyboards I\u2019ve tested that don\u2019t offer software. Everything is hardware-based. And while that might be fine for a lot of people, it always works best when you have the option for software control if you want it.-This model comes in quite a bit of switch options. Blue, Red, Silver, Black, and Brown. That\u2019s good news for such a lesser-priced keyboard. Anyone can pick the switch option that works for them.I think this is a great portable KB option. I kind of wish it had a battery as well, but that would also affect the pricing no doubt. However, even only being a wired board, it\u2019s still quite good with lots of lighting and switch options. Full macro abilities. Software control support. I think if you want a wired compact option, this might be for you. Just research the switch type you think you\u2019d like if you are not used to mechanical keyboards, and pick the one that sounds right for you.",
