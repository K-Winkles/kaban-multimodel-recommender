While there are alooooooot of tips, and I realistically probably will only ever need use of 10% of them, it was still worth it at the price point.at least at the date of purchase a 200 piece kit was barely more expensive than some of the 100 piece similar kits, so hey, why not spend a couple extra dollars for twice the amount.And if a situation comes where a certain tip is needed that I currently have yet to use arrive, at least i'll have it, and not need to buy another kit.",

                "reviewText": "This kit has all of the bits I need, and more, to do work on laptops and phones too, it seems. I don't work on phones though, but could possibly start now, or at least have fun tearing apart my old dead phones to see how the kit works.I have a habit of misplacing tool sets and when I needed to tear my laptop apart to replace the fan and keyboard, I couldn't remember where I put my old set of tools, as usual. I decided it was easier and would be faster, to just order another toolkit.I searched on Amazon and found this kit. It has more bits and tools, for more things than I can ever imagine using. Since the kit, to me, was such a great deal with all of the items included, I decided to buy 2, hoping I will be able to find set one or the other in the future, when needed.The price I paid, for this 190 piece kit, was less than I paid for the old kit I currently haven't found. I originally purchased a Webetop Screwdriver Set, 67 piece kit, in 2019 and paid $26.99 for it. The Webetop kit worked good though and if I had found it when needed, I would not have bought the new kit.I was impressed with this new kit. It has a nice holder and has almost 3x's the pieces of my old kit and I paid $25.42. For me, it was an awesome deal. The quality of the parts, in the kit, seem very good. The bits do not seem cheap or low quality. Only time will tell how well they hold up, but no bits last forever if you use them all the time. They wear out and need replacing from time to time.I used one of the kits to tear apart my laptop and had no issues with any of the tools I needed. Each item performed as I expected and in some cases, even better.I like the way the kit is organized and slots labeled. It is nice to have the little magnetic pad to place the screws and even write a note on, if needed. I never bother, it is more fun to guess where the screws go. LOLHaving such a well put together kit/holder, It will be easy to see if I have forgotten something when I am finished using it each time.The only problem with the kits that I did have ....... Unfortunately, one of the tool kits was missing 1 of the 164 bits. It is one that I would probably never use, but it is nice to have the complete kit. I contacted the company to let them know about the missing bit, via the message center here on Amazon. I received a reply from them within a couple of days and within a few days after that, the issue had been fully resolved and i had my 2 complete bit sets. I was impressed by how quickly the company responded and how easily and quickly the problem had been completely resolved. I would not hesitate to order something from them again, if the need should arise in the future.",

I made the mistake of not buying the heating pad/pouches for cell phones and iPad's at the same time. If you get one it should be temperature controlled.I wished it had more long small diameter bits than were included. I would gladly have paid more for a set of them to be included.",

I ended up replacing my drivers with iFixit drivers as the stock ones are a little scratchy but perfectly usable as it. They The carrying case is nice as well. Definitely a great value. Also, I wouldn't recommend getting it for the bit storage in the 1/4\" driver. While functional, it goes too low into the handle to be useful as you have to smack it a couple of times to be able to reach the bits. It is there if you are in a situation where you can't take the case but can take your 1/4\" driver so I still count it as a better to have and not need thing.",
