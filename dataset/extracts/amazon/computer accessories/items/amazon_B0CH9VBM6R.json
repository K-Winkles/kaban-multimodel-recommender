It clamps unto the side of the desk, which helps to eliminate and prevent clutter. The sizing is great and not bulky. I was afraid of having it on the edge of my desk might get in the way of when I am sitting, but that is not the case at all. The clamp is very secure and I have had no issues with it falling off. I have put my controller, headphones, some pens, a drink, and phone in the holder and have had no issues with durability. I love the convenience of the desk organizer having a cup holder, so I don\u2019t have to worry about a drink spilling on my desk. The performance of the desk organizer is great! I have had no complaints with how durable it is. The quality of the product is what seems to be hard plastic but sturdy. The product came well packaged with all the accessories wrapped up. I am honestly happy with this product to the durability, sturdiness, and design of the product. I definitely recommend for people who work from home or even game from their PCs. 10/10 product!!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love this organizer because it clamps right on to my desk, therefore saving precious desk space. It\u2019s a nice and neutral white color, and it\u2019s a super convenient way to store my extra controllers and my extra gaming headset. The clamp is very sturdy so it feels very securely attached to my desk. But it\u2019s also got soft padding on both sides of the clamping part so that your desk doesn\u2019t get scratched. I\u2019m very impressed with this little tool. Would definitely recommend!",
