Immediately I knew I needed one for myself.The installation and setup is easy. The boards are not the highest quality but at ~$30 expectations need to be tamed. I love the space and look it gave to my rising desk, especially getting matching color for the top shelves. What you don\u2019t notice is how neat the extensions are to expand or shrink your shelves horizontally. Mines are fully extended for my speakers and monitor to sit. The basket included is a nice touch and can be adjusted.All in all, I honestly think this is a great deal especially if you want to be budget friendly.",

                "reviewText": "Got this and I love it. Very easy to put together. If you've never put any furniture like this together before it could be a tad harder to figure out. Packed well and no damage. You will need one Phillips screw driver. The two top pieces simply slide around on a pin so they can go in, out or tilt. I have two 24 inch curved monitors as I work from home, I slightly tilted the two top pieces, and they are great. They give me room for pencils etc on the built in pockets on the sides, and you can slide things under. The quote drawer is not an attached drawer, but a plastic tray that slides on your desk in the middle back and forth. It has adjustable areas for pens etc. This product is simply great. Puts the monitors up about 6 inches or so. Keeps the desk more clear and tidy. Another great thing is you can choose from various colors to more closely your desk. Highly recommended.",
