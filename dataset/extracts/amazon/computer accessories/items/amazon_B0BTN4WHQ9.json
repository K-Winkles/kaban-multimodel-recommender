My intent was to replace using enviroduster cans since they get expensive. The additional objective of this purchase was to have a small vacuum to suck up the main part of the dust instead of just blowing it all over. The vacuum part of this works reasonably well, my only complaint is the battery life. I have to charge it between each computer or server cleaning, if it lasts through the whole process. For the blower purposes, it's pretty weak. I tried using both high and low power to blow dust out of tight places and it's effectiveness is minimal.",

The filter is not clogged. It might have something to do with the 'soft' switch that needs to be pressed for a moment before it starts. Nice case! Do not buy.",
