                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Way better than expected. This is a great tool & is going to end up saving me money.I run a small business that does a lot of scanning, copying & printing & our copy machines are always acting up because they get dust & debris in the gears. We used to go through a can of compressed air duster every other week. The cans never last long & are expensive. Then I discovered this rechargeable blower / duster.I love that it has 3 power levels & different attachments. I like the attachment with the bristles the best. It also seems to hold charge for a really long time. I've had it for a few months now & have yet to have to recharge it. I would've already gone through a few cans of compressed air in the time I've been using it & haven't had to charge it once. It also works great for keyboards & other electronics. It's very powerful & easy to use.My favorite part about it is how much money I'll now save from having to constantly order more cans of compressed air. I just wish I got one of these sooner.",

I thought the power might be a little bit stronger however with the brushes that come with it it's really not a big deal it gets the job done quite well. I think I was expecting more like the burst of air you get from a spray can however this is much better because I can keep using it and not have to wait for a spray can to warm up LOL. I do like that it has different speeds and is lightweight. I think one thing I would have liked to come with this is a little bag to hold the attachments. I do like this product and I plan to get one for my mom as a gift.",

                "reviewText": "I've been looking for an alternative to canned air for a while. A few would end up broken typically in transit when ordered at their head; it would never last as long as I needed for a variety of tasks.So after looking for a while for an alternative to help clean-up of several old window units for an older home, I stumbled on this device. For the purposes of blowing out the growing bits of dust and fodder that get caught in the filters on a weekly basis, it's been an excellent option when powered to its max to help blow out the junk as well as keep the internals of the window units up to snuff.With the different power level and the assorted attachments, you're free to tailor it to multiple uses whether you want a lower blast for computer and keyboard cleaning. And you're free to crank it up if blowing out the dusty build-up in your window sills.While you'll want to ensure it's powered up to full for the best results, its nice that both the unit itself and box make a large effort to give you all the essential information at once. Sometimes these products come with the bare minimal operating and set-up instructions, so it's nice to get some guidance outside the box and a hardly legible instruction manual.If you're after something affordable but versatile, it's a surprisingly nice pick-up for odd cleaning jobs.",
