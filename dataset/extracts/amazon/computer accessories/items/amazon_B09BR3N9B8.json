FN + LED: Switch between 1-color and 3-color breathing mode. 3. FN + PU/PD: increase/decrease backlight brightness. 4. FN + +/-: Speed up/slow down breathing rate. 5. FN+W: Exchange WASD and arrow keys. 6. FN + WIN: WIN key lock. 7. FN + (F1-F12): 12 multimedia combination keys.

Turning off the keyboard light can extend the battery life of the keyboard moderately. 7. If you can't press \"WASD\" or \"\u2191\u2193\u2190\u2192\", don't worry, please check if the FN function key is enabled.

They sent me a new one ans so far its working properly and Im a happy camper. If anything happens, I'll update again.OLD REVIEW:December 2023After 6 months of use, my keyboard and mouse lose connectivty ALL THE TIME! Which rally sucks because i do like the look of them, not really impressed with the color options available but it wasnt a big enough deal to make me want to return it. But now when I try to type either, for writing or for gaming, the key press doesnt registr or it doubles. The mouse is constantly turning off and all, fully charged. he mouse also loses connectivity. Both are used lightly. For refernce, Im a mom who uses her computr to google, shop, or play some games like miecraft or 7 days, nothing that causes massive button jamming. I did try to reconnect like the instructions above says to do and that made no difference.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this keyboard and mouse for a bit over a week. It only took about 2 hours for both the keyboard and mouse to fully charge from its initial partial charge, which is fairly reasonable. For the price, this really is a wonderful keyboard and a considerable upgrade from my old one. There is one HUGE issue though when considering that this is advertised as a gaming keyboard.Pros:- Easy to follow setup instructions- Comfortable to use for extended periods of time- Adjustable mouse sensitivity- Easy keycap removal and attachment- Affordable price pointCons:- Only rainbow LED options, no solid color- NO SCROLL LOCK!!!The lack of scroll lock is a HUGE oversight. I understand that there needs to be a way to toggle the LED color, but not overwriting an entire average keyboard function. There could have been another toggle switch/button or another hotkey including Fn like the LED brightness change. The scroll lock key is a default hotkey for a function in an MMO I play, so I am going to have to make a new hotkey and relearn some muscle memory.Also, while this is a nitpick in comparison, I feel it's a missed opportunity that the LEDs are so vibrant, even including a pastel scheme, but I can't make the board purely one color. Maybe that could have been implemented with a different way to toggle the LED.If you need a keyboard that feels good and does all your basic functions while looking sleek, I do still highly recommend this keyboard. Just keep the lacking scroll lock key in mind.",

The mouse has an up and down button for your mouse speed which is nice! However the fastest speed is a bit slower than what I'm used to so that will take some getting used to! All in all?

I\u2019ve charged it and yet it does not connect. I\u2019ve tried to charge and tried to use it again since, and it is still not working.***An update since my last review, the team at RedThunder has been working with me to resolve the issue. They are very prompt in responding as soon as I reported the non-functioning keyboard and mouse. I am moving my review to 3 stars because of the team\u2019s prompt response. Hopefully we resolve the matter soon.",

I have had this duo since Nov 2023 and I have only had to charge them once! I also switch from my desk top and laptop quite often and there is no needing to reconnect or anything it automatically connects right away. Works great and you can turn off the keyboard lights too if you want. I don't use it for gamming, i use it for work and i would absolutely buy it again, maybe in white if they have it. :)",

There is a small issue with pressingmultiple keys at once for gaming, not the worst.I chose the pudding keys and they are very satisfying to press, very silent but has a niceticking sound when typing.The LED is very good, very vibrant, multiple color options, you will need to set every time you turn on.The mouse is useful but for highly competitive gaming do avoid. It does not have a fast enough responsetime or mouse speed to keep up. You will need to use an alternate mouse.Otherwise if you play a regular speed game, the mouse is suitable.Unfortunately you cannot set the mouse color at all, it will always alternate to flashing color, there is a switch for no light.I like that the mouse goes to sleep and saves battery power, just right click to wake up.Wish there was an app to tell me how much battery power is left, maybe in future?I did have to pair the mouse with keyboard first time.This is perfect for office work, compared to cheaply made wireless keyboards, this out performsby a mile. You feel an improvement in the mouse/keyboard response time, also the backlit keysmake typing more confident than a non lit, using the function F12 key for calculator is great.I doubt you will be disappointed with this purchase.",
