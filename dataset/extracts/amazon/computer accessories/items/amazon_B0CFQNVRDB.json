I have tried other seat cushions but nothing helped relieve the pain I was feeling. I bought this seat hoping it would work and it does!! I no longer have the pain in my Tailbone. This has a nice rubber bottom to it so it does not slip and slide all over the seat. The memoryFoam hugs my bottom, giving great support! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this product. I would recommend this seat over any other. Great product and great buy!",
