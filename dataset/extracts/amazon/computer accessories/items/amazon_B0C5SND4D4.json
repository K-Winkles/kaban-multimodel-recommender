I was pleasantly surprised to find that the suction on this thing is pretty strong. I used it for cleaning the interior of my computer and keyboard and it was very effective. I haven't yet tried the \"blower\" mode because I don't want to just move the dust into the air. Before buying this unit I was using canned air dusters. The problem with the canned air is that it blows the dust around and you have to keep replacing air cans. This gadget is good because you can recharge it. You can also keep it plugged in (recommended) when using the vacuum feature. It also comes with a nice hand tool for lifting the keys off of your computer keyboard to get underneath.",

                "reviewText": "After years of dealing with condensed air spray cans and their chemical residues, this seems like a great way to regularly maintain my electronics. My home office is in a tiny room but still manages to collect dust like crazy. My desktop has fans and filters that need to be regularly cleared of dust on top of having my keyboard and workspace also needing maintenance.Thanks to the many accessories provided with this duster, I can easily blow, vacuum, and brush away loose dust and lint. Obviously, you'll want to do this outside - just make sure to unplug all your computer stuff. The duster has a long-lasting battery - I've only charged it fully like twice since I got it. It's a great portable cleaner not just for PC and laptops but also for your car's dashboard. My only issues are that the suction power isn't super powerful so you'll need to make a few passes to pick everything up and also that the smaller attachments can get lost so you'll want to keep them all together in the same box.",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent little vacuum that's great for your keyboard as advertised, but it's also good for those little crevices in the seats in your car. I also tried it on the sofa for just some crumb cleanup up and it worked fine. I even tested it on my baseboards. Basically, any place where there might be a little dust or a hard-to-reach place, this is perfect to help clean it up. The suction power is fine. I love the multiple-head attachments though. For the price, it's not a bad little vacuum cleaner.",
