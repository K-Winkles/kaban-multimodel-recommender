                "reviewText": "I've recently reviewed a number of under-desk cable management trays. All seem to have their individual pros and cons. Some you can adjust the width on. Some have a base that amounts to a big piece of bent wires that pretty much lets cables come in and out at any angle, making it really easy to access and mess with behind a desk but which looks like a rats nest if left visible.All of them seem to come with a bunch of extras in the form of ties and sticky cable holder things and all have pretty good ventilation which, combined with keeping a power strip or other hardware off the floor, helps keep everything cool.This particular unit falls into a mesh subset of these designs. The potential disadvantage I see with this design - and this one is no exception - is that the mesh isn't all that thick and feels like, with constant use, will get bent up and distorted over time. It's probably not going to outright break but if you're messing with stuff in it on any regular basis, it's probably not going to stay pretty.With this style, they like to also show off how it can be used as under-desk storage for things other than cables but with this particular design, if you're looking to use it for cable management, there are a couple of nice features I'd like to point out.First, the top edge is angled. It starts out tall on the back and gets lower towards the front. This makes accessing whatever you put in it a lot easier without sacrificing much. The other thing I like about it, is that the \"portholes\" on the ends, intended to be where the cables go in and out, have a narrow opening at the top.That second thing may not seem like all that big of a deal and if you plan to set this up once and forget about it, it's not but if you live in the real world, over time, you're going to be needing to get to this thing to add and remove stuff and in that scenario, not having to snake power plugs with their chunky ends closest and potentially thinner device plugs on the other end being at the other end of 3-6' of cable, this is a really nice feature that'll allow you to take something in and out of this setup without having to devote 30 minutes to getting everything connected back up when you're done.The mesh style seem to do a better job of organizing cable setups in a way that looks neat and less cluttered in general but the same things that make them look nicer also, to some degree work against them in terms of flexibility. This design, is a pretty well thought out way to address that shortcoming.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a cable management system that would move up and down with my standing desk and this is the perfect solution. Before I got this, I considered mounting my surge protector under the desk, but then I would have to do more work to hide all the cords that went to it. Now I can just wrap up my cords and store them in the tray. This tray also came with a couple of cable management ties and stickies. I used the ties to secure the cord from my surge protector to my desk leg, so now everything is nice and tucked away.This tray fits my 12-inch surge protector perfectly, and there was enough room left over to store the battery block from my monitor in there too. But I don't think it could fit much more in there, so this might not work for someone who has a lot of stuff to plug in (or you will have to use extra cable management to hide your cords).Overall I'm very pleased with this! It's a simple way to get the cords off my desk and floor. The perfect low-tech solution for me.",
