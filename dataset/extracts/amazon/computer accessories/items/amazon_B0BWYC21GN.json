                "reviewText": "Only one annoyance I found in this mousepad so far the charger gets warm so you don't wanna leave it on all day long. However they are aware of the issue and gave solutions to make it be less warm during the charge so thats a plus. Normal USB will make it toasty just plug it into your Red USB if you have them or get a usb adapter thats good. The mousepad otherwise feels great and looks like they fixed one of the complaints it not staying flat mine was instantly flat when i put it on my desk. Does feel slick compared to cheaper mousepads so if you like a smooth surface its good. I feel like to help the heat they should of added more thermal paste and maybe a small fan if they can find a spot. Only suggestions to improve it. Also might notice a factory smell to the mousepad lol hopefully that goes away after awhile.",

I think that the 15 watt pad wireless charging is better then the 10 watt. The 15 watt pad is so easy finding the wireless charger cause its raised. And the best is this has samsung fast wireless charging. Apple i don't know about yet. But I do know this has magnetic apple charging. Not on the 10 watt pad. U do need a high powered charger for the fast charge. But other then that there great. I will buy more in the future. Ps I do like the rgbs on the 10 watt pad. And these have usb c. Thats the best the 10 watt pad has micro usb. i have 1 pad with usb c to c and the other pad usb c to usb a.",
