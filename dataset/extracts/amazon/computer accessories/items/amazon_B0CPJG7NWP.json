                "reviewText": "Amazing\u2014great buy!! Love this bag for work and general outings!I was slightly skeptical to get this bc of some of the negative reviews about a \u201cfishy smell\u201d; that there\u2019s no padding for the outer side of the laptop section; and that the bag falls over. ALL of those complaint-reviews seem like an exaggeration to me.I got this bag in Jan 2021 and there is absolutely NO BAD SMELL to this bag at all!! I was fully prepared to have to air this out like people mentioned, but this arrived and is completely normal with zero smell. I put it up to my face to smell it and stuck my nose inside the pockets, and it\u2019s exactly like any normal bag you would buy at a store... I have no idea where people are getting that there\u2019s a smell.As far as the padding issue goes\u2014my laptop actually fit perfectly in the \u201ciPad\u201d section so that it was fully padded on both sides. I also have an even bigger laptop that fits here as well (as long as I place it slightly diagonal). Putting my laptop in the \u201ciPad\u201d section also means I don\u2019t have the issue of the bag falling over like some reviews mentioned. I think people forget to consider the measurements before buying things like this, and that may be the problem here.Overall this is an amazing bag!! I took a photo in natural light to see it better, but the material is durable, the color is true to the description (and LOVE the deep green!), and it holds a ton of stuff. It is also lightweight, but doesn\u2019t feel or look cheap to me. I will also note that the inside of the crossbody strap (removable) is made of a rope material (see pic), which makes it more comfortable on your shoulder than the solid leather on the outside of the strap. The photos show the metal parts as silver, but I love that it\u2019s gold on the green bag! (I can\u2019t speak to the other colors if they have gold or silver pieces.) There are also little pegs on the bottom to keep the bag from getting dirty or damaged. Love all these features!This is a fantastic laptop tote for this price and I highly recommend it!!",

It's very professional looking, but also very sturdy and water-resistant (which I have yet to test).It snuggly fits everything I need, laptop and bulky makeup bag included. Plenty of compartments and pockets. The navy blue is gorgeous.My bag had some defects with the stitching. There is also a crease on the side that I'm hoping softens as I use it.Overall, happy with the bag for the price.",

The capacity is excellent - I carry my laptop, iPad, chargers, phone, files and paperwork, and miscellaneous smaller items easily. In fact, I can cram more into it than I can easily carry due to weight, so I have to remind myself of that. After five years, nary a rip or fray or popped stitch. It doesn\u2019t scuff, the straps are intact and it doesn\u2019t pick up dirt or grime. Fortunately, it\u2019s pretty as well, or I\u2019d be tired of looking at it by now. Definitely a purchase I\u2019d recommend!",
