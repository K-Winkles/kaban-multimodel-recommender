                "reviewText": "This item works as intended and is really easy to install/set up. The material feels fairly sturdy, and doesn\u2019t feel cheap to me. That being said, I wouldn\u2019t be too rough with it if I were you (wouldn\u2019t want to push my luck). It looks nice and not as bulky as I imagined it would.However, I would like to note that the white color is not a true, bright white. It\u2019s definitely a more neutral or warm white, and likely won\u2019t match your electronic aesthetic if you have white electronics. For example, if you have a white Xbox with white controllers and a matching white Turtle Beach Bluetooth headset, this hook is a very noticeably different shade of white from all of those items. Such is the gamble of buying white gaming accessories. I had a feeling I should\u2019ve gone with black just to err on the side of caution, but I didn\u2019t and now my aesthetic is displeasing.Aside from that, this hook is easy to set up and easy to mount. It has excellent silicone pads for the mount to grip to your surface, as well as silicone pads on the controller mounts to help them stay in place. The item works as intended and I\u2019m pretty happy with its functionality. Overall, I\u2019d recommend this product with the caveat that you stick with a color other than white so that your aesthetic remains pleasing to the eye.",

It also uses a spring for clamping, so you don't need any tools, and you can reposition it easily. I'm pleased with it.",
