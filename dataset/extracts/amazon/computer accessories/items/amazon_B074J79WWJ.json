                "reviewText": "I bought this because I needed to connect an HDMI monitor at my office to my 2018 Macbook Pro 15\" and wanted something to match the Space Gray finish of my laptop.Tl;dr: This product far exceeded my expectations in almost every way, and when I came across a minor issue (that was completely my fault), the seller responded immediately and was able to guide me.DISPLAY:Using this, I was able to output at the advertised 4K resolution. I did not experience any significant heat from the device and the picture was as sharp as the native 4K USB-C monitor I have at home. I did not experience any lagging or other issues.My MacBook also did not use any more power or processor utilization displaying via this adapter when compared to the same video played on a native USB-C monitor.FINISH & BUILD QUALITY:The adapter is built really well. It's not very heavy but feels solid and, from the outside, feels exactly like my MacBook. The ports themselves are high quality. There's almost no play when cables are plugged in and overall look and feel very high quality.The finish of the adapter matches my MacBook extremely well. If it weren't for the MOKIN logo, I would believe it was an Apple-made adapter.Capturing the finish in pictures was hard to do since the light hit it at different angles, but in person it matches almost perfectly.SD & USB:I didn't really buy the product for this, but it's definitely a nice touch and I find myself not having to reach for individual dongles as much, since this one does the job. It makes a difference only having one cable plugged directly to the laptop. Obviously there's going to be a speed hit going from USB-C to USB-A due to native differences in speed, but I tested this against an Apple OEM USB-A adapter by moving a battery of files to and from a USB flash drive and there was no real difference in speed between the two.I did the same test with the same files on a Samsung SD card and found the same results.OVERALL:This is a truly exceptional device. It's built very well and performs as well or better than OEM Apple adapters while looking a whole lot better. All of this paired with the exceptional support from the seller make this a no brainer for me.I don't write reviews often because products rarely stand out to me, but I emphatically recommend this product and the company that stands behind it.I will update in 6 months after I'm able to put some wear on it with daily use.",

                "reviewText": "This is a must for any new owners of the new mac book pros! Hate that apple only has usb-c ports on the new laptops and that I didn't realize it until too late. Do not like how i have to have all these random adapters plugged into my computer. This adapter is a good small size, however, I wish the wire was removable. The wire is really stiff and I'm worried it's going to get damaged from trying to compact it in my bag. I used this item for my 16\" MBP. The first time I plugged it in it didn't easily go into my computer. I stuck it into a different port and it finally went in fine. I plugged my external hardrive into the adapter and some previous comments are correct--it does take a little longer to read. But for the price and the fact that it had usb ports and a sd card reader, this is a pretty good buy. Note I only just received this and only used it a handful of times so I don't know how long it will last.",

For the HDMI port, I have never had any issues with it while connecting it to my external monitor. For the SD card port, I will say that it does require some level of effort to insert the SD card, but once you do, my computer has been able to read it. Definitely get this if you're on the fence.",
