                "reviewText": "I bought this along with another adapter because I've had bad luck with these adapters breaking in the field. While I ultimately chose the other adapter (the Uni) as my main unit, this one works perfectly well. With covered connectors and recessed slots, it seems to hold up well in the woods.It's more compact than the Uni adapter because it doesn't have a connector cord. A downside is that without this cord, you have a rigid connection to your smartphone, which can stress if mishandled. Also, for woodland use, it would be nice if the end caps were tethered to the body, but this \"feature\" can be a nuisance. The caps will keep the connector ends from being damaged if this is shoved into a backpack.Finally, a small unit that supports both USB-A and USB-C is a real plus, though not so much for smartphone use.",
