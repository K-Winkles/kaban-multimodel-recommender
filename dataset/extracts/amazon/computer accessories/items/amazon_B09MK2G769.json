The small button at the top of the pen is non-functional, but the pocket clip appears to be fairly rugged. The \u2018footprint\u2019 of the stylus can be varied by tapping vertically (large area) or angling which creates a smaller area. Drawing with this stylus will not create precise lines as can be had using a hard drawing stylus. In all, this a very good value for the money and the cost is low enough (in quantity) that it won\u2019t break your wallet if you lose it.",

                "reviewText": "These stylus pens are absolutely, incredibly, awesomely, amazing! I actually use these pens with my Korg delay analog ribbon synthesizer. The tips are very soft and cause no damage whatsoever to the ribbon synthesizer. The quality of the pen is super stable, yet very light. The rubber tip is very durable. I move the stylus pen sometimes vigorously, and the rubber tip, and the pen itself, hold up perfectly with my playing music. I absolutely love these stylus pens. The colors are beautiful, and they would make an excellent gift for someone who texts a lot on the cell phone, or who uses small synthesizer devices where fingers could seem a little bit too big. I am very, very, very happy with these awesome stylist pens!",
