I love being able to just set this in my lap and prop my tablet up on it. So much easier than holding it because let\u2019s face in our hands are going to get tired of holding a big huge tablet. Overlook the smudge marks. Tried to clean it off before I took a picture. Lightweight, super soft and even has a little pocket on the side that you could put earbuds or a little charger in. It has a zipper where you can unzip it and hand wash it if you spill anything on it. I would hand wash it and cold water and hang it to dry. 10/10 would recommend this!",

It is so convenient to hold up your phone, tablet, tap screen laptop or even as I have used it for my book. Much easier on your neck because you're not bending down as much and also better on your posture because you can sit up without bending over the electronics screens. It's one of my top 10 favorite things this past season.",
