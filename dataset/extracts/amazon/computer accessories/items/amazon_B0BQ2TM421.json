ThIs stand is incredibly strong, never ever droops, stays where you adjust it and serves for all sorts of applications. When using my laptop for normal use, I prefer to keep it a bit elevated but in a position that does not encourage carpal tunnel (for which I have already had surgery on my left hand). That means reversing the normal postion so that the laptop is tilted slightly downward in the back and very slightly up in the front. When I am using the laptop for zoom calls, I use the stand in its normal position and can not only raise the height to multiple levels but can also angle the top so that my camera is at the height I desire -- and nothing droops or moves even when typing on the laptop keyboard. The stand is very stiff and may take two hands to position, but will not droop or ever lose its position. I also expect this stand to last forever. As if that's not enough, it is designed so that there is space underneath the laptop that prevents overheating. And the price is definitely reasonable. My advice: BUY THIS -- YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!",

It is so much more useful than that. Elevating my laptop by just a few inches has helped with wrist fatigue, allows me to stand at my desk and continue working, and allows me to keep my desk tidy. I am able to place documents closer and allows me more desk space in my small office. It is easy to lift up or down or adjust to the perfect height.",
