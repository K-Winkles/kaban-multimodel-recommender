                "reviewText": "The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was the stand it self. Cheap basic plastic. Once you put it together and secure it to the base, is sturdy and functional. But, once you place your headphones, it's the one thing you never notice. I was very impressed with the base of the stand. It's heavy and very functional. The two USB ports and the type C port work very well, and allow me to keep everything else organized. My Samsung wireless earbuds, my Amazon watch and the most important device, my headphones. I bought the Odio A70 and I love them so much. They fit on my stand perfectly and having a short cable and out of the way made it more attractive. I also charged my water pick and also a pair of neck fans without having a huge mess of cables all over the place because I had short cables available. For the price, it was more than I was expecting. My daughter, my son and my girlfriend want one. Once my girlfriend saw the RGB lights, that made her want one for her PS5 headphones. It adds a nice touch to your night stand or your computer desk if you're into gaming.",

                "reviewText": "After researching a lot of options for a headphone stand, this was by far the most multipurpose, functional, and attractive. The LED lights are a nice complement to the lights on my headphones. I constantly use the USB plugs to both charge my headphones and other devices. Having extra outlets on top of that is just a great bonus. The stand itself is a plastic bar that sticks in the base, and it swivels a bit, so maybe not the most sturdy option, but it's more than fine for just resting and charging my headphones. I'm very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend!",

The surge protector and elector plugs make it convenient to charge other gaming things at the same time. It is also much cheaper than most of the PC accessory name brand like Razer, but offers more than they do. It also has different color glow modes if that makes a difference to your purchase. Fantastic buy, people need to know more about these honestly.",

It takes little room on my desk and is so nice because I cant just rest my headset on it and charge it over night.Assembly was just fitting one piece in the other. Highly recommend this product!",
