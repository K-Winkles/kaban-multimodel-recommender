                "reviewText": "These power blocks offer plenty of AC sockets and a good mix of USB ports. The priduct is very solid when clamped to the desk, and they have a clean look. I avoided buying this type of product initially because all of the ones shown tilted backward beyond the back edge of a desk. That is not suitable for a desk or bench flush with the wall. Note there is still minor interference in the rear of these because the power cable comes out the back, but the back slants forward, giving some relief to the tight squeeze.Bonus: the clamp can actually be fitted through a 2\u201d grommet hole (with the grommet removed). I ran the cable into the hole first, then inserted the clamp. You have to extended to clamp screw fully to do ghis, but it works fine.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little power strip I purchased during a \"Lightning Deal\" during Prime Days for $30. While that is a bit pricey, I needed a power strip to attach to a metal desk frame and this works perfectly. I do like that the outlets are spaced far enough apart so I can utilize all outlets when some of the plugs are the larger brick type. This model comes with 3 outlets, 2 USB-A, and 2 USB-C outlets. The USB outlets are quick charging. They do offer a 5 outlet power strip as well. The clamp securely attaches to the frame and does not move when unplugging cords. Of note...the product description says it is a surge protector and the box says \"overcurrent protection\" with no mention on level of protection. Overall, pleased with this purchase.Update: Taking one star off as the USB outlet does not always work with the little light I use at the desk. I have to use a brick and take up an outlet when using the light.",
