Why does the graphics card data not move? Usually notebook users, the independent display is usually on standby, and only the core display is used to save energy, while the secondary screen monitors the more important independent display, so of course the graphics card monitoring data does not move. 3. Can other content be displayed? No, only the content set by the custom software can be displayed 4.USB interface version? USB1.0, USB2.0, USB3.0 are not limited, as long as it is USB 5.

Easy as that. I went with the \"note\" theme, cause it went well with my case motiff.That said it does come with a good selection of layouts and themes. However this 3\" version is alittle hampered by it's size when it comes to the themes. Some are hard to see, especially if the unit is tucked away. You can edit them, and make your own, however the instructions and even the software is poorly translated. Thats why i took a star off and gave it 4. Again though, the software is easy to run, just the theme editing is trial and error.All said its a great simple to us monitor that really makes your case stand out.i like it soo much i ordered the 5\" version for my other build.",

                "reviewText": "Love it! Nice, vivid display and was easy to install. It doesn't come with anyway to mount it to flat surfaces so make sure you have some double sided tape or similar if you plan to do that. I used a 10pin internal USB to USB female adapter to power it from inside my case. The software is pretty messy, but there's an alternative open source version that's a little nicer. In both cases though, making the theme was a bit confusing but once you figure it out it's easy to make whatever you want. I have it displaying CPU and GPU load and temps, volume, network usage, plus my time. It can display weather too!",

When I first installed and ran the software, a message popped up regarding an issue with my I7 13700K Raptor Lake processor. I'm at work and can't recall the exact message but there appeared to be a need to update the software to accommodate the latest architecture. It runs fine for a few minutes then shuts down.For those asking about downloading the software, the instructions come with a QR code that provides the link to it. There is also a URL link but the instructions are mostly in Chinese. The software links do have english versions.",
