I've been looking for a laptop stand for a while and while most seem cool, I went for functionality over form.This thing is easy to setup. It came with instructions and a guide for how to use multiple laptops. Assembly was easy. Simply use the included Allen wrench and screws to attach the sides to the base. The base and sides are sturdy, durable plastic.I screwed the sides so I could adjust, set my laptop in and then tightly screwed the sides. Its very sturdy and it allows the laptop to stand straight up.I'd keep the extra screw and wrench in the little zippie bag tapped to the stand. Overall, I'd buy this again. Great product.",

It\u2019s not heavy or sturdy enough to adequately hold a laptop without fear of it falling over, either. It does hold it, so technically it works as described which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1. Definitely better options out there",
