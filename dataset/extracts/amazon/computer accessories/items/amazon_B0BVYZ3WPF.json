                "reviewText": "This product is fantastic. I had been looking for a mouse pad for a long time and reluctantly decided on this one. And I am so glad I did because it is perfect. I got the dragon design and it could not look any better. The image looks exactly as shown and the eyes genuinely look like they are glowing. I do agree with some of the other reviews that said the items had a spray paint smell and that did bother me at first. But by the next day, the smell was gone.Features: The wrist support is great, definitely something I never thought I would need but it relieves so much strain. It's comfortable and the material is extremely soft. The bottom side of the mouse pad has a sticky surface of it that strongly holds it in place on my desk. I loved this because I didn't even know it had that feature. The actual mouse pad is perfect for any mouse. It's soft and flat enough for your mouse to easily glide around.The only thing I was disappointed with was that it did not come with an option to just buy the mouse pad without the keyboard wrist support. I figured I wouldn't use it and could save some money. But as soon as it arrived and I saw the quality of the items, I didn't care. They're just so nice!Anyway, that's my review! I highly recommend to anyone who wants to protect their mouse and their wrists. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!!!!",
