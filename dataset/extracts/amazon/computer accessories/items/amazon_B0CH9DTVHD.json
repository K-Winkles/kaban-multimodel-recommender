I can plug this 'mini-dock' into the DELL when working, and into the MAC on the weekends. This gives me everything to connect a wired keyboard and mouse, monitor and ethernet, and a Timemachine drive on the MAC. Then I connected a USB 3 hub to it and now I have plenty of expand-ability for my wireless headset and to use with USB sticks. And if I travel, just throw it in the bag and i get the ports I need without taking up much space.",

This multiport expander lets me hook up all those without a problem, and lets me charge through it as well, which frees up the second USB-C port. It also provides an HDMI video port, in case you need one. The price is also very good. I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this USB-C hub to allow me to quickly connect my laptop to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. With 1 HDMI port, 2 USB-A ports (USB 3.0), 1 USB-C port (100W PD), an SD card slot, a MicroSD card slot, and a 1 Gbps Ethernet port, this packs a lot into a small form factor.While I didn't have a 4K monitor to test, I tested both mirroring and extending my desktop onto a 1080p monitor, and both worked fine. Windows 11 reported the refresh rate at 60 Hz, as indicated in the product description.I tested the wired Ethernet and it negotiated successfully at 1 Gbps, as shown in my photos.Overall, this will be fine for travel, but it certainly doesn't replace a more expensive docking station given the short length of the USB-C cable and the fact that it only has two USB-A ports. However, putting things into perspective, an \"official\" docking station made by my laptop's manufacturer is over $500. Although I still find this device a bit pricey for what you get, it suddenly doesn't seem so expensive when you think of it that way.What's in the Box\u25a1 USB-C hub\u25a1 Carrying case\u25a1 User manualThings I Like\u2713 Plug-and-play. As soon as I plugged it in, I was able to use my connected USB peripherals, and the monitor and Ethernet connected just fine.\u2713 Compact, meaning it will be handy to keep in my laptop bag for travelling\u2713 I may not be in the majority, but as an IT professional, I prefer the speed and stability of wired Ethernet connections, so I appreciate that this device has an Ethernet port\u2713 The box lists RoHS and FCC markings (but no FCC ID), while the product itself bears the CE and FCC markings (but no RoHS marking). It's hard to know if these are genuine, but I like to see themAreas for Improvement\u2717The USB-C cable connecting the device to your laptop is really short. It would be nice to have a longer cable (or a detachable cable, so that I can use whatever length of USB-C cable I like)\u2717I'd personally prefer more USB-A ports in lieu of the SD / MicroSD card slots. Two USB-A ports won't go far, particularly if you've got a wired keyboard and mouse\u2717 The product photos on this listing show a braided cable. The product I received does not have a braided cable, which would be nice to have for extra protection against breakage\u2717The carrying case is pointless and just adds waste",
