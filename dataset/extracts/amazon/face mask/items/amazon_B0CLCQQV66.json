                "reviewText": "This product has great reviews, and they obviously did not receive what I did. The mask gives good coverage if you hold it there with your free hand, but the elastic pulls away from the anchor point on the mask when you try to put it on. If you manage to get one on, it will pop loose and fall off after wearing a few minutes. The problem is either the anchor design or the glue used to attach the elastic strap to the mask. Failure rate has been 100% in 10 masks. I just got these a week ago, but it says they are \u201cnot returnable for safety reasons\u201d. Funny because I cannot use them for the same reason- \u201csafety reasons\u201d. A mask that will not attach to your head and cover your nose and mouth is useless, hence my critical review. My friend who was here to help me sand some boards broke three without ever getting one on his head. I think there should at least be a place to contact the business to tell them what the problem is, but alas, there is not. When you go to \u201c return or replace\u201d it says nothing about a refund option, or a replacement option, just that they are not returnable. Although not very expensive, this is truly the worst product I have ever purchased thru Amazon.",
