While you can't really tell a difference from mask to mask once opened, it's still fun to have the variety to choose from and have a ton of sheet masks handy. I like that the masks come adhered to a plastic sheet you peel the mask off of, feels more expensive idk why. You get tons of extra essense in each pouch that I use to get another round out of the mask or for my neck, arms etc. Overall I would definitely buy again, worth every penny and more",

You can out them on your face then peel off the backing and it's that easy. I love to take the rest of the moisture and rub it all over my chest and shoulders. The price is also awesome. I will be purchasing these again when I run out which will be soon. Lol a must have ladies. And they are so refreshing on your face.",
