                "reviewText": "I have very sensitive skin that can become overly dry from too much over scrubber or harsh products. If I have a break out which I sadly have been having really bad cystic like zits pop up due hormone changes from medication and tons and tons of stress. I'm not used to the cystic acne and it hurts so very bad. I also did have some blackheads on a few parts of my face that kept reappearing no matter what I did. With other masks I had used, they never seemed to get the blackheads. I did some research on dead sea mud. Honestly, the cystic zits hurt so bad, we're so hideous, I had never had such bad breakouts in years. It's always when a medication changes something hormonal. It's awful. I ordered this product, based on the photos other people had sent in. I feel along with the descriptions of the actual products ingredients, the aloe scent, it's functions, the good reviews, the pictures were a nice visual aid from satisfied customers.Not only was I suffering in pain with these cystic zits, but I was horribly embarrassed. Nothing seemed to minimize their size. Halloween. My favorite of holidays was coming up. Just to minimize these would be a blessing. To soothe would ease my suffering. I figured I couldn't expect more. Zits like that are not cured fast. They are deep, big and take time to heal...So, here's the thing, I apply the mask, it felt amazing. My whole face, even non-affected areas felt soothed and refreshed. I really love the way it feels going on. The gentle rub off. To my surprise, those stubborn black heads that no mask had gotten before we finally gone. Well that was sure a awesome bonus! All my pores not that I have big pores naturally but we all can look uneven when we have been fighting a battle on our face. My pores felt clean, soothed, smooth skin, refined. The cystic zits, was the most shocking. In one application they had indeed gone down in size dramatically. They finally started to hurt less. With every hot and cold compress prior. Nothing soothed or reduced the size as long as this mask. HONEST. As someone who wears makeup, and is very self concise about having a zit you can't hide. Or a very painful stubborn kind. I would and HAVE recommended this to friends. I see a friend this week who has a teen sister with skin problems and you bet I am sharing not just any \"dead sea mud mask\" but this brand specifically.I truly am impressed with the results.I have had professional facials and this does feel as soothing, refreshing and has astounding results.In the past other masks I have tried never felt as much as a at home luxury as this one does.Plus the benefits are numerous. It does not dry our your skin. I felt nicely moisturized, in the most natural way. I did not feel any artificial residue or anything like that.I don't know what, more I can say. I hope my long review was helpful. I wanted to add as much as possible so it covered it all.How fast acting it was. It's soothing effects. Natural moisture. Swelling reduction. The cystic acne cleared up considerably faster. Black heads gone completely unlike other masks. Lovely smell. No drying. No negative reactions on my sensative skin. Smooth skin. Pore refinement.*I Hope to add photos in the future*",

I bought this product to help reduce acne, blackheads, and to refine/brighten my skin. It feels cool and refreshing upon application. I let it completely dry for about 20-30 min and wash off with warm water. I try to use it two to three times a week and feel it works very well! I feel and look refreshed! My skin has significantly improved and my pores are gradually getting smaller and are less noticeable. I will be purchasing more in the future and absolutely love it!",

                "reviewText": "Great product. Feels great on my super sensitive skin. It left my skin smooth and refreshed after washing off. For all the people saying this product burns it is because 1 of 3 things is causing it: open cut on your face, itritated acne, you shave or waxed your face. The product has salt in it. Salt burns irritated areas on your face (feels like going into ocean after shaving your legs). For all the people saying they got acne from this product, its because: you didn't wash the product off completely with warm water OR this product opens up your pores very well and causes debris to come into the pores easier. Wash your face with water and moisturize with a light weight oil free moisturizer.",

Add a dollop in the palm of your hands, rub together to warm it up and thin it down. Massage all over your face.After a few minutes you will begin to feel a slight warm sensation. Wash off with a very damp facecloth. ( and use a crappy cloth). Your skin will look amazing after it is all washed off.",

It doesn't dry and tighten your face like many mud face packs you can get in chemists. I left the face mask on for 10-15 mins and washed off with warm water. My face now feels as soft as a baby's bum and looks clean and bright. I noticed some light reflecting particles that had been left on my skin, which I wasn't expecting, which adds extra glow! Very nice product, look forward to continued use.",
