                "reviewText": "The 100 Pack Disposable Face Masks have proven to be a reliable and practical choice for everyday use. As someone who values safety and hygiene, having a large quantity of these masks on hand has been advantageous.The three-ply filter protection provides an added sense of security during these uncertain times. The masks fit comfortably over the nose and mouth, with a secure elastic ear loop design that ensures a snug fit without feeling overly tight or uncomfortable.I appreciate the convenience of having a large quantity in one pack, as it saves me from frequent trips to replenish my supply. The individual packaging of each mask is also a thoughtful touch, making it easy to carry them in my bag or pocket when I'm on the go.The black color of the masks is a practical choice, as it doesn't show stains or marks as prominently as lighter-colored masks do. It also adds a touch of style, which is a small but appreciated detail.The masks are breathable, making them suitable for extended wear throughout the day. I have worn them for extended periods without experiencing discomfort or difficulty breathing.Moreover, the masks effectively provide protection from dust, pollutants, and airborne particles, making them ideal for both indoor and outdoor activities.While I am generally satisfied with the quality and performance of these disposable masks, I have occasionally noticed that a few masks in the pack may have loose ear loops or minor manufacturing defects. However, given the large quantity in the pack, this hasn't significantly impacted my overall experience.In conclusion, the 100 Pack Disposable Face Masks offer reliable and effective protection in a convenient package. Their comfortable fit, three-ply filter design, and black color make them suitable for various situations and environments.Though minor defects may occasionally be present in some masks, the value and convenience of this pack make it a solid choice for everyday use. Therefore, I give these disposable face masks a well-deserved four-star rating.",

So basically no protection at all. Also the slings for the ears is cheap and easily breaks when taking it off. I\u2019m a healthcare worker and thought I\u2019d have these at home for me and my kiddo but they were so cheap quality. Imagine 2 people went through 50 masks within 15 days.

The metal nose piece falls out of every single mask you use within seconds of putting the mask on.They are great to pop in and out of a store and then you throw it away. If you need a mask to wear for 30 minutes or longer this is not it as the nose piece will fall out and then the mask is more like a piece of material over your nose and mouth.Very light weight which is nice in the summer or in doors.",
