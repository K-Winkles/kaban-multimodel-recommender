They are lightweight, comfortable and very breathable. And they are individually wrapped! I've even handed some out before when people compliment, or just simply need one. The only very minor downside is if you have to wear the mask for a long period of time, the material seems to slightly breakdown on the nose area inside, causing it to get a little fuzzy, and make your nose itch a little. Not a big deal though. I've reordered these several times because I really do love them! :-)",

The only problem I've had is where the strap meets the mask corner. On a few of them, it's like the mask was melted when they attached the strap and after a few hours of wear (I work in a hospital pharmacy) it will come loose. But I will still give it an acceptable rating and will order again.",

                "reviewText": "I wear glasses and have a round face with a double chin. All other disposable facemasks would either irritate my face, hurt the bridge of my nose while wearing my glasses, the ear loops would hurt behind my ears (aching and digging) and constantly slipping up my face and into my eyes while I\u2019m talking, or grabbing things from lower shelves. They would not sit comfortably on my face and would also have fibers that constantly get in my mouth or in my nose and they just don\u2019t feel right.This on the other hand is the most comfortable disposable mask that I have ever worn. The loops for your ears are flat and they don\u2019t dig. It does not interfere with me wearing my glasses or headset for work. It is wide enough to fit my plumper face and comfortable with my double chin. This does not have excess fibers floating around, to get in to my nose or mouth.It is well constructed in my opinion. If you want a good disposable facemask, this is the one I would recommend. I can wear it all day if need be and be completely fine. No irritation to my face, no aches and pains for my ears, and not being blinded while working. I can easily carry several spares in my purse because of the individual plastic wrapping and not have to worry about it getting dirty before I can wear them. It is a good price point for the amount of masks that you receive for what you\u2019ve paid. And it\u2019s cheaper than what I saw in stores for the same amount by about $15-20.",
