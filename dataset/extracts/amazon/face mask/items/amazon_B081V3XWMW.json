Once on, it\u2019s immediately minty fresh and super soothing. It takes about 15-20 minutes for the mask to fully dry depending on how much and how thick you put it on. The peeling is super satisfying. It takes off oils and leaves my face feeling amazing. I\u2019d highly recommend this product.",

After 30 minutes, it was completely dry and I peeled the whole thing off in one piece. When I inspected it, I saw all of nasty and disgusting things that were clogging my pores... My conclusion is that it works exactly as described and I will be purchasing it again.",

So not true! This stuff is like tar. It\u2019s thick and incredibly messy.I had to apply it with my fingers since the applicator only held a drop on it. So my fingers were now covered in black. The stuff is sticky and don\u2019t touch anything or it will be covered for life.After following the instructions to the letter it was time to remove the mask. It hurt like hell when you pull it off and it made my chin red and breakout.",

                "reviewText": "I'm middle aged and have suffered from chronic rosacea since a teen. It's been hell. But I've managed to wrangle this terrible skin condition over the past few years by being vigilant with my prescribed topic medication and washing a minimum 2 times per day.I thought I'd give this a try since the price was right and I was looking for something to help decrease the size of the pores on and around my nose while eliminating the blackheads from the heaps of grease produced by my nasal glands.Mind you, I'm a man. I don't do face masks. This being my first time, I was extremely impressed. The consistency of this stuff isn't water. But it does have viscosity. However, with the included applicator, I only got a tiny smidge of excess black liquid on the countertop, which wiped/washed away easily.A little bit of this stuff goes a long way. My first mask I laid on quite thick, as there were some areas that didn't go on as smoothly and I wanted to fill in everything completely so that I could remove it in one solid piece. Only took 20 minutes to dry even in the thickest areas.Removal was a breeze. Just use your fingernail and pry up a corner, and it comes off in giant chunks. I don't think there's any way to remove it all perfectly in one piece. But it doesn't matter. Any small areas that remain on your face...simply wash with warm water and they'll fall right off. It's not rocket science.Oh, and removal is not painful at all. I have a lot of facial hair from my goatee and cheeks. I just avoided applying it to those areas. Focus on your T-zone if you're a male with facial hair and you'll be just fine.Took about 80 percent of my blackheads out on the first application. 90% after the second. Makes my skin feel very smooth and just ultra clean after it comes off. Then I finish it off with my rosacea medication, high quality moisturizer, and I'm all set.One can will last you forever. I've used it twice and barely put a dent into the product. Seriously, as long as you're not wasteful, this thing should probably last you a year if you apply it 2-3x a week.Good stuff!",
