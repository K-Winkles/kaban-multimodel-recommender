I've also worn them here and there a few times and i was surprised at how soft they are. The ear loops are comfortable and they don't pull too hard on my ears or make them sore after wearing the mask for several hours at work. I gave 4 stars because sometimes every now and then after wearing it a while little fibers would loosen and make me feel like i had a hair in my mask. Not all them did this and it was usually after hours of wear. Overall these are probably the most comfortable masks that I've tried and I will buy again.",

Breathing in them for extended periods of time do not make them become wet.The only thing is they are a little big but you can secure them better by looping the ear strings.Happy with my purchase\u2026",
