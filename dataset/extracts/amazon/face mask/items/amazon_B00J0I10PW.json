Its SUPER thin and is shipped in a plastic bag in a bubble mailer so any type of fold will crease it. The creases are super noticeable since its white. The tag for it was also stapled directly to the forehead so there are 2 small holes there now. You have to be really careful removing the stapleIm coating it in paper mache anyway so this doesnt really matter to me. But figured id mention it in a review incase someone just wants it as a plain white mask. If i wanted just the mask alone I wouldnt buy this",

He asked if we could find a mask for him to wear during his performance. He was so excited when this arrived because the small opening on the mouth allowed him to be able to sing with it on.He's only 11 so the mask was a bit big, but I expected that because it's made for an adult. It seems pretty sturdy too.....it's withstood being put on and taken off during several rehearsals plus his performance.",
