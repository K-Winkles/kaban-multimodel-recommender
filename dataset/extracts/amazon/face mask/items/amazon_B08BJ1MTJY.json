                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t write reviews cuz they\u2019re generally useless for many products, IMO, but I\u2019m so stoked on these masks, I just gotta\u2014I\u2019ve tried a million masks in the past year and have tirelessly researched to find one thats protective, comfortable, and doesn\u2019t irritate sensitive face skin and/or cause maskne. While there isn\u2019t any proven technology for maskne, the top derms are recommending anti microbial, soft, breathable cotton materials that don\u2019t work to cause excess \u201csweat\u201d or what I like to call \u201cbreath fog\u201d because that\u2019s when acne and other bacterium to form and then our face skin just marinate in grossness. It also has amazing ADDED bonuses: environmentally friendly materials, 25% more UV protection than other materials, it\u2019s comfortable AF, adjustable ear loops for many head/face sizes & preferences, reusable/machine washable, passes all CDC recommendations, looks cute AF, has a land yard for easy, convenient access, and best of all\u2014 it\u2019s the only mask I can comfortably wear my sun/eye glasses with.Also recommend this mask for those that need to wear them while working out, for any activity where you\u2019re hot, for long periods of time, for when you wanna look cute or professional but have to wear a mask, for days you\u2019re constantly having to put on mask/take off mask, and/or struggle with acne or other face skin issues.*PLS NOTE: these masks only come in TWO universal sizes; adult and kid. I think they\u2019ll fit comfortably for MOST, but not ALL. And obviously, NOTHING is universal, so the size + my above opinions are only mine. I will say, I\u2019ve made my entire family buy these and everyone loves them as well.",

                "reviewText": "This is a pretty, soft, stretchy, well-fitting face covering. The nose wire molds very well and the elastic for the ears is comfortable; the comfortable elastic neck strap keeps it from getting lost when you aren't wearing it. Those are the good attributes.The two knocks it has against it are that it is so thin, regardless of how many layers there are, it probably isn't a lifesaver. When in position, your first breath through your nose draws the fabric into your nostrils. It was impossible to take a breath without that happening. Fortunately, I have been using the silicone cages because that bothers so much anyway. With the cage, it is fine. So, if you just need a mask for compliance sake, this will do.",

                "reviewText": "This mask's description says the length from noise to chin is 15.16 cm or 5.97 in. The true measurement is 5.0 in. When VERY stretched it is 5.5 in. The point is the mask does not go under the chin AT ALL. It stops at the chin. Because it stops at the chin, it rides up as you wear it. This is supposed to be an adult size mask. My face is not large, nor do i have a double chin. There is NO excuse this mask shouldn't fit. DO NOT BUY THIS!! There is a no return policy on this purchase, that is why I closely checked the measurements given compared to measurements I took of my face. According to my measurement of my face, this mask should COMPLETELY cover my chin. Yes, the fabric is soft, but that doesn't matter if it doesn't fit. I am extremely disappointed and think Amazon should compensate me in some way.",

I bought it specifically because of the lanyard as I am going to Disney World and didn't want to have to keep putting a mask away for outdoors and finding it again for indoors. I tried the mask out around town before my trip and found it to work great. It is easy to slip on and off and it is soft so you don't notice it around your neck when you are not wearing it. It fits me very well and I would consider me an average size adult.Breathability seems fine, no better or worse than other masks I've had. The mask is a soft cloth material but I really didn't have any issues I've seen mentioned with it being pulled into my mouth when breathing hard.Overall, this is a great product for the price.",

                "reviewText": "This mask is great for a female or slender man's face, but I find it (a larger guy) to be too small. I do like the lanyard feature and the fit around the ears isn't bad but would have (after a long day of wearing one) benefitted from some ear protection from the constant rubbing. The fit was too tight for me, but my wife loved them.",

(So you end with 4 layers of material over the mouth) hardest mask to breath through I have ever used. Add on top you say washable and first wash all the metal bands in nose pop through the material. (I have other masks with metal and no issue at all) yes feels soft on face but that\u2019s about the nicest thing I could say. How did it get so many positive review?!",
