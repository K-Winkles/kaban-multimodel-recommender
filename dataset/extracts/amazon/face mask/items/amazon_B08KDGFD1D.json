                "reviewText": "I suggest to many people who look into reviews, there's not really many of these disposable masks that fit everyone's face :) You need to do your research a little bit and be creative a little more.With that said, these are fairly nimble masks. Filtering is probably very good, you can feel it is not very easily breathable. They would probably fit better if you have large or wide face/head. They are on the wide side of the spectrum, ear loops are fairly large as well, ain't help the situation.Built in wire by nose is kinda loose in fitting strength as well. So I use extra wire with adhesive on top of the one built-in to help tighten up the \"over the nose\" area, as well as tying up a nut on the loops to help make it a tighter fit. I'll attach the picture, I hope that helps.",

                "reviewText": "Edit (12/23/21): Removing 1 star from my original 4 stars, as I have to fix the ear loops to my ponytail, otherwise it really hurts the top of my ears after a couple of hours. Also, no matter how firmly I fix the mask against my face, it does not create a good seal, and my glasses fog up horribly.Original Review (11/25/21): Now that I'll be back working at the office, I've been trying a few different types of disposable masks to find the most comfortable to wear all day.These fit the bill nicely. I wore it on a 2 mile fast paced walk around the park to test it, and they were comfortable and easy to breath in even when I was huffing and puffing going up a steeper hill.In case someone is thinking about wearing them during exercise, be aware that it did create some condensation on the inside from hard breathing, which felt icky when my chin or lips touched the mask. But for wearing sitting at the office, they're perfect.I particularly like how they are individually wrapped. I can keep a few in the car or at my desk at work, and they won't get dirty or contaminated.My only complaint is that they are a little on the large side and fit loosely around the face. But the company provides you with a couple of plastic loops to pull them behind your head instead of ears, and that makes it fit snugly with a good seal.",
