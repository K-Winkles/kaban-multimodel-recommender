                "reviewText": "These masks are amazing. There\u2019s nothing better than on a hot, humid night throwing these on and chilling. Makes my skin feel amazing and the fabric is lovely.Only legit complaint is that they don\u2019t stay cold for long.. I find treat in 20 minutes I\u2019m flipping it over to the plastic side to get any effect. Then after 10 minutes of that it needs to go back into the freezer\u2026 but honestly that 30 minutes is lovely and I\u2019d still say these are worth your time.",
