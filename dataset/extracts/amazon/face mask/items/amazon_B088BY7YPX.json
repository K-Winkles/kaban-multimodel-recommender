                "reviewText": "These are my masks of choice. I work in healthcare with ample access to masks but prefer these ones for their strong straps, bendy wire at the top for a snug fit around the nose (some mask wires don't bend as well), and lack of pungent/plasticky artificial odor. They also fit well over N95 masks. Well worth the $10 every 2 months for me. I highly recommend for anyone who is comparing masks on here.They come in convenient plastic-wrapped 10-packs in a box of 50 (5 10packs). I always keep a 10-pack in my bag as backup if I forget to grab a mask as I am walking out of the house or if someone needs a spare mask.",

I took off one star because a couple of them (2 out of 50) of them had one of the ear loops break loose while I was wearing it. The first box I ordered did not have that problem and I did order a third box. But I now feel as though I must always carry a spare mask with me because our state mandates masks if you are out shopping or will be in the presence of other people.",

                "reviewText": "After trying a bunch of different masks I found this particular brand and type to be the best for the money. I tried a bunch of those fabric ones cuz they might look a little bit nicer but they're so hard to breathe through and when you start talking it pulls off your nose. But these regular masks are very lightweight, easy to breathe through and the loops that go around your ears are stretchy and soft. The masks seem to be sewn very well and the quality has been consistent. I'm on my third box. Perhaps most important is these masks have a metal nose strip...NOT plastic... So it allows us people that have to wear glasses to be able to get a good seal around our nose.",

                "reviewText": "Aaron Collins tested the filtration efficiency of these surgical masks and they clock in at 93.7% as worn on the face. Much much much better than even the best cloth masks, so please stop wearing garbage cloth masks! While these Zubrex masks are comfortable, they do not create a good seal to the face since they are a surgical mask. This is not the fault of the mask, but consumers should know these are more for source control rather than preventing inhalation of COVID aerosol. I would only rely on using these masks to prevent COVID if I was desperate or perhaps they would work to keep roommates safe when living with a COVID-positive patient while the infected person is sleeping due to the Zubrex's low pressure drop. Sleeping in a genuine N95 masks sucks, trust me, I've tried it. Nevertheless, I wouldn't know much about having COVID since I've ballerly dodged COVID for its entire existence due to religious use of high quality masks!For real protection in the wild, I would recommend upgrading to a standards-rated respirator such as a good KF94, FFP2/FFP3, N95/P95/N100/P100. Personally, I double-mask these bad boys to keep dirt and germs off of my genuine N95 respirator when I'm in a dirty location, but wouldn't be caught dead nakedly rocking a Zubrex without a proper N95 underneath. Also kinda salty that the price dropped after Americans threw in the towel regarding COVID in Spring 2021, but there was a genuine shortage of meltblown material at the time, so I'll let is slide this time.For suggestions on better masks to prevent COVID while also keeping breathability high, check out Aaron Collins' YouTube channel.Wear a GOOD mask, blast COVID dead into the past!",

There is good coverage from the bridge of the nose to under the chin. Breathing is easy, as is conversing. Although the masks are strong, to ensure protection, we never wear a mask more than one day. For added protection, we always wear any mask(we have tried several cloth types which must be laundered between wearing and, therefore, efficacy may break down over time and several \u2018surgical\u2019 style masks) combined with a face shield.Due to comfort, fit, breathable, and 3 layer, we prefer this Zubrex mask.The material is 65% non-woven, 35% meltblown.",

                "reviewText": "My parents have been paying quite a bit for face masks at their local pharmacy, and disposable ones are the only kind my disabled brother can really tolerate. We decided to try these, as they were much cheaper than the pharmacy, and everything has been good so far. They are fitting all members of my family, including my brother, nicely. My mom has a smaller face than my dad, and my brother has a larger face than my dad, and they work for all three of them. I tried one as well, and have no complaints. My mom even noted that they don't fog up her glasses as bad as one she was given by a hospital (she forgot to bring one of her own one day), which is good for both my parents, since they wear glasses, and I wear sunglasses while out! Overall, these are just as good if not better than the ones at the pharmacy, and the whole family is comfortable wearing them all day if need be. Highly recommended!",
