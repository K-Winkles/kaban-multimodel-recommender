                "reviewText": "These masks are WONDERFUL, definitely my favorite! As a college student I have to wear a mask for hours, talk, and sit through lectures. These are the best I\u2019ve found and I have tried A TON to find ones that check off all of the boxes of comfort.Pros:\u2022Great fit overall, can wear for hours at a time and rarely have to adjust!!\u2022Comfortable ear straps!!! No sore ears here!! This is a must, especially when you have to wear a mask for long periods. These straps are made of the same black fabric on the rest of the mask, they\u2019re not elastic. They are not overly thick or thin and do not pull my ears at all! These are the ONLY ones I have found where the straps are not too loose or too tight (a bit loose before wash/drying, but don\u2019t fall off)\u2022Super soft! These would probably be a great choice with those who have sensory issues! I have allodynia (a type of nerve pain, so I\u2019m sensitive to textures) I\u2019ve had a ton on masks that are rougher fabrics and they tend to bother me. With these I usually forget I\u2019m wearing them.\u2022Glasses friendly! Adjustable nose piece is flat metal strip (rather than those crappy bread tie type ones) and I\u2019ve been washing/wearing these for months and the metal hasn\u2019t broken! Helps keep my glasses from fogging and keeps the mask over my nose. (Pro tip, try washing your lenses gently with Dawn dish soap or shaving cream, it can help with fogging too!)\u2022 Machine Washable! I have a smaller face (which makes finding masks annoying, some kids sizes are too small and adult sizes are huge) and after a couple washes (I just throw them in the washer then dryer in a wash bag to protect them) they fit perfectly!! If you don\u2019t have a small face I would recommend air drying them.\u2022 The heart is similar to vinyl, so it\u2019s not red fabric or sewn on, but I have had ZERO issues with it peeling off even after multiple washes!!\u2022Simple, but cute! Can be worn at any occasion!\u2022I\u2019m not overly picky about breathability, but I\u2019d say these are the perfect \u201cnot too thick, not too thin\u201d masks. They don\u2019t suction to your face when you inhale and exhaling doesn\u2019t feel like your trying to breathe through a pillow.Cons:\u2022These may be too snug for some adults, I\u2019d measure a mask that fits you if that\u2019s a concern.\u2022The ear straps aren\u2019t adjustable, but with the nose piece and fit I haven\u2019t had an issue with that, especially after washing/drying.\u2022Not sure if this would be a con for anyone, the inside of the mask is white, but it is sewn where the black fabric folds to the inside a bit so it is not visible at all when wearing.",

                "reviewText": "Bought only to wear on job, I usually don't wear one with the exception of a Drs. Office or a place with super strict policy. I usually wear disposable ones but bought these since I knew I'd need it often. Other reviews complained about getting ones that didn't have the nose bridge type but I got the ones advertised.It's comfortable as far as being over the ears and wide enough to cover whole face. My personal complaint is it's such thick material that it causes me to sweat into the mask and my nose run. If I had to compare it to something I'd say it's like breathing under covers. I found it hard to breath at times while running around working and had to walk off so I could pull it down to breath.Based off quality and purpose of say it's a decent buy. For those accustomed to wearing mask, my issues may not be your issue. I still plan to wear it in the hopes it will improve with use and I don't regret buying. They are really cute, would be cuter if it was a tiny owl in the corner but I also enjoy the simple hearts. Decent buy.",
