                "reviewText": "I like FaceTory's sheet masks - they're affordable and they work well. This one is a black sheet mask, somewhat thick, and because of the thickness, is quite easy to place on the face. I've found the thinner ones to slip and slide, and just takes extra effort to wrangle it on your face. I wasn't sure which side I had to use facing my skin as that information wasn't available on the packaging. I assumed the side with the lines (graphene technology) is facing outwards, and once I looked on this page I realized that is the correct way of using these. The sheet is soaked in serum although there is no extra serum in the packet for you to slather on your neck. I think how quickly these masks dry on your skin also depends on the weather, as mine took over 20 minutes and I actually removed them before it even came close to drying up. My skin felt very moisturized and still soaked in serum. It does feel slightly sticky but I was heading to bed anyways so I didn't mind. I also did notice the brightening, although it could be the dewy glow of the serum on my face. Overall I did like these masks and think they are good value. They seem to work just as well as any other sheet masks, if not better than some of the ones I've tried.",

                "reviewText": "I am familiar with this brand because of their acne patches. They're my favorite ones around and the face mask is just as good. Having acne prone skin I went for the calming one with acne treating ingredients. It's been great. I can use it without worry of a break out and my skin feels very nice afterward. I try to use a mask like this about once a week in combination with a mud mask and my daily skin care routine. I've found since starting a full routine I feel and look a lot better.",
