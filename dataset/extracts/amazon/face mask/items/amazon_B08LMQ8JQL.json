I have other neck and face gators I bought and got for free from work but these are by far the most comfortable and cool to use in hot fishing weather or outdoor work when you wish to avoid all threat of sun burn. In that capacity the work superbly well. They are just tight enough to remain in place but loose enough to feel comfortable and not like they are trying to choke you out.If your a big guy and looking for a sung fitting but very comfortable neck gator to protect you from sunburn and dust this is the neck gator for you.",
