I use one of these about once every two weeks in place of one of my daily sheet masks for an extra boost of moisturizing. The serum tingles my skin only SLIGHTLY for the first two minutes or so of the mask being applied to my face, but it's definitely not painful or unmanageable considering the positives it has on my skins dryness. If you have REALLY sensitive skin I wouldn't recommend this product, but if you have moderately sensitive to \"normal\" skin it's a decent mask.",

I was wanting to purchase a paper face mask covered in cream that goes on your face and is left on there for a period of time and then disposed of. I got several packs of cream. I can buy face cream in a bottle. I don't need to pay $2/each for little sample packets of cream!!With all that being said, the cream is nice and smells good. Just not what you might be thinking of...",

I originally got these masks to use as a spot treatment, but I loved the way they felt so much that now I use them nightly! The formula is lightweight and never makes my face feel greasy, but still so hydrating that my face feels moisturized even if I\u2019m peeling after a sunburn. There is a light fragrance, but so do most moisturizers I\u2019ve tried, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. I highly recommend this product!",
