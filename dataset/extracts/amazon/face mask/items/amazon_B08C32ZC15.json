                "reviewText": "I purchased this and several other neck-gaiter or handkerchief style masks looking for a good mask for hiking during coronavirus. I have heavier multi-layer fabric masks which fit tight with filter pockets for times when I want to provide myself some inhalation protection from others, but those masks are not appropriate for heavy exertion. So for hiking I just wanted something that would reasonably provide the protection to others from my own exhaled droplets when conditions force us to pass by close together. Several of the masks I ordered could not pass this simple test and were such thin fabric that I really couldn't in good conscious consider them valid masks for the purpose. This one, however, while lightweight and breathable, I felt was heavyweight enough to serve this purpose. It is roughly swimsuit material. When I have it stretched over my eyes, I can see through it, but only just barely. The material is stretchy, but a tight stretch and tightly knitted. You can see how it fits in the pictures.Pros: - The tube of the gaiter is very long, you can see in my pictures that it easily stretches over my entire face/head with fabric to spare. This means it is very versitile, if you wanted to wear it over your entire head so only your eyes would show, there is material to do that and still cover your neck. - I really like the elastic that lets you tighten the gaiter when its up over your nose. This I felt was a must for hiking when you are exerting yourself, possibly with hands busy on a pole or balancing yourself and you don't want to be constantly pulling the mask back up. - It sits loosely around your neck ready for when you need it, so when hiking you can easily just pull it up if someone else comes near - Pattern is pretty and vibrant - Well-made - no loose threads, looks like it will last well - Size - I am overweight and so don't have a tiny neck, but the tube when around my neck is loose and not tight, yet tight enough that it fits snug when I pull up over my faceCons (these are very nitpicky cons, but I list them anyway if it matters to you) - When I tighten the elastic and then pull the gaiter down, the elastic IS tight on my neck. Someone thinner might not have this problem, but it does mean I will have to loosen and tighten it each time I pull it on or off. Not a manufacturing defect, mostly just a factor of my neck size and the stylePotential Improvements - No idea if manufacturers actually look at reviews for ideas, but I would love basically this gaiter with a pocket in front of the mouth area, providing slightly more protection (2 layers instead of one) and the ability to add a filter if desired. There were some that had this feature, but I don't think I could find one that had that and the elastic to secure the gaiter around your face.Overall, I was very happy with the quality and fit and ordered 3 more for the rest of my family.",

                "reviewText": "What really differentiates this neck gaiter is the drawstring at the back with a metal tab to keep the bit you pulled snugly in place without slipping. (Slippage was a major concern since I'm definitely on the smaller side.) Because of this little bit of engineering, you can pull the front up over your nose in mouth while keeping the rest at the back of your neck, instead of having to pull the whole thing halfway up your head and ears to keep it in place. This also allows the front to not be pulled tightly up against your face and mouth, instead giving it enough room for the fabric to drape and blouse loosely and comfortably while still staying secure above your nose. This space also helps reduce the amount of particles you're going to breathe in through the fabric, if that is what you are using this accessory for.Personally I am using this accessory as something I can easily pull up while working, walking, or biking outdoors to protect against wind, pollen, sun, dirt, or grass and weed trimmings. So far it works great. It feels cooler in hot weather, and warms your neck and face up in colder weather.When not \"in use\", it drapes around your neck loosely with a good bit of material at the front, very much like an old school bandana or neck scarf -- it doesn't wad up tightly like many neck gaiters do. It gives any outfit a very \"outdoorsy\" look.Incidentally I also tried wearing the garment on my head, like a headscarf. It will indeed give you a bit of a \"pirate\" look (and maybe you'd like to put a band on the long trailing end like the pirates did) but is very comfortable, good at keeping your hair out of the way, and the silky fabric actually does cool your hair/top of the head a little bit. (Here in Texas that is an extremely important point.)If you are looking for a really functional neck gaiter, this is the brand that I would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for a trip i took to replace the typical, blue masks I\u2019ve been wearing due to Covid. I needed to have a mask on for 5+ hours. Because it hangs from the bottom of your face, I found it easier to breathe in. It\u2019s not easy, but easier. It\u2019s a thinner material, so if you\u2019re immune compromised, I wouldn\u2019t count on it safeguarding you. It was super easy to pull up & down throughout the day as opposed to the blue masks that you have to continuously take off & on. This one you just pull it up & pull it down around your neck. It\u2019s a little tight to pull over your head to put it on, so be mindful of your hair! It also has an adjustable elastic band so you can customize the size. That worked very well. The only negative I have is that the piece of elastic seen inside (to keep it up & for adjustment), is a round piece of elastic, like a hose. After wearing it a number of hours, I developed a very sensitive spot on my nose. If they would have used a flat piece of elastic, I think it would\u2019ve been much more comfortable. I\u2019ve been wearing it now for regular life, in & out of stores, for a month now. I would buy it again. Oh ya, the designs are very nice.",

                "reviewText": "I got this gaiter as an alternative to a medical face mask to wear to the airport and on a flight. its a very slippery, silky fabric much like a satin pillowcase and doesn't offer much breathability. One end has a drawstring cord with toggle to keep it tight, the other is loose. I got the night sky print. It's cute and very well constructed though. It's better suited as a lightweight alternative to a neck scarf, I've used it for that purpose for outdoor activities and it keeps the wind out fine. If you're wanting to wear it as a face covering you'd have to use the drawstring end otherwise it falls down your face",
