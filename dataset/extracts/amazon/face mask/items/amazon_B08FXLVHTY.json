I can use the pink ones. The price is good too.These smell like the masks hospitals and clinics provide. There isn't a strong chemical smell.I'll definitely order these again.",

They have reusable ones but they are not as lightweight/ breathable as these are so I'd rather them wear these to school. I love them. We like the different colors and the metal inside to pinch at the nose. They are also lightweight and breathable. For my toddlers I do tie the ends because they are a little too big but not by much. Also don't let your kiddos just hurry and grab it out the box or it may rip a tie/loop .. this also should be an easy fix though if u just tie it back through the hole in the mask for it. I definitely will continue buying more.",

She doesn\u2019t complain about them and I don\u2019t mind doing it. I see a lot of complaints about it but it\u2019s no big deal for me or my daughter. For the price and the fact that she uses a new one each day for school I\u2019ll deal with it!",
