I have piercings all over my ears and specifically the industrial piercing on my right side gets pushed into my head while wearing this, causing me to have to pull the fabric away and readjust. Besides that the quality of the material is a great mesh style and it deflects winds very well.",

Secondly, it was great for cold nights, as even if I didn't want to wear it to strike fear into my opponent's hearts, it did help keep my head warm which helped make the games more playable in the winter weather. While I didn't actually use it to go skiing, I was very happy with the product I got and would totally recommend it!",
