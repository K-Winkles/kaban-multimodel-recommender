While it's still too early to tell if it will help fade them, my face feels AMAZING after the mask and the serum. I do not, however, like the little spatula. It's too much trouble, I just use my hands. It does kind of hurt when you peel it off, but no more than that black charcoal peel off mask. I do feel it's a little more difficult to apply than other masks I've used, It's a slightly thicker consistency. I've been trying to find a new night cream, and the serum has been working amazingly for my sensitive skin. No redness, itch, or irritation! Just a nice fresh face. I'm also in Arizona, so my skin is constantly dry. But since I've been using this product, I wake up to a nicely moisturized face. I had looked at many different products before I purchased this, and I'm super happy I went with this one!",

                "reviewText": "This mask seems great but it is very messy. Why must it have came in a pot and not a squeeze bottle? Unless you put a good layer on, it does not peel. And then unless you are going to lay down SECONDS after you put it on, it'll start dripping off your face; I had it on now for 10 minutes and it's still dripping It is very hard to clean up, I needed to use dish soap. I've had it on for close to an hour now I barely any of it is dry, it wouldn't peel so I had to use dish soap ON MY FACE to try and get the wet spots off. This whole thing took probably 2 whole hours. NEVER AGAIN",
