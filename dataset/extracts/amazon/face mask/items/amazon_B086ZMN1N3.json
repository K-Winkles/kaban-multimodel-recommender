I've only found a couple of downsides. First, when handwashing them initially a LOT of dye came out. I was worried that the mask would leave dye on my face, but this isn't the case. Just give them a good wash before using. Second, they don't have wire so they aren't snug around the nose. I can't wear my glasses with fogging them up. It also means that air is technically going in and out of the mask without being filtered. This is not a concern for me and I would definitely buy more. I'm very happy with this purchase.",

The straps around the ears would be too loose.The masks are comfortable and very breathable. I washed them by hand before wearing and some black dye ran out so they aren't color fast. They are labeled machine washable but I'd stick to hand wash and air dry, personally.The fabric is single layer and you can see light through it but not too much. I do wish they had nose wires because they aren't sufficiently snug around the nose but they do cup under the chin well. Lowest price I've seen and made in Guatemala, not China, for once.",

The stretchy elastic that pulls the mask over your face, loops over your ears and for those individuals who have longer hair, they need not worry because the elastic is material covered and doesn't tangle up. They remind me of T-shirt material and I can honestly say I will be buying another pack of these because I really like that they're thicker than the cheesy paper ones but not overly so as to be uncomfortable.",

                "reviewText": "There is a mask mandate for the City of Ottawa, requiring us to wear masks at all times in stores, shopping centers, businesses, etc...To that end, having on hand a supply of reusable masks is a necessity. My wife and I share vehicles, and we keep masks in each, as well as in coat pockets etc...These masks proved to be comfortable, very breathable, and with a good price point. Delivery was fast. There are no adjustments on the ear loops, but the material is forgiving and the mask sits comfortably without pulling on my ears. They may not fit all sizes of adults, as the lack of adjustment, but they fit my (big) head.I would certainly buy them again, if I need more. The value is good. The product is good. People are becoming somewhat mask connoisseurs so I will highlight the following if you have preferences:No wire for the nose - but IMO material is soft enough that the wire is unnecessaryNo sewn box for the chin - again soft material makes up for thisNo adjustment stoppers for the ear loops - not an issue for meLight fabricNo pouch for carbon filters - results in lights mask",

I have a normal man head, with a giant nose, this thing keeps falling off my nose. there is usually a little extra bit which hangs off my chin area as well. just use a paper bag. the plastic this thing came in would have made for a better mask.",

First order I made was perfect in terms of fit, so I immediately made a second order but this batch was was way too big and slid down my face most of the time, making them pretty useless. In all fairness to them most likely being manufactured by hand I can understand the difficulty in being consistent with size. Nonetheless, this is just a buyer beware, if you manage to luck out with your order, you'll be satisfied.",
