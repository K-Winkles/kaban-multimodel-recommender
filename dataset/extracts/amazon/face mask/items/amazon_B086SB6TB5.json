                "reviewText": "The quality seems fine, but they are small and get smaller when laundered. Due to the reusable nature of this item, the ability to be washed and dried is important. Even after the two I tested in the laundry shrank an estimated less than 10%, they no longer fit me, an adult average sized male, but fit my 13 year old daughter even better than their original size. At the original size it was a passable but tight fit for me, after unusable. I will update the review as my child continues to wear the mask and the durability of the item can be assessed, but at first inspection, I am happy with the construction. The original intention was to dye these a unique color for each of the family members, I see no reason why they won't hold dye, but that too will be mentioned in a future review edit.",

Fits snug to the face for an adult, for a child will be too big unless you tighten the ear loops. Now, the ear loops... UGH. They are not stretchy skinny elastic loops which would be much more comfortable and not drag your ears. The loops are the same fabric as the mask and thick. They are just big enough to fit around your ears (barely and I have small ears), but they pull on your ears something awful and I cannot fathom wearing these for an 8 hour day at work. Change the ear loops and I could give these another star...",

I knew if they were to small for me they would fit the kids. In my opinion mine is a perfect fit, but they were slightly big in the kids. (Ages in picture range from 8-14) We will be buying them again since they were super fun to make and are good quality. I will probably try the kids in the dryer to see if we can shrink them just a bit.",

                "reviewText": "Review Update: Unfortunately I did not date my previous review. I have downgraded to one star. I washed the mask, in COLD, and then it didn't fit any more. So I am literally going to get ONE USE out of these masks. COMPLETE waste of money! I make knit hats. I have charts. A 22 inch head is right in the middle of average, slightly large for a woman and slightly small for a man. Adding the 2 inches for the nose is also average. There is NO reason these masks should have been made as small as they are. VERY disappointed.My head is 24 inches around when I include my ears and my nose. These masks /barely/ fit me, and since they are made of cotton, I am guessing the won't fit after I wash them. The earloops are not made of elastic. The ear loops barely stretch. I had to cram my ears into them. So measure your head before you order these. I would say these are for a head/ears/nose 23 inches or less.",

I'm not sure why, or if it's safe, to have these metals in there. I was really just looking for a cotton mask with good airflow, which this isn't really as it is quite thick - at least two layers of cotton plus mystery stuff inside. Though I have heard that silver kills viruses so maybe they are going for that effect. I have not yet decided if this surprise is a plus or a minus, but it should be properly listed on the description! It fits a bit tight, but workable.",
