This is great because it means it actually works and deeply cleanses as it states. This does smell like peppermint so if that's going to bother you, I wouldn't recommend this.I do have mild eczema on my cheeks. When I use this product, I do notice a slight burning sensation on my cheeks that lasts for only a few seconds then goes away. It's nothing to cause me great concern & I will continue to use this product despite that. There is a warning on the container that says it might cause a slight tingly sensation. However, I only notice the irritation on my cheeks where the eczema is. I don't feel tingly sensations on my forehead, nose, or chin when I apply it.I will continue to use this product once a month & highly recommend it! I will update once I've finished the container to see if my opinion has changed. It might be awhile before I do that though because it doesn't take a lot of product to do a mask once a month. It's definitely a great value for the price and amount of product provided!",

They are not bad but are too thick which makes it hard to apply and rinse them off.They do a good job of cleansing the pores, like every other clay mask I've tried. They have aloe, glycerin and almond oil so they don't dry out the skin, which is great. But because of the thickness of the product, I will not repurchase it.",

Also, the purple colour stains everything purple, so make sure your don\u2019t get it on white clothings.",
