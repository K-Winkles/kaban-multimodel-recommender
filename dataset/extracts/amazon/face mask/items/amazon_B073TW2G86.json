                "reviewText": "The last one I needed of these was $8 alone for just one. This is good bang for your buck and very stylish. Also helps me smile in public by doing so for me. Have not wash it yet in a washer/dryer. However this is the replacement for the last one of these I got (just slightly different) so maybe the teeth will chip away ever so little. Not sure, if it does through all 4 somehow. A small $10 won't be so bad for the masks pack again. They're so nicely madeBut buying these again is not a real issue since they feel amazing. Like genuinely easy to breathe and a lot better than my last one of these which was white cotton padding on the inside. Also do note these masks shipped incredibly fast. Perfect because I wanted to have one again to go to work wearing. (Took 4 days total. Technically 3 bc of timing)Glasses owners like me. You'll be fine. I tested em myself. There will be a little fog from your breathing but overall not much. These are much much better and I barely had to fiddle with it being on my face to not fog em upHighly reccomend over any other ones. Make sure to style yourself around the mask itself.",

                "reviewText": "Extremely soft and comfortable. Im a man in my mid-20s and it fits just right on my face though the straps tug at my ears, but not in a way where it hurts. Maybe it's because of this as well that it is so snug that when I try to talk while wearing it, my speech comes out pretty muffled. Though I don't know at the moment if it's because it's brand new.My one and only real issue is that the thumbnail makes the designs appear larger than they actually are. The smiles don't stretch across the width of the mask; they sit right in the middle of it and theyre about 1.5x larger than my real mouth. Both sides are black, so i suppose you could reverse it, but id imagine the design would feel uncomfortable pressing against your mouth.Other than that, I'd highly recommend it for people who want a comfortable reusable face mask for when they step out of their house.",

                "reviewText": "When my 13 year old son went back to brick and mortar school, he needed masks. I originally bought these because they looked cooler than the plain solid color masks that we had been wearing. He loves them and other kids have asked him where he got them.Beyond them looking cool, they hold up well; I wash his masks after every time he wears them. After about ten washes, they have not faded at all. I don't want to say they shrink, lets call it tightening up, they went from fitting loosely to being just right. For reference, my 13 year old is 5' 11\" and about 160lbs. I have also used the masks in a pinch (Not exactly my style) I am 6' 2\" and 190 lbs. These masks fit me as well.",
