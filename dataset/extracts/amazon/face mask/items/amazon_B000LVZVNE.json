It's very cheap, it WILL protect you from the cold, the coldest I have tried it was around 20F, not sure about colder weather or in Celsius. I do wear glasses, and sometimes, the mask does feel uncomfortable. However, I rather feel little bit uncomfortable than being very cold.Here are my pro's and con's.Pro's:- CHEAP and DURABLE- VALUE FOR YOUR BUCK - KEEPS YOUR FACE WARM DURING THE WINDY/COLD weather- IT CAN BE ADJUSTED TO YOUR FACE LENGTH ON THE BACK- THE DESIGN FITS MY FACE VERY GOOD, but can be some discomfort at some times.CONS- Only the discomfort at some times.",

                "reviewText": "I modified mine, the nosehole was not wide enough and i cut it further, and it works fine. I wear glasses and some of the exhaled hot air from my nose goes up and fogs my glasses and this is sort of an issue that I wish didn't exist.I wear a lot of gear on my face and the area that runs across the top is trimmed, and it contacts the upper bridge of my nose and does apply a little bit of pressure (the pressure is aided by my large protective/proscription eye wear and other gear) and it gets a bit uncomfortable/painful for a full days work.Thankfully the mask itself does very well with the moisture that i breath out. The mask does not get cold on my skin in sub zero degrees Fahrenheit, though note that if you wear this over a balaclava or any type of cloth, even if that cloth is down at your chin and not in proximity of your nose or mouth, the cloth will collect moisture, resulting in a cold face upon removing the mask.Wearing this item under everything, or over everything, both have advantages and disadvantages, but overall I will continue to use this product unless I stumble across something that can do what it does and better.",

The fact that the company has a return policy that let's you know, you will only get back half of what you paid, should've been a clue that they deal with a lot of returns.

                "reviewText": "This product wraps around your head from the base of your skull, at your hairline at the back of your head, across your nose. The circumference of this mask, with the Velcro completely overlapping, is only 17.5 inches. The Velcro extends 2.5 inches. The circumference of my head from my nose to the back of neck at the hairline is 20 inches. I wear a hat size of 7.5 for my head. I can wear this thing, but only using 1/2 inch of the Velcro, and it is eating into my face. I would only purchase this mask for young children or adults with small head sizes. Better yet, purchase a face mask that includes Turtle Fur and some elasticity. They will be much more comfortable.",
