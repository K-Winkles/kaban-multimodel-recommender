I was surprised that the mask really is cold when applied (I thought that was just my house, but it seems like the mask is genuinely like this). The smell is very pleasant - it has a very subtle scent of coconut but it isn\u2019t overwhelming.Application was super easy compared to other sheet masks I\u2019ve used in the past. With other sheet masks, sometimes you have to do a complicated dance of figuring out how to even fit it on your face. This one - you just unfold it and it\u2019s basically ready to go. They make it as simple as it should be.Overall, I\u2019ve been turned into a fan and will be repurchasing.",
