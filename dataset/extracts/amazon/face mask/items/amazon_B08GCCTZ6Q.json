                "reviewText": "I've spent a good amount of time riding the motorcycle in 20's and 30's with this thing on. Was it cold? Yes. Was my neck cold? No. My neck stayed very warm despite the temperatures. There was only one time when the cold outside started to bite in a little bit, and the windchill being well below zero was a good reason for that. I put a full lined fleece one over it, since it is much thinner than you expect and it kept all the air out and was fine after. Wash it regularly though. I had noticed it stretches out a slight bit around my face when I leave it unwashed for a few a week or so, but it does snug back up when you get it back out of the dryer. It is modular, and the cap design doesn't get into my face putting my helmet on, and it's nice to be able to pull the face mask down when I don't really need it. The mesh on the front is nice to be able to breath through, and typically doesn't fog my windshield unless I leave the vents closed. Over all, I highly recommend it for winter rides, or to take for skiing or whatever ever other winter fun you like.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for when I ride my motorcycle when it's cold. It's overall a decent product, especially for the price.It has a very soft lining on the inside, great for taking it easy on the face's skin. It fits very snugly thanks to the spandex. My helmet doesn't fog up anyways because of my pinlock system, but I could see it being very effective for fog. I love the fact that you can independently move around the top and bottom layer. Thanks to this you can make it cover the maximum amount of skin, and don't have to worry about openings being created because you bunch the fabric together like with other products. It can be a beanie and neck warmer or a balaclava. Pretty awesome design with respective to that aspect.I do have a few issues though, which is why I'm not giving it 5 stars. For one, it's not really thick enough/insulated enough to keep warm in the cold, especially going 65 mph. Now, to be fair, that's probably not what they were intending on it to do.My other issue is that nose piece that comes out across the bridge. I get it's for preventing fog and all that, but it just drives me insane. Any time I pull the bottom layer down to get it right on my face, this little piece of fabric is pulled out. And if you want the mask to cover as much of your face as possible, then you can't use that nose part because it gets in the way of your vision. This is pretty minor, but still something.My last issue, again a minor one, I wish they had made the piece that goes over the bridge adjustable or make it a much tighter fit. It just doesn't quite cover the bending of the nose perfectly.But the ABSOLUTE best thing about this product??? Since I can move the upper and lower pieces independently, I can FINALLY bring out my inner ninja..... Fear me....",

Chin portion can be lowered to jaw level without being uncomfortable to prevent visor fog up and allow com use. Interior is soft brushed material of some sort, feels and looks great.",
