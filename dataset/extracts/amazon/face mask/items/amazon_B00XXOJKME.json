I also noticed after the first and second time that some clogged pores came to the surface in a way that made it easy to extract without my face breaking out horribly too. So it seems to cleanse the skin as it is working as well. I put some in my fridge to add a cooling effect, highly recommend!",

I rubbed the extra serum on my neck and chest and I left the mask on for about 30 mins. When I took off the sheet, I massaged the remaining serum into my skin and went to sleep. When I woke up the next morning and washed it off, my skin looked AMAZING. My face was bright, toned and clear and my pores were closed. This is my third purchase because I really love it and I'll continue buying it.",

Whenever I'm feeling dried out, I just pop one of these on and feel so much better 20 minutes later-- cool, soothing and hydrating. I've tried some other sheet masks which died out like paper mache within 10 minutes due to the low humidity in my home state, but these stay damp for 20 minutes (probably longer, but I never keep them on longer). I think the sheet is made of higher quality material than masks I've tried before and does not allow for much evaporation between the sheet and skin. These appear to be legit Korean masks as most the packaging is in Korean and the masks fit my face a little awkwardly like the masks I bought in Korea-- So, I think they're the real deal! None of that knock off junk.",
