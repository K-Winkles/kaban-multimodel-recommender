The masks are very comfortable and breathable, and they have a nose clip that helps to seal the mask around the nose. The ear loops are also adjustable and do not hurt my ears after wearing them for a long time. The masks are individually wrapped which is very convenient and hygienic. They are made of five layers of non-woven fabric and have a filtration efficiency of 95% or higher. I have used these masks for grocery shopping, going to the doctor, and visiting some friends, and I feel very safe and confident wearing them.",

Usually I like to use my cute mask with a filter installed and then a plastic thing that keeps the mask from closing on my lipstick or bumping while I talk, which is a lot but I still have filters for them. These are great, easy to adjust, seems to close/able to adjust on my nose, doesn\u2019t interfere with my glasses, doesn\u2019t mess with my lipstick/gloss, or while talking (so far, haven\u2019t done a whole 8 hour day), feels comfortable on my ears and face, and doesn\u2019t look weird with the center fold. Honestly thought I would still need the plastic thing I got to keep my lipstick/talking protected, especially since these fold so compactly to fit into luggage/a pouch under my car seat, but no these are a one and done option.",

The earloops are also adjustable for a tighter fit. & It's waay more breathable than my previous quick trip mask, a cloth over surgical mask. The black color, of course, goes with everything.",

                "reviewText": "With all the people sick this winter It makes sense to mask up when in crowded indoor settings. These adjustable face masks are comfortable come with a cushioned nose bridge rest and an adjustable strap give you greater granularity to secure the mask to your face and seal up any air leaks along the perimeter. So you no longer have to knot up the straps to secure the mask to your face. The adjustable metal nose grip is malleable and easy to wrap around the bridge of the nose and the inner portion is foam cushioned. I recently wore it at a holiday party for several hours. and it was comfortable, so I am highly recommending these KN95 face masks. Each of the 30 masks are individually packed in a plastic sleeve and separate making it more hygienic for distribution or for self-retrieval.",

                "reviewText": "The Semask KN95 Adjustable Masks 30 Pack is so handy. Each mask is folded flat and individually packaged, making it perfect to toss into pocket, purse, glove compartment, briefcase, anywhere. The masks themselves are flexible and easy to adjust to fit. The nose piece is soft, malleable, and comfortable. The ear straps are a very soft elastic fabric that has a clip at the loop which makes it easy to adjust the fit from upper or lower sections. For example, if you want a bit closer more shaped fit to the chin you draw the lower portion further through the clip until you find comfortable placement. Across the cheekbones you would adjust the top of the ear loop to tighten or ease the fit. The mask fabric is soft, easy to breathe through and speak behind. These shaped masks are not the least bit bulky in fit or appearance. I highly recommend the Semask KN95 Adjustable Masks.",

Just I've never had a single item thru Prime that I wasn't able to return. NOT all at happy.",
