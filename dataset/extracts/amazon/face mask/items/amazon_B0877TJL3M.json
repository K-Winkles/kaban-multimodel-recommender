But this actually works really well for household members that wear glasses as it really helps to keep them from fogging up.Mask quality is good and the material did not have an odor like some others I have tried. They feel very thin but this is expected of this type of material. Like all other disposable masks, the bands are glued on so it is always a good idea to treat them carefully. Excessive pulling or stretching can cause the glued area to rip away from the mask.",

We are all being lied to. Initially, Fauci came out and told the truth about them, recommended that we don't even bother with them, but he was shut up by politicians. This paper mask mght stop some dust in the air, but it's totally ineffective in a Pandemic for stopping pathogenic viruses. Ask any medical worker, they'll tell you. If it's not an N-95 Surgical Mask, you're wasting your money. And exposing yourself to Covid Of course nobody will publicize this information because Surgical grade masks are made in China, and they're NOT sharing them. The limited supply that does make it into our country are immediately scarfed up for hospital employees and first responders. You can't even find the real ones online anymore! BUT, I still purchased them because it shuts up the uninformed who INSIST we use a mask. This is the biggest lie, the biggest scam ever perpetuated on the American public. It's designed to give you some sense of control, security and hope. If they worked, why is Covid still rampant out there? Why did the religious paper mask wearers still get sick? (It's because they DON'T work to stop virus. Plain and simple.} Thanks though, for the low price. At least I can get my shopping done if I have one of these shams strapped to my beak.",

The nose fitting is excellent ( do not fog your glasses) and the fabric feels heavy duty.I love it alot.
