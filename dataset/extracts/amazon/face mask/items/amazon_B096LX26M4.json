This mask may not be the most protective on the market, but it\u2019s protective enough, and it\u2019s kind to my face. This is a mask I will wear without suffering.It\u2019s basically a surgical mask, but in fashionable black, rather than operating-room blue. I\u2019m fashion conscious, so I like a black mask. And I like the fact that it\u2019s made in the USA. I don\u2019t trust masks made in countries that use noxious chemicals in their manufacturing processes. This mask has no smell, a good sign.The mask fans out to fit my face, and there\u2019s a nose pincher to further improve the fit. It\u2019s very lightweight.",

I am reviewing the black 50 ct masks.They used to fit so well and were thick but not suffocatingly so. I could wear them all day while teaching and had no issues. I loved that they were made in America and had no odor.The most recent box *looked* the same but the quality has significantly decreased enough to leave this review.The masks that I received were so thin (I could feel the difference) and do not fit well on my face. I feel the elastic is thin and almost seems stretched out and it feels like I have a thin tissue paper over my nose and mouth.Tried calling the phone number on the website but only got a voice mail. If this is the new quality going forward I will have to stop my subscription and shop elsewhere. I will change my 3 stars (probably should be 2) if the next shipment is back to normal.",

This one filled the bill.Big enough to accommodate my large cerebrum with comfortable ear loops (they don't make me look like a scared cat pulling its ears forward to detect a possible threat), and I can talk and chew gum at the same time without the mask pulling down to my chin. Therefore, I give it high marks for \"oration facilitation\".Sure, it's not of the higher standards of a N95 or KN95 mask, but it's just a step beneath that and functional enough to fill my personal requirements. If I need an N95, I'll get one. Otherwise, this one is perfectly fine for my needs and reasonably priced.",
