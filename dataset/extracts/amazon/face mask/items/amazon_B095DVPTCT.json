                "reviewText": "These are very comfortable and secure fitting, and don't put unpleasant pressure on the bridge of my nose like my previous rigid 3M (#8511) N95 mask did. The foam nose band runs all across the inside top and provides a comfortable, moldable, snug seal that does a better job of keeping my glasses from fogging than my previous mask, except if I exhale with a big sigh through my mouth or nose, but even then, the fogging is slight and dissipates quickly. I wasn\u2019t able to wear my glasses in the correct position with my rigid mask, but don\u2019t have that problem with this mask.Breathing in this one is a little warmer than my previous KN95 and valved #8511, and on warm days I can feel the beginnings of a little bit of sweat above and below my lip , but it's worth it for me to have the full, all-around close fit protection an N95 mask provides that KN95's don't. I like that they fold flat for carrying around.In case this is helpful, I have an average sized head and full face with a square-ish jaw. The mask sits higher on the bridge of my nose than on the guy in the picture--about half inch above the inside corner of my eyes, is 8\" (accounting for the \u201cduck bill\u201d expansion) from the top to the bottom of the chin tab and about 6\u201d side to side on the widest part of the chin tab area.A reviewer said the mask smelled like pickle or salt and vinegar chips and I agree, they do smell a bit like that (it\u2019s the foam nose band and not the mask itself), but it didn\u2019t bother me and like the same reviewer said, you don\u2019t notice it after a while. It did NOT smell like burnt rubber mentioned in another review.The middle part is stiff like the rigid N95s, but the top and bottom part are a soft, flexible (kind of reminds me of slightly worn jeans) and what appears to be more breathable fabric. The straps look like long wide, flat rubber bands and appear to be securely stapled--I pulled pretty hard on them at the ends and they didn\u2019t move from under the staples. Since they\u2019re smooth, they slide down my hair if I don\u2019t put them high enough on my head, but they\u2019 re comfortable in that position and I hardly notice them at all.I was looking for something to replace my rigid, valved N95s and I'm happy with these.",

I primarily use them when I'm flying so that I have that added layer of protection as most have ditched masks but they haven't ditched being nasty with their uncovered coughs and sneezes. I don't use the blue straps so I can't speak to the level of comfort with something over your head, but I punch small holes on the ends and thread a hair tie through to make ear loops. I find this comfortable and easy to take off and put back on when at TSA checkpoints or if I need to eat or drink. The nose is flexible and has padding to add to the comfort. I do thing they're pricy, but when protecting your health if you can afford them, get them.",

                "reviewText": "It seems like a decent mask. I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d with a regular-sized face and chin. This masks fits, but just barely, my little face. If I had a slightly longer chin, the bottom of the mask would ride up. There is no stretch whatsoever to this mask; the straps have stretch, but not the mask. I\u2019m not a fan of the behind-the-head straps, but I understand that type of strap is required to get the NIOSH approval and because it supposedly provides a better seal. On my face, the mask does create a tight, cup-like seal. It has a really good, padded nose wire. I find it fairly easy to breathe through. It also doesn\u2019t smash my nose as much as all my cloth masks do.Mine has a gross odor which doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s healthy to be inhaling all day. The mask starts to hurt my face and head after about 10 minutes. On me, the mask is a tight fit. I guess that gives it a good seal, but that also creates uncomfortable pressure on the face and head. When I take the mask off, the imprint of the mask remains on my face and there\u2019s a lot of moisture on my face. I\u2019d never get through more than an hour of wearing this mask because I just want to tear it off my face.So, basically, I prefer my cloth masks because they are comfortable, have stretch, have ear straps, and are black in color, but according to all that I\u2019ve read so far they are not very protective against Omicron. This 3M mask provides better Omicron protection but I find it way less comfortable and I don\u2019t like the smell.",
