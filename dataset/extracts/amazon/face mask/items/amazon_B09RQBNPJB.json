                "reviewText": "This review is for Made In USA ASTM Level 3 Face Mask 4 ply Disposable Masks Facial Cover, Elastic Ear Loops, For Adults & Kids (Box of 50). That's how it is listed on Amazon.Now that the box is here (arrived timely and in good order), I see the brand is CP Shield. Two stickers on the box indicate it is ASTM Level 3, but the box itself does not so indicate. I could not find the Owner/operator number on the Internet. Hmmn. Anyway, the box was sealed with a sticker, and the masks themselves were in a plastic bag. I like this as it keeps dust out. Other boxes of masks I have open like a box of facial tissue. This box does not. It's a tad less convenient, but again it helps keep dust out. I'm pleased with the packaging.The listing strongly implies the masks are sterile -- see fourth photo in the product listing -- but the box says they are NOT. However, they do seems very clean. Perhaps they are not sterile in the medical sense.I wore one today for several hours. It was so easy to breathe, I got suspicious and cut one in half when I got home. Yes, indeed, there are four layers -- thin layers. Does it filter as well as described on Amazon? Well, I guess we have to take them at their word. The 3 ply Chinese masks I have seem thicker.Nose piece is fine. Ear loops are more comfortable than other masks I have tried. I see mixed reviews about the ear loops. The size of your face and location of your ears may determine your comfort level. I have a smaller head; larger persons may have to add an ear saver to their order.The box says replace the mask every four hours. I have never seen this on any other box of masks.I got these during the Christmas sale. They cost me about $1 more than fifty 3 ply Chinese masks. Today's price seems comparable to other four ply masks on Amazon., but of course not as cheap as 3 ply masks.I'd buy again at the next sale.",

When you squeeze the nosepiece, my glasses don\u2019t fog up. The four ply is protective and still easy to breathe. There is no scent to them. I will buy again.",
