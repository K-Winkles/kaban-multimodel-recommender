No idea on how much filtering, but they felt like the blue ones I was using, and I feel they will do what I want (keep droplets off me at the store). I wish all these masks could be rated (even if at sub-medical levels) for us to compare to, say, a cotton bandana, but without that rating I still feel they are fine for my purposes.",
