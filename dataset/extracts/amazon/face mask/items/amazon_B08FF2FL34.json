                "reviewText": "The mask is very soft and feels good. All but the little piece of wire that goes over the bridge of your nose. that wire is meant to form your mask top to your face or nose. That wire is so weak it can't even hold its own shape so it allows the mask to fall down and eventually fall off the tip of your nose while you're running. Or if you tend to like I do open up your mouth while you run or ride your bike it pulls a mess down off your nose. Great mask just needs some more design help on it. I will have to return this because every time it slips down it renders the mask ineffective. So instead of fidgeting with the mask during my entire run I'll find another one that works correctly.So here is my update; I went to the gym last night and did a 3 mi run on the treadmill. Before I was able to complete my first mile my heart rate was way up more than normal. I'm normally around 131 bpm avg. And at the gym I was over 160. It was very difficult or at least it felt difficult to bring enough air into my lungs. The cool effect of the mask does nothing. I was just sucking in hot air. But I can say the mask is very comfortable for walking around or going shopping or going into a restaurant. But as far as the sports mask goes I had to take it off and put my old mask on. This is only my opinion you take it for what it's worth. The mask looks good, it's really soft on your skin and it does stay away from your mouth so you can speak. I think it's excellent for everyday use such as shopping or going out or being in a group or at work however I won't be running any 5Ks with this mask on.",

                "reviewText": "I bought for running in my area and hiking. Too many people are out to maintain a good distance, so I put a mask on whenever I need to. Typically, I'll have it on for 2-3 minutes at a time. It's much easier to breathe in and much more comfortable than any of my other masks. But, it certainly isn't \"easy to breathe in\" or \"comfortable to run in.\"Make sure you measure your vertical and horizontal measurements and use Table B. If they don't match the same size, get the larger one. There is no way I could have worn the size recommended by Table A. Table B has my vertical measurement at the top end of LG/XL while my horizontal measurement was in the middle of MD/LG. The only challenge is that there is no adjustment to the earloops, so the mask can feel a bit loose.The earloops are very thin and stretchy, good for comfort, not so good for fit. They rapidly get soaked in sweat and hard to manipulate. Since I am putting it on and taking it off constantly, I'd prefer soft, tubular, but non-stretchy earloops with a way to adjust their length to the width of my face.The flimsy nose wire requires a good bit of pressure to get it into proper shape, then loses that shape over time, requiring another push after a minute or so. I think the UA wire is closer to best than the standard flat nosepiece you see in most masks, but it would be better if it was a bit stiffer.The mask material is puffy, which gives it a bit of shape, but that thickness and the fact that at rest there is a significant space between your face and the mask also makes the air you breathe stuffier, as you re-breathe the air that doesn't get forced all the way through the mask. I suspect there is some benefit against disease spread, but since I'm only wearing it outdoors and generally staying more than 6 feet from everyone, that isn't my primary concern. I have an N95 for when I need to go to indoor public spaces. I'd prefer a tighter fit to my face, with less airspace behind the mask, and a slightly less flexible fabric in the breathing area.So, it's far from perfect, but more perfect for my needs than any other mask that isn't just a glorified bandana. I'll buy a replacement as soon as someone makes something better, but I'll buy another if this one wears out before anyone does.",

                "reviewText": "I was given a mask by my employer back in the summer of 2021 when we returned to the office. I absolutely hated wearing facial masks because I couldn't breathe or speak freely without the mask connecting with my lips and nose. Also, the fabric thickness left me overheated and the ear straps irritated my skin. They also would gap and didn't provide full protection. I spent so much money on masks that didn't work!! I'm sure I'm not alone. This mask was in a game changer!! This mask is lightweight, the design creates a spacious air pocket btw my mouth and nose and the fabric so I can comfortably breathe and be heard easily. The soft texture feels so gentle and light on my skin I don't feel any tension on my ears. I can handwash it easily with a little dish or hand soap and it air dries fast (30 mins in a sunny window).The only negative (and this is with every mask I've worn) is in hot weather the bridge of my nose will sweat from the heat and condensation from my breath. Although the nose bridge on this mask does have absorbent fabric it still gets damp and is not very pleasant after long wear. I couldn't imagine having to wear it to workout in, but I suppose if I had to wear a mask anyway, this would be the only one that would work at all. All in all, I love it! It keeps it's shape, and is so lightweight you'll forget it's on. It's also incredibly durable. I still have the original mask, which looks like new, and I bought 1 more as a back up. Perfect!",
