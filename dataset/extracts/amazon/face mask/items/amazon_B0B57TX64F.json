After 3 sheets every other night, my skin now looks much more improved with the tiny wrinkles on my smiling face 90% diminished. Just a quick note on how I used the mask: I placed it on my face and left it there until it was dry, so about 2 hours. Strongly recommend!",

I\u2019m happy I listened to online recommendations for this brand and caved and tried these to see how they are, it\u2019s 100% hydrating, no doubt about it. Only reason I give 4/5 is that its VERY VERY hydrating, to the point of where it leaves a bit of a sheen/oily shine on the skin thats pretty noticeable in the mirror and to other people id assume. I wouldn\u2019t recommend these specific ones (watermide) to someone with oily skin, maybe try the collagen ones instead or the others but definitely to someone with dry/combo/sensitive skin like me i\u2019d say to try this one. Just make sure you dont have somewhere to be afterwards and use it maybe before bed or while lounging for a few hours because of that weird sheen it leaves lol. But overall very hydrating, little smell and non irritating for my sensitive skin which is good :)",
