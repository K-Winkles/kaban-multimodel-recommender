                "reviewText": "Oh, I like this. This is one of the better face masks I have seen. I tend to wake up with puffy face some mornings and I could really use this mask to help reduce that puffiness. It covers my face entirely - even under my eyes where most of eye bags begin over sleepless nights or water retention. The color is a beautiful aqua that, to me, screams, \"spa.\" The mask looks and feels well made and the gel beads feel really nice and squishy. The plastic seems sturdy enough to withstand heat or cold. Both sides of the mask are usable. The reverse side of the mask is soft and plush, like velour. The straps are adjustable and have velcro closure.I keep this mask chilled in the fridge in a special container so on the days I wake up puffy I don't have to wait a few hours for it to get cold. I can just reach for it and sit back with this cold mask on my face and relax for a few minutes. It's a lot better than using ice cubes on my face - this gel face mask works just as well without the mess of melting water. Cold packs really do work against fighting facial puffiness. You can almost feel the release when it is reduced. I haven't used this as a heat pack yet but I am glad it serves as both cold and heat pack.Excellent gel bead face mask. Attractive color and perfect fit on my face. It sits comfortably on my face and feels good on. It does what I want it to do. No more puffy face.",

One side has the gel beads, and the other side is soft and plush, you can use it either way. As per the instructions, it tells you to keep in the fridge (not the freezer) for a couple of hours for cold therapy... or you can place it in the microwave or hot water for hot therapy. As part of my facial skincare routine I started incorporating ice massage on my face after cleansing and before applying makeup, but this mask makes it so much easier, no water dripping! ... Before placing in the fridge, I wiped it down with my simple mixture of white vinegar and water on both sides, and I keep it in the fridge inside a bag that's specially to keep items in the fridge, and always wipe it down after use and before going in the fridge again. I love how it feels on my face, it's very soothing and calming, it definitely elevates my skincare routine, but of course it has so many other benefits using it cold or hot for health and beauty.",

                "reviewText": "I haven't used this as a hot pack but for cool relief, it's a gem. The cutouts on the mask fit a bit strangely, the eyes are fine but the nose and mouth are off. The area over the nose and below the eyes doesn't sit against your face snuggly, which is just frustrating. And if that weren't all, it really must be aired out before using, the smell is rather strong.That's not to say it's not helpful.. just flawed.Update: The seller quickly contacted me with a generous offer to replace my mask with a new one but I've adjusted the mask myself by carefully cutting the areas I had a problem with and it fits much more comfortably. The gel beads, when cooled, feels like heaven when my head or sinuses are bothering me and I'm quite happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "This face mask is filled with individual pea sized gel beads that can be moved around, making it easy to conform the mask to the exact contours of your face. One side of the mask is covered in a soft velour material and the other side is made from a flexible plastic. You can put either side against your skin depending on how cold/hot you want it feel on your skin (the fabric acts as a little bit of barrier and the temps don't feel as extreme on that side). It was easy to chill the mask (I put it in the fridge for a couple hours) and easy to heat the mask (I microwaved it for about 15 seconds). I especially love the chilled feeling on my skin - it feels so refreshing.FUNNIR Gel Beads Face Ice Mask Pack to Reduce Puffiness, Dark Circles, Hot Cold Compress Pack, Face Spa for Woman Sleeping, Pressure",
