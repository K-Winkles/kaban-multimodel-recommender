                "reviewText": "These are larger than many of the standard size blue masks I had been getting.Although they are not as snug as others, as the nose clip does not take shape like those with a thicker metal nose piece, they are more comfortable to wear and easier to breath through.They do cover more of your face which I prefer to some of the smaller blue procedure masks.I haven't had any issues with loops malfunctioning (the dreaded out-of-the-box ear loop disconnecting). You do have to look at the masks to see which side is out (ribs when opened facing down), as the ear loops are attached to the inner layers during manufacture, instead of being bonded on the inside at the last stage of manufacture for every other mask I have purchased.The box is clearly labeled as CE certified, which is also rare to non-existent on many of the other disposable masks I have purchased.May be too large for teens or those with narrow faces.These are my new favorite.",
