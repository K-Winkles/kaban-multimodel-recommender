The box is this cardboard which rips easily so you have to carefully open it to get another mask out. They aren't folded in the packaging in such a way that you can grab one like a tissue, the straps get tangled on each other. It takes a little care to get a fresh new one. They do last through multiple shopping trips. I fold mine in half for next time. My 8 year old size kid can wear one with the ear loops in a twist before looping over the ears. My 5 year old can wear one with tiny little knots tied in the middle of each loop. They fit large faces well and don't rid up or down. I do get foggy glasses once in awhile, but try pressing the nose piece tighter and slipping the top edge under my bottom edge of my lenses, that helps. I keep the box in my car glove box so we always have some with us. I am happy with the purchase and quality of product. I worried with the bad reviews of the straps not being attached well enough, but we had no issues with that, but we are careful getting them out of the box not to pull too hard.",
