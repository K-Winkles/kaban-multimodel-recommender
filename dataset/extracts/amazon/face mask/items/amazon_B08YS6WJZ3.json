It is N95 so more effective than cloth masks, which I had to buy in the past to avoid ear loops. The price is great, as a cloth mask with straps (just one) cost me $15! Note: the size is almost too big, perhaps for females, but will fit a man sized face or one with a beard without a problem. When I am clean shaven, it still fits well enough.",

This is the only company that offers black masks with around the head straps that's listed on the ProjectN95.org site so I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and order again and I'm glad I did... it was an unfortunate bad batch before, but it's back to the original quality I had come to expect.November 2023: I ordered these back in May, they were great. Ordered again in October and all of them keep ripping where the lower string attaches to the mask the first time I use it, opening the surrounding hole rendering it useless. Really bummed. They were 5-star previously.",

                "reviewText": "When we speak of comfort regarding an N-95 mask, we need to be sure we are comparing it to other N-95 masks. Compared to lesser cloth, fabric, paper, masks, N-95 masks are not comfortable. They have to properly fit your face leaving no gaps and for some wearers they may make breathing more laborious. If you're not sure you have Halitosis, just put on an N-95 mask. Unless your sense of smell is greatly diminished, you'll be able to tell right away. :-))Among N-95 masks that I've worn, the BNX N95 are as/or more comfortable. In addition I perceive the quality to be better as when I put these on, I don't have the string breaking where it attaches to the mask as I try to place the lower string over my head to the back of my neck. Not all rated N-95 masks are created equal when it comes to quality.Now everyone's face is different; so your mileage may vary as to how this mask fits your face. Obviously beard length will also be an issue. For me the BNX was a perfect fit with great quality. They are a bit more expensive at purchase, but if the strings don't break like the cheaper ones, they are actually a better value.My only complaint is minor and one of vanity. I would prefer that the brand and mask information was less conspicuous, but there may be some legal requirement for it.I would not hesitate to buy this brand again and hope they are available when I need to do so.",

                "reviewText": "First off, while these are certified by NIOSH to be N95 respirators, these seem to be blurring the line on what should be considered as an \"N95\" respirator and a \"KN95\" respirator. To have nearly the same layers as the GB2626-2019 standard but have the main difference being \"it has to have headband straps\" really sets the bar so low in terms of NIOSH-certified respirator masks that filter at least 95% of non-oily particulates at 2.5 microns or less.Secondly, amazing comfort from the straps and even the face part of it, but the non-woven layer that goes on your face is still rather abrasive. It's not as terrible as other (then KN95) respirators from this same company (AccuMed) where their white ones are oddly scratchier than their black counterparts, but I still get at least a mild allergic reaction to it, as evidently shown on my nose turning red with what seems to be slight swelling at the end where the mask sits--this also makes my nose run, like a good number of respirators do.Third, despite its comfort, it still uses the shitty clamshell design, which counterintuitively bends the metal band that sits at the nasal bridge far too sharply. This makes it so damn easy for air leaks to occur under your eyes and along your nasal bridge when exhaling. According to CDC guidelines, you have to test with your hands around the edges of the mask and breathe in and out sharply to test the airtightness of the mask. Well, this mask and others like it fail very hard at it once I let it go, even if I pretty much don't have any facial hair on it. I wear glasses, so I can absolutely see the air leak happening. Also, the clamshell design makes it harder to actually talk and make other facial expressions, which is a major drawback. (My face is slender enough that this shouldn't be an issue, but it is.)Fourth, cost-per-mask is an utter RIPOFF ($2.30/mask - $2.50/mask). 3M's respirators are still in high demand and the cost per respirator is still relatively low, and they managed to make it so there is a foam pad for your nose, which is designed to not only let less air out completely unfiltered, but also to prevent (of course) very fine particles from getting in your mask without filtration, which viruses can also get in with or without respiratory droplets. (Viruses heavily depend on respiratory droplets and the path to least resistance in order to get in our respiratory systems, but viruses can still survive for a shorter period of time without any respiratory droplets.) I'm genuinely convinced that companies such as AccuMed and other KN95/N95 sellers and distributors are and *have been* purposefully cashing in on the pandemic and exploiting their consumers for it, which I find to be extremely amoral and unjust in every aspect.Fifth and last, on top of other aforementioned positives in this review, breathability is not actually that half bad. Like most other respirators, they eventually develop a level of air resistance as there is more moisture buildup. BUT! I do also want to mention that this mask, like every other clamshell mask, will make you constantly readjust it every time you move your head anywhere NEAR the directions other than straight ahead: (the perceived) filtration performance is usually worse when looking lower than straight, and possibly almost close to the extreme positions (left up and right, other than just downward) enables the mask to be shifted some. I'm led to believe that this issue exists in a great number of KN95 and N95 respirators on the market, right now.Overall: I would look elsewhere for N95 or even KN95 respirators. There are better options out there, and I do not recommend most people get an otherwise subpar mask for an unreasonably higher asking price.",

Too many fakes out there, but these are genuine as far as I can tell. They're well-made, inner lining is soft and comfortable, and it doesn't fall apart easily like cheap dust masks tend to do. Filter works well as the other NIOSH-approved N95's I've worn in the past, as it hinders or blocks scents in the air.My only suggestion to buyers would be to flatten out the creased middle section of the nose piece before molding it to fit your face, as it is quite angular straight out of the package.",
