                "reviewText": "This set of face masks (not the COVID kind, the facial moisturizing types) is great for the Disney fan. The box includes four different masks, each one individually packaged with one of your favorite animated cartoon characters (Ariel, Aurora, Jasmine and Belle). When you open the box, it unfolds, map-like, to reveal each individual packet with an explanatory insert for each character. Each one has a different scent - the masks themselves aren't upscale but they're OK for the price. The packaging is very cute and would make a nice gift for a teenager or a Disney-loving adult.",

These are sheet masks and the packaging is cuter than the actual masks within, but nonetheless, they make for a great stocking stuffer style of gifting for that special little princess who loves her Disney Princesses.",

I've only used one of them so far and I did like it, but it seems very similar to most sheet masks I have used, nothing particularly unique about it aside from the packaging.I was hoping to look like a princess after, but no...",
