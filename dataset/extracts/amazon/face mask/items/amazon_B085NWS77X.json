                "reviewText": "Apparently, these are the same masks being sold by another Amazon seller; the other seller is a few pennies cheaper (see my other review).I received five sealed bags of masks. Each bag has 10 masks. The masks were made by Ocean Green and the storage period is two years. The masks were made in Shenzhen and my masks were made on 5/16/2020.I performed stress tests on the masks. They do have three layers and the loops only came off the masks after I pulled hard. Additionally, I poured water from the inside and inside layer is indeed water proof. I also dumped a full vacuum container full of dust into a large garbage can. There were dust flying everywhere and the mask successfully stopped the dust from traveling through the layers. Having said that, the mask is definitely not heavy duty. However, I bought the masks because they were some of the least expensive masks available at Amazon. These masks performed adequately. So much so I ordered some more.On the outside off the package, it clearly states the product is a non-medical device. Would I wear these masks in a hospital? Probably not during the pandemic. I would wear them if I go to the stores or when I go back to work in the office.",

                "reviewText": "I used these masks at the height of the COVID-19 lockdowns and wish I'd found the porous ones I currently use off Etsy sooner, but these still came in handy in the interim! I used them in a fast-paced setting surrounded by metal and concrete and in sweltering/freezing temperatures year round, and they held up throughout. Also funny enough, these masks were how I figured out that my manager is blue/white colorblind, as he consistently wore them inside out. Other findings include...Personal pros:-Nice blue/almost white color makes them look quite calming.-Sturdy middle stays strong through running, jumping, twisting, stretching, bending, varying temperatures, and more.-Absorbent cloth that catches plenty of sweat and still remains functional.-Seller (MAXIMUS DEALS) shipped them quickly and promptly and sold them at a great price.Personal cons:-Flimsy and easily breakable straps and single fit option. I tried combining them with clips looped behind my head for an even tighter fit and the straps would quickly (if not immediately) snap from stretching. This can be remedied somewhat by simply pulling the straps more taut and binding them.-The straps were rough on my skin even on slow days after about six hours of use and, after enough time, chafed the skin around my ear and became painful to wear. I switched masks soon after this and now recommend avoiding overuse if possible. Other possible solutions might include switching straps and/or masks and/or covering that part of the ear if possible.-The base/middle slides around quite easily and is likely meant for smaller faces than mine, but it should not impede the use and/or function for others. This can be largely remedied by shaving as completely as possible.-The triple+-ply construction, while ostensibly increasing the protective factor, also makes them far less breathable. Their sturdiness surprisingly makes them difficult to wear for longer periods (30+ minutes) simply because it's difficult to breathe while wearing them. This can be somewhat remedied by not exerting oneself while wearing them.With a strong construction that holds up under lots of physical activity, stress and varying temperatures but uncomfortable and easily breakable straps (if stretched) and few fit options, these masks are at least an easy 3/5!",

                "reviewText": "These face masks are just like the ones you get when you walk into Home Depot or other places that give you one. It was actually much sturdier than I expected. I was leery of the price being so good, figured the product would be horrible and cheap. I was totally surprised because first they were packed very securely in a tight plastic wrap. I had read the reviews and just knew when I pulled one out to try it that it would be thin and flimsy and probably break immediately. That was not the case. The strings are attached firmly. The material is sturdy (I was expecting tissue thin or like tissue paper) and the quality is really surprising. I will buy more if we are still needing them when I run out.",
