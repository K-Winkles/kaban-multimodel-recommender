                "reviewText": "I heard so many things about Mediheal sheet masks and their number 1 popular sheet mask brand and their just notorious for them so I was itching to try it out! I just know their good.Since it's my first time trying them out, I wanted a lot of them so thankfully they have a variety multi pack!This is great to gift to anyone who enjoys using them. I've used a couple and their super moisturizing!! I like using these for 30 minutes since their just so much essence. It's super relaxing to have it on and chill.I personally like to just put the mask after use into a used up moisturizer tub and just take it out and use the left over essence on my face and neck until it's used up. I just squeeze it into my palms. It's frugal but I'm making sure I get every last drop of it.Overall, I love this! having the multi-pack is fun since I can try them all out~~",
