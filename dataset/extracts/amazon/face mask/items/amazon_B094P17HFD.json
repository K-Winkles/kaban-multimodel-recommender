So it's a trade off (they also cost twice).I tried the korean KF94 masks, but the good masks KN95 masks are way more comfortable. I would love to be able to get a bigger discount on a 50 masks package, hope they will make it one day (or maybe sell two 25 packs at a discount for bulk buyers like me ..)",

I have a small face and my partner\u2019s face is medium to large and neither of us can get it to seal properly even with tying knots on ear loops or twisting them. Sadly they will go to waste because masks aren\u2019t worth much if they dont seal.",
