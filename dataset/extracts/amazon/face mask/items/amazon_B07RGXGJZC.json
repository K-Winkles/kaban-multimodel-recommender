                "reviewText": "Amazing moisturizing sheet mask! I love sheet masks and typically try to do one at least once a week to relax. I've upped my numbers during the pandemic and my husband bought these along with some others as a Mother's Day gift. I was surprised at how affordable they were after using one.I struggle with dryness and redness on my face, but also have a tendency to get really oily skin when using certain moisturizers. Halayuronic acid always does nice work for me, but shea butter can easily cause oiliness. This mask was the perfect balance. It felt so cool and soothing while on and my skin absorbed the serum completely with no residue.My only complaint would be that the scent was very close to being too perfume-y for me to enjoy. I really can't stand floral scents and while the floral note on this one was far enough in the background to be tolerable, it would have been so much more enjoyable if it were not there at all. Overall, still definitely a product I would recommend and use again; if you happen to like a light floral scent, this is truly a perfect sheet mask for you.",

                "reviewText": "This is an HG (holy grail) sheet mask. It's got key ingredients to repair and calm skin (centella asiatica & aloe) and keep blemishes at bay (niacinamide, willow bark, ferment extract) while being gentle and ultra-moisturizing. I love to wash up, and hop in bed or the tub with one of these on for up to 30 minutes. Then peel off and pat the serum in, maybe even pat in another treatment (like my propolis ampoule [from Glow] and/or a favorite toner [Dear Klairs - unscented]) and wake up to plump, hydrated, glowy skin! Tightens pores and makes makeup go on like a dream. I have reordered these already and have a pack of FaceTory Tea Tree masks on the way too. This winter, these are keeping me two steps ahead of eczema flare-ups that are conveniently only on my face. :)These are SOAKED with serum (enough leftover to apply 2-3 more times) and I was delighted with the Step 1 ampoule that includes a gush of Aloe and other feel-good ingredients to apply before the mask. FaceTory is truly raising the sheet mask game - while keeping it affordable to pamper ourselves. Love, Love, Love.",

There wasn\u2019t any fragrance that I had picked up on & Think the packaging is cute! (I only wish the first step was more easier to distribute BUT still not disappointed) This was after only a one time use, but I am excited to use the rest of what I have or possibly purchase more!",

Unlike the other sheet mask, this mask , the ingredient is separated from the sheet and remains inside the package . I had to scrape it off with spatula to get everything cream off and place on my face before i place the masks sheet . A bit messy but result is great !I am not sure if I am willing to all this effort for a disposable mask. But for the moisturizing result , i may purchase again knowing what i need to do .",
