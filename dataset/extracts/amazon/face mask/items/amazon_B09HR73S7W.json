                "reviewText": "These are great masks. I have bought all different ones in the past year. They are great because they are individually wrapped, so you can keep them in a sports bag, purse, or I keep the box in my car and you know you always have a clean mask. The kid size fits me as an adult because many of the adult sizes are too big and fit my 8 year old `1 nbhgftrewq1 year old fairly well. They are a little big for the really small faces. We had to tie one up for my almost 4 year old niece because it was large for you. We use them everyday, but they are especially good for amusement parks or when you are outside because they protect you but are lightweight. Being the more paper type material, kids can ruin them, my son will stick his tongue out and make a hole in the mask and sometimes the bands will rip off, but this is very rare unless you are trying to. We have worn them to Disney World and two other amusement problems and they are great. With them being wrapped in plastic, you can put extras in your purse or pocket and they won't get wet. We also love the fun designs.",

The masks have a light weight wire support to form fit on the bridge of the nose for support and comfort. It is easily bendable. The elastic is the right length from face to behind my ears with out having to twist it to fit, nor is it to tight. The stretch is perfect, and durable for on and off removal- I have only broken one elastic out of the entire box of 50 and was shocked when it happened.My coworkers love the different prints on them and so do the children I provide care to.Each mask is individually wrapped.I highly recommend theses masks. Especially if you have a small framed face and are a full size person.",

                "reviewText": "Bought these mask for my nine-year-old son to wear for school. They were comfortable and fun design. I like that the masks were individually wrapped. The only thing I would complain about is that a few of the strings broke of the mask as we were putting them on but it was only 3-4 out of the whole box. It\u2019s wouldn\u2019t have been better if none of the mash had broke.",

He will be two in May but we\u2019re trying to get him comfortable with masks & honestly it\u2019s the only thing he knows unfortunately since he was born during the pandemic. Anyways very cute, nice patterns and super convenient. May repurchase once my son is older so that he can wear them if world still requires them at that time",
