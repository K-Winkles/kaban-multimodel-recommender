Plus I\u2019ve been able to try some in this packet that i haven\u2019t seen at the store it self. They are perfect for when you get home and are just trying to relax and drink some wine and watch your favorite show. I also love how every time I\u2019ve ordered I always get different ones so I\u2019m able to just try them all out in a way. Definetly will be ordering more for my \u201cme time\u201d",
