                "reviewText": "I have read a few reviews about these masks, and I was apprehensive about buying them because there was conflicting points-of-view. One person said that there were \u201cno pockets\u201d and another said that there were. To set the record straight, these masks do have a pocket for a 2.5 PM filter (see pictures).First impressions: they are all built as described. The seams, stitches are impeccable, have no loose strands anywhere on them, material feels smooth to the touch, fitment conforms to my face and nose very well. The whole design is meticulous, every detail from the elastic straps around the ears, the conformity of the shape to fit the face, to the pocket for the filter.I am wearing my mask as I am writing this article. Typically, the only time that I notice is when I inhale, the reason for this has to do with the flexing of the material; when I breathe in, this tells me that the mask's outer edges are sealing against my face to prevent leakage. I like that! Now, when I breathe out, I can feel my breath gently blowing through and out of the top near my nose, but closes again when I breathe in. My glasses get slightly foggy, but it's not bad. Finally, the ear straps are quite comfortable and don't hurt my ears. But, I worry about losing the rubber ear-strap stops; because I have lost these on other masks that I have owned.Of course, at this time, I don't have my 2.5 PM filter to test them, but I will get them soon.Overall, It is a pleasant experience to wear a mask that feels so comfortable that I forget I am wearing it. In addition, I feel confident that this mask will protect me, knowing it has copper woven into the material and a filter. (Filter must be purchased separately.)Update: Tuesday, June 14, 2022I have not lost the stops for ear straps! Yea! Usually, by this time I would have, but for some reason they stay on the string though they do move once in a while and need to be readjusted, but that doesn't bother me. So Far, so good. These masks are wonderful and work great.",

This mask (adjustable sizes) not only fits me but the design of the chin part keeps it in place even if you're talking. I've worn these on multiple trans-Atlantic flights and was comfortable. They are washable and have replaceable filters, which is also a bonus. I've purchased these more than once and would recommend.",
