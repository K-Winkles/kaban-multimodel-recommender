                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been needing new disposable masks for work and was interested in these because of their shape (the usual rectangle ones would ride up into my eyes)When I received them, they were nicely condensed in one package and the colors are really nice. There\u2019s black, light pink, blush, purple, navy blue, and like a cream/beige color.I used some these past couple weeks and I enjoy them a lot! They\u2019re thicker than the regular \u201cblue medical disposable\u201d ones, and the inside is quite soft. The shape is perfect for my face since it only goes over my nose and it goes down my cheeks away from my eyes. And it\u2019s sectioned in three parts to stay snug under my chin.I think the only eh parts is the fact that because it\u2019s snug- it presses onto my cheeks and when you exhale kind of hard, it fogs the glasses. But thankfully there\u2019s room for my nose/ mouth so it\u2019s not pressing up against it, and my glasses being fogged is a given so I\u2019m not too bothered.I included different angled pictures to help see how it\u2019s formed and the colors of the masks aren\u2019t too far off from what it looks like (the purple isn\u2019t that vibrant in real life)",

                "reviewText": "I hate how one day they're less than $10 and the next they're $15. Why? I was hoping they'd be in individual bags of ten but they were cramped in a medium sized bag and were air suctioned flat. FYI: you'll need a different bag to store them in. Once opened, the masks loosen up, expand and can easily fall out of the non-reusable bag that doesn't zip closed. That's frustrating. The description doesn't clarify this point of packaging and shipping.Other than that, these masks are comfortable and lightweight, easy to breathe in and they tend to stay put better than others I've tried. I haven't bought from this particular seller with these masks before but the masks themselves I've been using for quite some time now and have no complaints. I'm a massage therapist and I'm required to continue wearing a mask while I work. For the price, quantity and quality of the masks, it's worth it.",
