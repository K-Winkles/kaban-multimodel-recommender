But because of the special period now, I ordered these masks. When I got these masks, I found that they were not fragile and of good quality. They are packed in plastic packaging inside the mask box, and there are two layers of packaging, which makes me feel that these masks are very safe. They also came earlier than expected. My order arrived within 4 working days. Considering that there are so many people ordering now, the speed of the order is indeed very fast. They are comfortable and light. I decided to order another box. If you need masks, you can order it, please don't hesitate!",

But if you've used other disposables in the past, do be aware that these masks are slightly on the small side -- about 6.75\" wide x 4\" tall before wearing. Should fit fine if you are petite or average, but for a large face these won't fit/cover very well.",

Plus it arrived within two days after I ordered it, unlike a previous order a while ago from a different vendor which took about a month to deliver.They are somewhat basic and being disposable don't feel quite as protective as reusable ones, but protection is more about fit and how porous the material is and whether there is a second layer. These have three layers. Plus it has a bendable metal nose clip to ensure a snug fit around the nose, which they don't mention in the description, but is important.",

The only down side is the elastic that goes around the ear is a too long to get a snug fit for my face. However, I just tied a knot in each end of the elastic to shorten the length a bit and the mask fits more snugly now without impacting the ability to breathe.",

They are worth 10 stars!",
