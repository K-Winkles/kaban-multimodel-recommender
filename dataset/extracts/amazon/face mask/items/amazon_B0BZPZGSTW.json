It did not work out well for me because the nose piece is very limited on how it moves however the mask itself is designed nice and the gel beads inside are very soft making it a comfortable mask to have on your face instead of a sheet of hard ice like other masks when frozen. Has an adjustable strap would be perfect to use after doing a nice skin care routine.",

Then I will place the mask on, which is very easy to do, and leave on my face for 30 minutes. I usually lay on the couch and watch some tv or read a book while I let the mask do its magic. I love how it tightens the skin and reduces my pores. I will also place over a treated mask to aid in my skin capturing the benefits from the mask. After I am done, I simply rinse off and then dry and then put in the refrigerator until I am ready to use it again. I am 51 years old and not that I should know what 51 should look like but I don't think I look 51. The price was just right too! Didn't have to spend and arm and a leg to get great benefits.",

Also when placed in a freezer for too long, it is impossible to mold it to the shape of the face because the frozen beads don\u2019t move well.",

It folds around my face well. I keep this mask in the fridge and use it for a few minutes after showers to decrease facial inflammation. It works great.",
