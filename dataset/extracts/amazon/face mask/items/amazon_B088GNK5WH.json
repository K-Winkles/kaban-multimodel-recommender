It fits my face perfectly. I have no trouble with my glasses and safety goggles fogging up with these, which is a problem I have struggled with forever, especially since the pandemic (I always had trouble back when I did medical and manufacturing work that required any sort of mask, much more than others. My face shape just doesnt play well with masks and glasses.). This mask doesnt shrink in the wash (unlike the crap Hayne's masks) and my work means they get very dirty and I wash them in hit water and the heavy soil cycle. It breathes very well but still feels substantial unlike some other masks that breath well but are so loosely weaved as to be basically useless for any sort of filtration. The design is also neat, but not my main concern. I just reordered this pack and the pack of black masks this seller is offering. They cost a slight bit more than some of the others out there but it's absolutely worth it because they aren't miserable to wear and they will outlast the cheaper ones.",

They are soft and comfortable to wear, have the nose metal piece to clamp down and avoid fogging my glasses, and the outer fabric is a wicking material which helps the mask stay dry. (They have multiple layers of fabric though so they still feel very safe, I actually prefer these over any of the surgical masks because they feel like they fit snugly to my face with no gaps.) I also always get compliments on the galaxy design, which I love because it matches so many colors. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I wear a lot of cloth masks (total i have about 20 of other kinds of cloth masks too) and change them out several times a day to keep my skin happy mostly. They get washed at least 1-2 times a week. The colors are bright and vibrant, it is comfortable to wear for an average sized head. If you know you have a larger or smaller head these will not fit correctly because they aren't adjustable. They have a nice metal nose piece inside the mask, I've washed them in the washing machine and they came out fine. It has multiple layers but no place for a filter. I dont wear a filter in my mask anyway, if I want more protection I just double mask with a surgical mask and cloth mask so that doesn't bother me. I liked the first set so much I bought 2 more. For the price they were a steal when most masks are averaging $10 for 1 right now anyway.",

They are so comfy, easy to breathe in, and I have been getting lots of compliments, even after my 6 months wearing them at work.For glasses wearers:I've looked all over and bought over 5 different pairs that were \"anti-fog\" including these and none have been successful. However, there is something you can get to fix the problem. Yes, there are some masks that work as long as you adjust your glasses to that one little spot and hope they stay there all day but that gets annoying. My suggestion is getting those extended mask holders that go around your neck. I pair those with these masks and I get no fog whatsoever, which is perfect for my 8 hour job days. PLUS, it saves your ears big time!",

I can breath in them the same as my other masks which were homemade by a friend. The space pattern is really cool too! The masks also wash very well... no pilling yet and they keep their color and shape. The only thing that I don't like is that the description says 100% cotton. These are NOT 100% cotton. The inside fabric layer is a stretch cotton knit. The outside is definitely a printed polyester. I don't know what this does for the effectiveness of the mask, but the description needs to be updated. All in all, I'm happy with these.",

                "reviewText": "I am an essential cashier supervisor at a retail store and have to wear a mask for 8-10 hours a day. These are the best masks I\u2019ve found. We have to wear an earpiece attached to a walkie talkie and these masks are the best for not knocking the ear piece off my ear. I\u2019ve tried lots of masks and this style is the most comfortable. The stretchy fabric around their is so much more comfortable than elastic. The soft fabric does not irritate my skin like the paper masks. I live in Texas and these are by far the best for the Texas heat. I wear a mask because I have too and to protect myself and people around me, and believe me I wish I did not have to... but these masks are the best I\u2019ve found. They are breathable, have a nose wire and look good. I\u2019ve received lots of compliments.",

                "reviewText": "This mask is soft and comfortable, but fairly thick and warm. Good for teaching in my outdoor classroom this fall. My students compliment me on the space-themed design - I teach math and physics.I wear glasses and the adjustable nose-bridge is helpful though doesn't completely eliminate fogging. The ear-straps are fairly wide and can get a little annoying towards the end of my day, but if I pay attention to making sure the straps aren't twisted then I do well. The strap fabric is soft. The mask holds shape enough that I can keep it off my lips, which is helpful since I'm speaking a lot in it. When it does get a little damp from speaking, it is also helpful that it stays off my lips and can dry out while I'm wearing it.I wash after each day, and they've held up fine in the initial machine washing/drying cycles. Wish this design came in more patterns!",
