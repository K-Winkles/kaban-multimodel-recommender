                "reviewText": "I have purchased these masks three times before and have always been happy with them until the last time. Previous masks were lightweight, comfortable and fit my face which is a little chubby. I was very surprised earlier this week when I opened a new box order in early 2022 to them to find a very thin mask. I even cut it open to see if there was actually 3 layers because the box doesn't say that and it had all the previous times. There was 3 layers that were very thin. Unfortunately I can't return them as the 30 day period has passed. I didn't bother to open the box when I received them in early 2022 because I had ordered them so many times; lesson learned. I am attaching a picture of previous orders (top of pic) and what I received the last time (bottom) of screen. If you order these make sure you open the box when it is received.",

The mask is made of two pieces of some sort of semi flexible material joined at the \"center.\" This center \"seam\" will split, starting at the bottom, soon after being put on/worn. The ear elastic is also very short which causes it to slip over the ear and the mask to come off or the elastic pulls out of the little slot in which it is held and the mask cannot be used.",
