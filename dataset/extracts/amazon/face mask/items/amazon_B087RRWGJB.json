                "reviewText": "I received this mask before the expected date and am happy with them. The nose piece fits well, the elastic on the ears is rounded and felt comfortable, and it seems they fit closer to my face than other masks. I have one issue with them. Out of the first 5-6 I've used, on 2 of them, the elastic pulled out on one side. I was able to put it back through the hole and tie it and use the mask; however, this could be a problem for someone who didn't have an extra mask on hand or couldn't put it back through the hole. (I used a bobby pin, but a needle threader would have worked best.) Considering the price, quickness of shipment and the mask overall, I am not dissatisfied; however, I think the manufacturer should consider their process to make sure the elastics are held tighter in the masks.",

                "reviewText": "Fit on my adult size head is very good. My glasses don't fog up. Well sealed and I breath very well. I decided to try these after my coworker who was wearing the same Target cotton mask as I did some spray painting and his nostrils and other areas under the mask were black with paint. I really hope manufacturers start making these in a variety of colors. Light gray and tan would be nice. I'll update after I wear these all day at work a couple days.Update: I wore the mask all day at work and I think this is a much better choice than cotton masks. The fit is very good around my face, although it still can work its way off my nose if I talk a lot. I also wore it biking for a few hours today and it was comfortable, I never felt the need to pull it down for better breathing. So far the mask doesn't seem to irritate my face which was a concern, and one thing I considered a plus about cotton masks.Update 2: I've gone through about 20 of my initial case. I don't notice any kind of odd smell when I put on the mask. The only thing I would add to my review is you need to be gentle or the straps can break. Especially if you are wear an earpiece, or glasses with a neck strap(like me). Other than than the strap, these seem well made.I generally wear a mask all day at work & a few of days before replacing it with a new one. I Would buy again.Update: Lowered to four stars due to more straps breaking and some of the masks seem to be shedding material.",

                "reviewText": "These are my absolute favorite surgical masks. I wear these as part of a double-mask setup where I put one of these surgical masks against my face and then place a high quality cloth mask over it. The seal that this combo creates feels nearly as protective as a good quality KN95 mask, but is a bit easier to breathe in, is less wasteful, and less expensive.After trying a couple of other brands of black surgical masks, I\u2019m very happily settled with these. They\u2019re high quality and seem to easily match the quality of the traditional blue surgical masks that I had purchased years ago prior to so many unknown brands flooding the market during the pandemic. They\u2019re just as thick as you expect, and don\u2019t have the plasticy feel that other black surgical masks I\u2019ve tried have. These are incredibly comfortable to wear and fit my face perfectly. There is no gapping on the sides, and the metal nose bridge wire stays in place when I adjust it to fit my nose. The ear loops are soft and comfortable, too, and do not pull uncomfortably on my ears. I\u2019m a 5\u201910\u201d man weighing 160lbs.Unlike my other black surgical masks, these arrive in a nice cardboard box for easy dispensing - just like you\u2019d see in a hospital setting. They\u2019re not individually wrapped, but they\u2019re also not all vacuum sealed together like some of the other, worse, options available.PROS:1) High quality.2) Really comfortable fit.3) Made of soft material.4) Very affordable.5) They look great!CONS:1) None. Really. Buy these!",

                "reviewText": "I prefer the disposable surgical mask style over reusable masks so I don't reuse them or have to wash them. I've been buying masks on and off for a couple of years now and I have to say I like these the best so far. The mask part seems a bit stiffer and heavier than others and the metal nose piece, although not the best I've used, is very good. The ear loops seem to be a bit longer, or maybe the mask is a bit larger, than others and it's very comfortable for my rather large head. The package is almost identical to other brands I've bought, but the manufacturer name was different so I'm guessing they all use the same box template.I plan on sticking with this brand and will be buying another box next month.UPDATE: The ear loops seem to break very often. I usually don\u2019t have problems but people I give a mask to seem to almost always break it.",

                "reviewText": "I've ordered these same surgical masks several times throughout the pandemic, and reordered them again in July of this year. I only opened the box recently and stuck a couple of those in a plastic baggie in my purse along with some others from an earlier order.At first I thought it was me, as sometimes wearing a mask was suddenly uncomfortable and the elastic hurt my ears after a while (when I pulled a *new* one out of the baggie). Finally, I dug out an older model and compared the newer version, and the problem was obvious--the elastic loops are a good quarter inch shorter, and the elastic itself is not as soft and has less give.So, now I need more masks since I can't really use what I have and I don't know what to order now. Hopefully, if I call Amazon they'll be willing to send a replacement with contents that are like what they had been previously, and all will be right with the world!",
