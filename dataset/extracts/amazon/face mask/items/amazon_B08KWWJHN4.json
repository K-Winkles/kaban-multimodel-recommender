Buying the highest quality at the lowest price was my goal..All had familiar problems. Some were too small. Others were hard to breathe. Quality control was a problem with broken straps and metal pieces, that fell off..This product had the least issues. The only annoyance was the scratchy fabric, that produced an occasional minor itch. It was small enough to ignore.",

Then you want to go for N-95 or equivalent.",
