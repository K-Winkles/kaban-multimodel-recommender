Full grown woman, 5'8\", 120 lbs, and I wear a Youth size 7-8 baseball hat. See? Tiny head. All my other masks are very large on me, and by that I mean they cover a lot of my face, basically showing just ears and eyes, and I'm not kidding. These masks probably fit me the way they are supposed to, but they seem really small compared to my other masks because my others are so big. They adjust well to my face. I find after washing them I have to tug on the nose and chin sections to make sure they open up all the way. The fabric is thick and if I adjust them properly there are no gap areas around my face. All in all, I really want to love these, but I don't. 3M, make the center portion of these masks larger. The nose and chin are fine!!",

I really like the design, it is able to be folded and put in your pocket, but I like that it folds to protect the area that touches your face. This is the only mask that I have worn without ripping it off my face as soon as I get in the car.My only complaints is that it is dual layered - which makes it harder to breathe, and I don't believe it makes it any safer. And that it doesn't look as cool as the picture after wearing it and washing it. But it's still able to let me breathe fine, and still cooler looking/better fitting than any other mask I have used.",

Not sure for most adults though.",

Hay un problema de dise\u00f1o en la parte de la barbilla y del puente de la nariz, tienden a esconderse doblarse para adentro y tienes que estar acomodando frecuentemente el cubrebocas, una pregunta frecuente es si tienen \"fierrito\" para ajustar a la nariz y s\u00ed, si lo tienen y se siente de muy buena calidad. Por \u00faltimo el ajuste de las orejas es muy bueno pero si no lo ajustas bien llega a calar y duele bastante no recomiendo que se use muy apretado se pueden lastimar el o\u00eddo con el ajustador.",

I have just the right amount of air coming in and out of the mask.I wear glasses so the idea of it constantly getting steamed up is a concern, not with this product.
