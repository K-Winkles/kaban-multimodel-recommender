                "reviewText": "I picked these up in medium and I'm not quite sure that's my size here. I'm 5'9\" and I think I measured my bridge to chin distance at like 4.75\"? Feels light a slight side of fit. I've been using the LG Airwashers for awhile and I'm super used to their incredibly suffocating design, these kind of gap at the bottom and the nose doesn't snug quite as tight. Knotting the loops helps snug it up, wearing it higher feels more secure. I think overall they're more comfortable, gives some semblance of protection.I don't think these are bad, I like them, though I do still have some concern over level of protection.",
