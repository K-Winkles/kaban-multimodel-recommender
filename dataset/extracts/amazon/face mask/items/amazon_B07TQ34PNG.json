                "reviewText": "I got these facemasks because I'm looking to upgrade my skincare routine big time. These masks are sooooo good! I was a little wary about the whole \"honey\" thing but they aren't sticky like that at all (just in the traditional face mask slimy type of way). The mask itself is super light and the serum inside is so moisturizing. After I put on the mask I still had a lot of serum left over so i just put the rest of it back on my face. Honestly, there's a lot left over but that's a good thing in my book because I can just use the rest of it on my face after the mask has dried out (kinda like a second mask). There's basically no fragrance and my skin felt so good after using it that I immediately bought more. These masks are definitely worth the price ;))",

SoonJung Brand2. Whamisa Organic3. Organic EarthCount this one as top 4 now.I have normal skin, not sensitive and have a good lifestyle, no drinking etc.But I've tried several sheet masks and they all have had some issue one way or another.I'm super sensitive about what ingredients I put on my face and although I'm not 100% cleared on this face mask (lapcos) I give it a safe thumbs up.It works well. Soothes the skin and brightened my complexion back to it's normal state. Broke me out once or twice after using with other products but once my skin got used to it, it was smooth sailing. I only use sheet masks when I really need them or need a pamper session. Pearl is my favorite because it really does add a slight glowing effect. Face feels great after using it, even though most of it is in our heads!",

                "reviewText": "I've tried a lot of sheet masks, and this one easily goes into one of my top five. I love the ingredient list and it truly does feel like honey is on my skin. I tried this one with two of my friends as well, and they both loved it. Our faces were very glowy and hydrated after! It also has a more water-based serum texture to it. In terms of smell, it's light and subtle. I have sensitive skin myself, and it did not cause any reactions.The packaging is very standard for sheet masks. It was easy to unwrap the sheet mask without tearing it. When applying it to my face, it did not crease much and stuck perfectly in place as well. I also feel like because it was so saturated, it didn't dry out while it was on my skin either. There was a lot of leftover serum in the packaging as well that I applied on my neck.Overall, I love how this sheet mask made my skin look and it just felt so luxurious and spa-like. Price wise I feel like they are a little more on the expensive side, but definitely worth it. I think this would be especially good to have for special occasions and when you want to use a sheet mask that you know won't let you down. In the future, I would love to try the Milk and Pearl scents as well.",
