The fabric is thick & keeps his face warm during our cold season rn.So far, the only issue is when I received it & inspected it the fabric in the middle, between the eyes were only held together with a loop of string. It would obviously break so I snipped the string & sew it myself. I love sewing so I didn\u2019t really mind. After fixing it, it\u2019s been great! Sturdy, warm & thick material. He\u2019s very happy with it.",

None of the holes ripped and the seam was tight. If you order and are worried it would be easy to add an extra stitch and avoid buying a super pricy mask- especially as a costume or for special occasions.I did return in because I no longer needed it for a costume I had, but for the price it was a great purchas.Color was as shown on website (baby blue)",
