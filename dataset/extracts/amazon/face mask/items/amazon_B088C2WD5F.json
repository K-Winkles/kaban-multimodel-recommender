Simple design paired with easy on loops allow for easy on and off with the EnerPlex washable face mask. Three Layers of Fabric - Water Resistant Constructed from three layers of high quality fabric, the EnerPlex reusable face mask is water resistant and breathable. The tightly woven middle layer serves to keep out anything floating in the wearer's surroundings, while still allowing for unrestricted breathing. Lay Flat Seams Durable and strong, the mask's lay flat seams, create a snug fit across the bridge of the nose and cheeks, and secure the mask below the chin. The soft materials allow for breathing and talking comfortably while wearing the face mask.",

It sits comfortably and not too tightly off my face, and it's cut perfectly. If I put it on just right, my glasses do not fog and I can breathe. I have worn it on long flights and have felt secure from the coughing and sneezing all around me. I will gladly wear it while teaching because the kids have already forgotten how to sneeze and cough safely! It says that it's washable, and I'll be testing that next. It's sturdy fabric that does not make my nose itch!",

                "reviewText": "The mask are very nice, they fit our faces well from the bridge of our noses all the way to under our chins. And we got some big skulls lolFogging of glasses is minimal & even with my thick beard it\u2019s snug enough to give full coverage. For close to 100% protection, doctors recommend wearing a surgical mask under a cloth one & these are very comfortable with a surgical mask underneath it, even after hours of wear.THEY DO PASS THE FLASHLIGHT TEST WITH ANOTHER SURGICAL MASK! That test is to shine a flashlight through the mask and if you can\u2019t see the light, you have the best protection. If you can see a small bit of light, that\u2019s okay too but if you\u2019re able to add another layer without compromising your breathing, doctors suggest you do so.The only reason I\u2019m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I ordered the 3 pack large mask, but only 2 were consistent in size. The 3rd mask was a tiny bit smaller, kinda like a medium large, not a large large. With some adjusting on the face, it fits just fine but it\u2019s not exact like the other 2 large mask I got.I wish I could give 4.5 stars instead of 4 because this is something minor & probably only occurs 1 out of 100,000 orders. I will still buy again though.Stay safe, y\u2019all!",

                "reviewText": "These masks are very well made and durable, the price is worth it for the quality if that\u2019s making you think twice. The designer of this mask should get an award. I can\u2019t get over how perfectly this conforms to my face (5\u20192 adult woman, wearing the Medium size) yet doesn\u2019t feel stifling or sweltering. Breathing is totally natural. It doesn\u2019t shift or get annoying and hasn\u2019t aggravated my skin or left indents on my face. Other masks have left me sweaty and gross and caused horrible breakouts for me but not this one. I like the fabric that is on the outer facing side as well because lint and debris doesn\u2019t stick to it and stray hairs are easily brushed off.I wear a mask 8+ hours a day due to my job, which is also a very active job (on my feet all day, rushing to and fro, constantly moving my arms, bending down, kneeling, reaching, working in both hot and freezing environments with heavy lifting for part of it) so it\u2019s important that a mask is breathable and comfortable. It doesn\u2019t fog up my glasses or ride up my nose and interfere with the bridge of the glasses like some other masks do. It\u2019s pretty comfortable on my ears as well (and fits comfortably even with the glasses arms perched on my ears, some other mask ear loops get in the way) and I have yet to have the elastic snap/break.I handwash these masks and they air dry very quickly. I put one in the washing machine and dryer by accident and it DID shrink - the manufacturer recommends against the washing machine and dryer for a reason!I ended up buying a bunch of these masks because they are so far the most perfect for me that I have found. I would recommend them to anyone but ESPECIALLY if: 1) you need to wear one while being fairly active for extended periods and 2) you wear glasses because it can be hard to find a comfortable mask that is compatible with glasses.",

On the images provided it shows the purchaser how to select the most accurate size for your needs. What I found unclear was aligning the children\u2019s sizes with the adult sizes. The children\u2019s mask image gave a description based on size and measurement and word labelling that didn\u2019t match the options available when clicking on purchase so I selected the medium (which was the second size from the smallest). I assumed that the medium matched the second size up in the children\u2019s masks. The mediums came in and fit quite well for the adults in the home (a tad big for doable) but were too big for my child. I then ordered the small size. The size of the masks were a bit smaller and work with a bit of knotting in the ear loops. The loop elastic material is much thinner and more flimsy in the small masks than the medium masks. I must have ordered both sizes as adult masks. In terms of comfort the masks are amazing! They are soft and conform very nicely to the face. They are easy to wear for long periods of time. Great for those with sensitive skin! They wash well and maintain their shape. I purchased them because of the reviews. I would purchase them again.",

I wear glasses, so I put a paper clip in the top of the lining and bent it around my nose and my glasses don't fog up. I find the masks look nice, are breathable, and comfy. I'm glad I went for the smaller size, as I think the larger size would have been too big for my face.My only con is, the mask kind of has too much space in the front and looks pointy like a beak. To be honest, these are my first re-usable masks so I'm not sure if that's normal or not. Personally, I don't really mind it.",
