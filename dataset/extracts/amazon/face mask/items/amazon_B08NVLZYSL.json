                "reviewText": "My Costco is out of black masks, which is why I ordered these. They are a few dollars more than Costco's, but they are also individually wrapped, which is nice. I can toss a few in my bag or car and not worry about keeping them clean.The quality of these is great. None of them have broken on me so far, and the nose wire is secure in the mask. These are a bit smaller than Costco's black masks, so they fit a bit tighter (which I like, since Costco's were a bit loose on me).Only minor downside is that they fit snuggly against the undereye area, which can be slightly uncomfortable, but I don't mind it much. I'd rather my mask be snug than loose.",

                "reviewText": "Like millions of parents this year, we were dreading sending out children to school wearing a mask all day. I bought many different kinds or cloth masks and was so nervous because my child didn\u2019t want to keep them on. I saw these and loved the fact that they are individually wrapped so we can just pack extra in the backpack without them getting dirty. Also, not having to keep up with mask laundry is AMAZING. Gave them a shot, and wow, we are so impressed!! My 5 year old wears it all day at kindergarten and says it\u2019s comfortable and she forgets she\u2019s even wearing it. Thank goodness! For anyone that is struggling with worry about their child being able to breathe easily in a mask, I highly recommend trying these! I would say one of out of ten break during the day, not too shabby.",

They fit under the blue one very nicely when I double mask now with omicron.",

                "reviewText": "We bought these for our kids (12, 10, 9, 6, 4) for a road trip/ vacation to Disney. They were comfortable for the entire day- no complaints about ears hurting or feeling like they were too thick.The masks are all individually wrapped, which I prefer because then I can have extras on hand. I have given masks to random people that have forgotten theirs and it's always nice to hand a wrapped one so that it's obviously unused.The fit: We had to twist the loops for the 4 year old, the mask was a little big and so it would slide down under her nose (side note- Disney was strict, but very kind about the masks); my kiddo with sensory processing disorder didn't mind the feel/ fit; the ear loops are stretchy enough that the masks even work for me (adult with a small/ medium head)!Durability: the kids started wearing these around 9:30a and we had some of them get new ones after a late lunch (2:30) only because we have some kids that chew/ lick their masks (so. gross!) We also had a kiddo get a new mask around 6p because he got a bloody nose (extra nasty!)... We have only had 2 masks where earloops have ripped off, but I'm pretty sure there was some foul play involved... I have had cheap disposable masks where the nose wire has ripped out, so based on the price, I was concerned that would happen with these. However we haven't had that issue at all. These have held up nicely!The only con for me is that if you have cheeto or chocolate fingers (or a bloody nose) it will show up on the white mask. (If you have chocolate all over your mouth, it will not show through though.)We were surprised with the quality, especially considering the price! We will be buying these again!",

I bought quickly because the photo looks just like the same brand of the children\u2019s individually packed masks. They\u2019re sort of flimsy too. Feels like it\u2019s not as thick and protective as others I have ordered in the past.",
