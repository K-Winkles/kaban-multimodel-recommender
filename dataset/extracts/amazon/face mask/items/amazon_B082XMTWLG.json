They were hassle free and made no mess. Rip the seal, pull out mask, unfold and apply to face. Simple! These are perfect as a treat to yourself or great as part of a gift.",

                "reviewText": "These face masks are the best I've purchased thus far! They're thicker then most and are soaked with nourishment for your skin. After I dermaroll, I use these masks and my skin feels so amazing after and you can see the difference in your skin versus using other facemasks that don't! I highly recommend this product to everyone including my family, friends and ppl who want to feel what I do after using this product. I do these reviews cause I care and want people to know exactly what it does and how it worked and I want you to reap the same benefits as I. A Lil \ud83d\udcdd Do NOT order Dermarollers that don't say real needles on the box!! No real dermaroller has more then 192 needles for the face. The fake ones come apart easily and look like little circular saws. While using them, they rip your skin apart and will leave scars after multiple uses! Please do your research before you purchase any dermaroller products. Talk to an esthetician who knows, not just a seller who is trying to make money. They may use them but they don't know anything about the skin. I purchase my dermarollers from gin AmberShe bought her 1st dermaroller on Amazon as did I and we met on YouTube discussing fake dermarollers and the damage they do to your skin. She's an esthetician and teaches all about this and she made her own dermaroller to help because of all the fake ones being sold out there and she wanted ppl to be able to get a real dermaroller cause she genuinely cares about our skin. Have a beautiful day everyone. I'm so sorry for such a long review. Happy Halloween, Be safe out there Trick or treating. Take care of yourselves \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this brand of paper masks for a while now, and they recently updated the design and packaging. These new masks are absolutely awesome and it looks like they tried to upgrade their quality immensely. The most noticeable thing about them is that they now use a really thick, soft, cotton-like paper. I have to admit I'm not too crazy about that part as it makes it harder to fit under my silicone cover, but I get how it helps keep the mask wetter for a longer period of time. I just don't need that function due to using the silicone cover for the purpose of preventing liquid from evaporating. If you are using a silicone mask cover and are using these for the first time, you may want to buy the old design first - it's still being sold on Amazon, though for how long I don't know..Every mask has the primary ingredient mixed with an emollient solution designed to deeply quench your skin and moisturize it... which helps relax and loosen fine lines and wrinkles so you can then seal the results in with a face cream or face oil. They don't treat wrinkles or fine lines - they JUST moisturize and nourish the skin. I try to use it twice a week, though sometimes it's more like once a week. I have sensitive skin but have not had any issues with the formula in these masks irritating my skin. If you keep them in the fridge, they are really relaxing to use after a long day.",
