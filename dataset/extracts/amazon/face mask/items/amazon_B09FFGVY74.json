            "Upgraded Material for Better Protection - TOPMAX KN95 face maks adopt the electrostatic polarization precessed 2-layers of meltblown fabric, it has a higher absorbing ability and filtration efficiency than traditional disposable masks. The tested filter efficiency of this KN95 mask is >95%.",
            "More Breathable KN95 Masks - Compared with other masks that have to increase thickness to achieve the required filtration efficiency, ours can be lighter and thinner while ensuring the filtration effect. The electrostatic polarization processed meltblown fabric will spontaneously absorb the tiny particles (less than 0.0005mm) around them, so it has higher filtration efficiency with the same thickness.",
            "Fits Most Users' Faces - The face masks can properly fit most users' faces since we designed them regarding the average face shape of Americans. Designed in a 3D shape, you will have a larger breathing space while wearing the face mask. Meanwhile, the design reduces the uncomfortable feeling of heat and humidity, making wearing masks a more pleasant experience.",
            "Adjustable Nose Clip Tightly Fit Face - We embedded an invisible metal adjustable nose clip in the nose bridge of the mask, which makes the face mask tightly fit different face shapes. Besides, the design can effectively block the direct entry of unfiltered air from outside. For users wearing glasses, it will prevent glasses from being fogged up by breathing.",

I wanted some black masks that I could use and dispose of as needed, and this is a good price for 50 masks.These are labeled KN95, which I believe is what's been recommended for the non-medical professional (me).The only issue is the ear straps are kind of short. I have a fairly average-sized face; I don't usually need larger-sizes of masks, but after wearing these awhile they start to hurt my ears.They're also a little itchy on the inside, sometimes, because of how soft and, I don't know how to describe it, \"hairy\" the inside material is on some of these. It's not a huge issue but sometimes your nose will itch.I solved both of the previous problems by doubling this mask with some of the fabric masks we've been acquiring over the years. I put the fabric mask on the inside and loop the ear straps together (see photos) so they both stay on my face and it doesn't pull on my ears or itch my nose. I recommend this method.",
