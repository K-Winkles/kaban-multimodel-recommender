They\u2019re very light weight and easy to breathe through. And you really can\u2019t beat the value for money aspect. 100 masks for a great price. I\u2019ll always have a mask when I need it. I keep half in my car and the other half in random places. And I don\u2019t have to worry about washing them. Just throw the old/used ones away. And remember!! Don\u2019t litter them!!",

                "reviewText": "A light, thin mask. It's very affordable, and the bulk pack (2 bags of 50 bulk-stacked in a single box) is as enviro-friendly packaging as you can get for a throw-away plastic product.That design is meant to be single-use and obviously not as protective as a heavier mask or KN95. But the comfort of the non-structued mask (and low-price) are good for low-risk situations or where there's a mask mandate but low transmission numbers. People with high-risk conditions should not depend on these masks for protection.The problem with all these masks sold by various importers is they vary a LOT from batch to batch, manufacturing sources changing, etc. Other reviews complained about the ear loops breaking, but I instead found they were a little too tight on my large-ish head (XL hat size), so I'm keeping on looking. That variability and the plastic waste are the biggest issues here.Otherwise, fine for light protection on medium sized heads.",
