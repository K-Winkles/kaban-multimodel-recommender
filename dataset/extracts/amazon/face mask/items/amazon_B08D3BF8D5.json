                "reviewText": "These are great!My family had been using a number of masks with the same stretchy ear band masks like these (our other orders luckily came individually sealed so we could carry single ones anywhere to hand out or wear ourselves, but it was no longer on sale).In just one day, 2 friends (who are great cleaners) asked me how and where I got them. They wear then non stop from early morning till night and have so many variations of different types. But they thought how comfortable these looked. The single elastic string types, they said were uncomfortable behind their ears.And then same day, when I was accompanying a family member to a doctor's appointment, 2 of the staff members begged us to share where and how to get them. We just answered, \"Amazon\", and they each said they'd rush to find and order them right after work.So, for my cleaner friends, I leapt online. Found awesome bargain of these other ones $2.49. I was psyched. Ordered, gave each a box. Female friend said perfect. Male friend unfortunately could not even fit it over his head. Has rounder, larger face. (And turned out same exact thing for my father! Wouldn't fit him until he stretched it out for some time.)So, I was given the box back. I came online to try to find STRETCHY ear loops. The seller was very prompt and confirmed with me that they would definitely fit larger faced men and that it is quick stretchy.Bingo! Got it, received in a couple of days. Brought to friend who loved it so much, he's been wearing them every day! He thanked me so kindly. Made my day!Though $4.99, was double price of cheap ones, but these I would definitely purchase again. No individual wrapping, but I trust it, as they are packaged very compact and machine folded in, with straps stuck gently on either side, to confirm brand new.I highly recommend these. :)",

I really like the wider ear loops, they are more comfortable, stretchy but strong. I have, for over a yr now, ordered masks that had the thin ear loops and have had quite a few break on me. I liked these so well I ordered two boxes of 50. I don't think you will be disappointed. Just wanted to add, the ear loops, when first pulled out to open, looked small, but pull them again n they will open wider, actually, you can pull them out 3 times. I'm not in the least disappointed. I will buy them again, if needed.",

                "reviewText": "Since March 2020 I've purchased more masks than I care to admit but finally found this one and I like it. I wear eyeglasses and the elastic type ear loops of this mask are comfortable with my glasses. It is contoured well to fit my face, light weight but thick enough to offer protection, and as comfortable as masks can be. After all, no one enjoys wearing a mask, but I refuse to endanger anyone else for my comfort so I'm doing my bit (with minimal whining).",

I had some black ones that had a vague smell. I have a wide round face and my husband has a long narrow face; we both find it comfortable and get full coverage. These will be my re-order masks.",
