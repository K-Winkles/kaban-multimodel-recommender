                "reviewText": "These Korean Face Masks are great & easy to use! The mask is thin & made of cotton. It\u2019s nice they are paraben & sulfate free. There is a scent of honey to each so if you\u2019re fragrance sensitive I\u2019d stay away. The 12 different varieties are wonderful to treat different needs of my skin. I found each to be beneficial. I make sure my skin is fully cleansed & while a little damp I apply the mask. It goes on smoothly & adheres. I let it sit for 15 minutes & it peels off super easy. I feel the dampness of my skin is the key after using a couple. My skin feels moisturized & refreshed! I\u2019ve seen improvement in the tone & texture of my skin after using all 12. I\u2019ll be purchasing again. 12 masks for $9.49 using subscribe & save is a great price with the quality & benefits each provide. I definitely recommend!",
