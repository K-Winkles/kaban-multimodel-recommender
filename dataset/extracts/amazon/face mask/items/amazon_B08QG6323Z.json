                "reviewText": "I never leave reviews but I have to for this product! My daughter is two (born winter of 2018) and I have had the hardest time finding masks that fit her. I feel as if I\u2019ve tried literally everything and it\u2019s a constant struggle to keep the mask from riding up into her eyes, or coming off one ear, or both! It\u2019s so annoying to having to manually make loops on standard kids masks for each side of the mask to make it fit tight enough to prevent it from not falling off completely. These masks fit flawlessly! Best masks I\u2019ve found! No weird order, they don\u2019t break, and best of all: my daughter loves them and finds them comfortable! There is not a single thing I can find to dislike. They are great for toddlers who chewOn masks or get them wet when wearing as well because they\u2019re disposable! I think part of the reason for a toddler messing with their mask is that theyDon\u2019t fit properly and in a time of Covid proper mask wearing is not something I\u2019m willing to mess around with when out or around others with my daughter. I would recommend these masks to any parent and I think I ideally they fit age 2-4",

                "reviewText": "The only brand so far for little ones that we've found of amazing quality are the Halyard ones, but they're impossible to find, since they mostly equip hospitals. I've tried other kids ones and they are all uncomfortable, too big, and the ear loops tear right off almost immediately! Just Play makes a great smaller-sized mask but they are ridiculously expensive. I decided to try these because I found out Dr. Talbot's are manufactured by Nuby, a brand I've trusted for over 9 years. They are AWESOME! My 9 and 5 year old were able to make it through the entire 8 and 9 hour school days in them without the loops tearing off, and with them fitting perfectly on both of their faces! Even my 9 year-old, who is very tall for his age fits the size small better then the other brands. I recommend these for parents who are trying to keep their kids safe all day long.",

Emphasize on this listing because other listings are false advertising the masks pictured second and third. Other sellers are clearly false labeling for ages 2-5 and as you can see from the packaging these are for ages 4-12 and 6-12.The masks pictured first are of this listing. These masks are definitely size appropriate, light weight, and comfortable. However the price for only 10 masks is too expensive.",
