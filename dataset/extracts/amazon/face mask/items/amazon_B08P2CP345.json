                "reviewText": "These are definitely a \"family pack\" with both light & dark colors. I'll be giving away the 2 darkest colors to men. I love the 3 lighter colors. They are still reasonably priced (with me using only 15 out of 25). I love that they have EAR loops, which are much faster & easier to use, especially getting on & off (avoiding) a thick head of hair. The masks fit well enough for the way I use them, not going to crowded places, keeping safe distances at grocery & pet food stores, and staying home more than ever these days.The only drawback, imo, is the innermost layer which is NOT as soft as any other of the (made in China) KN95 masks I have purchased from other brands in stores. So I don't wear the Dolce Calma masks for more than an hour at a time, because they are a bit \"scratchy\" on my face/nose.",
