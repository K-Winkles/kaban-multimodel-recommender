                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the black mask, and I'm impressed with the results. The mask effectively removed impurities and left my skin feeling refreshed. Unlike other masks, it didn't cause any discomfort during application or removal. A little goes a long way, making it a cost-effective choice. Overall, a great addition to my skincare routine!ConsWhile the black mask I purchased had positive aspects, there were a couple of drawbacks. Firstly, the strong scent upon application might be overwhelming for some users with sensitivity to fragrances. Additionally, the peeling process, though effective, required a bit of patience and precision to avoid any discomfort. Overall, these cons are worth considering alongside the mask's benefits.",

I ended up using far more than necessary as well due to the poor fit (they'd slip) and the lesser quality had me doubling up in certain settings. These masks, that I'm now rating, are of noticeably higher quality - they grip the nose well, which greatly helps with keeping them in place, and are far more comfortable than the ones prior.

                "reviewText": "I give a 3 star on receiving the product, but will update if needed. They are very thin and material feels rough. Reading reviews it is apparent that products made in China change regularly with no regard for quality control. On May 9th, 2022 I received very thin masks with black on both sides. I prefer a white back so you know which is front and back. Some people complain about the pleats being upside down. That only applies if there is a definite front and back. If both sides are the same, you just turn the mask over. Ear loops are round so they may be uncomfortable? After using for a while I will know if the ear loops are ok, and whether the mask is rough or leaves fuzz. There is a slight odor when you first put them on. Overall this product is not reliable as it seems to vary regularly according to the reviews, so a buyer has no idea what they will really receive. Can Amazon not find masks made in a country who believes in quality control?",
