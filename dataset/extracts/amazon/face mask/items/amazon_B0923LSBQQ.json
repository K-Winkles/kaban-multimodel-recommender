                "reviewText": "WEARING ONE RIGHT NOW AS I WRITE THIS! The first, and really only, masks to ACTUALLY change the look and feel of my skin. After I bought a Christmas special 3 pack from Target (gifted two, kept one) I was obsessed. I looked online after the holidays to try to order more for myself and they were sold out! I thought maybe they weren't getting the two I liked best in again (aloe and moisture surge) so I just decided to order this super pack on Amazon and I'm so glad I did! I genuinely have liked all of them, but my favorites are still the aloe and moisture surge. If you want a special vitamin c or niacinamide mask by this brand, check out Target. But if you like them all and want to try them all, this is the way to go! Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "These are thin so it has a plastic sheet that you remove after you put it on your face.I really like that its thin just like many Korean brand masks. A lot of other brands masks are thick which makes it difficult to fully stick to the face without air pockets or when it starts to dry, the mask starts to lift. This mask being thin helps to adhere to the skin better so the product is evenly distributed.I would apply the excess essence onto the face before putting the mask on. If there is still extra essence, I would apply it to my body.Aside from the individual benefits of each mask, they all made my skin feel hydrated and smooth.It\u2019s a good price point and with positive benefits, I would recommend!",
