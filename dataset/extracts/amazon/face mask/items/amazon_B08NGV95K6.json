You can wear it but mostly without glasses/sunglasses, they fog up and is a little uncomfortable but that's ok, it works. It was a little difficult to breathe but I also don't like things on my face. It gets the job done, really good product.",

It seemed a bit loose until I washed it, then it fitted my face much better with just minimal shrinkage. We'll see how it holds up on the ski slopes! I'm very happy with this purchase so far!",

                "reviewText": "It's advertised as being windproof, but other than the strip of material on the front between the eyes and bottom it is not windproof or even wind resistant. The fleece is reasonably thick and provides plenty of warmth, but 85% of this mask has no wind resistance. It also too thick to wear with a motorcycle helmet unless you have a second helmet that's a size too large. Also, I'm 6 feet and 225 pounds, no one would describe my head as small but this is very loose on me, I think it's sized for Sasquatch. For warmth it gets an A, but for sizing and wind resistance it gets a D.",
