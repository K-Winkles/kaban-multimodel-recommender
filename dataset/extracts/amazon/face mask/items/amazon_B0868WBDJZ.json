                "reviewText": "My favorite part about this mask is how quickly it arrived. On my doorstep the morning of the fifth day. I\u2019ve placed orders for other masks, cloth and paper, that have either not yet arrived or took over two months to arrive.The quality of the masks are notable. They are the standard \u201cface mask blue\u201d. They are of the same quality I receive each morning at the healthcare facility I work in (cloth masks not allowed in patient care settings). The masks are soft, but durable. There is a metal nose piece to conform to the bridge of your nose. The elastic bands loop over your ear and don\u2019t rub the top of ears. They appear to stretch out pretty well, but I have a smaller face so I cannot speak to the comfort of wearing a stretched mask for long periods of time. I\u2019ve used some masks that suck into your mouth when you open mouth breath or talk. That is annoying. These do not do that. They are sturdier. They will move down off your nose if you laugh or yawn. I haven\u2019t met a mask yet that can handle that.The material is pretty soft. With other masks I see the pointed corners in my periphery because of the way the loops are attached to the mask. These masks are not different. It\u2019s not bad, just a thing to note.The lifespan of the mask says 2 years, but I do not know if that\u2019s the expiration date for the mask or the length of time you can actively use a mask. Neither answer makes sense to me. Masks should be changed as often as underwear from what I understand.For those interested, the box indicates \u201cmade in China\u201d, \u201cproduced\u201d by an organization in China, but \u201cmanufactured for and distributed by\u201d a Hayward, California company. These do NOT say anything about being latex-free so I would assume the ear loops contain latex.If you must use a paper mask, these are on the nicer end of the spectrum. For about 87 cents per mask. Worth a try for sure!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable Disposable Mask Option",
                "reviewText": "I sew and have made several hundred fabric masks for friends and family before disposable medical grade fabric masks were available. My focus was on having sufficient layers, fabric for comfort and fit for the individual. The CandyCare mask, even though made in China, hits all the marks and gives me an equivalent level of comfort when I have to be around others.The mask uses standard medical grade fabric for 3-layer coverage and the 3 center pleats allows it to expand for full frontal facial coverage. Held up to a light, it lets some light pass through so it's not as dense as N95's or even some fabric masks - especially those with filter inserts. However, the fabric is soft, non irritating and much more comfortable and breathable than many of the fabric masks I have made. I tend to reach for one of the CandyCare masks now before one of my fabric masks as they have to be washed after each use so convenience for those that have to go out more often is a plus.Fit is not ideal for all individuals. The CandyCare mask fits my medium size face pretty well with just a little gap on each side but while out in public, I sometimes forget I have it on. They expand sufficiently to give a good fit under the chin. The only down side is that they only come in one-size and would fit a larger face better - smaller faces might have a bigger gap. Because I sew, this is a quick fix with a small stitch on each side to close the gap. The mask fits securely under my glasses even though like most masks, my glasses tend to fog occasionally - if they didn't I would worry they were not giving enough coverage. The metal strip is excellent and provides the ability to contour it around the nose for a secure \"comfortable\" fit. The ear loops are also soft and more comfortable for longer use than elastic ones used for fabric masks.The biggest comfort I have with using this mask is that my daughter is a medical professional and says they are comparable to those issued to her at the hospital for use in non-patient areas. They were delivered quickly and come sealed in a plastic wrap. Would have been nice if the wrap was resealable, but I moved them to a zip lock to keep them germ free.",

                "reviewText": "Mask fits comfortably and you can breathe easily, very easily. Too easily, which made me doubt whether it serves its purpose or not. I could very very easily blow out a candle while wearing this mask, so I will not use it to protect my life with it.Box notes a bunch of specs but ad also says it is not for medical use. Okay, I'm not in the medical field. But I thought it ought to prevent air (and therefore germs) from going from my mouth to others, and others air to me. So if the air goes so easily as to blow out a candle, I don't want my life blown out by using this to protect me when I'm in the proximity of people.July 12, 2020 edit:I write honest and unbiased opinions of the products I choose to write about. I do this because it is the right thing to do - not because someone sent the product to me at no cost to me. Please know that this product was sent to me to try at no cost to me, and yet, I wrote the review I did.However, since I wrote the review (above), and responded to comments; others have written to me and some have sent other products to test and try at no cost to me. While trying these other products, I also found the same results - regarding the candle. However this mask, unlike 2 others I was asked to try, has three layers in this mask's assembly (vs. two layers in the other masks); which leads me to believe that this mask is probably better at stopping harmful substances from being exchanged. Of course, I'm not a scientist with sophisticated equipment to test this, but do feel 3 filter layers are better than 2. In light of this, I have revised my review, not to delete what I've already said; but to move it from a negative rating to a positive one (albeit, not the highest one because this mask is not approved for medical use - highest level of protection); and yet, appreciative of the manufacturer and sellers honesty that it is not meant for medical use. So I conclude that in light of what is currently available out in the marketplace, this is a good general use, disposable mask.",
