                "reviewText": "I think I have an average sized head compared to other family members so the mask fits just fine size wise; but I did find that the part that goes over your nose does tend to slip down more than other masks I have and this could be do to there being less material. I fixed this by putting the bottom part of the mask on the edge of my chin rather than under my chin and with a bit of stubble that works for me; however with a clean shaven face not sure if the part I put on my chin wouldn't also slip down there by allowing the nose part to slip down again. Overall I think this is a nice option if you need a mask to put on and take off on a regular basis having it always handy; although the other option is to buy some face mask lanyards to use with any mask. The one thing I can add to buying this item over using a lanyard along with another mask is that this does not tend to pull on your ears (or at least is more adjustable) compared to face masks with stretchy ear loops. My final verdict is you really have to try it but if you tend to have a large head when wearing hats for example this probably isn't going to fit size wise unless they come out with a larger version.",

                "reviewText": "One size does NOT fit all! A seven year old might be able to wear the masks we received, but not an average adult! We are not large people, but they were too small for all of us. Also, upon closer inspection we found that one side of the masks had been cut 1/2\" narrower and 1/4\" shorter than the other side of the mask. This resulted in the mask pulling to one side and not covering our faces as we moved or talked. It kept moving up covering nose and lips but not the chin. Pulling it down over the chin resulted in it slipping down off the nose a few minutes later. The center seam was also off from the top peak. The fabric was very thin allowing for light to filter through. They did label the box as \"not for covid use\" so guess that was to be expected. We were so disappointed with this product that we returned the unopened box and will probably toss the ones we tried on. This is the worst product we have ever gotten from Amazon! Total waste of money in this covid time! Would not even give it a 1 star if that option was available. Also, no more Copper Fit products for me.",

I am a six foot seven man so I am used to things fitting a little small when they have a generic sizing but these masks also did not fit on my wife who is 5,' 7\".Please be aware that sizing of masks is important to be effective. I would not recommend these masks for most adults. It would be nice if there was a larger size option. I may even take the two masks provided and reconstruct them into a single larger mask because I like the mechanism with the loop and lanyard.",
