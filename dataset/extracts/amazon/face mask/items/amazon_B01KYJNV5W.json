As others have mentioned, the eye slits are separated by a stitch not really well centered, so one opening was larger than the other. No biggie until another cheap feature kicked in; the material doesn't breathe well, so when shoveling thick snow I began to sweat. The sweat made the smaller eye slit slide, and the thicker edge kept poking in my eye. I chose to cut the center stitch so now there is a single wide opening for both eyes.Later on I used it for a leisurely walk where I didn't sweat and it all felt better.Later yet I found the good balaclava, so I doubt I will ever use this again.",

The eye holes and the mouth holes are comically irregular, to the point where they actually have their own facial expressions. That's okay though. I bought them for the sole purpose of putting them over my headrests to use as a headrest cover. The fact that the quality of these masks are totally messed up makes it perfect for what I bought them for. My headrests now have facial expressions. \ud83e\udd23 However, if I were to use these for their intended purpose, I'd be giving a much lower rating because they're definitely crappy-made masks. I can't get over how bad the eye holes and mouth holes are. \ud83d\ude02",
