My face is red afterwards as well, which isn't appealing, but expected after pulling this mask off. The first picture of my face is before the mask the second one (where its really red) is after. I feel like my face looks fresher and my pours clearer. I did use the tree tea oil after, as well as a vitamin c oil, collagen oil, and a retinal oil as well and a moisturizer after peeling the mask. I would recommend... but please beware! It hurts peeling it off!",

                "reviewText": "I almost did not purchase this product due to the bad reviews but I decided to go ahead and give it the benefit of the doubt and try it for myself and here is what I found.As you can see in the picture it does leave some redness behind (I have sensitive skin), my cheeks are a little tingly and a bit itchy but overall just fine and they feel sooo soft now. Also the tingling and itchiness subsides after about 10 minutes.You must follow the directions precisely. In them it says, use on areas with blackheads and large pores. I take this to mean do not use it on your entire face and leave the more sensitive areas of your face out when you apply this mask. As you can see, my chin is of normal coloration while my cheeks are a bit red, this is because my cheek skin is more sensitive than my chin skin.Side note, I left it on for about 35 minutes total, I would not suggest leaving it on for any longer than that. If it still isn't dry after that amount of time, you've applied too thick of a layer.And lastly the directions say to use a thin layer, literally as much as you need to cover the skin without seeing it through the mask is enough. It did not remove every single blackhead but it removed about 90% of them and I could have left a warm cloth on longer than I did.So overall this product is good, the tea tree oil is very soothing and makes your skin feel softer. The mask itself works if you use it properly and don't leave it on for too long. It did not hurt my face at all when I peeled it off, I would assume the people having issues with pain and skin rashes and skin coming off have used way too thick of a layer than they should have and possibly left it on too long. Another possibily is an allergic reaction to a chemical in the product.I gave this product 4 stars because it does it's job but does leave redness in sensitive areas. My face, being sensitive is already prone to redness and it is not severe in any way so I believe it will fade very quickly.",

                "reviewText": "I recently tried the SHVYOG Blackhead Peel Off Face Mask, and it's an okay product, in my opinion. Here's what I found:1. **Effective Blackhead Removal**: The mask did a decent job of removing some blackheads and impurities from my skin. It left my face feeling somewhat smoother.2. **Convenient Set**: I appreciated that it came with a brush and tea tree oil serum. The brush made application easier, and the serum added a nice touch to my skincare routine.3. **Peel-Off Experience**: The peel-off process was relatively painless, and I didn't experience any discomfort while removing the mask.However, I did have a few concerns:1. **Limited Results**: While it did remove some blackheads, I didn't see a significant improvement in my skin's overall texture or clarity. It didn't fully meet my expectations in terms of addressing blackheads and impurities.2. **Scent**: The mask has a strong scent that I found a bit overpowering. It might not be suitable for those with sensitivity to scents.3. **Messy Application**: Despite the brush, the application process can still get messy. It's important to apply it evenly to avoid uneven peeling.In conclusion, the SHVYOG Blackhead Peel Off Face Mask is an okay option if you're looking for a basic blackhead removal product with added convenience. While it did provide some results, it didn't entirely meet my skincare expectations. It might work better for individuals with less stubborn blackheads or those looking for a simple addition to their skincare routine.",

It's easy to apply and dries fairly quickly, making the experience convenient and hassle-free.The best part? It effectively removes blackheads and leaves my skin feeling incredibly smooth and refreshed. The peel-off process is oddly satisfying, and I can see the gunk it pulls out from my pores. It doesn't irritate my skin and doesn't leave any residue behind.For anyone looking to address blackheads and improve the overall texture of their skin, this face mask is a fantastic choice. It's an affordable and effective way to achieve cleaner, smoother skin. I'm definitely making it a regular part of my skincare routine. High recommendation!",
