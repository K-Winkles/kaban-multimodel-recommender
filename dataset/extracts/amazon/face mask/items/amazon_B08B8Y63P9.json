They fit good and were breathable but each one has broken a few mins/hours into wearing. I was hoping for the price they would be decent quality and last her a while but not when she has to change them 4-5 times a day because the keep breaking\u2026 very disappointed!!",

                "reviewText": "Ordered my masks June 19, 2020, sold and shipped by Amazon (then). They arrived 10 days later.Product seems generic. Box has picture of medical personnel and is labeled \"Disposable Face Masks ~ Bacterial Filtration Efficiency (BFE) > 95%\" (maybe trying to latch onto \"N95\" fame?). Nothing about Hannah Linen or country of origin. Company name is \"medipro supply\" and \"makeursati-supply-inc.com\" with a Brooklyn NY address. Inside the box is a resealable plastic bag with both Chinese and English writing, including \"This product is non-medical device.\" Manufacturer name is in Chinese writing. Inside that is a sealed plastic bag with the masks inside. Also a small paper \"Qualified Certificate\" with both Chinese and English writing, including production date 2020/4/18.The mask itself appears to be standard for its type (I've used two others). I verified it was breathable material by holding it tightly to my face and inhaling and exhaling for a minute or so. The fit and dimensions are about the same but the ear loops took a bit more effort to attach, caused by the elastic not being as \"stretchy\" as the others. I put on and took off the mask multiple times but elastic didn't loosen up. Another difference is the metal nose piece, which seems to be of thinner material than the others, but it does work. Overall, these are usable for my purpose, which is to meet masking requirements during the COVID-19 lockdown.Please note: given the generic nature of the product, I don't know that you will receive what I did.",

                "reviewText": "Nice appearance, soft to face, fits well, I have a heart shaped face, elastic is stretchy. they MIGHT be resueable a few times if one follows the CDC guidelines of palcing seperately in a paper bag and let sit in a warm place two days to inactivate the virus if you are purchasing them for COVID. However, i will be using them in a lecture lab situation which is fully opened but has the number of students cut in half for social distancing and will be continuously be masked both students and faculty. I will OBVIOUSLY, for the students, dispose of them at the end of a lecture / lab cycle to model proper protocol for use and disposal. There are fifty per pack and I will use two for one day so will be able to cover 25 lecture / lab days . I plan to reorder another package. In terms of appearance, they appear \"soft\" and have a very slight \"texture\" but not very much. Should look very \"professional\" with my normal attire of a black suit and white shirt or white lab coat that is washed daily. Highly recommended.",
