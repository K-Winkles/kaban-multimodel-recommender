                "reviewText": "These masks are wonderful. We previously purchased some that had the same length listed for the ear loops. However, the previous ones were tight, hurt my ears, and usually popped off my ears every time I talked. These are much better though. The mask fits great on my face, and the ear loops are just a bit more flexible than others, allowing a more comfortable fit.",

                "reviewText": "I really have been enjoying this style more than I expected.Nose bridge holds very securely and does not have such flimsy metal as in the other types.I feel that I\u2019m able to breathe more easily with a stiff shaped mask of this nature and at first did not realize I would prefer it to the other styles as I had worked in surgical nursing and I have never tried this shape before.The ear loop elastic is very thick and comfortable and I find for me it\u2019s sized more appropriately it\u2019s not so loose like the others.They look a bit more sort of minimalist clean lined and in my opinion slightly more fashionable than the folded flat types. And it holds tighter to the face and feels more protective to me than the cloth ones despite the statistics...I feel they are high enough quality rating for wearing out to walk my dog to the bathroom etc. and to out on short errands and more. They can be reused and sterilized or disposed of if you prefer.They seem thick enough and good quality enough to sterilize and reuse a number of times...If you have sensitive skin, I can say as someone who has skin problems, I have not had any issues with breakouts etc.Overall my new favorite conical mask!",

                "reviewText": "Edit: I found that if I twist the straps once around a soda can, it stretches them just enough to be comfortable. Don\u2019t even have to leave it around the can long for it to work, probably less than half an hour. They don\u2019t shrink back either. Kind of annoying to have to do but it\u2019s quick and easy enough so at least I can use these instead of having to order more.I was looking for KN95 masks because the ear loops are more convenient than the over-the-head straps on the N95 masks. I saw that the WWDOLL brand was on the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization (EUA) list and is being sold on Amazon directly, not by a third-party seller. They're good quality and I like the black color.The only issue is that the ear loops are way too short. They pull on my ears and make them stick out. After an hour or so of wearing the mask, the backs of my ears start to hurt. I'm a woman and have a fairly petite head. I can only imagine how uncomfortable these would be to wear for a man or someone with a larger head. With longer straps you can twist them or tie knots on the end or put the little rubber adjusters on, but with short straps there's really nothing you can do. Maybe I'll try wrapping them around something for a few days to see if that will stretch them out enough. But really I'll probably just look for another brand. Glad I only got the box of 25.",
