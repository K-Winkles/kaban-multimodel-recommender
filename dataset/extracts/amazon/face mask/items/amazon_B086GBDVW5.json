Otherwise I believe that these are great value for the money, at $.15-$.20 apiece there really is no excuse to not have a clean mask every day. I keep a package in each of the cars. The first time I ordered this product they did come in a resealable package; the next time they were just in clear cellophane. But they work well and they are comfortable to wear and they are easy to breathe through and they meet all of the mask requirements. Wear a mask people!",

The packaging has differed from order to order but the masks have been satisfactory. (My photo shows the masks I received on 3 separate orders). I have not had issues with bad ear loops. If I try to blow a candle out, I can not. They all seam to be a similar quality to the surgical masks that my work place provides. I\u2019ve paid anywhere from $4.50 to $8.00, as the price varies day to day. They do come from China, but I continue to buy them because the price is so great. They do take awhile to arrive, so I just buy a pack every month or so, so I always have a steady supply.",

The late could be due to something in the logistics they have no control. My understanding is that this product is manufactured and shipped overseas, so it added more uncertainty to the shipping. With such a low price for the product, you really should set your expectation realistically on the shipping speed and quality of the product. I am sympathy to the seller and wonder they eventually had any profit to make from it. Gave how low the price I pay, I will rate the seller and product highest",
