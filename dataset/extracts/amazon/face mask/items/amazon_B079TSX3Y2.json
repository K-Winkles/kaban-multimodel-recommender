                "reviewText": "I am sort of new to sheet masking...having tried about a dozen different brands over the past six months. That said, I have been masking (traditionally applied with a brush or fingers) since I was 13 (am now in mid 40's). I know what my skin likes: goopy soothing masks that deliver hydration and reduce redness and hyperpigmentation. I know what my skin hates: perfumes, alcohol, astringents, anything *minty* and coarse/grainy textures.I bought this mask looking for something to hydrate and help with stubborn hyperpigmentation as a regular use mask...not an occasional heavy-lifter/special duty sort of mask. I will be honest and state that I would NOT have purchased this at full price ($30?). Luckily I found it at TJ MAXX for $8.00/4 (so $2/ea). The lot # was 001. Gave it a go based on the positive reviews posted here on amazon and elsewhere on the internet.Initial thoughts, the mask was somewhat difficult to unfold and did not come with a backing like many other sheet masks I have tried. It did feel substantial. similar in thickness to the more expensive masks I have splurged on. The serum was abundant but wasn't overly drippy (happy about this!). Once applied, the fit was fairly decent on my face. The serum felt cooling and soothing. I did not experience any stinging or irritation or notice heavy perfume or fragrance. Happily, the mask was comfortable to wear and didn't slip and slide on my face during treatment. Although the instructions indicate the effective time of this mask is 5-10 min, I was distracted and didn't end up removing it until 20 min later. Whoops! The mask was mostly dry by this point, possibly indicating the absorption rate was good. Serum remaining on my skin was absorbed within 5 min after removal.After masking, my skin felt tingly and cool. I noticed initial minor changes to the darkened areas on my forehead and cheeks and did see some small improvement (plumping?) of the fine lines age has blessed me with. My pores appeared smaller. My skin felt very smooth.I found this mask to be adequately hydrating for an early fall day (65 degrees / 54% humidity). Not sure how it would hold up in the dead of winter on super dry skin. Will post an update once we get to snow season.I liked this better than the Creme Shop Rose and Jeju Green Tea masks but not as much as the Karuna Brightening mask (all time fave so far). I aspire to sheet mask more often (daily?) and so I can see this fitting into my routine quite well as an every other day sort of brightening mask, provided I can continue to source it at an affordable price.",
