                "reviewText": "I am a teacher, with classroom sizes of up to 75 students. With that many people in a room, there is usually at least one person who is sick with something. I don't have the luxury of dropping lectures, which means I need to make sure I stay healthy.These masks work really well, for me. They fit snug to my face without the air gaps around the edges that some of the other masks have left me with. That said, they do not fit my son as well (he's a lot skinnier than I am). I wear glasses, so these do fog my glasses to a certain extent. I have found that on days where I also need to wear safety goggles and the mask (and my glasses), it helps if I trim a little of the mask around the eye area. That still leaves the mask fitting well, but does cut down of the fogging of the goggles.I have rarely had one of the ear elastic bands snap. When that does happen, it happens right away when I am putting the mask on, not during the course of the day. I generally have days of 6+ hours of wearing the mask with minimal discomfort.I recommend these for larger faced individuals, and those who have to wear a mask for extended periods of time.",

These aren't my favorite masks and now I wish I hadn't bought the 100 pack! Overall I do like the shape, but I definitely would not buy these again. They're also a bit more flimsy than the mask brand I previously purchased but can no longer find.They work in a pinch, but not my favorite by far.",

                "reviewText": "Update: The review below is still valid for the batch that I received. I had not reported my concerns to the company and was not expecting a response, but they reached out to me (via Amazon) based on this review and have attempted to make it right. An extra star for very good customer service.----------I wanted to like these for the style, level of protection, and convenience of the ear loops. However, the seam attaching the bottom third of the mask pulls apart with the slightest effort. Even if you manage to get it on your face without pulling apart, just moving your jaw while talking or definitely yawning will begin to pull the seam apart. (Interestingly, the top seam is very sturdy even with moderate pulling.) It has been true for all of the masks I\u2019ve tested. This of course makes the masks useless.It\u2019s possible that I got a bad batch, but several other reviewers have indicated the same problem, so it\u2019s clear their quality control is very poor.",
