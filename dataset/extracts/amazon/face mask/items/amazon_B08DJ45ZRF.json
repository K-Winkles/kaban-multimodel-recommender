                "reviewText": "I've been wearing these masks at church, the grocery store, the gym, while getting my haircut, and anywhere else I need a mask for at least several months. Best mask I have found for regular use during the coronavirus pandemic. These masks are thick, but breathable. Ear loops are sturdy - have never had one break on me. The nose clip allows for a very good fit around my nose - if I get to talking too much with the mask on, it sometimes still slips down, but that is somewhat unavoidable with any mask. I'm not a medical professional, although my wife is an ICU nurse and even she has remarked how good these masks seem. Short of finding an actual N95 mask, it seems like you can't really ever be completely sure about the quality of a particular mask, but these masks really do seem like they provide a better degree of protection than cloth masks or other cheap disposable masks. I highly recommend these masks - I'll certainly be using them for the rest of the pandemic.",

                "reviewText": "Have been buying these since 2020 and they have been great. Suddenly they have the brand stamped on the front of the mask and are far too loose to be effective. Really missing the original version. There's likely another quarter to half inch of stretch in the loops now that makes it fit poorly. A bummer as these were my go to surgical masks.",
