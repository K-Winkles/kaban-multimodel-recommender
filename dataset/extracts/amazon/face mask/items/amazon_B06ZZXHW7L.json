If it is below zero, I pull it up over my mouth and nose. It does a great job keeping my neck warm. this 'clava is a bit smaller than the one that I bought several years ago, but I make it work. the main thing that has to move while I am wearing it is the mouth cover (\"adjustable\" part). IF my lips &/or nose start to feel frosty, I can easily pull the 'clava up over my mouth and nose. Later, I can easily pull it or flip it back down. I also wear it under a hooded coat or under/over a winter hat when I'm walking and snowshoeing. It is a great layering piece! I hand or machine wash/dry it after every use, and it is holding up well.I have also worn a balaclava while doing yard work to protect my neck and ears from poison ivy and garlic mustard.",

If you have mid length hair, it works great to keep the hair out of your eyes and ears if you slick your hair back. Price wasn't too expensive either. It's a little looser than I would like but it's not really that much of an issue. Just requires a little adjustment on the face after I put my helmet on. Would definitely recommend to any other bikers out there as well.",
