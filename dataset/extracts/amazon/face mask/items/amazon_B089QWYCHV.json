                "reviewText": "These fit my 6' tall husband well. They were too big for me (Powecom KN95 work for me). We feel better protected with the good fit at nose bridge, sides of face and under the chin. These masks being on the FDA emergency authorization list gives us confidence. I had some N95s from a relative. I think the N95 are the correct size for me but the design leaves gaps where I can feel air moving in and out on the sides and top of the mask, and it's hard to put on and off with the head and neck straps as opposed to the ear loops like these KN95 have. These KN95 fit us much better, are more comfy and easier to use. One weird note: if my husband doesn't shave, his stubble catches the fibers on the inside of these KN95 masks and causes annoying tickly fuzzy stuff. So he makes sure to shave if he's going to need to wear a mask.",

                "reviewText": "Previously I had bought five KN95 masks from the same company/seller that I used for several months in a rotation (I'm a teacher - I'd wear one for a day when around students, then put it aside in a container and use a different one the next day, etc. so it would be about a week between wearings). The ear loops on those were generous, and I ended up having to tie knots in them to shorten them, even when using with an ear saver (headband with buttons to put the loops around). This box of 20 came with four packages of five masks inside, and I've only used one set of 5 so far, but I have not needed my ear saver because the loops are much snugger - it makes for a good snug fit on my face, but the other day my ears were a little sore when I took it off (I also wear glasses, which might affect the ear soreness a bit as well).Other than that, so far I'm satisfied with them.",
