                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic deal! I purchased it primarily due to the impressive ingredient list and my desire for a face mask to enhance my skin. Initially, I was a bit apprehensive after reading a review mentioning skin irritation, but I decided to give it a try, and I'm delighted to report that I experienced no such issues.The packaging includes a convenient small brush that neatly fits into the box. The product itself is thick, and the jar is generously filled. Contrary to some feedback, I found it easy to apply. To ensure a smooth application, I moisten my face first and wet the brush. After 15-20 minutes, I simply rinse with either a rag or paper towel.The results are good \u2013 my skin feels not only clean but also remarkably soft to the touch, with a noticeable improvement in brightness. While I haven't witnessed the dramatic results depicted in promotional videos just yet, I believe such outcomes may manifest after consistent use over a month. Despite this, I'm genuinely pleased with the product and confidently recommend it, earning it a solid 4-star rating from me.",

                "reviewText": "I have very, very sensitive skin and I recently decided to try a turmeric and vitamin c clay mask to address dryness and to diminish the appearance of pock marks on my face... hoping that the mask would not cause breakouts to my sensitive skin. In purchasing this mask, I think that I've found the solution.As the majority of cleansers and soaps on the market cause my skin to breakout, I've been using triple milled soaps for years (lavender or peppermint) to cleanse my face as they don't cause me to breakout but they aren't very moisturizing... leaving my face clean but also dry. Applying moisturizers to my face to address the dryness is a no-no as they cause instant breakouts, so again my face is clean but dry.In my search for a mask that would address the dryness as well as diminish the appearance of the pock marks (while not causing breakouts to my sensitive skin), I decided to try the SHVYOG Turmeric Vitamin C Clay Mask. All I can say is WOW!:* The mask goes on smooth and does not harden and dry up.* When rinsing, this product becomes rich and silky. I was already impressed that the mask applies very smooth but I wasn't expecting the added bonus of the silky texture while rinsing... you're going to love it!* The scent is subtly citrusy... not overpowering at all.* The directions suggest using this mask 1-3 times a week... I've been using it every other night for the past two weeks. I'll make adjustments if need be.* I've noticed a glow to my skin but I believe that it too early to expect to see any change in the appearance of dark spots/pock marks but I am hopeful. I'll update at a later time... keeping my fingers crossed.This mask has been a game changer for me... I can actually say that I have a skin care routine!",
