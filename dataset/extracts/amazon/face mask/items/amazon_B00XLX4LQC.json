                "reviewText": "This is my 3rd RZ mask product and is almost as comfortable as the M2.5 , in size XL , but the fit is just as good . My first RZ product is a first generation neoprene (M1 ) , in size large , fits a little too snugly and needed the extension Velcro strip (included with all but M2.5 masks as they don't use Velcro ) to allow it to be all day comfortable. The mesh ones are a LOT cooler in the summer humidity of Virginia outdoors than neoprene but even their neoprene allows fresh air to touch your face where the inner filter isn't touching. This is where a good fit can be a good or bad thing. Good fit of the filter elements keeps more stuff out but that also includes a cool breeze and inhaled air when being very active . Things like running, biking, heavy lifting, etc cause me a slight discomfort as if I'm wearing an oxygen deprivation mask but the F3 or F2 filter elements really help. Is it as free breathing as no mask at all ? No but there's also never a sensation of a need to gasp for air after taking the mask off. The cheaper masks I've used that didn't fit well allowed more fresh air but because it was bypassing the filter to get in . The RZ F2 or F3 truly do reduce the resistance a great deal as I found out back in January when I was diagnosed with asthma but it turned out I had imminent heart failure and I was using the neoprene one at work to warm the air I was inhaling. The F1 (comes with all their masks ) left me gasping for air at times when moving very heavy objects at a fast pace at work but the F3 and F2 I bought reduced it a lot.After conquering the widow maker I'm ok with the F1 filters that came with my M2 and M2.5 but still enjoy the F3s I bought the most.The M2 doesn't feel like it's pulling down , like the neoprene one does after a while , and I believe it's because I got the right size. My measurements were right between L and XL so I erred on the side of XL this time vs L with the neoprene one .Filters from others won't fit right but of a great for isn't important they'll suffice in a pinch. I've tried the filters from other masks and they aren't as large plus the vent hole isn't exactly right on either side.The reason I prefer this brand over any others is the F2 and F3 filters. Other than that Base Camp brand mesh fits just as well as this one and is just as comfortable at a little better price but the RZ M2.5 with F3 filter wins hands down for my needs in a dusty, fast paced work environment.",

The single velcro strap fits well and is secure even when you have to move around looking at different angles while your sanding larger projects. RZ has been my preferred brand of filtration masks for a long time and the M2 Mask will most certainly not disappoint.",

I was impressed with the quality of the materials and what is included at the price.In the box: a mask, replacement filter, cloth storage bag (with a small carabiner on it!), valve tool (also attached to the bag), and instructions.The fit is a little uncomfortable. The strap is a hook and loop and when it is fit snug, I find it putting pressure on the back of my neck toward the base of my skull. This also pushes the bridge of my nose inwards. I might have to fiddle around with the fit a little.I don\u2019t find that it gets in the way of any protective eyewear, and had minimal fogging!Bottom line, it\u2019s a good value for the price.",

This model has carbon filters and worked as advertised.What I didn't like: I haven't used this type of strap, single, wide and below the ears and I don't like it. The mask is constantly pulling straight down, I would buy the 2-strap. Also the top of the filter digs into my nose and pinches too, so it's hard to breathe with my nose.It is lightweight so my cheeks could get more air than my nose.The moisture/exhaust ports have 3 very finicky pieces each (x2), the filter inside is only attached by the ports so the sides of it flap around.The ports fill with liquid if you exhale.It comes with a bag, a tool to remove the filters and a velcro strip if your head is bigger than a child's.",
