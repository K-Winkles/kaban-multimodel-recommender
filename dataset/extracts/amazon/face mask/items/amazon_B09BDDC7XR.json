I cannot be the only one that wears several at-a-time, to get through them faster. 97 is a much better number (and coincidentally not a prime number). Getting less also reduces pollution and trash which is important for the environment. My mom tells me 97% is still an \"A\" and gets me into Harvard. Looking forward to a future purchase where there are even fewer items so that I get to order again sooner! Last but not least, the pleasant surprise and anticipation of knowing that one need not count all the way to one hundred gives the tingles and is just beyond expression!! [ps. never fear, 3 is a prime number]",

                "reviewText": "Mask quality is good. Shipping was sloppy and careless. Product bag was open and half of the masks were loose inside the Amazon packaging. At least 11 masks had broken straps upon arrival and are unusable. With usage over the last couple weeks, I can confirm several more have had straps break when my child was putting the mask on. You do not get the deal you think you're getting when so many masks are not usable at all.",
