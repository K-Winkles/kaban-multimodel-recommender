Cleanse skin thoroughly before applying the mask. Apply a thin layer to face avoiding eyes and lips. Leave mask on for 10 minutes until it dries. Use warm water to gently remove and pat dry with a clean cloth. Recommended to follow with a moisturizer Does this work for all skin types? Dead Sea Mud is considered safe for all skin types. However, it is important to do a patch test on a small part of the skin area prior to first use. Wait several minutes to observe. Discontinue if irritation occurs or if you suspect a reaction. Does it sting? A slight burning sensation is normal while the mask is drying out on the skin as this means that the mask is working on cleaning the skin. However, if it becomes too much, wash it off for instant relief. How does Dead Sea Mud work on the skin? As the Dead Sea Mud dries on the skin, it absorbs dead skin cells, impurities and excess oils which helps unclog pores and cleanse the skin. The dirt and impurities are washed away together with the mask, leaving the skin feeling fresher and cleaner.",

After applying the mask, I did not apply any facial cream. It was smooth and very good. Observe it for a few days to see if you are allergic. The first experience was good.",

I have bought more expensive products that irritate my skin. Although the product says it is for oily and acne prone skin, I do not have that problem. I think that is why it felt like it dried out my skin a little. I recently started using an oil or moisturizer immediately after I remove it. While it does leave my skin feeling softer, I still don\u2019t know if its doing much of anything else (that is why I gave it fours stars). But I will be buying another one of their masks for my mom since she struggles with products for her sensitive skin too.",

                "reviewText": "I recently tried this Dead Sea mud mask, and I have to say, I'm really impressed. The first thing I noticed was how silky and smooth the texture of the mask was. It was easy to apply, and it went on smoothly without any clumps or bumps.After letting the mask sit for a few minutes, I could feel it working its magic. It started to tighten and dry on my skin, and I could feel a slight tingling sensation. While it was drying, I could see the impurities being drawn out of my skin, and my pores looked visibly smaller after I washed the mask off. My skin felt refreshed and revitalized after using it, and I was left with a smooth, glowing complexion.Another thing I appreciated about this mud mask was that it didn't leave my skin feeling dry or tight, like some other masks can. Instead, it left my skin feeling soft and hydrated, which is a rare treat for me. I've used this mask several times now, and I've noticed that it helps to reduce the appearance of blemishes and fine lines as well.Overall, I'm really happy with this Dead Sea mud mask, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an effective, yet gentle skincare treatment. It's a great way to pamper your skin and give it the nourishment it needs to look its best.",

The product itself appears to be heavy however it is not, it drys and is quite light weight. I believe the heavy appearance is due to the natural moisturizers. It does not dry out your skin...a previous review is misleading. I have very sensitive skin and I have no problems whatsoever. I look forward to using this throughout 2024.",
