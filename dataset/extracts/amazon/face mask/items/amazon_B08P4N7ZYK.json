With hearts filled with wanderlust, we packed our life into two suitcases, and moved to Central America. We fell in love with the simplicity of life in a place that rises and sets with the sun - a place where tides, not traffic, determine the course of your day. And, Sam found surfing...an instant passion that led him to the water every day. Life was good, but our skin started to suffer the consequences of hours in the equatorial sun. Driven by a passion for simplicity, clean ingredients, and a desire to create naturally-based, effective skincare that could serve our fellow community of adventurers, explorers, and dreamers, Mad Hippie was born. Mad Hippie has given us the opportunity to work with some amazing people, and create the kind of company that we dreamed of - one that is forward thinking with regard to sustainability, one that listens to its customers, and one that gives back.",

I was introduced to the line a year ago exactly now, and every time they release a new product I look forward to using them and the Microdermabrasion Facial scrub was no different. I absolutely love how gentle the scrub is on your face, but it is powerful. It leaves my face feeling clean and stripped of any dirt or excess oil and so smooth and soft, and the after you use it the GLOW on your face is so incredible. It does not make your skin dry or feeling rough. The bonus is that the ingredients are super clean, smells amazing and cruelty free! I would highly recommend it (and do so to all my friends already :))!",
