                "reviewText": "I've been using these masks for about a year, and I LOVE them. They're so cheap, but they work well. If you've never tried sheet masks before or are trying to find a cheap option so you can do them more often, these are a great option. They DO contain fragrance, but it's pretty much last on the ingredients list, and they've never irritated my skin and my skin is pretty sensitive and I have mild rosacea. I find the scent to be pleasant; each one has a slightly different scent. They are also very well hydrated but don't drip everywhere and are SO easy to unfold. I've noticed there is always a bit of extra essence to squeeze out of the bag afterwards. I personally love that--after the initial essence has soaked in, I just pat in the excess essence!I've noticed when I use these sheet masks regularly (at least once a week--ideally more often), my pores on my T-zone and cheeks are smaller. So I think them looking big might be a sign my skin is dehydrated (dehydrated skin is both dry and overproduces oil.) These masks also make my skin glow and look less red. My skin gets SO red like a tomato if I exercise or go out in the heat, and these sheet masks (or any tbh lol) calm down my skin immediately instead of it taking forever to calm down. For the past month, I've been using one sheet mask a night and alternating between these, the $2 Missha ones, and some cheap Etude House ones, and my skin has never looked better! :) I do them in the evening and my skin still looks good when I wake up!",

                "reviewText": "After washing and toning my face, I love the cool, soothing feeling of this mask. After just 15-20 minutes, it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and supple. It makes my skin glow. I love how the notches in the mask allow me to size it for my face. Even after using the mask on my face, there is still so much left in the package, I can fold the mask back up and put it back in the package for 1 more use. There's so many different varieties of masks that I can determine which one I need for various times. I.E. in the morning, I'll use one of the brightening masks, before bed, I'll use the moisturizing or regeneration masks. Great value for money and high quality.",

                "reviewText": "These are great! Buying Korean skincare online can be risky due to fakes etc but I\u2019d purchased this brand before and had some faith. Seller has very good reviews so I took the plunge on this larger pack and was pleasantly surprised. All 39 arrived well packaged and in great condition (I just grabbed a handful to show for the photo!). You get a really nice range of different masks. They all have an expiration date clearly printed on the bottom and this batch came with a great expiration of 2022. The packaging design isn\u2019t as pretty as some brands but don\u2019t let that fool you into thinking these aren\u2019t good!Each mask has its own qualities based on the ingredients and these are listed on the front. My favourite for my oily, acne prone skin is the seaweed mask, but there are none that I actually dislike. None of these masks irritate my acne and they have a pleasant but mild scent. The masks are big so will fit a range of faces, you just need to do a little adjustment to get it to fit a smaller face. I have to re-fold it around my chin a few times but that\u2019s fine. I find that the upper lip area dries out fastest for me, perhaps because it\u2019s a thin strip, but when I readjust the chin area I then pat the upper lip to deposit any spare serum there. The key is to not let the mask dry out on your face.These masks are thick and not easily torn if you\u2019re new to unfolding them. They are also soaked in serum which is really good. After you\u2019re done I recommend squeezing the serum out. I pat a little extra into my face and the rest into my neck, collar and chest area. The serum in these masks isn\u2019t really designed to be stored long term out of the packet so I don\u2019t suggest wringing it out and keeping it in a bottle etc. It may expire quickly even if stored in the fridge.I use these once a week in the evening, in place of my usual serum, so the mask gets applied after toner and essence, followed by moisturiser. I like to gently pat my face periodically to ensure it\u2019s being absorbed and remove the mask after 20 minutes while it\u2019s still wet. Then I wring it out etc.These are a really cost effective way of introducing sheet masks into your routine. It\u2019s a great weekly treat to look forward to and I enjoy seeing which one I pull out of the pile each week. Further, they make great little extras in gifts - I picked a few cute fruity ones out of the pile as stocking stuffers this Christmas.Overall I think these masks are great for both beginners and more experienced skincare enthusiasts alike. Don\u2019t let the low price or less flowery cutesy packaging fool you - these are really good!",
