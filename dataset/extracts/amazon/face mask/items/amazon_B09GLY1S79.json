                "reviewText": "I'm long winded, so I'll give you the punchline first:For the price, these masks:1] are much better than I expected2] have some amount of variation in strap length that doesn't matter for my shape/size of face but could matter for small faces3] have all the \"right\" markings, although to me that's no guarantee of a mask not being counterfeit4] are lightweight and comfortable for my face5] don't seal wonderfully around the bridge of my nose when exhaling; fogs up glasses/sunglasses. Seems to seal fine when inhaling. In other words, low risk of outside air sneaking in unfiltered, highly likely unfiltered exhaled air from you would get out. Don't wear these around your high risk grandma if you are trying to protect her from you.6] definitely have 5 distinct layers (see picture).Long-winded verson:As with any commercial product nowadays, it's hard to know what to expect after reading reviews. The most vocal and emotional reviewers are generally those that get a crappy product and are understandably upset. When I'm shopping for the best value version of any cheap, mass produced item, I fully expect there to be some percentage of products that made it out the door with defects.That said, the box of Funight masks that I just received are much better than I expected. I haven't opened every single mask up, so there may be some in this box that have some of the issues mentioned in other reviews (ear straps that easily detach for instance), but so far so good. At this price, I'll be happy if 3/4 of these don't have defects.I don't claim to be a filtration expert, but I know enough about filtration media to know that the type of material matters much more than the amount. In this case, for anyone basing their choice on these masks having 5 layers as advertised, they do; I attached a picture of a section cut out showing all 5 layers seperated. I wouldn't have been too surprised if they didn't at this price, but hey, I'll take it!Also, all of the \"correct\" markings (\"KN95\" and \"GB 2626-2019\") are thermally compressed into the mask, not that I personally think that means anything. I can't imagine there is some reason that counterfeiters can't put the right markings on their masks; relying on that as an indicator of masks being legitimate makes about as much sense as looking for markings that say \"counterfeit\" on counterfeit masks.These Funight masks are really comfortable for me, and do a great job of sealing around my face, except up over my nose, where they do allow some air to flow out and fog up any glasses/sunglasses I might be wearing. They're no worse than the accordian/surgeon style masks I've worn previously though.They are comfortable over my nose, but all masks I've tried that don't have an extra strip of rubber/foam to help seal don't do a very good job for me, even some very uncomfortably tight N95 masks don't get this part right. For reference, I'd guess I have a medium size face/head for a man.I have recently tried some 3M 9205+ masks that seal amazingly well over my nose while still being comfortable in that area. There are other drawbacks though; mainly price (about 4x the price of these Funights) but also they aren't nearly as comfortable to me as these KN95 style masks with earloops instead of full head straps. I use the 3M N95 masks if I feel the situation is more critical; i.e. I'm in a high risk area (crowded with lots of random people) or if I'm getting on an airplane.I bought these Funight masks to use in more \"everyday\" situations that I don't expect to be particularly high risk, but I'd like to be wearing something more effective than a cloth mask or a single or double layer accordion style mask.The only quality control issue I've seen thus far is, as lots of other reviews have mentioned, the ear loop lengths vary noticeably from one mask to another. Thus far all of the lengths have been fine for me; none have been too tight; some have been a little loose but putting one twist in the ear loop has been enough to get it just right. The straps seem to have a lot of stretch, so the batch I have would probably be fine for someone with a larger head than me, but might be too loose for someone with a really small face/head.",

                "reviewText": "The cup shape of the KN95 face mask is roomy and stiff enough so when I breath, the fabric does not suction into my nose. The elastic bands are well secured to the mask so they won't rip off when using it throughout the day. The straps are soft and stretchy enough but still somewhat irritating when wrapped around my ears. But this is due to wearing behind-the-ears hearing aids plus eyeglasses so my ears are kind of crowded. I'm sure this mask will be comfortable for others without this problem. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the quality of this PPE.",

These are my favorite masks for work, they\u2019re comfortable, have a metal nose insert to get a tight(er) seal but they don\u2019t leave a mark on my face. My oooonly complaint is that I almost wish the straps were a little tighter, I don\u2019t feel I get a complete seal on my cheeks but I also have a smaller head so take that as you will.",

                "reviewText": "As someone trying to stay safe in public spaces, I decided to try the Funight KN95 face masks. After using them for a few weeks, here is my assessment:Pros:- Pack of 50 makes them very affordable per mask- 5-layer material seems effective at filtering particles- Nose clip and adjustable ear loops allow custom fit- Breathable fabric is soft and comfortable on skin- Ideal for everyday use running errands etc.Cons:- Not FDA-approved or medical grade- Some variation in ear loop sizes between masks- Don't fully seal around nose so some air leaks out- Strong smell right out of the box so needs time to air out before usage.For the price, these KN95 masks exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort and protection for everyday use. The 5-layer material and nose clip ensure a decent seal, though they don't prevent all air leakage. I wish the ear loops had more consistency in sizing. Overall, these make a solid choice for public outings when medical masks aren't mandatory. I keep some handy to share with family too. Just don't rely on them for high-risk healthcare situations. Hope this review helped!",
