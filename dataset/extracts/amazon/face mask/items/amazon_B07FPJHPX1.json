                "reviewText": "I'm 59 and have tried so many different products over the years and have very few that I liked. I found one that I used for years, but of course, it was discontinued and since then I've been trying to find another that not only worked, but also didn't cost an arm and a leg!These are fantastic! My favorites are the Tea Tree and the Cactus, but really they all offer something great. The scents are mild but nice and soothing and my sensitive skin has no bad reaction to any of them. My skin feels great after I use them and the results are visible. My pores are smaller, my skin is tighter and more elastic, and it's brighter. I get compliments on my skin now! At 59! I'd highly recommend these masks to anyone who wants improved skin. I make sure to rub the serum down to my neck as well after I take the mask off. These really do make a difference!",

Each of the masks smells the natural ingredient it is made of (i.e. cucumber). But I have a sensitive skin and it usually doesn't react well to fragrances. I tried two masks and they both gave me a burning sensation on the skin; probably the fragrances. Other than that, they seems to be good basic sheet masks.I won't order again. But because they have a good list of usual ingredients, do the job and are cheap, I recommend the product (if your skin can tolerate fragrances).",

The packs comes with so many different scents and purposes (reducing fine lines, increasing glow, minimizing the appearance of pores, general skin health, the list goes on). They feel really great when you put them on and for hours after. They smell really good and it seems fairly natural and not chemically like other masks I've tried. I don't know much about skincare but I really love these face masks. They don't make me break out; they actually really help make my skin look supple, glowy, and healthy.Seriously, treat yourself and buy these!!",

Well....I don't care for these at all. I feel they are way too dry and not nearly enough serum as compared to other ones I have tried. I also feel like the masks are way too small in the eyes and the bridge of the nose area. I found it difficult to try and place it around my eyes without it touching my eyes and eye lashes and making sure it would lay flat on my nose. They could have made the eyes bigger in my opinion so we wouldn't have to worry about getting the serum in our eyes. Again, this is just my experience and yours could be different, but I think there's way better facial sheet masks like Maree, Tonymoly, Avatara, and more.",
