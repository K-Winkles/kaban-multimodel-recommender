                "reviewText": "I do a lot of riding (bicycles, motorcycles) in fairly cold conditions at times and my face gets pretty cold from wind chill. I have an old balaclava, but it\u2019s very basic and thin and while it works fine, I wanted one with a bit more heft and with a more distinct \u201cflap\u201d to make it easier to expose my nose/face when I need to. These definitely do the trick. I\u2019d say these are more of a wind deflector/blocker as they aren\u2019t super warm, but for me that\u2019s what I wanted. One thing to note is the open/eye area is a bit short, so if you don\u2019t have it positioned perfectly the lower face part can ride up into the bottom of your eyes. The best part of these are the separate lower face/nose part makes it much easier to pull down than my 1-piece balaclava. Note these did have a very synthetic smell when the first arrived, but after a handful of washes that has gone away. And of course being a 3-pack is a bonus as I can now go a few rides before I have to do the wash.",

                "reviewText": "Product features:Got these for my daughter as her ski masks, they are easy to put on but fairly thin, so if you ski in extreme cold it might not be sufficient. The skirt is very long, making it easy to be fully covered by whatever you wear on the outside fully covering your head and neck and blocking wind. They used the same material throughout, so there's not an area specifically for breathing. I am not sure about the uv protection claim as it's fairly thin.Quality:Fairly thing fabric but otherwise there's no problem with it, size is great for kids and adult due to the stretching. Keep in mind you get 3 for the price so you shouldn't be expecting the same performance of a single piece that costs twice as much.Price:$9.99 for a pack of 3 cannot be beat.",
