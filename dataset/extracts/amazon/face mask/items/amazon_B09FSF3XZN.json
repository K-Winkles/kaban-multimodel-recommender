                "reviewText": "I really like these honestly. I hadn\u2019t ever bought KN95 masks before so I don\u2019t have much to compare to but they are watertight/pass the water test, they fit nicely, no chemical smell after about a minute after removing from the wrap, not painful on my ears, and I love the colors. They are a little loose on me but I\u2019m small and 4\u201911\u201d and I\u2019ve had other masks be painfully tight so they\u2019re probably perfect for most people lol. I wore one several times and eventually the nose strip came unattached and began floating in the mask but didn\u2019t poke me and honestly you\u2019re probably not supposed to wear them for a week. Straps are perfect and none have broken yet.My only complaint is the masks are JAM packed into the box, and some of them are folded/bent on the far edges from being compressed so tightly. They need a bigger box or some quality control so none of the masks get folded. It\u2019s maybe like 1 in 5 masks like this. I haven\u2019t tried to wear one of those yet so we\u2019ll see, I\u2019ll update if they\u2019re unwearable because 20% of the box is way too high if they can\u2019t be used.I like to wear very colorful cloth masks but KN95s are just so much more effective that I switched, and I\u2019m excited not to have to wear white, blue, or black.Overall as long as I can use most of the box I\u2019ll reorder.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Quality and Colorful KN95 Masks That Work",
                "reviewText": "I just bought my second box (of 50) of these attractive KN95 masks, so you can tell I'm highly satisfied with them. Here's why: first, they do the job effectively. We use some scented candles occasionally at home. When I returned one day I couldn't make out the scent at all, then, when I took off the mask the aroma was obvious. So I think they do the job well. Second, they are attractive, they come in a number of different patterns and colors. I'd best describe them as kind of a tye-dyed look, some in lighter colors (oranges and reds that my wife prefers to wear, I tend towards the light and darker blues.) We've both had compliments on them. (Sad in this day and age that we are complimenting each other on our masks!) Finally, the fit is very comfortable for us both and we have different sized faces. Frequently we wear them to ride the elevator and exit our building and then forget to take them off when we get outdoors. I think that speaks well for their comfort. Unlike the cloth masks I used to wear, these are made to fully cover nose and moth and wrap under my chin for a good fit. Now for a couple of tips: each mask is wrapped in an individual plastic envelope. I recommend you remove the mask maybe an hour or so before you are going to wear it. There is a slight chemical odor when you first put them on if you do so fresh out of the protective plastic. It's not terrible and it dissipates fairly quickly, but if you air them out for a short while ahead of time, you won't experience this at all. (The plastic wrap is also great to have because I like to carry at least one spare in my pocket in case I need it while I'm out.) Finally, although these are made for one use and are disposable, I have found that if I only wear them in and out of my building and maybe for a short time in the store (I only wear them indoors) I can use them several times and then throw them away. So a box of 50 will last more than two months easily for one person. I feel a lot safer wearing these as opposed to the cloth variety. Also, I do plan to travel some day (hopefully soon) and many airlines, such as Lufthansa, require only N95 or KN95's so having these is a must.",

Soft2. Breatheable3. Fun and colorful4. No one, even at the hospitals will ask you to use their masks. They see that it is KN95 and will let you wear your own.5. Ear loops are super comfortable that I forget that I even have a mask on!6. Lots of compliments.7. They are all individually wrapped, which is a BONUS!Believe all the positive or 5 star review written for this masks. I am a repeat customer for these particular masks!Oh, and the price point is truly awesome that I don't mind giving it away to strangers that compliment it!Hope this review helps!",

The outside fabric of the mask seems high quality fashion and the inside material seems focused on more for filtration. The elastic for the ear loops is comfortable. The masks are individually wrapped so great for throwing a few in your bag/purse. The mask does have a slight odor when you first unwrap it but it dissipates fairly quickly. I have purchased this product several times as my husband has an auto immune disorder that requires us to always wear masks while in public.",

They're a bit small for my husband (pictured), and his strap broke. Love the colors! This is the least heavy, most comfortable N95 face mask I've ever tried.",

                "reviewText": "These were rather hard-edged against my skin and while I read similar comments before making the purchase, I wanted to give them a try anyway since most of the comments have been a positive experience plus the graphics on them are beautiful. Similar to other comments, the fitting was tighter than most masks I've used and the straps have broken off several times when just putting them on and a few times when wearing them indoors when they were required to be worn. The loops need just a bit more flexible length otherwise they pull my ears forward to the point where I have to keep adjusting them so they'll stay on my head. Friends and family who I've given one of these masks had a similar experience.I'm hoping that the makers of this product view this as constructive criticism from a customer who works in health care and is used to wearing PPE. They are on the right path toward a great product that needs just a few edits in design to make this more of a universal fit.",
