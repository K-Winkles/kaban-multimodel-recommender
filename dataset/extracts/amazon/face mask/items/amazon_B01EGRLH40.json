I've only used TonyMoly and The FaceShop brands three times and am not familiar with this brand. I bought 3 different packs for gifts and ended up with an extra pack. I was hesitant to use it because I have very sensitive skin. I first tried the hyaluronic pack. The sheet mask fits my face better than TonyMoly's. The amount of serum, size and moisturizing effect is very comparable to The FaceShop brand. Way better than TonyMoly. I have used the remaining packs daily (8 days total so far) in preparation for the Christmas holidays with family and have had great results. This is my first time doing sheet masks daily. The price point makes it very affordable to add to my nightly routine. My husband and my family noticed the difference in skin tone and complexion. I've heard from two ladies who I gifted these with and they said it feels luxurious. I will definitely buy again and would highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I write this as I wear the Charcoal face mask. Full disclosure: this is the first one that I have used. However, I was so impressed by the quality that I had to write a review. The serum in here is so, so good. I've used a wide variety of Tony Moly and Sephora face masks. Both brands have a sheet mask sitting in a very watery serum. You almost feel like the good stuff is just dripping off of you. This product has a slightly thicker consistency, so you can actually scoop out a little and rub it in with your finger. It makes it feel like you're getting a great amount of moisture and that the product is sinking into your skin. The price is amazing for 12 face masks. I had bought a few packs of the Tony Moly set, which used to be much cheaper, but switched to this brand upon seeing the price jump. I am so glad that I did. The actual sheet mask is good quality and not so thin that you can barely touch it without a rip. As usual, it won't fit every face perfectly, but it is easy enough to smear a little extra product on the exposed bits (for me, around my under eye area and the tip of my nose). I 100% recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Such a killer deal!! You get a ton of masks for such a cheap price. The masks themselves are made of a soft, thick cotton material. The pouches have plenty of serum, but not dripping wet which is great. The cucumber one smells just like the pear glace' lotion from Victoria Secret. Soooo heavenly! The avacodo, honey smell pretty similar slightly fruity and fresh. I leave them on about 15-20 minutes. When I take them off my skin looks amazing! Soft, hydrated and vibrant. I really haven't noticed a difference in the different masks, they seem to have the same great feeling and results no matter which one I use. I haven't tried the charcoal one yet, but the others seem similar but with a little different scent to them. I gave them 4 stars because the masks fit funny, not a perfect fit for my face. And there's a weird crease in in each one of them across the cheek area. The results and price make up for that though, so I will be repurchasing these because my skin looks fantastic when I use them! Great, affordable facial sheet masks.",

                "reviewText": "There was very little to no serum left in the package, which makes sense given how cheap these are. The only issue is that they dry out quickly. The drying out would not be an issue if there was extra serum, but it is very annoying when the edges of the sheet mask stop sticking to your face because it is dry and there is nothing to rehydrate the mask with.The meterial is soft but thick and dries out quickly as previously mentioned. I prefer sheet masks that are thinner but I did enjoy how soft these are.The sheet masks also did not fit my face well, which will obviously happen with some masks since it is very hard to make something that will fit everyone's face. These were smaller than other masks I've tried with oddly placed holes for eyes. The mouth hole was also quite small but placed well for my face.I did like how moisturized my face felt after using them, though I've noticed better results from pricery masks.Overall these masks are fine, especially for the price or if you're just getting into sheet masks. I will probably not buy them again as they did not fit me well, but other than that they were, again, fine.",
