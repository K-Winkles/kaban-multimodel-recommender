                "reviewText": "This is a very reasonably priced pack of sheet masks. There are six different types, with three of each. Several are moisturizers with extra properties such as nourishing or soothing. The others are more specific to pore cleansing or say firming. There is something for everyone in the variety. You apply for 10-20 minutes on clean skin (be sure to use toner first per the instructions), peel off, and then rub in the excess serum. There will likely be a little serum left in the pouch, too.The masks feel wonderful, especially on tired skin. For example, I was exhausted one night and fell asleep without my usual nighttime skincare routine. My facial skin was tight and dry the next day. A moisturizing sheet mask brought some relief. The serums are kind of sticky though. I applied my usual day cream on top once the serum was fully dry and absorbed, but in terms of makeup the most I can apply is a light dusting of powder. Foundation or anything rubbed on the skin kind of pills up due to the sticky serum. This would be a product to use at night or if you are not planning to wear other makeup.The scents are very mild to the point that they are barely there. The honey mask only had the faintest smell of honey. These are unlikely to bother people who are sensitive to scented products. The masks have a plastic mesh piece you can pull off to help unfold the mask. I used to like this when I first started using sheet masks, but now I find it's unnecessary excessive packaging and just prevents the part you apply to your face from absorbing more serum. A lot of the serum sticks to the mesh. It does not affect my rating, just something to bear in mind if you are not a fan of the extra piece to peel off.One mask was stuck inside the pouch, almost glued inside. I had to pull very hard to get it out and nearly tore the mask. That appears to have been a fluke.These are less than $1 per mask, a great price. This would be fun for a girls' sleepover or night out, party favors for goody bags, or stocking stuffers.",

                "reviewText": "If you can endure the slight challenge of unfolding these masks and getting them properly placed on your face you will be rewarded with a soothing and effective skin enhancement. Pro tip: use a mirror when putting it on your face. The mask itself was just shy of dripping with moisture and I found I had to drag some of it down and rub it on my neck so it didn't drip off my chin and onto my clothes. I worried that it might leak into my eyes, but it didn't. I also worried about my chronically chapped upper lip and thought that perhaps the contents of the mask would aggravate it, but it didn't. I first used the Green Tea mask and left it on for 20 minutes. After removing the film, my face was still wet from the mask material and I patted my face with my hands until it was dry. My skin had a healthy shine and was soft and supple. As i'd done the mask before bedtime, I waited until morning to wash my face. There was no feeling that a coating was being washed off so I assume the majority of the mask product was absorbed into my skin.Overall, I was impressed with the results. The immediate effect after using the mask was plumped and refreshed skin. Having so many masks on hand means I can not only pamper myself with regular self-care but also keep a couple in reserve for when I want to look fresh for a special occasion.",

                "reviewText": "When I have a 'get together' for cards/games it's always fun to have a little planned shared activity. So, with 6 different versions in a box, everyone got to pick their own flavor/scent and then we could compare notes (after we got done with the giggles of trying to get them all applied).Speaking of application, everyone agreed these were easier than most to apply and included plenty of product on each mask.Some of the comments from the crowd were: 'soothing', 'refreshing feeling', 'cooling sensation' and 'nice fragrance' (for the rose and Aloe).We played a round of R*mmiKub with our masks on (which was kind of funny). At the end of the game play the masks came off. Did we suddenly look 20 years younger? Hardly, but everyone enjoyed their mask. It was fun to be able to smell/touch all the different versions. Each mask package is helpfully labeled with the intent or goal for the given variety. For instance, Green Tea states it is for Refreshing/Pore Cleaning and Honey was for Nourishing and Moisturizing, etc. That gives you just a little bit more information as you reach in the box to grab another one.I would say this is a pretty decent value for the # of masks in the box.",

I am a lover of KBeauty and enjoy trying new, Eastern, Asian ingredients. I have found these ingredients just as effective as Western - but much, much more affordable.I chose this skin masks pack due due to the variety. Tonight I used the Aloe Vera - which also has natural collagen ingredients in it. BONUS.I also stay clear of dimethicone. I don\u2019t mind it later down the list of ingredients, but it cannot be in the top 10. Since these are from China - I was not sure how they would make the essence/serum to be smooth and silky. I was pleased to see that none have dimethicone as an ingredient. (Yes, that is my soap box!)They are easy to unfold and place on my face. The only thing that would be nice is a listing of the different masks on the box and what they do.I usually do a mask every 2 or 3 days. These will be fun to add to the mix. They are reasonably priced - and the ingredients are effective. I recommend!",
