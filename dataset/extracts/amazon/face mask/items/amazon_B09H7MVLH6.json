                "reviewText": "All I can say is MAKE SURE TO WASH BEFORE USING!I washed mine in the sink beforehand, and was shocked to see how much dye and tiny fabric particulates was left in the water. You DO NOT want that stuff on your face or in your lungs. Not to mention these masks stink like chemicals right out of the box.Other than that, pretty decent masks. Soft, doesn't pull on the ears like some masks do. I would say these are medium-sized. They fit me perfect, but I could see them being slightly too large for petite faces, and too tight for those with strong chins or wide faces.All in all not bad. The dye and particulates are a little concerning, but nothing a wash doesn't solve. Just make sure to hand-wash, or put in a wash bag on delicate cycle. Either will help prolong the life of the masks. Also, made of polyester and spandex, these will not shrink in the dryer.4/5 stars for decent masks at the price.",

                "reviewText": "I might've bought the wrong size, but as a small adult, I figured the adult size would be more suitable than a child's mask. I like the design, but I struggle with keeping the mask close to the bridge of my nose, which means it slips down pretty often. My nose, in case you need reference, is straight and slightly round at the tip, which means masks don't /usually/ slip down. For people with maybe wider and/or flatter noses (no judgment, but just in case your features are different than mine), these masks probably are not super suitable. If there was a metal pieces to hug the bridge of wearer's nose, maybe. There's no way to adjust this either because it's entirely cloth. It is nicely breathable and soft.",
