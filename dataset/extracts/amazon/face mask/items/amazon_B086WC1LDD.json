I purchased these as back ups in case we are out and about and forget our nicer ones. After my daughter came home from the first day of school wearing a disposable paper mask issued by the school and not the fancy screen printed one we bought her from Target to match her back to school outfit because she lost it at recess, I knew we were going to need some backups. When these masks came in they had a slightly weird smell and they seemed to fit everyone slightly loose, but after I machine washed and dried them they did shrink a little and the smell is completely gone. Now they fit me, my 13 yr old, and 9 yr old nicely. However, my husband has not tried them on after they\u2019ve been washed yet, and I\u2019m worried they might be a little bit snug on him now. The material is very soft, like T-shirt material, the stitching is very soft - not scratchy or anything like that. I had my kids each put a couple of these in their backpack in case they lose their mask at school and I\u2019m keeping a few of them in my car. Overall, worth the money!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these a couple weeks ago when masks were still fairly hard to find. At the time the price was well under $30 and I was willing to take the risk, especially since they would arrive much more quickly than many other websites. I am happy with these. They are well made: no loose threads and no fabric issues or inconsistencies that I noticed. I tried them on before washing and they were slightly loose on me, but after washing them they tightened slightly and provide a pretty snug fit. They are very comfy, although they appear to be two layer jersey fabric (some reviews say 3?). Do I think these provide filtration? No. Do they satisfy the guideline for facecovering when needed? yes. I wore one yesterday and was able to breathe very well while shopping. I plan to do some basic modification so these will fit my kids if we need them to. The only complaint someone might have is that there is no discernible front and back. It doesn\u2019t bother me since we now have 50...I\u2019ll just move on to another mask if I have to remove it. Very satisfied.",

I\u2019d say yes. It\u2019s not rough on your face or ears\u2022 Softness? Soft. Think of jersey cotton sheets or jersey cotton t-shirts for comparison\u2022 They stretch, on the face covering part and on the ear loops\u2022 Good price for quality and quantity (50 pack)\u2022 Washable and reusable\u2022 Good for adults and kids. They fit adults and they fit my almost 12YO. I feel like these would also be friendly for younger kids tooCONS/\u2022 THEY SHRINK!!! When I first received them, I immediately threw them in the washer\u2014 a little detergent, mostly bleach, and ran the cycle with hot water... after that I threw them in the dryer. When I took them out, they were all scrunched up and small... they reminded me of toddler socks. Took a minute but after I dried them I stretched them all back out, one by one. That was kind of a pain. But for the most part, they get back to their normal size (I think?)\u2022 UPDATE??? I\u2019ve gone through all 50 already, and they\u2019ve gotten their second wash and dry... They shrunk again. Back to stretching them all out.\u2022 It\u2019s all white front and back... so FYI, aside from the sewing, you almost can\u2019t tell which is the front or back. If you\u2019re out and about and have it on, then take it off and put it back on... You may or may not forget which side you had facing out (which is important to know). I marked each and every one of them with a small \u201cX\u201d on the inside corner so that I would always know and remember which side is which.RECOMMEND/I give it 4/5 stars. If it wasn\u2019t for the continuous shrinking and the hassle of stretching them all out after drying, I would\u2019ve given it 5. However, if you personally don\u2019t think it would be such an issue, I would definitely recommend these.",

                "reviewText": "I have been making my own masks, but the kiddos seem to misplace them every day! With the prospect of mandatory masks in school this year I decided to look for a bulk alternative so the kids would always have a clean mask for the school day. These did not disappoint - they are super soft and comfortable! They are a bit big for the kiddos so I've purchased some colorful cord locks to shorten the ear loops; but they fit adults very well without any adjustments. They aren't fitted, so these might not be great for people who need to wear a mask for extended periods of time... but for an inexpensive bulk buy they are great! Just a note from reading other reviews - - the package I received were made in Bangladesh and they were great. Other reviewers' masks appear to be made in China and Vietnam and those did not receive the best reviews. I've ordered a second package for my parents, so we shall see where those were made and if there is any difference in quality.",

This one does not have the metal nose piece (description states that it is included) and it is 3 ply though slightly thinner material than the ones we got from Hanes. It is soft and for the price I'll make it work.This fits my husband well as is, leaves gaps on the sides of my face, and is way too big for my 4 year old (granted it is an adult size, so that is expected). I added one pleat to each side and it then does not gap on my face and fits well. My 4 year old needed three pleats on each side (only added one per side to the original Hanes masks) and I folded the ear loops over on each side to make it fit her. With the adjustments, the 4 year old wears this and the original Hanes masks like a champ. The picture from top to bottom shows the 4 year old's mask, mask with one pleat, and mask as is. Next photo is zoomed in to show adjustments made to make this mask fit perfect on a young kid.",

We each have a few in cars/backpacks/purses etc. They wash up nicely (cold water in a laundry bag and low temp in the dryer) and serve the purpose right now so we don't have to use disposables. They are a little on the smaller side so not great for larger faces.",

                "reviewText": "Simple cotton almost stretchy fabric. A bit loose fitting, but that makes them more comfortable to wear in my opinion. Does the job of shielding you from coughing or sneezing on someone else. For the price, I think they are worth it. Easy to store in your pocket, purse, or glovebox. Easy to wash and reuse. I would suggest marking one side of the mask (maybe with a sharpie?) so you remember which side is which when you wear one.",

                "reviewText": "These are handy for the COVID19 world we have to live in, where wearing a face mask is mandated (indoors) everywhere you go. At a dollar a piece, they are handy. Comfortable, I do not overheat in them. Easy to breathe through for those that overheat easily wearing a face mask. Just wish the length was longer so they fit ear to ear. Would not recommend for someone with a larger face shape.PROS: package of 50! Comfortable to wear. Easy to breathe in without overheating. Very stretching fabric. Wash and dry well, no shrinkage. T-shirt type material. Soft fabric.CONS: Must be careful not to over stretch ear loops. Fabric does not go ear to ear, so they would be NO good for someone with a large face shape. Thicker ear loops than other face masks I own. Not adjustable to adjust to fit different people.These would be ideal for children, and adults, teens who are on the more smaller side. Another buyer indicated they sewed on the end of the ear loop to make them fit more snugly. Overall a good deal for the price. Just not for those with larger heads. As these are not good for my teenage son who has a larger head. Hence, the 4 stars instead of 5.",
