These reviews made me pissed where they were complaining about I recommend laying all your masks out individually and let them air out before you use them. No chemical smell. Also I have the most sensitive skin ever I even have acne prone skin and they are so good to my skin. I had them for 4 hrs and they lasted I haven\u2019t used them longer so I couldn\u2019t say they last all day but I have a feeling they do. The material is so nice you can tell they are great quality because it\u2019s thick but not too thick to where you can\u2019t breath. Also I\u2019m petite and they fit nice!I\u2019m a 20 yr old so pls believe my review more than all these old people \ud83d\ude05 also 100 face masks For like $16? Count me in! Also these black masks go well on anyone and any outfit not that it was my main reason I purchased them and friend of mine who\u2019s a nurse recommended these so I purchased them so there you go you won\u2019t be disappointed and if you are you must be those annoying ass customers who is picky on everything grow up.",

The ear loop is soft and comfortable, yet have good elasticity and are not too loose. The black color looks great with any clothing choice. Great value for the money spent. 100 masks last quite a while, even though we use then daily. Getting ready to reorder them, and I would totally recommend these masks for comfort, value, durability, and they look good in the black color. I have actually had several people ask me where I got my black masks, and I always direct them to this product.",
