                "reviewText": "I am 40 yo and few years back started getting dark spots on my face. There are several factors to consider, I had 2 kids and moved to tropical climate couple years back. Some of my dark spots (forehead) showed up during my pregnancy and never went away while other (upper cheek) appeared probably due to increased sun exposure. We have sun year round and coming from a completely different climate, I learned the hard lesson about the sun, sunspots and suncream. While I no longer leave my home without SPF on my face I still have a few dark spots I am battling. Vit E is must in skincare products and Vit C is proven to detoxify and brighten the skin. This clay mask has both of these to me important ingredients as well as turmeric which is precious ingredient that reduces inflammation, detox and brighten. The mask goes on easily, it dries a little when you leave it on the face so it\u2019s best to wash the face after application. Some people like to remove using pads and wipes but this is not the mask to do that. Also, slightly warm water is best way to use when washing off the face product. This mask works great and I really want to try their rose version just because I am crazy about the rose scent. After just one application my skin was brighter, not just the dark spots, I mean overall my entire face was a shade brighter! I can see this product being a part of going out routine on the days/nights you\u2019re trying to look your best. My dark spots are still there but little brighter which I consider amazing results! I can\u2019t wait to use it more and hopefully completely get rid of dark spots! Overall packaging is superb. Even the carton box is well made and has a smooth finish. The best part is it includes the spatula so you don\u2019t have to dig your fingers inside AND it comes with the safety lid underneath the regular lid. Now, that\u2019s how you properly seal beauty product! THANK YOU!",

                "reviewText": "I decided to do a bit of an experiment and use the mask for 20 mins once a day for 2 weeks. I used it every morning after cleansing because I use a retinoid at night. I would not recommend doing this with a new product just because you never know how it will react with your skin. For me, it was a chance I was willing to take.I think the mask is generally harmless. I am currently struggling with adult acne and I am dealing with a lot of redness and hyperpigmentation. The mask will not treat active break outs, I suspect that it could potentially be more irritating if you have active breakouts with sensitive skin. So I would recommended using it once active breakouts have been treated. After using it I do see a glow and my face generally feels very nice. I did not deal with irritation at any point, which was great because it is why I was originally hesitant to try the mask.It was very easy to apply it to my face, it spread like butter with the spatula. I would recommend using it on mostly dry skin. When you wash it off, the water is orange because of the turmeric. It doesn\u2019t stain at all (I am a POC and i have olive skin), but I would still wipe your sink after using it to clean up the residue. Despite it being a clay mask, the mask was not overly tightening. I have used the Aztec clay mask before and that mask can get very tight when it dries, which I found to be more irritating. This one is much more tolerable.Personally I do not see myself repurchasing this product simply because it doesn\u2019t really *wow* me. With the current state of my skin, it doesn\u2019t stand out as a product. I rather invest in a mask that gears more towards hydration than brightening. Perhaps if someone who was dealing with just a few pimples and dark spots and/or has generally clear skin were to use this product then the results might be more notable. Otherwise, it really just is a mask to do if you want to indulge in self-care or want a temporary glow. I think the reviews that insinuate that this mask is miraculous in some way can be a bit misleading. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is extremely unstable so you really don\u2019t get much of its benefits in products like these.Perhaps if I use it longer I could see better results. I am considering continuing the usage of the mask but reducing it to 2-3 times a week. I use topicals with actives and I don\u2019t want to do too much on my skin. I plan on finishing the product.Bottom line: This is a good mask in that the ingredients are generally not irritating and it is something to do if you\u2019re looking for a temporary glow. It will not transform your skin and it will not get rid of your hyperpigmentation and/or redness. I would not recommend this to a friend and I wouldn\u2019t buy it again simply because the results weren\u2019t remarkable. I rather spend my money on something else. However, if someone were to gift me this or I happen to have another jar of it then I wouldn\u2019t mind using it again for funsies.",

That is it ! I'm not saying it was right; but I have always had beautiful skin. I have no immune system, and between my age and all the meds I take on a daily basis, I look terrible. Trust me the days of the Pandemic Covid with wearing a mask and my big sunglasses was a blessing.This is the best facial mask I have ever used. It is not harsh, and I am only sorry I did not take before and after pictures. My face is glowing. Don't think about purchasing it...DO IT !",
