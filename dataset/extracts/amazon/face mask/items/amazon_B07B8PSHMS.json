I have very sensitive skin & work in the med field so using a cloth mask is out of the question . So i tested these out . The packaging was good & no odor at all . Because they are black & some reviews stated that black residue was left in skin after use, i wanted to test them before wearing them . I took an alcohol swab and wiped the inside of the mask about four times & no dye , no particles left on the swab . I gave it 4 stars over all because after about 30mins the back of my ears hurt. Now this may vary , given that not all ears are created equal lol . They are snug which may be why the elastic isnt as stretchy thus causing discomfort after wear. Other than that they are well worth the $ .",

                "reviewText": "These are good. I use them when I cut grass. Fits comfy. No issues.UPDATE: I've used these for over a year even before Covid happened. I had a couple elastic bands snap but no big deal bc there was 100 of them. I wear them primarily when I cut the grass. I've had a couple of health issues. A few times my lungs felt like they were burning. I chocked it up to my health issues and the summer heat. Then as I ran out I placed orders for a couple other brands as this was not available and Covid made masks hard to come by. For the rest of this summer I wore the other masks I had purchased. Guess what? MY LUNGS DID NOT BURN. I do not know how these are made or under what conditions but they were the cause of what felt like my lungs burning. I also noticed sometimes after I cut the grass and shower I blow my nose and my mucus would be gray with some black. It took me a year to put all this together. The price is good but my guess is they are cheaply made. I will not be buying these again.",

                "reviewText": "I got these a year plus ago and had plenty when COVID hit, however these are CHARCOAL FILTER.They look like surgical masks, but they are designed to filter pollen and allergens, things that *smell*.They are not rated for anything wet and while Charocal can filter bacterial agents, Virual (like covid) are too small for charcoal filters. I would not recommend them for anything other than filtering out allergens, which is exactly what I got them for.I had friends betting for them, and I watched as these went out of stock and became a major shortage item, but these *are not* what you want for protection against Covid. you'd be safer in a good quality fabric mask or a N/KN95 mask.Not dinging them for that. They are great for filtering allergens. I've used them around smoke, food allergens, dust, pollen - filters them out nicely.Just don't buy up 100 thinking \"this is a great deal\" and use them for Covid.",
