                "reviewText": "I've been buying the light blue WeCare face masks since last June, and found them as advertised - individually wrapped, inside a box that is also wrapped. One point: the box is not quite as pictured here on Amazon. It only says \"individually wrapped\" on the lid, and nowhere else. I nearly returned my first box unopened, because it didn't state \"individually wrapped\" on the front, sides, or back. I didn't look at the lid! But luckily I happened to notice the print on the lid before I took action; on unwrapping and opening the box, I found that indeed the masks are individually wrapped.I've been using the WeCare brand of masks now for eight months. They have performed very well, and not once have I had an ear-band break or separate from the mask. I branched out to this butterfly design just a month ago, and everything I said above about the light blue masks applies to this design as well. I did notice a *very* faint scent when I put the first butterfly design mask on my face. But is was so faint, and dissipated so quickly, that maybe I just imagined it - because I was concerned about possible odor from the dye when I decided to buy them.So, all thumbs up. It's a pretty design, and the material is as soft and breathable as the light blue \"standard\" WeCare masks. The only negative is that the price for the butterfly design has increased 25% ($5.00) since I bought mine a month ago. I can only hope it goes back down before I need to buy more.",

                "reviewText": "I just ordered a second set of WeCare brand disposable face masks. The first set I ordered was the butterfly design. These masks fit well, don't have an odor, don't itch and have an adjustable wire across the nose which is important to me because I wear glasses. The second set is the spring design. I like the fact that they are individually wrapped. I work in a hospital and these masks provide the coverage I need and the thickness for safety. I have given several of the butterfly masks to coworkers who like them as much I as I do. I will say these masks run a bit larger across the face than other brands I have bought, but I have an oval/round face. This suits me because my ears don't pull forward like with other masks. However, my coworkers who have smaller faces adjusted the elastic part with a knot for a tighter fit and are pleased with the overall appearance and quality of the masks.",

                "reviewText": "This box of masks is not as good as the previous box I bought from the same brand. The purpose of buying my own disposable masks was because the ones at my workplace were low quality with loose fibers on the inner mask surface which drove me crazy. From this box I've used less than twenty and at least five of those had annoying fibers. The ear loops also feel a bit tighter and bother my ears faster.The colors are nice and I enjoy coordinating to my outfits. The nose piece is comfortable and adjustable. The ear loops are soft.I took one star off because the quality of this box was inferior to my prior box from the same company. (Same everything as before except my choice of color)",

                "reviewText": "I work as a nurse so I\u2019m required to wear masks more often than most. These masks are not only fun, but the most comfortable ones I\u2019ve found! They are soft against my face but don\u2019t shed in my mouth. I\u2019ve ordered several times and will continue to use these. It\u2019s an added plus that they are individually wrapped so I can toss them in my bag, glove compartment, and pretty much anywhere without them getting dirty or ruined. Highly recommend!",
