The material where you breathe is easy to breathe through while minimizing moisture accumulation. Having worn an older balaclava today, I am acutely aware of how much warmer and comfortable this mask is to wear.For me, this mask sets a new standard for what I will look for when this one wears out.",

                "reviewText": "Here's the short of it: YMMV. I found the uppermost edge of the lower face portion too loose.the bag i received indicates a \"medium\" sizing.if there was an available sizing option, i didn't see it. that MIGHT make a difference.IMO, what would work better (but i'm no tailor/seamstress/master of cloth and maker of apparel) would be if the uppermost edge of the facial part were stretchy/snug, from temple to temple (at the \"hinge\" of the balaclava) with the breathing panel and really, rest of the arrangement remaining as is.In terms of general comfort, it was soft, not scratchy and the mesh panels felt good. I wasn't outside exerting myself, so i can't comment on how well the panels worked, held up or were altered by heavy, wet, repeated in/ex-haling. IOW, IDK how well this product and that paneled area manages to actually insulate moisture from the face.as it is, i have about a 7-3/8 or 7-1/2 hat size. sooo...for me, with the item i received, the 'round the head portion is pretty snug and the above the nose part is loose.take a look at the seller's photos:-the guy with the skis on his shoulder? that looseness in the face/temple area is how mine wore.-the guy above him (photoshopped with a desert dunes background -- that's kinda odd, but whatever) with the upper head portion tightly fitted? that was my situation.-the person wearing full goggles and a ski hat, two to the left of the first guy i mentioned? i'm calling BS on this, cos that gap between foam-seal-against-face-goggles and the top of the balaclava is going to be what \"prevents\" fogging of \"glasses or goggles.\" UNLESS that lower portion is super snug, and UNLESS a person is wearing goggles with that air gap, i'd say it's almost a certainty you'll get some measure of lens fogging.Really, that comes down to what eye-protection is being worn FAR more than a reflection of this product's impact.what i found, after trying it on last night and walking about (it's below 20deg F here, ATM) is the upper was too snug for me to make much of any adjustment on the facial part, and with the facial cover part being loose, for the 5-10 minutes i worked with this while outside in the yard (with our dog wandering and handling business), i was in a perpetual state of tugging at the face part, trying to get it to come up and STAY over my nose/below my eyes, which then flexed open the \"hinge\" part at the temples (where the upper and lower/rear portions meet), allowing cold air to rush in.tug the lower portion back down, and it's no longer lined up over my nose and face, but the temple area is closed.tug up and...well, you see where this is going.i fought with this and just couldn't get a good fit.i've worn enough head/face/neck products over the years to know that with this arrangement:- i'm going to get aggravated pretty quickly by the incessant material wrestle.-any eye protection/covering i wear will result in fogging as the looseness above the nose will ensure my exhalations rise right up rather than out the mesh/vented breathing panel, unless i leave skin exposed between the two.-i'm going to go back to layering separate components (neck gaiter/face shield/beanie or suitable cold-weather hat) that, independently do their thing, and collectively, complement one another.is my described arrangement convenient or ideal as would be something like this, should it have a better fit? no, but playing the cold-weather head/face/neck gear lottery while out in the elements for an extended period of time is no place to find your big ticket only managed to match a couple of numbers.FWIW, i don't have a lightbulb-shaped head.had high hopes for this item. alas; back it goes.think i might look at something like this, but without the upper head part. then it becomes a matter of how well that face/neck portion stay up, as well as discovering how well/poorly breathing panels keep respirated moisture away from your face.",

                "reviewText": "I just went walking up a hill in 38 degree weather wearing this balaclava. It was very easy to breathe through the mesh. I will say that you can wear this two ways. One is over your nose when it is really chilly and then you can pull the mask down under your chin if you want less warmth.I found this kept my neck warm but also did not make my head sweat like other hats and balaclavas tend to. When you are active and moving around that is important I think. I also liked that the balaclava covered my forehead at the top.This seems to be windproof and I wish I'd had it a few days ago when I was out in the wind and forgot to bring it! This time I put it in my pocket and used it right away when it got colder. To staying warm out in the winter weather!~The Rebecca Review",
