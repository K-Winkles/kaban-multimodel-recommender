                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Soft, Breathable & Effective Disposable Face Masks",
                "reviewText": "Despite being more expensive than most other disposable face masks, I love this one! It's large, roomy, soft, comfortable, breathable, and the design makes it fun to wear. It fits both small and very large faces/heads, and it doesn't press tightly against your mouth so you can speak and breathe easily for hours on end. The fabric is significantly softer and smoother than all other disposable masks I've used. The ear loops are sturdy, stretchy and very soft as well, which means better comfort after hours of non-stop wear. There is a wire to adjust well over the nose.I love that each mask is individually wrapped which is more sanitary, easier for packing and traveling, and also occasionally annoying to unwrap quickly. There are way too many masks in the box that are all folded, creased and bent out of shape. For such a high price ($25 for 50) I expect the masks to be in better condition. But they are all too tightly squeezed into the box... Since then I've also purchased the tie-dye multi-pack and most of the masks are in good condition. Except some of them have little fuzzy hairs sticking out on the inside, which are itchy and annoying. But overall, I'm very pleased with the cool designs, the effectiveness and comfort level. Definitely a good face mask to fit all sizes. I've bought this for friends and family members who all LOVE it. Try it!",

                "reviewText": "I received my masks today, a box of 50 , and couldn\u2019t wait to write a review ! I have many homemade and store bought cloth masks but within 30 minutes at work I have to change it out to my old standbys , the blue surgical masks. They are the only ones I can stand without feeling suffocated , overheated , and the dreaded glasses steaming up. Probably because they are lighter weight. I decided to check on Amazon to see if there are any surgical like masks out there that were anything other than the standard blue ones. When I found these , they also offered many other colors and patterns but I chose these. I tried one on right away and I was so happy! Feel light on my face , no ear discomfort, the colors are vibrant , it has a wire inside to shape around your nose , and the best part , they are each individually wrapped ! They have 3 layers of protection but honestly they feel so light on my face you wouldn\u2019t know it. I did test it by trying to blow smoke through one , but none went through whatsoever.I can put a spare or two in my purse and car , and it stays clean and will keep it shape.Wearing a mask is beyond a pain for me , especially at work all day, but finding these totally made my day !! Ordering another box right now !Thank you !!",
