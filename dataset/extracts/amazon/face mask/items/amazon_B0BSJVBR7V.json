                "reviewText": "First and foremost, I have a pretty large adult head and this mask fits me just fine. Granted, when you take it out of the box and first look at it, it does look small - I thought there was no way that it would fit me. However, as you can see from the pic, it fits just fine (I wound up adjusting it higher on my nose after this pic and still a very good fit). Other reviewers indicate that it does not fit/is too small. However, based on a few of the pics posted, I think the reason for that is that they are putting it on upside down! I think they're putting the part that should be by the chin by the top of the nose - you can try this out for yourself and see how it will not fit right if you have it upside down.I really like the material - is very comfortable against the skin. The adjustable straps and the bendable nose piece make it fit well and stay in place. I have a somewhat flat nose and things tend to slide down but not this mask. I did an outing today to run numerous essential errands and the mask worked great. Now, I must say whenever I have had to wear a face covering for things like fumes or sawdust, I would feel suffocated (more anxiety than anything, kind of like being claustrophobic). However, I felt little of that sensation when running my errands today which was a pleasant surprise.I ordered two packages of two for a total of four black masks for my family. My teenage son has been using his regulary and he likes it a lot.I gave it four stars for value. With the need for good quality masks being a newer thing, I'm not sure if the pricing is excellent, but its at least good. I have been searching for masks that are very good or better quality and at a decent price. This has yielded few options so far. Many are too thin (or not tightly woven material), have no adjustable nose piece, and/or have no adjustable straps. This mask has none of those negatives and you get them for around $11 per mask. (NOTE: Make sure the seller is Copper Compression per their notes about knock offs being sold by other sellers; the other sellers\u2019 versions are cheaper, but if they are indeed knock offs, their quality is likely not as good.)I am going to order a box of two of their white ones at the request of my teenage daughter who is not satisfied with just having a black option.The one suggestion that I do have for the manufacturer - please offer a few more colors and/or some patterned ones! There are a lot of nice looking other masks in many colors, designs, etc., but they don't meet my specs for quality.",

                "reviewText": "Let me state first: any mask for protection needs to fit snug and require the wearer not need to be fiddling with it while wearing. This mask fits snug, but if you open your mouth it pops off the chin. Material quality is great. Nose bridge wire is great. Size is smaller than depicted in the advertised photos. Shorter. Does not go under the chin as advertised in the pics. Does not fit like the photos advertise. Not a mask to wear if you plan to be talking while wearing it, either your nose or your chin will pop out. There is no stretch. I\u2019d say this would fit kids faces well. In fact the only reason I\u2019m not going to return them is because I have 2 kids these will fit and the quality of the product feels and looks protective, copper inside or not. If this company made these exactly as the pics advertise these would be 5 star across the board masks. But sadly, I feel they falsely advertised this product. Disappointed but not a total loss.",

                "reviewText": "I bought one of these masks at Target and have been very happy with it. It's one I've felt secure wearing all day at work and when shopping. I ordered the small/medium but as shown in the second photo the larger one behind the top one is obviously quite a bit bigger. The side by side photo is even more obvious. Disappointing to say the least. Too bad, it WAS a good product to begin with. After following the instructions in the package to soak in hot water, I dried thoroughly and was hoping they would shrink down to an actual Small-Medium, but no. They're still so big I can't keep them on my face. Unfortunately, I won't be able to use these. I'll have to give them to someone with a much larger face than myself.",

                "reviewText": "I am not sure if I received a bad pair or if others rating these are real reviews. I truly cannot believe how badly these are made. The ear loop \"adjusters\" cover a seam in the elastic on the ears. If there's a seam, it should be hidden, not in back of your ears. The mask is also very small, it would fit a child, but a normal-sized adult will struggle to keep this up on their nose. The ear loops are also not long enough, so while this might work on a child, it's not going to fit your average adult. The material is stiff and feels like lightweight cardboard, making it quite uncomfortable. Again, I question whether I actually received the same product described by other reviewers, so I've included the brand on the side and the packaging.Pros:- none that I can discernCons:- ill fitting- stiff-scratchy- ear loops with knots- ear loops too short- too smallI would NOT recommend these!NOTE: Even though these are PRIME, you cannot return them! Your only option is to call Customer Service and request a refund.",
