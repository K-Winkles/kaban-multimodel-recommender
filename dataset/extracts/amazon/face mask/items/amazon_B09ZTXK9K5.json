Went skiing at Vail in -25\u02daC (-13\u02daF) temperatures 2 weeks ago and the mask blocked the wind chills on neck and face, didn't feel much cold at all to be entirely honest. The mask has a good length to it so I never worried about it slowly edging off as my helmet moved throughout the day. I did feel cold in my hands and feet, but that has nothing to do with the ski mask. I'm extremely glad I bought this before going to Vail.",

For hot weathers works really good. The sewing looks strong and high quality.The bad thing is that it doesn't fit like I would like to. The neck part is too baggy and doesn't look right to me. The costure in the mid-forehead can sometimes disconfort you when used with a work hardhat (which applies pressure on the costure over your forehead).I think it is hard for one same size to fit everybody, I would suggest to split them in two sizes to differenciate big from small heads.",
