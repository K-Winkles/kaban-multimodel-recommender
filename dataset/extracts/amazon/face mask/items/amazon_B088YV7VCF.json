                "reviewText": "I bought these masks on brand name reputation. Gildan makes good and popular t-shirts so I felt comfortable knowing these would be made well. As expected, they are. Sewn well, soft, quality material. Great deal, 24 for $18 which would give me enough to last until I do laundry without being price gouged. They wash really well too. They are 100% cotton but the shrinkage was minimal in hot water and dryer and like all cotton fabrics, stretch with use. The mask fits well but the ear loops were snug. After using a while, they fit fine and I didn\u2019t even feel the mask on me. It covers under the chin and sides and it sits high on the nose so no falling down. I did, however, get really hot! This is a couple of layers of cotton against your face. It\u2019s a little difficult to breath through the mask but it gets easier as you wear it. I don\u2019t mind since it is tightly woven which helps resist droplet transferring. That said, yes it did steam my glasses at times but not badly and not constantly. We have to wear them, and these are great.",

When I tried them on they were to big but after I washed them because of course you must wash them and I dried them for almost an hour now they are PERFECT. I\u2019m highly allergic to any other mask material I developed some kind of rare dermatitis around my mouth due to others mask. I like Gildan clothes so I figured why not try them well I\u2019m loving it. Can\u2019t beat 24/$9 awesome I can changed them couple times a day and don\u2019t need to worry I have to wash them before the week is over because 24 is more than enough. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a I hardly ever leave reviews but I had to in case someone out there is allergic too. And it\u2019s made in Nicaragua. I will buy them again if need to",

Having this many, I can keep some in my bag or in my truck Incase I need them or anyone around me needs one.As an adult male, these fit ok. I did wash them in cold water and air dried them but they still shrank significantly. I also have a medium beard, and while these do fit me even after washing, the masks are kind of small (My beard has some to do with that, I know.)It will serve its purpose if I have to wear one. Not sure how comfortable (or effective) these are if you had to wear them, say in an airport for several hours since they are cotton. It feels like wearing a sock across your face. It\u2019s kind of weird.",

                "reviewText": "I originally bought these for my son AND daughter-in-law for work because everyone there needs to wear the same color (black). They each only had 2 which they were constantly misplacing.At FIRST I was kind of disappointed because I had to order others for my son. Being an average 32 yo male, they were just way too small for him. HOWEVER on the UPSIDE, my daughter-in-law was absolutely THRILLED!! She was so happy to FINALLY wear a mask that she didn\u2019t need to constantly pick up OR tie a knot behind her ears. THING IS, she is actually about the same size as my 12 yo granddaughter. SO, I would say that she probably should have looked for smaller masks (like those made especially for children) all along. A good fitting mask is ESPECIALLY INVALUABLE when it needs to be worn for 8-9 hours at a time, whether at work or school.SO the inconvenience of having to order others for my son was absolutely NO PROBLEM given how HAPPY his wife is.",

                "reviewText": "While Gildan did a nice job on fabric selection and quality sewing, there are no nose wires on any of the masks, and the ear loops are so long that I'll have to modify them. I have a normal sized adult male head.The nose wire is essential if you wear glasses, I feel.I kept these because I found I could slip in a 3.5 inch long piece of 14awg bare copper wire inside the nose trim. I haven't decided how to best tackle to excessive ear loop length, but they lack enough elastic to work without some sort of adjustment.It's would be great if Gildan would fix these basic issues, which would then make them a 5 star mask, even at double the price.",

                "reviewText": "I found out my younger daughter is allergic to disposable masks and her school requires solid colored masks. Bought these for her to try and they are the most comfortable out of the three brands we tried. The fruit of the Loom ones were very rough and thick even after washing (we bought them directly from their website), the Hanes (from Walmart) were too thick to wear all day for school. These masks are a bit big for her but she ties a knot on one of the ear loops and it fits fine. These masks are not thin but not too thick to be uncomfortable for an all day wear. They are also soft and do not irritate the skin.10/4/2021 Update:I purchased these masks from three different sellers. The masks were great from two of the sellers but from one of them, I had to toss the whole batch. They looked fine out of the bag, soft and clean. However, when I hand washed them, fabric \"dust\" (as if the fabric was decaying) and tiny round black dots that looked like dead bed bugs were in the water. I rinsed the masks six times, and each time had the same amount of dust and black dots. I didn't want to waste them but couldn't risk using them either. However, the other two batches worked out great.10/23/2021I have tossed the other two batches I purchased due to tiny threads coming off into the water when I washed them. I don't want to risk my daughters and I breathing in the threads throughout the day.",

                "reviewText": "You definitely can't beat the value of these masks, however I was disappointed by how large the ear loops were. I later realized I should have looked for masks with adjustable ear straps. The masks themselves were generally too large (I bought medium) but they shrunk a bit when I put them through the wash which helped a bit. Really, the ear loops are the most annoying aspect: I would need to adjust and stitch each loop (there's 25 masks so 50 straps to fix....). Although the value is seriously great, I think I would recommend starting with adjustable masks before taking a risk with these.",

I had previously ordered the 3 ply ones made by gildan and they fit every member of our household and slightly too tight on most of us. which is better protection. These masks fit no one. They are huge! Im not sure if i got a bad batch but we are a household that always need large or extra large bike helmets These leave big gaps around everyone on the top and bottom. Hopefully this helps someone else. If you have a huge head. Wide face and ears that sit at the back of your head you may have better luck. Also the ear straps are very think and are difficult to use with the plastic head straps.",
