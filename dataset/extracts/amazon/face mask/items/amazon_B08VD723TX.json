                "reviewText": "I received my masks neatly packaged in 2 packs of 50. They were sealed tightly, almost airless, which is good to keep stuff out!I opened one pack hoping they didn't smell badly like other reviewers said, & thankfully they had NO smell. Totally odorless.They are lightweight, breathable & as comfortable as these things can be. The ear loops are soft & stretch enough to fit most. The fabric isn't super soft, but it isn't rough, nor does it have those itchy fibers I've had in other masks.I am a hairdresser & have to wear a mask all day, 8 to 12 hours, so I really need a mask that I can breath through, & one that doesn't itch my face all day! These are great for me.They are, indeed, 3 layers & offer as much protection as other masks of this type, I would imagine. I've been using this kind of mask for a year + now with no issues. These are exactly like the ones I got from Costco, only those were $10 for 50 masks, where here I got 100 for $11. A much better value.This is my experience& I hope this helps you decide if these are right for you.",
