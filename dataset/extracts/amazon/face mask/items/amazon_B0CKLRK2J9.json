Then apply the blackhead remover mask on your face (avoiding the eyebrows, eyes and lips). Create a thick layer with Silicone Brush.Step 2. Leave for around 15 minutes to dry completely.Step 3. Gently peel off the black mask. If you have quite a lot of blackheads or small hairs, it may hurt. But keep the wonderful result in mind \u2013 soft, smooth blackhead-free skin you will get.Step 4. For best results, finish with Toner to tighten the pores.Caution:1. Keep out of reach of children.2. For external use only. If redness or irritation occurs, discontinue use.3. Don\u2019t use it on your acne or inflamed areas.4. Avoid direct contact with eyes. If contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.Tip:Some may find the mask too watery, and it's dripping even after a long time waiting. The reason is that the mask contains very moisturizing ingredients to prevent dry skin. Please apply a thin layer onto the face first, and add another layer if needed.",

It didn't hurt at all and it left me feeling really refreshed. Not to mention this is really affordable and you can spread the mask liquid in every crevice and corner to get everything out.
