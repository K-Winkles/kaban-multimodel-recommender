                "reviewText": "I have and used a lot of different masks at this point so I know what I\u2019m talking about. These are extremely comfortable even for all day use and that for all areas of the face. They are comfortable around the mouth and the nose in the ears. I don\u2019t get with all the negative reviews are about because these are built at least as good if not better than any other disposable mask I have used. And he seem to hold up much better than multiple uses than any other mask I bought.The masks also seem to have a better range of fit. They fit well on my smaller child but they also fit better on my adult head. Part of it I think is the high-quality elastic and the other part is the accordion design of this mask allows it to expand and contract to fit the size better. It seems really well constructed.If you were glasses you know how annoying it can be for them to fog up so the nose piece and a mask is very important. Many of the disposable masks use a thin piece of plastic as a nose piece and that doesn\u2019t work very well because it tends to straighten up after a few minutes and let air up through the top of the mask. These mask use an actual wire so when you forward them to your face and actually stays that way.If you were glasses you know how annoying it can be for them to fog up so the nose piece and a mask is very important. Many of the disposable masks use a thin piece of plastic as a nose piece and that doesn\u2019t work very well because it tends to straighten up after a few minutes and let it air up through the top of the mask. These mask has an actual wire inside a flat plastic strip so when you form them to your face it actually stays that way. If there was no plastic strip around it it would flip around and not stay around your nose. I discovered this the hard way while trying to use a paperclip to make my masks better.Part of the reason of this masks comfort is it\u2019s breathability. I don\u2019t know how that speaks to effectiveness but it\u2019s important to understand that these are not the masks that one would wear to protect themselves. You wear these to protect others ( or if we\u2019re going to be real about it, to give the impression that you\u2019re protecting others because nobody really knows ) I have to assume because these are more breathable and cooler which means they\u2019re not trapping heat, that they are probably a little more porous as well. But when I examined the center layer it almost appeared to be made of some kind of rubber. And yet it is breathable. I am not a material scientist but they state that it is melt blown rather than woven. If you research what this means you\u2019ll find that this allows for both protection and breathability. when I held both of these up to the light even taking into account the color, clearly the hospital mask is much thinner. And harder to breathe through by the way. One things for certain, these masks stay dry even wearing them all day in a humid climate. My other masks start to feel like washrags by the end of the day.On the box it seems to make no specific claims at all to the masks efficacy other than a vague \u201c Health protection\u201d statement. ( but at least there\u2019s no disclaimer as on some other masks that seem to have no other purpose, medical or otherwise, but cosplay) Yet these seem to be less porous and made out of thicker and stronger materials then the mask I got it at a major hospital. In the pictures that\u2019s the one that\u2019s cut up. As much as it doesn\u2019t make sense these masks seem both thicker and more breathable. It may have something to do with the fact they\u2019re made of a non-woven material and they come from a combat factory in ChangZhou. It\u2019s quite possible these are military grade masks. they are clearly made to a higher quality standard and from better materials. Look at the seams in the way the elastic is attached and the elastic itself. Every visual aspect of this mask speaks to a higher quality.They also don\u2019t appear to be blue masks simply dyed black. After the fact. This looks like they were made from the very start from black materials. And cutting these up I found no trace of any other color. And again the color it doesn\u2019t bleed at all which Helps confirm that the masks were made from materials that were already dyed and washed.The fact remains that if I have to wear a mask all day I wanted to be comfortable without bleeding color anywhere else on my person, clothes, and furniture. These fit the bill perfectly. All at a price that doesn\u2019t make me feel like I\u2019m being gouged.The masks are black but they leave no die or residue at all on my face. I have not had a single issue with that. So whatever die they\u2019re using for the fabric is working well. The ear loops are also black which looks much better than the black masks with the white elastic.They also came very well packaged being triple wrapped and sealed. Some people have noticed a strange smell coming off of these which is completely normal for many medical items. Mine smell like hospital stuff. They don\u2019t smell noxious or caustic, so I don\u2019t really have an issue wearing them but if you do you can hear them out for about an hour and the smell goes away.Whatever material these are made of actually holds up from a light handwashing. You can get multiple uses out of these things and seeing as nobody knows how long we\u2019re going to need to be wearing masks, not wasting anything seems to be a wise idea.",

                "reviewText": "Due to COVID, I needed something to supply my office staff with, as well as provide to clients who neglected to bring their own. I wanted them to be as comfortable as possible, as anyone entering our building is required to wear a mask at all times. I ordered a total of 7 different brands in order to determine what would be the most comfortable or best all around option.These are, without a doubt, my #1 favorite out of all of the other brands that I tried, and I've since ordered several additional boxes. Plus they are black, so that's even better.They are very soft and extremely comfortable (even at the 10 hour mark) yet they feel secure and well assembled. Something I noticed, which I'd never really thought of before, is how well they hold up to the moisture in your breath. Most of my other masks would be a bit sad and droopy after talking into them all day, but these guys stay crisp and starchy far into the evening. Never would have found that to be so impressive if I hadn't allowed myself to spend so much time on this relatively pointless task.The fit is perfect for me, where the average mask may be just a bit too large for my face. They may be a tiny bit small for someone with a particularly large face, but they should be ideal for everyone else. For anyone wondering, the masks arrive in a plastic inner bag, that you will find inside of the box, but each mask *is not* individually wrapped, so there is ***much*** less waste when compared to some of the other sets I've received.They are advertised as not being surgical grade, and are not appropriate for environments with a high risk of transmission. I work in a law office and we are diligent in regards to social distancing and frequent hand cleaning, so I am hopeful these masks will suffice, though I cannot speak to whether or not they will.The only non-glowing part of this review is the fact that it took like 4 additional days to arrive than the others. I was fully aware of this before ordering them, and they actually arrived several days ahead of schedule, so this is far from a complaint, and I think the wait was well worth it.Great, great, great masks. You'll love em. Or maybe you won't and I'm just a crazy person spending way too much time while writing this from the toilet. I guess you won't know unless you try em out, but you're curious now, aren't you?",

                "reviewText": "These are fairly comfortable, I got a big face so it\u2019s not as comfortable as other masks I\u2019ve purchased. They are light weight and good value for money but I have found that some of the ear loop strings weren\u2019t applied very well, this is common with mass produced items like these. Several of my masks instantly had to be disposed of since when I pulled them out of the bag for the first time and I\u2019d go to put it on the string would just disconnect from the mask and you can\u2019t just tie it back on, I suppose you could make your own hole and knot it through but that\u2019s not why you\u2019d buy these",
