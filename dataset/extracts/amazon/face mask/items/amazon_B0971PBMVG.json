                "reviewText": "UPDATE: JUNE 9, 2022If you read my original review below, you will see, like many other reviews, that I mentioned a smell. A lot of people call it a chemical smell.Since my original purchase in February, I have tried three more brands of KN95, and one brand of KN94. You know what? They -all- have a similar chemical smell. Read about the different layers that make up the mask. That is going to have a smell!So what's the solution? Open the package and remove the mask. Hang it off your wrist while you walk or drive to wherever you're going. Put the mask on. If you notice a smell at that point, you won't even think about it two minutes later.So today, I came back, changed my former 3-star rating to 5-star, and ordered two more boxes.These masks are large enough for an adult male, and the loops are long enough, they don't pull my ears out of shape. The mask itself is large enough to easily breathe and seals well against the sides of my face. I wear eyeglasses. The wire on the nose bridge is better than literally -all- the other brands I tried, creating enough of a seal that my glasses don't fog up!Another factor that I have learned to appreciate is the masks are individually wrapped. Put one in your pocket and it's as good as if it just came out of the box.Other reviews mention that quality has changed, or the masks are low quality. Again, I reordered today and already have the new masks this evening. They are the same as I received before. Don't listen to the hysteria! \ud83d\ude1d",
