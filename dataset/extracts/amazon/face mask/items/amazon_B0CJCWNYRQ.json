                "reviewText": "I've been looking for some good quality hydrating masks as my skin gets really dry this time of year. One thing I really like about these - or any hydrating mask - is not having to immediately wash it off after. I've always felt they do a better job when the serum can soak into the skin for a while.The instructions say to apply the textured side onto the face. Perhaps it was just me, but I literally couldn't tell the difference from one side versus the other. The masks come in two pieces. It took a bit to unfold, then get them into place. I didn't mind having two separate sections since it's sometimes easier to smooth them out. Unfortunately, the eye holes didn't match up very well and I ended up getting some of the product in my eye as I was trying to adjust it (I don't typically have this issue with other masks). Next time I'll probably just cut a couple slits into the corners. It did have a nice cooling effect once I finished straightening everything out. There was also plenty of extra serum left to apply after removing the mask. My skin did feel soft and more hydrated the next morning. These seem to be a good value and are comparable to similar ones I've seen in the stores. I definitely plan to use up the rest.",

I like the fact that there is a top half and the bottom half to the mask. It makes it easier to put on. I think they do slip a little bit so it's best to be laying down for the 10 minute. That you leave the mask on.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first time trying a gel mask, and I'm impressed. These leave my skin feeling extra hydrated and looking plump. In comparison to jelly makes, which need to be mixed, and sheet masks, which have a tendency to drip and dry out more quickly, these are easy to use and can stay moist much longer. When I placed this on my face for the first time, my initial impression was that it felt too cool. Next time I might place the package in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes prior to using it. I left mine on for about twenty minutes, and there was still extra serum left over to squeeze onto my face. I like that these come individually wrapped, so I can take these with me when I travel or I can toss a mask or two into a gift basket.They come in two pieces, which makes these more customizable for unique face shapes. I tried using this while doing my evening chores but had to lie down to use them because the bottom portion kept slipping down. These are great for those who want to be pampered, but aren't so great for multitaskers. Overall, this was a pleasant experience, and I'm looking forward to using these again in the future.",

                "reviewText": "These come in a nice product box. They\u2019re made in Korea. Ingredients are listed on the box. The box is a thin cardboard that\u2019s folded into a box. There\u2019s a flap on the side that can be pulled out to open the box but then under that flap there\u2019s another flap that needs opened before getting to the masks. It doesn\u2019t seem the most stable. The box seems kind of thick but the 5 masks fit in there without a bunch of extra room. Though, they would squish down if a thinner box was used. I personally will take them out of the box for storing just because in the box they\u2019ll take up way more room. The same info that\u2019s on the back of the product box is also on the back of each individual mask packet (benefits, ingredients, directions, etc.)The 5 masks are each individually wrapped. Inside each one there\u2019s 2 separate ones - one for the top half of the face and one for the bottom half of the face.I\u2019m honestly not a huge fan of sheet face masks. They\u2019re always so hard to get open (slimy and slippery with all the product on them, folded in what seems like such an odd way because I can never seem to get them unfolded easily, always afraid of tearing them as I\u2019m unfolding them, etc.). I thought I might like a hydrogel sheet mask better than regular sheet masks. I was wrong. They\u2019re annoying too. This one was slightly less annoying since I wasn\u2019t as scared of tearing it as I am regular sheet masks, but aside from that it was just as annoying. It was hard to figure out unfolding each half. They are also just as slippery and slimy feeling so unfolding them was just as hard. Having 2 separate halves is nice since a full sheet mask can often not fit exactly and having the 2 separate halves allows for more adjusting.When wearing these, you\u2019re supposed to leave them on for 10 minutes. It says to apply the textured side on the face. But, for me, it was hard to find the textured side. I don\u2019t know if it was all the product on the mask or what. But, I think I used the textured side. But, it still slipped and slid down my face unless I was laying down.It was COVERED in serum and there was still a ton of serum left on it after 10 minutes so I waited another 5 minutes. Once I removed it there was still a lot left on the skin and I tapped it into the skin like it said. But it still took about 10 minutes for the excess left over to actually absorb into my skin after I finished the mask. So after wearing mask for 15 minutes, there was still a ton of serum left on my skin and after tapping it in, it still took another 10 minutes to actually absorb into my skin since it was just so much! I was surprised! I have normal to dry skin, more on the dry side. Where I live it\u2019s getting colder and with the weather changing, my skin has been extremely dry. With how dry it was at the time, I thought for sure my skin would drink it right up! But it didn\u2019t. Not sure why. I do feel like this felt really refreshing on the skin. It has a very cool feeling to it that makes it feel nice. It definitely moisturized my skin well. It didn\u2019t feel or look dry after. It looked and felt moisturized and had a subtle glow. I don\u2019t think it did anything for my pores, but maybe continued use will.Overall, I like this mask but I don\u2019t love it. For me, it\u2019s not really something I can\u2019t get from serums or my current masks (Skyn Iceland). I like to be able to do things while I wear my mask. So having to find time to lay down while wearing the mask always keeps me from actually using the masks as often as I should. I just never find the time for myself to lay down and wear them for the 10 minutes it takes. I prefer masks I can apply and walk around doing things or at least sit and read a book or watch a show or something while wearing it. For me, I\u2019d rather a pay a little more where it sticks to my face and isn\u2019t slippery and the outside of the mask is like cloth and doesn\u2019t have product on it (like the Skyn Iceland masks). But, if you have no issue taking 10 minutes for yourself to lay down and do a mask, then this mask feels very refreshing, moisturizes really well, and gives a subtle glow to the skin! I give it 4 stars!INGREDIENTSWater (Aqua/Eau), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Gum, Polyglycerin-3, Chondrus Crispus Powder, Panthenol, Hydroxyacetaphenone, Allantoin, Betaine, Xanthan Gum, Chlorphenesin, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Cellulose Gum, Glucomannan, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Chloride, Dextrin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Honey Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Thunbergiana Root Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Iron Oxides (CI 77491)",
