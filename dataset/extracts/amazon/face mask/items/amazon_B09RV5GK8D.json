                "reviewText": "After trying dozens and dozens of masks for the past 3 years, these are the very best of this style of mask!!I love that they are 4 ply instead of just 3 and it is just as easy to breathe through them as fewer ply masks. They feel sturdy. I was in the hospital recently so I had to wear a mask pretty much 24/7 and I found that these are extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time and I felt secure that with the 4 layers it would keep me from catching anything in the hospital. I also love the the muted colors, especially the butterscotch colored one. I wish they made full boxes of that color, it\u2019s so pretty. I know fit is an individual thing but these fit a large face very well. There\u2019s not a lot of gapping at the sides of the mask when it\u2019s on. Also they don\u2019t have any weird smell when you open them up and it\u2019s great that they are individually wrapped. It\u2019s the only mask I will be buying and using from now on.",

                "reviewText": "I work in a doctors office where masks are still required and I wanted something cuter than the default ones we are given. The only downside to these masks is that the loops feel a little tight and wear on my ears halfway through the day. If I hold them with one hand on the ends attached to the mask and stretch them out with the other hand, that helps significantly. I also just have a big head. I love that they're individually wrapped. I also love having a variety of colors in one box, I like being able to match them to my outfits. They're very breathable and comfortable on the face, the bendable bit in the nose is very helpful for wearing glasses with them.",
