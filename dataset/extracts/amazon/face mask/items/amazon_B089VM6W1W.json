The ear loops are a little thicker and have more cushion for behind the ears making it very comfortable to wear. Straps are secured very well to the mask which has been not the case with other surgical masks I\u2019ve ordered.2. The strip for the nose conforms nicely and maintains shape extremely well.3. Definitely 4 ply. In case you were worried it wasn\u2019t 4 ply, we compared them to the 3 ply surgical masks and cut a used one.4. Breathable. Easy to breathe, even in humidity outside. (A mask in humidity is never fun though regardless, but we\u2019re doing our due diligence.5. Worth the money, this is less than you\u2019d pay for other 4 ply masksI already put in an order for more as well as sent the link to multiple friends. This came in 4 days earlier than the original date it said it would.Overall more than pleased with the quality.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for 4-ply masks because my pre-pandemic masks that I loved are running out, and that listing on Amazon has been replaced by 3-ply masks that are not the same. I still like my old masks better, but these are pretty good replacements.I took off a star mostly because these masks are quite large, and the nose strip has too much fabric sticking up above it, rather than having the metal piece flush against the top of the mask. However, they are quite comfortable, have good breathability (much easier to breathe through than the common pastel blue masks), the ear loops are soft and stretchy, and the overall quality is very high. Plus it's a pretty green color, which is a plus.I found a video showing how to knot the ear loops to make masks smaller to fit better, and all the other masks I've tried that technique with have broken when doing that (the ear loops separate from the mask). In contrast, these masks are sturdy enough to do so without breaking.They arrived packaged together in sturdy plastic inside a box that you can use for storage and distribution. My shipment came fast and the box arrived in good condition. They are definitely manufactured in China, as the box (box version 2 in the description) states that the manufacturer is Guangzhou Fuzelong Hygiene Material Company, Ltd. in Guangzhou.These masks are a bit pricey, but you get good quality masks for the money. I recommend them, and in fact already have recommended them to my friends.",

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t know very much about masks.First off, packaging is like #2 type, with all masks wrapped in a sealed plastic wrap. If you\u2019re careful, you can cut a slit in the plastic wrap and use the box to house and dispense the masks ( the box is made that way). In the future, maybe the box could be thicker, and Amazon could care enough to ship them in a small box instead of a thinly padded envelope.Even though these are Chinese made, they feel as if they are of high quality. Good construction, nice fit from under the eyes to well under the chin. The sides feel as if they are touching my face all the way down.I work as an electrician and wastewater plant operator. Raw wastewater has the potential of having Covid-19 in it, from \u201coff-shedding\u201d of sick people. Therefore, so I can sleep at night, be together with my wife, and have a clear conscience, I wear a mask anytime I\u2019m at work, or outside of my safe space in my truck. That being said, I want to be comfortable, and the mask to be as functional as possible. It\u2019s not political, it\u2019s the right thing to do, for others and myself. I really wish we could all get on the same sheet of music on this!Today, I worked in 90\u00b0 sunshine replacing a pump, by myself. It was hot, but not unbearable. If you ever served in the Army, and wore a M17 rubber mask with a MOPP 4 charcoal suit, and rubber boots, you\u2019ll understand what hot is. Just slow down, go stand in the shade for a few minutes, then go back to it, until you\u2019re done. The alternative here, just isn\u2019t good!One thing with ear loops: Tie a small knot about a 1/4\u201d from one end or both ends to get a tighter fit. Also, to hang a mask below your face, make yourself a mask neck hanger from small alligator clips, attached to a couple of old ear loops, tied together and knotted through the end of each alligator clip. Then attach the alligator clips to the ear loops when not in use, or you\u2019re away from everyone. I realize this is not 100% optimum, but it\u2019s better than placing a used mask in your pocket to get dirty or contaminated, or not having a mask when you need it. Believe me, it will stay cleaner hanging down from your neck (well away from your face). Keep your mask hanger in your pocket, with a clip attached to a belt loop. That way you don\u2019t lose your hanger!Good luck everyone. Peace \u270c\ufe0f",
