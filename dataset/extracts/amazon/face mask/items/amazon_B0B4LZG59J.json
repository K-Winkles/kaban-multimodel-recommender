            "A COMFORTABLE MASK FOR LONG DAYS: With soft stretchy ear loops, adjustable nose bridge and side pleats this face covering feels barely-there! Even on a breeze-less day, you\u2019ll still feel fresh under this disposable facemask. It\u2019s 3 layered support, but won\u2019t create a heated situation underneath.",
            "NEVER RUN OUT: With 50 masks per bulk box, and many hues to choose, there\u2019s a mask for every outfit, every season (like fall masks) and everyone. Size: 7\u201d cheek to cheek / 6\u201d top to bottom for men and women! Fashionable and supportive, it\u2019s just what you need to Embrace Your Mask Ritual. VIRTUE CODE."
