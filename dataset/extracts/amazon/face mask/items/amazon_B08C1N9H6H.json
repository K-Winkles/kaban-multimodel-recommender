I even have worn them to exercise in. The ear loops are very comfortable and soft and don\u2019t hurt my ears. The ear loops may seem a bit tight at first but they stretch a bit and will feel better the more you wear them. They don\u2019t however stretch so much that the mask becomes too loose, at least not in my experience. They also feel thick enough to do what they are supposed to do, help keep you from getting sick!",

These however are THE BEST bar none.The material is the biggest factor here. Because of it these babies retain their shape, offer no struggle breathing, fog glasses less than other masks, do not muffle speech, stay in place during conversation, fit snug around chin, face and ears (no digging in the ears) and is comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time. I also appreciate their overall shape and simplistic design and color. They come three in a pack and hey, washable too!!! I\u2019ve only had to buy one replacement so far because I keep good tabs on these ones and I\u2019ll keep buying them as needed.",

                "reviewText": "Love these. I had previously bought the coral/ fuschia/pink 3 pack and loved them! They are extremely breathable and fit perfect on my medium sized face(I'm a 5'11\" woman with an oval face shape so often masks are too small or don't provide enough coverage. I wear Glasses and HATE Them fogging up... These allow enough air flow, but still tight enough fit(when ear slides/ tighteners are added) to provide full coverage. Only flaw I see are they don't come with the adjustable pieces on the ears so they easily flop off your ears if you don't add them.. otherwise the smaller size that wouldn't flip off the ears would be too taught and pull on your ears(unless you use a behind the head band to hold & adjust them). I have added ear adjusters to every pair(now 6 pairs) I have. They do have an irritating tag inside the face, but once it's cut down and washed a few times(they wash perfect & I always wash before wearing) the stub of the tag frays and is not noticable when wearing after a few washes. The color is ideal for matching with any royal blue apparel & stays vibrant and bright). Haven't used them for working out, but often I am working outside and they are light and breathable no matter my level of exertion.",

I don\u2019t know if I got a defective batch, or if they changed the size they make the ear loops, but I\u2019d be hesitant to purchase again as this most recent batch is unwearable.",

They are quality and durable as well.I was nervous to purchase these masks because so many reviews complained about the fit and I am shocked because these truly fit fine.First off, its Adidas, so generally they really are flawless when it comes to sports wear considering how long they\u2019ve been creating sports wear for men and women.Secondly, I am a male adult who is 5\u20198\u201d and weighs nearly 200 lbs (a bit overweight) and these fit my face perfectly. My ears do not bend in some weird way and my chin and nose are perfectly covered by the mask.In my opinion, purchase the medium/large masks if you are average adult. If you are petit or tinnier than most adults or are looking to buy this for your kid, then I assume the small size will fit perfectly.",

I ordered the x-small/small size and it was too small for an adult woman both for face coverage and from pulling on my ears. I could only see them fitting someone very petite or a child; I'd suggest ordering the medium/large if you're debating. There is a second layer of fabric inside the mask that could allow for a separately purchased filter. There is no metal in the nose, but the mask has a nice form to it without it.",

                "reviewText": "I first bought these masks in the summer of 2020. As stores started reponening and masks became mandatory, I found that the disposable masks were uncomfortable. They were either too large or too short, my glasses would get fogged up, and they were very hot. I had just started going to the gym and found working out with a mask very unpleasant. After Googling for a good mask to wear, I found an article that listed these Adidas masks. I got this exact size and color and wore them for 2 years, until I lost one and my dog ate the ear loops off the other 2. So finding these on Amazon was a blessing as some places still ask you to wear a mask and not having one was inconvenient.These masks fit perfectly on my face. Yes they are tight behind the ears at first, but that's to be expected of an elastic that you wear for the first time. It's also supposed to fit snugly to your face to give some droplet protection. These masks are soft, very lightweight and breathable and because the fit is so perfect, no fog on my glasses. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a reusable mask. Great product!",
