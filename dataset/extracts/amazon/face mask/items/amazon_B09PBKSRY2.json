                "reviewText": "Sigh. Just as soon as I find something I love/that works for me, it disappears.Such is life, but still...This feels oddly similar to how it feels when Netflix inevitably cancels a show that I loved three seasons too soon.So, much like a heartbroken fan does to a canceled show's production studio I'm here seriously begging you to bring bring back the houndstooth pattern masks!This would have been my third time buying them, and since nearly no other companies/manufacturers bothered to come up with anything other than florals (ug), paisleys (SO much ug), dots and other juvenile designs (I am neither Mini Mouse nor five years old) and what seems like an endless sea of basic solid colors and other brightly-colored ones (like a lot of people I don't have the coloring for that), I don't think I would ever stop buying them as long as they stayed the same construction/design. They are soft and comfortable, and don't cling to the face like so many other types do.I loved them so much I bought them even though I could only wear half in the package. This was the case because I am (truly) cursed with *very* muted but warm-leaning coloring \u2014 most purples and blues and any pure colors or cool-tones look terrible on me \u2014 so I couldn't pull off the non-neutral/cool-toned ones; I just gave those to friends and family who could wear those color palettes, but, seriously, that's how much I loved the neutrals, I was willing to pay for ones I couldn't use for the pleasure of using the ones that worked for me.There's just something about the pattern that make people compliment them. Houndstooth is a classic. It's oddly geometrically pleasing, and I guess it's sort of sophisticated without being stuffy or pretentious. It's like plaid is when it's the kind of plaid that lacks the backwoods hunter vibe (on that note, why weren't there more classic neutral-toned plaid masks produced? Think Burberry-inspired plaids! I would have loved those as well).On another note, they also fit my (relatively small, female face better than most of the masks I've tried. So many masks are so large they literally sit ON my eyes at the top and hang below my chin on the bottom. Huge. These were probably a littlelarge for me, but still well within tolerances.Boo for discontinuing the houndstooth (bring it back, please please!)!!",

The designs are very cute as well, and I like having options to pair with different outfits and occasions.One thing I will point out is that as someone with asthma and restrictive breathing problems, these masks have left me very light-headed at times due to the constricted air flow. If you do get these masks, I would like to make it clear that you need to breath slowly and regularly to help prevent significant negative effects. It's great to know that these masks are helping minimize how much contaminated air I'm taking in, but its a bit worrying at times when I'm finding I'm not taking much air in at all. Please mask up, but be safe while doing so.",

Eventhough the KN95 are the best during the pandemic it is really difficult to breath in for lo g period of times. This is what I use when on crowded trains, buses and plane. I love the multi colors. They go with all my outfits to. I highly recommend for the comfort fit.",

My boyfriend complained when wearing them on an airplane, overstimulated by the fraying. I enjoy that it does not touch my lips as well. They do their job and are cute but beware !",
