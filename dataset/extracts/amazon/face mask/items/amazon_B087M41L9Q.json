                "reviewText": "Of all the masks I've tried, this is the best for me. I ordered 15 and use a new one every day, throwing them in the wash with the darks. I'm a petite woman with a small face, and most masks I've tried are too large. Some of those other masks are workable but uncomfortable, and some are just comical. This one fits perfectly to my face. But those with larger faces might also like it - my fiance has a wider face and thinks it is comfortable too. The ear straps easily adjust for wider faces.I've seen some complaints about the seam in the middle, but that should only be a concern if you care about aesthetics. The seam on the inside is indented and soft, and is not bothersome or uncomfortable. The seam on the outside does protrude a bit, but because the mask is black, I think it is not noticeable. So far no one has pointed and laughed, so there's that. I think it is nice aesthetically because it fits well and is basic black.This passed the \"candle test\" - I wasn't able to blow out a candle while wearing it. So while of course it isn't a medical-grade mask, it is better for sure than single-ply, 100% polyester, or neck gaiter face coverings. It is fairly breathable - certainly better than others that I have. It fits snugly to the face, so if you want something looser around the nose and lips, this probably isn't the mask for you.Finally, it folds up fairly compactly to slip into a pocket when not needed.",

                "reviewText": "Usually when I would wear a mask I would always keep it down around my chin when I want near anyone because most of the masks I had were uncomfortable, not a good fit. The fabric didn't feel right, the mask didn't look right on me.I like the shape of this mask. The nose portion can be pulled all the way up to the upper nose between the eyes and then curls down underneath the eyes rather than straight across. I thought that gave mask a better appearance when wearing it. The picture usual looks better than the actual product, but the pictures provide were accurate to what i received.The fabric is soft and stretches. I don't have any difficulty breathing when I have it on like I did with the majority of other masks that I've worn. Sometimes I forget I'm even wearing it when I have it on.The only thing that I didn't like was that the ear straps were painful for a little while until I got used to them because I like for the mask to fit snug (somewhat tight) over my face and because the straight are somewhat thin (like most masks), then start to hurt my ears after a while, but after a week or 2 of wearing it I feel a lot more comfortably than in the beginning.I will order again when I'm in need of more masks.",

                "reviewText": "My husband has a very difficult time finding masks that fit him properly (he has a wide face), many of the masks he finds are way too tight to be comfortably worn and does not prefer the tie kinds. The mask itself is very light weight while remaining durable. The straps are VERY elastic so they are able to stretch to fit my husbands head comfortably, but they are also adjustable so my children can wear them as well (ages 9 and 12- petite). All in all, I would highly recommend these masks for the whole family if you want something soft, durable, and versatile.",

They are very comfortable (to the point I forget to take it off sometimes), they don\u2019t suction to my face when I\u2019m breathing (but sometimes when running), and they\u2019re adjustable. I\u2019ve purchased three packs so I can rotate through them and don\u2019t regret it one bit.Yes the ridge looks a little silly, but it makes ALL the difference!",
