They fit around my face well (I'm a bigger guy) as well as the rest of my family (they are smaller).So far I've had no issues and do plan on purchasing more. The only issue I had was that they arrived late. However, they are still worth it. I highly recommend these.",

                "reviewText": "Over the past 10 months we have purchased quite a variety of masks for our transportation company and I have personally used even more. These compare favorable with anything else in their category. They are durable, disposable, the ear loops rarely fail, I have heard no complaints about the bridge, although, I suppose it could keep its shape a little better. They stretch and are breathable. We have used them with 2 year olds and 80 year olds and most of the ages in between, largely with success. I found these to be a great value.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Switch and bait: the item description shows face masks packed into boxes of 50, but it was shipped in plastic bags without any boxes at all. More disturbing is that the seller decided to rip out a manufacturers label from every single bag. So there is no way to trace where and it was made and to what specification. Even more disturbing is because of that every single bag has a large hole. So all your masks (1000 of them) are exposed to any contaminants even before leaving the seller warehouse. Then it is exposed to everything at Amazon warehouse and delivery trucks. Who would put such a product on their face?Also the electric loops are so big, masks are sliding down your face immediately. That is coming from a guy with a size Large head.",
