Even with pinching the nose wire, they still ride up my nose. It feels like the top edge is resting at the bottom of my eyes and I am more likely to touch the mask to readjust rather than simply let it be. That's my only gripe though.The box of masks is divvied up into smaller groups of wrapped masks (4 or 5 each) so you can grab a package of a single color and keep them in your car, desk, wherever without them floating around freely.",

However the inside should have been black and it would have been better if each mass was individually packaged rather than in groups. Regardless they are just what I wanted and the arrived right on time as scheduled. Yes, I will buy again and again.",

                "reviewText": "We've ordered these twice now. As an immunocompromised person regular masking has been a part of my life since long before this latest pandemic. These are sturdier and thicker than the standard accordion style disposable hospital mask but not as thick as a certified N95 mask (like the 3M ones that have the contoured foam surround). The first time we ordered these, the masks themselves seemed to fit wider than this latest batch which isn't as full in the cheek. As a result of this change I think the latest batch has a better fit across the face. However, the earloops on this latest batch is also shorter than the first, resulting in the tips of your ears being pulled forward and pressure from the over-tight elastic resulting in ear pain. Some of the ear loops even slip off completely. So while these masks get the job done, the inconsistency in manufacturing can be bothersome. Not sure yet if we'll reorder again since trying to wear a mask that you have to fiddle with all the time kinda defeats the purpose.",
