These will keep that cold air from entering and freezing your ears and neck, nose if needed. Great quality with some nice stitching, warm but not thick, I also loved all the colors = 5 STARS!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the 6 Pack Neck Gaiter Bandana Face Masks for a couple reasons. These are great for when we are snowblowing or walking our dog to keep the snow and cold off of our faces. I may even use one for my dog on the extra cold days to protect her ears while outside. The other way I use them is as a hair cover to protect my curly hair while sleeping. The gaiters fit nicely, not too tight, not too loose, and are extremely soft like satin. My husband and I make sure to keep one in our jacket pockets because they are so versatile.I recommend this product.",
