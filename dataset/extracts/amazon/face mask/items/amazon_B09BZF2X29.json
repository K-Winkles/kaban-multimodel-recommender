They do come individually wrapped, despite what some other reviewers said. At least mine are.I have only tried one so far for a couple hours while shopping. They do not have a strong smell, and I have a sensitive sense of smell, so I'd know. The fit was fine. It didn't itch at all. If I had any complaint, the inner white layer that goes against your face was not as soft or thick as my previous ones, but they seem just as comfortable. I would definitely recommend them, especially on sale.",

                "reviewText": "I have asthma and was hesitant to purchase any kind of KN95 mask. I had searched for a mask that slipped on over the ears, was light weight, comfortable and allowed me to breath easily without feeling like I was suffocating. I was happily surprised to find this mask checked all the boxes and exceeded my expectations for quality. There are 50 masks conveniently packaged in groups of 5, which minimizes infection exposure by excessive handling. Masks selection was available in black or white, I chose black because it goes with everything. I purchased this product before the recent price hike by the seller. I was shocked after I purchased these masks when the seller hiked the price 100% and stalled my delivery until I consented to purchase at the new escalated price. Buyer beware! I was horrified to discover pricing had further escalated another 100% after my purchase. To combat demand and price hiking, I researched and discovered one can prolong usage by exposing worn masks to ultra violent sanitation via a UV Wand or UV Phone Sanitizer. I recommend this mask for protection, comfort, ease of use and easy breathing but I advise and encourage purchasing a sanitizing device to prolong the use of these masks. Without sanitizing, this mask can be worn 3 times without compromising your health and safety. Sanitizing after each use should allow wearing this mask until the elastic ear loops become too lose for the mask to fit securely and snugly against the face. I highly recommend using a phone sanitizer after using this mask as the best way to get your monies worth! The Seller\u2019s price hike after a purchase, stalling delivery until the buyer consents to a higher price is a shady business practice in my book. So again, I encourage the BUYER to Beware!",
