We all wear them under our hoodie and coat. I even wear it inside because it\u2019s comfy. Light weight but so soft and very warm. I do really wish they made more colors or hoods with animal ears or something because I will absolutely buy more. Seriously, please let me know if you make more colors/styles. =)",

I do not like my head/neck being constricted. this one is comforably loose and oh so comfy warm. I like to sit by my open windo in winter and having it on my head keeps me toasty. I usually do not like covering my mouth/nose, but this one does not bother me. Breating is easy even with the mouthpiec up. I purchased the leopard, blue, and beige ones. colors are crisp and beautiful.",

Even though I had a hood and beenie it didn't feel as warm and cozy as this was. Highly recommend. Buying a blue one for my husband.",
