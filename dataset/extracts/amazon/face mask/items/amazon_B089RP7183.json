                "reviewText": "My prime delivery box arrived packed upside down with the bottom of the box opened. This would be the fault of the Amazon warehouse. I bought from a different seller, but the order was fulfilled by Amazon. I did count and all the masks were there. These are very good quality for what they are. The ear cords are the finest quality they could possibly be, way higher quality than I was expecting, I have not seen such quality on any other disposable masks. They are super comfortable and strong with Lots of appropriate stretch. The nose piece is made of plastic, I would equate it to a plastic coffee stir stick. Please see the photo, by making three strong bends in it in the appropriate places with the mask off I was able to get it to fit securely on my nose. It did not move, and remained closed, not leaking my breath. I gave the mask four stars because it is not quite big enough, and therefore leaks my breath significantly from both sides. I have a smallish heart shaped adult face, this means I have a little bit more pronounced chin than other face shapes but not by much. However the mask was plenty long enough going from my nose all the way under my chin. The size issue with this mask is that the sides are not tall enough even though the middle fabric expands to plenty tall enough. The sides need to be an inch taller in order to fit my face appropriately with no leakage of my breath. I cannot see a man even possibly being able to use one of these masks. Although I do think that teenage boys or young adult men might be able to. With facial hair, no way. I would suggest making a test yourself of newspaper or an envelope utilizing the dimensions given for these masks, and seeing how it fits around the face before purchasing these masks. For anyone who feels comfortable purchasing these masks, I believe they are a good purchase. I will continue to endeavor to use my cloth masks most of the time, I purchased these for my emergency bag, etc., so they will not be my primary masks.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered 2 boxes, they both shipped neatly in an Amazon box with bubble wrap to protect them. Each mask is individually wrapped which is great for on-the-go or for sharing with family / friends - way more sanitary than 50 masks loosely packed in a single bag like I have purchased from other brands. The ear loops are thicker and softer than any of the other disposable masks I have ever purchased, super comfortable! The nose strip bends perfectly to fit around my nose to hold the mask in place. The mask material is breathable it is pretty comfortable overall. For the price, it was absolutely worth it! I would definitely buy again.",

We really like that they are individually packed, that provides extra reassurance to clients. Also, I have most of a box of masks at home left over from the pandemic and they have started to beak down, the blue material dissolves like dust when you pick them up.",
