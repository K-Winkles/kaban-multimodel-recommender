I love the variety you get (different masks do different things for your skin) and the quality is very good. Great ingredients and feels like a mini facial in every mask. Great way to help you wind down before bed or any time you want great looking skin.",

It ranges from everything you can thing of: moisturizing, firming, soothing and brightening. It was so much that I was giving them out to my friends and coworkers. LOLThere was even different types of mask included, the usual sheet mask and even a few 2 in 1 masks.",

I REALLY wish the eye holes were bigger. They sit on the outer corners of my eyes and pull up from the bridge of my nose. If I put them on my nose, they cover my outer eyes and I don't want product getting in my eyes. They seem to be child-sized. I have a small face and head but, not small enough, apparently. But the ones I liked, I LOVED.",
