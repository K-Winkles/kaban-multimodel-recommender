                "reviewText": "These masks are great. The inside layer is SO soft. Most other disposable masks cause facial irritation and I'm constantly reminded I'm wearing a mask. After just a short time my face is usually raw feeling but not with these masks! I wore this mask through the airport and on a flight and honestly forgot I even had it on. The loops are a little big for my face but it's easily fixed by tying a knot in the ear loops. This will forever be the mask I go to when I need one!",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to love these masks. I'd been given 5 black masks from someone who's mother was a health practitioner. I loved them! I thought these would be the same? They're not! I don't like the smell of the interior when putting it on. The sides seem to allow my breath to escape which to me makes no sense if I can feel air coming out upon exhaling? I've found some other masks that also do the same, I've used 2 masks to double up so this wouldn't occur? But these are too thick to use 2 masks at the same time. I really don't like these masks. I wish I could have my money back and just buy another black mask hoping it's the same kind I was given previously or just get the KN95's. I was just happy to buy something that was American Made. I'd heard some rumors about certain Chinese masks being shown to cause cancer. I'd heard the ones with the blue showing.. and so decided no matter what buy American made. But, I sincerely don't like this mask. So, I'll just need to buy something else when the time comes for some new masks. I'll figure out the best way I can use these since returning used masks aren't an option on Amazon once you've been using a product? But, I am disappointed with this product and I don't recommend it! Maybe smaller faces? I mean I hadn't considered my face large? But maybe it's the ear placement or my jaw as to why the mask doesn't fit well? The smell? That's the product so that'd be a choice? It almost smells like a wetsuit when you first begin wearing it.. the kind of smell like neoprene? It's weird.",
