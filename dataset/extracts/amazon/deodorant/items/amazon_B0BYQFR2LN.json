                "reviewText": "Where has this stuff been all my life?I'm a big dude. I sweat a lot. I don't like anti-perspirants for a variety of reasons, and most of the 'all natural' stuff doesn't do much for me.This stuff works. For two days, if I'm busy and don't get a shower in. I primarily used their white-container scents previously (Fuji, Timber w/ Sandalwood, etc.) and they worked fine - but often struggled to go 18h without the stank coming on, and I'd not infrequently get skin irritation. This stuff far surpasses the performance, with less skin irritation.Everyone's body chemistry is different though - so if Old Spice worked best for you before, and you like the non-antiperspirant version of their white sticks, this will probably work great for you. If you've not tried it or that other stuff didn't work... I dunno. Try at your own risk.-1 star because it's still too much **** plastic that I throw away every time I finish a stick. Wish they had a recycling program or something that I could send stuff back to.",
