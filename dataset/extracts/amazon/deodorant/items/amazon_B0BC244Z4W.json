                "reviewText": "The plastic free can be a bit confusing because the shipping via Amazon at times isn\u2019t the best. When it arrived it was shipped with a case of Almond milk which was heavy. I mean I couldn\u2019t have places in the box with my idk, pillowcases I ordered I suppose right. {insert sarcasm here} or even the small jar of Mayo. But by golly ship it with a case of almond milk so it squishes the be-jesus out of it. So the bottom cardboard piece fell off the deodorant. At first I didn\u2019t know if it was the bottom or top. It was my first time ordering the plastic free one. But it was the only logical fit. But I couldn\u2019t get it to go back on. But thank the good Lord someone posted a 16 sec video on how it works and I watched it a couple times and seen how you push from the bottom. Which I had been trying to do and nada! But ohhh, that outer pice you\u2019re look at is a cover that slides off the top. So I looked under it and seen two pieces of cardboard and grabbed my tweezers and pulled on the innermost tube while holding the outer covering and it slide right out. THEN I was able to slide the bottom piece back on that was knocked off during the delivery via Amazon. So now I know how it works. So I\u2019m good now. Fwiw, Walmart also sells Native brand items. I did pick up this scent a couple days ago while there because now my youngest daughter wants to use it as well. But this must be a popular scent but it was the last one in that slot. While all the others were still fairly full. I tell ya what. The body wash in this scent is also really good too. Kinda reminds me Old Spice with a tiny splash of Stetson. It\u2019s mild enough not to give a headache since I am sensitive to scents but just strong enough to give a hint of a lingering scent that smells good. And it\u2019s bigger bottles than Bath and Body Works and toxic free as well. You really can\u2019t beat that!!! As an avid BBW user for many many years. I love this! I\u2019ve recently started changing all of our products to toxic free and finding products that smell good but work can be difficult. So glad I found Native.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using Native Deodorant for years. The formulas and scents are great, and they're effective and aluminum free. The Lavender Rose scent is attractive without being overly sweet and mixes well with other perfumes one might wear.I bought my last Native deodorant in the new cardboard container, and I have to say, it didn't work well. I applaud the effort to avoid plastic and to create biodegradable/recyclable packaging, but the actual container didn't hold up. Within a week, the container was deteriorating both on the bottom of the lid and on the interior where it connects with the product. It seems the moisture of the product breaks down the cardboard making it wiggle and bend, and then it makes it harder to get in and out of the lid. It was ultra annoying, so I'm not sure I would buy that applicator again until they work out the kinks. What is inside is a great product!",

This moves almost too smoothly through the tube so I have to grip it tightly to keep it from sliding back into the tube during use. I like the cucumber - mint scent, it's fresh but not overpowering. I will buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love Native, they are cruelty free and their ingredients are clean. I also love the scents! Although some scents don\u2019t work as well as other ones but that\u2019s just for me. My biggest complaint is the packaging. I LOVE that it\u2019s plastic free and this is without a doubt a better alternative!! But it\u2019s not efficient. When I open and close it, it gets stuck. I store it without the lid because it\u2019s easier that way. Also, when you are almost done with the deodorant the whole deodorant piece falls out and you have to apply it holding it. Not a big deal but also not efficient compared to other products.",

I see EXACTLY what they are talking about.But there's a simple solution. .. just cut two tiny wedges in the lid like I did in the pic. One in each side. And it will open smoothly.I mean ideally the company should just make that change in their packaging. That will be easier.",
