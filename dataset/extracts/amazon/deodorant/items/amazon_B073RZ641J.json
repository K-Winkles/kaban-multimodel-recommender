Not white or residue I\u2019m hearing all the people talk about the ones they bought.. but it try it don\u2019t like send it back. Why can\u2019t everyone agree on a product that is 5 stars .. this is five starts because it works well . My arm\u2019s never smell bad . Always fresh. But i don\u2019t go two weeks without a shower.
