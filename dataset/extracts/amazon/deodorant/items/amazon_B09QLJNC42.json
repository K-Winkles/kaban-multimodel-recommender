                "reviewText": "I\u2019m been on the search for deodorant that prevents smell. I am not focused the sweating because I luv win Texas and the summer time is pretty steamy. Sweating is natural so that wasn\u2019t my focus on my quest for deodorant. It the was smell. My armpits would stink so bad and become so musky. I do not use Duradry by itself. What I have found that works is immediately after my shower I use a roll on deodorant, specifically Mitchum. I roll it right into my armpits, all over. It takes about 5-10 minutes to fully dry. Once it\u2019s dried, I apply Duradry right over. I\u2019ve been doing this for a month and the results have been 180 degrees for the better. Not only have I fixed the musky smell but the wet sweatiness is also no longer there. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t tried Duradry alone but I have used other deodorants for the second application and the results were no where near what I get when I combine Mitchum and Duradry. Definitely worth the shot if you are a heavy sweater kind of person. The smell of the deodorant is mid. I got the Endgame scent and it\u2019s okay. Nothing fantastic about the smell but it also doesn\u2019t smell terribly.",

If i do wax, I do it at night before bed and apply the deodorant in the morning so I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t irritate the skin. After a while, I noticed it stopped working for my underarms. I sweat like a mf especially when my anxiety spikes and it really helped in the beginning but now not so much. So I may need to explore deodorants again but it is good.",

I only sweat through if I take my herbal supplements that have thermogenic products in them so it's to be expected. I do suggest getting the wash as well because whatever is in this makes a film over your sink that is sticky to touch if you try to wipe off and it's meant to be resistant. It can clog pores if you don't remove it thoughly periodically.",
