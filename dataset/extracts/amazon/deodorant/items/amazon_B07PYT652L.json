Its clear so it does not discolor clothes (only when it is a day or 2 old and starts to dry out and flake, just like any other clear gel, or if you put too much on.) Its smells fresh, pretty generic clean smell but who cares, if you want something that smells interesting buy cologne. its lasts as long as advertised and great bang for buck. 10/10 would recommend.",
