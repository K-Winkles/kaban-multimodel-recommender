                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Product is great after a week of use",
                "reviewText": "I think this product is great after only about a week of use. I like it better than my last activated charcoal deodorant that I\u2019ve been using for over a year (history below). The application is a bit annoying but I\u2019ve been used to getting my deodorant from a small glass jar so this stick isn\u2019t really a big deal to me. My biggest concern going in was the smell. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the scent more than my prior deodorants. I notice a slight citrus overtone when I put it on and it fades throughout the morning. I was afraid that the stronger smell would be noticeable by those around me but my wife could hardly smell it through a t-shirt with her nose right up close. The crazy thing is that at the end of a full day 10-12 hours after application I notice a baby powder scent. It\u2019s mild and I love it. Laying on the couch at 10pm I still smell fresh and my arm pits seem softer than before. I\u2019m only a week in and things could change but baring any major changes I\u2019ve found my new deodorant.Finally the price is a great value compared to my previous choice. Larger amount for 40% less cost.My biggest fear with these small natural deodorant companies is that they will have supply chain issues, change the formula, or just go away. Schmidt\u2019s seems to have a following and a robust lineup of products so maybe my concerns will be unfounded.Background: After years of wearing Antiperspirant/Deodorant from major brands and finally Mitchum's and still sweating I decided to switch to a deodorant only. My first was Arm and Hammer's Essentials. It worked great and had a pleasant smell which wasn't strong smelling (I really liked the smell). The only problem with A&H Essentials was I started noticing a red rash in my arm pits. It didn't itch it wasn't raised my skin was just red. I kept using it for a while because who sees my armpits other than me. I mentioned it during a doctor's visit and they just said: sounds like you're allergic to something in it.I remembered seeing the Piper Wia pitch on Shark Tank so I went to their site and bought a container. It was pretty pricey compared to what I was used to spending and I was scooping it out of a little glass jar (LOVE!!! those little glass jars for reuse) but I liked it. So I've been using Piper Wia for over a year and I've even recommended it to other people. I started ordering it from amazon as a prime item for a couple of dollars more than the PW site because it seemed to take forever to ship and deliver. It was worth the $2 premium to get it faster. I started noticing inconsistencies in the product. It seemed harder and darker in color when I opened it up and I thought the scent had changed a little. It wasn\u2019t a huge deal and I chalked the first two up to the fact that it contained coconut oil which tends to solidify at colder temps. Then I started to notice that by the end of the day I was starting to notice my body odor using PW. I even felt like sweat had an odd smell almost spicy but I thought it could be my diet or some other factor.My last amazon order was delayed and I was almost out of PW. Then I was out and using my backup in my overnight bag so I went on the hunt for something new. I started my search for other Deodorants containing activated Charcoal and came across Schmidt\u2019s.",
