As of today, I still have enough on the stick for probably another month, but I just ordered another stick. So for five (5) months this wonderful product has been my staple and only deodorant. It still smells as lovely as day one and works effectively. No sweating smell at all.** This is your sign to INVEST in yourself and buy this little piece of heaven!Written Aug 11, 2023I first thought\u2026\u201dyou\u2019re nuts to pay $30 for deodorant\u201d, but after I bought it and use it, I had no regrets. It feels so smooth gliding on your skin. The fragrance is so subtle and lingers all day. I don\u2019t perspire at all. It\u2019s actually better than some store bought deodorants I\u2019ve read used in the past.Long Lasting: I started using it on Aug 11, 2023 everyday. Today is Nov 13th and there\u2019s still half the stick remaining. I expect this stick to last another month. That\u2019s incredible to get 4 months worth, which makes the price worth it.Splurge and buy it!!",

Unlike many other deodorants, it doesn't irritate my skin, though I did notice a slight itchiness after using it several days consecutively. However, this minor issue is easily resolved with a bit of moisturizer.",

My underarms have always become an issue in my early teens, but when I heard about this product on the Amazon website and YouTube, I had to try it out. After a few weeks of using it every single day, my odor and sweat went away. There's no stickiness and no strong fragrance to it. It helps me a lot whenever I work out at the gym or at work. It is a bit pricey but it's worth it, I give it 10/10!",

This deodorant is pretty pricey but so worth it. The scent is not too strong, it lasts all day and I love it. I purchased it more than a month ago and I still have a lot left. I am going to monitor how long one stick lasts. I definitely recommend it.",
