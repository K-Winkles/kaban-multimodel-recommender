        "description": "Step this way for beautifully soft, resilient underarms. Introducing Dove Advanced Care Lavender Fresh Antiperspirant Deodorant Stick, your after-shave care for underarms that helps your skin barrier repair with every use. If you love a lavender-scented deodorant, indulge in the calming aroma of this antiperspirant deodorant, which helps soothe and ground you throughout the day. Dove Advanced Care antiperspirant deodorant range features innovative Pro-Ceramide Technology that boosts ceramide levels in your skin, which are essential for maintaining a strong skin barrier. This increase of ceramides helps your skin barrier to repair and recover after shaving (especially as shaving can actually reduce ceramide levels in your skin). Using this kind-to-skin antiperspirant deodorant stick means your underarms can benefit from better skin care and some well-deserved TLC, without letting any shaving worries get in the way. Did you know that when you shave, \u2153 of what you remove is skin? Cue Dove Advanced Care Lavender Fresh Antiperspirant Stick, enriched with Pro-Ceramide Technology to help form a stronger skin barrier that can recover from shaving symptoms, like dryness and redness. With 72 hours of odor control, as well as all-day underarm sweat protection, it quickly dries on your skin, giving you silky-soft underarms with a lavender scent with every use Hold one arm above your head and use the other to apply your antiperspirant, gliding it on in light circles. Repeat under the other arm. Remember to wait a few minutes before applying your antiperspirant deodorant stick after shaving* \u2013 the formula works best on cool, dry skin. Don\u2019t just reserve this antiperspirant deodorant stick for the daytime \u2013 you can apply it before you go to bed, too. Sleeping with antiperspirant on means the nourishing formula has more time to set and protect your underarms, so you can wake up feeling refreshed and uplifted.",

I'm a supersmeller, everything you smell I can smell 10x's more - at least, and this scent doesn't bother me. I usually use unscented everything because I can't stand how strong products are.
