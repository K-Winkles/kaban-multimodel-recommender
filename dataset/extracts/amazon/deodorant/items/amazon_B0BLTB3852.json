This deodorant looked good to me cause it doesn't have any irritants and I love the smell of eucalyptus.Unfortunately, it did not deodorize me at all. It would make me smell nice for maybe an hour, but then my odor would come through pretty quick. Now, I think this product is mostly advertised towards women. I'm a man, so I'm probably stinkier than the average woman lol. I usually use men's dove deodorant (eucalyptus scent, of course!). But I wanted to see what this was like. If you're a man looking to get this, or a woman who may be a bit smellier in the pits, this may not work well for you.Also I have a lot of armpit hair, and it pulled on my hair while applying which was kinda uncomfortable. Something about the texture is more abrasive than other deodorants I've used.",

                "reviewText": "In summary: This deodorant ultimately failed to meet my expectations regarding scent and deodorizing ability. Waxy texture. Pulls your skin with it with each swipe. I like the lack of distasteful ingredients.I wanted to switch to an aluminum free deodorant. This brand seemed just right. I was excited for the sage & eucalyptus scent, even though it\u2019s a couple dollars more.I purchased the product several weeks ago and have been using it daily. The first thing I notice is the scent of course\u2026 I LOVE herbal aromatics that are pleasant, non-spicy, and earthy.\u2026What I come to realize is that this deodorant smells like a lemon.. I have grown up with eucalyptus trees all my life; the scent of their leaves is amazing to me. This deodorant is nothing like that OR sage. It should be advertised as a citrus scent or even a lemon bar food.. I hate to use food scents for cosmetics.My point here is: the scent is extremely disappointing and incorrect.Well, I can\u2019t return a used deodorant, so I have to stick with it. Through that, I notice just how mediocre this deodorant is at executing its purpose to deodorize. For around the house, I don\u2019t notice any body odor. What I also don\u2019t like is the fact that I can\u2019t smell the deodorant at all after an hour of use. I guess that\u2019s a good thing because I don\u2019t like the smell of it anyway..Now, after an 8 hour shift, if I check myself I can detect a faint body odor. It\u2019s only so bad that someone would have to shove their face into my armpits to be able to smell it. Still, that fact is VERY disappointing when I realize my previous deodorant never did that to me.My point with this is: the deodorant definitely does NOT offer 24HR protection as it states on the label. Maybe I have to absolutely CAKE my armpits with it to achieve 24HR protection. However, with such a waxy texture, why would I want to do that?? I am never using more than 7 swipes from a deodorant to get good protection. I guess that isn\u2019t enough from this brand.I can understand that it may be difficult to create a super-deodorizing deodorant that truly offers 24hr/48hr protection without common ingredients. Nonetheless, I am disappointed. Maybe asking for an aluminum free deodorant that deodorizes is too much from the Hello brand. Then again, $16? Um.. okay..I doubt I can return a USED deodorant, so now I\u2019m stuck with $16 wasted. Choose this deodorant if you have really small sweat/odor output and you like lemon bars. Will not buy again.. Very disappointed.. Gonna switch to Native and see how better off their deodorant works.",
