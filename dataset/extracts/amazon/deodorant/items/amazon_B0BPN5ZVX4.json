I just wanted something that smells better and lasts longer.This definitely smells super good and cant wait to try the other scents. Plus Im not allergic to it \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udd25 It also lasts all day which is shocking because normally these types of deodorant do nothing.My only issue is with this the mint scent it does stain on white shirts. Have not tried to bleach it out yet. Will be trying other scents to see if its just the dye color on that one! With other color shirts its not noticeable. (update 4/28 was able to wash it out of white shirt with nobleach so confident bleach would removed it completely!)Also love the look of the applicator but the deodorant kind of melts over the top of it when it heats up to your skin. So then you have it oozing on the sides and have to wipe it on your armpits before you close the lid otherwise its super messy.ALL of that being said. I personally will be buying again. Im happy to find one Im not allergic too \ud83e\udd73Update 5/22! Tried the vanilla scent also not allergic. \ud83d\udd25 This smells sweeter than I was anticipating almost like a vanilla cream cicle.",

This scent smells nice but isn't my favorite that they offer.This brand works the best of all natural deodorants. It will last long but some days I do have to reapply depending on how active i am. But I would rather have to reapply then apply aluminum chemical deodorants.",

                "reviewText": "I was excited because the ingredients seem great but it just didn\u2019t really work for me after 2 months of trying. I bought the unscented in order to avoid fragrance but it smells like play dough. It has to warm up or the application is rough, and it leaves a thick oily residue on all my clothes that looks like pit stains. I can\u2019t get it to come off so far. It last for a little bit but as a busy girl, I get sweaty and it can\u2019t handle more than 2 hours max. But what\u2019s really a bummer is that it\u2019s 12 dollars for a very small bottle, with messy packaging. Overall missed the mark for me.",

I smell delicious. But not everybody would want to smell like a chewed up piece of gum. I like wearing it because I find it really amusing. But if you have a normal sense of humor, you might not be so entertained.",
