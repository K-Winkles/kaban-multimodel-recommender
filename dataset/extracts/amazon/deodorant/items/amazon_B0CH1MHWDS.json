I have tried my fair share of aluminum free deodorants that don't work and instead leave me feeling moist with sweat throughout the day, but that is not the case with this one. Very comprable to other Dove aluminum deodorants but is instead a lot better for your skin.",

It\u2019s so unbelievably smooth to apply, and doesn\u2019t get \u201ccaught\u201d on my armpits. It smells lovely, and is not over powering.Honestly if I keep raving about this I\u2019ll sound like a broken record. Coming from a staunch avoider, to a believer I highly recommend this deodorant.",
