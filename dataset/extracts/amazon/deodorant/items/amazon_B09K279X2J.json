                "reviewText": "I love this brand of deodorant but be aware that the Sandalwood & Citrus scent is closer to scents usually marketed to men. I had to return this scent to get a more feminine smelling scent, just my personal preference. However the quality of the deodorant is such that it applies well to the skin, does not irritate my skin (although I don\u2019t have sensitive skin), and it prevents odor from accumulation of sweat throughout the day. It\u2019s well worth the money to buy this brand because it gets the job done and they have scents that will appeal to almost anyone. If you have sensitive skin you may want to do some research before buying as baking soda can be harsh. For non sensitive skin, which can also break out from baking soda, it is less likely you will have any issue as they have many ingredients that will reduce the harshness of the baking soda while maintaining odor-blocking effectiveness. I have tried Crystal deodorants, Pit Liquor spray and even handmade so I can avoid aluminum deodorants, but this is the best for my money as it is extremely effective and a little goes a long way.",

                "reviewText": "I hate spending $10 on deodorant. I've spent up to $20 and never felt like it was doing anything. I usually just buy on sale from the grocery store... till now.First, the cons. These don't last nearly as long as the big-name brand in-store versions. When I apply it, I have to hold it against my armpit for a 5-count just to make sure it's heated up enough to apply. As someone who's been using deodorant for 35 years now, this was off-putting at first. Oh! and your armpits will feel wet for a minute after putting on.After saying all that, I've subscribe/saved to this stuff. I'm trying to get away from the aluminum stuff I've been using all my life. Even though aluminum deodorants keep me drier, I still get stains in my shirts and my armpits smell at the end of the day. When the big deodorants do last, the scent is more like a 13-year-old trying cologne for the first time. For the minor inconveniences in application, it's worth it.This scent... citrus/sandalwood. I love it. I first tried the magnesium and charcoal. Scent was fine, but I didn't love it enough to keep buying it. Then I tried sandalwood/citrus. It just works for me. Maybe the others work for you. Because this stuff seems to be heat-activated, the more active I am, the better I smell; a complete 180 to my previous deodorants. Two days is too long, but when I put this on in the morning, it lasts till I wake up the next day.",

If the dial is sticking (& it probably will when you first use the stick) set it down & then try again 10min later, it seems to work fine then. Still, a little annoying. 5 stars nonetheless!",
