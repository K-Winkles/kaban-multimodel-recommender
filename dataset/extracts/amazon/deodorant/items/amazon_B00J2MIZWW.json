I\u2019ve tried it all lol this one works the best for me\u2026 however I find that certain flavors of it work better than others. \u201cSexy intrigue,\u201d which is such a stupid name for deodorant, but i always come back to it cuz it works better than the other scents. I need deodorant mostly for odor protection (because I killed my actual armpit sweating by using Maxim deodorant, also on Amazon, at night for about a year and now they never actually sweat/create wetness for like 4-5 years after and then I\u2019ll repeat the process and use Maxim for a few months and then I\u2019m good for another 4-5 years on the dampness front). But Sexy Intrigue keeps my armpits odor free for the entire day, which cannot be said for any other kind i\u2019ve tried.",

That only lost a short amount of time because I sweat like a wildebeest. I bought this deodorant and I can tell you without going into the clinical strength deodorants, this one does work for ladies who sweat like a wildebeest. It does last and I don't sweat through it during the day. So if you want a good deodorant, that smells nice so you don't smell like In and Out Onions ( California people know what I mean) , get it. It's good \ud83d\udc4d",
