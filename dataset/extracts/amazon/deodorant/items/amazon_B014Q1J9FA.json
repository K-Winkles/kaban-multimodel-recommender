It has a pleasant, light, fresh scent, that doesn't overpower.My only gripe is the prices on all the clinical strength antiperspirants; they are all expensive. That, and the way the applicator is designed, where you end up leaving some of the 'cake' behind because it's unobtainable. This is not only aggravating (because, you might be in a hurry, running out, but can SEE it in there) but simply wasteful. At least make it easier to pop off the top and get to it. : )",
