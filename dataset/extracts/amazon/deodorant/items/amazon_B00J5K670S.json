I\u2019ve been through a few \u201cnew fav deos\u201d (which were 2x as expensive btw) only to find the manufacturer is no longer producing them. Or something\u2014no longer available. But this (hopefully) will end my search.I looooove the scent. The listing says \u201cFresh\u201d scent but the packaging says \u201cRosemary Lavender.\u201d It doesn\u2019t smell overwhelmingly of either of those ingredients but it does smell kinda herbal and fresh. It legit lasts 12 hours. If you forget to put it on every 12 hours, you might start to smell a bit ripe after 18 hours but if you reapply it does a great job of making you smell ok again (but also start thinking about a shower you dirty dirty).In summary: everyone please buy some so they keep making it so I don\u2019t have to find a new one!!! \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude4f",

                "reviewText": "I used to get rashes and deal with excessive sweating with a lot of other deodorants before I found this. I've never had any discomfort which I think is due to the natural ingredients. I also find that I sweat less even though it's not an antiperspirant. The scent is nice and keeps me from smelling. I'm really happy.",

I have used Dove for sensitive skin for years and it just got to the point of being too itchy and feeling like it wasn't washing off in the shower. I felt like I had layers of deodorant building up. The arm & hammer fixed all my issues. Really like this product!",
