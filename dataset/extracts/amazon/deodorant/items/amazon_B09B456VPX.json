                "reviewText": "Oars + Alps really does make deodorant that actually meets the claims that the big companies like to make. Wife approved (it was a birthday gift). She bought it for me because I was tired of using a big brand deodorant and wanted something a little unique.The scent:\"Aspen Air\" is my favorite scent of all of the Oars+Alps scents. It is very light, and airy but not floral and doesn't smell like laundry detergent. Deodorant is often to overpowering, like it's trying to double as cologne. This has a crisp, airy and sweet smell that's very light. It's only pungent as you apply it, and really it isn't that strong then either. As you go throughout the day the smell is there but only subtly. I've received compliments on the smell from men and women alike.The shape:This deodorant stick reminds me of the original Old Spice deodorant sticks. It's actually quite nice to hold. While it doesn't have the oval shape that makes it convenient for application across your pit, the circular shape is a nice throwback and welcome feel in the hand.I don't know how to say this without being subjective. This deodorant feels natural. I've used Speed Stick and Old Spice for years but they always felt... manufactured or man-made if you will. The smell, texture and feel of this deodorant comes across as though its made by someone churning plant based ingredients in a wooden bowl rather than a bunch of chemicals boiled in a giant metal vat. I dont know how to explain it but this stuff just \"feels\" better.It won't stop you from sweating. It's not anti-perspirant. IMHO I don't think it's smart to stop your body's important functions (like sweating). On days that I sweat heavily I don't smell if I use this. In fact I can apply in the morning, spend all day sweating doing yard work outside and then get in a 30min workout in the afternoon and still not smell nasty. Although at that point the nice Aspen Air scent is gone.Safe to say this stuff does its job. And it does it well. If your looking for an outside of the box brand and something more natural.. this is it.",

                "reviewText": "Been using aluminum free deodorant for about 4 months now, when I started I bought 5 different brands and rotate them to find a favorite. My notes:1. Oar and Alps Ocean scent - best smelling by far, really like this light clean scent. Downside is it's one of the weaker deoderants and requires a mid day refresher. 4/52. A&H Essentials Juniper Berry - seemed to be the cheaper, stock and standard and that's what it's become. Scent is light and inoffensive. Can just last a regular office day but not anything harder. 4/53. Huron citrus - stronger clean scent, like it a lot. Rolls on with white residue and while I haven't noticed stains on cloths I'm wary to use with anything dark. 3.5/54. Lume Tangerine and Powder - the tangerine is the most offputting scent out off everything, the powder isn't bad but a bit strong for a powder. While the scents are a bit disappointing Lume is by far the best controlling sweat and smell in both effectiveness and duration. Hate the deoderants roll on bottle, hard to control how much cream comes out, just go for the tube. 4.5/5, could be 5/5 with better selection and execution of scents. My overall winner and most used.",

                "reviewText": "This may work differently for someone with a different body chemistry but for me it did not work well I had to re-apply it multiple times a day and still found myself smelling badly. This is just one natural deodorant and a long list of natural deodorants that I have tried most of them do not work well and I do like the smell of this one but again did not work for me. The one that worked best for me was bravo Sierra brand deodorant, the ones that smelled best to me were Schmitz brand deodorant. But everybody\u2019s body chemistry is different and before I switched to natural deodorants a few years ago I used to use the clinical strength stuff so I may not be a good example for someone who is just an average under arm sweater. No natural deodorant stops you from sweating but if you find a good one that works with your body chemistry it will stop you from stinking so this may work for you but did not for me. I found myself having to clean my armpits with a little vinegar in the middle of the day and reapplying the deodorant otherwise even reapplying did not help. The bravo Sierra brand I only had to apply once during the day and it holds throughout even during workouts. The Schmidt\u2018s brand smells better to me but I do not like the texture of it, the bravo Ciara brand is much smoother application. This brand of deodorant has a pretty smooth application so I did like that I also like the container it comes in so those are the pros but again I did not like how it worked for me.",
