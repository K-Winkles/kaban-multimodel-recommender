                "reviewText": "I used another brand in a gel for many years. My last purchase just didn't work. Something was off with the scent and that was the start of me looking for something else. This Dove had a lot of really good reviews. I decided to give it a try and using a solid for the first time in many, many years was really stepping out of my comfort zone. The scent is nice but not heavy and doesn't linger. It definitely does the job when I get stressed or do exercise. I am so happy I gave this product a try.",

I have tried many brands, so this was a huge relief! I have been using this deodorant for years and it gives you the protection! Buying in store each can be $7, so I really love the value. Once I found this, I haven\u2019t gotten it in the store since!",
