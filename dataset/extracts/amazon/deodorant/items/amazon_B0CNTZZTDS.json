I have had some really bad experiences since trying to transition to aluminum free deodorants. I've tried Schmidt, Native, Dove, and Tom's. None of them worked for me and my extremely sensitive skin. Some of them burned and had my underarm itching like crazy. Even caused my skin to turn black and peel off. With this deodorant I experienced none of the above. No itching, irritation, or turning my underarm black. It glides on sheer but I'm a little heavy handed with my deodorant so you can see it. It kept me must-free through out the entire day, I didn't have to reapply. I was able to test it well over 24hrs and I was still skunk free lol. I can't vouch for 72hrs cause I can't see myself going that long. The smell was very subtle, I had to get close to my underarms to smell it. Not an issue for me just want to be sure that I'm not smelling like a bag of saut\u00e9 onions by the end of the day. 10 out of 10 for me, I've found my new deodorant!!",

                "reviewText": "I made the switch from antiperspirant & deodorant to just aluminum-free deodorant several years ago. I've tried other \"clinically proven\" aluminum-free deodorants that made me smell absolutely horrible - like something I've never smelled like before (starts with an \"L\" and ends with \"-ume\"). Obviously, that didn't work for me! I've since used different brands and scents of aluminum-free deodorant and I am SO thrilled that *finally* someone made a clean scent!! Not a floral or fruity or food-like scent, FINALLY!! This aluminum-free deodorant is now above and beyond all others for me, just for that reason. That said, this does not last 72 hours for me - not even close. It usually needs a touch up between 18-24 hours. I am totally fine with that! My body chemistry type is apparently just not well-represented in all these \"clinically proven\" deodorant trials - and that's okay! This aluminum-free deodorant applies easily (it's not difficult to apply like all natural alternatives) and does a pretty darn good job of keeping me anti-smelly even if I have to apply it more often that I'd like. It's a little pricier than some other options; however, this will be my go to deodorant from here on out! Or for at least until my body decides it's gonna stop responding to this one and I need to try to something else for a while. Did I mention that is has a nice, clean scent?!?! I absolutely recommend this aluminum-free deodorant and think it would likely work really, really well for most people!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using aluminum free deodorants for 20 years, but starting in my late 30's my BO took a turn for the worse! I'm sure hormones are to blame, but it's been very hard for me to find a deo that's aluminum free, and baking soda free that's actually effective. I did find one last year that works well for me (rhymes with roomy) but it's 15 dollars a stick, which is definitely on the pricier side, and I don't love any of the scents. So I thought I'd give this one a try, with no expectations, but the 72 hour claim really caught my eye. I haven't tested the full 72 hours, but I did go a little longer than 24 once, and was still perfectly odor free. Even on days when I workout and don't have a chance to shower until evening, this has me covered. I always apply at night, after I shower, and there's no need to reapply the next morning. The scent is pleasantly sweet and fruity, but very fresh. I will absolutely be buying this in the future because it beats my other brand in every aspect. Give it a shot!",

It's long lasting just as advertised.I don't know that I have quite put it to the 72 hour test, but I did put it to the full 48 hour test, and I smelled delightful (I promise, it's not just me -- my family said this too!). And I did a gym workout and spent half a day at the dog park in those two days, so it definitely prevented odors.It did not mark my clothes (often a problem with deodorants with aluminum), very sheer. No skin irritation at all, even when applying just after I shaved.*The only thing you should consider before buying is that it's not an antiperspirant. So, it won't stop you from sweating but it WILL prevent armpit odor. For me, odor is a much bigger concern that a little sweating, so that's fine with me.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using only natural deodorants for several years now but my teen daughter gravitates towards regular deodorants from known brands such as Secret. And that\u2019s why I was absolutely thrilled when I saw this new aluminum free Secret deodorant. My daughter has been using it now for about two weeks and she absolutely loves it. She plays sports and this deodorant keeps her smelling fresh through long practices and tournament days. She reports that it applies easily and it is not messy. It doesn\u2019t get her clothes dirty either. She likes the scent a lot too and calls it fresh, feminine, and not overwhelming. She said she will definitely get another one once this one runs out.",
