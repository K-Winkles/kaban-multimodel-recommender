I was nervous to raise my arms or even hug someone always thinking they are going to smell my sweat. But this deodorant is a game changer, when you put it on it can smell strong but that goes away. What doesn't happen is I don't smell my body odor. I smell nothing just my perfume. I don't feel self conscious when hugging or even raising my arms. This works so good and is long lasting. The only time I slightly smelled sweat was after a long day at the amusement park on a hot day. I mean it wasn't till I was home and changing that I got a slight whiff of sweat. I even had my husband smell my pits and ask him if it was bad. He said only if his nose is right in my pits could he smell it, other then that he smelled nothing. So of course I repeated this with my kids and I got the same results. I have found a deodorant that works and doesn't irritate my skin. My new holy grail of deodorants.",

                "reviewText": "This deodorant and this fragrance, specifically, are my go to for a year-round deodorant option.I'm a 50 year old male with fairly decent eating habits which means that my sweat is no longer as acidic or acrid as it used to be when I was in my twenties and early thirties. I also sweat a little less than I did back then as my system is in a better state of balance.However, be aware that this is not going to stop you sweating - it's not designed to do so, and I don't think that kind of product is healthy. Out bodies are designed to perspire for a multiple reasons - the process of sweating helps to cool us, and it also gives us a way of shedding some of the toxins we build up in daily life.What this does do, very effectively in my opinion, is to mitigate the odor which comes from the bacteria which feed on our sweat, and hence to keep you feeling a little more human in summer. I think it may also help to stop that fisrt very light sheen of sweat you can get when you get nervous (let's call it an arbitrary stage one perspiration level), but as soon as you start exercising it will work to minimize the effects such that you don't have offensive BO. In winter I find I'm odor free for 48 hours unless I break a sweat in that time which allows me to shower every other day without having the faintest trace of body odor.Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying this is the only \"non-aluminum\" deodorant that has worked for me, personally. I know a lot of people swear by natural name brands, but I feel like I've tried so many and they just end up making me change my shirts multiple times a day. I put non-aluminum in quotes bc one of the ingredients is potassium alum. I've decided to continue to use this since it works great for me (I have the lavender & white tea scent). It also doesn't sting after shaving like my other products do, and keeps my white shirts white. Definitely not 24-hr protection, though. Maybe like 4-5 hrs, then I reapply. *I still sweat with this, but it allows me to manage odor, which was my main goal.*The cons: in the specs on the product page, it literally says \"aluminum free\", twice. I am confused by this since they advertise having potassium alum in this product, and that it's better than the competitor's aluminum. Just because it's natural, doesn't mean it's not there. Pecans are natural, but you wouldn't put \"nut free\" on a product made with pecans. That makes it so that when you search for aluminum free deodorant, this one pops up, which is quite deceptive from the sale of a product that is also advertising that they wouldn't harm your body with things you wouldn't want to be putting on it as their competitor's products do... while simultaneously deciding on behalf of the consumer that potassium alum is not aluminum because the seller doesn't think it's harmful, when that should be up to the individual purchasing it.",

                "reviewText": "I have been looking for a natural deodorant and have tried several on the market. This is my favorite application that I\u2019ve tried so far! I like the roll on method because I have found other regular deodorants tend to clump up and make a mess when applying. The roll on goes on nice and smooth and I love that it\u2019s clear! Yes you may need to wait a minute or two to let it dry before putting your shirt but it\u2019s not a big deal.My reason for going with 3 stars is that the smell is very mild - which is fine for me because I don\u2019t like super strong scents. However, I have found that it\u2019s too mild because it doesn\u2019t cover up body odor for very long. It will for a couple hours maybe but after that it\u2019s useless unless your constantly reapplying. Ultimately it\u2019s better than applying nothing but it\u2019s not something that will last all day, especially if you are sweating a lot. I\u2019ve almost felt like the scent has made me smell worse compared to days I haven\u2019t applied it at all.Overall, I would say it\u2019s cheap enough to give it a try for yourself and see if you like it. Everyone\u2019s body odors and hormones are different. Personally my search to finding a good natural deodorant will continue.",
