                "reviewText": "I've used Lavanilla products before such as their perfume and deodorant however the deodorant wouldn't work for me I've used the sports one before and this time it had a different smell and I had to reapply it more than once throughout the day. Today, I noticed my underarms were really sore looked in the mirror and there's a rash now. I did see a couple other people with rashes but I didn't think that this would happen to me since I've used this deodorant before. This is not the same formula it smells different even goes on different. You can't say that it's aluminum free and then have other harsh chemicals in your product! I will not be purchasing anymore products from this company. I'm returning it and getting my money back. Save yourself time, money and no rashes or paid by avoiding this product at all costs!",

                "reviewText": "This is my favorite aluminum-free deodorant that I\u2019ve found. It goes on easily, and is not powdery. It goes on clear, in fact, and has not marked or stained my clothes- works well with tank tops or sleeveless shirts for this reason, even dark colors and whites. This is NOT an anti-perspirant, so the pits do get wet if you sweat. However, it keeps the smell at bay at least through the day for me, and my armpits are actually healthy instead of dry and itchy like they get with anti-perspirants. I have sensitive skin, and this has not caused any irritation, even when I have used it right after shaving. This one smells like soap to me- not perfume or powdery, but clean and fresh. It\u2019s a very gender-neutral smell. My only wish is that there would be less plastic use in the packaging, as the container is a pretty dense, hard plastic. If they could find a way to use more cardboard or something instead for the tube, at least, that would be great. Hope this helps.",
