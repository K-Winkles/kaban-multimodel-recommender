Does not stain my clothing.Also, I bought a 3 pack in mid August 2023, and in February 2024 I am still on my first stick. I estimate I can go another 2 weeks on the first one. So, 5 months of daily applications on one stick? Every other brand I get maybe a month of applications per stick.Spread out over time this is the most cost effective deoderant I have used in 50 years.",

I first tried this one in a cardboard tube called \u201chey humans\u201d or something like that, and it just didn\u2019t work. I smelled like BO as soon as I started sweating. Then I tried Axe (I know that was stupid, but it was the only men\u2019s deodorant that doesn\u2019t have aluminum that wasn\u2019t locked up) and it just made me smell like middle school locker room and BO. So I went on Amazon and found this brand. And (unless they start giving me a negative reaction like old spice did) I think I\u2019ve found the right brand. It works well, it smells good, and I don\u2019t smell like BO!",

I always used big brands until I started to sweat for no reason while sitting inside. Harry\u2019s finally made me stop sweating and feel confident in smelling good again. Last all day even with working out side. Also affordable as well. 10 out 10 would recommend to get off those heavy aluminum deodorants and try Harry\u2019s.",

At some have mentioned, the first few weeks was a bit rough for me- I'm normally not a sweater, but I was STANKY even having put this on. After a month of my body adjusting to this alumnimum-free deodorant, I'm not stanky anymore. There may be a adjustment period... stick with it and it'll work",

                "reviewText": "I have struggled to find a deodorant that I can consistently utilize that both controls odors as well as perspiration. I have used Harry's deodorant for the last year with a LOT of success and absolutely love it, so when my local store stopped carrying it and I couldn't find it anywhere else, I was pretty upset. Cue finding it on Amazon for substantially less than the store was selling it for--I had to buy it.Only problem was, I didn't notice this was the gel version and not the powder version (powder version is a darker blue color). I accidentally ordered the three pack of the gel and decided to give it a try anyway because I paid for it and the smells were nice. I used the Fig scent the first day.Cue the worst body odor I have ever had in my life. I didn't even realize it was me because I have NEVER smelled the way I do after utilizing this product and I don't know what happened.I've never had bad body odor, only issues with sweating too much in specifically my underarms when it's hot. For whatever reason, I have absolutely horrific, foul smelling armpits after an hour of putting this product on. I took a shower, completely washed myself off, and went to bed with nothing on. Little bit of perspiration as usual, but no body odor at all, even without deodorant on period. The next morning, I decided to give this a go again, hoping something had just gone wrong, and tried Stone, which I have in the powder form and love. Nope. Uh-uh. Within an hour, again, my armpits smell absolutely horrific. I smell like I've been working in a mine for the last four weeks and haven't showered in the entire time. I smell like twenty men working on putting out forest fires.So I washed up again, put on what was left of the powder form, and went to bed with no issues. No smell. No sweat. Decided to try the last scent the next day. I was unfortunately in a hurry and didn't remember to add a different brand to my work bag before heading to work. Now we get to cue the most embarrassing shift of my life as I had to be physically active while wearing a deodorant that had already caused me issues (because I was tired and not thinking of consequences, because I'm smart like that), for ten hours. I was in the bathroom every twenty minutes trying to scrub this off of my armpits, pleading to whatever entity would listen that my coworkers wouldn't notice the smell was coming from me. Unfortunately, the only other deodorant I had with me was the Fig scent I had brought with me to work two days previously, before I realized it was a bad idea. So I was having to put it in my bag, to reapply every twenty minutes in addition to wet wipes I was carrying around to wash off with before reapplying.I don't know what happened. I don't know what reaction occurred with specifically the gel version of Harry's, but I definitely don't recommend it. I will be purchasing the powder form and learned my lesson to always look closer before purchasing.",
