But not under my underarms which is great!! The price is great and the fact that I can order it on Amazon and have it delivered is even better... \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

However, it still offers good protection. I just wish it lasted longer.Overall Satisfaction: While I prefer the roll-on version for its longevity, I am still quite happy with the performance of this gel stick. It effectively combats odor and keeps me feeling fresh. It's a dependable choice for daily use.In conclusion, Mitchum Men's Triple Odor Defense Deodorant Gel Stick provides reliable and long-lasting protection. While I have a slight preference for the roll-on version due to its efficiency, this gel stick is still a solid performer.

It goes on easy and dries very quickly. It wont stain clothing or clash with your cologne. It has a faint clean almost medicinal scent but is essentially unscented. This literally is miss-a-day protection. If you're in a rush and forget to put it on on in the morning, you are covered. Others have claimed that, but this is the first one I've used that can back that claim up.",
