I'm committed to using deodorants without antiperspirant, but finding one that smells good, goes on smooth, and lasts has been tricky. I love how this one applies - goes on smooth and doesn't come off in chunks or get gritty. It feels a little moisturizing too which is nice. So far it's been lasting while I'm working, working out, or at school. It's winter, so I'm no getting super hot or sweaty even when I'm working out/going for a run outside. I'm a little annoyed that my cap was broken when I received it because this is a refillable tube and now I kind of want to buy a new one that has an intact lid. That's not the fault of the product though, just a mishap during shipping, so whatever. The price is on par with other \"natural\" deodorants, so while I feel like it's kind of a steep price tag, I also feel like I'm getting a sort of a twofer in that it smells so good it's almost like getting a body spray/perfume and deodorant all in one.",

If you have ever used the bum bum cream, you know how delicious this scent is!I noticed the brand also had a deodorant and purchased it immediately. The deodorant has the exact same scent as a the bum bum cream, which is so nice (and again, if you're a fan of the scent, you will know how awesome it is to be able to use it for your underarms).The scent, while amazing, does wear off pretty quick, so that's the only downside I have seen thus far.I love the roll on feature of the product, and the fact that it's refillable! You can purchase just the refills moving forward, which is great for your piggy bank and also the environment.Fantastic product overall.. I do not smell or sweat at all when wearing this, and am so glad I found it!",

It\u2019s great that it\u2019s natural but it doesn\u2019t last to long. I live in Florida so it\u2019s humid often, along with I sweat a little more than the normal person. Other than that the scent lasts which I do like. I often mix my spray deodorant and this on top just so I can have the smell. I enjoy wearing it since I normally get compliments when I go out. One time I just had this and the body wash and 3 people asked what perfume I was wearing. Again I wish it\u2019s sweat proof abilities lasted longer, but the scent lasts for hours!",

                "reviewText": "Just like every other product from this line, the deodorant smells amazing, and while it does moisturize and treat the skin of my pits, it's not long-lasting, requiring me to reapply it at least once more throughout the day. What's been working for me is to use my old \"nakd\" brand crystal stone deo right after showering, then applying Rio Deo on top; it's an alternative, but it kinda defeats the purpose of the purchase, as I was actually looking for a replacement for the crystal stone (which is kind of a pain in the butt to apply, and it doesn't do much to address any skin concerns).If you're after an ANTIPERSPIRANT, this is NOT the product for you, as it DOES NOT PREVENT SWEATING. What some people don't seem to know is that there is a difference between deodorants (which aim primarily at neutralizing and/or eliminating body odor) and antiperspirants (which actually work on preventing you from sweating, thus avoiding the occurrence of b.o.); while some deodorants might have antiperspirant actives, not all of them are formulated as such - make sure you read your labels to avoid major disappointments and/or wasting your money.While I'm happy with the scent and the moisturizing factors, I'm not sure if I'll be purchasing this product again, as it's not as effective as I expected. If you're after some smelly-goodies and an extra touch of hydration in your pits, it's a nice alternative... Then again, make sure you read the label and know what you're after in your deodorant.",
