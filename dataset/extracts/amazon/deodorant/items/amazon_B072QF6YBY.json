                "reviewText": "I found an old stick of Axe Phoenix deodorant from 2012. It was my signature scent back when I was dating my wife and everyone used to comment on how amazing I smelled all the time.I've been trying to find \"my scent\" by buying a bunch of different high and low end colognes and deodorants, all falling short of impressing my wife. I dabbed some of the dried up 11-year-old stick of Phoenix on my wrist and asked my wife what she thought. Her response, \"Omg! That smells so good! That! Definitely that!\"She was a very disheartened when I told her what it was, knowing we couldn't get it anymore.So, I took to Amazon to find out that the formula had since changed from the version after the one I cherished (the one turned me off of it in the mid 2010s). Hopeful that the product had gone back to its roots, I bought it.I've had it less than 30 minutes. It smelled... not at all like I'd hoped and nothing like rosemary and mint. I put it on wondering what my wife would think.I went and cuddled up to her and she goes, \"Ew, why do you smell like Pine-Sol?\" She's not wrong. Maybe it's not Pine-Sol (because it's been a long time since we've smelled it), but it's definitely similar to how the house smelled when we hired a cleaning company to clean our house and they used really gross-smelling cleaning chemicals. Mr. Clean, maybe?Honestly, it is a disgusting scent. Really, really bad.DEAR UNILEVER,BRING BACK THE EARLY 2010s VERSION OF THE BLUE PHOENIX DEODORANT STICK. IT OUTPERFORMED EVERY OTEHR COLOGNE AND DEODORANT, WOMEN WENT NUTS FOR IT, AND IT WAS BEST SCENT FOR ME. THE NEW FORMULAS ARE DISGUSTING!",
