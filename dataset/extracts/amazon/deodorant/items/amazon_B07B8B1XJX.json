Recently I began to use the Sensitive Almay deodorant and caused irritation in my skin. Until then I began to do research and found that some of the ingredients increase odor rather then block it off. After searching online, I can across with this deodorant and the performance of this deodorant is mind blowing. It so smooth, no stains, no dryness, it glides ever so smoothly and the coconut smell is long lasting.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT, beyond obsessed with this deodorant its definitely worth the investment",

                "reviewText": "I was in the beginning stages of stomach flu/norovirus/food poisoning, waking up in the morning feeling like I overate, but I was doing ok until I took a whiff of the Beach scent that instigated me to immediately vomit; it was that pungent. But let's start with the good first. My first exposure to Kopari deodorant was with their Original scent which I highly recommend to start with. It smells so good and I love the way the applicator is designed round so that it applies evenly to the skin. If you overapply it does leave residual but that will quickly melt into your skin and will not stain your clothes. The downside is that you can't finish every bit of the deodorant at the end because of the bottom design which causes waste. Because I love the Original scent, I decided to try other new scents and bought the Tropical scent and Beach scent (on sale). Tropical scent smells like candy, very sweet that you would seriously think it would attract ants. The Beach scent though, I cannot describe what it smells like but it definitely does not smell like ocean or beach water like I would imagine it would. It smells very pungent. I bought the Beach scent from Amazon about seven months ago and when I first unwrapped it the top of the round applicator was dried up which indicates old shelf life which is strange since it hasn't been a year since I bought it. Examining the picture more I think I got sent old stock or expired stock, if only there was a way to check when a product was manufactured. Great brand, just be careful with the Beach scent. I guess there's no way to be careful with receiving old stock.",

                "reviewText": "For reference, I live in the hot, humid deep South. I also work on my feet in a fast-paced environment in usually warm, humid indoor conditions and attend in-person college. I don't like to carry extra things with me when I'm at school and work from 8am-8pm, and that includes deodorant, so it must last me 12+ hours AT THE MINIMUM. I was looking for a replacement to my usual brand of deodorant (Ethique) for honestly only a couple small reasons:1. Ethique deodorant works AMAZINGLY, but it comes in a cardboard tube that doesn't function smoothly (which is an upgrade from when it had no applicator).2. The application of the product can be a bit dry at first, which isn't painful but does cause it to start crumbling when nearing the end of the tube.However, Kopari didn't live up to expectations and has honestly made me wonder why I'm even searching for a better deodorant when I've already found a nearly perfect one. For comparison:Application- Kopari applies SUPER smoothly, almost like a wet mineral-type deodorant, lol. I find I have to really rub it on, so it tends to stay slightly 'wet' for a minute, but soaks in eventually.- Ethique needs to 'warm up' to your skin before it starts to apply more smoothly. It definitely isn't the smoothest, but not too bad. It's almost like trying to deodorize with a bar of soap before it starts to glide.Scent- Kopari (charcoal scent) smells decent, at first. After a short while (maybe a few hours of wear), I find that it starts to smell strongly like I'm wearing old deodorant (like when I'd use regular non-natural types). Kinda makes me feel gross and I worry that others can smell it if I'm too close. I can also smell the awful scent on the armpit of my clothes.- Ethique has great scents that are quite mild. Unscented (I haven't tested), one more feminine (Lavender&Vanilla) and a Eucalyptus one that is good for anyone. However, both scented ones mostly fade throughout the day and you are left... scentless! Like, I don't smell bad at all, and I'm saying that as someone with STRONG armpit odor.Longevity- Kopari barely lasts a few hours, even if I'm just sitting around. It'll be a mix of that 'old deodorant' smell mixed with my own BO coming through. By night-time, my BO isn't full-force, but it's definitely there with barely any hint of the deodorant's scent. Even when I've tried to reapply when my BO comes back, it doesn't seem to effectively reapply. Very disappointing waste of $24 (I bought a 2-pack because I had high hopes based on the reviews).- Ethique seriously lasts. As I said previously, the scent fades to nothingness, but I don't start to smell myself in exchange. I can apply it at 7am Day 1, and feel confident enough to go another full day without reapplying it on Day 2 (I know, I can be a gross little gremlin but sometimes I plop my butt into bed after a full day and gotta do it all again the next day with no time to shower lol). Sometimes I will do a quick reapplication, but I NEVER smell as bad as I do when using Kopari.Last Remarks- Both Kopari and Ethique keep clothing mark-free. Kopari glides on clear, and Ethique may leave a hint of the deodorant's color on your skin during application, which quickly fades. I wonder if the thicker consistency of Ethique is what helps its longevity.- Neither of them irritate my skin, unlike a popular baking-soda based one I've tried in the past despite me not really having sensitive skin.- Both are similar prices. One tube/bar of Ethique can last me 4-6 months. I bought my last tube early October 2022, and just needed to reorder late March 2023. I apply it liberally. I've only owned Kopari for a week or two, but I feel there's no way it could last as long if I have to reapply it as often as it needs.Even after a day (or two) spent sweating, Ethique has reliably held up for multiple years, but Kopari performs worse than my regular Dove deodorant that I only keep around for times when I put off reordering for too long, lol. I planned to just go through the 2-pack that I ordered because that's $24 I would waste otherwise, but constantly smelling like either my strong BO or nasty old deodorant is both embarrassing and just a hassle to deal with. If you barely have any BO, I would go with a different scent than the Charcoal one, maybe?",
