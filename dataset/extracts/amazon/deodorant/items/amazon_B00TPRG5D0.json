However I'm sticking with it for now. It has a good scent, fresh and clean smelling. It keeps my armpits dry. I love that it lasts 48 hours. And I love that it's in bulk because I know that I won't be needing to buy more deodorant for a while.",

It manages my sweat and maintains a fresh scent throughout the day. 48-hours is an overly bold claim, I think, but this has easily lasted me a full day without needing to re-apply.The scent is pleasant, albeit a generic 'fresh' one. While I think Old Spice has it beat in the range and strength in the scent department, Degree flat out destroys it when it comes to longevity and effectiveness. The value for money with Degree is also a huge win.I can't see myself going back to another brand now. Congratulations, Degree, you've won me over!",

Winning all around.Left a star off because they use a lot of chemicals to accomplish this. Would be a real winner if it could do all this and was also aluminum free or talc free.",
