The clinical strength formulas are worth every penny in savings from extra washings, stain removers, to not having to discard stained tops or excessive dry cleaning bills. Keeps me dry even under stressful situations. Couldn\u2019t say that before I began using clinical strength formulas after a pharma rep friend said how well they worked about 16 years ago. Saved me so much over the years! Unbelievably great- all of the clinical strength versions.",

                "reviewText": "Oh, Secret Clinical Strength Antiperspirant and Deodorant, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways... or better yet, let me share my hilarious tale of how you transformed me into the ultimate odor-fighting superhero!Picture this: It was a scorching summer day, and I had a hot date planned with my crush. I wanted to make a great impression, so I put on my best outfit, styled my hair, and even practiced my smoothest pick-up lines in the mirror. But there was one thing I couldn't control: the dreaded underarm sweat monster!Luckily, Secret Clinical Strength swooped in like a caped crusader, ready to conquer my perspiration woes. With one swipe, it unleashed its magical powers, and suddenly, I felt like I had an invisible forcefield protecting me from embarrassing sweat stains.As I walked towards my date, I couldn't help but feel like a secret agent on a mission to save the world from underarm disasters. With each step, I was confident that my armpits were staying as dry as a desert, and my confidence soared higher than a superhero leaping over tall buildings.Throughout the date, I laughed, I danced, and I even did the Macarena (don't judge me, it was a moment of pure joy).

The price seems high but a bottle lasts me at least 6 months, so you\u2019re talking about a few pounds a month which is pretty standard. It rolls on dry - no waving your arms in the air these days and it WORKS so well, even on holiday and really hot weather. I need it forever and ever!!",
