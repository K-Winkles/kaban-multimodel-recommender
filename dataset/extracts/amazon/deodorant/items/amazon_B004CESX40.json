                "reviewText": "I have been using Mitchum deodorant since sometime in the 1970's. It is hands down the absolute best antiperspirant/deodorant. Particularly great for camping, when daily showers are not always available - you will smell the rest of yourself before you smell your underarms lol. 3 days of protection if you're not in terribly hot weather or swimming. I use the roll-on, this solid is my son's preference. The only negative I have is that the 'unscented', which for many years really was unscented, has been altered to .. a lightly scented 'unscented'. Solid, roll-on - it doesn't seem to matter which - unscented is no longer actually unscented. However, this is the best, most reliable deodorant out there. You never see commercials for Mitchum because, they don't need to advertise. Loyal customers and word of mouth is all they need. Yes, it's that good. Do yourself a favor and try it.",

                "reviewText": "Mitchum Men's Deodorant, the Antiperspirant Stick with Triple Odor Defense, is my go-to choice for reliable protection against body odor. While I'm not particularly fond of the smell, the results it delivers make it a small compromise I'm willing to make.The 48-hour protection this deodorant offers is truly impressive. It keeps me feeling fresh and confident throughout the day, even during more strenuous activities. The invisible solid formula is a plus, leaving no white marks on clothing.Although the scent isn't my personal favorite, it's a minor trade-off considering the effectiveness of this antiperspirant. The peace of mind that comes with knowing I'm odor-free is invaluable, and I appreciate how well this product delivers on its promises.For anyone seeking a deodorant that works hard to keep body odor at bay, Mitchum Men's Antiperspirant Stick is an excellent choice. The scent might not be my top preference, but the benefits far outweigh this small drawback. It's a five-star product that I trust to keep me fresh and odor-free day after day!",

                "reviewText": "Its fully effective in preventing sweat and odor, especially coming from some cheap stuff prior. I only use a small amount, maybe one full swipe, and i'm good for the day.My gripe and the reason I won't purchase again though is the strong smell of manliness it puts out. I use it sparingly so I never smell it during the day when dressed, or have become nose blind to it, but I can't get it to fully wash off in the evenings. When lathering up, the deodorant feels like a massive dry spot in the shower that doesn't wash off, so I smell it all night since I mostly walk around shirtless. The smell is pervasive and musty, making me feel as if I'm overcompensating, like I need to go buy an F250 and jump on a skiploader.It works, well, and good for you if the scent works, but I'd love an unscented versionUpdate: I either became nose blind or the smell has subsided, so I'm thinking there's some inconsistency in manufacturing. Too much scent when I first got it and very low scent after the 1st mm of product was used. 4 stars if this plays out",

I'm a big guy, so weak deodorant does not work. This has lasted for 48 hours on occasions I was not able to wake up and take a shower. I used the white degree for a while, which is good, but Mitchum is certainly the best for me.",
