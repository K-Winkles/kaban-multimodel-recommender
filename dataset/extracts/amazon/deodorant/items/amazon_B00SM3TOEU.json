                "reviewText": "I decided to try this deodorant out on a whim, looking for something different that I might prefer over the usual drugstore options out there. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this one worked! The effects last well over 24 hours for me, and I don\u2019t find myself having to reapply before my next shower. The scent itself is pleasant, not overpowering at all. The application is extremely smooth. It feels almost like a gel when it goes on, and it doesn\u2019t drag or tug at the skin when you\u2019re putting it on. On top of that, I haven\u2019t noticed any residue on my clothes after using it! This has been the best deodorant I\u2019ve ever used, and I\u2019ll probably continue using it forever unless it gets discontinued.",

So doing a comparison between them, Ban doesn\u2019t quite measure up. It is on the drier side applying it at first, after about a week it started going on smoother. For normal daily wear it does the job, but doesn\u2019t hold up as well when you get really active.My biggest complaint is the sticky feel it gives me by the end of the day. It\u2019s still working to control odor but definitely giving out in the antiperspirant department! It says 24 hour protection but definitely not in dryness!",
