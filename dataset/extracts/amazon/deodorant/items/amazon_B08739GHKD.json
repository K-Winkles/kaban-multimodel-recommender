                "reviewText": "I moved from a different Al-free deodorant to this one about four weeks ago. The previous one I used did not contain magnesium, smelled good, but on high-activity / sweaty days I was finding I needed to reapply mid-afternoon. This is not the case with MAGSOL. In fact, I have even missed an application and had it continue to work perfectly for (at least) 48 hours.This is important: it did not seem to work perfectly at first. The first few days that I used MAGSOL, it would seem to wear off mid-afternoon just like my previous Al-free deo. But about a week in, I realized I had stopped reapplying it, even after a workout. I was sweating, but even the underlying pit smell seemed completely gone, not just covered up.The catch is: I am a man with unshaven pits and this one does not glide as well as some others, but after some experimentation this is what I worked out (thought I should pass this on):- It might not kill all smell on the first day (it didn't for me). Be patient, it seems to take a few days of applications before the magnesium kills off the bacteria enough to fully eliminate scent.- The ingredients melt a little with body heat. So apply it slowly and it will glide better.- If you have unshaven pits, use a bunch of small applications instead of trying to slather your pits in one large stroke. If you try to do it all at once, it will take hair with it, but smaller motions work a lot better.- When applying after a shower, first towel off really well. It does not apply well to wet skin.- You can use less than you think you need. After the first week or so, it seems to be a bit absorbed in your skin so you still need to apply it but not in a thick layer. A very thin layer is fine.One point on the scent: I have the sandalwood version and it's not as \"manly\" as other sandalwood sticks I have tried, but I find it relatively mild and pleasant. Given how effectively it prevents BO, I'm fine with it being a somewhat neutral scent.",

This sandalwood deodorant works and stays with me all day without causing irritation. The down side is the experience and it has gone up almost 25% from my first purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I am so happy that I have found this brand. I have been using the jasmine one for a while now, and it has been amazing! My underarms are so incredibly sensitive that alcohol, aluminum, baking soda, etc. all irritate my skin. This paired with glycolic acid keeps my odor at bay. Not to mention, this single deodorant has lasted me about 4 months (sometimes I use it a couple of times per day). I think it is totally worth the money (look into purchasing it on the MAGSOL website, it can be cheaper). The ONLY negative thing I have to say about this deodorant is that the beeswax can be difficult to wash off in the shower.",

                "reviewText": "I really really really wanted this to work for me. I loved the scent, I loved the ingredient list. It just wasn't compatible with my sensitive armpit skin. There's nothing on the ingredient list that I am normally reactive to, but for unknown reasons, this formula would make my armpits break out in a red bumpy rash. I've been using it since May, so for almost half a year now, and I've determined that it's definitely the deodorant causing this rash and not other products or razor burn. The other thing I had trouble with was that it's a very \"stiff\" formula. I had to really press it on to get it to apply to my skin and the act of rubbing it so hard might have also exacerbated the skin sensitivity issue. It was easiest to apply when I got right out of the shower and my skin was still dewy.All that aside, this looks to be a long-lasting, well made, and high quality formula. It worked really well at keeping my armpits fresh and the bad odor away. So if you don't have sensitive skin, I would recommend this deodorant. If you skin is selective about what goes on it, I would recommend to first try the unscented formula in hopes that it would work more compatibly with your skin and proceed with caution.",

Water, soap, everything I tried and it was just sticking and clumping to each individual hair. It was also turning my skin a yellowish orange color. Everything seems to be fine now, but needless to say I won't be using it again.",
