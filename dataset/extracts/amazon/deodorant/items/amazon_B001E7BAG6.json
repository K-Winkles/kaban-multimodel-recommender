                "reviewText": "Received my order today. It was much quicker than expected. Took 9 days to arrive.It's quite large compared to your usual deodorant which is good because it will probably last for a long time. When you twist thebottom be careful as a lot might come out. When I first applied it, it was sticky. Soon it driedout and left my armpits dry and powdery white. No sweat!!! :) Also it has a pleasent smell to it (a bit like mitchum powder fresh). I have been searching for a long time for the perfect deodorant (i'm 24 now). This may be the one. Will test it by going for a run and see how it holds up and I will update it.",
