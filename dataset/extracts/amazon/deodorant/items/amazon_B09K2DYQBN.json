Schmidt\u2019s Charcoal and Magnesium is the first Ecocert Certified Natural Deodorant in the US \u2014 Formulated with certified 100 percent natural origin ingredients, this natural deodorant for women and men is made without aluminum, and is certified vegan by Vegan Action and Leaping Bunny certified cruelty-free. Our natural deodorant formula helps neutralize odor and keep you fresh, enriched with magnesium, and offers all-day 24 hour odor protection while being gentle on skin. Schmidt\u2019s is made with plant-based oils and butters like coconut oil, jojoba seed oil, and shea moisture butter, as well as vitamin E. Luxurious, long-lasting scents made with 100 percent natural origin fragrance are never synthetic, always made with plant isolates and essential oils like tea tree oil, jasmine oil, and lavender oil. All of our Schmidt\u2019s natural deodorant sticks require only a small amount of application for great results. To use, hold the product momentarily to skin to soften on contact with body heat. Gently apply a small amount to dry, clean underarms to keep you feeling fresh all day. 1-2 swipes for application are all you need. The non-greasy and non-sticky feel allows the deodorant to be easily absorbed. Do not apply to irritated, damaged or freshly shaved skin.",

                "reviewText": "Been using Schmidt's deodorant since the beginning of the Covid fiasco when my old trusted brand became unavailable.I prefer the Lime over the others I have tried/smelled as it is unique but not overpowering. One application easily works for 24 hrs (12 hrs if working/sweating hard)... I really like the travel sized ones for convenience without paying a premium (same price per once as full size ones when I hast ordered) .The only negative thing I can say is that due the formula being very soft and white, it does show on clothing and I have yet to find an easy way to remove it... I have just adjusted my routine to put pullover shirts on before applying... sounds simple but having done it differently for 50years I still slip up and end up having to hamper a fresh shirt if I forget and mess it up...",

Firstly the juniper/pine odor is rather strong. Not bad just kind of overpowering. Also, the texture is less like a wax or gel (what I\u2019ve experienced usually with roll-on deodorants) and more a putty/clay. It goes on very thick resulting in using up a container pretty quickly. I\u2019ve attempted to apply it more sparingly - this stuff either doesn\u2019t dispense at all, or blobs onto skin thickly.After this two pack I\u2019ll be moving on to another brand, with a more subtle fragrance.",

I'm not sure how it would fair with someone who is a heavy sweater. In the past I've had some and it kind of crumbled when I put it on, but that was a one-time thing, maybe a bad stick..Anyway, two thumbs up for me.",

Die waren auch alle in Ordnung, haben geholfen (kein Schwei\u00dfgeruch). Aber irgendwie hatte ich immer den ganzen Tag so ein leicht schmieriges Gef\u00fchl unter den Armen.Ich mag am liebsten die geruchlosen Varianten.Und dann bin ich auf diesen Deostick gesto\u00dfen. Die Anwendung als Stick ist nat\u00fcrlich wesentlich praktischer als als Deocreme (man muss nicht die oft ziemlich feste \"Creme\" aus dem Tiegel kratzen bzw. mit W\u00e4rme \"\u00fcberreden\", sondern kann es direkt auftragen). Ja, die Verpackung ist aus Plastik.Aber die Wirkung!!! Einfach wow! Wie gesagt geruchlos. Von der Konsistenz eher nicht so cremig, sondern fester. L\u00e4sst sich dennoch gut verteilen nach warmem Hautkontakt. Und h\u00e4lt wirklich den ganzen Tag! Egal, wie hei\u00df es ist, wie sehr man schwitzt. Man riecht nicht! Und, jetzt kommt der Unterschied zu den vorgenannten ausprobierten Deos: Kein schmieriges Gef\u00fchl. Man merkt nichts mehr, zieht einfach ein und gut is's.Bin megabegeistert!Nur der Preis ist heftig.Und eine umweltfreundlichere Verpackung w\u00e4re auch w\u00fcnschenswert.Trotzdem klare Kaufempfehlung!",
