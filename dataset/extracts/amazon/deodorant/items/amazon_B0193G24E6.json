I have had on my tank tops, like undershirt/camisoles where it will run off some onto the edge of the camisole but it washes out good without staining. I love this deodorant and this is a great price deal. Received in great condition!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been avoiding aluminum deodorant for years bc the media convinced me that I\u2019d get cancer bc of them. I\u2019ve tried so many natural brands (all overpriced just like Lume). All the testimonies about Lume made me believe it was the Holy Grail so I finally bought it. First, the smell is unpleasant. It doesn\u2019t smell like roses it smells like weird fishy/chemical medicine. Decided to try it anyways. Maybe that\u2019s part of the magic?? I put it on and rush to the bathroom once I get home after just a 7 hour work day (my job is not labor intensive). I smell my armpits\u2026 and they smell musty.It was at that moment I decided that I needed to do some research about how \u201charmful\u201d these aluminum deodorants really are bc I wanted to start trying them. I couldn\u2019t find any information that scientifically suggested that aluminum deodorant would give you cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201cIf you're worried about your body absorbing aluminum through your underarms, you can take comfort in knowing that it's highly unlikely your body is absorbing any significant degree of aluminum through the skin, especially if you only use antiperspirant in a small area and on unbroken skin, according to Dr. Zeichner. In fact, one study found that only 0.012 percent of the aluminum in deodorant is absorbed through underarms \u2014 which is significantly less than you would absorb from eating aluminum-rich food (think fish, vegetables and roots).\u201dLol. So I tried Suave powder fresh antiperspirant ($2.80). And my armpits smelled like baby powder for about 20 hours. \ud83d\ude02 so now I\u2019m on my antiperspirant journey.Also, out of all the natural brands I\u2019ve tried, Schmidt\u2019s is the best, its longevity is about 15 hours, Native is the 2nd best but its longevity is more like 7 hours. So now I wear antiperspirant (Suave) or Schmidt (natural) during the day. I wear Native or Dr. Teals deodorant at night (they last the whole night since I\u2019m not moving around a lot).If I were you I\u2019d buy Schmidt rose vanilla deodorant and Suave powder deodorant and alternate between the two.Dove sucks and so does degree. Even their aluminum deodorant doesn\u2019t have the same longevity as suave, I literally smelled my B.o creeping through those deodorants during the middle of the day. And suave is more affordable so it\u2019s a win win.The Thai spray deodorant is also worth a try, it\u2019s pretty good especially if you don\u2019t have strong odor but it\u2019s unscented so I don\u2019t love it.",
