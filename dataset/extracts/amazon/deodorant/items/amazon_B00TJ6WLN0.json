A two-pack of Mitchum is almost the same price as for one Secret. It also comes in a roll-on option which works great! I will continue to buy this so long as it works for me. \ud83d\udc4d",

It dries somewhat slowly after applying it and can leave stains on the clothes you wear, so I recommend waiting a few minutes before putting on the clothes you chose, it doesn't make you sweat and is long lasting. I read some reviews where they found that the content comes out, well it worked for me once applied, I turn the wheel backwards, in the opposite direction and all the content returns and prevents it from spilling",

                "reviewText": "Most deodorants did NOT work for me. Ive tried going natural, no aluminum, no whatever. I've tried almost everything, but not going to lie nothing really managed to keep me from smelling funky after a few hours or after I stepped outside in this Florida heat. I'm a sweaty girl! The only deodorant that truly helped me stay smelling good and dry was the Secret Derma+ Antiperspirant but that one was so expensive and not worth the price for the amount it gave me. I decided to try Mitchum and I don't think I'm switching any time soon! It's great, smells great, lasts all day, os a clear gel which i LOVE, and is a full sized deodorant! My only complaint is that when I close the lid, the product (the gel) comes out a bit and makes a mess. But I dont really care about that. Great antiperspirant!",
