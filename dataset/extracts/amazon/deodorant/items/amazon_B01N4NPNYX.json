                "reviewText": "I was very skeptical about using this product but my doctor actually talked me into trying it. I've been having issues with underarm itch from my last deodorant and switching to Dove deodorant was suggested as it is supposed to be useful for sensitive skin. I was skeptical because I work out a lot and figured this deodorant wouldn't be up to the test but I was WRONG! This works great to control wetness and odor. The scent could be toned down a little for my tastes but it isn't overpowering. I haven't had any issues with white marks on dark clothing but I haven't really paid attention to it. I do LOVE the fact that it glides on smooth and it doesn't leave those bunched up white balls of deodorant under your arms like some of the other solids.Overall this is a great product and worth the price! For every woman wondering if it is worth the money - it is! I used to use Secret deodorant until they changed the formula or something and it quit working for me. So after trying several other deodorants, I went to Sure. But now it makes my skin itch - might be hormonal changes, not necessarily the deodorant's fault.This is now my new deodorant. Great stuff and worth trying!",

                "reviewText": "Dove Advanced Care Antiperspirant is definitely awesome. In the hot summer months here in NC, I need something that offers both superior wetness AND odor control. Some deodorant products leave my underarms itchy and irritated, especially when I sweat. Others smell great when applied but after a long workout or several hours working in the yard, that scent quickly wears off, leaving me smelling less than fresh. :)I love the creamy texture of this product. It glides across my skin easily and leaves my underarms feeling moisturized and protected without feeling coated, sticky, or slimy.The fragrance is a little more subtle than I would have preferred but it still smells very fresh & clean, maybe even a little powdery. (not a fan of powdery scents normally) I would have preferred the scent to be a little stronger but that is just my personal preference.I shower daily so I can't say for sure that the protection lasts 48 hours. However, I can say that it lasts the entire day until I DO shower. My underarms are never sticky, wet, or smelly AND the product doesn't rub off on my clothes leaving those dreaded white marks!Through the Chatterbox by House Party program, I received a free Dove Advanced Care Antiperspirant to try and give my opinions on. All opinions expressed here are my own and not influenced by the company in any way.",

                "reviewText": "My usual deodorant stopped working a couple years ago. I won't name names, but it starts with a D and ends with -egree. :P I tried a bunch of \"clinical-strength\" and natural deodorants/antiperspirants, but none worked, except Native, but it also made my underarms burn and itch from dry-ness, so that wasn't cool either. Then I tried this one, and BINGO! I've been using it ever since and it's worked perfectly, even when I'm sweating my butt off outside in a tank-top for hours. The coconut scent is my favorite, but I think I've tried them all, and I haven't found one I didn't like. I've heard rave reviews from friends about this deodorant too, so I don't think it's just me. If you're on the fence, try it!!",
