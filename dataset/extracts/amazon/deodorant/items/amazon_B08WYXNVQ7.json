I have very sensitive skin and none of these break me out. But most importantly - they work ridiculously well. I put it on in the morning and at bedtime I have zero odor even after a hot day outside at the beach or hiking. I can\u2019t comment on if it helps with sweating or not as I\u2019m not a big underarm sweater so I can\u2019t say if it makes a difference in that department, but it does completely eliminate any body smell. I have not had any b.o. at all since I began using this. I ask my husband and my friends and they confirm. I\u2019ve never had a natural deodorant work very well so this stuff blew my mind. Plus there\u2019s the added bonus of people asking me what I\u2019m wearing that smells so good and I get to tell them that it\u2019s my armpits. :-) Try it. Yes, it\u2019s expensive but it\u2019s worth every penny.",

It goes on much smoother than I had expected for a natural deodorant. Also, the scent is more subtle that I thought it would be, but that's not a bad thing. My husband had to get pretty close in order to smell it after i applied it. Overall I love this product, and it seems to work well for me.",

                "reviewText": "I finally caved after seeing this all over my TikTok FYP. It smells SO good. I got the Santal & Vetiver scent. Salt & Stone's packaging is really beautiful too...I love the neutral/clay colors. I have worn this for a couple of days already and have no complaints... the smell is lovely but not overwhelming - I get subtle whiffs of it when I'm moving about my day. I can't say much about the antiperspirant properties just yet as I haven't put it through the test of a workout, but I will update my review once I do. My only tiny complaint would be that it goes on very wet, so be careful when applying so that it doesn't get all over the place.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m always highly skeptical of natural deodorants and have not had good experiences with other brands in the past. I\u2019ve used this product 2 days in a row and so far I\u2019m impressed. After a 12 hour workday I made my husband do a smell test and he goes \u201cweird it smells really good still\u201d. Absolutely no body odor came through this heavenly scent. I am typically sensitive to baking soda so I half expected to get a rash from this product but so far I have not! Overall the product goes on relatively smoothly, likely because of the coconut oil and shea butter ingredients. If you are looking to try a new natural deodorant I would definitely give this a shot. I also purchased the gel version and will be reviewing that in the coming days.",

                "reviewText": "I have wanted to try this deodorant for a long time and now that I have I\u2019m not quite sure what all the hype is about. It does indeed smell good and I knew it was not an antiperspirant but it does not do its job of keeping away BO. A few hours after I apply it that familiar smell starts coming back. I am not interested in a product I need to apply multiple times a day. I will not be repurchasing this product which is a shame because I wanted it to work so badly.",

                "reviewText": "I bought both santal & vetiver, and neroli & basil. The santal scent was god awful on both me and my boyfriend, but the neroli & basil was actually delicious. Unfortunately the deodorant isn't very powerful--it barely got either of us through a day of work and it would never last through an actual workout or hot summer afternoon. And it made my pits break out in what looked and felt like razor burn, which I never ever get on my pits otherwise, and which went away as soon as I stopped using it.",

Does not cause any skin or irritation issues.1 thing to keep in mind is that it will leave marks on dark clothes. Otherwise, great product",
