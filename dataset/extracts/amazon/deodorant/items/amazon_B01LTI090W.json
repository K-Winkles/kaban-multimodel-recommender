By slowing down the flow of sweat to the surface of the skin, they help control wetness and, in turn, odor. On the other hand, deodorants only help reduce odor. Deodorants help control odor by masking the underarm stank caused by the bacteria interacting with sweat and also by reducing odor-causing bacteria. It\u2019s actually these bacteria, not the wetness, believe it or not, which cause the odor. How do I avoid smelling bad or control body odor? There are a few steps to take to avoid smelling of body odor. First, take a shower and clean your whole body thoroughly with a scented body wash or soap to get rid of lingering sweat or stench. When you\u2019re done with that, apply an antiperspirant or deodorant to your underarms. This will protect you from any odors that may try to surface throughout the day. For additional good smells, try using a body spray or cologne spray. Don\u2019t use too much of a spray because too much can be overwhelming. How do I fight excessive sweating? First, make sure you\u2019re wearing an antiperspirant, not a deodorant. When it comes to controlling sweat, antiperspirants are more fit for the job than deodorants. Antiperspirants plug up your sweat ducts and get rid of sweat. Sweat stimulates odor-causing bacteria, and when you get rid of sweat, you get rid of stink. For our best Old Spice sweat protection, try a product from the Hardest Working Collection. What causes body odor? Sweat on its own is odorless and evaporates pretty quickly. In areas like under your arms, sweat can\u2019t easily evaporate, causing the feeling of wetness. With sweat comes odor. Bacteria breaks down sweat and creates underarm odor; bacteria thrive in warm, moist surroundings.",
