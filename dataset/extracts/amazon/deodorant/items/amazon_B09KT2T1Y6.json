The scent is really nice, it does not leave me sweating, it contains natural ingredients safe for use (no aluminum), it lasts all day and the price is literally perfect. I'm a very sensitive person in general and usually when I use the regular brands from retail stores such as old spice or any other product, I gag out and have a crazy allergic reaction to any deodorant / cologne I use. However, this product does not cause any of that to me. I almost never care to write review but I had to come back to write this review to let ya'll know that this is the deodorant that you should be putting on your body compared to other brands that contain chemicals and are potentially harmful for you. 10/10 highly recommend!!",

After searching high and low, I realized that manscaped has DO for the BO. Its smooth, smells kinda like aqua di gio (but a little more mushy which I love) and is affordable. I'm now secure in my deodorant choice and my shirts can rest easy because they won't get ruined.",

The deodorant however is not the same quality. It hurt going on, it lasted maybe a couple of hours and I have a office job. So now it sits on a shelf. It was a waste of money and will no doubt end up in the trash barely used. Still great beard products, but not so much for the deodorant",
