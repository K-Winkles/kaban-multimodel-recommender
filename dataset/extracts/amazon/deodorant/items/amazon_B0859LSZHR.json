I wish they would bring back the original color scheme of dark brown and taupe cause the off white design just looks like so many other products on the market IMO.

                "reviewText": "This is a great deodorant but there are a few caveats that one should know before purchasing. First, this product leans more towards a deodorant than an anti-perspirant. It works OK as an anti-perspirant but if you are a very heavy sweater, one application will not be enough for a full day. Second, this does not mask body odor. This is not a product to use if you had to skip a shower and needed something to get you through the day. Tossing this on already desperate pits will just make your BO smell flowery. Third, I had some staining on shirts when I first switched but that has disappeared. I do not know if the initial stains were due to me adapting to a new deodorant or if they changed the formula.If those three things are non issues for you, this is a wonderful deo with a smell that is good but remains neutral. It can be overpowering if you apply too much but that's normal. It also does a great job with thick hair and doesn't just tack on top of it.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:Has a ginger and slight oatmeal smell that is very light and would be perfect for people that prefer a light or unscented deodorant.Goes on very smoothCons:This is way too expensive for how little how have versus how fast it goes.The directions say to place a thin layer on but if you prefer to smell your scents on yourself, you'll need to use a little more, which in turn makes it run out faster. And trust me you will want to use more because it leads into my final con:Very ineffective. You can either follow the directions and place a thin layer or you can do you and put on however much you want, it doesn't matter. This stuff barely lasts an hour before you don't even smell like anything under your arms and not too long after that you'll start to even smell bad. Which is laughable considering it says right on the bottle it lasts 48 hours. Even if you dumped the whole roll on would it not last longer than 3 hours tops.Waste of money.",

To my surprise, I like the smell and product so much that I\u2019ll probably purchase it again even though it\u2019s pricy. It is not unscented, but the smell is very nice and subtle.",
