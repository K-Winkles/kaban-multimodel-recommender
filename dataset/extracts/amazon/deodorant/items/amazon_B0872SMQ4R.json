Smells amazing but you will definitely have residue on your armpit because it goes on very thick and white. Can get clumpy! Also comes in a cardboard package which is environmentally great but becomes difficult to put the lid back on. Also hard to use without putting fingers inside to keep it to the surface as it\u2019s built like a push pop and with light application will go back in the tube.Though the cons are annoying, product itself is amazing. I eventually plan to buy several, empty them into a new container and use something else for application like a face tool.",

The scent is great too!Update: So this worked great the first week and now it's hardly working at all. The cardboard tube is annoying, the lid is small and there's a lot of wasted deodorant from it scraping off as I'm putting the lid on. I have to wash every eight hours or so because it just stopped working entirely, like every other natural deodorant I've tried. From what I understand it takes the body a little over a month to get used to not having aluminum on the skin, so I'll just have to continue constantly washing and see if it starts working better eventually. Really frustrating process and I don't recommend trying this for the first time in the middle of summer. I'm in air conditioning all day and it's still problematic.Second update: OK, so after a month things have normalized and it's working about as well as any other deodorant. Thank goodness. I will repurchase this again and continue to use it.Third update: Had to discontinue use. Caused a weird very dark line on my armpit that won't go away.",

But, it leaves white deodorant marks on your pits, so watch out. The tube itself is made of cardboard, which is great. But, there is no dial to keep the stick up while applying. So it's a little bit of a pain to apply. Finally, it did not last long because the stick is not completely solid so it crumbles a bit when you use it.",

                "reviewText": "For me, I like it because it keeps me from smelling. However it is different from regular deodorant in that the packaging requires you to push the stick up through the tube, and since it's cardboard you need to hold it there to keep it from sliding back down when you apply. Also, because it softens with body heat when you apply, when you put the lid back on it will squish the overflow down creating flaky bits which fall out of the tube. Also, because it's sort of a paste stick you're applying, you need to dab and pat and smooth this on your skin. It may leave white on your clothes. If these are things that would irritate you, then this is not the deodorant for you. If you're okay with these things, then I would recommend it. I like how the formula (1) keeps the stink away, and (2) after smoothed onto the skin dries in a thin layer with a matte finish. Compared to other natural deodorants that actually work, this is a pretty decent price at $8.",

It does leave a white residue on dark clothes (so far, only if I put my deodorant on before putting on my shirt) and the packaging is rather annoying. I like the premise of the packaging, but the deodorant doesn\u2019t stay up and I have to perform a juggling act to push up the tube, while putting on deodorant. I do think that the company should address this issue.Update: I've been using for several months now and this is the best deodorant. The other day, I showered on a Friday and went to winter camp (cottage). It was freezing, so I didn\u2019t really want to remove any clothes to clean up. Come Monday morning, I was back home and thankful to shower. I never reapplied my deodorant all weekend, but still smelled great. I was utterly shocked.",
