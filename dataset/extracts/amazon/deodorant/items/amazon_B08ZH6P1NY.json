The long-lasting protection it provides is unbeatable.I particularly appreciate the fresh, masculine scent. It's not overpowering, and it leaves a subtle, clean aroma that keeps me feeling refreshed. Plus, the scent isn't too strong, so it won't clash with any cologne or body spray I choose to wear.The application is smooth . The deodorant glides on effortlessly without leaving any sticky residue. It dries quickly, so there's no waiting around before getting dressed. The solid stick design is convenient and mess-free, making it perfect for travel or daily use.The value for money is outstanding. It's an affordable option that doesn't compromise on quality. With its long-lasting protection and effective odor control, a single stick lasts a considerable amount of time.",

Davon habe ich wirklich nach und nach einige wegwerfen m\u00fcssen, da der Wirkstoffl\u00e4ngerfristig regelrecht aush\u00e4rtete (w\u00e4hrend des MVD's !!!!). Unter dem Arm schmierte und klebte die Masse ... ekelhaft. Umso begeisterter bin ich nun von diesem angenehmen Deo-Wirkstoff, an dem es meiner Meinung nach nichts zu bem\u00e4ngeln gibt.
