I, a woman, wear it regularly for its superior odor and perspiration control. Why on earth you cannot purchase the original scent in stores anymore is beyond me\u2026.. we have repeated this purchase multiple times and will continue to do so!",

Its anti-perspirant is reasonably strong, but not bullet-proof.I do wish this class of product was easier to find. My local drugstores seem to stock plenty of deodorants and even a few anti-perspirants, but no products that offered both; not that I could find.",
