                "reviewText": "This deo has an ideal thickness to be used as a deodorant. It isn't too soft an it isn't hardMy skin didn't give any reactions to it. It doesn't give any feeling after I apply it. Nothing slippery or dry. It is like it isn't there.It does the job to get rid of the bad smell all day. I didn't take the risk of not applying it the second day.It lasts for a long time. It doesn't spread all over its container and bother me. The mechanism also works fine and easy to use it.Didn't take it on a plane, I don't know its airport security performance.I used this one and the original one so far. Both smell I didn't like by any means. I gave this one away and using the original one. I hope I can find one with a fresh and soapy smell. The original has a smell like a pine resin. This one smells more acidic. Has nothing to do with aloe vera. But they both do the job so I surely will keep using this brand.Please don't risk your life by using antiperspirant chemicals and support these guys. Also someone with experience in gathering a good smelling mix, please give a hand to these guys, they are pretty much better than good with the rest of the objectives they need to achieve.",

                "reviewText": "This deodorant is the best natural deodorant i\u2019ve ever bought. Over the past year and a half, i have tried every scent they make, except for Sport. The first few time\u2019s i ordered through Amazon, i received the product with broken tops, and have never received a single response from the company. However, i like the product so much, that i ordered many more, and most of them have been fine. The \u201ccigar\u201d scent, smells like a fresh cigar (unlit). The Aloe is fresh cut.. clean smelling, perfect for summer. One of my favorite\u2019s is the, only occasionally available, coconut. It smells exactly like the Hawaiian sun tan lotion from when i was a kid. Love it! The \u201cBay\u201d scent.. smells like you just went to the barber shop for a hair cut. Leather.. scent.. smells NOT like a watch band, but instead.. like leather from the leather shop (however the smell changes within a few hours to one i didn\u2019t like). The same with Vetiver .. at first.. it smells like your sitting around a campfire and brings back awesome memories.. however.. within an hour or two.. it begins to smell like an electrical fire (really strange and gross). The oak moss has a nice \u201cwoodsy\u201d smell to it and is nice for daily wear. However.. bar none.. my favorite.. is Cederwood. It smells like fresh cut cedar when you put it on.. and throughout the day. Never had to \u201creapply\u201d the cederwood either. Chestnut is also pretty good.. smells like the interior of an old hotrod.. if you\u2019ve ever owned a classic car.. you\u2019ll know what I mean. Original scent smells like the original \u201cright gaurd\u201d\u2026 As for \u201csage lime\u201d.. it smells clean and summery at first, but is not that good within a few hours.Basically.. as far as natural deoderant\u2019s are concerned. This company\u2019s products actually smell like the name implies (unlike other companies attempts). They have a large selection for men, woman, other(s). They last all day without needing to be reapplied..My only advice is to take the companies advice\u2026 apply with one swipe up, and one swipe down the other side.. another words \u201cless is more\u201d.. if you over apply.. it will burn .. leave stains.. or cause trouble. Adding more.. will NOT make it work better, or last longer. On average. A container last me a few months because of how thin you apply it. If your switching from an anti-persperant to this product, it will take a few days for your body to adjust. You can also do this\u2026 if you take a shower at night\u2026 you can use an anti-perperant (especially an unscented one.. if done this on the hottest days of the summer), and the next morning.. after showering, apply Sams (the scent you love the most). This will make you sweat less during the worst summer days, while still using the scent you love the most. I\u2019ve only needed to do this a few times in a year. I used another product, which is a pad containing simply the anti-persperant (called sweat block; which last up to seven days and is unscented), and then used Sam\u2019s as normal; during 100 degree days. Even on day\u2019s that are in the eighties and nineties.. Sam\u2019s works fine on it\u2019s own.As for staining\u2026 i\u2019ve only had one Sam\u2019s product cause stains.. and that was the Coconut one. Because it has coconut oil i assume.. this one caused problems. However, for the most part, Sam\u2019s washes out of clothing very well.Summary: I have tried numerous \u201cnatural\u201d deodorants.. and Sam\u2019s in bar none.. the best. It smells like the name implies.. last longer than other \u201cnatural\u201d deodorant\u2019s.. doesn\u2019t stain clothing (except for the one i mentioned). And, even though it is expensive.. you put it on so thinly.. that it lasts as long as any other deodorant you might buy.",

                "reviewText": "*EDIT* (2/22/18)After use for about a month I need to amend my review of this product. While I still am using it and like how it works, I have had mild irritation that will not go away. I don't know if it is an ingredient or what the cause is. Both underarms right in where the arm meets the torso has a small rash in that area. It isn't really all that noticable unless I look at it but still there. I do have sensitive skin so that might be the cause, but the odd thing is that it is not everywhere I use the deodorant. I use one swipe top to bottom, but that isn't where the irritation occurs, so I am not totally sure the cause. I still would recommend this product, but felt the need to update the review. I also have taken one star off for this, and will replace if I can figure out the exact cause and that it isn't caused by this product.*EDIT*I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by this deodorant! The scent is awesome and works perfectly with my other products that I use. (beardbalm, cologne, ect.) I have been using aluminium free deodorant for a while so I didn't have to worry about the \"adjustment\" period which was nice. I will say that if I put more than one swipe on, that I have seen some irritation occur. Other than that this deodorant works really well. I can go a full 24 hrs without starting to smell at all, much better than the 6 hrs from my last deodorant. Overall I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a better product that works and offers a nice variety of scents to choose from!",

                "reviewText": "I've used a lot of natural deodorants. Most don't really work for me, at least by the end of the day they start to fail. Sam's works! All day, no issues. It goes on pretty dry. Took me a bit to get accustomed to applying it - it has a fairly high amount of baking soda so is a bit gritty going on. But it absorbs quickly leaving clean and dry skin, no mess and nothing left to stain clothing. I got the patchouli scent, which I love. The scent is subtle, not over-powering. I also have fairly sensitive skin. A lot of deodorant products give me a rash. I had no rash issues with Sam's. I think next time I'll try the cedar, which I'm seeing good reviews about. :)",
