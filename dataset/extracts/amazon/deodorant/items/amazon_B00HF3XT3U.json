                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Strong Odor Protection",
                "reviewText": "As someone who leads an active lifestyle and values effective odor and sweat protection, I decided to give the Secret Clinical Strength Anti-Perspirant Deodorant Soft Solid a try. This particular variant promises a light and fresh scent along with clinical-level protection. After using it consistently for a few weeks, here's my take:Pros:Strong Odor Protection: The Secret Clinical Strength Soft Solid delivers on its promise of keeping odors at bay even during intense physical activities and long days. I found the protection to be superior to many other regular deodorants I've tried.Long-Lasting: The longevity of this deodorant's effectiveness is impressive. It held up remarkably well even through strenuous workouts and busy days, making reapplication unnecessary.Gentle Scent: The \"Light & Fresh Scent\" lives up to its name. It's not overpowering and complements my personal fragrance without clashing. The subtlety of the scent is a definite plus.Soft Solid Formula: The texture of the deodorant is creamy and applies smoothly. It doesn't feel gritty or sticky on the skin, and it dries relatively quickly.Clinical Strength: This deodorant lives up to its \"clinical strength\" claim, which is a major selling point for those who struggle with excessive sweating or are seeking a more potent solution than standard deodorants.Cons:Residue on Clothing: While the formula dries relatively quickly, I did notice a minor issue with white residue on darker clothing. It's important to apply the product sparingly to avoid this.Price: Secret Clinical Strength Anti-Perspirant Deodorant Soft Solid is pricier compared to regular deodorants. However, considering its clinical-level protection, the price is reasonable for those seeking enhanced performance.Final Thoughts:Secret Clinical Strength Anti-Perspirant Deodorant Soft Solid, Light & Fresh Scent 1.60 oz is a solid option for individuals in need of heavy-duty odor and sweat protection. Its gentle and understated scent makes it suitable for various occasions. While there's a slight learning curve to applying the right amount to avoid residue, the long-lasting and powerful protection it offers makes it worth the investment. If you're someone who struggles with excessive sweating or simply values a deodorant that can keep up with your active lifestyle, this product is worth considering. Just be mindful of the application process to ensure a seamless experience.",

                "reviewText": "I never had a problem with sweat like I do now since having a significant uptick in my anxiety lately. My old deodorant literally was doing nothing to help, and it is not a lie that stress sweat is the worst. So, imagine already being anxious and then sweating and not being able to hide that, only further adding to the stress and anxiety. Horrible. I finally faced it I may need \u201cclinical\u201d strength, but wanted something that didn\u2019t feel or smell... medical? I guess. I still wanted to feel feminine and clean without the sweating or a gross deodorant that either didn\u2019t work or just made me even more aware that I have a sweating issue thanks to being extra strength. This deodorant is perfect on every level - AMAZING scent, dries invisible, lasts all day, and keeps the area dry. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s clinical in any way other than it works better, it still reminds me of a standard deodorant but one that actually stands up to anxious people like myself. I\u2019m so happy!",

                "reviewText": "I am a fan of Secret Clinical in general but the Clean Lavender is my favorite. I mostly must order it online as this scent is not available locally - and I am happy to do it. It does a good job - lasts over 24 hours if you need it to. Glides on comfortably. No white residue. Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest, personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. I also refuse to 'change' my review for a refund of a product I have given a poor review - and that is offered from time to time. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so, to give you a little more info about me, I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). It's a shame they phased this rating system out because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer. I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6,200 reviews posted, those reviews have been viewed well over 50,000 times, including well over 26,000 likes. BOTTOM LINE: I pay for all my stuff, just like you do.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly i first used this peoduct because my sister had it and I didn't bring my deodorant with me when visiting. I was impressed by the scent that wasnt too sharp or too weak. It was in the summer and even though I sweat a lot (thank you hyperhydrosis), the deodorant didnt run off or quit working so the longevity was amazing. Plus my underarms usually get hot which adds to the deodorant not working because of the exceeding warmth. Yet it did work amazingly well. Now I bought it (even though I was affronted by the cost when i first researched it) and not sure I ever want to use a different kind. I'm wearing it now in the winter and its not chalking up on the underarm of my shirt. Very VERY pleased with the product just wish it were cheaper but Clinical Strength must mean supreme quality! People should buy this product!!",

But I find that if I\u2019m having a super stressful day or I am working out or I am running around in a hot and sweaty environment all day long my deodorant, quits halfway through the day. Now I work in a classic car garage, so I get dirtier and sweatier than most human beings. I find that the BO always returns around midday.",
