Them days are behind me now. I can safely enjoy upto 72hours of effects (with daily application) from just a couple swipes. I use this after a shower, before I go to sleep for the night. There is no overpowering or obnoxious scent. Which I love. At day one, this thing puts in work, and stays clocked in. Both my boyfriend and I enjoy this product and haven't needed to worry about pit stains again. Oh, I might mention that I have tested this in the hot hot HOT desert temperatures. 80 degrees, no problem, 90, not budging, 100\u00b0+, took the challenge like a champ!!! This is on my top 5 favorite products of 2023. 10 out of 10. A must buy.",

                "reviewText": "There are some things that could certainly be improved about this deodorant, but given its specific goal of relieving persistent symptoms and the necessary ingredients they have to use, that may not be possible. The texture can be a little stiff but usually after rubbing it on your skin a little bit it starts to soften up. If you get very liberal with your application, you will notice that it combines with your sweat to cake a little bit. That seems relatively normal and if it didn't do then it probably wouldn't do its job properly when you are really really sweaty. This really isn't a deodorant that you should be using consistently. These chemicals are pretty harsh even though this one is seriously the most sensitive one I've ever found. Overtime, people are bound to complain about using harsh chemicals to stop glands from functioning. We have to think about that. I used a prescription deodorant once that made my skin sting so this one is amazing to have just a normal deodorant to apply.",

It also pills very quickly after applying it, leaving small clumps of product on the armpit. As of now, I'm not sure if I would repurchase before trying other brands (which I'm not familiar with, so I can't really compare).",

                "reviewText": "I have always struggled with sweating too much, even when I am being very healthy. It used to cause me so much embarrassment when I was a teen, and even as an adult I always opt for a top with open air to the armpits if I can help it. Now, this deodorant doesn't completely make sweat vanish, but OMG does it help SO much. Especially if I'm indoors for work, I never come home with sweat stains on my shirt anymore. The smell is a nice neutral fresh scent/powder smell, definitely very gender neutral if you're concerned about that. Sometimes if I put too much it will clump into little white balls that fall all over the place, but that is user error from years of applying too much deodorant trying to solve my sweat. Excellent anti-perspirant! Would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I used to buy the roll-on presentation which was great at keeping me dry for like 3-4 days before reapplying at night. The downside was that it caused me so much itching, redness and dryness. It was a a real pain! So I tried this solid option. This one does not cause me any harm. The smell is soft (Roll-on is smell-free). It doesn\u2019t cause me itching or dryness or redness. I have to reapply every other day at night, and this is only in the middle of my armpits, where the sweat glands are. I don\u2019t apply on the sides. I apply only once up and down, no need for more. Next day, I shower and clean my armpits as usual. Highly recommended. Best of all, it lasts forever. I bought a pack of three, enough for a lifetime.",
