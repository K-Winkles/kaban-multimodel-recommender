I would literally just be sitting in a chair and for no reason my body would be sweaty. I only wore certain color shirts as a kid because I was self conscious. I tried so many different deodorants. I was probably 18 or so when I tried this deodorant out and it helped with the sweating so so much! I\u2019ve been using it ever since and haven\u2019t had issues with my sweating since.

                "reviewText": "Recently I noticed that my Secret for women underarm deodorant was not working as effectively as it used to. How did I know? Well...when washing my shirts, the pit stains and lingering odor was my first clue and second clue. I have heard that you can develop a \"resistance\" to products over time, or maybe it was due to hormone changes? Who knows? All I knew was that I had to fix this situation. The high ratings and reviews for this product motivated me to order the Dove Clinical Protection.Here is my take:1. Moisture Reduction: Excellent sweat reduction. I have noticed that the moisture marks on my darker shirts is much less than before. Note: I live in Arizona, and it is already 110 degrees and higher here. So my test in this regard was under extreme conditions and the results are all the more impressive.2. Smell Reduction: Excellent results-- Even after a long day, there are no body odors that are noticeable, and even at the end of the day, you can still smell the light fragrance, which is very appealing3. Chalky Marks on Clothes: Great results here--I used to struggle with white chalky marks on the bottom of my shirts when I put on my clothes after applying the deodorant. This does not happen with Dove Clinical Protection. And there does not appear to be a residue on the inside seam line of my armpits. I really appreciate that change!4. Cost: The cost seems high to me, and the amount of product in the container seems low. When you first receive the new dispenser, you have to turn the bottom dial until the creamy deodorant is pushed enough through the holes in the applicator cap. You have to turn the dial pretty far before the first amount is at the top...I estimate that it is less than half full. And for me, the amount that I dispense to cover both armpits seems to be depleting the container quickly. My estimate at this point is that one container may last for 3 weeks, but probably not longer. At almost $7.00 per container, this might get expensive for one person.Bottom Line: Love the performance, but dislike the small amount in the container and the higher price. You have to decide if your need for this high quality product is worth the cost. Right now, my answer is YES-- and I ordered 4 more to have them on hand.",

I was definitely nervous about trying this because honestly its a small amount for a higher price than i pay for the deodorant i had been using, i mean i could buy at least two of my old deodorants for this price but whatever, i needed something stronger so i went for it. let me tell you, i will wake up sweaty everywhere but my armpits now! i mean i will sweat nearly every place you can think of & my sheets will be wet but if my armpits sweat at all its almost nothing & it doesnt stink (although i usually never stink despite being a sweat monster? dont ask me how, my body is a mystery not meant to be understood) this stuff is amazing, the smell is nice too, definitely definitelyyyy makes a difference! I've had no bad reactions as well! my only complaints are the price for the amount is pretty harsh (mine also came a bit melted but seemed okay once it solidified again) but also the fact its not invisible, due to this i ONLY use it on my armpits & make sure i apply it without getting it on my dark/colored tank tops as it will leave white marks, i know its obviously made for your armpits but as an unholy sweat cryptid i would absolutely apply this to the back of my knees if it wouldn't leave residue behind. so if yall made a body powder/body powder spray that worked this well i would hand over my soul without a second thought. just sayin. overall i definitely recommend trying this if you too are a sweaty beast & are tried of it!pros: saved me from drowning in my own armpit sweat, smells nicecons: pricey+small amount & leaves white residue",

So that's a con but the pros are: keeps my BO at bay, lasts all day, smells good, doesn't rub off (if you wait 5-10 minutes before putting clothes on)The deodorant stays on so you'll need to scrub it off in the shower or else it'll still be on there.",
