It glides on a lot smoother due to its fluffy consistency, but this causes it to run out in about 2 weeks. The Dove does smell nice, but the wife likes the Mitchum more. The Dove says 96 hour protection though I did not experience more than 24 hours, which is the same experience I have with the Mitchum.This is my opinion. I know which one I am going to continue to buy.",

                "reviewText": "This product far exceeded my expectations. Keeps you drier than other brands. The scent is extremely light, not cloying in any way at all. The anti-perspirant continues to work even after showering. The thin layer of stuff (sticky layer) remains for up to two or three days, but when you shower, of course, the body odor is removed. Allowing you to use this at night before bed. Allow it to dry.. and then the next morning, one can choose a non-antiperspirant with a better scent, because the anti\u2026 is still active for you. Worked from the first time i used it\u2026 even though i walked in ninety five degree heat. Of course your going to sweat, but not like before. And then after the second time i used it, i could alternate between this product and the better smelling Sam\u2019s deoderant\u2019s such as cedar etc etc.. when the sweat started to become something to deal with again, i once more applied this product before bed as instructions state to do. Ad infinitum \u2026 well worth the money. One also does not need to rub this in back and forth in ridiculous amounts. Use a thin layer, once up one side of the \u201cpit\u201d\u2026 down the other. And that\u2019s all you need to do. It does NOT destroy one\u2019s clothing with stains either. Perfect companion for summer heat. Will definitely recommend to others. As well as recommend people read the instructions on an anti-perspirant so it will work best. Who knew most of us were applying these wrong for so long? Lol",

It\u2019s only been three days, so things could change, but currently this product works amazingly well. 5/5",
