No white marks on black clothes and no yellow stains on white clothes. You'll look great all day and free from deodorant stains. This antiperspirant for men has a formula that cuts down on the stains that some antiperspirants leave behind when they mix with sweat and natural oils produced by your body. It also provides 72-hour sweat and odor protection to keep you moving and free to live life to its fullest. This antiperspirant deodorant stick also contains Degree's innovative MotionSense\u00ae technology. It works like this: unique microcapsules sit on the surface of your skin. When you move, friction breaks those microcapsules, and they release more fragrance. So, every time you move, Degree keeps you fresh and free from odor. This antiperspirant deodorant stick works as hard as you do, keeping you protected, so you can keep moving and stay active. Simply glide and get moving. At Degree, we're doing everything we can to help keep the planet moving.",

The main reason I purchased this brand is because it does not show on white shirts like old spice or other colored deodorants do. Plus, this two pack is much cheaper than buying a single stick at the store.",
