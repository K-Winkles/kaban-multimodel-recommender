                "reviewText": "Ok here\u2019s the deal. I\u2019m a busy girl, work too much, sleep too little & have a little anxiety. As a result the body compensates via sweat. I\u2019m naturally a little self conscious that I smell bad & if you can see my pit stains. So I said what the heck, lets try it. I hail-maryed it & put it on right after I showered about an hour(ish) before my 6hr bartending shift on a Saturday. Low & behold, it\u2019s none of that \u201cnatural,-all organic, vegan\u201d deodorant, BUT it does work. It works well at that. Not only were my pits dry, but so was my shirt & I didn\u2019t smell. I got the mountainside scent because I like a fresh/manly scent for my deodorant & if you\u2019ve ever used the Dove Mens \u201cfresh\u201d deodorant- it\u2019s literally the exact same scent. Which is a light fresh (slightly masculine) scent. Anyways, it\u2019s expensive but I\u2019ll be buying again.Also, all the previous reviews complaining about the container. Yes it is weird. It\u2019s not exactly ideal, but you also shouldn\u2019t be using exorbitant amounts of this stuff at a time. I got a good container & if you just use a littler at a time- you\u2019ll be fine. it\u2019s really not rocket science.",

                "reviewText": "Im going through menopause and hormonal changes have really amped up my sweating. My underarms were sweating through suit jackets and I was using \u2018clinical strength\u2019 deodorants from multiple brands. Nothing worked until this. Found after a little research and this stuff is truly amazing! No more sweating through clothes at my armpits. Does feel a little sticky when applied - which disappears quickly. A eucalyptus like smell I find clean and fresh. I have this on subscribe and save and I also started getting it for my teenage son who was also struggling to find an all day anti perspirant option. It really works. I have sensitive skin and have not had any breakouts either. If you need a sweat reducer/ eliminator this brand has a product that works well.",

Sadly, the item I got has problems dispensing equally across the surface: the product only comes out from the sides and the center is mostly blocked. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because it\u2019s sticky but then that should have been considered by the manufacturer in designing its container. I did experience lesser perspiration but not as much as I expected.EDIT: Changed my rating from 1 star to 4 stars. The seller reached out about my issue and kindly offered a replacement. I do find it weird that the new one I received has a different design: less but larger holes. I hope it's just a change they implemented recently and does not mean that the first one I received is fake.",

                "reviewText": "Carpe is an AMAZING product. I\u2019ve suffered from hyperhydrosis for years. I finally came across this product, looked at reviews on Amazon and were not too great but I wanted to give it a try. Originally purchased from carpe and I had a GREAT outcome. I\u2019m a big sweater for a girl I\u2019m 5\u20195, 135lbs and can still sweat so much. Carpe purchased from on site was great, was completely dry the smell was amazing and I never smelled because I never would sweat so scent was always fresh. (Recommend the fresh powder on carpe site, it\u2019s the only I\u2019ve tried but 10/10) downside is that it takes about almost 2 weeks to get delivered out so that\u2019s an inconvenience, I didn\u2019t realize I was running out, it lasted me about a month and since you can\u2019t see how much is in the bottle like you do with other deodorants, I never could tell how much was left but considering you\u2019re supposed to apply after shower before bed and again in the morning I can understand how it runs out fast. Fast forward, I run out and I order one from Amazon ASSUMING it was the same product- as you can see from packaging and labels it looks almost identical. The reviews were not good with people saying it had a burn sensation, or it didn\u2019t stop the sweat, etc. very few good reviews but I knew it worked for me so I got it anyways. (Mind you I did order from carpe and did get on a auto ship for every so many weeks so this doesn\u2019t happen again but for the mean time I needed my Deo ASAP!) my first package from Amazon that got delivered had no deodorant in it, an empty package, no perforation damaged, nothing. I requested a new one and it came in the next day, when I opened bag it smelled like menthol, but I was like no way that\u2019s not the deodorant because that\u2019s not what I ordered and I know my original one didn\u2019t have that scent. Then I open the seal which was completely different than carpe originally sent me so I was confused if I ordered the wrong one but then realized they said the exact same thing. Long story long, do not waste your money on Amazon. Order directly from carpe website and you WILL NOT be disappointed. GREAT BRAND, GREAT PRODUCT! They have discount codes and also have auto ship so you never run out and it saves you money. Carpe will forever be something I repurchase, just not from Amazon.",

When I came across this, I read a lot of reviews and I was sold. The first day of use I put it to the test at the mall. Lots of walking, with a light shirt and fleece overcoat on, lots of people. It was hot in there but I stayed dry, not just at the mall but ALL DAY! No odor and no wetness. I did not expect it to work so well right off the bat. This is pricy, and I wish it was a little cheaper because I\u2019m not going to be able to live without it now. Also thankfully I did not have the same issue some had where they said the product was oozing out from the bottle after peeling back the foil. I also haven\u2019t had a problem with it leaking so far. If you sweat a ton, do not hesitate to buy this. It\u2019s life changing!",

It works great in terms of preventing sweat and I didn't have any rashes or burns with it. But they could do a better job with ensuring it lasts a while and packing.It's been like 6 months since I purchased it and although I still have plenty of product left, it's lost some of its moisture which makes it difficult to apply it. Since I first got it, it's been slowly oozing out of its container and now it's pretty much unusable. This is my main gripe with it and hopefully they can reformulate the formula so it's longer lasting.",
