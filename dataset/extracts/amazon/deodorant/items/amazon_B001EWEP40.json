                "reviewText": "If you\u2019re looking for a deodorant that covers up your odor for extended amount of time this is the deodorant for you. I have tried so many deodorants it\u2019s ridiculous. Especially during summer time when it seems like my other deodorants I thought that were the best ones I found work for 45 hours before I had to reapply because of my Stench it just wasn\u2019t good enough because basically I was applying deodorant over smell that was already there and it was making it worse so I would have to completely clean myself before applying fresh deodorant. I got tired some of this routine and looked for something that was even better and came across this and gave it a try. At first I just liked it because of the feeling as far as it felt kind of like it tightened my skin when it dried up because this is a gel but it was actually a good thing because it provided a barrier in the More area covered the better. This actually lasted I would say for a good 10 hours. Even though I know it says 48 hours in for sweat purposes yes this is great for that amount of time but I\u2019m just speaking about odor. At least for me it lasted the longest I love any deodorant I\u2019ve ever tried. I can see using this in other areas of my body as well but I have not tried it yet so I\u2019m not sure if it would irritate but would definitely try it. So if you\u2019re having issues finding something I would definitely give this a try. They have different scents so I\u2019m sure you can find a scent that you like. And the price is actually a lot cheaper than all the other clinical deodorant out on the market surprisingly.",

I love this brand, the powder scent, the fact that it goes on clear, and it's long-lasting effect. This 4-pack, however, contradicts my expectations. It does not have that powder scent at all like the individual sticks I've purchased from retail stores. I can best describe it as bland powder that's been left out for about 100 years with a hint of \"grandma\" smell.I'm not sure what it is and maybe it's just the batch I got. I didn't return it because after a few seconds, the deodorant kind of conforms to my scent and smells nice so it isn't a nose sore, but I would have appreciated having that awesome powder scent that I was expecting. I have mild regrets, but plan on trying again in the future and see if maybe this 4-pack was just bad luck. Nonetheless, it's still a great buy.",
