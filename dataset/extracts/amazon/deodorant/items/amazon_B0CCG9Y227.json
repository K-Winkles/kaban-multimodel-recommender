But - it holds up when I use the treadmill so that\u2019s nice.The scent is - interesting. It\u2019s a very sweet \u201cvanilla.\u201d Stronger scent than I\u2019m used to (I usually use dove mens clean comfort, which is a soft spiced baby powder fragrance and perfect for me, a woman). So this scent feels very loud, verrrrry sweet yet I wouldn\u2019t consider it a vanilla scent if I were to guess. It comes off as something more tropical? Can\u2019t quite put my finger on it. The price was decent for a 3 pack but one of the cans doesn\u2019t spray - that makes the price high-normal for just 2 antiperspirant bottles. I will go back to dove clean comfort. It smells so soft and doesn\u2019t intrude upon whatever perfume I\u2019m wearing that day. I want my underarms to smell nice - I don\u2019t want people to smell my deodorant thru my shirt. Secret Vanilla & Argan Oil smells too powerful for my liking. IF you deal with underarm oder - this may be to your liking, tho!",

Call Dove. Their spray deodorant works great.",

                "reviewText": "This deodorant has great staying power and dries down smooth in a flash, unlike some other spray deodorants that can leave a sticky feel. I first tried the peach scent when my usual vanilla was out of stock and I was pleasantly surprised - the peach actually smells light and fresh and not like the peach candy I was afraid of. I wish they made these in travel size too!",

                "reviewText": "I had been dealing with BO for a few months now. In the past, I never had a body odor, not even when I hadnt showered in a few days. But all of a sudden, about 3 months ago, I began to experience BO even after using deodorant... sometimes even after using two deodorants at a time. I changed out deodorants, I used different types to no avail. This BO would even occur halfway through the day with no physical exertion. I was concerned, but having not seen a doctor yet I wanted to see if I could stop it at home before I see the doctor. I was honestly not expecting this product to work, but it was on sale, so I said what the heck, let me try it. Well, as I write this, I have not showered in two days and I have no BO. None at all.. In fact, I smell good. I can literally smell peaches or whatever perfume they stuffed into that bottle of spray. I dont know by what mechanism this is occuring. I hope its not cancerous. But I have no BO. I was concerned that a deodorant this strong would be difficult to wash off my armpits, the way my antiperspirants tend to be, but its very easy to wash off. I have subscribed to recurring deliveries of this thing. It works.",
