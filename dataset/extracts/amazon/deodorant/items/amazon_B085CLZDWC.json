Mine just spray cold air and no deodorant comes out. Maybe sometimes the slightest bit but most often nine out of 10 times it just sprays cold airI bought six bottles of this and I\u2019m so let down. When I first tried them out, I had the same issue. I tried one more time getting the 72 hour protection and it worked perfectly fine. I only went back to this one because it was cheaper and I thought maybe my first time was just a bad batch. However I\u2019m on bottle already because it only sprays air. I probably won\u2019t be buying dove spray anymore but I may try one more 72 hour just to confirm they changed the formula and it works much better. Maybe the original one and 48 hour and discontinued and it won\u2019t be a problem and the future.",
