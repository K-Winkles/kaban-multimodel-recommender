I have noticed over the last 2 years that it seems to be burning my skin when I am very sweaty. That being said, it's still the best one out there imo. Certain scents don't mesh with my body chemistry like lemongrass etc, this one just works perfectly. I would recommend this brand and scent specifically to anyone looking to try a natural deodorant. You will sweat, that's what bodies are supposed to do, but you won't stink. It also never stains my clothing which is a plus.",

My husband's brand ran out on a trip, so he used my deodorant. He liked it! Our out-of-state daughter ran out of her brand while visiting us, tried mine, and immediately placed an order on Amazon. (She also likes a couple of the other scents because they are not overwhelming. Then, her 12-year old son got that stinky adolescent aroma and his mom told him to try Schmidt's after showering. Another fan! It sure makes it easy to buy deodorant when others use the same type. The travel size is a perfect, practical, if not unusual, stocking stuffer.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using Schmidt's Charcoal for over 5 years. It's Aluminum Free & not an antiperspirant. Above all, it works exceptionally well. The Charcoal prevents any odor REALLY well. Again, it's not an antiperspirant, but those types of products are NOT HEALTHY. That said, I never seem to sweat a ton with this on.... and again the ODOR protective is the BEST I've ever experienced with such a product. It goes only fairly easy, and there is a slight residue (be careful putting on a shirt afterward). It's all natural and VERY high quality. Now for the negatives: 1) At $9 to $12, it's VERY expensive 2) at 2.65 oz, each convenient stick doesn't last that long. Of course, many brands have, in the last 3 years, skyrocketed in price... so?? BOTTOM LINE: If you want REAL 24 hour protection against ODOR in an all-natural products that have a very pleasant sweet charcoal scent (really nice scent - NOT overpowering), this is GREAT product.",

I've noticed with this product that it helps control your secretion of odor even if you didn't apply it today. I've applied this product in the morning, came home after a 8 hour shift, showered, went to the gym, came home, and still no odor.",

The smell isn\u2019t the best but that fades pretty quickly and then no smell at all!! I\u2019m a customer for life!",

                "reviewText": "Have been avoiding all aluminum in deodorant for close to 20 years. Have tried so many! Most are useless, don't do a thing. This stuff is champion. It completely works. Fragrance is fresh, citrusy, I'd say more feminine than masculine. Once applied I don't actually smell it. It is powerful, it works, and easily into the next day if needed. I couldn't find it as easily in the stores lately :( so I tried a few others including my husband's A&H unscented which works fine; I find that this one is more effective.",
