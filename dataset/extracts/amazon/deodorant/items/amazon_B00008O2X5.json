                "reviewText": "I have super sensitive skin and this causes no irritation at all. You can apply it even after shaving your underarms and it doesn't hurt, burn or sting. I've used it for several years and it also doesn't react when you sweat and cause irritation or staining or residue on your clothing.It's clear and soaks into the skin quickly. It doesn't rub off or leave any residue (clear or white) on your clothes and I've never gotten staining on anything from it (even delicate items like silk shirts).The secret to it working is that you need to apply it after you shower (after drying your underarms). And you need to also apply it at night before bed (if you shower in the morning, if evening or night then after your shower is fine). I apply it twice a day (when getting dressed, after a shower or before bed) usually.There is no scent to it at all. It does what it's supposed to and keeps you fresh and clean. It works well, is inexpensive, gentle and doesn't harm your clothes. I don't even try others, this is so good and it works so we'll it's the only one I'll use. I tried quite a few brands of drugstore deodorants in clear, invisible (scented and non scented, I prefer non scented) and this works better than anything I've used.",

I also stay dry in stressful situations with this gel.The packaging is simple. Because of this, I believe the savings are passed on to the consumers. Thank you, Almay for making a great product.",

                "reviewText": "I was having an allergic reaction to my deodorant, and my dermatologist recommended this one to try. I normally use a solid deodorant so this liquid gel is quite different.It\u2019s totally wet going on and needs to dry. A half an hour after applying it was sticky on one side. Turns out it hadn\u2019t dried completely, so after lifting that arm up for a bit, it dried. Stickiness was gone after drying.I sweat quite a bit. This deodorant does not stop sweating, but it does cut down on the yucky smell.Overall, I\u2019ve had no bad skin reaction to this sensitive deodorant so I\u2019m pretty happy with it.",

In my desperation I bought and tried different deodorants: Very expensive, natural, spray, stick, roll-on, gel and every time I thought I had found a good one, one or two days later my armpits would looked like they were burned, very red and itchy. In my desperation I saw a video on YouTube where they reviewed the best deodorants for people with sensitive skin and one of the people who commented on the video talked about this deodorant. So I bought it and glad I did!! It is absolutely the best deodorant I have ever used in my entire life!! I have no irritation, it doesn't leave my armpits dark, I don't smell bad and it's cheap!! At first I was worried about the feel of the gel, but after applying it, it dries so my armpits don't feel wet. Perfect!!!",

A fair number of people are allergic to propylene glycol, and I've suspected I am. My fault for not paying more attention to the ingredients before ordering. I wish the company wouldn't include a fairly common allergen in a sensitive skin product.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been looking for deodorant that does not irritate my skin. I usually get very itchy under arms from normal deodorant. I\u2019ve tried a bunch of natural ones, but they just leave me sweaty and I don\u2019t like that feeling. What I love about this one is that I can crank it up just a little bit and I use my fingers. I use half of one underarm and then half the other, if that makes any sense. This also makes the deodorant last a very long time. Therefore, getting more for my money. It doesn\u2019t take much at all to be effective. Also, Dr. Dray from YouTube, deodorant works really well if you apply some at night. Which I do so I can easily apply this twice a day with no irritation. I put it on AutoShip.",

I read a review by someone else with the same problem as I have with deodorants, ie., sore itchy underarms after using for about 3 days, and it was mentioned that these Almay ones didn't cause a problem. There is another Almay one here on Amazon so I ordered both. Happy to say, so far so good, no problems. So, my thanks go to the lady who reviewed either this one or the roll-on one, and thanks to Amazon for including Almay in the listings.",
