Antiperspirants have it, deodorants don\u2019t. Aluminum salt, the active ingredient in antiperspirant, is the only ingredient FDA-approved to help fight sweat. When you apply an antiperspirant, the salt dissolves in the sweat at the surface. Deodorants don\u2019t contain an aluminum active ingredient to fight sweat but do protect against odor. If that\u2019s all you need, grab a stick or spray that is aluminum free. *Aluminum active ingredients, such as aluminum zirconium/chloralhydrate Which is better? Contrary to popular belief, one isn\u2019t better for you than the other. Secret Aluminum Free deodorant is made with advanced odor fighters and pH balancing minerals to help eliminate odor instead of just masking it, AND it provides up to 48 hours of odor protection. What is deodorant made of? Please refer to the list on the back of the carton for more details. This product is free of parabens, dyes, talc & baking soda.",

This is important to me, because I am prone to \"glow\" (sweat) anytime I get really warm. Although not an anti-perspirant, it seems to inhibit the sweat a bit. I don't mind the perspiration as much as having an odor! The vanilla scent is subtle, pleasant, and fades down soon after application, which is fine. I also love that it is in a solid from, not liquid. Will definitely buy again!",

This purchase is different. I don\u2019t know if the formula has changed, but I no longer can reliably count on one application a day to get the job done. If I do not reapply after 6-8 hours, I may end up smelling not-so-sweet. This deodorant is also not \u201cinvisible\u201d and can clump up in the underarm area, so be careful if you are wearing anything sleeveless. Would I repurchase it? Probably not. I\u2019ll be looking for an alternative aluminum-free deodorant product when I finish up this 3 pack.",

This formula has been working really well for me. It holds up through the day. Hasn\u2019t caused me grief.Give it a try!",
