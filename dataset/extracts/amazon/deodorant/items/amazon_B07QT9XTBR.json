This is important to me, because I am prone to \"glow\" (sweat) anytime I get really warm. Although not an anti-perspirant, it seems to inhibit the sweat a bit. I don't mind the perspiration as much as having an odor! The vanilla scent is subtle, pleasant, and fades down soon after application, which is fine. I also love that it is in a solid from, not liquid. Will definitely buy again!",

This purchase is different. I don\u2019t know if the formula has changed, but I no longer can reliably count on one application a day to get the job done. If I do not reapply after 6-8 hours, I may end up smelling not-so-sweet. This deodorant is also not \u201cinvisible\u201d and can clump up in the underarm area, so be careful if you are wearing anything sleeveless. Would I repurchase it? Probably not. I\u2019ll be looking for an alternative aluminum-free deodorant product when I finish up this 3 pack.",

It\u2019s sweet and subtle.I\u2019ve tried numerous other aluminum free deodorants (native, toms, Lavanilla.) and I typically will end up with breakouts or a painful burn ring under my arms. This formula has been working really well for me. It holds up through the day. Hasn\u2019t caused me grief.Give it a try!",
