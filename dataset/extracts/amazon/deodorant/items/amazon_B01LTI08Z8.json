                "reviewText": "I have a very embarrassing problem. My body sweats even when I'm not hot and I emit an odor that makes me smell like I just ran 5 miles. Granted, I am a lot more sensitive to both of these issues than other people are. None of my exes even knew I had this issue but I feel like I'm wearing a neon sign that yells \"LOOK AT ME!! I'M WEIRD!!\"I have finally figured out that if I wear a sleeveless top with a sweater over top I can beat the sweat marks. Enough air is passed over my armpits that it dries them out enough to not leave the dreaded pit stains. But then there's the smell. Even after I just take a shower, I can still smell it lingering on my skin.It isn't BO exactly, it just smells like I've recently been working out or sweating a lot. So I've been trying to find a clinical deodorant that can combat both of these issues. I can't even tell you how much money I've spent on deodorants over the years. I've even made my own using all-natural ingredients and went so far as to \"detox\" my pits from the aluminum today's deodorants put into our skin. I thought I had a winning combo of ingredients but alas, it was not meant to be. Plus it was kind of a pain in the butt to get the stuff on. You had to apply it with your fingers and rub it in. Not the best way to apply deodorant.I've also tried this super-strong deodorant you apply at night every other or every third day that is supposed to stop you from sweating. It was mucho mucho expensive. I honestly can't say that it did anything for me. Or if I did, it wasn't very noticeable.Every time I go to the grocery store I stop by the deodorant aisle to see if they have anything new on their shelves. My usual go-to deodorant brand is Degree but it stopped working for me a couple of months ago and I couldn't find their Clinical formula at any of my local stores.So I turned to my best friend Amazon. =) In my search for Clinical Degree, the product listing for Secret came up so I thought \"why not\" and bought it. I honestly didn't have high hopes since every other deodorant has let me down. My package arrived late in the afternoon and I take my daily showers in the early morning but I figured what's the harm and applied some of the deodorant to my armpits before bed.Typically, when I wake up in the morning, I don't smell very nice. I have to take a shower every day or I will literally sit here and smell myself all day and that is just gross. But when I woke up the next day, I didn't smell anything. I leaned over and took a deep sniff of my left armpit. It smelled lightly of powder. So I smelled the right. Same deal. I couldn't believe it. I didn't stink!So I decided to REALLY put it to the test and hopped on my treadmill. I ran for a little over 30 minutes and I had sweat running off of me. I KNEW I was going to stink now. I repeated my earlier action: I sniffed my left armpit then my right. Again, I caught the light scent of powder, but nothing else. No BO, no sweaty Veronica, nothing.Holy cow I thought! This is too good to be true. So I took my shower and applied the deodorant then at the end of the day when I would normally have an odor I sniffed again. No bad smell. At all.I really didn't expect this deodorant to work so it has more than exceeded my expectations. I occasionally write reviews on Amazon but I have NEVER reviewed a deodorant. Never. But I couldn't wait to sit down at my desk and tell you my story. If my story helps just ONE person put an end to an embarrassing situation in their life, then that makes all of my trials and tribulations worth it. I do wish Amazon would let people comment on other people's reviews in case you had questions so I could answer them. But alas, they do not.I hope my review helped you and if it did, please hit the little button below. It would mean so much.",

I bought this for my teen daughter as her perspiration was totally out of hand! Her shirts would be soaked even if she was just sitting there. She also had a strong 'onion' smell to her sweat as well. We tried everything - even very big name products promising to eliminate odor. Nope. They didn't, and they didn't touch the sweat! I didn't expect this to work, but I was on my last try. IT WORKS!!!! It lasts and it has not caused any problems on her skin. I started using it as my skin chemistry has changed with menopause and I was not loving my own new 'scent'. It is so gentle and works forever! No, really, easily works for 48 hours! It is so much better to buy this way - better price and I can get exactly what I want when I want it. It is so often bought out at the local stores.",

And this is coming from a girl who excessively sweats and stinks just by sitting down and doing nothing! This deodorant has kept me dry and odor free ALL DAY until the next morning. It is a miracle product for me that I always keep reaching for. I don\u2019t even have to reapply during the day because it works that well. And on top of that I love the scent! I hate the floral and powder scents so this one is the best of them all where it is sporty.The only drawback is the price since it is costly compared to other products, but the way it works is worth every penny.",
