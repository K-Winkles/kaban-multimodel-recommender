Some don't work, some are so much money for what you get and others fall apart or melt with the slightest of warmth in a bathroom.This is mess-free...period! It rolls on, the deodorant doesn't slip down the side of the applicator and get all over the lid/cap. It works until it's gone, no mess EVER!!! I've never had that with regular deodorant or natural before.There is no scent. I've purchased deodorants before that say \"unscented\" and it ends up being BS. This just works. No scent from the product and I don't have a scent for the entire day.A reminder that this is NOT anti-perspiring. You will sweat... you just won't wreak like you would if you didn't have this on.Great purchase. Unless they change the formula my search is done!",

I\u2019ve tried SO many expensive deodorants that claimed to be for sensitive skin and within a couple of days the rash appeared. Most of them dealt with BO just fine, but at a big price, constant burning and itching. So, I kept searching and tried one more. I\u2019ve been using this daily for four months. No itch, burn or stink. Honestly, yes, it\u2019s expensive, but all deodorant is expensive and this one actually works for my ridiculously sensitive underarms. It might not work for you since we are all different, but I urge you to give it a try is nothing else has worked.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second pack of 3 I've purchased from the Each & Every brand. I explored the Lav/Lemon, Citrus/Vetiver, and Coconut/Lime scents this time. Let's talk about it... 1) I like to NOT scrape my pits on the plastic, SO I start with a decent amount of deo. above the plastic tube; However, leaving the deo that high up will get smooshed by the cap. So, i always roll it down. The twisting mechanism is easy to roll up and down without issue. The tube can also be recycled (HDPE 2). 2) The formula is soft, smooth, moisturizing and a little GOES A LONG WAY! I made the mistake of going over my pits too much (applying too much product) and it gets VERY wet. It's never *sticky* for me, but the wetness is just uncomfortable and a waste as it just seems to melt off. When i applied too much, it also plugged my pores and I'd have painful red lumps (boils) appear! No thanks.. lesson learned. 3) The scents are usually quite lovely and not overbearing. Obviously, things smell differently to everyone and once applied, ppl's body chemistry will alter the smell, still. That being said, the Lav/Lemon is just wonderful and if you love lavender, you'll love this one. The first pack also had a Rose scent and a Geranium/Mushroom scent (i think that's the right blend ??). The rose was true to the name and not overbearing. Obviously quite floral. The Geranium/Mushroom was a soft scent and i could see why it'd be considered more neutral. However, there was still a subtle floral quality to me. The second pack was different... If you love a coconut smell, then the Coconut/Lime is just for you-- it's warm and tropical, esp when it hits the heat of your body. I was hoping for more of a balanced smell. For whatever reason, the Coconut lime verbena from B&BW smelled different and good. Maybe it was the addition of the verbena. Anyway, this one was overbearing and I couldn't stand the smell of the Coconut, which became the prominent smell once applied. The Citrus/Vetiver was *more* balanced than the Coconut/Lime, but still favored the Vetiver. Apparently i dislike Vetifer... it smells almost astringent-like to me. Can't describe it well. The citrus was obvious, but softer and more of a secondary smell. I wished it shined through more. 4) I work in a busy dialysis clinic, walking fast all day, constantly moving, wearing awful PPE gowns (that are impervious to blood and \"other\" fluids), a mask, and a freaking face shield. If you've had the pleasure of wearing them, you know what I'm talking about. I feel like a popsicle in an oven. That being said, i obviously sweat, BUT AMAZINGLY, i don't stink-- at least, no one has told me so (and we're pretty open and honest with each other, being together so much!)!! Sure, it starts to wear away. But by the end of my 12-13hr shift, I'm not *sticky*, i can still walk in public, and i don't leave a trail of flies and stink in my wake. I call that a WIN, folks! For me, deo. doesn't last more than 24hrs before i need to reapply. And it's not that i stink, it's just that the product has completely worn off/ melted off (?). Maybe if you don't have as much activity, then it could last 48hrs-ish ++. Lucky you! 5) Do i like the price tag?...Not really. What i do like 6) are the CLEAN ingredients. They're listed in Latin on the left, then listed in layman's terms on the right. THANK YOU for that! I appreciate the time that E&E took to make sure i was informed, even though i tell my husband i know everything, and hope he never really finds me out! These deodorants also do NOT contain baking soda which is often an irritant to ppl's skin-- and they don't even know until they've had the joy of hives under their pits!! You're welcome for the info ppl, which i found out the hard way.If you're on the fence, just fork over the money and try it. What is your health worth to you? I try to avoid known cancer-causing agents, esp right there at my pits, which are a hot spot for lymph nodes (the bundle of cells that connect my immune system from head to toe... think \"connect-the-dots\"). Hence clean ingredients are rather important, since they're going to travel around my body, eventually getting into my blood stream. Yes, your skin is the largest organ on your body and absorbs whatever you put on it.And lastly...7) I would have given it 5 stars had some of the more *daring* scents not made me nauseous. I should've bought the little travel-size pack with like 6 different scents, so i could see which ones I'd prefer to buy in the big tube.Best wishes!",
