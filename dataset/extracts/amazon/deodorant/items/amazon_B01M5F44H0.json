I\u2019ve used this for years and now and I sweat less and never, hopefully, stink. Just use it for a couple weeks to allow your body to adjust and you will see. Use traditional products too during the transition if needed.",

                "reviewText": "Hey, guys! I wanted to share my experience with the Crystal Mineral Deodorant Coconut Vanilla Roll-On. I recently purchased this for my girlfriend, who was on the hunt for a roll-on deodorant that dries quickly and doesn't contain any harmful chemicals. Let me tell you, this product has been a game-changer for her!First off, let's talk about the key feature she was looking for - fast drying. The Crystal Mineral Deodorant Roll-On delivers on that front. It goes on smoothly and dries rapidly, leaving behind no sticky or wet residue. That means she can get ready in a flash without worrying about any lingering dampness. It's all about convenience and efficiency, folks!What sets this deodorant apart is its commitment to using natural mineral salt as its active ingredient. No parabens, sulfates, phthalates, artificial fragrances, or colors are included in the formula. That's a big win for those who prefer products with clean ingredients. The Crystal brand has even received the Clean Label Project Purity Award for all their deodorants, which speaks volumes about their commitment to transparency and quality.Now, let's get into the nitty-gritty. The Crystal Mineral Deodorant Roll-On is designed to be gentle on the skin, which is a big deal for my girlfriend. She had experienced rashes from other natural deodorants in the past, but this one has been a game-changer. It's dermatologist tested and hypoallergenic, providing a worry-free application that keeps her feeling fresh throughout the day. Plus, it doesn't leave any streaks, white marks, or stains on her clothes. That's a win-win in my book!One of the standout benefits of Crystal's approach is that it allows the body to function naturally. Traditional deodorants block your pores, but Crystal works differently. By utilizing natural minerals, it helps control odors for up to 24 hours without interfering with the body's natural processes. It's pretty amazing when you think about it. Smelling good naturally and feeling confident all day long? Count my girlfriend in!Let's not forget the good vibes that come with using this deodorant. Crystal Mineral Deodorant is vegan, cruelty-free, safe, and effective. They never test their products on animals, and they use the cleanest, safest ingredients available. It's a brand that aligns with our values and allows us to make choices that are both conscious and effective.To sum it up, the Crystal Mineral Deodorant Coconut Vanilla Roll-On has been a fantastic find for my girlfriend. It ticks all the boxes she was looking for - fast-drying, chemical-free, and reliable odor protection for up to 24 hours. She loves the refreshing coconut vanilla scent and the fact that it keeps her feeling confident all day long. If you're on the lookout for a roll-on deodorant that combines effectiveness with clean ingredients, give Crystal a try. You won't be disappointed!Disclaimer: This review is based on my girlfriend's personal experience with the product. Remember, individual results may vary depending on skin type and preferences. It's always best to find what works for you. Stay fresh, guys!",

                "reviewText": "I love the crystal deodorant products. They prevent the BO instead of just trying to mask it with stronger smells like other deodorants. They also make showers much easier since it washes off relatively easily in the shower compared other deodorants I've tried that need me to double or triple check that I've actually washed off the deodorant and sweat from my armpits. It lasts 24 hours, but truly no longer than that. The roll ons are nice since I don't need to be next to a sink or bowl of water to apply it. While they wash off easily, I've never had an issue with sweating it off, even in the summer or after a gym session. You do sweat, but it doesn't smell.My one complaint is mostly my fault. I chose the vanilla and jasmine scent and it is STRONG smelling at first. Like heavy jasmine when I was hoping for a little more vanilla. After a while, the jasmine scent dies down and you can kinda smell the vanilla, but it's just overall not a scent that I like much. But again, that's mostly my bad since this is online shopping and I can't smell things through a screen.Overall, highly recommend these deodorants. Maybe not the jasmine and vanilla scent, but the product itself does an extremely good job.",

I don't think I'd buy it again, but it's not bad. It really has no scent whatsoever. That's great! Even some that say unscented, usually does have some sort of smell. ATM, I'm not able to do a workout or anything to make me sweat to test how well it works. So IDK how well it works with that. I think it's pretty much the same as others I've tried. The roll on is very wet though and so it's kind of an ew factor feeling. Besides that though, I really can't say anything to steer someone towards buying it or not buying it. It's just a preference really. If you like roll ons, you could really like this. If you don't, you won't like it. Or maybe you will. So all I can say is, try it and see.",
