Our products provide effective, all-day odor without the use of any harmful chemicals. No Aluminum, No Parabens, No Alcohol, No Harsh Sulfates, No Harmful Chemicals, No Worries! Before Fresh Kidz was created, parents of kids who had entered puberty faced a dilemma. There simply wasn't a range of hygiene products for pre-teens, \u2018tweens\u2019 and teenagers that were not only effective, but made kids feel confident using them. Keep It Kind, the brand behind the Fresh Kidz range, took this challenge head-on. With passion and personal experience, we made sure that our products fought against odor while never compromising safety. With over 20 years of pharmaceutical experience, our founders discovered that there was a huge need for a kids deodorant range that simply wasn't being filled. They went on to spend several years working closely with leading science laboratories, developing Deodorant formula for younger, sensitive skin and free from any potentially harmful chemicals. Our ultimate mission is to create a range of personal and skincare products for teens and tweens, that's both parents and kids love. We continue to research and develop products that are ideal for the modern, more informed generation of today.",

Here's why we gave it two thumbs up:Gentle on Sensitive Skin: My little adventurer has the skin of a delicate flower, but this deodorant plays nice. It's aluminum-free and baking soda-free, so no more itchy armpits or red rashes. We even tested it after a sweaty soccer game, and nada! Just happy armpits all around.Freshness that Lasts: Don't be fooled by the \"kid-friendly\" label. This stuff gets the job done. My tween son smells fresh and clean all day long, even after gym class and playground sprints. Bonus points for the subtle, kid-approved scents \u2013 no overpowering perfume smells here!Easy to Use: Say goodbye to messy sprays and sticky residues! This roll-on glides on smoothly, even my butter-fingered kiddo can handle it. The clear applicator makes it easy to see where they've applied, preventing missed spots and wasted deodorant.Fun & Practical: Forget boring white bottles! These brightly colored deodorants with playful designs are like little works of art themselves. My son actually enjoys using it, which is a win in my book. And the compact size fits perfectly in her backpack for on-the-go freshness.The Verdict: 5 out of 5 fragrant stars! Fresh Kidz Roll-On Deodorant has become a staple in our bathroom cabinet. It's gentle, effective, fun to use, and keeps my little one smelling fresh and confident throughout the day. Highly recommend for active kiddos of all sorts!P.S.

Makes a mess for no reason which is weird cause that\u2019s the reason why I change the paste to a roll on\u2026 cause my son always broke the paste and smushed it. This roll on makes as much mess which is NOT COMMON for roll on deodorants. Smells good, but I\u2019m a little disappointed .",
