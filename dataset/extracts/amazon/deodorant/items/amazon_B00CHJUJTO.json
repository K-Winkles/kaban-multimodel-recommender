                "reviewText": "I started using this many, many years ago. It's always been way more expensive than regular deoderant, but I have self-diagnosed hyper-hydrosis, and aside from the prescription stuff I used to stop the sweating in my late teens that may have had a small infinite effect, this did the trick as an adult. During Covid, when the price went from $7.xx per stick to over $10, I started using regular Degree. It smelled nice but certainly didn't keep me from sweating. I finally decided to bite the bullet, but accidentally purchased the Dove comparable. I was surprised my \"Degree\" wasn't working as it always had. I ordered it here, and like an old friend, it was tried and true the moment I used it. Fortunately, it was down to $8.xx. It creates almost a barrier on your skin... takes extra time wash off, but that's ok with me. I am confident and feel like myself again.",

                "reviewText": "I've used this Degree Clinical Protection deodorant for years and wouldn't even think about buying anything else. I'm Italian, which comes with many good qualities -- but excessive sweating is definitely NOT one of them. For much of my life, I dealt with the dreaded \"pit stains\" (yuck!!) and was so embarrassed. And then there was the smell of body odor-- if I didn't apply deodorant what seemed like hourly, I could smell myself. You can imagine how much fun this was in high school... living in Florida of all places. :/ I had almost given up on the idea and had even considered getting Botox injections to help cut down on the sweating, but then one day randomly got a coupon for this Degree Clinical Protection in the mail. For whatever reason, they actually didn't sell this line of deodorant in the grocery store I used to shop in so I'd never heard of it before. (Florida always seems to be lagging behind the times!) However, I was able to find it online (this was pre-Amazon Prime account for me... the dark ages!) When the deodorant arrived, I carefully read and followed the directions as I had done for all the other failed attempts at deodorants, but the next day, I honestly had almost no sweat under my arms and actually smelled good the entire day without once reapplying the deodorant. I thought that maybe it was just chance, but again, day after day, same amazing result. Finally-- no more humility and embarrassment, and no more sneaking off to the bathroom to reapply!If you've never tried this deodorant (or have tried it and didn't get the same results that I did) -- the secret it to apply it at night after you shower, and then reapply in the morning without washing off the previous night's application. I've tried skipping the evening application or even showering in the morning and then applying, but neither scenario works for me. It has to be applied in the evening and in the morning for the best results. On hot days, I usually reapply sometime in the mid- to late-afternoon \"just in case\" (or more so, just because I just like the scent). My favorite 2 scents are Summer Strength and Active Clean - both are very fresh smelling without being overpowering. I tried the Powder Fresh scent and personally thought it smelled like cheap baby powder. I also tried Fresh Energy and found it too floral and overbearing, and it also turned into more of a musty smell later in the day.I hope you have as great of an experience with this deodorant as I did! I don't usually write reviews this long, but this product has truly made a huge impact on my confidence and quality of life.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using Degree Clinical Protection Antiperspirant Deodorant in Stress Control, and it lives up to its 72-hour sweat and odor protection claim. The smaller 1.7 oz size is convenient for on-the-go use. The stress control formula adds a nice touch, and it has proven effective during busy and demanding days. The only downside is that it might be a bit on the pricier side compared to regular deodorants, but if long-lasting protection is a priority, it's worth the investment",
