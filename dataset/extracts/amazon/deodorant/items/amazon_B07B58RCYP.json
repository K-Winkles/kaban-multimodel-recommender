It really surprised me as that hardly ever happens! After three weeks I stopped using it and the odor stopped. I was better off using nothing as this product seems to activate something in my body to promote the odor. I guess it's not for every \"body\"!",

I applied it in the morning before a full day or work, then an afternoon CrossFit session, and I still smelled neutral after all of that! My only little nitpick is that it doesn\u2019t slide on your underarm very smoothly and tends to drag your skin a little. Definitely more malleable once it is a little warm. Other than that, I am in love!",

                "reviewText": "I had previously been using the cream form by Purelygreat, which I had added vegetable glycerin and bentonite clay to, to dilute the baking soda. It worked great to detox my pits and get used to the baking soda in the deodorant.I wanted to try out the stick version, but was initially skeptical because I had tried many other brands that weren't as effective. I had tried Green Beaver deodorant, which I found to be too sticky, and Schmidt's which I found too waxy (it left waxy buildup on my clothes). I'm glad to say that the Purelygreat stick leaves no residue on my clothes. In minimal activity, I can go almost 2 days with no stink and no reapplication. Super happy with this productThe baking soda might be an issue for sensitive skin but if you can get used to a diluted form like I did with the cream version, you can build up your tolerance.",

                "reviewText": "Previously, I used Speed Stick or some other big brand depending on price at the time my old deodorant would be close to finishing. However, my wife and her friend were talking about natural deodorants a few months back and her friend was saying something about her husband's friend being diagnosed with cancer under his armpits (I didn't realize that was possible). Thankfully, he beat the cancer, but mentioned something about not being able to use deodorant during treatment and couldn't wait to start using deodorant again. My wife's friend was like \"Are you nuts?\". This guy was apparently surprised and asked meekly, \"So, I shouldn't use brand name deodorants?\". Wife's friend answered with a \"Duh!\".So what does this story have to do with this product? Well, apparently, the big brands are loaded with cancer causing chemicals.My wife did some research and purchased another of Purelygreat's deodorants. However, I saw that process of stirring a stick in a jar before applying the deodorant confusing. So instead, she recommended I get this instead. According to her, this deodorant passed some skin care database or something.Frankly, I didn't understand what she meant, but not wanting to drag out the conversation about deodorant while not wanting to put harmful chemicals on my armpits, I bought one of these. It looks like the regular deodorant sticks I normally use. I'm good with that.First thing. I don't smell sweaty during the day. I've checked a few times when I felt sweaty especially during the plus 30 degree days we've been having. I don't smell like a guy in the middle of a 10k.Second thing. I like the smell of tea tree. It's been a while since I've used tea tree products. It's nice.Third thing. This deodorant doesn't go on dry. However, it's not the wet and sloppy one either. It's more in between. I've used both in the past. I don't have a preference. It's something to keep in mind if you like dry deodorant (where you can touch it and snap your fingers immediately) or wet deodorant (where you touch it, try to snap your fingers, and send deodorant gel flying in someone's face).Overall, I like this deodorant.",
