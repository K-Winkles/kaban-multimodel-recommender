For a men's deodorant, performance was more than adequate.One issue we found is the obvious one - there is no rational reason whatever for this material to suddenly cost 50% more than it did a few weeks before, and while the obvious \"supply chain,\" challenges are quoted (to the extent of nausea) that bloviation just does not hold water. Whether gouging or not, this optional applique is just that - optional - and the manufacturer needs to realize a difference between pricing vs need.Disclaimer: This review is part of the Amazon Vines Program in which reduced cost product is provided in exchange for forthright reviews. The product is NOT provided gratis as its value is taxable in the US. STG Synergies prides itself on producing honest, forthright reviews, product design, data analytics & data interpretation, and more to to product producers, business, and individuals, of which Amazon Vines is a part. Reviews are produced in a WP program and dropped in batch, thus no inference should be made regarding review quality against posting date/timestamps.
