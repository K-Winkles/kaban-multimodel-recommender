No need to wash off prior to intercourse or oral sex. Are Lume products safe to use during pregnancy & while breastfeeding? All Lume products are safe to use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Rest assured, Lume products were created by an OB/GYN with you in mind! Does Lume Deodorant require a pit detox? Lume does not require a transition period or detox to prevent irritation.

                "reviewText": "I really like Lume\u2019s clean, aluminum-free solid deodorant! It\u2019s my favorite, more natural deodorant that I feel works well and keeps me dry and smelling good! A lot of natural deodorants don\u2019t work as well, and you feel stinky before the day is done. I think I have tried most of the other brands! Lume solid works well for me, but everyone is different. I like the smell of the Peony Rose best, but there are other scents to choose from and an unscented as well. I will say, I only use this on my armpits. I know it\u2019s advertised for all body parts, but I can only speak from the perspective of pits lol I also have sensitive skin and had no problems with this product. I did try the soft Lume deodorant as well, and the tube, but the traditional solid is my favorite and I feel works the best for me. Its seems like it\u2019s gotten harder for me to find just a single of this deodorant in the Rose scent on Amazon, so I just got the 2-pack knowing it would last longer. Not sure why the single was so hard to get, maybe it\u2019s been restocked since I last bought! I def recommend if you are looking for an aluminum free deodorant that actually works. It is a little more expensive than some other brands, but it was worth it to me bc of being so affective! I\u2019ve been using this brand for well over a year if that tells you anything.",

It\u2019s a little pricey, but worth it for me.Now, the lotion is a whole \u2018nother animal. I just received it today and it\u2019s going into the trash. That stuff is disgusting. It smells nothing like the stick deodorant.I\u2019ve recently had surgery and haven\u2019t been able to shower very often, but with this, I don\u2019t smell like it. Three days post-shower I still smell as fresh.I LOVE this!",

                "reviewText": "I used this back when it first came out. I\u2019m happy to see that it is packaged as a solid stick and not a lotion pushed up through holes. The new peony rose is a nice addition and my preferred scent. For some reason, I don\u2019t like the new citrus. But I am definitely reordering the peony! It keeps all odor away for 24 hours. It also does a decent job with reducing perspiration, surprisingly! I did need to reapply daily.",

It might smell funny for a few minutes, but it works.These work like any regular stick deorderant. They do kill the smell. The lavender smells great. However, I don't think these are effective as the good bacteria version.",

                "reviewText": "I sweat very easily and once my shirt gets wet, I have about 60 minutes before I notice body odor. Most products that claim to provide 24-48 hour protection don't work at all on me. I recently tried a product that works better than anything else I have tried, and essentially solves my problem, but they don't make an unscented version. So I decided to try this product. I like to wear fragrances and the scented deodorants make it difficult for me to enjoy the fragrance I'm wearing, especially if it's a fragrance that I haven't tried before. I live in South Carolina and I have to walk for about ten minutes to get from my car to my office, and I wear a backpack. Even in cooler weather I notice perspiration that is enough to dampen the armpits of my shirt. The same thing happened today while wearing this product, so it was a perfect test. Today I was able to leave work early, so I waited two hours and then went home, repeating the walk outside. I took my shirt off at home and it was definitely damp in the pits. However, I didn't notice any body odor on my armpits, and this product is virtually unscented, and I was able to enjoy the fragrance I was wearing. Unfortunately, my shirt didn't make it. For some reason the active ingredients in this unscented product can't prevent some body odor from developing in fabric. I will say that the odor was much less than I usually notice; I had to try hard to detect it, but it was definitely there, and that's just not good enough for me because I know that I can't make it through the day without freshening up. I have job interviews coming up that will last all day, and I have to travel, so I won't be taking this product on my trip. I wore a 100% cotton polo shirt, which usually does a little better than synthetic materials, and the scented product I use is able to kill the odor even after the shirt gets damp, so I'm going to stick with that. I think this would work well for short durations, or situations where you would only sweat a tiny bit, and have the opportunity to freshen up. So I'll still use it to try out new fragrances, but I won't buy it again for a long time, and I won't wear it to work.",
