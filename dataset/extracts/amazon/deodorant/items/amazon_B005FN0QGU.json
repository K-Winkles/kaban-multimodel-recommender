                "reviewText": "This is a non-toxic anti-perspirant that actually works. The joke is that people who wear \"natural deoderant\" always smell bad, but I think this one is the exception rather than the rule.The key for me with this one vs. all the other \"natural\" options is that this one is actually an anti-perspirant and not just a deodorant. I personally can't stand the dripping sensation I get when wearing a standard deoderant, and I hate pit stains. This has neither. I apply this one time in the morning and then all day I literally never feel any moisture in my pits, no matter how hot and sweaty I get or how much exercise I do during the day.So then the question is does it actually block odors? I have had multiple friends and family smell me and they all say that I smell good and don't have any BO, and I can't smell it on myself, so I have to believe it really works.If I had any downsides I would say I don't love that it's unscented, because it just smells like...nothing. That might be a plus for you depending on your preferences. Also it's very wet and takes a bit of time to try out, so what I found is that if I apply it and then put my shirt on over top, I often will get some white residue on my shirt. I found the best way to apply is to put all my clothes on first, and then put this on under my clothes at that point.",

                "reviewText": "So I have tried so many natural deodorants. I started down this path back in September and now have gone through so many brands. Before deciding to go natural, I was the girl who always used clinical strength and man finding a natural one that does not irritate my skin and actually work has been a challenge. But I am so happy to say, THIS product worked on the first try, no irritations, and kept me smelling good over 24 hours (that has not been the case in ANY other brand). I first tried the Tom's brand as that was easily available and at the grocery store. Alas it did not last more than a couple hours before I started to smell my own BO. Then I tried Piper Was at the suggestion of my friend's blog (Gurl Gone Green). I was excited because it was said to also help not just with order but antiperspirant. This brand worked for me for about a week or so before my body rejected it and my pits began smelling almost like weed. Not during this process I was following all of the detox tips. I had been using a Aztec Secret - Indian Healing Clay - 1 lb. | Deep Pore Cleansing Facial & Healing Body Mask | The Original 100% Natural Calcium Bentonite Clay to help get the toxins out, using apple cider vinegar to get the PH back in balance and alas the search went on. I tried Freedom Brand next and honestly loved it. It seemed to work! But after a week I began developing a nasty red rash that did not go away so again the hunt continued. Next I tried Native deodorant. This was what I had been using for the last 3 months. And I had to go through a couple of scents, but it again seemed to work. My pits did develop a bit of a film and were kinda greasy but hey I didn't smell so I stuck it out....until one day my body decided...Nope I don't like it any more. Then I couldn't go more than 3-4 hours without again having a weed-like scent (no matter the scent I was using it all turned after 3-4 hours). So after hours of research I ran across this product and it was unlike so many I have tried. It was roll on and I will not lie, I was not sure what would happen. I have been using it a week now and LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. It does leave you a little wet if you don't have time to let it dry once you put it on, but it lasts such a long time. I am one SUPER happy customer!!!",

                "reviewText": "tl;dr: Worked great, but I developed armpit cysts. Not fun.I really liked this deodorant at first. It\u2019s rather pricey, and as others have mentioned in reviews, the bottle design is flawed, as a lot of deodorant accumulates on the bottle roller when applied. Also, it does cause a somewhat unsightly powdery residue when it dries.However, I liked the soft scent, and it actually worked at keeping me pretty odor-free all day. It even worked better than some antiperspirant deodorants I\u2019ve tried. I thought I had finally found my deodorant holy grail, and was planning on leaving a glowing review.But a few weeks into use I developed several large, painful cysts on my armpits. This has never happened before, and my deodorant was the only thing I changed. So, sadly it seems that my skin is reacting to one or more of the ingredients. I\u2019ll switch back to my old deodorant, and if the cysts go away I\u2019ll conclude that this stuff isn\u2019t for me.",

It also holds up during day to day activities. The only con is that it\u2019s a roll on deodorant, which isn\u2019t my preferred since it\u2019s wet when you put it on.

                "reviewText": "I must admit that I initially tried this product because a celebrity (Aubrey Plaza) said it really worked for her! It works incredibly well for me too! I do not sweat or experience any BO all day when using this product, nor do I get incredibly itchy armpits like I did with aluminum based deodorants. There are definitely cheaper options out there for ordering it online, and the scent could be greatly improved (which is why I gave 4* instead of 5*).",

                "reviewText": "After talking with a friend I found out that body odour is not caused by sweating itself, but by the bacteria on the surface of your skin reacting with sweat. Looking into it more I found out:Anti-persiperants work by effectively clogging pores in your armpits (with aluminium) to reduce your sweating and the amount of bacteria that interacts with it, which doesn't sound great, especially as its blocking a natural process for the body to get rid of toxins as well as cool down.Skin in the armpit is some of the thinest skin on the body, so ideal for absorptionWomen who are recovering from breast cancer are advised not to use under-arm care that contains alumimium (and parabens)The yellow stains I would eventually get on my work shirts are not baked in sweat, but traces of aluminium left over from the anti-perispreant.It's advisable to use underarm care before going to bed.Armed with this I did look around at a lot of natural deodorants that wouldn't block sweat and that did not contain alminium and parabens. After trying at least 10 different ones, which either ranged from being ineffective and left me smelling myself before the end of the day, or causing skin irritation under the arms I found this one which, is a revelation and works so well.It's not cheap, but so effective! Easily lasts the day and often well into the next day and very natural ingredients. The smell is not something I would normally chose, but is pleasant enough and a small price to pay for such effective under arm care.Highly recommended.P.S.My advice is once applied, use two fingers to rub it into the skin and let it dry before dressing.",

For $40 for a deodorant I thought it would be very good but my underarms are so itchy. Don't bother if you have any type of sensitive skin. If you react to baking soda, even though it isn't one of the ingredients listed, you will get the same skin reaction. It's too bad you can't return it, I won't make this mistake again.",
