I regret not buying it sooner. I have thrown away any other deodorant I had because this kind is the best I\u2019ve ever bought!! The \u201croll-on\u201d style is incredibly easy and efficient to use. Unlike most other deodorants, I can feel how much is going on since it has more of a liquid consistency, which is helpful for someone who never put on enough previously. The scent is fresh and light as I do not like scents that are too strong and overpowering. It also makes me feel good about what I\u2019m putting on my body since it is all natural. It has truly changed my life and made me so much more confident!! I rate this a full 5/5 with absolutely no reservations.",

I have tried so many others even Native and every one made me break out in a rash. I have been using this for years until it became hard to find which is when I had to switch. The cost of this is outrageous as I used to pay $3.50/bottle a couple of years ago. Now people are taking advantage of the \"high\" costs and inflating the price. I bought a few on Amazon but was able to find it cheaper elsewhere online. So if you look at this cost of $40 - that's $10 a bottle - Outrageous. But as for the product - it is incredible and works really well. If you have sensitive skin, this is a must. They also have another fragrance but did not like that one at all.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best Deodorant",
                "reviewText": "I wanted to switch to a healthier deodorant a long time before I found this one, due to reactions to general deodorants on the market. No other natural deodorants worked for me (or they irritated my skin too). This one works better than all others I have ever used, including mainstream. It not only does not cause me any irritation, it actually seems to soothe my skin (such as after shaving)It is a bit different to get used to non-mainstream deodorant if you haven't used it before. This one rolls on with a little roller, it is a liquid, it uses different compounds to do it's job than what you've used before. But it works.EFFECTIVENESS: If I sweat a lot - like an unusual amount of activity - this deodorant may need to be reapplied. This is one thing others may not like. It doesn't bother me, and I hardly ever have to reapply it anyway. This deodorant has even worked on reapplication after sweating (cutting odor after the fact). I exercise and am outside every day, so I have certainly tested this deodorant extensively. I have used it now for about two years, I believe.AMOUNT: It is a small roller, but even though there is a small amount per product, it lasts a really long time. It is 3 fl oz, so you can fly with your normal deodorant roller no problem. As it gets lower, you may have to turn it upside down to get the roller coated before application to not waste the last bit.SCENT: I love almonds, so the scent of \"Aloe and Almonds\" is great for me. It smells wonderful, and not too much in my face. Floral scents annoy me at best, and I don't wear perfume, so I loved that this deodorant has such a pleasant smell without over doing it. I don't care for the smell of the \"unscented\" version, but other people who have tried this deodorant tell me that they can't smell that one, so I may be smelling something they can't. Unscented kind of reminds me of the smell some unscented soaps have, so if you know what that smell is, that's what you'd get.It's only fair to say that some people I know who have tried this one say that it didn't work for them. Your body may not respond to it the same way. But this deodorant is completely worth a try.I would easily advise anybody to use this deodorant, even over the mainstream ones.",

Native is better than Lume, however, this deodorant blows all of them out of the water.I don\u2019t understand why my underarms have started to have a horrible odor that I can\u2019t stand because I never actually sweat\u2026but they have and it\u2019s probably a reaction to Lume.Well I put this deodorant to the ultimate test.My underarms were smelling so bad that I just went ahead and put this deodorant on over the smell\u2026to my amazement, the odor went away immediately.What ever is in this deodorant is some sort of bacteria killer that kills underarm bacteria on contact.I am still amazed at the effectiveness of this deodorantAfter reading the reviews, I ordered 6 containers of it. I never want to run out.It had a strong smell at first and then the smell disappeared \u2026probably because it had to gear up for the job it had to do underneath my arms.The price is great compared to many natural deodorants on the market that I doubt even comes close to being as effective as this one.I just can\u2019t get over the way it took the pungent under arm odor away immediately.If I could give it 100 stars, I would.",

Also, since I wear a lot of black, it is important to have a deodorant that does not leave white marks on my clothes. This is the only deodorant that works effectively, completely eliminating smell, not leaving any marks, and is natural. As a sidenote, I work out vigorously every day, running and doing all kinds of weightlifting and cardio, and it still holds up.",
