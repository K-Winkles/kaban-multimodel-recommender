When you need to keep your odor pinned down, deodorant is your first line of defense\u2026until you take a closer look. Peeking at the labels of big-brand body care can often induce high-pitched squealing. Sure, you may steam up like a zoo on a hot summer day, but you don\u2019t want to lather yourself in animal ingredients. The pigs don\u2019t deserve that \u2013 and neither do you! For odor-free protection, try Aloe Unscented Roll-On Deodorant from Alvera! This formula is designed to keep you dry and odor-free throughout the day while conditioning your skin. This deodorant also features whole oat protein, witch hazel, and grapefruit seed extract.",
