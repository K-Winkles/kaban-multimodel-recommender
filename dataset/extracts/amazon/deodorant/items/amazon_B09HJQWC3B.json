                "reviewText": "I just started using this product. It goes on dry which is nice. The fragrance lasted into the following day. It is described as a unisex fragrance, but to me smells more masculine than feminine. Kind of like a man\u2019s cologne. That\u2019s not to say women couldn\u2019t wear it though. The fragrance is tolerable. You will need an open area to use the spray, as it leaves a huge fragrance cloud that takes forever to dissipate. And you may need to hold your breath until the air clears. Overall, I prefer the spray to the roll-on which irritates my skin. But both get the job done.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I tried the Certain Dri spray. That stuff sucks. So, I saw this and decided to try it. I like it much better than their spray. This powder is fairly smooth. It's a bit heavier feeling than baby powder that I use. I've been having hot flashes really badly. So, the baby powder wasn't cutting it. This isn't the best. But, it helps more than baby powder. It usually lasts 24 hours. Sometimes, I have to apply it more often depending on how bad my hot flashes are. I use it under my breasts and under my belly fat. If you get any kind of rash, stop until it clears up. Baby powder doesn't bother me when I'm rashy. But, this powder makes it worse under my breast, and caused it to end up getting raw. It must be the different ingredients, like calamine. Baby powder doesn't have calamine in it. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It doesn't always help my sweating when I'm really bad. But, it's worth using since it helps more than other things I've tried. The Certain Dri spray just keeps me oily. It helps keep me from sweating. But, I'm still wet. So, it kinda defeats it's purpose. I'd even stay naked and use a hair dryer on myself after applying. It still stays oily, no matter how little I apply. I tried applying very little, but then I'd sweat. So, the spray just didn't work on me. I like the powder a lot better. As for the scent of the spray, I hate it. I smells like men's deodorant. The Certain Dri Powder is light, and is a scent a man or woman can wear. Plus, I can't smell it on myself after applying it. I can still smell the Certain Dri Spray on myself here and there after applying it, likely because its oily.",

I do need to apply this one a few times a day but it works and I can\u2019t smell myself anymore. It does smell like mens scent but it goes away after awhile.Update: this product is no longer working on me. I have to apply one other deodorant before the spray and I still smell hours later.",

                "reviewText": "In four attempts to use this product, the canisters all failed to dispense most of the contents. The aerosol valves each clogged, and only the gas was able to leave each canister. I tried every means of opening the flow of product (rinsed cap with warm water, shook and inverted the can, blew air through the nozzles, twisted the caps to ensure they were aligned).In calling for help, I was offered only digital credits, and the process of inquiring about a refund was very slow and tedious. The call took a very long time and it felt designed to dissuade you from proceeding with a refund request.I have the cans but will not likely photograph each, scan and send images and complete forms for a refund. Also, the call I made to report my issue was dropped several times, and wait times were very long when I attempted to call again. When I reached a representative, that agent asked each question several times and struggled to acknowledge or reply coherently to my issue.The consumer experience overall was poor. I\u2019m disappointed because I felt the product worked well, but the engineering of the dispenser failed each of four attempts to use it. It\u2019s a shame.",

                "reviewText": "I have never purchased a spray deodorant before, but I wanted to try this as the ratings and popularity were high up there in the ranks. Also, I can't see all that great with my \"over 40\" eyes....a lot gets missed. So this spray deodorant will not come out of the can until you twist the cap a bit. It's like a locking mechanism for those who are new to US deodorant in a spray form. (I only thought they did this with pumping bottles like lotion or shampoo) The scent is gender neutral and could work for anyone at any age.The product is a wet spray, but dries quickly without leaving a sticky feeling. The can feels full, much different than other sprays I have bought the international version of.If you are concerned about deodorants staining your clothes, not a concern here. That was one of the main reasons I went searching and found myself here....the residue left on clothes from stick deodorants.The active ingredient is Aluminum Chlorohydrate and it is the highest I have seen at 25%.",
