It doesn\u2019t leave residue like some do when you\u2019re showering and it\u2019s like you\u2019ve put tar under your arms. It doesn\u2019t crumble and have a weird texture like some deodorants on the more natural side have.I\u2019m very pleased with this purchase. I was unsure and wary of having to try yet another deodorant in case I disliked it, but this one is exactly what I was looking for.My only qualm is that there\u2019s no plastic free version of the container, but then again the price point for this three back would be higher if there were a zero-plastic option. I\u2019d have to see what the difference would be. But I\u2019m all for more sustainably packaged deodorants.",

However, like how some reviewers have stated, this has a strong lemon smell, nothing mountain spring-like imo. I don't have an issue with this honestly but it definitely wasn't expected when the scent was advertised as \"Mountain Spring.\" As for the longevity, it definitely didn't last 24 hours as claimed. Maybe 8-10 hours at most and definitely less if you're being more active. All in all, not too bad but I wouldn't buy this deo unless it was on sale. I believe it was 3 for $15 at the time at purchase and I thought it was definitely worth it at that price point.",

I\u2019ve tried a few others. Wish it was cheaper and had a wider range for men on the Amazon store. This deodorant is less than half the price in the US. Will have to pay the premium for now before travelling again.",
