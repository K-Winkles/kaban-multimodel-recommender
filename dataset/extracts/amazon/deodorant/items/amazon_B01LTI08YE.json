                "reviewText": "I looked for a deodorant for about 8 months. I was a fan of native especially the cool scents but not the price or the fact it gave me a horrible itchy rash or the fact that it balled up constantly and created those disgusting deodorant balls. It\u2019s supposed to be natural yet gave me symptoms of what you would think chemicals would do. I am super finicky about smells. I absolutely hate that secret fresh powder or floral smell. It makes me gag. Uh. Arm and hammer was a weird consistency and I have long days where I leave at 7 am and don\u2019t get home till 10 pm. I hate having to put deodorant on 2 times a day or more. I tried about 15 other ones so I\u2019ll spare you those deets. LOOK NO FURTHER. This deodorant is #1 best I tried out of everything. Works so good and I only have to apply it once and it lasts all day with absolutely no sign of B.O. The consistency weirded me out because I had never used the soft invisible solid kind you have to pump up, but omg I also absolutely hate deodorant balls! \ud83e\udd22 That\u2019s never happened with this deodorant! I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am to finally find one that works so good and checks all the boxes. The smell of this one has grown on me and I absolutely love this product. Sorry for the novel but if you knew how much time and money I spent trying to find a good one, then you would understand the passion and excitement around this review! 10 STARS!",

                "reviewText": "I love this deodorant! Some things to note- I am quite smell-sensitive, and am picky about my personal scents.I also have overactive adrenal glands(I sweat a lot) after some head/brain injuries, and BEFORE finding Secret Clinical Strength Line of Soft Solids, I had felt like I was always wanting/needing to reapply deodorant midday. (I have tried the \u201cClinical\u201d lines of Dove, Mitchum, Degree, etc. and none was as good as Secret overall, with scent, comfort, and efficacy.)I only use this brand/line now, and I\u2019ve used many of the different scents- THIS stress response citrus is my absolute fave!The scent is light and fresh, not overpowering but enough to help a lady not smell like body odor-armpit sweat, even after a good workout! I work out at least 3 times a week, and after a shower I don\u2019t feel like I have to reapply deodorant with this line (I use 1 to 2 clicks on clean underarms, & I\u2019m good to go). This soft solid is also moisturizing, and soothing after I shave my underarms.I\u2019d totally recommend this product, it\u2019s my go-to antiperspirant and deodorant!*This is all my own opinion and I was NOT given any free or discounted stuff to write a review. I rely a lot on detailed reviews for products I buy, so I\u2019m just trying to return the favor!",

                "reviewText": "I love the stress response soft solid, it smells really good and it works all day long. But I didn't get the right product this time. I got free & sensitive which has no scent. Not sure if it works bc I've never used it. I'm extremely unhappy bc it's not what I bought & I could have got this un-scented stuff at Walmart for cheaper! The stress response is harder to find bc it's always sold out!",

                "reviewText": "This is, by far, the best nonprescription deodorant and antiperspirant I have ever used. It\u2019s also the cleanest/best/freshest smelling! It truly works for the amount of time it says it will and doesn\u2019t irritate my skin. Also, it doesn\u2019t cake or gunk up in your creases and it doesn\u2019t leave the oil spots or stains in your clothing. I\u2019m very particular about how my deodorants smell, and this truly is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of scents. I can\u2019t do powder or shower clean because my brain instantly associates both scents with body odor and it makes me ridiculously anxious.. This has a light & fresh floral scent that doesn\u2019t smell like deodorant so you don\u2019t have to fear that you\u2019re wafting it into anyone\u2019s face. I\u2019m a nervous and active sweater and this controls both. I LOVE the stress response feature. Do yourself a solid(or whichever formula you prefer) and order this product today!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this stuff for years, but generally gravitate toward the light and fresh scent. I tried the stress response this time around and, though a bit stronger, I very much enjoy the scent.I love this deodorant because it lasts all day, literally, and actually works. When I was younger, I had a problem with excessive sweating; as a result, though no longer a sweaty teenager, I fear the pit stains. With this product, I fear being a sweaty Betty no more!Lastly, my skin is ridiculously sensitive when it comes to shaving. Some deodorants irritate my skin even further, but not Secret Clinical Strength: It glides I\u2019m easily and smoothly, and moisturizes my skin. My armpits no longer get razor bumps when applying deodorant.In summary, if you\u2019re really good at sweating, prone to skin irritations, and in the market for a long-lasting deodorant that only needs to be applied once a day, then I highly recommend this product. (Added bonus: it\u2019s way cheaper on Amazon than in stores).",
