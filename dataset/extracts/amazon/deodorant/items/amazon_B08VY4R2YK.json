                "reviewText": "There are two things I like about this product:1) It is very effective over a multi-day period. It may take more than one application before you achieve multi-day protection. Once done, even showers will not reduce effectiveness2) it is also suitable for the male \"nether regions\". It is scent free and it does not use alcohol as a carrier solvent. This is particularly important for sensitive skin.It is important to apply this product and other similar products in the evening, prior to bed rest as this allows the product to soak into the sweat glands before being washed away with the sweat or a shower.",

                "reviewText": "First off the scent is not masculine. It has a fruity, mango scent which even my wife thought was meant for her and even she didn't like the scent at all. Neither did I.Second the image is false advertisement and should be updated - This is not a pack of 2 deodorants. It only comes with one as you can see with the associated image.I'm a male that weighs around 230 lbs and wore this for a day, went to work, and went to the gym. I wreaked worst than if I wore a \"natural\" deodorant with no parabens etc... or if I would've worn nothing at all. This did not keep me smelling good throughout the day and even interfered with how I smelt after I took a shower and tried to re-apply a different deodorant.Hands down one of the worst deodorants I've ever tried and will not be purchasing again in the future. If you're a male I suggest you take this as a warning and stay away.",
