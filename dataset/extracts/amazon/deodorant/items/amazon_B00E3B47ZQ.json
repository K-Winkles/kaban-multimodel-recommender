                "reviewText": "Because Mom kept an open box of Arm & Hammer Baking Soda in the fridge to neutralize odors, I thought a baking soda deodorant might also neutralize (not just mask). And it's true: At least for my sensitive skin, Arm & Hammer deodorant is the most efficacious nature-derived, non-antiperspirant deodorant I've found.This is a clear stick that goes on clear -- no chalky white film residue on armpits or clothes, no wetness. Attractively, its label advertising, \"Unscented - No Added Fragrance\" is a touch inaccurate: While it's true it lists none of the \"Fragrance\" or \"Parfum\" that so often wreaks havoc on sensitive skin, it does have a mild, uplifting scent reflecting the fruit and flower oils noted in the ingredients.This one fights off stink and goes the distance. Great efficacy and a great value, particularly in this 4-pack offering. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking \"Helpful.\" Cheers!)",

                "reviewText": "As an avid bicyclist, I am quite used to sweating. I found my old deodorant/antiperspirant to be uncomfortable, obstructing sweating in my underarms and occasionally causing sweat glands to inflame.I also found that I needed to use the deodorant/antiperspirant consistently, and when I forgot or chose not to use it due to inflamed glands I would be quite pungent by the end of the day. There are recent studies showing that use of antiperspirant can actually increase pungency of sweat odor, and I certainly could be a case study.I don't subscribe to the idea that aluminum or parabens are bad for your health, and there's little evidence to back such a claim. I changed because I wanted to get away from using antiperspirant due to how it made me feel. This deodorant does not include antiperspirant, and my underarms feel better for it.Where I used to be pretty pungent 24 hours after application, use of the Arm & Hammer Essentials Deodorant has virtually eliminated underarm odor 24 hours later. Even better, I can go a day without deodorant and not be self-conscious that I'm leaving a trail of odor behind me.What I Really Like:- Underarms feel very clear, open, fresh. Underarms sweat as they should during exercise, and I don't have problems with inflamed sweat glands anymore.- Underarms feel clean after washing - no residue from antiperspirant.- Very little odor even 24 hours later, and very little odor after exercising.- Underarm odor is much more natural, much less pungent when it does appear.- Doesn't leave stains on clothes when it comes contact with them. I don't have to be nearly as careful to avoid letting my clothes hit my underarms getting dressed.I'd give it 5 stars except for these two things:- Despite being \"unscented\", this product smells like a combination Froot Loops cereal and Citronella candles. It's not at all offensive, but it's also not the scent you'd expect from a man. I'm not sure I'd prefer a more woody (Cedar or Sandlewood, perhaps) overtone, but the first few hours each morning makes me think of breakfast as a kid.- There's a tingling in the underarms for a couple hours after application. This is likely the alcohol slowly evaporating, but it can get a little itchy.I'm quite happy with this product, and will continue to get it - at least until someone offers a more \"masculine\" deodorant option.",

                "reviewText": "I sweat a lot, and I have very sensitive skin. This is the only deodorant that's ever worked for me.At first it smells faintly like celery seed, but in a pleasant, nondistracting way (the old unscented formula smelled more like geranium, which was nicer but a little more pronounced). After a while, that hint of aroma fades, and by the end of the day, my pits smell like\u2026 nothing. Not like the acidic odor of sweat, not like some cloying artificial fragrance\u2014just like the default scent of my body when it's reasonably clean. Someone could bury their face in your pits, if you're into that, and feel like they're smelling your natural scent, but you also wouldn't be reeking of pheromones like someone wearing no deodorant at all. It's also never caused any redness or irritation on my very sensitive skin, and it's cheaper than most drugstore deodorants.I don't write many product reviews, and I had to write one just to sing this deodorant's praises.",
