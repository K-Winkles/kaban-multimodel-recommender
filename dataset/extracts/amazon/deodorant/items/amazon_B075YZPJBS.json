It\u2019s nice that most vegans don\u2019t suffer from hyperhidrosis and can elect to only use deodorants to mask odor and do nothing about sweat (and then health shame anyone who doesn\u2019t). Unfortunately, I\u2019m not among them. I need something to stop the sweating, but I don\u2019t want animals suffering in the process. This stuff is LITERALLY the only vegan antiperspirant that\u2019s out there. And not only does it smell great and soothe my underarms after shaving, but it also stops my profuse and embarrassing sweating in its tracks. I\u2019m kinda an odorless sweater somehow so I can\u2019t tell you how well it works on that, but for my primary needs (1) vegan and 2) stop the sweat), it\u2019s absolutely perfect. Tom\u2019s, please never stop making this product!",
