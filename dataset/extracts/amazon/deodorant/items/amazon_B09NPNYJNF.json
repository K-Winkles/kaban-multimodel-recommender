I am a very active man and it definitely protects. However the white often stains my shirts as I putting them on. Also and this is just personal, I love a very strong cedar, musk scent and while I like Swagger its not exactly what I want. On top of that once I am out I notice that the scent disappears. I wish it would last longer. Its a good product for men. It is a strong protector.",
