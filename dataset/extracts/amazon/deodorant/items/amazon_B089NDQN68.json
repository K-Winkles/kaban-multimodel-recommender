                "reviewText": "I've tried many aluminum-free deodorants and for the most part, they don't work very well but there are a few exceptions. Here are the ones I've tried and how I liked them in rank order:Winners - These work great for body odor:#1 - Dove - winner by a long shot - works and applies like regular deodorant. All-weather long-lasting protection. This is so good that I can hardly believe it's aluminum-free. Fairly priced too.#2 - Lume - works very well but, applies like a sticky lotion. It's also pretty pricy.#3 - Crystal Mineral Deodorant Stone - This one always made me nervous because it never really applied and product to my skin. It worked well for quite a while and then seemed to stop. Not sure it the minerals in the stone were depleted or if it just stopped working for me. More testing would be required with a new stick.Medium - Will do in a pinch - Works moderately well on body odor, but not as well as a regular deodorant. I'm hesitant to use these during the summer.#3 - UnderArmed - Seems to work moderately well. A little waxy in texture but otherwise applies like normal deodorant.#4 - Schmidt's Natural Deodorant - comes in a 2 oz jar that is applied like lotion - didn't care for application and only works moderately well on body odor.#5 - Jason - applies like normal deodorant but doesn't really do the job on body odor for very long.SUCKS - Waste of money and doesn't work at all#6 Secret - Applies like normal deodorant but has almost no impact on body odor. I was stinky by the end of a cool day after working in an air-conditioned office and only walking from the office to my car (10 feet from the front door). I can't imagine using this at the gym or during the summer.",

Here's a straightforward review:Pros:- Odor Protection: This deodorant offers effective 24-hour odor protection, even on busy days.- Scent: The coconut and pink jasmine scent is pleasant without being overwhelming.- Non-Sticky: It goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and doesn't leave a sticky residue.- Skin-Friendly: It's gentle on sensitive skin and hasn't caused any irritation.One minor issue:- Cap: The cap can be a bit tricky to put back on securely.Overall, if you're looking for an aluminum-free deodorant that does its job well and has a nice scent, this Dove product is worth considering.",

Go with caution friends bc have noticed certain items claim to have no ALUMINUM but do ! Always read the list of ingredients . Thanks Amazon for packaging my items so well ! Really appreciate it ! Recently complained bc a box of tea, for a gift came smashed up completely! Not ok. Delivery people are now also ringing my apartment doorbell. 1 thing left ,wish they'd stop just tossing the packages , I hear them doing this. But lots of improvements & thanks again Amazon , fast delivery !",
