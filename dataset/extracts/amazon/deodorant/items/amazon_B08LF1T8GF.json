                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Yeah it's a little difficult to apply",
                "reviewText": "It's a little difficult to apply, but that's because we might be a little impatient. The directions say to warm it up in your pits by holding the deodorant in there for a few seconds, essentially, before swiping it around. That does help. It is still a bit resistant to apply, but to be honest, I think a little goes a long way. You don't need a thick coat for this stuff to work.On to my review and why I am giving this 5 stars despite the resistance. I've been using Native for 5 years and I don't know if the formula changed, or my body chemistry, but it just stopped working for me. So I've been on the hunt for a new aluminum free deodorant. I've tried so many deodorants in the past few weeks. Highly rated Mitchum, Old Spice, Speed Stick, etc. I must have tried 6 different deodorants before trying this one. Yes, I read all the reviews and took notice of the reviews about how difficult it is to apply. I tried it anyway and I'm glad I did. ALL of those *other* deodorants I tried did not keep my body odor away. After a few hours I'd find myself smelling like Old Spice and BO. Always BO by the end of the day.This Dr. Teals is the only deodorant that has not given up on me by the end of the day. I notice I'm not as sweaty too, even though this is not an antiperspirant. The scent of this stuff is nice. It's very light and slightly sweet, but not a sickly sweet scent. I think another review mentioned smelling like play dough, I'd say play dough mixed with vanilla. But not in a bad way. It's pleasant, and hey, maybe even nostalgic if it brings you back to your play dough days. I can't complain because it's better than BO. I'm happy to have found this stuff and might see if Dr. Teals has other scents available to try. The formula works very well for me. I'd say if you have the patience, try this stuff out and you might see that it works for you too.",

                "reviewText": "This stuff works great. It\u2019s not the easiest to apply as the stick is kind of hard, so you have to let the stick warm up and then work to apply it very generously. I sang its praises to my wife, who uses Secret, and she tried it for a while, but she said it didn\u2019t work for her. The problem is that she tried to use it like Secret gel, just a quick zip-zip under the arms. With this stuff you really want to coat it on there, and it takes a little effort, going over the entire underarm and then going over it again. The up side to the hardness of the stick is that it lasts a long time. I don\u2019t mean the odor protection, although that does last a long time, but the stick itself. Even though it feels like you\u2019re using a lot of it, you\u2019re not really, and I can make a stick last a month. I\u2019ve tried other similar magnesium-based deodorants, like Crystal and Dr. Squatch. They\u2019re softer and easy to apply, but they\u2019re also nearly twice as expensive and the stick lasts less than half as long, probably about 10 days. Crystal didn\u2019t work very well at all (it didn\u2019t help that the scent itself smelled kind of like B.O.), but Dr. Squatch worked at least as well as Dr. Teal\u2019s. The problem again with Dr. Squatch is cost and that the stick depletes too quickly. Dr. Teal\u2019s is the one for me.",

I didn\u2019t have an issue with odor while using this, so that\u2019s good. The smell wasn\u2019t overwhelming or so strong that it overpowered any fragrance I used. It\u2019s not the worst deodorant I\u2019ve used, but I won\u2019t be purchasing again.",
