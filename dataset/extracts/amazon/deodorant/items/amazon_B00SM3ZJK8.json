I chose Ban unscented roll-on after doing some research at EWG website, as I try to reduce chemicals that I consume and apply to my skin. I want to reduce hazardous chemicals in personal care and cleaning products, but I also do not want to spend a ton of money on products that are so natural they barely work. A little chemistry is needed here. And I'm totally willing to spend a few minutes waiting for my roll-on to dry as a trade-off for reasonable price. At first I couldnt believe it this roll-on would work, and was just going to use it when I'm not going anywhere - but it works fine! I havent noticed any stains or any effect on my clothes, I'm wondering if it's less likely to affect clothes because it doesnt have whatever chemicals are needed to make it a solid. That would be nice.",
