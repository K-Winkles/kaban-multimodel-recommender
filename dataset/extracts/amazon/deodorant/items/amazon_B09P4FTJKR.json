Within 6 hours on a normal day I could catch a sniff of \u201cnot fresh,\u201d and if I had a workout or strenuous work to do, there was no chance of coming out of it with my arms raised high in celebration.Smells pleasant on application, but, at least with my body chemistry, it didn\u2019t seem to work.",

                "reviewText": "I like to smell good and I don't mind spending an extra few dollars to do so. So, when I stumbled across this Every Man Jack \"EMJ\" product, I was intrigued. But with a price tag nearly twice the amount of standard deodorant, my expectations were high.Upon receiving my package, my initial impression was positive. The two deodorant sticks were large and smelled amazing. The smell is much more like a \"cologne\" rather than an \"Axe-Spray'; like you'd find with a regular deodorant. I really do like the smell a lot! However, the smell of the stick may very well be the only positive carrying this product.The issues first arise if you try and put this product on after a shower. If you are not bone-dry when you put it on under your armpits, it will begin to foam and cover your whole armpits in a white foamy substance.Then there is the longevity of the smell. Unfortunately, this product just doesn't last very long. I find that I have to apply this twice a day, whereas I'm used to only putting my underarm deodorant on once and then smelling fresh all day.Lastly, it seems that I developed some sort of reaction to the product. After about two months of use, my armpits began rashing up every time I put this on. I can't say that will happen to everyone, but I happened to myself and hasn't occurred with any other deoderant.Like the title states, I really did want to love this product. A new kind of smell in the deodorant world would be amazing! Unfortunately, this just misses the mark...",
