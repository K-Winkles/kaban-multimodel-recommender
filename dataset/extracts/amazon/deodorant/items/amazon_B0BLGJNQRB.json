We try to take the more natural route which doesn't always work as well, however this one is a 10/10 for me. I read a lot of reviews where they say the texture is gritty or melted, or even like \"rubbing a rock under your armipt\", but this didnt seem to have either of those textures. Maybe some bad batches? It arrived yesterday, and I put it on after I took my shower. I did do a lot of running around and cooking and baking and I'm honestly a little surprised as to how I do not smell even a little bit. I was using the coconut scented one before this, and I realized after a few hours, it didn't hold up aswell, but the sparkling peach is holding up very well. This one will be my go to from now on. The only thing I was disappointed about was that it didn't smell like much of anything, a very light hint of peach after you rubbed off the first layer, but I'd rather not smell like anything than a sweaty b.o. peach soup. Ew. Thanks for a great product!",

                "reviewText": "Firstly the smell is great but it\u2019s not a obvious peach smell and it doesn\u2019t have a big scent when you put it on so you do not radiate peach smell, unlike regular dove deodorant that will smell strong if you sweat. The hello deodorant is so so weird and has a chunky texture. If you put it on after a while it will rub together and it will for balls of waxy deodorant. I hate the texture as you can see in the picture it\u2019s chunky and stays as a solid on your skin. The deodorant also leaks out of the stick like the picture shows. I also left it on my desk and it leaked a whole puddle of oil when it is not hot in my area it never goes above 80 degrees here unless it\u2019s summertime. I really like the packaging though it is very cute and I wanted to like this because I love peachy scents but this is just not good. Gross and disgusting texture I will be going back to regular dove deodorant. Either I got a bad batch or it\u2019s badly formulated natural deodorant. Don\u2019t waste your money on this if you don\u2019t want the odds of getting chunky deodorant.",

I\u2019m not easy to must but after just an hour the fruity smell vanishes then 30 mins later them arms get a little twangy lol. I\u2019ll keep searching:(",

                "reviewText": "I used to use Native peach deodorant spray, but it didn\u2019t last longer than 2 hours. I looked online for chemical-free deodorants and found this one. Peach scent is honestly my favorite, so I gave this one a try and I really love it! It actually smells like a good deodorant without harmful ingredients, and it lasts me all day, into the next day. I also have really sensitive skin and this doesn\u2019t irritate me or dry me out at all. I definitely recommend! I\u2019ve been using it for a month now and I think it\u2019s safe to say I really love this and would definitely recommend to others trying to find hygiene products without harmful chemicals.",
