                "reviewText": "Like others here, I have very sensitive skin. Most deodorants turn my armpits a dark color in addition to irritating the skin. Often making my pits extremely itchy and red after a few weeks of use. This would happen with many natural deodorants too, since the concentrated essential oils were often too strong.I was previously using Lume antibacterial deodorant, which didn't darken or irritate my skin. It also worked decently well at keeping away BO. But the deodorant itself also had a bit of a strange odor underlying it. And I was getting paranoid about contributing to antibacterial resistance.So I decided to switch back to a more traditional stick deodorant. This arm and hammer deodorant smells good, and lasts like a regular deodorant, as far as I can tell.I would say it will reliably covers any sweat and BO in the applied areas for up to 24 hours. It lasted through me working on my truck for about 4 hours in 80-90 degree weather, and I was sweating pretty heavily at times.Also lasts through my work day and then some, I'm usually logging a minimum of 10,000-15,000 steps between uses.It does turn my armpits a bit dark, but so far no irritation after a couple months use.Pros:-Works for me! 24 hours of moderate/lightly active movement.-No irritation.-Smells good.-Goes on clear, turns white, then goes clear again.Cons:-Darkens armpit skin.-Doesn't really smell like coconut per se, just flowery with a hint of vague *tropical* scent.-It does turn white for a bit while adjusting to body temp, may affect your clothes.If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try applying a bit more than usual and see how it goes. Hope this helps!",
