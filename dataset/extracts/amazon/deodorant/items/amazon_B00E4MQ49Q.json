                "reviewText": "I use a spray of Arrid extra dry on other body parts besides under arms as it keeps me comfortable, fresh well over 24 hours if I find myself having to go that long between shower. This product works very well and does not irritate my skin and I'm sensitive to many skin products, I have actually pushed it up to 72+ hours of use but not on a regular basis but if as example, camping in the woods without a shower for the weekend in a humid area your tent mate will thank you for using this product but don't make the mistake of letting your friends know you have a can as this stuff is like gold if you are in a group and can't get to a shower in a hot area.The clean scent is not over powering and I don't like heavy scented products and scents actually bother me but this smell is fine but I do with Arrid would bring back the unscented version but this is okay. I am having more and more problems finding this \"yellow can \" locally and I don't like the blue can Arrid so happy I can buy the yellow can version in a multi pack so I will always have on hand. A can of this stuff goes a long, long way and will last a long time and a good value. I find I must always have a can around to feel cool and clean and DRY... Good Stuff! I can no longer find the yellow can in a store local so happy Amazon has it in stock!",
