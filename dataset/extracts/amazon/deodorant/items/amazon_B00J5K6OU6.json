                "reviewText": "I've used this Crystal Deodorant for many years (about 20), but NEVER purchased it from Amazon before. After using one of them for about a week I noticed my armpits burning and itching and also felt it wasn't helping the smell much. This has NEVER happened before using this one. I don't think the one I bought here on Amazon is the 'real' one ... or maybe I got some from a bad batch? I went to Whole Foods today and bought 2 from there and the labels are a different color than the ones I received here from Amazon. I noticed the one from Amazon (here) said ingredients were: Ammonium Alum and the one I bought from WF/s ingredient is: Potassium Alum. From looking it up it says the the former AA is synthetic and the Potassium Alum is natural and doesn't have the stinging effect. Needless to say I won't be buying The Crystal deoderant from Amazon again! I've passed the 'return' window, so I'm out of luck ... :(",

                "reviewText": "These are definitely traveled sized. I really prefer the container to the standard \"screw up/screw down\" container as those get stuck and break. If they would make the standard size deodorant in this container, it would be perfect. These are difficult to apply, they are so small. They are smaller than a D size battery but slightly larger than a C, making it difficult to hold onto and use without dropping it. I have small hands too, so I imagine it would be worse for someone with big hands.The container is way better than the standard size though, which is why I bought these. The lid fits over the deodorant that is attached to a base, rather than the deodorant screwing up and down. This is preferable because if you have used the standard size before, you know that in very short order, the crystal has dissolved in ways that prevent it from screwing up and down. I wind up leaving mine screwed all the way out and just set it upside down in the lid, leaned against the edge of the counter, to drain and dry. Not at all convenient and you get \"crusties\" that develop from dissolved crystal pooling at the tip of the deodorant. Scratchy!If these were just a little bigger, they would be awesome. At the end of the day, they are what is described: travel size.If you have never used crystal deodorant before, it is NOT antiperspirant. If you are a heavy sweater, you are still going to sweat. However, I have used this deodorant for several years now and I find that my arm pits do not sweat nearly as much as they used to, even with the antiperspirants. I'm not going to pretend to know the logistics of that as many people on Amazon have lots of theories about why that is. I don't think this will necessarily apply to everyone as we all sweat different. It's definitely not going to keep you from sweating, regardless. I believe I have an allergy to something in standard deodorant/antiperspirants, as my armpits would get very itchy and actually break out from time to time. I have never had that happen with this, although I did have the same itchy/breakout reaction to many (and I tried a lot) natural baking soda based deodorants. And I still stunk with those as well. I have also noted that since my clothing no longer carries the residue of deodorants past, like with the standard antiperspirants, that even if I sweat, it doesn't stink. I love that my clothes don't get ruined. If my pits get a little wet, I'm just not waving my arms above my head in public. This does have alum in it, as you can tell from how it sounds, that's a type of aluminum. Whether it's safe or not, is up to you to decide. I am going with how my armpits reacted to standard deodorant/antiperspirant combos and the baking soda based \"natural\" deodorants I tried. For me, this is the best option I have found.",
