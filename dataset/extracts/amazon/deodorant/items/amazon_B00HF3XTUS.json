I love the clear gel formula. It dries quickly and doesn't leave any residue or white marks on my bra. The scent is light and clean and doesn't have a heavy, chemical or soapy smell. Feels great on the skin. Can apply to recently shaven underarms with no sting. It's a little pricey for a stick of deoderant but you get your money's worth. It is everything you want in a heavy duty deodorant. Yes, the the Clinical Strength works better than the Outlast version of Secret by far.",

I stayed away from this bc of the price, but once I tried, I can't deny - IT'S THE BEST. I use the COMPLETELY CLEAN, 48-hour CLEAR GEL - about half a turn of product is enough and then wait about 2 min before getting dressed on top. NO RESIDUE! NO WET STAIN! NO ODOR! TRY IT! Oh, BTW, I live in S. FLA where it's hot, hotter, hottest and the humidity is 10000%. Still, TRY IT!",

                "reviewText": "This is my very favorite deodorant/anti-persperant! Some women are very lucky and they don't perspire as much as I do. I certainly wish I was one of those women! It seems like I have tried every deoderant and antiperspirant on the market. For awhile, I even tried going with the green deodeeants that are made from coconut oil that are supposed to be healthier for you because they are deoderant only, and don't contain any aluminum, however, honestly they not only made me sweat so much more, but they actually made me smell worse. So it is back to Secret Clinical for me, for life. I love that this antiperspirant is available in large sizes for such a great price. I have very sensitive skin, but Secret Clinical never irritates my sensitive skin in the slightest, even right after I shave. You use Secret Clinical at night just before bed, and it will protect you all throughout each day, no matter how long, active or busy your day happens to be. Secret Clinical comes in many scents, but my favorite is Completely Clean, which smells really nice, but isn't overwhelming and doesn't clash with the Davidoff Cool Water Eau De Toilette scent that I wear daily. Secret Clinical does say that it doesn't mark your clothes, however this is where I would caution other buyers. It is not totally unmarking, it will simply mark your clothes less than other solid deoderants. If you make the mistake of letting your shirt slide into your armpit while dressing, you will see some marking on your shirt afterward. I did speak to Secret Regarding this and they stated it was supposed to be an unmarking clear gel. When I advisee that it had marked several of my shirts, they reimbursed me by giving me a free antiperspirant. This is still my favorite antiperspirant, I'm simply more careful to ensure that I keep my shirts entirely out of my armpit while dressing so that there are no white marks on my clothes. Without this product I experience a great deal more perspiration and sometimes sweat rings on my clothes, to my great embarassment! With this product, I sweat so much less, never worry about odor or sweat marks on my clothing. Thank you Secret Clinical, you are a true lifesaver!",
