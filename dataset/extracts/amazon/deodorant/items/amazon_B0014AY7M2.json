                "reviewText": "I just love this deoderant. I have tried just about every natural deoderant product out there - from the items offered at the grocery stores to designer items handcrafted and purchased off the internet. This item was recommended to me by a friend over dinner, believe it or not, as we discussed potential links to antiperspirant ingrediants and disease. She said she had purchased it at a local grocery store in their \"organic\" section and, although it has a stronger scent at first, it is both effective and does not leave a rash. The smell is quite \"flowery\" and maybe a little overpowering at first but quickly goes away after a while and mellows out into a wonderful, soft almond scent. Best thing of all - it WORKS. I had problems with other natural deoderants - something in them caused me to get a sore rash under my arms. Other brands that I tried purchasing offline were ineffective or just too expensive! This was my miracle product. I have most of my friends and family using it now! I was happy to find it available online to order, since the stores don't always stock it. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to make the switch to a natural deoderant product.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this brand for about a year now and still think it's great. I've used Nature's Gate, Tom's, Hugo Naturals, Crystal products, Kiss My Face, Naturally Fresh and homemade aloe/powder solutions and this one is still the best choice for me. I apply once in the morning and it works all day (I work at a desk and commute about 10 blocks to and from work).If I am going to the gym to work out (3-5 mile run), I find that I do need to wear a t-shirt that will soak up sweat, otherwise, I will have irritation on the underarms from the skin friction. Since this deodorant doesn't \"cake-on\" it will be hard to try and swim/sweat and still expect coverage. In those cases, I just reapply. It's small enough to carry around in my bag. I do find, though, that you have to wipe off the cap area after you close it because since it's liquid, it tends to smear a bit once I screw the cap on after applying. That's a slight annoyance. Other than that, I love how easily it's removed in the shower (hated those secret brands) and it hasn't irritated or changed the color of my skin. One bottle lasts me about a month and needless to say, I'm about 12 bottles in! Ideally, I would find one with no chemicals of any kind (as I've read this has some), otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars. I'm not actively searching for another one, though, since this has worked so well for me.",

Most natural deodorants don\u2019t last long and you need to reapply frequently , the ones that last have toxic ingredients, I have tried several brands that didn\u2019t work. Lumeand this one have worked the best for me. Will certainly order more",
