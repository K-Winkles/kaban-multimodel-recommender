In purchasing two Powder scent ones recently, I realized they did something differently for the scent, but still called it Powder. I hated the new scent and it gave me a headache. So then I decided to try the one that says FRESH and love it!! It is light and not overpowering and very pleasant!!! So now I bought a backup of the one marked Fresh and will stick to that!!! Don't buy the one that says Powder because it's overpowering and smells yuk.... the one that says Fresh is lovely!!!!",

                "reviewText": "I am not one to perspire heavily or often but I always wear antiperspirant/deodorant to be sure I never end up with wet stains under my arms or smelling like sweat. Yuck! I generally like clear solids but this Suave antiperspirant was only $1.39 as an add on so I ordered it. It is a white solid that is cranked up by twisting the bottom until the stick reaches the desired level. It smells great. Not like powder which I don't like but like something very slightly floral and fresh.The stick is really silky and doesn't sting even if I use it right after I shave my armpits. It doesn't leave a white residue under my arms but it will leave white marks on dark clothing if I am not careful to avoid letting the fabric come in contact with the antiperspirant when getting dressed. Once I am dressed, I have not noticed any white marks on my clothes. The marks from dressing do come off easily with a damp cloth. For my needs, this product works fine. I haven't had any issues with perspiring even when working out hard. I think, if you are one who perspires heavily, this may not do the trick completely but, if you're like me and just need something to protect you from the occasional perspiration that comes from stress, heat, or during exercise, you'll find this Suave product works as well as pricier brands. I removed a star because it can leave white marks on clothing. I still prefer clear solids but certainly will use this stick and, depending on how effective it is over the long haul, will repurchase it when needed.",

Now the price, even for a pack of six, is $2.70 apiece.I go to my local Walmart only twice a year, given that \"local\" means 35 miles in this case and the destination is, after all, a Walmart supercenter. If the convenience of buying at Amazon suits you, so be it. But I have put this on my list for the next semi-annual trip to the supercenter, where this deodorant costs $1.83. (I checked the inventory and price on the Internet for this particular store.)I understand inflation, but it seems it would affect all retailers more evenly than this.",
