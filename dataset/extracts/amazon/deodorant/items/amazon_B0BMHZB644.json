This 6-pack offers a delightful range of scents that cater to different preferences, ensuring a fresh feeling throughout the day. The 150 ML size is generously ample, providing long-lasting protection against sweat and odor. What I truly appreciate is how swiftly it dries, leaving no residue on clothing. Not only does it protect, but it also cares, as is expected from Dove; my skin feels moisturized and irritation-free even after daily use. The convenience of having 6 packs means I'm stocked up for a good while, and I can even share with family or friends. An excellent value for the quality and quantity provided!",
