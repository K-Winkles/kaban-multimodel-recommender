That\u2019s why I said \u201cthank goodness for this product,\u201d because we have been looking for a an effective, sensitive skin woman\u2019s product for a long time, and this is the only one we both have found that works well enough. A strong anti-perspirant would provide slightly more wetness control, but the Arm & Hammer Deodorant has been pretty close, and it stops odor. It\u2019s comfortable to apply, not ridiculously expensive, and my grown daughter and I planning on continuing using it. It\u2019s worth a try, without a doubt!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Yay a deodorant for metal allergies!",
                "reviewText": "Over the past year or so, many signs have pointed to the fact that I am allergic to all sorts of metals. My wedding ring (white gold, which has nickel, rhodium, etc.) has left my finder with a constant rash, I have never been able to wear regular earrings without irritation, I've always been allergic to contacts and/or contact solutions, and my mom even said that the reason metal braces didn't work for me in high school is probably because I was allergic to them but they didn't realize it at the time. Similarly, over the past couple years, I have had a growing problem with deodorant - I've been using Dove for at least 20 years with no problem, until a few years ago when I started experiencing B.O. despite all efforts to get rid of it. I tried the prescription grade medicine. I tried using it more often. Nothing worked, until I switched to aluminum-free deodorant. I first tried Dove aluminum-free deodorant, but it's expensive at $10-12 per stick. So I went on Amazon to see what other options were available, and frankly, there aren't many affordable options.I tried this - at half the price of Dove aluminum-free, this Arm & Hammer (the brand my husband has used for decades) deodorant has been a miracle for me. No more B.O. at all. No more irritation at all. No stains on my clothes from the white stick (this is clear). I genuinely feel better.About the smell - yes, it kinda has a weird smell when you first put it on. The smell is vaguely rosemary and lavender, but somehow not the best it could be. It almost has an \"old spice\" weird smell. But the smell does fade quite quickly, and I've gotten used to the smell. I have always loved lavender and rosemary, just not usually together! hahaAbout the sweat-protection - I will admit that no, this doesn't provide quite as good sweat protection as other deodorants. But that's probably because it has fewer chemicals seeping into your armpits! I haven't really experienced a problem, but I have sweat a bit during a workout. At the end of the day, the B.O. I was previously experiencing is gone, so that's a much better result, even if I had to apply more than once per day.About the design and application - I will admit that this does not go on as well as my Dove did because of the design. I don't know why exactly, but I have to make sure the stick is pushed up really far to avoid being scraped by the plastic sides. This could get really annoying at the end of the stick, but I haven't gotten there yet (been using 1 month). I do really like that it's clear though so there is no residue or stains on my clothing.Conclusion: Yes, I will continue buying this until further notice, and I recommend for anyone with a metal allergy looking for an affordable option.",
