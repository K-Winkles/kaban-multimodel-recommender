I'm a heavy equipment operator so I don't have an indoor, low stress, 9-5 by any means. I'm freezing cold, roasting hot, under pressure, & typically work long shifts both during the day & throughout the night. Degree keeps me smelling as fresh as I can from shower to shower & keeps me pretty dry. I won't say 100% I never get sweat marks, but this product seems to work the best for me & over the years I've tried many brands, including the clinical versions. I like this black & white formula because it seems to stain white tees a lot less than other brands & it doesn't make as much of a mess on colored clothing if I put it on before I get dressed, which I sometimes forget & do.Overall, I buy this one in bulk & make sure I have it on hand all the time both at home & in my rv because I live in that when I travel for work. It's a great formula too in that it doesn't give me a rash or make my skin break out. Previously with other brands, I've switched to unscented thinking that was the problem. I think others brands to me, are problematic to my skin. This scent & formula works well for me & hopefully it'll work well for you too :)",
