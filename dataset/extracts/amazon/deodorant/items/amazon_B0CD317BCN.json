OS has a lot of pleasant scents and I very seldom wear cologne unless it\u2019s a special occasion because this deodorant and other OS ones is soft and subtle but pleasant and noticeable, so it leaves me smelling nice, for awhile.The downside is, perhaps it\u2019s just this specific scent mixture not enduring but on work days by around 3-4pm I smell a bit. Nobody seems to notice but I\u2019ll just catch a hint of underarm onion as I reach out or up. I\u2019m sure a light touch up would resolve it, or even another shower and re-application after work if needed. But out of all the scents this one hasn\u2019t held me all day. What I really want is for OS Amber to be brought back. It smelled amazing and lasted all day. Come on Old Spice, Oasis is no Amber.",
