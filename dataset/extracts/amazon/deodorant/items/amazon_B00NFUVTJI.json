I don't regret holding onto a wrong item in May because summer was coming and I could use that too. True, I did take a pic of the actual item that I keep receiving from this listing and it doesn't at all match what they say, but that's because I'm a 100% satisfied customer and the system works perfectly.",

Why on earth you cannot purchase the original scent in stores anymore is beyond me\u2026.. we have repeated this purchase multiple times and will continue to do so!",

My local drugstores seem to stock plenty of deodorants and even a few anti-perspirants, but no products that offered both; not that I could find.",
