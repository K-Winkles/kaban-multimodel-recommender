At her young age, I don\u2019t feel right having her use a \u201cregular\u201d deodorant with aluminum/chemicals so I knew I wanted a more natural option. I was overwhelmed with all of the choices, read tons of reviews, and decided to try this. It seems to work well, goes on clear, doesn\u2019t irritate her skin, and lasts throughout the day. The best part is that it smells really good! It has a sweet, fruity scent that, I feel, is appropriate for a little girl - not the typical perfumey scents that adult deodorants usually have. I\u2019m happy I tried this and will continue to purchase.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: We are in the middle of the summer, going to playgrounds like it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business, and this deodorant is STILL doing a great job! Highly recommend!Let me start off by saying this product is great. I have tried many options and I have been searching for literally years.This product is for my oldest daughter, who just turned 6. Our search for safe deodorants started back when she was 2. Yes, she has had pretty strong body odor since she was 2! I think part of the problem is she sweats more than average and is always on the move, and she just runs warmer than average. We have had her checked out by her doctor, and there\u2019s nothing wrong other than that she happens to have strong body odor.So we started our journey to find a safe deodorant for her. We started with Lume and I THOUGHT I had found my answer, as it worked great for me and also for her\u2026until after a few months when it seemed like we had grown a tolerance to it and our bodies stopped responding to it. I thought perhaps our batch had gone bad, so I ordered brand new Lume and we didn\u2019t respond to the brand new tube either. Back to the drawing board.I have tried Native and Tom\u2019s. Both of those brands only added a scent to her body odor, so it was body odor mixed with whatever scent the tube was. More money wasted.Until I found Fresh Monster! We have been using this for a few months now and have not had any issues. The scent is a little more like citrus and gummy bears and smells SO clean and fresh. My daughter bathes every other day, and she is able to just apply this the first day after bathing and it lasts until she bathes next.I will update my review after the summer months come, but my expectations are high. To say I\u2019m relieved is such an understatement; I feel so hopeful knowing we have found a solution before kids are at that age where they could be mean to someone for being the \u201csmelly kid.\u201d She has great hygiene and unfortunately just has a body odor issue. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f So glad we have found a solution!Adding that I have received no benefit for writing this review; I\u2019m just so happy we found this stuff!",

                "reviewText": "My daughter has been needing deodorant since she turned 7. She\u2019s 9 now. We\u2019ve tried several store bought ones that claimed to be organic, aluminum free, natural etc. but she would always be irritated on her under arms. She started developing a rash even after I switched product\u2019s multiple times. I finally did a cleanse & just stopped using deodorant on her for 4 days to let her pits heal using aquaphor every night. After they healed, & rash went away I tried this new brand & she has not had any irritation at all! She puts it on at night after showering then a small layer in the morning & lasts her all through PE & gymnastics. She\u2019s very active & sweats a whole lot! We\u2019ve been using it 3 weeks now & it\u2019s working great. This helped decrease her wetness & controls her odor. She was getting embarrassed because none of her other deodorants would last.. she would have to apply more after PE, but this is a light fresh fruity scent & she loves it! So happy to find something that works for my sensitive girl. & it gives her more confidence through her daily activities! Will be using this brand with all 4 of my kids! Only negative thing, is it is a creamy so it comes on like lotion almost, but a little goes a long way so it doesn\u2019t take much. She said it feels a little gooey at night but it dries quickly & she\u2019s used to it now. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. But will continue to buy!!",
