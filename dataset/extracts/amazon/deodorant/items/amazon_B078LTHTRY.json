The product itself is solid and white., but when applying it is in fact, clear. I was sceptical when ordering and relieved when I received my order. I don't like the clear, gel like antiperspirants. My experience with those has always broke me out with red bumps,especially if I have recently shaved.I truly recommend this product.",

It smells good, doesn\u2019t show marks, lasts all day, and is gentle on my sensitive skin. I took away one star because my last few have fallen apart when there is still an inch+ of deodorant. That\u2019s still a lot of deodorant to be left for it to be falling out and breaking and making a mess everywhere. I never had this issue until recently so hopefully whatever is making that happen will be resolved.",
