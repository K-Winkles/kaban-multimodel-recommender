I have very sensitive skin and none of these break me out. But most importantly - they work ridiculously well. I put it on in the morning and at bedtime I have zero odor even after a hot day outside at the beach or hiking. I can\u2019t comment on if it helps with sweating or not as I\u2019m not a big underarm sweater so I can\u2019t say if it makes a difference in that department, but it does completely eliminate any body smell. I have not had any b.o. at all since I began using this. I ask my husband and my friends and they confirm. I\u2019ve never had a natural deodorant work very well so this stuff blew my mind. Plus there\u2019s the added bonus of people asking me what I\u2019m wearing that smells so good and I get to tell them that it\u2019s my armpits. :-) Try it. Yes, it\u2019s expensive but it\u2019s worth every penny.",

It goes on much smoother than I had expected for a natural deodorant. Also, the scent is more subtle that I thought it would be, but that's not a bad thing. My husband had to get pretty close in order to smell it after i applied it. Overall I love this product, and it seems to work well for me.",

                "reviewText": "I finally caved after seeing this all over my TikTok FYP. It smells SO good. I got the Santal & Vetiver scent. Salt & Stone's packaging is really beautiful too...I love the neutral/clay colors. I have worn this for a couple of days already and have no complaints... the smell is lovely but not overwhelming - I get subtle whiffs of it when I'm moving about my day. I can't say much about the antiperspirant properties just yet as I haven't put it through the test of a workout, but I will update my review once I do. My only tiny complaint would be that it goes on very wet, so be careful when applying so that it doesn't get all over the place.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m always highly skeptical of natural deodorants and have not had good experiences with other brands in the past. I\u2019ve used this product 2 days in a row and so far I\u2019m impressed. After a 12 hour workday I made my husband do a smell test and he goes \u201cweird it smells really good still\u201d. Absolutely no body odor came through this heavenly scent. I am typically sensitive to baking soda so I half expected to get a rash from this product but so far I have not! Overall the product goes on relatively smoothly, likely because of the coconut oil and shea butter ingredients. If you are looking to try a new natural deodorant I would definitely give this a shot. I also purchased the gel version and will be reviewing that in the coming days.",

It does indeed smell good and I knew it was not an antiperspirant but it does not do its job of keeping away BO. A few hours after I apply it that familiar smell starts coming back. I am not interested in a product I need to apply multiple times a day. I will not be repurchasing this product which is a shame because I wanted it to work so badly.",

And it made my pits break out in what looked and felt like razor burn, which I never ever get on my pits otherwise, and which went away as soon as I stopped using it.",
