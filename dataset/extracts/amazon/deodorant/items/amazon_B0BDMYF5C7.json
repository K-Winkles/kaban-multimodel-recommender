This stuff is amazing, it doesn't leave streaks on my clothes. It's goes on easy. I have yet to stink AT ALL, even over night since I've started using this and I have had zero irritation or discoloration.I'm a relatively sweaty person and I tend to need to reapply deodorant twice during the day but with this it's once in the morning and I'm good all day long.Not a whole lot of scent behind it but I don't mind that, it's nice enough and as long as I don't stink I'm a happy camper!",

Finally I have found the best deodorant! Please Eco Roots , don't change a thing. Both me and my daughter have had issues with finding a deodorant that works. Of course all \"natural deodorants are expensive, but I would have no issue if they actually worked. We tried Lume for a good while but I stunk by the end of the day unless I reapplied. This deodorant cream has little scent but I don't smell throughout the day and no rash or irritation. Thank you!",

                "reviewText": "I started this year hoping to make some changes in the products I use to feel less like garbage about being under the tyranny of capitalism, and, yes, I see the humor of saying that on friggin AMAZON, but living in a small town in rural Appalachia, you have to accept that the convenience of access is just not there anymore outside of places that deliver to you.But this isn't about that, this is about this deodorant. Let me be honest. Personally, I like it. I spend pretty much every waking moment hotter than (insert folksy comparison of choice), but sweating is natural and fine and I wasn't looking for an antiperspirant, just something that'd last for 12+ hours and still smell alright at the end, which this succeeds,The... bad part. I work in a prison. Low security little camp out a few hours from home, and I travel out there a week at a time. Monday comes, I roll up to work, get myself together in my room in the barracks, smear on some of this stuff, throw on my uniform, and head in. Hanging out with another officer, inmate comes over, starts asking a question, gets distracted, asks if either me or the other officer are using bengay. And then it hits me. This deodorant smells straight up like bengay. And I suddenly realize the scent is SO strong and there would be no way to get through a work week using it without hearing a bunch of stupid comments. Anyway, I'm a baby and I went to the dollar store and grabbed some cheap crap deodorant that I hate comparatively, but!! I use this at home pretty often.It does smell super strong which is probably usually a good thing, because I am 110% sure I did not smell like armpit at all when using it. Only thing I don't love is that it is a thick cream that I have applied using a little dollop with my bare hands, and rawdogging this stuff leaves my hands... greasy? I dunno, I always have to wash them after, which is fine, but less convenient than some alternatives. Other than me being a wimp and the greasy thing, this stuff rules for me. Wife doesn't think it works as well for her, but she has a more physically demanding job, so maybe consider how intense a product you need. Sitting in an unconditioned room with a single fan for twelve hours hot sweat, this stuff works great. Handling animals and spending 2/3s of a day walking outside hot, maybe look for something stronger. All bods are different, but this was a win for me.",
