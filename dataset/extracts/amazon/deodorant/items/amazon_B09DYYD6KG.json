                "reviewText": "I have been on a long search for several years now to find a natural deodorant that actually works for me. Let me say that everybody\u2019s body chemistry is different so what works for one person might not work for another but I have a big problem with sweaty armpits. I do not sweat very much in general unless I am working out except for my pits for some reason I used to have to use clinical deodorant and it was the only thing that worked, however clinical deodorant has icky chemicals and I am trying to rid myself of chemicals andy be a healthier person. Anytime I see a different kind of natural deodorant I buy it and most of them did not work at all a few of them worked a little but had to reapply often I have only had success with two kinds but there was some drawbacks to the other kind that worked for me. The bravo Sierra brand goes on smoothly not gritty at all almost every other kind of natural deodorant I have tried has been gritty except one but that one did not work well. It does not bother sensitive skin unless I just got done shaving then it is a little bit burnie for a moment or two then goes away. I think this is normal for any kind of deodorant though so it does not lose any stars for that. It actually works meaning I do not stink even after a workout in humid weather. Natural deodorant do not stop a person from sweating however this one helps with absorption of that sweat so I do not feel sweaty when I wear this deodorant. It goes on clear. It smells good, though I want to try a different scent as this one is a bit masculine in my opinion. When I first put it on the smell is a bit strong but it mellows out after a little while however if I raise my arms up I can still smell it so I figure it is working the way it is supposed to without being overpowering. My husband also likes this deodorant and the smell of the lemon and tonka bean be however he prefers the spray from this brand in the cedar citrus scent. I think this is my favorite deodorant as far as performance gos but just for reference the other natural deodorant that worked for me was Schmitz, my husband actually likes that one better however I had to re-apply that partway through the day and I do not with the bravo Sierra brand it lasts all day even through a work out. He however says he can apply the Schmitz and it lasts two days for him so like I said everybody\u2019s body chemistry is different. I think the Schmitz is grittier then the bravo Sierra so I like the bravo Sierra texture better. However I do like the Schmitz sent options better, their Jasmine T specifically is my favorite but I like a lot of their sents. There is something in the bravo Ciara that reminds me a little of soap but it is not very strong just faintly noticeable. All in all I will have to try other sents in this brand however it is my new go to I just wish they had a few more feminine sent options.",

                "reviewText": "The tonka bean and lemon scent smells good. It applies easily (no burning and not abrasive) and it doesn't leave marks on your shirt so you can apply it BEFORE putting on your shirt if you like.It lasts as long as long as most deodorants but not as long as anti-perspirant + deodorant. However, the idea is to get away from aluminum. I have to wear body armor 10 hours/day, so finding a strong deodorant that holds up is a challenge.UPDATE: I ordered multiple Bravo Sierra sticks and body sprays to test and compare. The Tonka Bean and Lemon is by far the best stick scent and body spray scent. They work pretty well but on really sweaty days, it may be necessary to reapply the deodorant.I ordered deodorant sticks in Citrus and Cedarwood, White Vetiver and Cedarwood, and Sandalwood and Fig. I had the highest hopes for Sandalwood & Fig which made it all the more disappointing that it doesn't smell good. If the stock doesn't smell good, I don't feel the need to try the body spray.Citrus & Cedarwood and White Vetiver & Cedarwood sticks smell okay, but not great. They're nothing compared to Tonka Bean & Lemon.The body spray for White Vetiver & Cedarwood is revolting. Its scent is strong but it's absolutely nauseating. I think it would probably be an effective mosquito repellent because even mosquitos would say \"that stinks too much\" to want to bite you. The mosquito repellent brand \"OFF!\" has a more pleasing smell than Bravo Sierra's White Vetiver & Cedarwood body spray. I wish I were joking.The Citrus & Cedarwood body spray isn't as overwhelming and gross as the White Vetiver & Cedarwood body spray, but it's not good. When I sprayed it in my body and asked my girlfriend to smell it, she shook her head no. She agreed it wasn't as awful as White Vetiver & Cedarwood but still not pleasing.Alas, the only Bravo Sierra sticks and body spray I would recommend is the Tonka Bean and Lemon. I downgrade them to 4* because there is no 4.5 star option, and it doesn't always last the full day. As for the longest-lasting odor protection of all the magnesium deodorant brands, I give that award to Crystal's Charcoal & Tea Tree. It will last 10 hours+ of wearing body armor even in hot summer days without requiring reapplication.",

Your results may vary because there are an actual several billion people on earth and hey man, we're all different so deal. But for *me*, it's awesome. I don't smell like doody for at least a full day, the stick itself lasts about a month, and I don't get rashes like I did with the stuff that rhymes with Cold Price. Have used at least three different scents and liked them all.In conclusion, it's an excellent product and supports a great company: 5/5 Stars, wood use daily.",
