                "reviewText": "My husband is a stress sweater. He sweats through his business shirts/undershirts, which is so strange because he hides the stress on his face but he\u2019s dripping underneath. It\u2019s mostly at work during meetings so I wasn\u2019t 100% fully aware of the whole picture until he started doing zoom meetings from home and confided in me and said the words \u201cstress sweat,\u201d which I had never heard of. He was soo embarrassed and frustrated about it. Once he actually confided in me that it was \u201cstress sweat\u201d I went on a hunt to solve the problem doing tons of research on reviews, Tiktoks, etc\u2026. I ordered many, many different products including padded t-shirts. None of them worked. Then one day I found this! He says this is the best one! He said \u201cit didn\u2019t work 100% the first day, but after the second day it solved the problem.\u201d The proof is in his non-stained, dry shirts. He\u2019s super relieved and happy with this product!!",
