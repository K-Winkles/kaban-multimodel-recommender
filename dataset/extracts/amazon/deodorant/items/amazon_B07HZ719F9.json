Only later did we realize that they were a team of actual seals and far better divers than mountain climbers. At any rate, they made it work and we all learned something in the process. Wilderness With Lavender smells like a hike through the rugged backcountry in spring. That's about as manly as flower-tromping gets. Old Spice Men's Invisible Solid Antiperspirant and Deodorant reduces armpit sweat, goes on invisible, and stays feeling dry. So bring the scent of your adventures home or smell like the adventures you haven't ventured yet. We won't judge. Just do you, guy.",

I decided to try out this deodorant because I figured lavender would be a decent scent. It isn't super feminine, but it's not a harsh, masculine scent -- very unisex. It isn't an invisible solid, though I've never really experienced a product that lived up to those claims -- just carry around a piece of nylon and rub onto the marks to remove -- you can thank me later. I don't feel like I need to reapply this throughout the day. Very happy with this product.",

On a whim I looked for it a few weeks back on Amazon. Low and behold, found it! (Big surprise right? Lol. Amazon has almost EVERYTHING!!) WELL FIRST OFF, $10 for pit stick is waay too steep in the first place. Secondly Anti-persprant give mevan allergic reaction and makes the skin in my armpits peel, so I only and always buy just the deodorant. Well the day came (seems like everyday) my package came.... and the sent the anti perspiration type... the type im allergic to. I dont write reviews often but I just felt this was total BS!! I mean Amazon is NOT a fast food joint in the sense that they get orders wrong. In my case Amazon has like a 99.99% success rate as far as sending the proper item. Im not bashing the 'zon ... im bashing old spice. In my mind they ripped me off!!! Charged too much and sent the wrong item ... probably because they didn't have the right type on hand. I wouldve been fine waiting. Not to mention sending back the wrong thing that cost only $10 was a waste of time. Its just frustratingRant over",
