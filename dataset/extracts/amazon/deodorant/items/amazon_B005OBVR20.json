I used to buy the \"Original\" version (also called \"Original Solid\"), but a few years ago I switched to the \"Invisible\" version (also called \"Invisible Solid\"). In the container, you can't tell any difference. But on the body, the difference appears to be that the \"Original\" version doesn't disappear into the skin as quickly as the \"Invisible\" version. I can't tell any difference in the anti-perspirant action.Be sure to check the price per ounce. There's a surprising difference in cost for the identical product from different suppliers. My previous order was $1.35/ounce, while this latest order was $0.97/ounce.",
