                "reviewText": "I have been using Unscented Mitchum for 40 years. Once I hit puberty, the stink was on. Most products for women were marketed as deodorant, which meant they didn't stop the sweating, and most of the deodorants didn't stop the bacteria which causes the smell. The deodorants for women were basically perfume in a viscous alcohol solution. And I was usually allergic to it.Then everything changed with antiperspirant that prevented sweating! Whee! No more smell & fungal infections which can occur when the skin never really dries. After 4 months of experimenting, I started sneaking Dad's unscented Mitchum.Over the last 40 years, I'd occasionally tried other stuff, but I always come back to it. If you have \"problem body odor\" or deal with the public, this the product for you!",
