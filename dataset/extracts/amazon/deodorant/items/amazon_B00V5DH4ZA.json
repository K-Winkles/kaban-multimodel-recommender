I\u2019ve never tried gel before but I can honestly say I love the gel. at first it felt weird but after a few more times I\u2019ve gotten used to it.

Tried many other deodorants that wouldn\u2019t cover the smell enough or just weren\u2019t great quality and didn\u2019t last more than a few hours but this one does the trick. It goes on smoothly and I can go 2 days without even needing to reapply! That\u2019s huge for me. I\u2019m not a huge fan of the scent because it is a bit chemically to me but I am very sensitive to scents. It\u2019s not so much that it\u2019s overwhelming and the smell isn\u2019t too strong once you put it on and it dries. Definitely going to be repurchasing this one!",
