                "reviewText": "recently tried out the AXE Apollo Antiperspirant Deodorant Stick For Men in the Sage & Cedarwood scent, and there are definitely some things I really like about it. First and foremost, let's talk about the scent - it's fantastic! The combination of sage and cedarwood gives it a unique and refreshing aroma that stands out among many other deodorants I've tried. It's a pleasant departure from the typical deodorant scents and provides a subtle, masculine fragrance that lasts throughout the day.However, there is one aspect of this deodorant that leaves me wanting a bit more, and that's its longevity. While it claims to be a 48-hour antiperspirant, I found that it doesn't quite live up to that promise. It keeps me feeling fresh and sweat-free for a good portion of the day, but I did notice that I needed to reapply it sooner than expected, especially during more active days. In comparison to some other brands I've used, the lasting power falls a bit short.That being said, the AXE Apollo Antiperspirant Deodorant Stick has its strong points. It's easy to apply, doesn't leave residue on my clothes, and the scent truly is a winner. Plus, the price is reasonable, making it an affordable option for those looking for a great-smelling deodorant.In conclusion, the AXE Apollo Antiperspirant Deodorant Stick in Sage & Cedarwood is a solid choice for those who value a pleasant fragrance in their deodorant. While it might not provide the full 48-hour protection it claims, it still does a good job for everyday use, and the scent alone makes it worth a try if you're in the market for a new deodorant. I would rate it at four stars for its fragrance and overall effectiveness, but it does lose a star due to its slightly shorter longevity compared to some other brands.",
