It is sweet, and more of a fruity/raspberry scent, I can't personally decipher the other part of the scent as rose, raspberry is definitely the prominent fragrance that matches well with my body sprays. It glides on easy and is more of a gel type formula, less is more and I apply with lighter pressure than I would with other stick deodorants. I don't personally think this is a 72hour deodorant, for me it's more of a 12 hour, apply each morning kind. The scent is still there the next morning, but it is very faint. It does not have the staying power or the strong scent like others I've tried such as Lume.",

Glides on super smooth and has a wide coverage head. Very breathable for the skin. Definitely lasts the whole day, but I am not going to see if it lasts 72 hours - I am just not the type to take that risk! It is aluminum free which is awesome. They add vitamin care with B3 for natural odor prevention, which makes it unique. The only downside is that it is not an antiperspirant, which I need because I sweat a lot. All in all, I'm pleased with the scent and breathability but if I'm going to be somewhere on a hot day, I'm going to go with an antiperspirant.",

Real clean smelling. They do claim that you get 72 hours of protection but I am not going to test that one out! \ud83d\ude02 It does glide on clear and didn't irritate my skin in the least. I am a fan of Dove soap and now of their deodorant. I have only had it on for an hour or so and love it. If something changes I will come on back here and update but I think I love this stuff! Little tiny bit on the pricey side is my only con. Other than that I do recommend. SMELLS SOOOO GOOD!!! \ud83d\ude0b",

                "reviewText": "I have used Dove products for years: beauty bar, body wash, Clinical Strength deodorant, and aerosol deodorant. Now, even in the midst of hot flashes, I am fortunate not to sweat under my arms (just everywhere else--fun), so I didn't think it would be an issue to use a product that is solely a deodorant without an anti-perspirant.While I loved the light, fruity-floral smell of this deodorant, the actual product made my underarms feel positively moist--not wet, moist. Gross. At first, I figured it would go away after it had a chance to dry, but after a half an hour, it was clear that I was wrong. I was about to head out with my family, and I knew I'd be so distracted and irritable by the miserable sensation, so I ran upstairs and put my regular Dove over it. So. Much. Better.If the Clinical variety is ever made in the raspberry and rose scent, I will snatch it right up, but from now on, I'm steering clear of this VitaminCare+ stick. I can also easily envision it getting on and rubbing into the fiber of my clothes and eventually ruining them under the armpit area, and I don't have the time, money, or inclination to get a new wardrobe because of a stick of deodorant. This is a hard pass for me.",

Second, it smells absolutely amazing. It glides on easily and dried quickly. The most important thing is that it works! I don't get smelly later in the day. It just does exactly what I need it too while smelling great. Love love love this product!",
