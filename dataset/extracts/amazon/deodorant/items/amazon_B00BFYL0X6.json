It lasts the longest for me and I love the fresh scent. Of the deodorant types I have tried, it also has the least level of transfer onto my clothes (as long as you wait for it to dry)!Also - this is a larger size and lasts longer.

                "reviewText": "Oh, Secret Deodorant, you sly little companion in my daily battle against unpleasant odors. You claim to keep me fresh and dry, but can you really keep a secret? Well, let's dive into this fragrant adventure and find out!First things first, the packaging. It's like a secret agent disguised as a deodorant stick. Sleek, slender, and covertly hiding in my bathroom drawer. I almost expected it to come with a tiny magnifying glass and a mission briefing. If only it could whisper classified information into my ear, like, \"Agent Freshness, your mission is to stay odor-free all day. Good luck!\"Now, let's talk about the scent. Ah, the sweet mystery of Secret Deodorant. It's like a clandestine blend of flowers and confidence. Every time I raise my arms, I imagine a bouquet of roses and lilies bursting forth, overpowering any whiff of uncertainty. It's like having a secret weapon against body odor. The scent is so alluring; I almost feel like I should be sneaking around, undercover, on a top-secret mission to sniff out freshness.But does it pass the ultimate test\u2014the battle against sweat? Well, I'm happy to report that Secret Deodorant is as reliable as a secret agent on a mission. It keeps my underarms drier than the Sahara Desert on a scorching summer day. Even during intense workouts or nerve-wracking situations, I can trust Secret to keep me cool and collected, as if I have my own personal air-conditioning system under my arms.Now, I must admit, there is one tiny quirk I've noticed. Sometimes, Secret Deodorant can be a bit too secretive. Just when I need it the most, I find myself struggling with the invisible shield it creates. It's like a magician's trick, making my underarms disappear from the world. But hey, I suppose it's a small price to pay for staying fresh and odor-free throughout the day.In conclusion, Secret Deodorant is the stealthy sidekick every armpit deserves. Its mysterious allure, covert protection, and ability to keep secrets (like how many times I've rewatched my favorite TV show) make it a top choice for those seeking freshness and a dash of intrigue in their lives. So go ahead, embrace the secrecy, and let Secret Deodorant be your trusty accomplice in the quest for underarm freshness!Disclaimer: No spies were harmed in the making of this review.",

I can smell it perfectly fine, but my sister we r says she can hardly smell anything. I'd call ut a step above unscented.Price... expensive. $16 so it's more than $5 each *sigh*. Hopefully I can find this at a store for cheaper when I get past my first trimester.Secret seems to be the only deodorant that works for me. I'm a heavy sweater, like I sweat in the middle of a snow storm heavy. It's ridiculous. But this one hasn't worn out on me midday.",
