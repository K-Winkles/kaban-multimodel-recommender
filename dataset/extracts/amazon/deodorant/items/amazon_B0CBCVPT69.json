Light scent doesn\u2019t overpower perfume, stays fresh and keeps me dry all day.I get the same great coverage as I have come to expect from Degree products but with a new lovely scent.Thank you.\u2764\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f",

I cannot get in and out of a bathtub like when I was younger. And my shoulders don\u2019t work, and they scream with pain when I try. So this product is a God Send to me. It doesn\u2019t have a strong fake perfume smell and it covers up/stops my horrible BO. What more can I say in its favor. The product is small enough for my almost useless arms to hold and apply to my underarms. Yay!",
