I've been using Mitchum for more than 20 years and have never had any such problem with it. My underarm skin is completely comfortable and normal.Another plus is that it doesn't turn the armpits of your t-shirts yellow; not a trace of discoloration in my clothing in all the years I've been using it. It is not completely unscented, but the slight scent it has is gone by the time it dries. And the gel formulation is truly effective for 48 hours. I live in the desert, where temperatures over 100 are common. I remain dry for two days as advertised.I agree with a few of the other reviews that complain about the packaging; it does tend to run down the outside of the container. Not enough to be a deal breaker.",
