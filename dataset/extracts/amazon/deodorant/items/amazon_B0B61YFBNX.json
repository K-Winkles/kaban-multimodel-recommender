I think a lot of it is hormonal, but whatever the reason, deodorants weren't helping; if anything, they made it worse. After reading the reviews with skepticism, I thought \"well, might as well try this one\" even though I knew how angry I was going to be if I was wasting $18 on more disappointment. I couldn't wait to try it, and OMG it worked!!! I live in FL and went to disney for an entire day, and I DID NOT SMELL AT ALL! I truly couldn't believe it, especially since it was the unscented. I have also purchased the Eucalyptus, which is fine, but I prefer the unscented. Both work amazingly though. So, if you are like me and have lost hope in finding something that actually works, it's worth giving it a try.",

                "reviewText": "I have repurchased this 5 times & I keep on because I\u2019ve been able to find anything like it.Here\u2019s all you need to know:My stats: 28 yr old, woman, active, in shape, trying to treat chronic underarm odorThe product: THIS IS A TREATMENT, Not a DeodorantHow to use: Apply this immediately after getting out of the shower and drying off. Do this right away because once the smell starts, this will not work to treat existing odor. It only continues to work when starting with clean, odor free skin.After it dries, you will need to apply a deodorant on top that will work to stick all day.Results: This works as a treatment pre deodorant in terms of preventing odor or having a very strong one later in the day. For me, this did not work as a solution to my issue but I keep buying it because it helps with initially not smelling but later on in the day it begins to wear off. If I reapply it doesn\u2019t work to treat the new odor. I haven\u2019t found anything that would even help lessen the odor without getting a massive allergic reaction. This gives no reaction even on broken skin. NONE.Conclusion: I am still on the hunt to find a deodorant that will treat my underarm smell without giving me an allergic reaction. I have bought at-least 50 kinds from all different brands and they either don\u2019t work or the clinical strength ones work but I get a horrible rash. I will keep using this as a base treatment to help to lessen the odor but even for that it is very expensive. Until I find the magic one that does both, I\u2019ll continue to purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This product is great! Helped to even out my skin tone and keeps me odor free after 3+ years of dealing with stinky armpits.I was dealing with very bad odor in my armpits that I just could not get rid of after having kids. I gave the unscented version of this deodorant a try and with the first two uses, I still stunk. But I now even when I sweat, I smell NOTHING.If you feel like you still stink try these steps!1) Start using an exfoliating mitt lightly in your armpits. The deodorant already has AHA to exfoliate so you don\u2019t want to over exfoliate and irritate the skin. But you do want to make sure you\u2019re cleaning off all the bacteria and gunk that any stick deodorants and clothes were leaving behind2) apply this deodorant nightly so that it gets the chance to absorb without the extra sweating. Apply in the morning if you feel like you need itSweat is generally supposed to be odorless so if you stink, chances are there is stuff that\u2019s gunked up in the area that is causing you to stink. So just find a better cleaning device. A loofah and washcloth didn\u2019t cut it for me. I switched to a Korean exfoliating mitt and this deodorant was able to work its magic!",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE:I'm giving this a 1 star. It did not hold the smell but I believe made me smell musty-er. I did not see much changes using this. I decided to just stick with the toner because it actually helps with odor control, color, and boils and many other things. This was way too expensive and did nothing for me within the 3 bottles I bought. I could literally say, I gave this a trail period and this last bottle I'm not even finishing it. Out here smelling like a grown man after 5 hours of basketball practice smh. I would let it dry before i put on a shirt and on some days, if I'm not doing much activity at all (just in a car and out, less then 30 mins walking) it might last but it is not worth it for me. I did not see much difference in the color of my underarm and I was not consistent with the tumeric soap or the toner, only I was consistent with this. I can't say much about any boils or bumps underarm because it truly also depends on your intake of foods. Since I consume more sugar and dairy, I had a few more breakouts and I can't blame this for not preventing that.I'm using this for some weeks now. I nearly gave up on it week 1 because it did not help with odor, especially in the heat wave we had. It didn't even last 30 mins. Im not sure about the lightened of the arms yet but that's why I'm sticking with it. I use another deodorant at times and use this when I know I'm not going to sweat too much. Hopefully I can come back and give results on how my underarms lightened up. I'm using this and tumeric soap. Also I use a toner from ordinary.",

                "reviewText": "I was so excited about this product! When I started using it it worked great! I loved the scent, I loved how it went on, and how it kept body odor at bay. After about 2 weeks of using it daily I developed a terrible skin irritation under my arms and have not been able to use it since as my skin is still healing. Maybe I\u2019ll have to have a deodorant rotation so it doesn\u2019t irritate my skin with prolonged use. I\u2019m not sure what is in it that has caused the irritation but it did leave a large red rash all over my under arm.",
