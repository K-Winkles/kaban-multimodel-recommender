All our Schmidt's vegan deodorant sticks require only a small amount for overall effectiveness. To use, hold the deodorant briefly to skin to soften on contact with your body heat. Gently apply 1-2 swipes to dry, clean underarms to keep you feeling fresh all day. This aluminum free deodorant for men and women uses a non-greasy/non-sticky formula that is easily absorbed. Do not apply to irritated, damaged, or freshly shaved skin.",
