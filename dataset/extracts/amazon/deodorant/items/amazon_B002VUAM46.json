                "reviewText": "The antiperspirant aspect is where this deodorant really shines. I'm an outdoorsy guy - I hike, bike, and am generally pretty active. I've used this deodorant on some pretty humid days, and it's kept me dry and comfortable throughout. No embarrassing sweat patches, which is a relief. And it doesn't leave those annoying white marks on my clothes, another big win.As for odor protection, it holds up pretty well there too. Even after a long day, I don't find myself needing to reapply. It's nice to know that I can put it on in the morning and not worry about it for the rest of the day.The stick form is easy to use and it doesn't go on too thick or greasy. Some deodorants feel heavy or sticky, but this one's pretty lightweight.In terms of value, the 4-pack is a good deal. It's more economical than buying single packs and means I don\u2019t have to worry about running out for a while.Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the Degree Men Antiperspirant Deodorant Adventure. It's not a miracle product, but it does its job well. It's a reliable choice for anyone looking for a solid, no-fuss deodorant that can handle a bit of sweat and adventure.",
