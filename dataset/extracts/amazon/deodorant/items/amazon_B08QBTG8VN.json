                "reviewText": "I switched to Magnesium-based deodorants about 3-3.5 years ago. I've tried several brands which were too coarse to apply or just didn't spread/too dry or hard, but instead caked onto the armpits of my t-shirt (Schmidt's charcoal). I've tried some that just didn't work worth a darn (Native, Tom's, and the Walmart copy of Tom's, Every Man Jack). I've tried Arm & Hammer's aluminum free deodorant (no magnesium though) and it didn't last long enough. Didn't smell that great either. The Tom's brand really stinks, so \"deodorant\" is a misnomer. It should be called \"odor replacer.\"I've tried Nfuse mountain scent, although it didn't smell like a mountain spring. It's strong in scent and seems to work really well, but it's a gel and you smell it all day. I wanted a stick deodorant that applied smoothly like the Dove anti-perspirant deodorant I used to wear. Like Crystal, NFuse is too expensive.Ultimately I landed on Ivory and their hint of aloe scent. It applies on your body with the same consistency as any other deodorant stick, it lasts for a long time, and it smells good without being too strong. Their coconut scent's not bad either. It was under $5/stick until Bidenomics/massive inflation took effect. I order the Ivory Hint of Aloe 4 packs here on Amazon for about $23.I stumbled across Crystal on Amazon and decided to give the charcoal & tea tree scent a try. The tea tree smell is a little strong at first; I prefer the charcoal scent portion more. It glides on easy and 28 hours later, I still don't have any underarm BO. It's been very effective and the scent is good. I'll go for a bike ride later today and really test it out.My only knock on this product is the price. At $14.32/stick, it's not affordable and there are much cheaper and very effective alternatives. It may not be as expensive as those deodorant sticks you buy at the department store that match your cologne/after shave, but still very pricey. Going through a stick per month, even with inflation, I can buy a year's supply of Ivory magnesium deodorant in 4 packs for just under $69, before taxes. A year's supply of Crystal is $169, before taxes. If they could get the price down to even $7-$8, I'd give them a 5* rating and use it daily.UPDATE: This stuff works the best of any magnesium deodorant I've tried but it's a poor value. I'm not going to spring $14.32/deodorant stick for Crystal when I can buy Ivory sticks for $5.75/stick. That's 60% less money for a product that's 90+% as effective, with only the added hassle of remembering to put your shirt on first to keep it from leaving streaks on your clothes.",

It\u2019s not a compromise for me at all, and I\u2019ll never return to harmful antiperspirants! The Vanilla and Coconut is my favorite. I previously tried the cucumber one, and that one didn\u2019t work for me as well: I did smell using that one, I guess the flavor matters!",

                "reviewText": "This smells absolutely incredible and I didn't notice any BO but when I put it on it feels sticky. I also need to point out because I didn't realize but this won't help with sweat. I'm a massage therapist and 3.5 hrs into work I feel sweaty and gross. I didn't smell but I realized I can't do something that doesn't deal with sweat as well. If you don't work in a hot environment or sweat much, you may love this. I had no negative skin reactions and it really does smell awesome.",

I'm a loyal user of the original crystal deodorant, but I wanted something more like a traditional deodorant (though still gentle and minimal chemicals, etc.) for when I start to stink and need just a few more hours of stink-coverage until I can get to a shower. This deodorant was lightweight, comfortable, and caused zero skin issues for me. However, it smells horrid. I'm not even sure how to describe it other than damp and squishy. And that's before you put it on. Maybe it's just this particular \"flavor,\" but it's a no for me.",
