Plus, the deodorant\u2019s staying power is impressive \u2013 it keeps me feeling fresh throughout the day. The fact that it\u2019s cruelty-free and made without aluminum or parabens aligns perfectly with my preference for clean beauty products. Native Deodorant has become my go-to, proving that you don\u2019t have to compromise on performance for a natural deodorant. Highly recommend for anyone looking for an effective and clean option!",

I didn't think it would be a big deal when I purchased it however, I have noticed some of my shirts stained from sweat because there is no antiperspirant in it. I do love the scent, my husband has even commented on it as well. I use the same scent in the shampoo and conditioner. I do think it is great for sensitive skin and it does last for most of the day. I was made aware that it should be reapplied not only in the AM but also in the PM so I am starting to try that and it works great.",

                "reviewText": "to make a long review very short, this deodorant works better than advertised. i'm not sure if it's the specific scent formula or what, but damn, it's good. now for the long part, i work for a chain coffee shop, (yes that one) and i run around constantly lifting heavy kegs, jugs of milk, inventory boxes, and dishes, all while being in humid conditions because of the steam from the steam wands and dishwasher, as well as lack of decent airflow.with most clothing nowadays being a mixture of polyester or nylon or spandex, they don't do a really good job at keeping one cool. thus, the constant moving around, stress in general and temperature, leaves one in need of a shower most nights, to keep it pg. i've tried many \"wholistic\" deodorants cause i would like something that works but doesn't contain harsh chemicals or antiperspirants. and as many would expect, it doesn't work at all.in comes native, who not only has blown me away with its ingredients but with how well this preforms in my day to day life. i had to go from keeping deodorant on me just in case, to being able to go to school, go to work, and finish the day with a heavy workout and still smell fresh. i've put this product through hell and back in one of our busiest days of the year and it blew my mind.all of this is to say, my hats off to you, native, for making a wholistic deodorant that actually preforms well under any conditions, smells so good, actually contains great ingredients that have been harvested under sustainable and fair conditions, and stays all day long with no reapplication. i've really never written a long and detailed review like this, but for something that's helped to build my confidence and then some, it's the least that i could do. so moral of this whole review, give it a try, it's solved my problems, it will solve yours too.",

The 72-hour odor control is not an exaggeration \u2013 it keeps me feeling fresh and confident all day long. The natural ingredients like baking soda, coconut oil, and shea butter make it gentle on my skin. The Coconut & Vanilla scent is subtle yet delightful. I appreciate that it's aluminum-free, providing a healthier alternative. The pack of 3 is cost-effective, and the easy application makes it a convenient choice. If you're on the lookout for an effective and natural deodorant with a pleasant scent, Native is definitely worth trying.",
