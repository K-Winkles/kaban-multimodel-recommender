                "reviewText": "One of the primary reasons I chose this deodorant was its promise to protect against deodorant stains on black and white clothing. I'm pleased to report that it lives up to its claims. After weeks of use, I've noticed a significant reduction in unsightly deodorant marks on my shirts. This feature alone makes it a standout product.The \"instant dry\" claim is not an exaggeration. The spray goes on and dries almost immediately, leaving me feeling fresh without any sticky residue. This quick-dry feature is perfect for those busy mornings when I'm in a rush.Degree Men Antiperspirant Spray effectively keeps me feeling dry and smelling fresh throughout the day. It provides reliable sweat and odor protection, which is especially important during hot and active days.While the scent is pleasant and not overpowering, it's worth noting that scent preferences can vary widely among individuals. I would appreciate more variety in the available scents to cater to different preferences.Degree Men Antiperspirant Spray Black + White in a pack of three is a reliable choice for anyone seeking effective protection against deodorant stains and long-lasting sweat and odor control. Its instant dry formula is a game-changer for busy individuals, and the compact packaging makes it suitable for everyday use and travel. While the scent is pleasant, offering more fragrance options would be a welcome improvement. If you're tired of dealing with deodorant stains on your clothing and want a deodorant that delivers on its promises, I highly recommend giving this product a try. It has become a staple in my daily routine, providing the protection and confidence I need to tackle the day ahead.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this particular product for a couple of years and it is my favorite. I have a physical job and I sweat a lot. Stick deodorants are out because I get a rash from them.Plus: decent price for a 3 pack, lasts through a 4 hour shift and most of the day after work, aerosol spray, non-sticky.Minus: not even close to 72 hour life, aerosol spray not enviro-friendly, price, does leave yellow stains on whites after a several uses (I wear white T's on an exercise bike and they get soaked during the workout then I hang on a hangar to dry before they get washed)Bottom line, convenient, effective odor control, 3 pack saves trips (I don't go through it fast enough to warrant making it a periodic delivery).",

                "reviewText": "Shirt stains and heavy sweating have always been a problem for me. So I apply more deodorant/antiperspirant than most people. This causes my shirts to be stained by the white chalky stuff that normal for deodorant bars. I\u2019d tried gel in the past and found that they didn\u2019t perform as well. So when I heard about this I was very skeptical. I tried it and not only does it not stain my shirts but it actually keeps me dry. I\u2019ve even had shirts that I thought were ruined eventually wash old stains out to where they are useable again. Super impressed with this product and will be using it exclusively in the future.",
