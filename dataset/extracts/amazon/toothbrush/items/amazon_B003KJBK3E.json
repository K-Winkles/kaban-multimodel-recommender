This was our first \u201creal\u201d toothbrush I bought for them. I read all the reviews and some said about bristles falling out and it being too hard, too big etc. but I decided to try it anyway.I absolutely love these toothbrushes and so do my girls. It is very SOFT - (can\u2019t be TOO soft, needs a tiny bit of stiffness to actually \u201cbrush\u201d teeth). In no way did it ever cause discomfort to my girls. I also don\u2019t brush so hard that it would hurt them. I yanked on the bristles when I got them to see if any would fall out and they didn\u2019t. They bite the brushes and they\u2019ve held up with no bristles coming loose. I actually like the \u201cfatter\u201d brush head as I find it easier to find their little teeth and cover the entire tooth when brushing. It\u2019s smaller with a thicker handle and easy for them to hold. They also love it so much that they cry when I take it away. I am going to purchase more for them to hold while we brush and then extras to change out as needed.They are also made in the USA, BPA free and FDA approved!",

I don't know why other places have such tiny heads for toothbrushing... But on a squirmy toddler I don't have time for precision, I need the larger surface area!They are much softer than other toddler toothbrushes out there.",
