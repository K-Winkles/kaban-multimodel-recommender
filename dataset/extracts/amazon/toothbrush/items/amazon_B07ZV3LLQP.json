I figured I'd give these a shot--I know Colgate is a good brand. Soft bristles are dentist-preferred, and I was curious about the whole Charcoal craze.Unfortunately, these suck. Every time I brush my teeth, the bristles fall out and I end up having to pick them out of my mouth or spit them into the sink. It's gross. What if someone were to accidentally swallow those things?I gave it a few tries since I was hoping the super loose bristles was maybe just a first time or second time use thing, but it happened EVERY time I brushed my teeth. I even tried to slow down and brush more 'gently' and it still happened.So unless you want to risk swallowing a mouth full of bristles, look elsewhere.",
