        "description": "Our Sustainable Bass Toothbrushes offer a gentle and nonabrasive way to keep your mouth, gums and teeth healthy and clean. The way we brush our teeth has an impact on our overall health. The tools we choose to use can make all the difference whether brushing is a health-giving habit or a habit that may cause harm. Statistics show that brushing too hard can lead to: gum recession, loss of enamel and sensitive teeth and gums. That's why we love our Bass toothbrushes. What makes our toothbrushes a wise choice? Better design - the design of our toothbrushes has been clinically proven to effectively reduce gum disease. Better materials - made from BPA-free plastics in the USA. Shorter handle forces us to rethink how we use the toothbrush & spaced out bristle tufts allow for the bristles to wiggle into gum line more effectively, disrupting bacteria that causes gum disease. Rounded bristle tips make sure you are gently massaging gum tissue rather than assaulting sensitive gum tissue. We are also proud to say that by using a Sustainable Bass Toothbrush you are combining function with design and a mission to give back. Functional because of its Bass toothbrush design features: rounded bristle tips, shorter handle, medium-firmness bristles, and (for the Adult 3-row option) spaced out bristle tufts. The Adult size 4-row option and the Junior size 3-row option both have bristle tufts that are closer together. So, they're both great for gently cleaning and polishing the teeth. Sustainable because BrushEco is made of 99.97% biodegradable and compostable materials. Beautiful, well, that's a judgment call. But we find the simple design and sustainable, bamboo construction to be beautiful. Heal and maintain a healthy mouth with our Sustainable Bass toothbrushes.",
