                "reviewText": "As long as I can buy these, I will. I never invested much in regular toothbrushes\u2026 Picked them up at the dollar store. Switched to an electric toothbrush tried it for a while for gum care. Will never use another toothbrush as long as these are available. Teeth are practically as clean as when I leave the dentist office and the bristles feel so good you want to brush longer.",

                "reviewText": "This toothbrush is attractive, great grip and very full brush-head. It arrived well-packaged, and performs excellently as a brushing device. As a flosser, in my use and opinion, not so much.First, because the brush head is so full, and my teeth nicely spaced (not huge gaps between 'em), it is hard, if not impossible, to separate a couple of bristles from the bruh, in order to use as flossing agent. Of course, one must separate the brittles because there is no way to use the entire brush head as a flossing tool--Unless your teeth are each spaced about 1/4\" to 1/2 \" apart.In Im which case, it'll work great, but condolences. Next, the bristles while beautifully soft - and thus a really good brushing tool -- are relatively short. Again, hard to floss w/ a short bristle.Hence my highish rating on the brush itself; lowish rating on the flossing part.As a consumer , I do question the ad on Amazon. What might corporate ethics say about the flossing promises in the ad ? Might the wording be over-stating matters? This I leave to manufacture's wisdom.",
