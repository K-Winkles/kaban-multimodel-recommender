                "reviewText": "I was in search of a new toothbrush after my Fairywill toothbrush stopped working after 3 years of purchasing it. I could not find this, product no longer on Amazon. I decided to give this one a try, after reading the reviews, specs and details of this product.I must say it\u2019s, highly recommended not only this but comparable to the Fairywill electric toothbrush powerful sonic cleaning. One con with Fairywill is that it took the toothbrush a minimum of 4 hours to charge another con is that it only runs for 2 minutes before it turns itself off.Pro for both Fronix and Fairywill is that they both have 40,000 strokes per minute, 5 brushing modes, IPX7 waterproof to name a few.Where the Fronix S5 series Sonic Electric Toothbrush the charging time is literally cut down in half for the charging time by 2 hours, long lasting battery life for 30 days. The only downside for me is that it does not come with a toothbrush head cover, but you can find those easily on Amazon, eBay, or other sites. But it comes in super handy for those who travel, since it comes with a travel case, I also like the feature that it comes with a toothbrush holder, it works similar to the \u201cCommand Strips\u201d all for a reasonable price. Thumbs up from me! Thank you Fronix team!",
