They are all individually packed, unlike other products where you have to keep them inside their bags (thereby creating bulk in your purse).I find that the paste actually tastes good, and once you have placed it in your mouth, it starts performing pretty quickly, although I prefer to wet it a bit before using, as it makes it a bit easier.The floss actually comes attached, and once you remove it, you find the pick. None of the other products have this!! With other products, you need one bag of toothbrushes, and one bag of floss. The only problem is that the floss breaks easily.Customer service is great, I complained about this to them, and they were very professional and are working on improving this feature.Unfortunately, it doesn't have a compartment for mouthwash as well.... that would make this the perfect product.",

                "reviewText": "Sometimes you need more than floss. And usually you arent around your toothbrush when you do. I've put some of these absolutely everywhere. I'm going on a huge trip, and I've stuffed my luggage with these. Nothing like needing to brush your teeth on the plane and not being able to (or wanting to) get your toothbrush out.Toothpaste amount is just right, and foams only a little. Was worried I'd feel like I needed to spit the toothpaste out if I was in a place where I didn't have access to a sink... but it doesn't foam too much, so you don't really have to. Using them dry isn't a problem either... they quickly soften and absorb from your saliva.The floss isn't flimsy, and is thick enough to really get all the stuck food. The pick is super sharp and sturdy... better than an actual toothpick even! You will have a very clean mouth after using it.Only downside is it tastes like minty plastic after you're done.",

Bound to happen in high production. Will definitely buy again.The tooth paste and flavor are tremendous. The quality of the apparatus is excellent with the exception of the floss. 2-3 teeth in and the floss comes out. I\u2019ve used tons of different types of floss sticks and this floss portion was terrible. I\u2019ll try again hoping it was a bad batch.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m a big fan of mini toothbrushes that can be used on the go (without water). I\u2019ve been using Colgate Wisps for years; and while they\u2019re great for freshening up after a meal/coffee, I was looking for a mini brush that would allow me to brush my teeth more thoroughly on the go - something with traditional bristles and toothpaste. These brushes really fit the bill of what I was looking for.Here is what I really like about this product:- Traditional bristled brush - cleans teeth thoroughly- Pre-pasted- Individually packaged - can be thrown in a pocket/purse/backpack (won\u2019t end up covered in lint or whatever else).- Built-in toothpick and flossing tool - it really is a great design, extremely functional.Here is what could be improved:- Toothpaste flavor- it didn\u2019t taste awful, just kinda bitter/bland (no minty taste). The brushing experience would be more pleasant with a fresh minty toothpaste (different flavor options would be awesome).*note: I\u2019ve only purchased these brushes once: it\u2019s possible the bitter taste was an anomaly.- Faulty toothpicks - about 1 in 4 toothpicks breaks when trying to pull the ends of the brush apart (no matter how gentle I am).- Toothpaste foaminess (yes, foaminess is a word - who knew?) - the toothpaste foams up A LOT when brushing. Whether you see this as a positive or negative, likely depends on how you plan to use these brushes. For people like myself who want a quick brush on the go, all that foam is inconvenient because it requires you to spit multiple times (something that is hard to do when driving - which I found out the first time I used one of these brushes).*My solution to the foaminess issue: if I\u2019m in a situation where spitting isn\u2019t ideal, I remove much of the dried paste before brushing (about 2/3). It still foams up enough to clean to my teeth, but not so much that it would be gross to swallow.All in all, I really like this product. The design is perfect. With a couple small improvements to the execution the product could be even better!",
