                "reviewText": "My twin boys love animals and animal based toothbrushes are a great way to encourage them into healthy brushing habits. I love these brushes because the price per toothbrush is excellent. The suction cups are fun for the kids to stick to counter tops. Each toothbrush has a plastic reusable cover over the head for travel. There are two kinds...some of the brushes have ones that just slide on and other brushes will have the kind with two halves that snap together. I prefer the latter for travel purposes. The bristles are very soft...perhaps a bit too soft. My kids tend to chew on the brush heads and they do wear out pretty quickly. But for the price, still worth it.",

These aren\u2019t the best. The bristles flatten and fray really quickly. (Which is fine for me since the girls might get a month of use out of a toothbrush if I\u2019m lucky.) The little suction cups on the bottom come off if they are playing with the toothbrushes (which my girls are). It also seems like a waste to have the covers on all the toothbrushes. They aren\u2019t awful. They work. They are affordable. But they aren\u2019t great. There are definitely better kid toothbrushes.",

The other con is that the rubber in the bottom does not stick, so it's not possible for the toothbrush to stand well. Will not be purchasing in the future.",

                "reviewText": "This is definitely a toddler tooth brush not a kids tooth brush, but that's why I bought it! The suction feature is great too, helps create even more independence in terms of putting it down. I love the variety and multipack. My toddler chews on her brushes the moment I look away so we go through them in a few weeks (3-4 weeks) which is fine because you're supposed to replace your tooth brush monthly anyways. Overall they're soft, cute, fit perfect in a toddler hands, and love the added cover for travel!",
