                "reviewText": "I was using an electric toothbrush but noticed my gum in the front teeth was receding probably because I was pressing too hard. I decided to use a manual ultrasoft bristle toothbrush and tried the Nimbus Extra Soft Toothbrushes first. The Nimbus has tapered tips which probably reaches between the gums better than most but I think it is too fine to remove much plaque. The head of the brush is also much larger than the Curaprox so its more difficult to reach in the back of the mouth.The Curaprox cleans very well and leaves my teeth very smooth almost as good as the nano bristle toothbrushes. The problem with the nano bristle toothbrush is that the brush head seems to be too full or bulky so it doesn't clean in between the teeth well. For surface cleaning it can't be beaten but the Curaprox does that and cleans in between as well so for me it's the best I have found so far.",

I've been using Nimbus about 25 years. 5460 is soft but not quite as soft as Nimbus. 5460 is worth trying out. It is sleek and styled nicer than Nimbus. But i'm brushing for teeth cleaning & gum cleaning: Nimbus is angled a little bit making back teeth-inside sides easier to brush. 5460 is flat. Nimbus has the aprox 12 tiny extended nylon to get just underneath gum line (in my opinion). I noticed 5460 is about 1/8\" shorter bristle length than the Nimbus.",

So I searched for a soft toothbrush and this one is really lovely with dense, soft bristles not hard and scratchy. Feels like I'm brushing my teeth with velvet. It would be good for sensitive teeth. So far, after 6 months use the bristles haven't splayed out like cheap toothbrushes do. Well worth the money.",
