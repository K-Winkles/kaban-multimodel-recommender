However, it came with 10 brushes, a case, everything you would need. I have periodontal disease, so I have lots of plaque buildup. This toothbrush has 5 stages you can go through while brushing. I use the top 4 every time I brush. The gums on one of my teeth have receeded so that I could see the root and it looked black. It now just looks gray - after several months. The first time I went for cleaning they told me I had very little plaque build-up compared to what it had been in the past. So I would say this is a very, good sonic toothbrush and the price was very, very good.",

In the interim I bought the highly rated Oral B Pro 1000. It didn't hold a candle to the MySmile, which is gentler on the gums and does a great job of cleaning (especially if you use the timer). I would definitely buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "I had a difficult time the first week trying to get use to this toothbrush, especially the louder sound and different shaped brush head compared with my old electric brush. Nonetheless, I did not give up and just kept making adjustments to my brushing technique, especially since I needed the sensitive setting. Now I love my brush, especially the time notifications and different available settings to meet my needs. My teeth feel great after brushing. The price was excellent including a nice storage case that I will use when traveling, taking up much less space than my old one. Glad I had the patience to keep on trying to get use to this good brush.",

Regalan estuche de viaje . Y adem\u00e1s tienen redes sociales. Estoy muy feliz. Y siento mi boca y dientes limpios. Para cada 2 minutos aproximadamente. Para recordarte que tienes que hacer el cambio de lado. Genial. :-) .pero otros productos de esta marca si son algo elevados en costo. Compr\u00e9 la pasta en polvo. Sin flour con menta ,y la verdad la uso 1 vez por semana pero es buen producto.",
