I was beyond surprised when I first tried one out of the package, and realized these are probably the best tooth brush's I've used that aren't electric/battery powered.They have a good grip, but where they really shine is the head of the tooth brush. The back has a tongue scraper, which is a cool design, and the bristles are just perfect.I probably won't ever buy any other tooth brush - my son and I both love these.",
