The handle looks and feels like standard plastic, the bristles seem just like the standard plastic bristles found commonly in most store bought toothbrushes. This Tom's toothbrush is particularly harsh on my aging sensitive gums and is/was a total waste of money. Be warned, this toothbrush is garbage and likely harmful to your teeth and gums.
