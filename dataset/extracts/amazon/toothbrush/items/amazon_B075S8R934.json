Mon exp\u00e9rience avec ce produit n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 comme pr\u00e9vu, car la taille de la t\u00eate est petite, pas une taille standard, et la deuxi\u00e8me chose est que l'emballage n'est pas comme indiqu\u00e9 dans un paquet de 6, mais dans 6 brosses \u00e0 dents en paquet unique. Je recommande d'opter pour un pack de 4 (package \u00e9conomique) fourni en t\u00eates standard et normales qui conviennent mieux aux adultes. Cela pourrait \u00eatre un bon choix pour les enfants ou les personnes ayant des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences en mati\u00e8re de petite taille de t\u00eate.",
