                "reviewText": "I love the feel of the bamboo, and I keep both a white and black bristle out for myself. Day and night use, automatically color coded. My protectors also fit over the bristles on these as well. The bristles are not too stiff, they\u2019re soft, and it seems they last longer than the bulky plastic toothbrush bristles. Bamboo doesn\u2019t absorb water, very quick drying, and that\u2019s a huge plus. It seems more antibacterial this way. I\u2019ve used these for years and will continued to buy them. There\u2019s no plastic and slick cardboard waste packaging with these but they are well packaged, simple and nothing unnecessary. I know many people have found uses for the wooden handles after the bristles go \u201cpast it.\u201d I haven\u2019t yet, but I\u2019ll keep thinking of something - gardening stake markers (you can write on them) or painted something, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019ll be something. At least it\u2019s not more plastic to toss into a landfill and I really like that!!",

Generally the wood designed brushes are much more soft bristled than plastic traditional ones, which takes some getting used to for most people and is what I love about them and why I won\u2019t go back to industry standard brushes .. and these are just in the sweet spot of good cleaning firm but soft feel that cleans well, but it\u2019s like something on their machine that makes the bristles the very tips of the brush felt sharp like it was micro cutting my gums at first until I got used to it or they wore in after about 10 uses ..They are fine brushes but I\u2019ll be trying another brand after I make it through this big box",

Final Edit: I contacted the company to see if i could get a replacement or a discount for a replacement just for the toothbrush holder, and I ended up getting a replacement for the whole set a few days later!!!! Amazing customer service!Edit: I ordered a second time about a year and a half later. This one arrived with a broken toothbrush holder. There was a Crack right down the middle of one side. I know this brand makes great quality products, but I'm disappointed my second time ordering came with broken product.Original review for first time ordering:All of the contents are in a small paper box.As described, all came: -4 brushes. - 1 floss tube. - 1 travel case. Each toothbrush is in an individual box within the package. The floss bottle I recieved did come as pictured, with a hole and blade on the lid. It actually came threaded already, which was super helpful. I have seen some reviews that said otherwise, but mine did indeed came as picturedThe travel case had a tight lid, so you will not have to worry that your toothbrush will fall out if it is in your backpack.The bristles are super soft, and the bamboo is very smooth. There are leaf images on each brush. There is a different number of leaves on each brush so you can easy get this for household and not be confused on whose is whose, since you can identify the different number of leaf images on your brush.",

W\u00e4hrend dieses Zeitraums wurden verschiedene Aspekte wie Haltbarkeit, Benutzerfreundlichkeit und Nachhaltigkeit bewertet.Eine der bemerkenswertesten Eigenschaften der Greenzla Bambus Zahnb\u00fcrsten ist ihre Haltbarkeit. Selbst nach mehreren Monaten intensiver Verwendung wiesen die Borsten keine signifikante Abnutzung auf. Dies zeigt, dass die Zahnb\u00fcrsten eine langanhaltende L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr die Zahnpflege bieten.Die Benutzerfreundlichkeit der Zahnb\u00fcrsten wurde ebenfalls positiv bewertet. Die B\u00fcrsten liegen angenehm in der Hand und erm\u00f6glichen eine gr\u00fcndliche Reinigung von Z\u00e4hnen und Zahnfleisch. Die Bambusgriffe f\u00fchlen sich nat\u00fcrlich an und sind rutschfest.Fazit:Nach monatelangem Gebrauch k\u00f6nnen wir feststellen, dass die Greenzla Bambus Zahnb\u00fcrsten eine hervorragende Wahl f\u00fcr umweltbewusste Verbraucher sind. Sie bieten nicht nur eine hohe Haltbarkeit und Benutzerfreundlichkeit, sondern auch den Vorteil der Nachhaltigkeit.

Adem\u00e1s, cada cepillo est\u00e1 numerado para que su identificaci\u00f3n sea m\u00e1s sencilla.\u2022 La dureza de los cepillos es blanda, lo que ayuda a evitar el desgaste del esmalte de los dientes. Estoy acostumbrada a cepillos un poco menos suaves (de dureza media), pero el cambio no es desagradable.\u2022 Hay que tener un especial cuidado en cuanto a su conservaci\u00f3n y secar bien el cepillo despu\u00e9s de cada uso, ya que el bamb\u00fa tiende a enmohecerse si permanece h\u00famedo mucho tiempo.A pesar de que no son tan c\u00f3modos como un cepillo de pl\u00e1stico ergon\u00f3mico, los beneficios que ofrecen (sobre todo en el \u00e1mbito de reducir el da\u00f1o a la naturaleza) son suficientes como para que merezca la pena pasarse a ellos, al menos, en nuestro caso.100% recomendables.",
