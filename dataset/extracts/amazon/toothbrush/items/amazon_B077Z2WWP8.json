                "reviewText": "I was in dire need of a new toothbrush. I was probably six months overdue for one but I kept putting it off, because I hated the idea of throwing my plastic one in the garbage. I was debating on getting those battery operated ones but knew the plastic waste would be just as bad. I brushed off the idea of a bamboo toothbrush for so long because I figured they wouldn't work well. I was wrong.First off, the bristles are soft. But I was so in need of a new toothbrush that the first time I used the bamboo one, my gums bled a little bit in some areas. My guess is the bristles were so done on my old toothbrush that the new, straight bristles really jostled my gums. But it was in a good way - it felt like I was really getting everything nice and cleaned out. The second thing I noticed was that the feel of bamboo against my mouth as I'm brushing is fairly unpleasant. I didn't think it would be a huge deal but it really took some getting used to. I have some lip vaseline so I decided to rub that on the back of the toothbrush and it help it glide more while I brushed.I'd say so far I'm happy that these are an alternative to plastic brushes. And they are really affordable! For $7, I get enough toothbrushes for the year. I like that they are numbered in case you need to give somebody one. The packaging isn't wasteful or overkill - I can't stand when companies use super nice, over-the-top packing for something that is just going to go in the trash. Sure, it's \"luxe\" and looks great for unboxing videos, but for the general population, I don't need anything that extra. So the simplicity of this company's packaging was really refreshing.My teeth look cleaner after brushing with these. Again, part of that was due to the fact that my old toothbrush was dead. But it's good to know that these will get rid of just as much stuff as any other brush. It's only a $7 gamble so I'd say go for it and give these a shot. I'm not sure how \"hygienic\" putting a swipe of vaseline on the back of the brush is, but I'd give it a try if you don't like the feeling right away.",

                "reviewText": "Decided to give these a try over my candy-colored expensive toothbrush from the typical toothpaste manufacturers. I always thought their medium-bristles, pointed in all directions, and funky shaped handles would give you the best clean. But I frequently had bleeding gums from the medium bristles. My dentist always tells me to get soft bristled brushes, and I found these.Been using one of these a week now. Have to say I'm impressed. The bristles are very soft and gentle, yet clean just as well as my previous brushes. Haven't had any issues with my gums. The handle is easy to hold and so light weight. It hasn't fallen apart in my hands or left me with splinters. I figure even if I get a month out of each brush, using these will still be less expensive than my previous brushes, and less plastic waste that goes into the trash. Great toothbrushes to take on travel because if you lose it, no big deal.So I'm happy with these. I even gave a few away to some friends for them to try after telling them about the brushes. I'll be ordering more and happy to recommend them to others.",
