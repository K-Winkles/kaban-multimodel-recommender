Yes, this is how I sometimes spend my weekends when traveling alone to Godforsaken places.I had never seen these before but wow, it was the clear winner in the end. It felt funky at first with the large head size and thick handle but it was actually very ergonomic and easy in the hand. This was the absolutely winner in the \"my teeth feel clean\" contest and when I'm on the road, these are the only kind I use. They are soft but long-lasting, come in a variety of colors and seem to be more effective and really brushing your teeth to the finest.I haven't seen them in too many retail outlets and when I shout out my job when I do I get a lot of eye-rolling from others but give it a try, it's not a big investment and it's a fantastic toothbrush you will use every day.",

                "reviewText": "These are the best toothbrushes on the market. They are wide enough to not only clean your teeth but massage your gums at the same time. Also because of the width they hold their shape and do not need to be replaced near as often. The bristles are flexible enough to thoroughly cover each tooth and not feel rough on your gum area. Rather than throw them away when they have reached their peak usage, I soak them in peroxide and they are just like new. My whole mouth feels tingly clean. Then when I am ready to replace it after about one year I use them for cleaning shower stall tracking and window sill tracking. Also because you can purchase for left or right handed brushing they are very easy to use and twist for the right positioning in your whole mouth. Really I can't say enough good things about these toothbrushes. I'd never go back again to the old style.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using these toothbrushes for about 20 years now. I would have a hard time if I had to go back to using \"regular\" toothbrushes.They last much longer than other toothbrushes and just make my mouth feel so much cleaner and fresher because you're brushing your gums along with your teeth. :) The bristles are nice and soft so they don't make your gums bleed but not too soft that they don't brush your teeth well.I used to use the original ones but now only get the Scuba because the grip is better when your hand is wet.I'd definitely recommend these toothbrushes to everyone!! You won't be disappointed!They are pricier than the toothbrushes you get at your local store but really, you'd probably have to replace those 3 times before you'd have to replace one of these so there really is no price difference.",
