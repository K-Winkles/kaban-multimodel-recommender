                "reviewText": "Periodontist recommended \"ultra soft\" tooth brushes for better cleaning. First time using these I noticed that they were much gentler on my gums than even the \"soft\" brushes from the major brands. I could tell from feeling my teeth with my tongue that they were smoother after brushing with these. After a couple months, even my dentist noticed that my teeth were cleaner and gums showed less physical trauma from brushing. I think everyone should be using these, and all the manufacturers should be making these in volume, to bring the price down. I think Colgate has their version, but it costs a lot more than their high volume models.",

                "reviewText": "I used manual tooth brushes for years. They were hurting my gums badly, to the point I hated to brush my teeth. Then at my last dental visit I was given a new tooth brush. When I used it it was much softer than my regular brushes. So I started looking for soft brushes on Amazon, and reading reviews. I came upon these brushes, and went ahead and placed my order. No sooner than I received them I started using them. Oh the softness of this brush against my teeth and gums was nothing less than transformative. Now I brush 3 or 4 times a day, or whenever I eat anything. I bought these for all members of my family. Happy family here again. Oh BTW, if your current tooth brush is making you hesitate to brush your teeth thoroughly, decay will start and with time you may require teeth implants, at $3000 to $5000 each, check it out at your dentist. Experience talks here.",

Now that I have used these, I cannot go back to the \u201csoft\u201d kind in a normal store. What is considered to be soft in a normal store is still much rougher than these. I have now stock piled these things and plan to use only them going forward. I would highly recommend these to anyone with sensitive gums.",

It doesn't matter if they claim to be extra soft, super soft etc. I even tried to buy baby toothbrushes, but same thing medium. These are perfect. They don't damage your gums at all. But still get your teeth clean. I would barely scrub with my old toothbrushes at all, so as to save wear on my gums. These will definitely let me brush more often and longer.",
