                "reviewText": "Bought it cause I get hand cramps using the toothbrushes that my family buys from Costco for some reason. So I decided to just buy this one because why not, looked unique and made me feel better about myself because i\u2019m not wasting as much plastic by replacing a whole brush every few months. Instead now i\u2019m using replaceable heads, and a permanent aluminum body. The aluminum handle is a game changer to me since I like the weight it adds. Hand cramps still there, but that might just be a me problem that I cant fix. The aluminum body and weight on it makes me feel ELEGANT AND FANCY. Makes me want to use it after every meal rather than just in the morning and before bed like I used too. If you have the money to upgrade to this toothbrush, I say do it. But I would say if the price is a problem just get a different cheaper plastic brush. At the end of the day its just a fancier manual toothbrush.",

                "reviewText": "I HATE brushing my teeth. I always have. I dread it every time. It\u2019s so uncomfortable. So I did two things today: different toothpaste (the other one just was really burny and not the nicest feeling) and bought this bad boy. Man, this toothbrush feels LUXURIOUS. Usually I can\u2019t wait for it to be over and don\u2019t brush for my full 2 mins but I think I accidentally did like 3 mins this morning because I was so amazed by how much it didn\u2019t suck brushing my teeth.I feel like a loser because literally all day I\u2019ve been waiting to brush my teeth again with my fancy toothbrush. The handle is heavy (which I like) and it feels expensive. The packaging was also all paper instead of plastic. My teeth were literally squeaky clean if I rubbed a finger on them so don\u2019t worry about the bristles being too soft to be effective or something.anyway I love this thing I\u2019m excited to go home and brush my teeth. buy this stupid toothbrush so u can brag to ur friends about ur dumb, fancy toothbrush too.",
