They are HARD for sure. Maybe they received the wrong softness or firmness, but I can say the ones I received are hard. My dentist could not find a problem with my gums because they clean so well. And it has been several months since owning these and they are still as firm as new. The box of 6 that I purchased will last more than a year based on how well they are holding up. The reach is great also as I am able to get well into the teeth in the back of my mouth. I'm very satisfied with these and the price was great also.",

                "reviewText": "If this brush is too harsh for you, you might want to consider visiting the dentist or upping your oral hygiene regimen. It's kind of like a new nylon scrub towel when it first comes out of the package - kinda rough but oh so invigorating, and in short time, leaves you with an ultra clean scrubbed feeling. My gums are in the best health they've been in in a long time, light pink and strong. No aches or sensitivity after sweets and extreme temperatures. Using this brush has improved my overall oral health, and I'm absolutely thrilled.The brush is also very attractive if you've got a natural scheme going on in your bathroom. I've used my brush for over 2 months now and only lost 1 bristle in the first week, still holding up extremely well. Highly recommend, and wish I needed to buy more cuz I'd hate to see for this product to go away. With care, you can make these brushes last a good while. Enjoy them!",

They also work well for cleaning my retainer. I have also dedicated a few of them as a dry cleaning and dusting tool for those hard to reach corners. It is also a plus for me that they are made of bamboo and not plastic. Bristles are soft--not hard like advertised.",

Imagine how dental hygienists \u201cscrape\u201d the teeth! Hard bristles are not likely to do damage and do a better cleaning, hence less need for dental hygienist visits. Provided of course people can tolerate it on the gums. However, with use, the tolerance should improve. Do dentists have another motive for suggesting soft brushes\u2026..?",
