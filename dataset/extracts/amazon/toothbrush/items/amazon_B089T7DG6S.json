                "reviewText": "First time buying biodegradable brush and i have mixed feeling.The good:The bristles are very soft. Softer than any other brush i had before.It looks very good with its bamboo handleIt's environmentally friendlyThe bad:The bristles are loose and every second of third brushing, one will get pull out above the others and irritates in the mouth. You can trim it but then few days later, it will happen again. They need better glue.When wet, the handle will stain white countertop. If say, be careful with marble.",
