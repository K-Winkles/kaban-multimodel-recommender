The bristles are nice and medium, like I like. I tried the tongue scrapper, but I probably won't use it consistently. It's good to know it's there though.One brush was missing the cap, but I let that slide since I don't intend on traveling with it. I'd honestly only need one anyway. The bag is a resealable Ziplock style. The colors are kind of feminine, all light shades of blue, aqua, green, grey, purple and orange. I won't want to use these around my guy buddies.Overall, you can't beat the value at ~67 cents per.",

I do not tend to have sensitive gums but when I brush with these like I do normally, my gums bleed. Would not recommend for someone who has sensitive gums. Also, only 4 toothbrushes come with a cover, not all of them.",
