                "reviewText": "Well, where do I even start with this so-called \"PERECT\" electric toothbrush? Let's see, it comes with eight replacement heads but dies after just six months, so you won't even get to use all of them. But hey, at least you have eight useless heads to stare at while you mourn the loss of your electric toothbrush.And let's talk about those five useless modes, shall we? Because who doesn't love making brushing their teeth more complicated than it needs to be? I mean, who doesn't want to spend an extra five minutes trying to figure out which mode is the best one to use? Oh, and don't forget that one mode is enough, but let's just throw in a bunch of extra ones to confuse you anyway.And don't even get me started on the vibration. Apparently, this toothbrush is more of a vibrator than an actual toothbrush according to other comments. Fantastic. So not only did you waste $18 on a toothbrush that died after six months, but you also now have a heavy, useless, vibrating paperweight that does nothing but make your hand numb.I'm sure you're thrilled with your purchase and just can't wait to throw more money at this company for their amazing products. But if you're anything like me, you probably just want your money back and a real toothbrush that actually works. But hey, at least you got those eight replacement heads, right? Just in case you decide to buy another one of these toothbrushes that will inevitably die on you again.",

                "reviewText": "I got this inexpensive electric toothbrush for my son who is starting to show much more interest in our Philips Sonicare toothbrushes. He used to be scared of the vibrations and I never pushed him but now he wants to use mine, so I decided it\u2019s time to get him his own.Black is his favorite color so I figured this would be a good option.This toothbrush comes equipped with five cleaning modes that you can choose from and three levels of LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH intensity. My 5yo is only using LOW for now, the low noise is a plus because it keeps him from getting anxious. The modes are Gentle, Clean, White, Polishing, Novice. Each mode has a different pulsation/vibration pattern. My son is using Gentle mode at the lowest setting.The soft bristles are tough and flexible and have excellent elasticity. It includes eight replacement brush heads which can last us a long time!",
