Its bristles are designed to be gentle on sensitive teeth and gums. Its head is specially designed to provide effective cleaning even in the hard to clean areas. For effective cleaning of your teeth and gums we recommend twice daily brushing with a fluoride toothpaste. *With twice daily use What is Tooth Sensitivity? Sensitivity is the short, sharp pain experienced when eating or drinking something cold, hot, sweet, sour or spicy. This is because of exposed dentine \u2013 the inner core of the tooth surrounding the nerve. This can lead to other problems if not treated. What Causes Sensitive Teeth? Dentinal hypersensitivity, or tooth sensitivity, is a common dental problem. It\u2019s a condition that can develop over time, as a result of common problems such as receding gums and enamel wear. Most sufferers are between 20 and 50 years old. Tooth sensitivity can start to happen when the softer, inner part of the tooth called \u2018dentine\u2019 becomes exposed. Dentine lies under the enamel and the gums.

The ovalish heads are semi-compact, and the bristles are soft on a slight firmer side. They look good, feel good, and I like them a lot.They're made in India which passed China in population and is the world's largest democracy (no particular relevance...just trivia...and seems poised to unseat China as the World's Factory). Priced lower than any I've seen...six for $6.16, or $1.03 a piece! I usually \"stretch\" the use of my toothbrushes until the bristles look \"iffy.\" But no more! I'll just swap them out monthly...I can afford a buck a month...\u30c4",

Within a few weeks, the bristles were falling out and the center of the brush seems to have caved inward making the center of the brush useless. I certainly expected more from the Sensodyne brand. I won't be purchasing these again. Go to your local pharmacy and just buy a name brand off the shelf--it will probably last longer than these did.",

This is not an issue for me, they are half the price of UK toothbrushes and good quality. Slightly larger head than a UK Sensodyne brush, but lovely soft bristles, so not a problem. My whole family prefers them, and we will be buying more.",
