                "reviewText": "Without a doubt this is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. The size of the toothbrush head is perfect for brushing teeth as the bristles (soft) move across the enamel of each tooth removing any debris. I also like that I can position the brush head on the front of my teeth to brush both the top and bottom teeth at the same time as a final sweep as I complete the brushing. I find it doesn't matter if I am just getting up in the morning or I have completed a meal, this toothbrush leaves my mouth feeling clean and polished. The design of the handle makes it very easy to hold and manipulate the bristles as I brush my teeth. I also purchased the carrying case for the toothbrush which works well for travel, and provides a safe place to store my toothbrush while it dries (can lay it open easily on a counter or keep it shut with the air holes allowing the bristles to dry). I highly recommend this toothbrush!",

I\u2019ve tried Radius replaceable head toothbrush (it traps a lot of gook between the sections). The travel toothbrush is ok but flimsy. This a fixed toothbrush gives you a good clean and the case keeps your toothbrush of hotel counters which is a major plus for me. The toothbrush itself is solid hard plastic, with a smooth durable feel to it. The bristles are soft and won\u2019t hurt your gums. I get a good clean while using this toothbrush. Very satisfied with my purchase. I would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried many brands and types of toothbrushes. I have found this one to be the best. It is superior to all the rest. This toothbrush is not junk from China. This is a high-quality engineered toothbrush Made in the USA in Pennsylvania. This toothbrush cleans and massages much better than others due in part to the extremely high bristle density and relatively large, but very comfortable head. It lasts a very long time compared to other toothbrushes. The handle has a very intelligent ergonomic design that enables superior cleaning, grip, control, fit, reach, and coverage. The product is BPA free. Two models are available - one for right-handed users and one for left-handed users. I have been using this brand for several years. I use no other. When I have a routine cleaning at the dentist's office, the hygienist and dentist always remark that my teeth are very clean, white, and bright. If you use one of these you probably will decide to use no other toothbrush. If I were a NASA astronaut preparing for residency on the International Space Station for 6 months, I would want 3 or 4 of these toothbrushes in my personal kit. For details and information about this toothbrush, check out the manufacturer's excellent web site with videos. RadiusToothBrush dot com P.S. I have no affiliation with Radius except as a consumer.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using RADIUS toothbrushes for years! These are a new design where the handle has the same shape but the actual brush part is replaceable. Having just gotten a set of 3 with this new design it will be awhile before I'll need new brushes but I'm betting they will work and last as long as the original ones did. I've been using this new design for only a few weeks but so far after every use when I rinse the brush and check the bristles they look like they did when I first opened the package. There are no bent bristles or any sort of distortion that I can see. If you need a new toothbrush, I have no hesitation in recommending these.",
