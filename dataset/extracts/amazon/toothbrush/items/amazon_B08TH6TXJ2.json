                "reviewText": "I was skeptical because these are not \"silko\" brand but I ordered anyway. We needed new toothbrushes anyway and the price was right. These toothbrushes are so soft. To touch them they feel soft like petting a soft cat, I can't think of anything else to compare the softness to. And brushing with it, there was no pain brushing and no bleeding from my gums. I like soft bristle toothbrushes anyway. But this was even softer. And after I finished brushing, my teeth are whiter. I feel cleaner. That cleaner feeling may be due to the fact that because the brush was so soft and no pain I brushed for a longer time. I used to be a dental assistant and in many of the CE courses (continuing education), that your required to take yearly as a dental assistant, it was mentioned that a soft bristle toothbrush is recommended. If brushing is not painful it will promote better brushing habits. And soft bristle is better for gum tissue. So I LOVE this toothbrush, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",

                "reviewText": "First day using it after getting it, it is a bit bulky for my tastes but that was my own fault for not reading the description. A bit of warning for those of you you are texture sensitive like myself, it does feel very odd at first, kinda like brushing your teeth with toilet paper, but it\u2019s something I think I can get used to. It definitely is very soft and gave the outside a nice scrub that took off the gunk very easily. I don\u2019t think it does too well for deep in the grooves so just make sure to floss very well. It also is so incredibly thick that I had a tough time getting rid of all water out of it after I was done, having to squeeze the brush to get it out. I was worried the grip was gonna be too slippery as it looked very shiny and too smooth in the picture, but it holds very well in your hand and doesn\u2019t slip at all. I can\u2019t speak for any whitening effects yet but it definitely seems worth the buy so far.",

                "reviewText": "I am a certified dental assistant and i can reassure you these toothbrushes do NOT clean your teeth. The bristles are too soft to be abrasive enough to clean plaque or tarter from your teeth. and the amount of bristles on the brush are so many and so compact that they do not spread to clean in between the teeth. had bad breath after 2 days use. do not buy.",
