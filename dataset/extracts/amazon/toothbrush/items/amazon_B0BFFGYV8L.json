                "reviewText": "The tooth brush really deserves 5 stars but I gave it 4 for personal reasons and thats that I would like harder brissels on the toothbrush heads but see that is just me some people like softer. Also the case is a little flimsy . Other then that this toothbrush is really really nice. I charged it once and id say 8-10 brushes later and its still on full battery life. The color is really cool the blue and gold look really nice like way nicer then the Panasonic one I had that was just white and green. The feel is heavy and the toothbrush really is the same as the Panasonic which I paid almost 100 dollars for. It came with a bunch of heads which is great that I dont have to buy them for a while. I wish the case was nicer but I mean cmon im really being greedy wanting a nice case for 38 dollars I got so much with this toothbrush. Overall im really happy ill probably get a few as Christmas gifts for people because I feel like it will make a great gift and you cant go wrong with the price . I like the 2 minute timer it has because it keeps me in check cause without a timer ill dangerously brush my teeth for way too long and that can make them worse by removing importantly needed natural coatings on your teeth . It really buzzes fast and does a good job on making your mouth feel clean when your done brushing . If my opinion means anything which really it dont lol but if it does to anyone I definitely recommend this and can say its a good buy for the money .",

It\u2019s tricky to navigate the bottom part of the toothbrush but you do that by pressing the power button several times. The area will light up showing you what level you\u2019re on such as sensitive, massage or whitening (not to sure on whitening, only time will tell). Also, you don\u2019t have to use a lot of toothpaste and it cleans your teeth quickly. Be careful not to get it too close to your gums because it can/and will irritate them. The best purchase for your teeth!",

                "reviewText": "This toothbrush is the best I\u2019ve tried so far, and I\u2019ve tried about 5 different electric toothbrushes over the past few years. My last toothbrush was a sore disappointment, partly my own fault. My wife loves very soft bristles, and has sensitive teeth/gums, and she loved it, so I thought I\u2019d give it a try. It barely felt like my teeth were getting cleaned, even after scrubbing them while the tooth brush was trying to clean. THIS tooth brush on the other hand has PLENTY of power. I use it on the most powerful setting and I ALMOST want to use the next setting down. My teeth feel like I just got them polished at the dentist\u2019s office and I don\u2019t have to press hard or scrub to get them feeling that way! The toothbrush head is smaller than a normal toothbrush head, and at first that was weird, but in less than a week I got used to it, and now I like it because it\u2019s easier to maneuver around and get everywhere clean. Also, I tested out the safety feature where it cuts out if you press too hard. I feel like it worked perfectly. I was able to get it to trigger without have to put a ton of pressure on it, but I can still put enough pressure to where if I needed to do some scrubbing, I would be able to just fine. And it doesn\u2019t completely shut the toothbrush off like I thought it would. It just cuts off the vibration while it\u2019s being pressed, and as soon as you release the pressure, it continues brushing.The only thing I\u2019m not a huge fan of, but again I\u2019m already starting to get used to, is the handle is a bit larger than most electric tooth brushes I\u2019ve used. But it\u2019s not cumbersome or anything, so not a huge deal.Overall, I am very happy with this toothbrush and it\u2019s been one of the better purchases I\u2019ve made recently! Highly recommended!",

As you get used to the shape it becomes easier to wield and you can put it on softer setting while you get used to it.",
