I've been using a Spinbrush for years - really gets into all the nooks and crannies - but this brush just hummed over my teeth and left gunk behind along the gum line. The only good thing I did like was that it gives your gums a pleasant massage. I'll keep it for that reason, but I did order another Spinbrush.",
