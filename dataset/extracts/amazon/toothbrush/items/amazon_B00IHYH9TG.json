Yes, the packaging words are in Chinese. The recipients of these won't care what the language is as I bought them for mission projects (most toothbrushes are made in China). They are individually wrapped - easy to separate. The toothbrushes I used to order on Amazon are no longer available -- so these were my next choice. I wish the seller would update the information/description so buyers knew what they were buying. I do like the style of these - and the colors.",
