This little brush is great in that it doesn't trigger the gag reflex like a normal toothbrush does, for whatever reason, so I can actually brush all the problem areas properly.The bristles are stiffer than I expected, and I'm not sure if it's from my inability to properly brush the areas or the stiffness of the bristles - I'm inclined to think the former instead of the latter - but it did make my gums bleed the first few days. Be gentler with this brush than your usual one, maybe.",
