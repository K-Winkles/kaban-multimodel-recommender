            "[Sonic Vibration] kingeroes C2PRO electric toothbrush adopts the latest sonic vibration technology. The metal shaft generates the vibration force. The vibration frequency can reach up to 42,000 times per minute. It can effectively remove plaque, whiten teeth and improve oral health. It produces vibrations like the sound of a sports car, rather than the tractor-like sound of a normal plastic shaft.",
            "[4 Modes] The 4 modes it offers are clean, whiten, soft, and super. You can select several modes based on your preferences. The forces and modes of vibration in each mode vary. Each light denotes a certain mode, and the super mode is indicated when the lights for the clean, whiten, and soften modes continue to flash.",
            "[Ultra-long Standby Time] It has a 60-day operating period after being fully charged. You don't need to charge it frequently because rapid charging is supported. Moreover, the kit includes a travel case. It is quite convenient that you may bring it along with you when you travel.",
            "[Replacement of Brush Head] As the set comes with 8 brush heads, you won't need to buy the head too often. Please remember to check the brush head's airtight pouch before using it to see if it is open. To prevent reselling, each of our brush heads is individually wrapped. The bristles, however, could distort while being transported. It will regain its former shape within 15 seconds in warm water above 50 degrees, so there is no need to be concerned.",

                "reviewText": "This toothbrush is compact but packs some power! I can only use mine on the gentle setting, but I feel like the electric toothbrush really has been helping to keep my teeth clean. It has a two-minute timer, so you know when you have brushed for long enough. I find the shape of the toothbrush handle to be ergonomic, and the toothbrush heads are comfortable and gentle on the teeth. I have been pretty pleased with my experience. I chose this toothbrush for its affordability and the fact that it comes with a case and many replacement heads. The hard case is great for traveling, and the case can hold the toothbrush handle as well as two heads.I've been using my toothbrush for a while, and I've only had to charge it once. Unfortunately, it just outright died without an indicator, but since I don't have to frequently charge it is fine. Also, take note that you cannot stand it up while it is charging, since the port is on the bottom base of the toothbrush. Other than that, I have no complaints. If this item had the features of a battery life indicator and the charging port being low on the side, this would be a five-star rating.TLDR: I recommend this electric toothbrush to anyone curious about trying one or seeking a replacement. It has worked without issue and comes with many replacement heads, as well as a hard case for travel. The ergonomic handle, soft brush head, and various settings ensure you can deep clean your teeth without sacrificing comfort. Just be sure to charge it on occasion, as there is no battery indicator.Thanks for reading and I hope this was helpful!",

                "reviewText": "Listen, i never write reviews until I've had a chance to use the product for a while. This is one of the worst electric toothbrushes I've owned. Scratch that. THE worst.Is it sleek and pretty? Yes. That is where the positives stop.You constantly have to rotate the brush head so that the bristles actually spin. If you don't, imagine taking the soft pad of your fingers and lightly grazing your teeth. Even if you get the brush head just right and finish your cleaning, the second you put your toothbrush down again, you must start the delicate arrangement of repositioning the brush head again.I thought, ok, maybe i got a bum brush head. Let me try a new one. Nope, not it. Same deal with the second one.I've had this toothbrush for 2 months and now the latest thing is that it stops after 30 seconds, despite being fully charged. Which i could tolerate if i could then turn it back on. Nope. Pressing the on button button does nothing. The only thing that helps is charging (again). Imagine having to top of your gas tank every time you've driven 5 miles. Same deal.This is a piece of garbage. Save your money.",
