                "reviewText": "I've never had an electric toothbrush before even though my dentist has hounded me to get one. Bought this one because the price was right for me to do a trial run. I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised! The cleaning function that tells you when to move to a different section of your mouth was nice. I also like that it keeps your settings each time after you use it. The extra brush heads are definitely a plus! Only downfall was the case being a little hard to open. Definitely not a deal breaker. If you want something at a lower price that's easy to use, this is definitely worth it.",

                "reviewText": "Great cleaning\u2026like coming straight from the dentist. The packaging was nice, the toothbrush comes plenty of extra replacement heads. Has a charging stand. Multiple settings for different purposes, such as whitening, gum massaging, cleaning. It is gentle yet effective. And another nice perk is that it is not loud like many other electric toothbrushes. Great deal, highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I was first impressed with all the extra brush heads, it came with 8! The quality of the product is nice, durable, and doesn\u2019t feel cheap. Adjusting the intensity of the brush level is needed, as the lowest level is just fine and the higher level is a little intense. It also has different modes and brushes all the teeth surfaces and gets the back, hard to reach spots. The only critique I have is the plastic case is a little hard to open. All in all it was a great product for the sale price I got it for!",
