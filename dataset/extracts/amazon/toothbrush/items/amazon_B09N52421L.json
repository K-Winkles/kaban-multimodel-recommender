There\u2019s just some minor annoyances I can\u2019t get over. It apparently has a built-in timer I didn\u2019t read anything about in the description. Every 30-seconds it shuts off for several seconds, which is supposed to indicate it\u2019s time to move to another quadrant. Then at 2 minutes it shuts off completely. Super annoying.And then the brush head just vibrates. Don\u2019t get me wrong, my teeth feel really clean after, and I can\u2019t say it does a bad job. But I can\u2019t get the idea that an actual moving brush head would be better.I haven\u2019t used the water pick or tongue scraper so I can\u2019t verify any of that, but I did mess with the dial and it turned on and blew air at me. Seems like something I would probably enjoy.Overall, it seems to be really good quality and I can\u2019t fault it for what it is.",

                "reviewText": "So the first thing I actually thought this was a Philips sonic and this is how the company fools you because they put aqua sonic in the name. Am I impressed with a brush? Heck yeah it\u2019s actually just as good as a Philips sonic it\u2019s got four settings and I usually leave mine on whitening. I\u2019ll probably try the other three later on down the road but for now all I care is about wine in my teeth. Now the downfall of this particular product is the water fossler, it is built poorly because of the extended cable that isn\u2019t flexible and when you turn it to clean the water jets all over the place as you can see on one of the photos I have provided. It also didn\u2019t work properly the first time around and for whatever reason it\u2019s working correctly now but I have noticed that I have to fill the tank almost every day now that it\u2019s working properly because of the amount of water it shoots out I even turned the knob down so that shoots out slower but it\u2019s still messy. This is the most messy water fossler I\u2019ve ever had.I would\u2019ve given this five stars but that is the only downfall this particular product. I do like how they provide more brush heads and fossler options Than Philip sonic does and it\u2019s a good bargain for the price I ended up paying $70 it was on sale and I like the brush that it\u2019s black it looks way better than that traditional white brush.",

                "reviewText": "My previous water flosser, the brand leader, developed a leaky line. I also wanted to get an electric toothbrush, having previously owned a brand leader that died long ago. As I was looking into brand leaders for both, and for combo units, I came across AquaSonic. What stood out for me was the cost of toothbrushes. That's where the brand leaders really get you. So not only did the AquaSonic cost less on the initial purchase, I expect its lifetime cost of ownership to be less. The flosser works well, and is MUCH quieter than my previous flosser. It's also more powerful, which took some getting used to. I use it now on the lowest or second lowest setting. Maybe I'll be able to increase that over time. The toothbrush works quite well. I was used to the round brush with circular cleaning motion of the brand leader, so the sonic action of this model was new for me. But after a couple of days I got used to it. One thing that I found a bit annoying is that the buttons are easy to accidentally press while you are brushing, thus turning it off or changing the brushing mode. Recessed buttons or some contour of the handle would have prevented this. I've adapted to it by holding the brush at the very bottom so my hands aren't near the buttons. Comes with five identical brushes, two waterpicks (why not five?), and a tongue cleaner. But, there's no colour coding. I'm not sharing this unit with anyone so it's not an issue for me. But for a couple it's a bit inconvenient, especially since popping the toothbrush off takes a bit of effort -- unlike the flosser which has an eject button. I also worry about the durability of the water line for the flosser. There's no strain relieve on it so I suspect it will crack and leak after a few years of use, same as my old brand-leader flosser.",
