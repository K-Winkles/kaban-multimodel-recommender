It has \"fine\" (i.e., slender and strong) bristles, which if you can find a regular toothbrush - that's the way to go. Gets the tartar off as much as can be expected between your teeth.. The only drawback is: it is not fully \"protected.\" I.E., the fold-in aspect allows for possible stuff to get in. So far, none has. But if they modified this feature, this would be as good as the toothbrush in my bathroom.",

I previously used an oral B electric toothbrush. I was surprised at how sensitive my gums were when I started using this toothbrush, so it is definitely doing something my oral B wasn\u2019t. I can feel the longer bristles going in between my teeth and even though all the bristles are so soft, my mouth feels cleaner than ever. I don\u2019t think I can ever go back to anything else.",

                "reviewText": "I was confused because I thought the bristles were silicone or rubber but they are sort of like regular toothbrush bristles. The \"flossing\" part is they are extra thin on the end so they will easily go between teeth. Thumbs up on that. The folding part is cool. Not totally enclosed so I think it'll try quickly and hopefully the anti-bac part is true. That's the important part. All in all it seems really good for traveling and I would recommend it.",
