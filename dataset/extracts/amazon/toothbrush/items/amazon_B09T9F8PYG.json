                "reviewText": "This is very good value for money. The cost alone is worth the replacement heads. The handle has a satin finish which is easy to grip, and the heads assemble to the body (important to read the instructions as they sort of twist and clip on) with minimal, if any, gap. I was looking for an \"ultrasonic\" toothbrush as the Oral-B type I have had for ages just didn't seem to be doing much simply spinning a few degrees back and forth. Ultrasonic, to me, means the sort of frequencies you cannot hear, and the type used in the ultrasonic cleaners. This isn't quite that, but it is still very much higher than a regular electric toothbrush and placing the bristles in some water it is clear from the ripples it is very much like that of the ultrasonic cleaners. The bristles seem just right in that they are soft so it doesn't feel like you are damaging the gum line, yet not too soft that it feels like they aren't doing anything. Overall, very pleased with the design and performance of this toothbrush.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this electric toothbrush as a replacement for an old battery operated one I've had for several years. I like electric toothbrushes but have no plug in to keep them charged. These are perfect as I can charge when needed and the battery life seems excellent. There is good power for cleaning and has a timer for so much time for each quadrant of your mouth. It also comes with a plastic base which holds the toothbrush upright while not in use, convenient. The timer function works well but mine came assembled with extra heads which is nice , and it seems that the buttons are on the outside of the toothbrush where your fingers would rest while brushing and several times I have turned it off because of this. I should peruse it a little more and see if the head could be reversed. I would recommend this toothbrush as compared to a plug in toothbrush and if you have limited electric plug in the bathroom. It works well, comes with extra heads, is easy to keep clean and I really like the holder that assures the toothbrush remains upright.",

                "reviewText": "The Bitvae Electric Toothbrush has become an indispensable part of my daily oral care routine, and it's easy to see why. This toothbrush, with its sleek design and advanced features, offers a superior cleaning experience that has significantly enhanced the health of my gums and the whiteness of my teeth. The variety of brushing modes, including White, Clean, Soft, Polish, and Gum Care, make it a versatile tool for addressing different dental needs. The White mode, in particular, has noticeably brightened my smile, while the Soft mode provides a gentle touch for those with sensitive gums. The intuitive design of the Bitvae Electric Toothbrush, coupled with its powerful performance, makes it an excellent investment for anyone committed to maintaining optimal oral hygiene.However, it's worth noting that the Bitvae Electric Toothbrush, while fantastic in terms of performance, is a bit on the bulkier side, which can be a minor inconvenience for frequent travelers. The size and shape of the toothbrush may not fit as easily into toiletry bags or travel cases as more compact models. Despite this drawback, the Bitvae Electric Toothbrush's overall effectiveness and range of features make it a compelling choice for everyday use, and its impact on oral health outweighs the minor inconvenience when it comes to portability.",

                "reviewText": "After owning this for 11 months, the toothbrush stopped recharging. The seller had advertised a 2-year warranty, so I contacted them to ask about it. They responded to my messages promptly (within 48 hours), politely, and sent me a replacement in just a few days.As far as the product itself goes, the only real downside is that the stand has poor assembly instructions, feels flimsy, and was counter-intuitive to put together. But it's held up fine. The individual brushes wear out as fast as toothbrushes should, so I've been happy it came with lots of replacements.Between the great price and the hassle-free warranty, using this brush is less expensive than using regular plastic brushes even without the coupon.",

When the timer times out, the toothbrush turns off -- no opinion on that, it's just different from my last toothbrush.",
