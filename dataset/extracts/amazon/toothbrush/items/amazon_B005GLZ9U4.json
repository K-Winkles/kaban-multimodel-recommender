The Pulsar brushes are a bit overpriced and not at ALL durable - mine generally burn out after about 2 months. (I think it's the electronics that are failing, not the battery.) Nevertheless, they are much more effective than normal toothbrushes; my teeth have never felt so clean! I especially like these brushes because they are comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver in your mouth, unlike bulky and awkwardly-shaped rechargeable toothbrushes. They aren't the most cost-effective choice, but they are by far the most comfortable for me, and they do a great job cleaning my teeth.",
