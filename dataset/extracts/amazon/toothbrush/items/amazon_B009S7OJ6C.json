I have tried various brands of all types of materials and each and every one of them just .... gave me goosebumps so to speak (warned you about my texture issue). These are not large or small, and absolutely perfectly smooth! From handle to the head of the brush itself, super smooth. The head of the brush isn't too large causing one to gag or even feel like it is too big for your mouth or anything. I was skeptical of the odd arch/shape of this brush, it is strange. However, it is so oddly perfect once you hold it in your hand. I never would have thought to buy such a brush, but once you use it, you will understand!",

I can\u2019t speak to that part but I can speak to how annoying it is when I set the toothbrush down on a counter. It almost always rolls to one side and the bristles touch tue countertop.

                "reviewText": "I'm 80 years old, have most of my teeth, and have used a LOT of tooth brushes. I estimate that I have brushed my teeth with a toothbrush about 55,000 times. This brush is the best I have ever had. The brushes last and the genuine ergonomic design of the handle and angle of the brushes make the toothbrush very easy to use correctly -brushing the inside and outside tooth surfaces vertically instead of across. Since they last so long ( see the next paragraph about this), and proper dental care prolongs life, I bought 30 of them - enough to last the rest of my life. I discovered these brushes in our grocery store and bought them from Amazon because of the limited quantity. Now the store no longer carries them, which proves the rule that all good products will eventually be taken off the market or made worse by the manufacturer. So, buy a bunch of these because the price is right, they are fabulous brushes, and it appears that are getting harder to find. Later added: The first brush is still going strong. The bristles keep their shape and stiffness (soft), and the ergonomic design continues to be extremely helpful.About the generic three month replacement recommendation for all toothbrushes. Thanks for all of the responses to my question. I have since researched it. The CDC cites only one study about this issue. The study found that there was no evidence of bacterial buildup in toothbrushes after three-four months of use, especially if they are washed in hot water after each use and stored upright in the open air. The only reason to replace a toothbrush under those conditions is if the bristles are damaged, or if you are sick. You can see the study on the CDC website.",
