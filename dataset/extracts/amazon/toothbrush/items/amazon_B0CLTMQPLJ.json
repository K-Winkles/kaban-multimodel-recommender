                "reviewText": "I'm always looking for soft toothbrushes since I have sensitive gums. I really enjoy the softness and how well they clean my teeth. The bristles are a bit flimsy, so they seem to be fraying quicker (see last photo of new vs used, blue brush). I like that it's smaller and easy to maneuver, but they can be tricky to get all the way in the back of your molars. I of course, love the colors and it makes it easy for everyone to know which toothbrush is theirs. These might not be the most affordable set for some, but for our needs it feels worth it. I will definitely be getting more in the future! Only wish these came with covers for easier travel.",

She loves the colors and couldn\u2019t decide between all of them (though she did complain about the yellow one\u2019s appearance making her feel like her brush looked discolored). I thought the color combinations were great. The bristles are super soft. The heads of the brushes are definitely smaller than standard size toothbrushes so they\u2019re pretty ideal for younger kids. They have long handles for easy grip. My daughter loves these.",
