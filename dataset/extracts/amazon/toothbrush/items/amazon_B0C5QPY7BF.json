I took a chance and purchased this set of toothbrushes with the understanding that the product is fairly new and has only been available for purchase through the Amazon site for a few months. (No reviews were available at time of purchase). So glad I did. I have tested multiple bamboo toothbrushes over the last few years. Some I have loved but unfortunately can no longer find for purchase. And I'll admit some were just not ideal (*total trash, not even okay for one time use). But, these guys are amazing!!! No bristle loss, perfect size for effective cleaning, and the \"Goldie Locks\" of firmness- not too hard and not too soft. If you love a good bamboo toothbrush...this set is your friend!",
