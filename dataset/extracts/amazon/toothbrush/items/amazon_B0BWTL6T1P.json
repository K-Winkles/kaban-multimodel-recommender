They clean well, get into the nooks and crannies of the mouth and my gums have never looked more pink or healthier! 4 for $6 is a steal too.

I mean sure they sponge your teeth\u2026.not sure if the extra dense not flexible toothbrush even cleans your teeth, but it definitely does not clean around the gum line very well. In fact, the gum line area of my teeth was practically untouched. The design is horrible I could go on, nothing they say about this product is true except it\u2019s ultra dense bristles which actually make it harder to clean your teeth. I want my money back",
