Surprisingly the bristles on the toothbrush is soft but coarse enough to remove residue from your teeth. Additionally the toothbrushes are lightweight but also durable and easy to keep a firm grip while brushing. They\u2019re so convenient to have available on hand and very good quality for being disposable. I will definitely buy more as they are great for anyovernightguests.",
