                "reviewText": "I purchased this item cause it looks like the dentist one at a great price. It was a bit of an adjustment to glide instead of brush. Regardless, my teeth would still feel furry after brushing. I\u2019d often have to go back over them. At that point, I couldn\u2019t help but brush. There are too many seams in the head that gets filled with toothpaste. That grossed me out. When the battery died before two months and before the bristles went white, that was the last straw for me. I\u2019m back to Colgate 360 and my teeth feel as clean as ever.",
