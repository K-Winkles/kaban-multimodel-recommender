                "reviewText": "Edited on 21 Aug: I explained to the company that the white brush stopped working and they sent a new toothbrush. I changed review to a 4-star toothbrush. Has all the modes, lasts longer than a week, can't beat the price. If these go out or if we run out of heads, then I believe I would order from them again. Thanks20 July: We purchased these on 01 July. My wife got this white one and I purchased the black one. It has a strong motor, 5 different modes, and has lots of replaceable heads. However, my wife's toothbrush just stopped working. It charges but doesn't turn on any longer. My black one works without issue, but this white and pink brush only lasted 18 days before malfunctioning. I wish to be contacted by the seller to rectify the issue. Overall have to rate a 1 star although it is easy to use, lightweight, and affordable.",

Would be about the right size to be a kids toothbrush.Once fully charged, battery seems to last for days.USB charging is a good idea, but the cord is short (12\"-14\" long) and toothbrush has a propietary barrel power connection so don't misplace the USB cable that came with it.Vibration patterns... My girlfriend has an \"intimate\" toy with the same vibration patterns. I would not be surprised of the two devices had the same motor and electronics. No idea if the different patterns have any effect on teeth cleaning.Would I buy again? No. Needs a bigger brush. I'd probably go up to a rotating brush plus ultrasonic.",
