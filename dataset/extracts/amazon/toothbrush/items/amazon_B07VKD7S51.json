I figure if I raise him to live in a conscientious manner from the start, then it will be easier for him to adapt as our world changes.He LOVES these toothbrushes.The only problem is that he\u2019s obsessed with the rainbow one. Swapping to a single color is going to be fun lol.These fit great in his hand. They have very soft bristles, hold the toothpaste well and seem to have his excitement to brush reinvigorated.Handles are bamboo and the bristles are recyclable. These are cheaper than the plastic ones at the grocery store so I will continue to buy these in the future",

                "reviewText": "I like that these Organic, Eco-Friendly, Biodegradable Humble Company Natural Bamboo Toothbrushes come in a set of five different color bristle heads so that they can be kept in the same drawer and we can all tell which one is ours easily and quickly. Love that the handles are compostable and the bristles are recyclable, as we all go through so many toothbrushes over time. The heads of these toothbrushes are small and are easy to fit all sides of the teeth to brush well. They are soft enough to not damage our teeth and gums, but hard enough to clean very well. They're actually very beautiful. They also make a great guest toothbrush. I love that they are each individually wrapped. I did not realize that until I received them. Nice product; fair price. We're very happy with these toothbrushes!",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new brush and am seeking one that is eco-friendly, sustainable, uses recyclables to create products, has combustible packing, animal cruelty free, labor practice friendly, has complete transparency w/their customers, that works, affordable, doesn\u2019t sell in countries that mandates testing on animals in any way except for pharma (only b/c every country has that mandate to this date unfortunately) or conduct unfair/bad labor practices, etc.This hits many of those points but \u2014****BECAUSE they source their nylon bristles from DuPont, they are not a 100% animal cruelty free company.For the product review.Packaging is nice. Quality of the handle is really good sturdy bamboo, I have not researched enough within this company to ensure it is being harvested in the best way or where they source their bamboo from etc.Bristles definitely need some work, their really hard nylon. I ordered a medium.Has a small bristle coverage area comparing, so expect it to take longer to brush, also may have to add a 2nd round of toothpaste, don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the bristle size or the nylon or what that dissipates the paste fast but I have to now do a double paste application.No go if you are like me and animal cruelty free is a top priority along with other earth/universe/people saver points.Update:Got used to the bristles. Don\u2019t have to apply a 2nd round of paste I just don\u2019t add water before brushing now after paste is applied to brush. Bristles are ok now I know not to push at all. In the end to not waste $, as they are compostable, I will be using a different company because they do source from DuPont and also do not hit on a few other points I seek to have covered in the area of saving the world so to speak.",

Anyone preferring a medium hard brush may find these a little too soft but they are a great spare and ideal for travelling. We always dry them with the brush head upright and never let them sit with wet around them and so far there have been no issues with the handle or bristle area discolouring. Very pleased with these, my first experience of bamboo toothbrushes.",
