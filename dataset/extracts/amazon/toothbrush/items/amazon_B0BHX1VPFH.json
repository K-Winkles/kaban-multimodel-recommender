Still, they hold up very well for at least a month ( I haven't travelled longer). I will never buy a single plastic toothbrush again. These are MUCH better!",

I did not take into account my \"weirdness\" about certain textures... and this one may end up being a deal breaker. It's not rough or anything... it's just wet wood. It feels odd in my hand and bothers me when I'm brushing. Nothing at all wrong with the toothbrush itself. It's a very well made product. The bristles are just right, too. I'm going to stick with it and try to get over the texture thing since it's literally just ME and not the product. That's the only reason I took a star away. Otherwise it'd be 5 stars.",
