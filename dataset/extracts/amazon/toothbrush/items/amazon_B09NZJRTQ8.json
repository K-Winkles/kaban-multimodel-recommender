I like that they will not contribute to long term landfill waste.Updated review:I've been using these for a few months and really like them. They last a very long time. They do get a little softer as they wear in.I suppose it's up to the individual person and how frequently and vigorously they brush. I would say I am an average person brushing morning and night, maybe after meals if I'm home. I use a natural (non whitening) toothpaste which might be gentler to the brush, so mine has lasted about 4 months.I will replace it soon as it's beginning to show some wear and tear. It will be cycled to the cleaning brush bin and when that wears out I'll toss it, knowing it won't be just random plastic in the landfill.Excellent value.",
