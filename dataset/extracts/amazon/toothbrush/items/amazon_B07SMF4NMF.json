                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This is a great travel toothbrush. You should buy it.",
                "reviewText": "Pros:- It works very nearly as well as my larger, more powerful Braun electric toothbrush, and that's saying something.- I've found the battery life to be excellent. I have about 50 brushing sessions (and counting) on the original AAA battery, and it's still going strong.- It's extremely packable (but see the con below about the power switch). The cover is exactly the right size and fit, and it packs into my small toiletry bag very well.Cons:- It's easy to press the power button by accident because it sticks out from the side of the handle. While it's never (to my knowledge) accidentally started up while in my luggage, electronics designed for travel should have recessed power buttons.- The toothbrush head itself is a little big. I have a full-sized adult male mouth, and I find it a little awkward getting this toothbrush into places like behind my lower and upper front teeth. It does get in there, but it's awkward.Why I've come to really like this toothbrush:I normally use an electric toothbrush (from Braun), but it's really bigger than I'd like to take traveling. Plus, it's charger requires an AC outlet, and I just don't want to travel with all that. So I've typically traveled with just a regular, manual toothbrush. BUT using an electric toothbrush for many years has really spoiled me. I know exactly how to brush my teeth, but a manual toothbrush just doesn't do as good a job as an electric toothbrush.Reading other reviews of this Voom Sonic toothbrush, I really wasn't sure it would do the trick, so I tried it out for a couple of weeks before my 2-week vacation. My main concerns were efficacy and battery life. Well, it worked great. My teeth didn't feel skuzzy waking up in the morning. I'd planned to put in a new battery immediately before leaving, but I'd noticed no reduction in efficacy during my 2-week trial period, so I figured I'd chance it. (Plus, I knew I could buy AAA batteries in Scotland.) I also expected a bargain-basement battery to be shipped with the toothbrush. But the battery they shipped got through the 2-week pre-trip trial, the 2-week vacation, and has continued over the week since we've been back. That's 5 weeks of consistent use with no reduction in power that I can feel. I've brushed every night before bed, and I'd estimate I've brushed a little over half the mornings. That's about 50 brushing sessions on one battery. I'm very pleased with this and fairly amazed. (And I *still* haven't felt the need to replace the original battery.)So I'd certainly recommend this as a travel toothbrush. It packs well and absolutely does the job of getting my teeth clean. If I had to find something negative about the Voom Sonic toothbrush, I'd prefer a button that isn't so easy to press by mistake. I'm not aware the toothbrush has ever come on in my luggage, but electronics designed for travel should have recessed power buttons. BUT, since this hasn't been an actual, real-world problem for me personally, I'm not going to subtract a star for that.",

It was never wet and the inside was dry b/c I've never opened until today to change the battery which did nothing. Only change I did was the brush head. It is affordable, portable and good but basically once the initial battery is out at 6 months (another reviewer had the same issue) you need to buy a new one. Considering that the price isn't cheap. I also bought brush head replacements so overall it didn't perform or last as quip did which has issue with the water gets into inside and perform poorly. There is no warrantee info for this item so this is quite frustrating. It seems this tooth brush is made for one time - 6month use. Disappointing.",

A battery change did not solve the problem. Also, the battery cover piece won't stay on. Amazon provides a link to Voom Sonic's website for customer support, but the website has no way to contact them -- no email, phone or chat. They only provide a space to sign up for emails. I also bought replacement brushes but obviously can no longer use them, so I wasted money on them, too. I finally found a way to reach Amazon customer service (not easy to find this), and they have no way to connect me with the manufacturer to figure out what is going on with my product, which is obviously not true because they have a vendor/seller relationship. This product is a waste of money. Very disappointed in the product AND Amazon.",
