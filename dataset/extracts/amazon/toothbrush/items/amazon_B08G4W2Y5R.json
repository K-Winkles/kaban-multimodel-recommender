Great Value for 4 of these toothbrushes.",

The only thing is you have to really open the bristles up and thoroughly rinse in between every time you use, because the bristles are very tight and stuck together. Also because the brush is so firm be careful at first and watch your gums because you can easily scratch.",

Plus they last a very long time. The bristles doesn't wear out over time like most toothbrushes. I would say if you have sensitive teeth and gums this might be harsh for you.",
