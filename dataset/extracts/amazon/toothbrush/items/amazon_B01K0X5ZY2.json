                "reviewText": "I don't usually get hepped up about toothbrushes, but I do change the regular ones every three months. My dental hygienist recommended getting a round rotating toothbrush and she said even the cheaper ones are good for reaching back teeth, etc. I purchased these Arm & Hammer toothbrushes and they work even better than the branded ones that sell for much more. I love them! They are easy to use, easy to clean and the battery has along life, since I haven't had to change it out yet after a few months. The brush changes color when it's no longer doing its job. The package contains extra brush heads. Just love them and trust Arm and Hammer products completely. A great buy at a great price! I highly recommend this toothbrush.",
