My electric tooth brush now dries completely and it is covered thanks to these wonderful \u201cStreripods\u201d. The brush would never dry completely with the cover that came with the brush. Dampness is a breeding ground for all sorts of grossness. I\u2019m am not sure if it is sanitizing my toothbrush or not but I am sure that it is doing a better job than the covers that came with the brush. There is a slight chemical odor when you take you toothbrush out of the pod. HOWEVER if you follow the instructions and rinse before using is goes away and you can brush as usual. I think that the odor is there to assure you that it is sanitizing. I added to my subscribe and save to fulfill every 3 months. Very happy with this find!",

When I travel, I prefer to put my toothbrush in a case so I don't recommend this product for those instances. These pods keep our toothbrushes fresh in our small bathroom. I have been using this product since I was in college using communal bathrooms and shower caddys, and this product has never failed me! I like how you can sign up for text alerts to remind you when to change the pod, because I always forget! Whenever I see these go on sale I always stock up because they are more expensive than a typical toothbrush cover, but I think they also last longer.",

It helps to read the description before you make a purchase.When you open the package, you will notice they are individually wrapped. Clean and ready to go! You may notice a strong smell. You purchased an item meant to help keep your toothbrush clean which means there will be a substance in the case which does just that. They recommend these be replaced in about three months, assuming the stuff inside that keeps your brush clean will wear off. Before you clean your teeth, you can run your brush under the tap for a few seconds. It should help with the smell/taste.I bought this item mostly because my toothbrush is wider and the cases I usually buy do not close properly. These fit perfectly. Happy with them so far!",
