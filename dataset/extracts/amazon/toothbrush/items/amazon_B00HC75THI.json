                "reviewText": "I prefer tooth brushes that are a little stiffer then the usual variety, these are nice in that regard.The handles are easy to keep a grip of even when wet which makes it easy to twist the brush when trying to get at the molars and wisdom teeth. I like the cleaning action, they simply do a good job of removing crud without hurting my gums. I suspect that this is because of the unique brush design. The polishing cups are an interesting add-on and probably provide better cleaning on the actual tooth surface we can see but the bristles do a good job of getting between teeth thereby reducing the amount of flossing that's needed.Price wise this is a decent deal. I've been using the same brush now for weeks and it still works and performs great. I expect that the four pack will easily last me a year.",
