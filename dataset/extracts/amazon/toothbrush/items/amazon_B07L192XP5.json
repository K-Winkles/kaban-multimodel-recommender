Can't speak much for whitening capabilities as I have only begun using them with charcoal activated paste. They come 5 per package so should hold up for quite a while depending on one's brushing style. The only con I have is the ultra softness of the bristles. I prefer very stiff bristles but I'm getting used to them. A much different feeling that is actually making me brush longer which is a good thing. Great colors and I like the black bristles. The bristles are black in color only and not charcoal activated in any way. I've used these with both my Caliwhite charcoal paste and regular Colgate gel. Works well with anything. So far I am pleased and would recommend and order again. WWGOWGA",

I tried to lighten up but my teeth didn't feel clean. I took a chance on these and I love them. It kida forces me to brush lighter because they are soft bristles and here are a lot more in the brush. My teeth just feel cleaner than the old brushes. Ill never go back to those plastic bristles again. Can you imagine what that plastic crap is doing to your enamel. My wife has sensitive teeth and she loves this brush too. Anyway the whole CHARCOAL thing they mention in the description irrelevant, if that's turning you off about these brushes its simply means nothing. Simply your teeth, gums, and mouth just feels cleaner after brushing with this brush.. God bless, God speed, and good luck!",
