                "reviewText": "These toothbrushes are perfectly satisfactory for short term use on trips. They come individually wrapped, so you just have to grab a few from the box to pack, and then throw them away before returning home. No need to find a way to pack a wet toothbrush. They are inexpensive enough that I also use them for cleaning and dusting hard-to-reach areas like the crevices around decorative carving, etc. I will absolutely buy these again when I run out.",
