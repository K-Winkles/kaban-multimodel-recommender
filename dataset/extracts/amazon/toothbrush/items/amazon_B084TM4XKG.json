                "reviewText": "Fantastic electric toothbrush! Great cleaning action at a great price. I feel like I've been to the dentist office for a cleaning every time I use this brush. I really like timer function that prompts me to move from quadrant to quadrant and brush for two minutes. Brush pauses and emits a beep every 30 seconds and shuts off automatically after two minutes in the CLEAN setting. Two and a half minutes for the WHITENING setting and three minutes for the GUMS setting. Haven't tried the latter two settings but I assume they have the same feel, just longer durations.Brush comes with a charging stand, but I've only charged it once initially and have been using it twice a day for a week without having to recharge. Mine also came with two extra brush heads.The sonic action is a little disconcerting at first and it sort of tickles if a touch the roof of my mouth with the brush. Can be a little messy if you don't keep your mouth closed around the brush as much as possible. And you will drool a little when brushing for two minutes.Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Once I decided on Sonicare, spent a while comparing models to get the most bang for my buck. I went with the 5300 with 3 heads, in part due to the days between charging. At home, it sits on the charger anyway, but if I travel, don\u2019t want to bring the base. And really- if the battery stops working when I\u2019m out of town- not the end of the world, can still use it to manually brush.The head was small anticipated, but I\u2019m liking it. The travel case is huge and unnecessary. I already have a couple toiletry kits and the brush fits in those. Try as I might, I never get to 2 minutes, but I am brushing longer than I was previously. The only weakness, in my opinion is that it stutters or pauses if I press too hard. Okay, so I try not to do that, but never had that issue with disposable electric brushes.I encourage you to also compare all their models before making a purchase. One more thing, it came with an unexpected coupon- if I registered, they\u2019d send me a free head. The form was incompatible with this model number.",

The vibration lowers when it detects your gums. The three different modes are great when pairing with specific toothpastes. What else? Hmm, idk! My teeth and gums feel so much healthier after using it for a while now. Definitely recommend!",
