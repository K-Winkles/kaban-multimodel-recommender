The heads are made with soft nylon and are infused with activated-charcoal for maximum whitening and reduction in bacteria growth. The long-lasting battery provides 4 weeks of brushing between charges. Ela Mint Toothpaste Ela Mint was created to address the \u201csilent epidemic\u201d in healthcare. Instead of fluoride (first used +100 years ago), our toothpaste features nano-hydroxyapatite (n-Ha), a modern evolution in dentistry that\u2019s become a gold standard in Japan for over 40-years. Ela Mint features nano-hydroxyapatite, a modern evolution in medicine and dentistry (the mineral makes up the primary foundation of teeth and bones\u2014that\u2019s why it\u2019s so restorative). Plus, it\u2019s 100% non-toxic and fluoride-free. Rasana Tongue Cleaner The Rasana stainless-steel tongue cleaner is both easy to use and effective. While tongue cleaning has been a tradition in Eastern and Ayurvedic medicine to both reduce bacteria causing bad breath, illness, and improve taste, most people are improperly cleaning their tongue today. Hold cleaner with two hands by each handle and position at the back of the tongue and gently pull. You\u2019ll soon discover why this is the most important oral care routine that you haven\u2019t been doing. Ela Mint Floss Your mouth thanks you for your flossing habit. Your dental bills do as well. Keep your good habit going strong with our natural floss. Made with vegetable wax, it\u2019s Teflon-free, petroleum-free and provides a thorough, satisfying clean.",
