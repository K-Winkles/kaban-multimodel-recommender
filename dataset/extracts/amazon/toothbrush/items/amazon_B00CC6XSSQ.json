                "reviewText": "I was so surprised by the firmness and flatness of this toothbrush; it describes them as soft, but this is one of the firmest brushes I've ever used. They are very basic and don't have all the rubber, notches, and ridges that most fancier brushes have, and I wouldn't recommend this as your single brush to use all the time, but let me tell you how I have enjoyed it and why I've even bought another package of these!I have been using small/soft toothbrushes as recommended by my dentist my entire life and I've been fairly happy with the one I've been using for the last few years, but I wanted a pack of cheaper brushes to keep for occasional guests or to have on hand for travel, etc. When I got them, I wanted to try one first and they are SO FIRM and featureless, BUT when I thought to just use it once in a while, like once a day or every-other day, it was game-changing! They really give me a very clean and freshly-scrubbed feeling that I love and I haven't had any gum issues from them being firmer. They don't get in all the crannies or have the other features my regular brush has and they are too firm and aggressive for me to use multiple times a day, but they've been great. I've used them like this for months and I will continue to do so.",

They also are abrasive enough to scrub my teeth clean and the feel of food on my teeth is gone after I brush.Also a bonus that they\u2019re cheap, so you can easily replace your toothbrush every few months or after being sick and it won\u2019t break the bank like so many other toothbrush brands",
