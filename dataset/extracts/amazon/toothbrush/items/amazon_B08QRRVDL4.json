The head fits snugly on the brush handle and doesn\u2019t move at all while cleaning but it\u2019s still very easy to remove and change the head when you\u2019re ready. It takes a few times to get used to the weight and feel of the toothbrush but that doesn\u2019t take long. Would love to see this in a wider range of colours for larger households (only comes in silver and navy blue). Would highly recommend.",

Si buscas eso es 100% recomendable.Cabe se\u00f1alar que las cerdas son firmes y si est\u00e1s acostumbrado a cerdas suaves, puede ser inc\u00f3modo, desconozco si hay reemplazos con otra configuraci\u00f3n de cerdas.",
