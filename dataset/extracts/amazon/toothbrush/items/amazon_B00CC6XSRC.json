                "reviewText": "I bought these for cleaning my 1994 Camaro Z28\u2019s engine bay, and I am incredibly impressed not only with how well they cleaned but also how well they held up!My car\u2019s bay had not been cleaned since it came off the line nearly 30 years ago, and I wasn't sure if there was any hope for it to ever be clean again. After much debating, I decided to order a couple of packs of these toothbrushes as a last-ditch effort because wire brushes were too hard to get into tight spaces, and microfiber cloths were not very effective.These toothbrushes, used in conjunction with some O'Reilly's brake cleaner, have made this engine look so good! While it may not look show-worthy without removing the engine from the bay for a more thorough cleaning, these toothbrushes helped me achieve a very clean look! The best part is that it only took 2 brushes out of the 2 packs to get my desired effect! I am amazed at the toothbrushes' durability, especially when using harsh chemicals on them!",
