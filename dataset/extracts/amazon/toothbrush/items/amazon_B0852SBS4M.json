I didn't experience this with other cheaper electric toothbrushes. I even have it on the lowest intensity. To help my gums recover I bought this manual toothbrush which is great!

But this toothbrush basically saved my life and I just received it less than a half hour ago. I brushed my teeth immediately after receiving this. Because I haven\u2019t been able to brush due to no toothbrush is being sensitive enough for my gums. I have receding gums. Every single time I would brush my teeth, it would be excruciating pain because of the stupid bristles they put on all of the toothbrushes. This one is different. I didn\u2019t even know they made toothbrushes like this. I was able to brush very very thoroughly for the first time in months. It was so refreshing and nice to actually be able to clean my mouth well without just using mouthwash. And actually being able to clean my teeth well. Thank you so much for making such a product. You have a customer for life.",

                "reviewText": "I do love the fact it's almost impossible to brush hard enough to hurt yourself with this brush. It feels like petting the silkiest puppy, it's really weird, but nice.That's about where the positives end for me though. The brush head feels gigantic and it's so soft that I don't really feel like it's doing a good job cleaning, especially in the tighter corners. The brush head has no taper to get into smaller spaces so it can't reach into these space to get things clean.I think this is a good brush for early morning cleanings or freshening up cleanings, but for actual removal of debris it doesn't feel like it does enough. Even brushing at every angle and every nook and cranny this brush can get to my mouth felt very not clean for the amount of time invested the two times I used it for my in depth end of night routine.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Extra Soft Toothbrush for Sensitive Gums and Teeth and while I am generally satisfied with the performance of this product, there are a few areas that could be improved upon. The bristles are quite soft, which is great for sensitive gums, but they do not provide as thorough a clean as a regular toothbrush. I have noticed a slight improvement in the sensitivity of my gums, but not as much as I was expecting.In terms of the toothbrush's design, the handle is a bit thin and slippery, making it difficult to hold onto at times. The head is also larger than a regular toothbrush, which can make it difficult to reach all areas of the mouth. However, the toothbrush does have rounded bristles as advertised, which are gentle on the gums.Overall, the Extra Soft Toothbrush for Sensitive Gums and Teeth is a good choice for people with sensitive gums who are looking for a gentle cleaning option. It is not as effective at cleaning as a regular toothbrush, but it does have some nice features such as rounded bristles and a soft bristle design. I would recommend this toothbrush with the caveat that it may not provide as thorough a clean as a regular toothbrush.",
