I decided to replace it and to buy this instead to try it out. It was definitely a great find! Not only was it a great value, but the product is solid. This toothbrush cleans your teeth and stimulates your gums to at the same time. You can choose the level of intensity, which helps when you have sensitive teeth. In addition, it has a timer to help remind you to keep brushing and the battery keeps its charge forever it seems- a couple months or more. I also love that it has so many extra toothbrush heads. The name brand products give you one or two and the refills are expensive.I like this toothbrush so much I bought two more for my older kids. It is a must-have item if you value your dental health!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a gift for my college nephews. They wanted to try an electric toothbrush for the first time. I went with this one because it had great reviews and extra brush heads, unlike the other top brand name companies. So far they love it. It holds a very long charge, easy for they to store and travel with and the extra brush heads mens they don't have to spend more money to replace them in a long while.",

So thankful I found these for my and my husband. They have different speeds and leave my teeth feeling amazing. I don\u2019t spend tons of time like I did with a manual brush. The product isn\u2019t heavy. I also loved that it came with replacement heads that will last a while before reordering.",

Same with the rest. She\u2019s on her last 2 head brush now. Description says the included 6 brushes will last 18months. Now I\u2019m looking to buy more replacement brush heads but I couldn\u2019t find anything that fits the brush! It\u2019s different from the standard sonicare brushes, I know because I have 2 more sonicare brushes and none of its brushes fit when I tried to put one on this brush.",
