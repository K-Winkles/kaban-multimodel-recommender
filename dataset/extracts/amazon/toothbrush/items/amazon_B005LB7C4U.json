The bristles are \u201csharp\u201d but in a good way\u2014 they are VERY effective at cleaning your teeth down to the gums and beneath. My teeth always feel slippery and clean after use.The first time you use a Nimbus, go easy on the gums or you\u2019ll have sore gums for a day. Ease in. Your gums will toughen up.When bristles begin to arch outwards, toss and get a new one. Usually one lasts about 3-4 months. No need to brush hard.The Nimbus was the brush my dentist gave out to patients years ago. No longer with the dentist but I will ALWAYS be with this brand toothbrush.Brush by just moving the head in tiny circles with bristles against the gums, angled toward the base of your teeth. That does the best job.Hardly have to floss after! Using this toothbrush. (But I do.)Such a fantastic toothbrush!",
