Brushing with your Spinbrush is simple \u2013 brush the same as you would with any other toothbrush. Are the brush heads replaceable? Replacement heads are available for all Spinbrush and will fit on, and work with Daily Clean, Ultra White, and Truly Radiant toothbrushes. These heads will not fit on, or work with Sonic toothbrushes. Replacement heads specific to Sonic toothbrushes are available, and will not fit on, or work with other Spinbrush toothbrushes. When do I change the brush head? Change the brush head every 3 months or sooner if the brush head is worn or parts are loose. Not doing so can lead to brush head breakage, generation of small parts, and possible injury. Changing the brush head every 3 months ensures the best bristle quality for cleaning.",
