                "reviewText": "I don't write to many review but the Apical Life Ultra Soft Toothbrushes are just outstanding, not just for their value but for what they are and do. First off, This tooth brush is a hidden gem. Having searched for a long time and having tried all the big name brands and some non-name brands claiming to be soft, I finally found these buried in the Amazon pages. I tried these out for 2 weeks before leaving this review and all I can say is that for a set of 5 brushes, these are outstanding and top all competitors by far. If you want a tooth brush that gets the job done without damaging your gums, these are it. 5 brushes for ~$10 is just insane. Kudos to all those who made and distributed these fine brushes.",

                "reviewText": "My kids love these toothbrushes, sensitive gums is a trait that my kids got from me. So little did I know, it was the reason they hated brushing their teeth. So when they woke up with these babies under there pillows from the tooth fairy \ud83e\uddda\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f aka mom ( when a child looses a tooth in my house, all the kids get new toothbrushes, floss, mouthwash etc. instead of money. They also know mom is the tooth fairy) my kids each came to me one by one to tell me how soft their new toothbrush is and how comfortable it feels in comparison to the \"soft\" bristle brushes. They love brushing their teeth now, and have turned it into an event, they remind each other its time to brush and the 4 of them all venture into the bathroom together to brush and make sure the younger siblings brush correctly. It's music to my ears to hear them enjoy an activity they once dreaded.",
