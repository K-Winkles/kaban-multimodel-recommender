The high speed brush was also uncomfortable how it felt when in use. I returned the product. I like this Oral B toothbrush much better! It vibrates slower, but is pleasant to use. It doesn't have a timer, which I don't need anyway. Simple is better! The speed on this Oral B brush is perfect in my humble opinion. The speed is still high enough to get the job done. It works great and is simple to use. I recommend this toothbrush and think it is a really nice product.",

                "reviewText": "Updated review:In my original review I gave it 1 star and mentioned how it started to inexplicably malfunction after only a month of use.After additional troubleshooting, turns out, it was the battery. I had put brand new Duracell batteries in this thing when I got it, but it uses more power than other models I've used in the past. Thus, you have to change it out more often. I would say Duracell batteries run down in this device after a month of twice-daily use. Might be even shorter for cheaper brand batteries.When the battery is low it will turn on and off while you're brushing. It will also do that twitching thing randomly that it is only supposed to do when the 2 minute timer runs out. It only happens when the battery is low. I've tested this several times now and as soon as I put in a new battery, it works perfectly again.So, it isn't a malfunction like I originally thought, but there was no way I would've known that if I didn't troubleshoot. Changing my star rating to 5 stars since it does the job and makes it easier to know if I'm brushing for the dentist recommended 2 minutes.Original review:After a month, the toothbrush no longer spins. I noticed a few times that once the timer activates (where it'll vibrate for a few seconds) it would malfunction and stop spinning for a few seconds. But now, even after replacing the heads and troubleshooting, it continues to malfunction.",

Very little plaque or staining, and the toothbrush is not as noisy as my previous electric toothbrush. It still makes a noise, but it's not as obnoxious. And I like the rotary action better than the vibrating style.",
