The handles are longer making the grip much better, the compact and soft but super cleansing bristles will NOT break your skin and leave your teeth really clean! No bleeding gums at all! I've used expensive brushes and they hurt and were like spikes on my gums no matter how soft making me bleed extensively. Whatever you do, please don't stop making them. You should market these to the Ehlers-Danlos Society and let others with my genetic disorder get help as well. I will stand behind this product 100% and I would let you use my name and testimony if you ever needed. I have well documented dr info regarding the Ehlers-Danlos and other issues. So I'm legit! I can't say enough good things about your toothbrushes!!! I will NEVER need another and have thrown away every other I have. You're a Godsend!

                "reviewText": "I like this toothbrush as it is super soft. I feel that it cleans my gums very well and able to get to little gaps between the teeth. I also like that it has a broad surface with compact bristles, being able to brush a bigger area.One minor drawback with this toothbrush is with the plastic stick. It is thick but fragile at the same time, one of the tooth brush broke in the middle whilst brushing\u2026which I never encountered before with any brand.Overall, if the stick is sturdier and solid, I would recommend this tooth brush as I really like the design and quality of the bristles.",

                "reviewText": "This toothbrush is very durable yet gentle on both the teeth and gums. The softness of the brushes is perfect. I have had some bleeding of the gums with other soft toothbrushes, but never had bleeding with the Oralphi toothbrush. The densness of the brushes also make this toothbrush last forever.Most toothbrushes only last for several months. The Oralphi has lasted me over 6 months and still going. It's truly an amazing toothbrush!I have finally found the brand of toothbrush that is the only one that I will use for the rest of my life and my wife agrees that she will never have to look for another toothbrush again.My oral hygienist always comments on how clean my teeth are and makes her job very easy. I told her about this toothbrush and she will most likely recommend it to her other patients as well. A+++",

                "reviewText": "I like the brush; it is thick wide and very soft and easy on gums. However, during brushing the bristles are shedding every time I brush. Now to be clear the bristles are shedding by 1-3 at a time , but this is not good because they can get stuck between teeth. So, I will keep these and use them up, but I will not buy again.",
