                "reviewText": "They clean our teeth exceptionally well and quickly; can use rechargeable, alkaline or standard AA batteries; and best of all have similar cost to old less effective manual toothbrushes in the long term. We're using Costco's Eneloop batteries that take only a couple of hours to charge, but alkalines you can buy most anywhere last a long time too (haven't tried regular non-alkalines but they're probably fine too). My spouse was bothered by the Spinbrush's noise level with alkalines, but I found that the lower voltage of fully charged Eneloop batteries (1.2v vs. 1.5v) makes it run more slowly and quietly while still doing a great job of cleaning our teeth. It goes a couple of weeks on one charge. I find it helps to wet the brush before applying paste, because water lubricates the mechanism so it runs faster and uses less battery overcoming the initial friction before liquid gets into the brush on its own.We'd been using the vastly more expensive Braun Oral B Professional Care 2000 but when the battery life started to shorten after a couple of years of interminable 18 hour recharging cycle, we finally tried the Spinbrush Pro my sister had given us. It does a better job than the Oral B, on top of all the other advantages, plus being smaller and lighter for travel. We found some unsettling Spinbrush info online, including a recall from people actually being injured by early versions of these, but they've made some changes and now they're fine with reasonable care (e.g. don't use as a hammer, so maybe not robust enough for some kids).Unlike some reviewers, we've found the batteries easy to install/replace. It's literally a snap. I've attached a pic showing that you put thumbs together where the cap meets the Spinbrush, and your fingers further away from that point on the other side. Pushing firmly up with your thumbs while pushing down with your fingers, you hear a little snap and it's partly open as in the pic. Then you can wiggle the cap out the rest of the way or push with just one thumb on the opposite side to make it even easier (that moves the catch on the outside of the hidden battery cap away from the Spinbrush body for easier opening). My spouse likes to just continue the move used to get the snap while pulling out and wobbling the cap, but sometimes that spills batteries on the floor when it opens. The battery caps seem to come in either dark gray or white, so if you have the gray you might not notice the little diagram you can see more clearly on the pic of my white cap than on my spouse's gray cap. On the cap are the battery polarity indicators too.We like the Spinbrush so much my spouse bought another one and we've retired the Brauns. Highly Recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Arm & Hammer Spinbrush replaced older version which I had for 7 years. Batteries were already in - but no protection to prevent battery from draining. Came with toothbrush head already attached. Brush did not have power of my previous one and Batteries died on 3rd day. I replaced Batteries and it's now a stronger motion to clean teeth. It is extremely noisy and vibrates. Idk if it's their upgrades or if it was a damaged brush. Will find a better brush and save this for emergencies.",
