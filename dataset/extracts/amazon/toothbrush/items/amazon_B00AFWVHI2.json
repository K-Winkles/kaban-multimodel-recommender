                "reviewText": "These are my favorite toothbrushes! After getting braves, I wanted to find every option to keep my teeth as clean as possible. I bought a water flosser and stumbled upon these and switched over to use them instead of my normal toothbrush. I feel like these get everything much cleaner and they help get into all the crevices and everything. A couple months after I started using them, I had a dental cleaning appointment and the hygienist complimented how clean my teeth were! She said I had the \"cleanest braces teeth she has ever seen\". So the cleaning she did was minimal. Needless to say, I think these brushes helped me to do that. I've even converted my husband! As an awesome bonus, these are cruelty free. Sounds like a small thing, but the major dental care brands all still test on animals. I vow to never buy another product that isn't cruelty free. So that gives these bonus points.",

The bristle texture is just perfect and is shaped in a way that the bristles fit into all of the cracks and corners and clean so well. I also love that they\u2019re infused with silver to kill germs between uses. The whole family loves them so this multipack is great!",

                "reviewText": "I have an electric toothbrush that I use, but there are times I want to quickly brush my teeth and be done with it. And being honest, I don't floss as much as I should. I decided to try these toothbrushes and they really do help get between the teeth. I have 2 teeth that food tends to get stuck between (sorry, know that is gross), and regular brushing does not get the food out. I have to floss to remove the food. These toothbrushes DO work at getting stuff stuck between my teeth. And my teeth feel like I used my electric toothbrush after brushing with this toothbrush. I've never used any other toothbrush that made my teeth feel so clean. I had a dentist appointment this week and my hygienist commented that I must be doing a better job of flossing, because my teeth looked great and there wasn't a lot of tartar or plaque build-up. Nope! Didn't floss any more than normal. Just used these toothbrushes. So after getting the good check-up from my hygienist I will continue to buy and use these toothbrushes. Highly recommend.",

They are brilliant and my mouth feels so clean after using them. They are impregnated with silver to combat bacteria. And they are the correct consistency fir the gums. A good size for the job too. Not too big and not to narrow.Will always buy these now.",
