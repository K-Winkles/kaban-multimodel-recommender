                "reviewText": "I purchased this as a Christmas present for my wife and myself in November 2020. Fast forward to today, and it's still going strong after three years of regular use.The durability of this toothbrush is impressive. Only last week we noticed that the battery wasn't lasting as long as it used to, barely making it through a single use before needing a recharge. However, given the overall longevity and performance, I'm willing to explore options for replacing the battery. If that doesn't work out, I wouldn't hesitate to repurchase this model.In those three years, this has never let us down. In fact, it's been a cost-effective choice compared to cheaper brushes or manual ones. The initial price, which seemed like an investment at the time, more than paid off with its consistent performance and longevity.One standout feature is the convenient carrying case, making it easy to travel with. The toothbrush's battery life is exceptional, allowing for extended use even during extended trips. I've been on two-week journeys and never had to charge it more than once, even while brushing three times daily.What we truly love is the systematic approach it provides for teeth cleaning. With a built-in timer and a recommended pattern for cleaning, you're guided through each session, ensuring that every section of your mouth gets the attention it deserves. The first time I used this toothbrush, I was amazed at how fresh and clean my mouth felt. It was like a professional dental cleaning from the comfort of my own home.The Aquasonic Duo has been a reliable, long-lasting, and cost-effective addition to our daily oral care routine. It's designed for convenience, travel, and precision in cleaning, and it has truly revolutionized our approach to dental hygiene. If you're in search of a dependable electric toothbrush, look no further. This is a purchase that keeps on giving and leaves your mouth feeling brand new after every use.",

This electric toothbrush is so superior in every way to our previous ones! It cleans better, holds a charge for over a month (no need to keep it plugged in all the time), the brushes last longer. And the price is right! What else can I say? I'm very pleased with this investment for better oral health.",

You don't need to be aggressive unless you push brush all the way on. You dont need to push all the way in to work. Be careful to avoid break it. Comes with replacement, that's awesome. Comes with a case too. All I can say is get it it works well. I love it. However i do wish there was a separate on and off button. Because you have to go thru every speed (there's 3 ) before it turns off. And make sure you turn it off while its in your mouth. Also theres a timer, idk how that works I didn't read about how it works and it's not noticeable if its automatic. Long battery life. I have yet to change it",

It has two cleaning modes for cleaning it also has a gum health mode. It seems to be soft on the gums and teeth but does a great job cleaning. It also hooks to blue tooth for dental health tracking. It is a sleek look with the black and white with chrome. It comes with two carry cases for traveling, they are very sturdy and easy to put in a carry on, they keep your toothbrushes clean, and snap closed tightly. Great product or the price. The reason for a 4 is all of the modes are fast. If you put your toothpaste on and do not turn your toothbrush on inside your mouth, it will likely fly off your toothbrush.",

I haven\u2019t had a cavity since using it (I still floss every night). Highly recommend!The battery lasts for about 1.5-2 weeks which is enough to take it on vacation with me without the charger.",

If you have a sensitive mouth I wouldn't suggest that setting but it's amazing. They sit on the charging dock so they're always fully charged, nice size to keep beside the sink as well. There's a 2 min timer on them, every 30s it pauses to let you know. At the 2 min mark it auto shuts off.If you finish before the 2 mins you'll have to press the button up to 3 times to turn it off depending on which setting you chose to brush with. If you use the 3rd setting you just need to click once. They also come with great plastic durable cases and a very good number of replaceable heads.I definitely recommend these.",
