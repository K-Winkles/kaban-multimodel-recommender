                "reviewText": "It's an excellent toothbrush for the price I paid. It is matte black in color, weighs only 3.4 oz., and has a very sleek design. Before this toothbrush, I was using the Sonicare Philips Sonicare E-Series tooth brush after I ran out of their replacement heads, which are ridiculously expensive and cost around $10 per head. This new toothbrush comes with eight replacement heads. Furthermore, the brush heads are made of DuPont nylon bristles and are of superior quality, even better than Sonicare. I have used this toothbrush for over 4 months, and I haven't changed the brush head yet. With this new toothbrush, I brush twice a day, which I never did earlier. I am planning to get a third one so that I can keep it in my other bathroom. I purchased one for my wife, who adores it. The battery life is unparalleled in my experience, lasting two months. I took this brush on a 2-week trip to Europe with no charging cable, and it worked very well. I only use this brush at the highest intensity level, and the rest of the modes mean less to me. I am extremely happy with the purchase and strongly recommend you get one.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this toothbrush to replace our old travel set; tested this out for a few weeks & discovered it works better than our 4 previous electric units, of similar design. Plus that it comes with 8 heads is a nice bonus; only thing missing is a storage/carrying case.Pros: Nice design, with multiple modes and intensity settings in one unit. Easy plug in charging port on the bottom, without having to put on a stand to charge. Great for home use and for travel. Power is strong on full, much stronger than our other brands; if you need that extra cleaning boost. Easy to change between modes and power settings. Sleek long handle is easy to hold for larger hands. Waterproof and long lasting battery.Cons: Three things we think that are missing are: charging port should be a regular micro to USB instead of a special plug, could include a storage case and a listing to buy the same and/or any replacement heads. We know this unit is easier to charge than others that had to be put in a stand to charge, but we always have a micro/type C cable on hand. As for the case, we have 2 cases from previous sets; and thankfully it fits in the one hard case. And we know you get 8 heads, but for a family of 4 they will not last long.This is a must have product to keep you teeth clean and healthy; regular brushes just do not work the same. So far this is the best sonic toothbrush we have used; it makes our teeth feel so clean and polished, like we just were at the dentist for a good cleaning. The price is also low for what you receive; quality waterproof electric toothbrush with 5 modes & 3 power levels and 8 head replacements for only $20!",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a decent toothbrush, especially for the price and the eight brush heads. It\u2019s troubling that there are no replacement brush heads offered by the seller, though I\u2019ve read some reviews, and some say one of the Phillips ultrasonic brush heads are compatible. I haven\u2019t had to test this yet. Even if there were no compatible brush heads available , there so many brushes in the package, it seems that i will definitely get $20 worth out of this toothbrush as long as he keeps working. The only thing I don\u2019t like about the toothbrush is that it\u2019s very easy to hit the mode button and the on and off button while you\u2019re brushing your teeth therefore, I did only give 4 stars for ease to holding it. If you put the pressure on the opposite way, you\u2019re less likely to press them function buttons, so that does solve the problem . I don\u2019t understand what the differences in the different functions of this toothbrush, other than a sensitive tooth one which makes it less powerful. The other ones seem just unnecessary, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same with any of the top brand as well . I use the toothbrush on the highest setting, and it works very well. The timer works just like similar to the Phillips, and the brush heads are very similar to the Phillips as well. I\u2019ve only had it about a month so I haven\u2019t been able to test how long the rechargeable battery will last. I have had to charge it once during the month. I did not charge it right out of the box. I let it deplete and then I charged it. It was charged when it came out of the box so I don\u2019t know how much charge it had. Seems the battery life is good. I will update this review if anything changes my opinion about this toothbrush.",
