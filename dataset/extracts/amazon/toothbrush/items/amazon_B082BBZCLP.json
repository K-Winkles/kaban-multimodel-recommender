I\u2019ve used bamboo toothbrushes before, and not had problems. There is a taste to get used to, if you weren\u2019t expecting one like I wasn\u2019t, I\u2019m just letting you know. What I\u2019m having trouble with this time around is the size and the texture of the bristles. I don\u2019t have particularly sensitive gums or teeth, but I don\u2019t feel as though I\u2019m able to clean my teeth as thoroughly as with a larger toothbrush, and the bristles are irritating my gums. This product is an option in a sea of sustainable and quality options, use at your own discretion and comfort preferences :))",
