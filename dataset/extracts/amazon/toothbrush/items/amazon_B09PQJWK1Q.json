He has sensitive gums and this doesn't hurt him. It also has stronger modes if you like a harder brushing. It gives an amazing cleaning. The travel case is really nice and very handy. The charge lasts a long time before needing a recharge. It even has a mount. We put it on the mirror and it holds nicely. Well worth the cost! Looking forward to getting one for myself.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars 6 Brush heads, not 8 - Pretty good value, the sizing is a little weird",
                "reviewText": "There are 6 standard brushing heads, 1 interdental brush and 1 other brush they call a tongue brush. Considering you're supposed to change your toothbrush every 3 months you need 4 per year. So you only get 2 years of brushing if you change your brush head every 4 months with this package instead. 1.5 years at 3 month intervals.The head size is smaller than what I'm used to in a toothbrush. I've used this for about 2 months now and I'm used to it. The neck size under the brush is also wider and that makes it a little harder to maneuver around my mouth. I would look for that be narrower if I ever buy an electric again.One of my problems is that I have always brushed too hard. That and bruxism caused my gums to start to recede and I've worn away my teeth right above the gum line, almost as if someone started to saw my teeth there. That's because many brushes have longer bristles at the edges so when I brushed hard it was grinding my tooth away in a straight line across multiple teeth. It's a bad habit and if I went gently for a week, I'd only go back to brushing very hard again. I've got sensitivity issues from losing my enamel this way as well.I wanted to try an electric because I thought it would help me to stop damaging my teeth. 30+ years of brushing my adult teeth like they were made of diamonds needed to stop. The electric brush definitely has helped in this regard. I hold the bristles at the edge of the tooth I'm brushing and roll the brush vertically so the bristles get into my gums at an angle. I go up and down several times per tooth and then move on to the next one. That's how the instructions say to use it, at an angle. If I press too hard the bristles don't really vibrate and so don't clean as well. That's the opposite of when I use a manual toothbrush where pressing hard scrubbed the surface better. The less pressure on the tooth surface the more the bristle jumps around for a better clean. So I'm developing a better habit of letting the bristles do the work.The 30 second timer is great. It simply pauses the vibration momentarily. After 2 months of twice a day (or more) I'm pretty darn good at timing the sides of my teeth. I do upper outer side, lower outer side, upper underneath and backside and then lower topside and backside last. If I hold the brush vertically I have found it cleans the backs of my teeth better. I use much less toothpaste than I did with a manual and I get better results. If I used the normal amount most of it goes down the drain.The whitening setting is max power and the instructions say don't do it more than twice a week. It's too much. I use the next setting except for twice a week whitening. The other settings are useless in my opinion. I use the general \"Clean\" setting to do everything. After my teeth are done, I turn it back on and do my gums and tongue with the same brush head. The tongue brush they included is nothing special. It's just a regular brush head with a concave shape. I also use a tongue scrape. I haven't tried the interdental brush yet but will eventually.Toothpaste tube for scale. The battery lasts a while. I've charged it 2 times and just did a 3rd charge the other day. The first charge I did wasn't a full charge because I didn't understand how it works. When the battery is low there is a red light at the bottom where it says \"Massage.\" When you plug it in only that red light goes on. No blinking or meter to show you how far along you are. Just keep charging it until the light turns off. It does show you a meter using white lights of how much charge you have left though which is helpful.Toothpaste gets in the cracks and crevices as you can see by the white residue. I cleaned it out once but it just builds up again. There are colors on the replacement brush heads which if you were sharing I guess would help you. You can long press the button to turn it off in the middle of a 2 minute run. It auto shuts off after 2 minutes.4 stars because I think the number of included heads is deceptive. Also the size of the neck on the heads needs to get smaller. It will sometimes hit my teeth and vibrate against them as I'm getting to harder to reach places. That's annoying. I would buy from this brand again if the price was right. I think I'm officially an electric toothbrush convert at this point.",
