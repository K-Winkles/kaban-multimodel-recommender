I find the Fremouth brushes awkward in my hand -- it's difficult to reposition your hold on the fat handle and not easy to change your grip as you move the brush around your mouth. I've used only two so far. The first one became less than firm after only 9 or 10 days (the bristles at the top of the brush had spread out, as compared to the new one).",
