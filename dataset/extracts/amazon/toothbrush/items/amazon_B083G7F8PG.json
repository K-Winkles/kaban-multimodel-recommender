                "reviewText": "I have never heard of this brand before, but after 2 years my Oral-b electric toothbrush broke on me and I needed a new one. My husband had a Philips toothbrush and was lookin for a new one as well. I like that this brand has a his and her dock. That helps reduce a tangled cord mess for two toothbrushes. The UV light is a nice feature also. I don\u2019t know how much sanitization it does, but the blue light is cool at least. I haven\u2019t had a sonic toothbrush in many years so it was a little odd to get used to. Though, I do feel like it cleans my teeth better than my old toothbrush. It is a lot more gentle than an electric toothbrush and I love the 5 different brush head modes. I would certainly recommend this brand if you are looking for a new toothbrush and a cheaper price. It\u2019s shocking how expensive the name brands can get when this is a daily item everyone needs",

The different settings it has and the battery life is absolutely amazing! I would probably say one of my most favorite things about this toothbrush set is the ultraviolet rays it has for sanitizing your toothbrush head after each brushing. We don't typically see or know all of the germs and bacteria from our mouths.. most people just change toothbrushes and throw away their old ones. But knowing that my brush head was sanitized for me after each brushing just really makes me feel SO CLEAN. I don't think that I can ever go back. The toothbrushes are also so comfortable and easy to hold! I love the material they are covered in. Def slim line and yeah, I couldn't ever go back now to a regular toothbrush!!",

After my last generation Duo lasted several years and two homes, it was time for an upgrade. The Duo Series Pro is an excellent sonic toothbrush set that provides everything you and your parter need: two handles (one black and one white), 10 pro brush heads, two travel cases, and a well made base that sanitizes and charges the toothbrushes. It also has four modes to select from: clean, soft, whiten, and massage, and a smart timer that ensures you brush for the appropriate duration.The Duo Series Pro toothbrush is both powerful and gentle. It has a 40,000 VPM sonic motor that cleans my teeth effectively and comfortably. The new pro brush heads are soft and flexible, larger than the previous iteration, and conform to the shape of my teeth and gums. They remove up to 10 times more plaque than a manual toothbrush (at least that\u2019s what my dentist tells me). The base has been upgraded as well, as it includes a UV light that eliminates 99.99% of germs on the brush heads, and keeps the toothbrushes fully charged after each use.The Duo Series Pro toothbrush is also stylish and user-friendly. It has a sleek and ergonomic design that fits well in my hand. The handles have a matte finish that prevents slipping, and the two buttons are responsive and intuitive. The travel cases are sturdy and convenient, and they protect the toothbrushes from damage. The Duo Series Pro toothbrush is a very well made electric toothbrush that appears to be on par with the more expensive models on the market, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their oral health and hygiene. It is well worth the price, considering the quality, durability, and functionality of the product. The Duo Series Pro toothbrush is a great investment for your smile.",

                "reviewText": "I recently tried the AquaSonic DUO PRO \u2013 Ultra Whitening electric toothbrush, and overall, I'm quite pleased with the results and features it offers.First and foremost, the toothbrush did an excellent job of cleaning and whitening my teeth. I noticed a visible improvement in the whiteness of my smile after a few weeks of regular use. The dual brush heads provide a comprehensive cleaning experience, reaching areas that are typically hard to access with a manual toothbrush.The different cleaning modes are a great addition. I appreciate the variety they offer, from a gentle sensitive mode to a powerful deep clean mode. The built-in timer and pacer are helpful for ensuring that I brush for the recommended two minutes and evenly cover all areas of my mouth.The battery life is impressive, and I don't have to recharge it frequently. The included travel case is also handy for when I'm on the go. The design and build quality of the toothbrush feel durable and premium.However, the only drawback I found is that the replacement brush heads are a bit expensive. Nevertheless, the overall quality and performance of the AquaSonic DUO PRO make it a worthwhile investment for those looking to maintain oral health and achieve a brighter smile.",

                "reviewText": "For the price this toothbrush is amazing. Ive never owned an expensive toothbrush before but this thing gets me excited to brush. It feels like I went to the dentist with how smooth and slick my teeth feel afterwards. Great product and I hope the stay around so I can keep purchasing the brush heads. Got one for myself, and then one for wife and son. The battery life has been great (more than a week before I charged it but that was only because I wanted to use the UV cleaner). Which, is pretty cool and I guess works (I know it heats the brush heads up so that has to be doing something). It even shuts off once it's done cleaning. AMAZING PRODUCT",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this duo set for about 2 months now. It looks great, really excellent value for money considering you get 2 electric toothbrushes, 2 carry boxes, 10 replacement brushes (5 per toothbrush), a duo charger with a sealable UV light sanitiser, and a brush head hygiene protective cap!!! On top of all that; you don\u2019t have to charge it every single day like other \u201cwell known brands\u201d - the usage span after a full charge is quite long; I\u2019m talking days here when brushing twice a day! Then you add the 4 brushing speeds/modes!! Basically, you get the whole 9 yards and then some!!!! Show me a better offer elsewhere please?! \ud83d\ude02 The only thing that\u2019s a bit of a downer for me about this brush is that it\u2019s a bit too soft for me. I therefore only use the whitening mode which is faster and allows me to brush a bit harder (yes I know I\u2019m not supposed to but I\u2019m human and never said I was perfect; hard brushing works for me). Naturally, it does warn me (gotta love tech advancements) when I\u2019m brushing the same spot for too long & too hard which guides me to move on to other teeth (and come back to that spot later, of course - no way a machine can outsmart me like that \ud83d\ude02). A fantastic deal; great value for money and will keep your dental bills very low!!!!",
