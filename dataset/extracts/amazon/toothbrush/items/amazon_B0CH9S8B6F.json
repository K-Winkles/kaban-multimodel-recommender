                "reviewText": "This sonic toothbrush has exceeded my expectations in terms of simplicity and functionality. It offers different settings, allowing users to customize the brushing experience based on their preference for bristle softness. The ease of use and the affordable price make it a standout choice compared to other toothbrushes in the market.Despite its budget-friendly price point, this toothbrush doesn't compromise on quality. Priced at less than a third of similar products, it provides exceptional value for money. The package includes the toothbrush handle, a total of eight brush heads, a charging cable, and a base.The handheld unit is lightweight, making it user-friendly, though I'm curious about its long-term durability. The brush heads, falling in the soft to medium range, are ideal for those with sensitive gums and teeth. However, if you prefer a firmer brush head, this might not be the best fit.What sets this sonic toothbrush apart is the array of features it offers. Despite its affordable cost, it comes equipped with \"all the bells and whistles,\" providing a comprehensive and effective oral care solution. In summary, this product is a fantastic choice for anyone seeking a high-quality toothbrush with advanced features without breaking the bank. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Works fine, plenty of extra heads is a good value",
                "reviewText": "As some others have mentioned, there are both positives and a few negatives with this electric toothbrush, but overall I think it's a good value if you're looking for an electric (non-spinning) toothbrush, and the negatives aren't that bad if your main goal is to spend less money and still have a brush that does its job. But there are things to consider depending on your preferences and needs.The charging method isn't the greatest unless you don't mind having an adapter for USB to wall outlet in your bathroom (or wherever you're using it). However, I think that may be offset by the fact that you supposedly only have to charge it once or twice a year with the claims on battery life (but can't say if that's true or not yet). If so, you can charge it once and keep it wherever you want without having to worry about that for quite a while, at least, even if you wanted to charge it a little more often than what is supposedly necessary.The vibration on sensitive mode for me felt very ticklish at first, but once I got past that (during one use) it wasn't really bothersome. I don't really see the point in a couple of the brush modes, such as the intermittent pulsing mode versus just letting it be continuous, as I'm not sure if that adds any benefit for cleaning.The brush bristles are very, very soft, so even with the vibration and hand brushing at the same time, I didn't find it to be irritating even on my sensitive areas. The brush head is very small, and I find the item listing a bit confusing because it says for Adults in one part and then for children in another. How small the brush head is definitely made me feel like it's for children, but the listing photos show an adult using it. I have rather small teeth though so for me the size wasn't really an issue. Holding the brush for me also felt fine. My hands are small. I didn't find it difficult not to press buttons while using it, either.I don't like that you have to cycle through the modes to turn the brush off. I'd rather the power button be separate than the mode cycle button. Another downside is that the brush does not come with any case or covers for the toothbrush head, so if you do want to travel with it you'll have to find something to put it in to keep it clean.The fact that it comes with multiple replacement heads adds to the value of this product, so if nothing else is a deal breaker for you, that also helps to counteract the drawbacks.",

I was skeptical at first since it wasnt your usual Oral-B or Philips branded toothbrush but i decided to try it out based on how cheap it was. SO far, it works great, very nice to have several different settings and it vibrates like crazy! The battery life is nothing to write about but is on-par with an entry level Philips or Oral-B toothbrush so cant complain too much. Overall i recommend for the price!",

I also love the different clean settings that this toothbrush has. My favorite setting is the \"whitening\" setting. I was amazed with how clean my teeth felt after using this toothbrush for the first time. Felt just like I came from the dentist. I highly recommend this toothbrush and for the price, you cannot beat it. Best of all, it comes with 8 brush heads. That's enough to last you two years!",
