Sure, they are a little more expensive than the rest of the field, but they are worth every penny in that if you practice good dental hygiene with them, your visits to the dentist will be less often.

Once I do this, I can go to town with this particular toothbrush. Most of the new brushes out there have small skinny heads that have poor surface coverage, it doesn't feel as effective. It's a hard brush to find as well. It blows away the more expensive top shelf brushes. When I do locate this brush, I buy a bunch of them.",
