                "reviewText": "Pros*Powerful*Good grip*Lightweight*Easy and convenient charging base*Long and thin handle is surprisingly good for reaching the back of my tongue without making me gag too much.Cons*Cleaning modes seem gimmicky but do work well as power settings if you don't like the more powerful setting.*The brush head doesn't make full contact with the base. There's a tiny gap that wasn't there in my older Pro 100. This doesn't seem to affect the functionality at all, nor does it feel loose. It's more of an aesthetic issue.*The pressure indicator should be more noticeable, maybe there should be an LED indicator. Right now, it's supposed to be a pulsation, but it almost sounds like a change of pitch. Sometimes it's hard to tell if it's making that sound.This is replacing my 4 year old Oral B Pro 100 electric toothbrush that uses AA batteries. What I was able to notice right away was how easy it was to charge. It's almost like a magnetic charger, without any exposed metal bits that could corrode. The 3 power modes are useful, but I mainly use the most powerful setting or daily clean mode, although in that setting is harder to notice the pressure indicator, which is basically like a pulsating noise and sensation that changes when you put too much pressure on it. The second power setting makes it more noticeable, that's supposed to be the sensitive mode. The third power setting or the whitening mode has a stronger pulsating or hammering sensation, this mode slows down, then ramps up again, but in average it seems a little slower than the Pro 100 at full charge. I don't know if it actually whitens the teeth though, I think it's just a gimmick. For $40 I can fully recommend this.",

                "reviewText": "I've used both the Sonicare and the Oral B and while either is a huge step up from manual toothbrushes, I get better check-ups with the Oral B. My cleanings now usually only take about 30 minutes in and out. There's very little tartar that needs to be removed and my gums are in good shape. I must add, however, that I also use the waterpik flosser which I think greatly helps. I've seen some negative comments about having to tap the power button a few times to get it to turn off, but that shouldn't be a surprise since the description mentions the 3 brushing modes. I do wish it would automatically shut off after the 2 minutes like the Sonicare does. I also like the variety of brush heads that are available for the Oral B brushes. Overall I would highly recommend this toothbrush. I know both the Sonicare and Oral B offer several models of toothbrushes, but this basic model does a fine job and I see no need to upgrade.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the Oral-B Pro 1000 for a little while now, and I've got to say, it's pretty good! My teeth definitely feel cleaner since I switched to using it, and I think my smile is a bit brighter too.The toothbrush is easy to use, which is a big plus for me. It has this one button that turns it on and off, and it sort of pulses every 30 seconds to let you know to move to a different part of your mouth.It also comes with a charger, and the battery life seems pretty decent. I don't have to charge it too often, which is convenient. The design is sleek and looks nice on my bathroom counter, not too bulky or anything.The reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is because, while it works great, i don\u2019t love how small the head is and I kind of feel like the proportions are weird in my hand. Also, I wish it came with more than one brush head to start off with. It would be nice to try out different kinds without having to buy them separately right away.Overall, though, it\u2019s s a solid choice if you're looking to upgrade from a manual toothbrush without getting too fancy. It cleans well, is easy to use, and the charge lasts a while. Definitely a good buy in my book!",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical to switch from sonicare to oral b given how basic this seemed to be, but I have no regrets so far. Sonicare is good in terms of cleaning in between gums but I always could not get my teeth white. After trying oral b, it is way different as it gets in the corners of your teeth and it does a polish kind of brushing so my teeth seem to be whiter. For this basic model its actually pretty great as its basic in terms of one button to push (although it has 3 modes you can switch between) the first mode seems strong enough yet gentle for my teeth and gums. As for noise, many were saying it was loud, but honestly it was not. My sonicare made a more annoying whining noise than this, so I'm happy and can't complain about the noise. Battery life seems basic but just put it in the charger every few days or so. Only thing I didn't like is that I can never tell when to stop brushing, as my sonicare would turn itself off, but this one gives gentle haptic feedback, but doesn't really turn off after the full 2 minutes. So I really can't tell if it wants me to switch brushing areas or stop brushing. But overall this was a great switch so far and I'll be sticking with oral b so far.",

When I purchased this, I was half expecting to send it back. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this one works and cleans my teeth. The head that comes with this toothbrush was too hard, so I purchased replacement heads for sensitive teeth. I still soak them in hot water before using, but they are much softer and easier on my teeth. If you are planning on purchasing this, I recommend the softer bristle heads.",

                "reviewText": "My old, very dependable, long serving Oral \"B\" electric toothbrush suddenly died on me last week and I needed a replacement. Looking up the ratings on the recent crop of Oral \"B\" electric brushes, this Pro 100 model was rated as the best overall value. True, it doesn't have a Bluetooth connection - why do I need my toothbrush to communicate with my computer? - nor does it have the full range of brushing options, but what it does do, cleans your teeth, is perfectly fine.The toothbrush has two or three (I believe) scrubbing speeds; it has a two minute timer (the recommended amount of time to brush) and it is light and comfortable in the hand. It is not at all noisy nor does it vibrate. If I had a complaint after a few days of use, it would be that the body of the toothbrush will easily slip out of your hands if it gets wet, as is to be expected. There are no grooves or slightly rough surfaces as there were on my older model to counter this tendency, so try to avoid dribbling on the body of the brush and you will be fine.A bit pricey in Canada, but being an Oral \"B\" model, I was not too chuffed at the cost.
