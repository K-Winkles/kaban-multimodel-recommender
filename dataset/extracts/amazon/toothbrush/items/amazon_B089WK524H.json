The best thing is: they arrived less than a day after our order was placed...and delivered by the USPS! We cancelled a previous order from a different vendor because that order would not arrive for three weeks. Kudos to EcoFox LLC. and the Post Office. For the Saint Vincent de Paul Society.",

The tooth brushes them selves are in perfect condition. All 25 are there and all are individually packaged and well sealed. Came to about 60 cents a toothbrush and they are every bit as good as any 3 dollar tooth brush you get from the grocery store. Excellent savings...will last my household quite awhile. Love that there are five each of five different colors so everyone knows whos is whos.",
