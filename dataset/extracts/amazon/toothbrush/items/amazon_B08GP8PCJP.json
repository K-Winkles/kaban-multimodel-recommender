The wavy toothbrush design is more suitable for teeth and has no sanitary corners. The comfortable handle design can better adapt to the fingers, prevent excessive force and damage the gums, and gently care for the gums.",

                "reviewText": "I just RAN to Amazon to review this toothbrush. I've had an awful relationship with my teeth my whole life, starting from when I had braces and headgear as a kid. I am autistic and suffer from some pretty frustrating sensory issues, but I never really considered my mouth to be a part of that. I had orthodontists and dentists all over me for several years, so I figured that was the reason why I developed severe dentalphobia. The minute I graduated, I swore off the dentist. That was a decade ago.Brushing my teeth has always been a chore, and a miserable one at that. I would go long periods without brushing just because I hated it so much, and I could never put a finger on why. I thought recently that maybe it was the stinging sensation of mint toothpaste, so I went on Amazon to get a gentler toothpaste and just threw this toothbrush in the cart as a recommended item.I seriously started tearing up the moment I started brushing with it. It was so much better. No prickliness, no stabbing at my gums, no scratchy noise that seemed to always be too loud. It was softer, quieter. It didn't bother my sore gums at all. I told my husband, it feels like brushing my teeth with velvet, as weird as that sounds. I can't even believe what a difference it made.It was a pretty emotional experience for me because I never realized that this is how easy it could've been all my life. That this is how other people manage to brush their teeth without it being such a miserable experience. This is the first time in almost fifteen years that I've felt like maybe I can have a normal, healthy relationship with my teeth. I will ONLY be using this brush from now on.",

It is a much more comfortable experience than brushing with a normal brush.Note: if you have dentures or invisalign, these are very good brushes for cleaning them! Very gentle.",

                "reviewText": "I got these for my mom, who I was taking care of in her last years. She hated having her teeth brushed. Regular toothbrushes, like the kind you buy at the local drugstore are fine for most of us, but even the kind labeled \u2018extra soft\u2019 were too harsh for my mother\u2019s aging teeth. I tried all kinds of options: the little brushes for cleaning between your teeth, silicone baby brushes that you slip onto your finger, those hospital lollipop wedge things that come in plastic wrappers. I even tried Q-tips. Then one day out of boredom I tried some random word that I can\u2019t even remember in the search on Amazon and found these. I gave them a try. They\u2019re the only toothbrushes that didn\u2019t make my mother scream and cry during tooth brushing. They\u2019re nice and soft, and do a good job of holding their shape.",

                "reviewText": "These are very soft. They are so tightly packed that the best they can accomplish is a polished surface but due to the tightly packed bristles they can't work between the teeth at all. If your goal is to polish the front and back surface of your teeth, then this is your weapon. But good teeth cleaning is much more about getting in and around the gums and between the teeth and into any small crevises. This brush can NOT do that. I think it is anti educational for those seeking healty mouths.I also noticed, as I was attempting to work between my teeth, that a few of the fine bristles dislodged and end up in my mouth. They are so fine that I can't imagine how uncomfortable it would be to swallow one of these as I think it would be difficult to dislodge. Last complain is when I did use it to polish the interior surface of my front teeth it slipped multiple times and jabbed the inside where my lips and gum meet, which for some will guarentee a canker sore! I think the handle contributes to this issue. It is so thin and difficult to hold while applying any pressure. SO, not a fan of the idea and feel bad for people who love this so much without realizing how much they are missing by cleaning between their teeth with a brush, which is a well kept secret evidently.",

                "reviewText": "Revolutionary toothbrush. The small head let\u2019s you get in and around your entire tooth surface unlike any traditional toothbrush. Brush in circles. Brush side to side. Brush up and down. If you feel rough plaque with your tongue simply concentrate on that area every time you brush and eventually it will feel smoother.After each use it\u2019s important to rinse the bristles under running water and to spread the bristles far apart with a finger and rinse clean all the way down to the bottom. Then I dry the handle and bristles with a paper towel. I use two toothbrushes a day: the white one in the morning and the black one at night.I\u2019ve had my first set for 2 months and have not had any issues with yellowing or foul smells.The top surfaces of my molars used to have stains in the crevices. With a bit of attention with these toothbrushes the stains have lightened substantially. You don\u2019t need to push down hard, just let the bristles do their thing. These manual toothbrushes have cleaned my teeth better than any expensive battery toothbrush. I brush in zones making sure I get every surface. These toothbrushes are a delight to use. Very gentle on your gums yet tenacious on your teeth. They are my new tooth brushing super power.( btw, my husband is a dentist.)",

Then after a year and a half of usage I noticed my teeth got super sensitive to heat and cold. Now my enamel has been rubbed off and my teeth are ruined. The dentist doesn\u2019t think a toothbrush would cause it, but that is the only change I made in my oral care. My partner also has sensitive teeth now, so we are throwing these away. Do your longterm self a favor and absolutely do not buy these products.",
