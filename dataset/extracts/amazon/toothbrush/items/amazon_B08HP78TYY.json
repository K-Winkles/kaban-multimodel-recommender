                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve spent big bucks on all kinds of brushes over the years, I brush on average 6 times a day and in my opinion, this brush by REACH works absolutely perfectly for my needs, I use a brush for 1 month and toss it and start new again. It\u2019s great for control of bacteria and at my dentist office they can\u2019t believe what awesome home care I accomplish using these brushes. Nearly 0 build up on my teeth except in extremely hard to get to spots and no decay anymore gums are very healthy and I wish I had gotten this serious about my dental health when I was younger than today.. I have a beautiful smile extremely white brute teeth but I wasn\u2019t very disciplined early in life and it\u2019s true.. one does look back \u2026 anyone can do as I\u2019ve done with my mouth and this very inexpensive tooth brush!",
