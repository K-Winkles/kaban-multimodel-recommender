Another one ended up with this gross odor, I think because the bristles are very tightly packed so they weren't getting cleaned well enough in-between them, and I do clean my toothbrushes before and after I brush.Don't recommend AT ALL. I recommend the Nimbus toothbrushes for a soft bristle toothbrush, I have repurchased those many times!",

I should\u2019ve gone with my first instinct that they weren\u2019t going to work. I guess I\u2019ll go back and buy the ones I bought previously. They were much better, at least they get between my teeth. Thought I wanted to try a new one. Lesson learned.I hope this review makes sense.I would return them but obviously I\u2019ve used one of the pack so that\u2019s not possible.",
