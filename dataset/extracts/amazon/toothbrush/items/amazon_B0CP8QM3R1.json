Many of the brand name electronic toothbrushes Were very expensive.When I saw this one. I thought just try it.Now, I am so glad I did.. I was impressed that it was beautifully packaged and came with multiple replacement brushes whereas the expensive brands make you purchase brushes separately. The charger is included which I plugged into my laptop, and eventually used an AC adapter, which also charged very easily.I\u2019ve only charged it twice since I\u2019ve had it and it\u2019s still works perfectly and holds the charge. My teeth now feel very fresh and clean after using, with a Squeeky clean feeling. I am really very happy with this toothbrush. if you\u2019re thinking about it, just do it, you won\u2019t be sorry in my opinion.",

                "reviewText": "I had an expensive, brand name sonic toothbrush, but my teeth didn't feel clean almost immediately after brushing. But I really liked the 2-minute timer feature. While on vacation I tried a battery operated spin brush and found that it did a better job than the sonic brush. Not wanting to spend a lot of money only to be disappointed, I searched for a spin brush with timer feature. This brush meet all my requirements, was very reasonably priced, and had great reviews. I've been using the brush for about a month and I'm very pleased with the job it does. And it comes with a great supply of refill brushes. I'm very pleased with this product.",

If you are contemplating purchasing an expensive electric toothbrush, save your money and give this a shot. After using this product my teeth feel as clean and fresh as ever. It comes with 8 heads, and the battery life is fantastic. I charged it once after opening and 2 weeks later still going. This product is also designed by a small business owner in the U.S. which is great if you wanna support small business owners. For $20 this is a steal and you shouldn\u2019t hesitate to order.",
