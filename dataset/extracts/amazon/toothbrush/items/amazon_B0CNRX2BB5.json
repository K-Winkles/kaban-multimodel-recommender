                "reviewText": "Our household has been using Colgate products for years now and have been using these Colgate 360 Advanced Optic White toothbrushes for a while as well! These are the same as the older ones, just a \u201cnew look\u201d!We really like them! These specific ones are medium and come in a 4 pack. They really work well, we won\u2019t use any other brand for toothbrushes! They clean well (the best besides an electric toothbrush and personally, I prefer these over an electric toothbrush)!These are supposed to help your teeth stay white. They won\u2019t whiten them, but will keep them at the whiteness you\u2019re currently at (you\u2019ll need whitening strips or a treatment to get them whiter than they are). BUT, if you have been using the wrong toothbrush(es) that really haven\u2019t been cleaning your teeth well enough, these definitely may help your teeth appear whiter!The cheek and tongue cleaner are a bonus! Love them both!These toothbrushes last a while! Comfortable to hold! We have been ordering these for a long time and will continue to after these 4 are done! Definitely recommend!",

I took one with me on vacation and expected to toss it as we prepared to leave. But, I liked it so much, I brought it home!These scrub really, really well! You are going to get that super clean feeling that you might experience with an electric toothbrush! And the handle is so solid and so grippy!The back of the toothbrush has those little nubs that are great for brushing your tongue. And, I love the clear resin that runs through this. Very aesthetically cool!If you are buying these for a trip, be ready ... I don't think you will be able to part with them! Highly recommended!",

First, the head is definitely very unique compared to the dentist-supplied toothbrushes I've been using. It leaves my mouth feeling cleaner. Second, a lot of thought went into this brush in that even the back of the head is textured so it can be used as a tongue scraper. While I normally prefer an electric brush, when traveling or late at night when I don't want to disturb the family I use a manual brush. I can definitely say I'll be sticking to this one at those times from now on.",

                "reviewText": "No complaints with these brushes. The bristle head is very soft and is easy on your gums, and still gets your teeth clean. Quality of the bristles is pretty good, they don't bend and lean apart at all after just a few brushes (or if you're like me and just heavy-handed!). The sharp indents on the ends make brushing in the crevices slightly better. The brush heads clean pretty good even if you rinse under the faucet, and don't stain at all. Grip on the handle is more comfortable and it fits most toothbrush holders if that interests you. Definitely not for kids, the handle is simply too much for them. But I like these, sometimes Colgate brushes are a huge miss yet these work better than expected.",

The dual-sided silicone grips and stylish, ergonomic handle design are also nice touches. The whole \"whiter smile\" claim seems kinda hollow and they're not ideal for those with sensitive gums, but it's one of the best manual toothbrushes for the average person.",

The bristles on this have both round areas to help polish your teeth, that is, remove stains, and longer bristles to help remove particles that get in awkward spots.

                "reviewText": "Fairly priced, and high quality. I usually use an electric toothbrush but sometimes I'll use a manual, like when it needs to be recharged or if I'm on vacation. These fit the bill nicely and seem better than the cheap ones you get from the dentist for free. Comfortable handle, and substantial bristles. Would purchase again!",
