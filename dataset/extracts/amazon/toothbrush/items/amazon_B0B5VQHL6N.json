                "reviewText": "Does it work? Absolutely and better than the dentist it feels like sometimes.Is it easy to setup snd use, yes, almost too essy. Switching the mode on the brush itself was the trickiest part but that's essy also.Is it worth the fresking $200? Absolutely, if you're thinking about this purchase, do it, and if you regret it let me know. I don't as skeptical to buy one for me and one for my wife, that's an expensive purchase, but reading tons of reviews on different brands and brushes, I just dove into it hoping it was what others said it was... and it is, for me and my wife, we both agree, it's amazing!Your mouth will feel and smell cleaner. If you're a tooth, gum, tongue, roof of mouth, and lip brusher like my OCD self is then you're going to love me for telling you to GET THIS BRUSH.I also smoke, drink coffee, and eat lots of chocolate... shame on me I know, but the point is I usually have slightly off white teeth bc of it and it's not noticeable really bc they ain't yellow yall, but they ain't white either This brush DOES MAKE THEM WHITE. I guess if you're scrubbing at 62,000 jiggs a second then you can get down to business.Look, this is the feeling. You know how we imagine how it was like without electricity or how our kids imagine life without internet, after you brush eith this for a week you're gonna have that same feeling about a regular toothbrush.BTW, the app part is cool even though I don't care about that crap but they made it so easy to use it that you almost feel guilty not to. It does give you good information and feedback.Also, if you're new to eletric brushes, don't scrub, glide the brush across the surface, use the proper angles, and don't press too hard This brush won't let you press too hard actually, and that's it. Let the brush do the work snd enjoy that clean fresh mouth when it's done.",

                "reviewText": "I can definitely feel the difference in power with this brush over my 30 dollar one I had previously (though I think this one is still overpriced for what it is). Only issue I have is for some reason it won't charge on my bathroom outlet but works on other ones so I have to move it to another room when the battery gets low for charging. Minor inconvenience but the base design itself is kinda crappy with the removable plastic.",

                "reviewText": "This is my third Sonicare brush. The first one was a 1000 second was a 7000. I always assumed the series # were just marketing tactics and the handles were all the same. This is not the case. The 1000 is basically a manual brush, I would never recommend it. The 7000 was outstanding, I used it for four years before I decided to buy my girlfriend her own and decided to upgrade slightly to the 9000. I order two, not because my 7000 needed to be replaced but so I could connect to the app which Ive heard was pretty great. Needless to say Im very pleased with the app although Im sure it's a luxury Ill use for a month then completely forget about. However the handle itself feels like a sledgehammer compared to the 7000. My teeth feel like I just left the dentist everytime I brush. I took the next step and linked my account to my Alexa which reorders brush heads when due. About every 85 days. I'll be buying these for my entire family come Xmas. Remarkable product",

                "reviewText": "So this happened to my old diamond clean but only after 4 years. This one broke in less than 6 months and past return of course. The vibrations losen a tiny screw that holds the head in place and the brush head pole losens and has no vibration. The only online fix is to tighten the screw but vibrations unscrew it. Why would you make a toothbrush with a scre to hold the inside of the head in place that vibrations can unscrew. Probably planned obsolescence. Get a cheap one they don't make them like they used to waste of a couple hundo will never go back to diamond clean.",

                "reviewText": "I opened this package, and was dazzled by the elegance of the base. However, I've been fooled by such shiny distractions before. When I first put it in my mouth i knew this one was different. The head was bigger than I'm used to, but it had, almost, a soft bumpered edge to it, so even if I did slip a little there was no discomfort. I have only used the clean+ setting so far, because it lasts the right amount of time, on its conveniently timed cycles, to leave me feeling confident that my mouth is spotlessly clean. The intensity is spot on. It's not so strong on the highest setting that I can't handle the force, it's gentle still, but voracious. Charge holds great, plus the base is heavy enough to not get banged around to easily. The only issue I have, is personal, if I slip it out of my mouth too soon, it will spray all over my face in a high intensity spatter, but I don't mind, it just reminds me of it's power. Highly recommend.",
