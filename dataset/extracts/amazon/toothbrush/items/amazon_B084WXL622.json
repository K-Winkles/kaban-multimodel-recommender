They are also very good for those with sensitive teeth and gums. Painful brushing makes one not want to brush their teeth properly, making dental health problems worse. These brushes are so soft they really feel very good, especially on and under the gums. These toothbrush bristles feel like the face brushes with the very fine bristles usually in a wavy pattern as well, except these bristles are finer. A great (and low cost) purchase for your oral health.",

                "reviewText": "I had to pull several teeth due to medical conditions. My gums were so sore and anything that I put on it other than gauze would bleed. So I found this online and saw that it had many great reviews. I\u2019m so glad I did because this is been a lifesaver for me to get through this. Really soft and I\u2019d like the covers that come with it.",

                "reviewText": "More pros than cons\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffcI have to start by saying i gave this inly 4 stars because its so soft it'll wear out pretty fast (probably needs replaced monthly) but I LOVE this toothbrush. I have had very healthy teeth my entire life, i didnt get my first cavity until after I had my first child. But ive since struggled finding a toothbrush soft enough for my gums. Even \u201csensitive\u201d brand name toothbrushes would feel like sandpaper on my gums and I dreaded brushing my teeth. But this toothbrush changed everything. SO SOFT that I literally teared up when i used it because my brushing experience was so gentle. (Its a big deal to me lol)Im not sure if there are any better ones out there, this is the first one of the \u201cnano\u201d toothbrushes ive ever tried. It does go soft and the bristle spread flat pretty quickly since its SUCH a soft brush. But because of all those tiny bristles you get an exceptionally shiny clean. I have to emphasize just how clean this toothbrush gets your teeth! And ZERO pain.Honestly even if i have to buy this toothbrush twice as often as i used to its absolutely worth it to me hands down. Apparently you are supposed to replace your toothbrush every month anyways.... i never got that memo. But this tooth brush will probably only last about a month and then itll need replaced.I love it so much i bought one for our whole family. Our 3 kids range from 5-2 yrs and they all are in love with these tooth brushes!!!!! Worth it!",

                "reviewText": "I bought these for me and my boyfriend to try. We have been using the curved top black and white toothbrushes for about 5 days now. I am in love with it, my teeth and gums are very sensitive and I'm prone to mouth ulcers, but this tooth brush means you can brush your teeth and gums (it's important to brush your gums too!) without damaging them. I have found it takes a bit longer to brush your teeth as you have to go slower and in smaller motions with all the thin bristles. Its a different style of brushing your teeth to how im used to, but I always had a preference for soft brushes. My boyfriend isn't quite as keen as me, before this he always used hard bristle brushes. If you're used to/enjoy brushing with hard bristles then this may not be the brush for you, it feels more like you are polishing your teeth than actually brushing.I've attached a pic of my toothbrush after 5 days brushing. The bristles have separated a little bit but it doesn't effect the brushing, although it might indicate that this brush won't last as long. The second pic is what the packaging generally looks like, although it seems like you get the 2 curved brushes and the 2 flat top brushes from slightly different brands - their packaging is very similar though. Overall this is good value and a great alternative to the expensive 'silko' toothbrush I've been advertised.",
