They are not available in any local stores so finding these on Amazon was great. These brushes are ultra soft and make a tremendous difference in cleaning my teeth well because they are softer than any other \"soft\" toothbrush that is sold. Since they are easy on the gums, all tooth surfaces can be cleaned without fear of pain or bleeding. The price was more than reasonable and I know I definitely will be ordering more!",
