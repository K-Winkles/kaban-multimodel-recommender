                "reviewText": "The handle part is metal which makes it so it is very sturdy and doesn\u2019t bend during brushing which makes the soft bristles more effective. I have very sensitive gums and this doesn\u2019t irritate them at all. So it\u2019s great for fellow gingivitis sufferers. The shape of the handle also gives great control, better than a traditional shape in my opinion. It fits perfectly against your thumb. Not sure what makes the brush \u201cwhitening\u201d but that isn\u2019t my goal. I don\u2019t feel so bad about throwing away a brush head any more. I like that. One thing that may be bad if you are giving it to kids, is that the end of the handle is a bit pointed. This may be an issue in some scenarios. But overall, I do believe I\u2019ve finally found my perfect toothbrush. If you\u2019re hesitating because of the price, don\u2019t. It\u2019s totally worth it.",

The base is comfortable in the hand, has a little weight to it (which is nice) opposed to a lightweight cheap plastic. I find it very convenient you can change and replace the heads at any time and keep your base for as long as you\u2019d like ! This toothbrush is way better than regular plastic toothbrushes, and will last you much longer; I would definitely recommend.",
