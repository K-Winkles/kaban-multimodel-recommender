I've been looking for tooth brushes like this for years because they don't make good thick ones like when I was younger. Out of the box, yes, you could use one to clean tile grout!. Perhaps that's a secondary use to buy them but they work on teeth too. The first week you have to brush lightly with them. After that they soften up enough but still remain firm. They work amazingly, the best tooth brush I've found in over 20 years! My teeth are noticeably cleaner from just regular brushing than they been in a long time. The brushes get deep down into the gum area like a floss too. Highly recommended and the package of 8 will last a LONG time because they don't soften up too much and go flat.",

These get way back in the very back of my top and bottom rows of teeth. The bristles are a bit longer than regular bristles. I was not expecting this toothbrush to be as firm and easy to use. I have arthritis in my hands, so the toothbrush being large helps me to navigate around in my mouth. Im happy that I ordered the 5 pack (i think), I gave one to my caregiver-roommate-supervisor.Im still using my original toothbrush, very firm-Love these!Excellent Product!!!",
