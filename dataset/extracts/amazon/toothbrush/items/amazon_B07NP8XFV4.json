                "reviewText": "8/2023I wanted a bigger toothbrush head, maybe 3 times the usual size. This is more like 6 times the usual size. It's a very big mouthful. A much bigger head means that to press the bristles into the teeth with the same amount of force as you did with the traditional, little toothbrush, you have to push a little harder with your hand. Theoretically, the chunkier handle should make it easier to deliver force from your hand to the toothbrush head.I like to regulate the pressure that I press on my teeth with the toothbrush. In this Radius toothbrush, the thinner part of the handle flexes to assure the pressure does not exceed a certain amount. But sometimes, I'd have liked to press a little harder. Perhaps the toothbrush is smarter than me, and I should take its advice. Maybe I should always strive to flex the handle to assure I'm always exerting the proper force, as determined by Radius.The handle also has some zig-zags. I'm used to approaching my teeth with an angle determined by my arm and hand. So after a week, I'm still getting used to approaching my teeth with the strange zig-zags of this toothbrush handle.After a week, I'm still getting used to this toothbrush, trying to decide if I'll stick with it or dispose of it. The promise is getting the process, which I was never enthusiastic about, done faster with the toothbrush's huge head. So I'll keep using this toothbrush until I get used to it or give up.Least importantly, if you were ever able to hold a conversation while brushing your teeth with a traditional, little toothbrush, you won't be able to utter a single syllable anymore with a mouthful of this one.2/2024I signed up for a subscription, and my 2nd Radius toothbrush should be arriving this month. I'm still using it, no plans on giving it up. It's still a mouthful. And the default 6-month replacement seems just right; thanks.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s our first time using one of these toothbrushes. Saw one on Shark Tank for $100. That\u2019s a bit strap for a brush that doesn\u2019t have tricks. So we opted to try this first.Due to an accident and head injury, teeth and mouth area are sensitive. So a softer brush is needed to avoid pain yet I like the clean feeling of a firmer toothbrush. This brush is definitely softer than a traditional and battery brush but not as soft as child\u2019s. The bristles are firm yet flexible. For a more visual description, it\u2019s like a car wash brush.Size - So you know this is a wide toothbrush. It takes some getting used too. While brushing you literally have a full mouth of toothbrush in there. The handle is hard for me to manage. I can\u2019t seem to find that sweet spot for holding it. It hurts my shoulder too because having to hold this differently, you use more muscles in different places. (The $100 brush has a standard handle. Hmmmm).Time - I\u2019m leaning towards less time to brush. The brush covers more surface including gums. But, without the battery operated spinning brush, you have to focus more on where you\u2019re brushing. For the roof of the mouth, cheeks and tounge, this brush is much nicer and takes less time to cover all the rounded areas inside the mouth. Points for that. I always feel like I\u2019m sawing my tongue with a normal brush. And I lose track of where I brushed to ensure full coverage so I end up redoing which takes time.Comfort - As mentioned above this takes some getting used too. 50 years of using a certain type of toothbrush, the getting used to is noticeable.Pros - Coverage area, softer brush, whole mouth clean feeling.Cons - Handle",
