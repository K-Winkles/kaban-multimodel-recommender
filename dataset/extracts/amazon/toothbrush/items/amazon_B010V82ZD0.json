                "reviewText": "This is actually my second purchase of these, after buying my first one at, well, what my mother insists my husband, children and I call \"The Store That Gramma Says Does Not Exist\", (and which we would also refuse to shop at, but with only one paycheck, and in our very small town, we don't actually have the ability to choose not to shop there, and don't unless necessary, I feel compelled to defend my family to nameless strangers, sigh) and, (she goes on breezily) these are seriously fantastic toothbrushes. Seriously. Two years ago I made a serious mistake of purchasing a whitening toothpaste with some kind of polishing beads made by Crest. My mouth reacted to that toothpaste as if it was an allergic reaction, which my mouth never was sensitive to any toothpaste in the past. The whole lining of my mouth was so swollen that it was peeling, I had several ulcers, and the underside of my tongue and gums were all bleeding. A church friend who is a dental hygenist told me that it was the microbeads, and told me to switch to an organic toothpaste, and also to use baking soda sometimes if I needed to, for whitening. Since she, who is a grandmother, has the face of a model, and more importantly here the smile and teeth of a super model, on top of her expertise, I listened, and experimented and finally got the inflammation under control just this past June, with Tea Tree Oil toothpaste with baking soda and this toothbrush combined. This toothbrush is the only one that both makes my mouth feel deeply clean all over, but does not leave my gums bleeding. My husband just went to pick a prescription at a drugstore chain, and a single one of these there was $8, so this pack of three at this price, with the wonderful added bonus of not buying from The Store That Does Exist ( while not living in a Dark Hole in a Jungle in the Rain Forest, and hearing the news of others ) ,makes this a wonderful buy. The bristles are very soft, but strong and very dense at the same time, and hold up to a good scrubbing. The handle is just perfect for my middle aged arthritic hands in the morning and evening when they are at their worst. And the black color with bright colored accents appeals to me as a visually creative person, even seeing it every day the pink color still makes me smile. And with everything going on in the world right now, if a small thing like a toothbrush that is both made so well, feels so great to use, gives such nice results, and has such spirited colors can give you a small smile each day, then what possibly more could you want from your toothbrush? I mean, sadly, it can't bring about World Peace, but more people having small things in their lives that bring them some small joys, that inspires them to give some of that joy away, you know??? And so goes the rambling mind of a 50 year old mom.",

                "reviewText": "I just discovered this toothbrush last week (where have I been?) and I must say that I like it a lot! I bought it because I thought the black bristles looked cool, not realizing it was actual charcoal bristles. It is a nice soft brush but not too soft - it doesn't sink all the way to the plastic head when you apply pressure. It fits well in my mouth which isn't giant so that is also a good thing! Here is the reason why it didn't get 5 stars from me (and I may come back to change it) - My gums were so sore on day 2! It felt like I went to the dentist and had an extreme deep cleaning. I had to take Advil because they hurt so bad. I went online and read about the brush and that is when I discovered they were charcoal bristles and that they claimed to give your gums a deep cleaning! They are definitely right! My gums and mouth felt very clean - but I wasn't too happy about the pain. Unless of course this is improving my gum health. I will continue to use it and will rerate it once I have gone to the dentist to see if my gums have in fact gotten better!",

But the very fine and soft bristles are tremendously good at polishing my teeth to slippery perfection. I prefer the results with this toothbrush to that of fancy electric toothbrushes I've tried. Have been using this toothbrush exclusively for decades.",

                "reviewText": "I always buy extra soft toothbrushes and they're usually $3ish dollars for one, so when I read the reviews on how soft these were and they were 3 for $5, I decided to try them. The bristles are very soft, but they're kind of sharp and irritate my gum line. I feel like they're so soft that I need to brush harder, which I already brush too hard according to my dentist. The handle is also a little flimsy, so it bends a little as I brush (too hard) and since the bristles are so soft, when I brush my tongue, I feel like if I have anything on there, it's just moving it around, not brushing it off. I have invisalign, so I have attachments on my teeth (it's like having the metal regular braces, but it's oddly shaped and tooth colored and only on a few teeth) and they wear my toothbrush out. I usually change brushes on the first day of the month, b/c after brushing over the attachments 2 or 3 times a day for a month, my toothbrush looks like it's been run over by a lawnmower. Well, I have used this one for 3 weeks and it still looks like the day I opened the package, so it definitely holds up well. I will put 1 under my sink as an extra one if someone needs a new one, and the other in my travel bag, but when it's time to replace the one I'm using, I'll stick with the Colgate extra soft.",
