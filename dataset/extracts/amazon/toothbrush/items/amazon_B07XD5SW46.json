They are a little more firmer that I thought they'd be when I first bought some about a year ago, but I do like their bristle setup. They are soft enough for cleaning your teeth properly and gum safe as well, just don't bear down hard which I tend to do and is not necessary for clean teeth. My periodontist cautioned me to never use the very soft post-surgery brushes on a daily basis as your main toothbrush - they are only for temporary use. I use post-surgical ones for a quick second brush and to brush my tongue since they are more gentle than a tongue brush even bearing down. All in all, I'd recommend these brushes to anyone!",
