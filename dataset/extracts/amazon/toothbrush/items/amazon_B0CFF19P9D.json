It has 3 intensity levels and 5 modes to suit different needs and preferences. I usually use the standard mode with medium intensity, and it feels like a professional cleaning every time. The toothbrush heads are very soft and gentle on my gums, and they have a color change indicator to remind me when to replace them. The battery life is amazing, as I only need to charge it once every 60 days. The charging stand is also very convenient and stable. The toothbrush is waterproof and has a sleek design that looks great in my bathroom. It also comes with a travel case and 6 extra brush heads, which is a great value for money. I would highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for a sonic toothbrush that delivers a deep and comfortable cleaning experience. It is definitely worth the 5 stars!",

The brushing experience is both gentle and effective, leaving my teeth feeling clean and refreshed.

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had a few electric toothbrushes over the years but never thought they were that great. I heard this one was good and figured I\u2019d give it a try. Wow, was I surprised! It really does a fantastic job and you can tailor it to suit your best needs. It comes with 6 brush heads, a brush head cover, wall hanger, charging stand with cord, and the unit itself. The best part is that it not only has 5 different cleaning modes, but also 3 power levels for each mode. It saves the last setting for the next use too. It\u2019s a bit tricky adjusting the modes and power, but the instructions are well written. The speed of movement is amazingly fast, which is different from others I\u2019ve tried. You do not have to keep it in the charging base, as it claims to hold a charge for 60 days and that makes it great for travel and leaving the charger behind. The quality is excellent, it does a fantastic job, and the price is great!",

The toothbrush itself is fantastic and for the quality it is an amazing price. This toothbrush has 5 different modes that change the way the toothbrush vibrates to optimize different cleaning styles. The different modes do definitely offer a different feel for what you are looking for. It has just the right amount of power to where it is very comfortable to use. I like that for the price it also comes with 6 brush heads, one of them being a different deep cleaning design. It also has an optional wall mount and a brush protector. The charging base is nice and light and does exactly what it is supposed to. Battery lasts a long time and I have had no issues with it running out since I usually put it on the charger weekly. Prior to this I used a competitor brand, and it was always really noisy. This toothbrush is actually a lot quieter and just makes a soft bussing. I highly recommend this toothbrush if you are looking for an inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush.",

The best parts: it includes multiple settings, 6 heads plus a head cap and charging station, and of course, price.The negatives are that the wall mount doesn\u2019t hold it securely (so I don\u2019t use it) and the charging station has a USB with no wall plug. We have many wall plugs at my house and they\u2019re easy to come by, but it would\u2019ve been nice to have one included.",

                "reviewText": "Thank you for the details. Here's a review for the 7MAGIC toothbrush designed for adults and teens, featuring a brushing timer and powered by corded electric with medium firmness:---i recently purchased the 7MAGIC electric toothbrush, and it has completely transformed my oral care routine. As someone who has struggled with maintaining consistent brushing habits, the built-in timer feature of this toothbrush is a godsend. It ensures that I brush for the dentist-recommended two minutes, making my brushing sessions more effective and thorough.The medium firmness of the bristles is perfect for my needs. It's gentle enough not to cause any gum irritation, yet firm enough to effectively remove plaque and surface stains. I've noticed a significant improvement in the cleanliness of my teeth and the health of my gums since I started using it.The power source being corded electric is extremely convenient. I don't have to worry about batteries running out or losing power mid-brush. The toothbrush always delivers consistent performance, which is something I value highly.One aspect that really stands out is the design. It's sleek, modern, and very easy to handle. The toothbrush feels comfortable in my hand, and maneuvering it around my mouth is effortless.In conclusion, the 7MAGIC electric toothbrush is a fantastic investment for both adults and teens. It promotes better dental hygiene habits through its timer feature, has just the right bristle firmness for effective cleaning, and its corded electric power source ensures reliability. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to upgrade their oral care routine.",
