                "reviewText": "I usually purchase Oral-B flex plus or similar designs. Amazon had a bundle and save type promotion. I think it was a 20% discount for buying at least $50 of certain Amazon brand products. Since this was on the bundle list and I was just under whatever amount it was to get the discount, I figured I would give them a try. I'm glad I did because I like them better than any I've gotten for a long time. Without the discount, I would've passed because I've been disappointed when trying anything other than my typical Oral-B toothbrush. It's also why I only started with a two-pack. But now that I know I like them, I'll buy more. Here's what I like:- Even though it's a full size head, it's soft and therefore doesn't hurt my gums, while allowing me to brush hard to reach places (ie, back of the upper back teeth).- I have soft enamel and have a bad habit of brushing too hard, so I need soft bristles. These are actually soft, yet very effective at cleaning my teeth.- The rubber that lines the outside of the bristles are awesome! For one, they massage my gums. Two, they remind me not to brush too hard. Three, they do a great job of cleaning my teeth along the gum line.I hope this helps!",
