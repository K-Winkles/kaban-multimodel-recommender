                "reviewText": "Descubrir los cepillos de dientes Oral-B Pro-Health Junior ha sido una soluci\u00f3n excelente para un problema recurrente en M\u00e9xico: la falta de cepillos de tama\u00f1o intermedio. Estos cepillos son perfectos para ni\u00f1os mayores de 6 a\u00f1os que han superado la etapa de los cepillos infantiles pero que a\u00fan no est\u00e1n listos para los de adulto. A pesar de su precio elevado debido a la importaci\u00f3n por un tercero, valen la pena por su tama\u00f1o y dise\u00f1o adecuados. Ser\u00eda ideal que Oral-B considerara distribuir estos cepillos directamente en M\u00e9xico para facilitar el acceso a un producto tan necesario. Mientras tanto, son altamente recomendables para padres que buscan la opci\u00f3n correcta para sus hijos en transici\u00f3n.",
