I found this affordable toothbrush and I've generally gotten good results from Spinbrush.Spinbrush Pro Clean is a battery powered toothbrush with soft bristles. A \"AA\" battery is included and is easily replaceable. The brush head is also replaceable and compatible with the Spinbrush Refill Pack.One cool feature here is that the color bristles start to fade when you're running out of spins. This means it's time to change the brush head.The vibration for this toothbrush is a little bit different than I am used to. Initially, I thought something might be wrong with it. However, after a couple uses I really found myself happy with the toothbrush and I found it was getting my teeth very clean. It was digging deeper and doing a nice job. It's compact and great for travel and so far I've been impressed with battery life.I also find the toothbrush very ergonomic. I have some fine motor skill issues and I can easily grip and use this toothbrush without causing any sort of spasms in my hand.Overall, I'm quite pleased and there's no doubt I will buy this toothbrush again.",

                "reviewText": "Maybe you want a toothbrush that has an app on your phone and does everything except make your coffee in the morning. I don't. This brush is simple to use and very effective. My teeth feel smooth and clean. Yes, I probably brush a bit longer than I did with a manual brush, but its all good! No - it doesn't recharge or indicate the remaining charge, but I don't want a \"docking station\" and cord/transformer as permanent fixtures on my bathroom counter! makes it more portable for travel. I have been using it for 3 weeks, 2x/day with no issues. And the brush head refills are reasonable - like the cost of a regular toothbrush. Low cost - low maintenance and effective. What more could you want?",

I would recommend it to others. I've had my old one for a long time and just upgraded to this new style. The replacement heads are so cheap and easy to replace. I buy them on amazon as well. I change them out every 3 months like you would a regular toothbrush.",
