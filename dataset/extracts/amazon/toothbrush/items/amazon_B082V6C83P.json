I still forget to brush, I'm trying to get into the habit, but I think \"few times a week\" is way better than \"never\" so it's a work in progress. Well I just want to say these are comfy and easy to use and don't make me disgusted, and since there's the 3 angles it hits from it gets the job done faster so less time suffering. I did think the bristles were a bit hard but other than that I really like the design of these!",

                "reviewText": "Soooooo, I got this toothbrush for my kiddo. It's called the \"Three Bristle Travel Toothbrush\". It's got 3 small toothbrush heads angled in such a way that allows for all sides of the tooth to be brushed simultaneously, with \"sensory safe material\" all around. Intended to cut down teeth brushing time to just about 40 seconds. Rather than 2 minutes. (Not including floss time). It is the off brand one, and with that in mind there are some negative reviews for cheaper materials used...and it's not as good as the electric competitor. Start small work up to big, right? (They have a name brand electric one that looks INSANELY cool Lol )\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f ISSUES I HAVE WITH THIS PRODUCT:The major issues I have with this product are the materials used to line the toothbrush heads. I understand the concept, fully. The need for a sturdy toothbrush head is important, however the material isn't really \"sensory safe\"...it's harder plastic with little to no bend at all. When it scrapes against your gums it hurts, a lot! Even with minimal effort it still comes into contact with it. Advice for this would be to use a different material for the heads of the toothbrushes. A softer plastic or maybe a gel-like material. The bristles are hard, they definitely get the job done but I found they irritate even my teeth if brushed too hard or fast. They are soft enough that when my son bites down on the toothbrush, the bristles don't stab or poke into his gums though, that's really good. However, making them a bit smaller in size around and more of them together might alleviate this issue with the tips angled in such a way as to avoid any sensory triggers for some.Anywho, I think after day 2 we finally are starting to get the hang of it and now and my kiddo INSISTS on brushing his teeth himself. IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR! \ud83d\ude31\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude02 The time spent on actual teeth brushing is actually longer than 40 seconds though because he likes it and is still getting the hang of it but for reals. Small miracles and tender mercies! I'll take the WIN! \ud83d\ude4c Once he gets the hang of it we are definitely going to progress to the electric one! This was a good starter for sure!#yayforcleanteeth #autismlife #autismmom #alientoothbrush #threeheads #betterthanone",

Aber mit diesen Zahnb\u00fcrsten hat sich alles zum Positiven gewendet.Die dreiseitige Form erm\u00f6glicht eine gr\u00fcndliche Reinigung von allen Seiten der Z\u00e4hne \u2013 oben, unten und an den Seiten. Das ist besonders wichtig f\u00fcr Kinder mit Empfindlichkeiten oder sensorischen Herausforderungen. Die Borsten sind weich und schonend, was das Z\u00e4hneputzen angenehmer macht.Die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Zahnb\u00fcrsten ist perfekt, nicht zu gro\u00df und nicht zu klein. Die Reiseversionen sind auch super praktisch f\u00fcr unterwegs. Mein Kind hat seine eigene Zahnb\u00fcrste jetzt immer dabei, und das beruhigt uns beide.Die bunten Farben der Zahnb\u00fcrsten machen sie zus\u00e4tzlich attraktiv und kinderfreundlich. Die Qualit\u00e4t ist gut, und sie sind langlebig. Ich bin wirklich froh, dass ich diese Zahnb\u00fcrsten entdeckt habe.Insgesamt gebe ich diesen dreiseitigen Zahnb\u00fcrsten verdiente 5 Sterne. Sie sind eine echte Erleichterung f\u00fcr das t\u00e4gliche Z\u00e4hneputzen und haben das gesamte Erlebnis f\u00fcr mein Kind positiv ver\u00e4ndert. Absolut empfehlenswert f\u00fcr Eltern, die nach einer Zahnb\u00fcrste f\u00fcr besondere Bed\u00fcrfnisse suchen!",
