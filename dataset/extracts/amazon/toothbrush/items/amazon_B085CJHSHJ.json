I've been using regular \"soft\" toothbrushes from the Grocery store for most of my adult life until once by chance I accidentally brought home an extra soft tooth brush i found in a clearance bin at an Amish store. It was a game changer! Until I realized that once the tooth brush wore out I couldn't find it's equal. Going back to regular grocery store Tooth brushes was not an option. On top of that, my gums started getting really sensitive after my 4th pregnancy. After seeing an ad on Instagram for similar yet much more expensive Tooth brushes I checked on Amazon and they had ones that looked the same for half the price. I didn't want to spend extra. . For something that may not even solve my problem. They are reasonably priced, hold up well, and are like a massage for my gums instead of little pieces of barbed wire that Normal tooth brushes feel like in comparison",

The biggest drawback is the size. I have a small mouth and it is a bit bulky. So I don\u2019t think this one would be good for kids. I love that they come with a plastic storage box. It makes it easy to get each toothbrush out and store the rest for later. I will buy them again if I can\u2019t find my first choice.",

They are soft and they do a nice job cleaning the teeth.Been using 1 since the first of August and it is in great shape.I would recommend to people that want a soft toothbrush and find the ones on the market still too hard to use. Will even offer some to my sisters who cannot seem to find a decent one on the market that they think is actually soft.The only downside is that the back of the toothbrush has something for cleaning the tongue. When you brush your teeth it rubs the inside of your mouth which for me hurts after a few brushes so I have to stop using it.They really need to get rid of this. If they want you to have something to clean your tongue, they should just add to the container a tongue brush as this really makes a very good and hardy toothbrush unusaable.",
