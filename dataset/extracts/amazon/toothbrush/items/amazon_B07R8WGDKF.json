                "reviewText": "I bought this electric toothbrush a few months ago because it was on a good sale. It took me awhile to get around to even using. I wish I had replaced my old manual toothbrush on day one. This toothbrush is a modern miracle. The instructions said to charge the toothbrush (internal lithium ion battery) for at least 24 hours. However, if the duration of how long the \"red light\" stays lit on the handle of the device is any indication of how long it took to actually fully charge the battery then it may not take a full 24 hours to charge. Anyway, that point aside...The toothbrush worked just fine and the vibrations are so quick that they come off as feeling smooth. When this toothbrush touches the lips it can cause a tickling sensation. I was literally smiling multiple times because I wanted to laugh from the tickling sensations when it touched my lips.Any product that you buy that causes you to literally smile has to be a good thing.And now that I finally switched back to an electric toothbrush (this isn't my first) I am very happy with this product and find myself even brushing 2 to 3 times a day versus only one because of how easy it is and how it makes me feel.Now, since I've only been using this toothbrush less than a week I won't make any comments regarding durability or longevity. But rest assured, my first impressions are very positive. And I look forward to using this product for a very long time.To have received an electric toothbrush that is as light as a feather and comes with 8 total replacement toothbrush heads is very nice. I am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality electric toothbrush.I will update this review if my viewpoints change over time.",

The charge on it is amazing. This is by far the best electric toothbrush with a great price. Don't buy the toothpaste with it. The toothpaste does not work good at all. Colgate total mint stripe works so much better. I gave 4 stars just because of the toothpaste. The toothbrush \ud83e\udea5 itself is 5 stars forsure.",

It holds a charge for a long time, feels and looks like it's made of quality materials, and the best part of all is that my wife said her teeth have never felt so clean before. Skip the cheaper/lower quality electric toothbrush and go with this!",

It was not working that great anymore, not charging and I searched for the best electric toothbrush, this was #1.I decided to buy it and it was amazing to use. I find myself enjoying brushing my teeth more and I realized how terrible the other toothbrush was and this one cleans so well. It has different speed levels and the color is adorable. I bought another one for my mom because she said hers other electric toothbrush stopped working. She loves this one as much as I do and appreciates the different levels as well. They also send you 8 extra head brushes, very generous! Love this product.",

My wife has had the same brush for 4 years, still working great. During that same time, I've been through two Sonicares that both failed due to power button problems.2. Compatibility. Sonicare brush heads (and generic compatibles) fit. When I finish the very generous 8 brush heads that came with it, I'm confident that I'll be able to get replacements.",
