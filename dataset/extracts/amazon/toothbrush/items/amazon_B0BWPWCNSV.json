Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to buy a bulk pack of tooth brushes and have each one individually wrapped to maximize hygiene? If you answered YES to either question, then you\u2019re going to love our Bulk Toothbrush Pack With Covers! When most people think of bulk packs of toothbrushes the idea of high quality doesn\u2019t come jumping out. They\u2019re mostly picturing cheap, flimsy toothbrushes that can only be used once. We wanted to change that. We think you can \u201chave your cake and eat it too.\u201d This 25-pack of travel toothbrushes is ultra-high-quality and affordable too. You can either use them one time and toss or long term (dentists recommend you change your toothbrush every 3-4 months). That\u2019s how durable they are. They're also perfect for donations, travel, camping, guests, gift shops, homeless shelters, care packages, dentist offices, and so much more. Every toothbrush in this set comes individually wrapped in plastic to maximize cleanliness. The plastic is very easy to open too. You won\u2019t have to rip or tear apart these wrappers. Product Features & Benefits: \u2705 25 multi-color premium toothbrushes \u2705 Professional, durable design (7 inches) \u2705 Made with medium/soft bristles \u2705 Removes stains, plaque, and tartar \u2705 Each toothbrush comes with a cover \u2705 Individually wrapped in plastic for hygiene",
