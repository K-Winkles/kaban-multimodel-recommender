                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve never heard of a charcoal infused toothbrush before, so I was kinda confused when I went scouting out some new toothbrushes for me and my girlfriend earlier this week, this one was sponsored and had decent reviews so I figured why not, to be honest the only thing going for it at the time for me was that the bristles were black so being a total guy in my decision making, I thought it was cool enough to buy. Upon receiving, and opening and using, this has. been the most invigorating feel of a toothbrush I have ever felt. It doesn\u2019t look like it, but you can feel how much longer the bristles are, and how much deeper of a clean it\u2019s getting near the gum line. Also, extremely soft, but not so soft to the point where you don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s cleaning, it\u2019s soft on the teeth and gums, YET somehow you can feel the scrubbing action as you brush and how good it is at reaching certain points between the teeth. Also the toothbrush is slim and sleek in design, comfortably maneuvers around the mouth. I LOVE this brush. will buy again.",

I literally have to manually remove gunks near the gums because my electrical toothbrush caused too much pain. Of course, this result in some gum recession! :(Other regular manual toothbrushes I have tried weren\u2019t really that much better until I ran across this and decided to give it a try. I just had my first brush and it was like a little massage to the gums! My teeth hasn\u2019t felt this clean after a brush for a long time! I\u2019m so happy!!!",

I had to google how to contact Amazon, then use the chat to get a replacement. The only relevant option there was items not received at all, & the chat has response selections instead of talking to someone. I have prime solely for shipping, and can't really send back items I need now just because half of them are missing. Reading other reviews this seems to be a prevalent issue with this specific item.",

                "reviewText": "I bought 4 of these toothbrushes to go with the charcoal Colgate toothpaste. The head is very slim and small which feel child like. The brush is way too soft to do any tooth scrubbing. It feels more like a water color paintbrush. The only advantage is that you can reach deeper teeth easier. I would only recommend this is you have extreme sensitivity or using dentures.",
