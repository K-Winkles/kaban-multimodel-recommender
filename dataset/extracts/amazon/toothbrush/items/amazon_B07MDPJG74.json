                "reviewText": "Nothing like the dentist whitening your teeth - but OMG much better and easier than whitening strips/gel\u2026I\u2019ve consistently had quick and obvious results with one vigorous use (every so often) of these charcoal toothbrushes (my method \u2014 may not be necessary to be as enthusiastically vigorous). : )I am addicted to my electric tooth brush/water pick combo. So I don\u2019t use a manual brush very often.I first bought these charcoal toothbrushes because I forgot to pack my electric toothbrush. I loved the results immediately.So now (just when I think about it) I use the charcoal brushes via a good old manual scrub (two minutes just like the electric) and voila! I am always amazed how much brighter my teeth are.I guess the electric toothbrush is for lazier people who want to mindlessly go the two minutes recommended - and have other benefits that a manual brush do not?As good as these charcoal toothbrushes work for whitening I\u2019m beginning to wonder if electric is better!Did I say that I am addicted to my electric (massage and oh so clean with the attached water pick - if I have to put the brush down to use a separate water pick - I just won\u2019t floss - wow I really am lazy!)I\u2019ve used a wide variety of other \u201ccharcoal based\u201d fad products (Sun screen, deodorant, lotions, scrubs). This is the ONLY charcoal based product that I actually notice the difference over cheaper old-school options.",

                "reviewText": "I can't use whitening toothpaste, so I was really happy to see this product! I am even happier that my dentist is thrilled with how it removes plaque and build up on my teeth. I am a coffee drinker, so my teeth didn't whiten a lot, but they do somewhat with this brush. My cleanings, however, have been a breeze, and I get compliments on how well I am doing cleaning my teeth.",
