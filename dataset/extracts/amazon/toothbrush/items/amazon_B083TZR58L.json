                "reviewText": "I usually just buy a multi package of toothbrushes that are on sale, cheapest, whatever. I like soft bristles-dentist recommended to me long ago, and well, overall they're really the same as far as I'm concerned. So these were on sale when I bought them, I think around 7.99. So price-wise they were right around what I'd normally pay for toothbrushes, just a tad higher.The bristles are soft. The downside for me, the strip of bristles is narrower in the width than a regular toothbrush. It's like they're missing a row or two of bristles on the sides. On the one hand, this makes it easier to brush on an angle along my gum line. But more difficult when cleaning my gums and tongue.The wooden handle is also a different feel if you're used to the plastic ones. Just ever slightly heavier, I don't know how to explain it, but it's a different feel. Not bad, just different. Initially I did kind of jab my teeth with the top wooden part, I think that was more related to the narrower bristles.Overall I'd put these around a 3 1/2-4 stars, with the lower stars simply for the narrow strip of bristles. They do work, and are ok. They're just different than what I'm used to and I can adapt to them. I'll continue to use them.",

                "reviewText": "These bamboo brushes are pretty similar to the similar plastic-handled toothbrushes I have been using. (Two different brands in photo) And at about $1 a piece they cost 5 times less than the plastic ones.The bristles seem just as soft, the heads have almost as many clusters of bristles as the plastic ones, but there may be fewer bristles per cluster, so it's not as robust a brushing feeling. The bristles are not as close to the edge as one of the brands (which I prefer), and the bamboo ones lack the bristle cluster at the tip of the brush, so like another reviewer, the tip of the handle above the bristles tends to poke my gum or cheek. The bamboo handle is flat, not like the thicker and contoured plastic handles, so that may take a bit to get used to.However, the fact that I will not add any more \"forever\" plastic handles to the earth far outweighs these minor differences.",

                "reviewText": "Some people review certain things right away, this time I waited a while to give it a good chance. These arrived April 23rd 2021 and I used the purple one straight away every day until August 26th 2021. The blue one is brand new and shall be my next victim, just to show the comparison of being used vs new. Every use left my teeth feeling super clean even the last one and I use a good natural tooth powder. Anyway for those who say the bristles are too soft, I don't want to know what you use (a wire brush?). The bristles on these are perfectly soft, yet they have a durability that I have never found in any other toothbrush. (Not for those people who smash and brush so hard the tooth brush looks like it got ran over or chewed on by a rabid raccoon) If you like your gums to bleed then this probably isn't what you want. They are like a mattress that gives perfectly yet is firm underneath to endure use and yet be very comfortable. This toothbrush never turned black as you can see. I turned it bristles down across a cup to dry every time like you're supposed to with bamboo brushes. The edges are smooth so no splinters. The price for ten brushes makes me feel very happy too as I will not have to buy brushes again for a long time. Yes I do know you're supposed to change your brushes every three months or sooner (who doesn't?). Also did you know bamboo doesn't have the same issues with bacteria as it's plastic counter parts? Anyway I chose to use it for that long just to see if it would hold up that long and it did for a month longer than a plastic one. I was changing my plastic ones every two months, and that haunted me because of what it does to the environment. I have no use of the A and B stamped on them as I am the only one in my bathroom and wouldn't get it confused, but that is a nice feature for multiple brush households. I highly recommend these tooth brushes!! Great price, great bristle softness, so many colors!! And best of all you're not choking the land fills and oceans with plastic brushes.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this product bc it was advertised as being 100% biodegradable with soft \"BPA free bamboo charcoal bristles\". The actual packaging though clearly states that the bristles are nylon. So, which is it? Outside bristles are light tan in color. Inside bristles are charcoal color. Taken directly out of the box and used, I found the bristles to be more medium firm. After soaking the toothbrush in water for a minute or 2 the bristles seemed to soften somewhat. It's a nice toothbrush and the packaging is top rate but either Amazon's product discription or the package discription is inaccurate. If I knew this product was 100% biodegradable I'd have given it a 4 rating.",
