                "reviewText": "This sonic toothbrush is really nice so far. It had very good reviews, and the price was right, so I ordered it. I topped off the charge on the first day, and I have used it daily for a few weeks, and it is still going strong. There are five intensity settings. When on, it runs for 30 seconds, pauses for a second so you know to move to the next quadrant, and repeats to cover all 4 quadrants of teeth. I use a small amount of toothpaste, add a little bit of water, and turn it on. I rinse the entire handle after each use, and it must be water-tight because it keeps working great! I would not recommend immersing it, but it doesn't seem to be a problem for the handle to get wet. It came with extra toothbrush heads. Replacements can also be ordered. When the blue bristles fade, it is time to pop on a new head. My teeth feel much cleaner after using this than they do with a regular tooth brush.It is a very pretty ice blue, and is weighted so it stands up on my vanity and doesn't topple over.",

The charge really holds for approximately a month and my only issue is the on button though conveniently located, allows it to turn on if bumped in your toiletry bag so I don't usually travel with it but I do love this toothbrush!",

                "reviewText": "When I first purchased this toothbrush I really liked the shape and color of it. Is not as strong as other electric brushes, but it does the work better than manual. After a year of use, it stopped working after a year of using it every day. I searched for other electric toothbrushes on Amazon. I decided to purchase the same one again, only because I still had some extra packages of the replacement toothbrush, and for the price I figured that if it stops working after a year at least I used the replacements and didn\u2019t spend more than 25$ on it.",

                "reviewText": "This was a replacement for 2 successive Oral-B/Braun toothbrushes I've used for over 2 decades.Pros:-- Much better job of cleaning teeth than my rotary brush Brauns-- Super-long battery life before having to charge (used over 3 months, still haven't had to charge it!!!). This is convenient for trips longer than 2 weeks, as I don't have to bring a charger-- Relatively inexpensive for mid-tier electric toothbrush (likewise with replacement heads)-- I would say the brush heads last longer than my rotary Braun brush heads. 3 months, and I haven't had to replace.-- stylish appearance, different color choices-- so far polished/smooth handle is mildew resistant (my Brauns would both develop permanent mildew stains within a year)Cons:-- There is absolutely no grip on this handle. Because it's polished/smooth handle, it gets really slippery with even a little toothpaste foam.-- If you accidentally touch the back/end of the hard part of the brush head, your tooth will get a jarring surprise from the vibration. It's like when the dentist touches your tooth with the drill the first time. It happens to me ~10 times while I brush my teeth. I open my mouth wider to minimize contact, but that only allows more foam to drip on the handle, making the handle even more slippery.-- My on/off/toggle button is super-sensitive. Once a day, I will accidentally turn off the toothbrush while brushing, or turn on the toothbrush just putting it back on the counter, or accidentally toggle to a different mode. Button location may be convenient, but mine is way too sensitive.-- It's heavy and the weight is not balanced. I'm recovering from a thumb injury, and it was really tiring (and sometimes painful) to use this toothbrush because of the weight and it being end-heavy. This probably won't affect those with healthy hand. I would have preferred they reduce the battery size and made it lighter -- 1 month battery life and I would still have been very pleased, no need for 3 month battery life.-- Timer is really really annoying. It stops the brush for ~1 second. On my sister's Philips, it simply makes a sound. I don't brush based on the timer, but tooth coverage. It's annoying to have to wait for the brush to start up again, or to have to backtrack to a tooth because the brush stopped as I was going over that tooth.Neutral:-- 5 brushing modes (I only use one, Sensitive)-- It's a lot taller than most toothbrushes. Probably the tallest I've ever seen. 10.5\" tall, which is 1.5\" taller than my Braun (see picture).But it really does do a very good job of cleaning my teeth. My only concern is that most of the toothpaste foams out because I have to open my mouth so wide. That means the fluoride has much less time on the enamel surface. Fluorine bonding to the enamel surface is an important part of brushing teeth, not just cleaning the teeth.Knowing what I know now, I really can't say if I would have bought this toothbrush in hind-sight. But it does look nice and at least my teeth \"feel\" cleaner.Update: After almost 5 months of use, it finally needed a recharge! Unfortunately, it's been so long, I forgot where I put the charger!!! I've resorted to bringing my old Braun back from the office to use at home, until I can find the charger.",

The initial charge takes less than two hours, and lasts 30 days, even a bit longer. There are several settings for the type of vibration you prefer, with each having a dedicated role to deep clean, remove plaque, or massage gums etc. There is also a timer that flicks off for a brief couple seconds when it's time to change to new quadrant of the mouth. The color is gorgeous and looks great in my bathroom, feels great in my hand as well. Highly recommend!",
