                "reviewText": "I ordered this toothbrush for my daughter, who's toothbrush kept dieing and couldn't hold a charge anymore. I would have preferred that it was one of the rechargable ones and didn't need batteries, however, I do know they make rechargable ones, they just didn't have them in the colors I needed. I love that it has a built in timer, because let's be honest, most kids don't brush the recommended two minutes all on their own. I also love it's slim design, it leaves plenty of space in the toothbrush container for their toothpaste as well. Having multiple colors to pick from is nice, so households with multiple children can get a different color for everyone so they never get mixed up. We got the the yellow and it is a really pretty shade too. Although we haven't used the travel case as of yet, it's also something nice to have and that will be put to use when we go on vacations.I would definitely recommend this product.",

Found this one which was comparable to Quip and i loved the yellow color so I grabbed it. This works like a charm! It has a timed sequence when its time to move to another section of your mouth, the batteries are easy to switch out, and the travel case is great too! I'm super pleased with this and I'm happy I made the switch!",
