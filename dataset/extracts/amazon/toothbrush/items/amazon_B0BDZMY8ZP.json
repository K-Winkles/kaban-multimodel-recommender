Not to mention, it only takes less than a minute if run it multiple times to be thorough. I'll buy more for my family.",

                "reviewText": "So, when I first heard about a toothbrush that only requires 10 seconds to brush your teeth, I was skeptical. Honestly, it sounds like one of those late night infomercials and that's the category these fall under.First, you have to gently bite up and down while moving the brush side to side to do it correctly which was a let down. It's easy enough, but I was expecting these two be like a massive sonic brush cleaning your teeth at supersonic speeds and the whole process feels like trying to rub your belly while tapping on your head.Once you turn it on, the brush vibrates and at ten second intervals it'll give you a couple short vibrations where you have to flip the brush to brush your bottom teeth.Honestly, the vibration is lackluster and it doesn't feel like it does a good job so I began using it for longer durations. At that point, I just switched back to my sonic brush.For those out there that might be negligetic their dental hygiene because sometimes we're feeling down with no motivation, then yeah.. use this because it's better than nothing. However, this isn't life changing giving me an extra two minutes each morning and night. So, I'd just save your money or buy a sonic brush which is proven to clean your teeth effectively.I'm slightly bummed I spent money on this and even got a replacement brush because I was so excited which adds to the hurt.It gets three stars because it's meh and I should've been wiser than to believe in a 10 second brush.",

                "reviewText": "Dental care isn\u2019t easy for me. As a kid my teeth were sensitive to hot and cold (Mint toothpaste too). I had stains and etching left by cement post-braces that electric toothbrushes and whitening strips couldn\u2019t fix. I couldn\u2019t afford regular dentist trips after college and was usually too tired to do more than a Closys rinse before bed. +10 years and my teeth were more sensitive to cold or very hot.Five years ago I had chipped a molar. I knew the dentist fees that would happen when I start losing my teeth. That was very real possibility since my dad had dentures by 50. I saw the CES articles about the Y brush and thought \u201cwell I have at least that much time to brush my teeth\u201d. Might as well invest as much as any of the \u2018smart\u2019 toothbrushes to get rows of teeth clean in one pass.I have had my Y Brush since February. I have a Base start and usually do two cycles on the top and bottom so I get the fronts and backs.Things I love- the Y Brush will pulse twice and blink the On light when it cycles. I won\u2019t space out to lose track of which teeth I was brushing.I am done with brushing, cleanup and mouthrinse in under three minutes.Its helped with my sensitivity and loose teeth.It is easy to care for: I take off the brush to wipe off the handle. The brush goes in a mug with some peroxide mouth rinse overnight. The flexibility of the brush plate allows a floss pick to remove large bits that don\u2019t rinse off.I replaced the brush head in August, and recharged for the first time in September.What I am a little surprised by: the replacement M size is a little bigger than the original. I don\u2019t have as much room to move it around on my bottom teeth. After a month it\u2019s loosening up enough to move it around more like the original head.Baking soda or salt toothpastes like Himalaya are too harsh to use often- it was making my teeth more sensitive again. I prefer gel toothpastes.I think I will get the paste reducer cap to make things easier on myself. It is odd that one isn\u2019t included with all base models of the Y brush to make a better user experience.Tips:Watch the videos to see how to move the Y Brush around- lightly tapping it into your teeth rather than biting it and moving from one side of the mouth to the opposite. Not all the YouTube tutorials show that and it is the most important advice to get a good cleaning (\u201cTutorial: How to brush your teeth with your Y-Brush?\u201d).Always switch to off before removing the Y Brush and turning it over to do your last half of your teeth. I think going top to bottom works to be less drippy- but drips usually will only happen if you use too much toothpaste. Around a teaspoon is plenty!",
