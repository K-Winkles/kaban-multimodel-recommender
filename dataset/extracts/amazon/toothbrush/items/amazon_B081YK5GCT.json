                "reviewText": "I ordered the 10 pack which comes with two brushes in each of 5 boxes within a bigger box. Each inner box the brisiles are a different color. These were rated medium firm. I like FIRM! I know ya'll think that is bad cuz it could damage your gums. Heard it all before but FIRM gets the plaque off and if you brush daily there is no gingervitious. (I know, my spelling sucks) Never hurt my gums. I started with the yellow brushes and what i will call mushroomed the bristiles in a week, Went to black and these were better. Got about 15 days before mushrooming. So that's 4 brushes in 44 days. I'm gonna finish the other eight but am not holding out hope for the other eight lasting the next eight weeks. I like the idea of Bamboo handles just wish they were FIRM. So going back to REACH. I know plastic, ugh!",

When I'd used them all and went to order more, they were no longer available on Amazon.I have been ordering/trying different brands for a few months now looking for medium bristly, but even though the description said medium, they were always soft or super-soft.I'd almost given up, but ordered these as a final attempt and they are exactly the right medium firmness I need. My teeth finally feel properly cleaned again.",

So I would say they are of a decent quality as I find they last how long I would expect them to. This is brushing my teeth twice a day.",
