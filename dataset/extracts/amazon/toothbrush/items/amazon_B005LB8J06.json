                "reviewText": "Backstory: Using hard or medium toothbrushes had my gums bleeding, which lead to a slight case of periodontal disease. Switched on the advice of an online article regarding toothbrushes or how to clean your teeth. Truth be told, I found No Difference in cleanliness. My teeth were cleanly smooth But my gums Weren't irritated. I even started to gently clean Around my gumline, which I didn't dare do with a harder brush, and my gums bounced back.So. Regarding The Nimbus Extra Soft Toothbrushes are heaven for my teeth and gumline. Due to my weight, I've become a mouth breather and that dries my mouth out something fierce, so the periodontal disease returned. However, my dentist was surprised that my gums hadn't receded as terribly as expected. Due, I believe, to my using my Nimbus extra soft toothbrushes to keep the plaque at bay and my gums stronger than they would have been otherwise. Fact.",
