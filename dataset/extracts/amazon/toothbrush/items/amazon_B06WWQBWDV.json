They're ergonomic and comfortable to hold, the bristles are soft and plentiful and curved in such a way that it's especially easy to brush the back teeth, and they're nice and heavy-duty to boot.They stay in good condition for longer than other (mechanical) toothbrushes, and when I switch to a new one after 3 months, I sanitize the previous one and use it around the house for deep-cleaning. Even after functioning as a very solid toothbrush for that amount of time, it's still perfect for cleaning - especially for getting into tight corners, grout lines, shower tiles etc. Then after 3 months I repeat the cycle - I start using a new one for my teeth, sanitize/recycle the previous one for cleaning tasks, and then I retire the oldest one (right into the trash can, that is). Perfect toothbrush, exceptional deep-cleaning tool, fantastic in every way. Cannot recommend these enough. I hate how much I like a specific toothbrush.",

                "reviewText": "I've tried a LOT of toothbrushes, and this one's my favorite. It has a good grip, looks great, and you can feel it working when you're brushing. The real test is popcorn. This can reach it and get it out. It is extremely effective. A trusted brand as well. I used to think it was \"Ordall-B\" because of the Brit doing the commercials. They also last long because they're so well-built. It isn't the softest, but soft enough. That's not a problem so far as I'm concerned. This is the one I'm sticking with.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this product thinking it was the Oral B Pro Health toothbrush. It looks much the same but when I compared it to the Pro Health toothbrushes that I had bought in store I realized that the head on this one is smaller. Brush may work ok, but be aware that it is not as advertised. Also, there is a label on the back of the package that indicates these toothbrushes were purchased for a dental office, so resold stock? I feel like I was deceived and will not order this again.",
