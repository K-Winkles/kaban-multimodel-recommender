I was surprised when this model toothbrush was offered at a low price, so gave it a try. I\u2019m very impressed! It\u2019s smaller than the standard size toothbrush but that does not affect functionality one bit. It vibrates at the same level as standard, has the same size head, and works just as well. It does not come with a power plug, but is provided with a USB cable that can be plugged into any USB power source. I highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "Got this to replace a different one whose bristles were way too hard. Not firm, hard.I am an electric toothbrush veteran so it's not a case of being sensitive to that sonic vibration of an electric toothbrush. I've also had all ranges of quality and price points, but after purchasing the one with the hard bristles which potentially could have flown me to the moon with all of the features, and then being outside of the return window, I did not want to spend on a super pricey one.Why the five stars? The bristles are soft as advertised versus when I searched soft bristle electric toothbrushes and it returned the one with the granite bristles lol! Ok, I should have read the details closer versus trusted the search.This toothbrush head also fits all the way to the very back teeth, top and bottom, inside and out. It has an audible timer for 30 second quadrants which is always helpful.Also, the other toothbrush had a pressure sensor which seemed like a good idea at the time, and maybe preferred by some. But the toothbrush head was so bulky that if I would get into a tight space, it would do its pause and notify thing. In the morning getting ready for work, nobody has time for all that adventure with a toothbrush lol! And was part of the reason I didn't bother to just find softer replacement heads. Truthfully, we were so far south of soft, I figured \"soft\" would still be relative.This charges with USB. I seem to have wall adapters coming out of everywhere, so I just grabbed one and it seems to work with it without overheating, no weird smells or concerns of incompatibility. I suppose I could also charge it on my laptop if I really wanted, but USB helps with portability.It is a one-speed situation, and seems to be enough. My teeth are clean when done. I've had toothbrushes with pulse, massage, interval, and honestly I personally didn't notice the difference in cleaning or comfort for all of the bells and whistles, but I'm sure those things may be important to someone.It would be nice if this didn't have an actual little charging stand, and the USB cord plugged straight into the side. But the stand is so tiny it really is taking up no space and the toothbrush holds a charge for so long you could charge it up, take it on vacation and not have to worry about taking the stand itself for in my case 3 weeks. If you are going to be gone for a month, perhaps take the little tiny stand.I have only had it for 3 weeks so haven't sorted out how accessible replacement heads are. Was kind of desperate to replace the last toothbrush so decided to cross that bridge when I got to it. But I will say the head seems to be fitting snugly, no rattling or shifting, I don't have to push it back on, All things I've experienced with other electric toothbrushes at all price points.If you would like a straightforward, rechargeable, electric toothbrush with soft bristles that fits in the nooks and crannies, is well built and low maintenance, this fits the bill!Worth a try!",

                "reviewText": "Happy with it so far. Hasn\u2019t been a week yet but so far only had to charge it that first time. Used multiple times a day.-Thinner/lighter than other versions.-Has less settings but I don\u2019t care.-Does it\u2019s job.-Would like it to have it had come with power plug adapter.-May have been willing to pay a little more if came with sanitizer or extra brush heads, but oh well.This new version I can confirm did have straight metal bar stand for the brush (which I wanted)I only purchased this because I wanted a decent sonicare that didn\u2019t cost too much after my smart bright electric toothbrush died. I had trouble deciding how to replace it, as I liked it a lot other than it was sooo difficult to remove the brush heads and that is how it broke. The smart bright brushes are great and my uv sanitizer charging stand it came with still works. I would have purchased a new brush itself if they actually sold one! Since they do not, I don\u2019t think saving money on a smile bright is worth it, if you have to buy the whole thing every year or so because it will break eventually - the brush head part is plastic. Sonicare uses metal, much easier to replace and clean daily.I attached 4 photos for anyone struggling with what to purchase and why as I found a lot of descriptions and reviews unclear.Photo 1 shows:-on bottom left, my husband\u2019s over 10 year old, Philips sonicare HX9160. Still works great. Has several settings. Is heavier and battery may not last as long as other options but it\u2019s also well used. Sanitizer that may have been purchased separately, doesn\u2019t seem to work as well as the smile bright sanitizer but still does good enough. -Above it is off brand replacement brush heads that work well for it. These do also work with this new sonicare version here because both models use the straight metal brush head holder piece.-middle is the smile bright, sanitizer charger that I kept but already got rid of the brush sorry! It does not charge or hold any other model that I\u2019m aware of but I kept it in case I got a replacement andor if I still want to use the sanitizer. Above the charger, is the off brand brush heads that will work with that model. I like these bc they have tongue cleaner on back of the heads, however difficult to keep clean and as stated, the heads are so difficult to remove by design (original and offbrand).-far right is this new sonicare HX364W3. It seems like a good deal and will last longer I\u2019m sure based on the metal vs plastic comparison for holding the brush heads.Photos 2 & 3, just thought someone may appreciate actually seeing why certain heads only work for certain brushes. The left brush head is wider and the bottom and has the tongue cleaner. It is for the smile bright. If you zoom in on the first image, the package says it works with certain brands and models but no idea if that is accurate. I just j own it does work for smile bright and not for sonicare versions I own.Photo 4 just showing the difference between an old sonicare model and this new one. These two models both have the straight metal head stand that the brushes attach too. To me, this is better. Again, both of those brush heads work for both of these sonicare models I addressed. (Be aware that a few other models I do not own have a squiggly metal bar brush stand instead and I do think these heads work with those).Hope this helps someone else confused",

                "reviewText": "I don't know what it is about this toothbrush as I had a Philips Sonicare right before this one, but my teeth felt smoother pretty much right away! The batteries seem to last a long time, I charged them before they ran out so I don't know how long they actually do last. The sleek design should be good for travel. It is too wide to fit into one of the those tubular plastic travel toothbrush holders so I just have to find something to protect it.",

The brush only comes with one brush head so will need to order more if more than one person using it. It also does not come with a case, recommend getting a case.",
