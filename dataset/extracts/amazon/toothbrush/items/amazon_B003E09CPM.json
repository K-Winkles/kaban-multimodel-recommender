                "reviewText": "Convenient battery-operated toothbrushI love having the use of an electric toothbrush without the need to charge or having to keep a charging device plugged in. Turn it on and it does a good job scrubbing my teeth while I brush.One concern is that there's no visual confirmation of battery depletion. It slows down over time so one can only guess when to replace the unit. Of course, one can estimate but having a threshold letting you know the performance has declined would be helpful. I'd also wish you had the option to offer matching or different colors so two family members don't mix up toothbrushes. These are minor issues though as it's a great alternative to going through the pain of chargers with electric toothbrushes.",
