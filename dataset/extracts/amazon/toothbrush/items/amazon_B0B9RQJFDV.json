                "reviewText": "Purchased one for myself, my wife, and my son for Christmas. I really like that they fit in the toothbrush holder and only have to be charged every so often. So far we have been using them for 5 days and they do not need a charge. The colors are little different than I expected but they are beautiful. They are really sleek looking. They have multiple settings and you just hold the power button to turn it off. It takes a little getting used to because it tickles a bit. But, it didn't take long to adjust and out teether feel so clean!!! Would highly recommend. They also come with 8 replacement heads! Excellent value for the price!",

They are soft but firm up when the brush is switched on, the 30sec quick pause to remind you to clean your mouth evenly on the timer is awesome. When it switches off I brush my tongue after, a few times over since the bristles are soft but I dont mind",

I have Invisalign braces on my teeth, so my teeth is very sensitive recently. I like this brush has Milder mode which is not there is most of the other electronic brushes. This mode doesn't hurt my tooth while brushing like the other brushes do due its vibration. The charges last for a over a week. Overall good buy.",
