                "reviewText": "Bought this as an upgrade to a Waterpik unit. My favorite thing compared to the Waterpik one is the lid. It is attached and lifts and closes easily. The Waterpik one was always falling into the water cup. I like the fact that once you turn it on, it will not spray water until you slide the button on the handle to the on position. When you return it to the base, the button automatically goes back to the off position. Water cup size is great and holds enough water to finish all mouth zones even on the highest setting. It can be charged and moved to anywhere on the counter but I have only used it plugged in. The one thing I do not like is the handle does not swivel freely on the cord like the Waterpik unit does. Overall a great water flosser!",

The secret is to use a 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water mixture 3 times a week. It works better than flossing and kills all the cavity causing bacteria. Afterwards, I run some clean water through it to flush out the mixture. I still brush,at the gum line, to toughen up the gums.",

                "reviewText": "Unfortunately, I'd already discarded the packaging! Even had an Asurian 2-year protection!But as to a REVIEW, I had been using a Waterpik Sonic Fusion. And the Sonicare wasn't as convenient to use for at least ONE reason: on the Waterpik Sonic Fusion, the HOSE attachment to the brush unit ROTATES, whereas the hose attachment on the Sonicare is FIXED, hence it TWISTS as you rotate the irrigation head.I was drawn TO the Sonicare because their brushes have been so good for so many years. And I thought the quad stream might be superior - I can't see that it is, however.The Sonicare IS a little quieter but not by that much. And, I've been using the Waterpik (now resurrected) has been working without problem for well over a year.However, my dentist said the Waterpik wasn't doing a good enough job by itself - and (I have cleanings QUARTERLY) he showed me the evidence. So, I had already gone back to using floss - but used the Waterpik before and after flossing - THEN I used my Sonicare toothbrush (which I consider superior to all other electrics - especially with its available brush heads - I use the A3).I guess I'll write off the cost of the Sonicare...(It was failing to draw any water - no matter how I set any of the switches - the MOTOR seemed to be operating normally - possibly implying a blockage - OR a failure of the switch on the handle??)",

Water runs out fairly quickly, so I need to fill it twice to get the job done. Great product and highly recommended. Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush is great as well, and is the best electronic toothbrush period.",

                "reviewText": "Because our son had an expander installed and braces, it was very hard to clean under the expander plate/around the braces with floss or that small syringe they give you at the orthodontist. Sometimes, food would get stuck under the expander plate and just sit there to create an infection (we found out the hard way).Be bought this and a world of difference. It was able to take out popcorn kernels to vegetables stuck between the plate and the roof of his mouth.I set it at 5 or less so it doesn't cause his gums to bleed or be in pain. 10 is pretty strong. I'd recommend starting at a low setting and going up depending on what is needed and how much food is still there.You need to drain the water out of the tank after every use and leave the lid open to dry out. We removed the cleaning pique from the machine to let it dry on its own as well.We stopped using it now that the expander or braces are gone, but it certainly will be used again for Stage 2.",

                "reviewText": "I have been waiting to write this review but first I wanted time to experience the flosser with it's various features and nozzles. Now that THAT has happened, here is my review. I should tell you that I have used a WaterPik flosser for many years. I always thought that WaterPik had the edge over water flossers UNTIL I tried this Philips water flosser.I got to tell you that I can't say enough good things about this 7000 model. The first and most important to me was the quietness of the water pump. I now can floss late at night without waking up the house. This model has all the bells and whistles: 4 modes, 3 nozzles, 10 intensity settings, a 30-second pacer (if desired) that indicates when you should move to the next quadrant of your mouth, Pulse-Wave Technology for two of the modes, Magnetic Docking for the handle when not in use, a 600 ml reservoir with a hinged lid, control of the water flow on the handle.The first three modes: CLEAN, DEEP CLEAN and SENSITIVE are used to remove food particles from around your teeth. The fourth mode, MASSAGE is to use water in a gentle flow to massage your gums. All the modes are wonderful so it is really a matter of personal choice as to what you prefer at any given session. The nozzles: the Standard nozzle ejects water like any water flosser, the Comfort nozzle is quite unique in the sense that it can touch your tooth and not slide off, as the rubber end acts like a brake for an exacting wash, the Quad Stream nozzle works similarly to the Comfort nozzle because it has a rubber tip as well but the squirting pattern is in four directions at once. I am NOT convinced that the Quad Stream nozzle is BETTER than the other nozzles, just different.I should also note the three nozzles come in a very practical plastic case with the intent to store them in the case between flossings.The Pacer, which essentially is a timer that indicates that your 30 seconds are up and time to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth. The indication is in the form of a 1-2 second pause of the water pump as opposed to an audio beep. Personally, I turned the pacing feature off.Having a hinged lid on the reservoir ..... I really hadn't thought about it before as the WaterPik units have a detached lid or cover. But I actually close the lid when I am flossing now because I believe it keeps the water at a stable temperature without cooling.And finally, the Magnetic Docking of the handle is a really cool and simple feature. Click and it is attached to the unit.In some of the other reviews I have read, people have mentioned water leaks. I have not experienced unintended water leaks from the handle, the hose or the reservoir. Mind you, I use ALL 600 ml of water each flossing and wipe everything dry until the next time as opposed to some who leave a supply of water in the reservoir so they don't have to keep filling it. Whether that contributes to leaks, I have no idea.When you are done flossing, detach the nozzle, blow out any drops of moisture and store it in the case. Shake out the handle in the sink ....a couple of drops of water may come out ....wipe the handle and the reservoir dry until next use.Anyways, as you can conclude, I am TOTALLY happy with my purchase. It truly DOES blow WaterPik away and the manufacturer has a two-year warranty.",
