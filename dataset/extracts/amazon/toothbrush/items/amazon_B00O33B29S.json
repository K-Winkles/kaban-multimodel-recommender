                "reviewText": "This is by far the softest toothbrush I have bought. I even bought the regular soft tooth brush in this brand, and it was too hard for my sensitive teeth and gums. Because I did not find the Colgate soft to be all that soft, I was reluctant to try this one. The extra soft is significantly softer than the soft. It did not cause any extra irritation to my sensitive gums and teeth. Yet, I found that it was effective at removing plaque. I mostly use an electric tooth brush, but I find that with the electric tooth brush, it is hard to get enough tooth paste on the brush because the brush head is so small. So, I started to use a regular tooth brush in addition to an electric tooth brush to ensure I am effectively cleaning my teeth. I am really impressed with this tooth brush. It has become my manual tooth brush of choice.",

                "reviewText": "These are the only toothbrush I will use. The shape and softness of the bristles help get my teeth clean with ease. The handle is ergonomic too. The pastel colors it comes in is cute but I wish it came in more muted colors like black and white, since I love minimalism. Overall, these are a great choice and a lifetime staple item.",
