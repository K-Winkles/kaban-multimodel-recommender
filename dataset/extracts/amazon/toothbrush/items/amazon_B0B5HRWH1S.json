There is feedback about the pressure you\u2019re using on your teeth on a small ring around the handle for the amount of pressure you are applying and it vibrates every thirty seconds so you know it\u2019s time to move on to the next quadrant in your mouth. The brush itself works amazingly well. My teeth feel as clean after every brushing as they do after leaving the dentist\u2019s office. Highly recommend, especially if you can get on sale although it\u2019s worth the full price.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been a Phillips Sonicare user for close to a decade. I switched from a regular toothbrush and never looked back. But I always felt I was missing out on getting truly clean. Oral B was always on my mind but never what I bought. It took two things for me to switch, Phillips\u2019s bad customer service and my dentist mentioning my back molars are hard to reach because they grew out wrong. They suggested Oral B because it would be able to reach where the larger Sonicare heads couldn\u2019t. So when my handle battery started giving out I knew it was time to switch. The switch was WORTH IT. It\u2019s my perfect brush. The oscillating is so much better than the vibrating. The handle is large and comfortable. The heads are quite nice and do an excellent job at cleaning at any setting. The charger is nice and the case being included for travel, nice touch. I\u2019m mostly impressed with the singular smart feature, a pressure sensor that lights green, white and red. I do not want my toothbrush to be dependent on Bluetooth or WiFi. I don\u2019t want an app, but this, this is perfect! It\u2019s just a visual cue on whether or not you\u2019re brushing hard enough or too hard. That really sold me. Bear in mind, you do need to take some care to get the longest life out of these German made beauties. Mostly just rinse the head and handle after every brushing. That\u2019s why the head removes so easily, it\u2019s detailed in the manual. Follow that, and you\u2019ll avoid the nasty buildup that can happen with these style brushes. If you\u2019re on the fence, give it a shot. It\u2019s been a game changer for me.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this toothbrush because I didn't think conventional brushing was doing the job well enough. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it does in removing plaque at the gum line. I charged it when it came as directed. The battery lasted a week with twice daily brushing and charged nicely overnight. Many of the features are great! The green light tells when the pressure is correct and the red light tells you if you brush too hard. The prompt tells you when to switch quarters (30 seconds), this is very nice. Dancing lights tell you if you have brushed for two minutes. Great if you have kids. I do find that I can't tell what cycle the brush is in, so I don't know if I'm in the cleaning, whitening or the other mode. There are two types of brushes that came with this model but I don't know the difference between them or what they are for. The print in the owner's manual is so small, you need a powerful magnifying glass to read them. I would give five stars if the issues I mentioned were addressed.",
