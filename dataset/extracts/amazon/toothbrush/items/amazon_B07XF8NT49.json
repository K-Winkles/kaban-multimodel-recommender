                "reviewText": "I have several powered electric tooth brushes. I mostly use the high frequency variety but the dentist said I was missing some spots to the far back of my mouth and on my gum line. This tooth brush works like a hand operated tooth brush in that the bristles are turned to clean the teeth. The bristles are somewhat stiff which I like and you can really get the gum line. In addition, the physical design of the tooth brush allows you to reach way back in your mouth with ease. I still use the high frequency tooth brush but have added this one to reach everything that I need to. Also, the battery used is the standard alkaline batteries like you would use in your flash light. They last a long, long time and are no issue compared to a rechargeable battery toothbrush. I kind of like the idea of replaceable batteries. You don't have to throw the tooth brush away when the rechargeable batteries wear out.",
