I previously used an electric toothbrush for years replacing the head everyday 3 months. My mouth and teeth just didn\u2019t feel as clean as this toothbrush. My dental hygienist uses this same toothbrush brush. She said it cleans plaque 80% more and whitens teeth 50% more! The more plaque a toothbrush removes means whiter teeth. Don\u2019t forget to brush your gums and inside your mouth to reduce germs and disease!! I highly recommend this toothbrush! I also use the Colgate Optic White Renewal 10X toothpaste.",

When I'm brushing, the brush head will sometimes come out of the body and I'll end up stabbing myself with the tip of the body. I've found the only solution to this is to hold onto the brush head itself while brushing. Other than thst everything about the toothbrush works fine, it's very simple and easy to use with only one button. They even provided me with batteries.",
