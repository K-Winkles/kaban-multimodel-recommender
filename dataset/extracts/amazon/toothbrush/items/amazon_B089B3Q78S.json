                "reviewText": "I have a 10 year old, 8 year old, and 4 year old that use these. They are perfect for all of them cause they fit in their hands perfectly. Not too big or too small. The bristles are soft but not too soft to where you have to worry about it not brushing and not too hard to where it\u2019s uncomfortable. It\u2019s the perfect softness. The colors are bright and really pretty and the wood of the brushes is stable! I love how they come with so many cause we always have extras on hand for when they get sick and we have to replace their toothbrushes. My kids were super excited to pick out their colors also! Highly recommend",

The perfect everyday kids\u2019 toothbrush-and we\u2019ve tried most brands both standard and electric! It leaves teeth clean but is gentle on gums. The bristles are also very flexible so it really looks like it gets between teeth better than other toothbrushes.",

The bristles are holding up well after a few weeks of use. The only minor issue is that leftover toothpaste tends to get stuck in between the bristles because it sticks to the wood. Nothing a thorough rinse with warm water can\u2019t take care of.",

The one issue we had is that the round handles make it hard for our daughter to put on her toothpaste (she likes to set it down and use both hands to squeeze the tube), or to set the brush down with toothpaste on it, because it rolls over and gets on the counter. We found another brand with a flat handle that\u2019s easier to use.",

My hygienist said that I should try using a child's toothbrush when not using my electric toothbrush, because my teeth are small and so is the arched space behind my front upper and lower teeth. She gave me a free plastic child's toothbrush, which was easier to use and fit in my mouth better. But it was silly looking with cartoon characters on it and the plastic was just tacky. I bought these bamboo brushes and I am so pleased! They feel great in the mouth and in the hand. They do a great job. They are attractive!",

                "reviewText": "I love the look of these and my kids were really excited about the colors and that each box was a little surprise of what color they were going to get. A couple downsides: the toothbrush doesn\u2019t lay flat to put toothpaste on. It rolls to its side because they are round. Another downside we had happen was the backside of one of ours developed black mold. I\u2019ve never had that happen with a toothbrush before. We keep it inside our medicine cabinet on a hanging holder so I started leaving it out to \u201cdry\u201d on the counter before putting it away.",

The bristles were too harsh on my gums, leaving my gums sore for an hour every time I used it. On my third use some bristles fell out and I almost swallowed them. I would say for someone without sensitive gums it might be an option, but if you also have dental concerns in addition to environment friendly aspirations then I would keep looking.",
