                "reviewText": "I couldn't be more happier. Previously, I was using Goodmouth Baracuda toothbrushes. I like them for three reasons - compact head, short in length, and soft bristles. But Goodmouth went out of business, and I had extreme difficulty finding a similar toothbrush. At first, I gave up and just settled for some adult sized Oral-B toothbrushes. Huge mistake. Instant gag reflex. The bristle head was 1.25\", the head was super bulky and wide, and the toothbrush length was 7.75\". I didn't even finish bushing the first time before I tossed them in the trash. The Goodmouth Baracudas had a 7/8\" bristle head, the head was skinny, and it was 6.75\" in length. I read that the Xlent Toothbrushes had a head that was between 0.95\" to 1\". And one person said that it was 7.5\" in length and another one said around 8\". The toothbrush length had me worried. Also, Xlent emailed me and I think that they said the head was 1.1\". So I was starting to think that the handle was too long and the head might not be as compact as I wanted it to be. I was wrong. What a pleasant surprise. The bristle head is 7/8\", just like the Goodmouth Baracuda toothbrushes. Same skinniness too, which is great. Actually, slightly skinnier because of the shape. And the overall length is around 7 3/8\". I found that I really like the toothbrush handle. It feels great in my hand because of the cushion grips and ergonomic shape. Not only that, but the bristles are truly soft and a joy to brush with. The Goodmouth Barrucada toothbrushes were supposed to be soft bristle and they certainly felt soft when I first bought them, but the latest toothbrush that I used was fresh out of the wrapper and felt hard maybe from old age. Anyway, my rating is 10/10. I am definitely going to be buying these Xlent toothbrushes for the rest of my life. I hope that they don't make any drastic changes to them, like make the heads bigger or the handles longer or anything stupid like that. They are attractive toothbrushes so I like looking at them too. I get OCD about stuff that looks ugly. Thanks Xlent. Good job!!!",

My mouth feels clean and my teeth feel 'polished', which I love.Unlike some other (more expensive) 'soft' bristles, the bristles do NOT fall out in my mouth.Will keep ordering these.",

                "reviewText": "The bristles are flexible which is what constitutes as soft. They are firm, but flexible. The two improvements I would like to see are that they include 2 times the bristles these have. They are spaced far apart, so a thorough cleaning will take a little longer. The other is that the head could be smaller. It's getting harder to find compact heads without downgrading to a child's toothbrush, but there are many like me that need a smaller head to reach around all teeth, including the back. These are still close to the Nimbus, but I still have to say the Nimbus is somewhat superior but even Nimbus has problems understanding what compact actually means.",

                "reviewText": "After trying out almost every tooth brush at my local Walgreens, Walmart, Publix, CVS, etc you name it I tried it, all of the tooth brushes labeled \"soft\" ended up in my trash can. I have super sensitive gums and teeth, and when I go to the dentist my doctor has been saying that my gums are receding more and more every time I go for my check up. Since I buy everything else I own off of Amazon, I decided to search for a \"soft\" toothbrush when I came across these. I ordered the four pack and received them super fast and they came in blue, purple, green and pink. Before brushing I always soak my tooth brush head in warm/hot water to soften the bristles and did so with this brush as well. The first time I used these I was AMAZED at how SOFT they were. I can honestly say it is the softest tooth brush I have EVER used. I can feel the bristles actually going between my teeth for a deep cleaning and not ripping apart my gums like all the other brushes I have tried. After I was done brushing my mouth felt so refreshed, clean, and feeling great. The black bristles also add a very cool touch to the appearance of the brush making it that much cooler! I gave the other 3 brushes to my mother, father, and girlfriend and they were also blown away at how soft these brushes were and what a great job they did.",
