I'm not a smoker however and my oral hygiene is pretty good but I always felt the mediums were a bit soft. Sometimes I ended up breaking the brush in half at the handle while brushing because I was trying to grind it on my teeth. So I purchased these to get more durability out of them but they are far too hard. I thought maybe I'd need to \"wear\" them in but the bristles gave in very little. Save your money and purchase a steel brush so you can use it for the underside of your vehicle as well. I gave it a 3/5 because it works as intended but just not for me.",
