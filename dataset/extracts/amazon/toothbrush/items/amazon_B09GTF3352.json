My partner likes this thicker handle and replaceable head, while I like the board bristle brush's narrower handle and stiffer, wider bristles.

                "reviewText": "I wanted to find a natural alternative to plastic toothbrushes and came across this one. I have been using Preserve toothbrushes for 15 years, so this is my bar to match. I noticed immediately that there are only a few rows of bristles making the brush very narrow, like a child's toothbrush. Sometimes the brush feels like it's not doing a good job cleaning because there just aren't enough bristles to get into all the crevices. Second, the wooden head of the toothbrush feels wide and is angled in a very strange way. Its positioning in your mouth feels odd, like maybe it is designed for someone with a big mouth, but the brush is so small that it's only suitable for a child. I've used it for a while already, so can't return it. But I'm probably going to throw it out and go back to the Preserve.UPDATE: Better & Better has wonderful customer service. The current version of the toothbrush is uncomfortable for me and does not fit my mouth shape. They offered a refund after reading my review. Giving them another starfor excellent customer service. Whenever they update the toothbrush design I will give it another try!",

                "reviewText": "After my dentist told me I have receding gums and I needed to use a toothbrush with softer bristles, I went on a hunt. I'm so glad I found this toothbrush - the bristles feel GREAT, like a gentle gum massage. I'm always looking for little ways to reduce my plastic waste, so love that it's A. plastic free. and B. has a replaceable head, so I can keep the handle instead of chucking it every three months. Bonus - it looks so nice in my bathroom!",
