                "reviewText": "The slim, stylish case makes this toothbrush great for college - you don't have to remove the head to store it! Great features that elevate it above a standard toothbrush - the head doesn't spin or anything, but the 2-minute timer is great and has helpful 30-second intervals. I really like that there are two modes (whitening and cleaning - you can use one or both at once), even though I can't really tell the difference between the two. Overall, the toothbrush provides a gentle but deep clean - I feel very refreshed afterward. The purple color is GORGEOUS and looks exactly the same as in the photos, which is why I was drawn to this toothbrush in the first place. I was a little worried because of all the incentivized reviews, but this toothbrush really is awesome so far!",

I saw this one and I liked the colors, the size and decided to give it a try. Wow! I am loving it since the first day and bought two more for my daughters. It is rechargeable and the battery lasts more than a month, it fits perfectly in my cosmetic bag when I travel, the colors are fun and modern and it only takes the minimal space in my medicine cabinet. I highly recommend this product! I forgot to mention, it has two speeds! Great work and design! Thank you!",

The bristles are tough so if you want something less harsh, it might make sense to try a different toothbrush. It works well for me though. Super intense vibration level too. Lasts a long time without charging with wall charger. I like how small it is for my somewhat small hands. Really like the travel case too.",
