                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying I've been a Quip fan boy since the beginning. I've bought them for my entire family of five and have tried the limited metal colors, mouth wash, dental floss. Not all of the solutions have been good or better than what you can buy or get free from your dentist. But none of them have ever been defective or poorly designed. This rechargeable version cost more and fails on delivering on the design. One lasted almost 31 days before failing to hold a charge, and the second one lasted even shorter. Only 2 recharge cycles and dead. Just dead. Light says charging, but the toothbrush is just a normal non vibrating brush. Statistically getting two bad ones is crazy to think about with the thousands they must be selling, but I'm sure I'm not alone. STAY AWAY FROM THE RECHARGEABLE version. There is something wrong with it and I've now wasted time and money. Go with the tried and true battery one.",

I reported it to Amazon as there is a 3 month warranty and they said to contact Quip through the messaging portal. I contacted Quip and they said they couldn\u2019t help me even though it\u2019s within warranty. Based on reading other reviews here, it looks like this company is a scam and they know this product won\u2019t last but won\u2019t even honor the warranty. Save yourself your money and buy a Sustainable Tomorrow electric toothbrush instead.",

                "reviewText": "So, there\u2019s a few reviews on here stating that their rechargeable Quip toothbrush was not holding a charge or stopped working. Perhaps there were some duds in the factory or something, there\u2019s no way to be sure. However, with my experience I have had zero problems with this toothbrush. As soon as I got it I plugged in the charger and let it charge for awhile until it was time to brush that night. Since then, I\u2019ve only had to charge it one other time. I have previously used a quip toothbrush and while I liked it, I found that changing the battery every so often became a bit annoying and I also think over time it wore down the handle since you had to disassemble it every time you did so. This toothbrush eliminates that hassle and I love that, otherwise it\u2019s just another regular Quip toothbrush.So why only four stars if no problems?Here\u2019s the thing, if you go into this a get this toothbrush having previously used a Quip brush (and liked it), you\u2019ll be fairly happy with the results. Like I said, recharging is always better than having to use disposable batteries. But there\u2019s a few notes I\u2019d like to point out.The charger itself is magnetic and has a light on it that illuminates to let you know when the brush is connected and charging. However, mine will go out after just a minute or two even though the unit is still charging. That can be a bit misleading. So maybe the magnetic contact isn\u2019t the greatest?The biggest thing to realize is if you\u2019re shopping for an \u201celectric toothbrush\u201d then look elsewhere. Quip IS NOT an electric toothbrush. I say that because this toothbrush does not move bristles or clean etc any more than a regular brush would. That\u2019s something people that have never used Quip before should take note of. This toothbrush is essentially, a glorified timer that times your brushing with vibrations in the handle. That\u2019s it. So, you\u2019re really paying a more premium price for a toothbrush that vibrates for two minutes. It won\u2019t clean your teeth any better or worse than a regular old toothbrush will, it\u2019s more of a psychological thing to get you in the habit of brushing your teeth more regularly and with better brushing habits. Therefore, it\u2019s only 4 stars, because it\u2019s not for everyone and it\u2019s a bit of a premium price to pay for toothbrush with a timer. That\u2019s just my two cents.",

It's also a really familiar brush shape and size, coming from using a manual toothbrush it feels like I'm getting a boost without spraying toothpaste everywhere like other electric brushes I've tried. I also travel quite a bit and love that I can just roll the mirror mount off and transform it into a travel cover!",
