                "reviewText": "Comparing these to a really good paintbrush may seem weird, but that was what came to mind. I don't like many of the toothbrushes available in the local stores. I think they are trying too hard with complicated designs and they never seem soft or gentle enough. So I found these. The bristles are soft. It felt very comfortable to brush. The bristles felt springy. While they are soft, they hold their shape well, just like a really good fine art paintbrush. I set a reminder on my calendar to swap out at 3 months, and I felt the brush was still good - not worn out. The charcoal though had started to fade, as I expected it would. Overall, this is a really nice toothbrush.",

                "reviewText": "I am very happy with my purchase. The toothbrush are just soft enough if you have receding and sensitive gums. this is what my dentist suggested I should use. Very soft toothbrush are very hard to find in regular stores or drugstores. they normally go by the category \"ultra soft\".The last one I got in a regular store was made by one of the big names (C........gate). These were the most uncomfortable toothbrush I have use to date. The handle kept on rotating in my hand and I couldn't get a good hold on the darn thing. You will think, these big name have been making toothbrushes for many decades, they should get it down path by now. But NO it was very unwieldy.The handle of these toothbrushes are very comfortable in your hand and are very easy to use. I will buy them again.",

                "reviewText": "As I make my own activated charcoal toothpaste, it's important to have black bristles for my appeal.These are awesome, wouldn't say they are soft, more like medium soft.I like the size of head as it's small enough to reach those tough spots but still usable for adults & kids.My ONLY con to this brush set is all of them look the same, and this makes it a bit challenging when more than one family member wants to use them. A slight change in color set / style design would be really nice but nonetheless I love this brush set and will definitely buy again.",
