                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The best overall Sonicare toothbrush",
                "reviewText": "This is the best electric toothbrush within the Sonicare range of power brushes.It offers a great balance of features and performance for the price and is a great buy.The water resistant handle is slim, light and feels quite grippy despite the lack of textured surfaces on the handle.2 intensity settings are available. This gives you a high and low option depending how powerful you want the cleaning to be.The 4100 offers 31,000 bristle movements per minute which is less than its predecessor at 62,000. But the motor has been configured that despite offering half the bristle movements, the cleaning sensation and results are comparable. I struggle to tell the difference. The clean is invigorating and my teeth felt great after each use.The BrushSync technology that tracks the brush head and activates the light on the handle is clever. It does mean the brush heads are a bit more expensive. You don't need this feature, but it is handy if your are not very good at remembering to replace the heads regularly.There is a 2 minute timer, pacer and pressure sensor, all work well. The vibration of the pressure sensor in the handle is really obvious, so you can take corrective action quickly.The battery life is said to be 2 weeks, I achieved a little over that at 17 days on the high intensity setting.There is a new charging stand included. It has a USB connector at the end of the cable rather than a 2 pin power adapter. It is potentially more convenient for some but if you do want to charge from a wall socket, you need to source your own USB to 2 pin adapter.Pros+ 2 intensity settings \u2013 choose between low and high power+ The timer and pacer encourage brushing for the recommended time+ Slim handle design \u2013 stylish & easy to keep clean+ USB charging stand makes it more convenient for some+ BrushSync technology \u2013 reminder when brush heads need replacingCons- Fewer bristle movements than most other Sonicare brushes- The pressure sensor isn\u2019t visible \u2013 vibrates the handle instead- No indicator lights to show which intensity is selected- USB charger makes it less convenient for some- Battery life isn\u2019t as good as some other Sonicare brushes",

                "reviewText": "The first ten days of using this toothbrush handset I hated it. I charged it for 4 hours and started using it. It was weak and the battery didn\u2019t seem to hold charge. I almost sent it back.Then I RTFM (read the instruction manual). First, you need to charge a full 24 hours the first time. Second, there is a \u201c get acquainted mode\u201d that is automatically employed in the first several uses that significantly limits the speed. This mode is automatically turned off after several uses but can be turned off manually. Third, there are two speeds, \u201cBarely adequate \u201c and \u201cDecently strong\u201c. First press starts at barely adequate, then second press changes to \u201cthat\u2019s what I wanted\u201d.I am now quite happy with this handset. And the battery life is quite good, adequate for weekend travel without the charger adapter (USB-A adapter provided, BYO charger).",
