I had a recent dentist appointment and my dentist told me that I needed a deep clean because of my gum line. It\u2019s a simple process but the dentist has to numb the mouth with gel and they section off the mouth, not done all at once, so kind of a big deal. Anyway, after using this toothbrush for a couple of months, my dentist was surprised when I returned and my gums and teeth weren\u2019t as bad as before! She even asked if I had switched to an electric brush! This toothbrush is amazing and made a huge difference in my cleaning experience! I have purchased 2 more times since the beauty store and I have gotten a few friends hooked as well! The bristles are very soft and I can get the brush into the smaller spaces in my mouth. It has literally been a game changer! One of my friends described it as \u201ca hug\u201d for her teeth! Its the best toothbrush!",

Talk about cleaning teeth, gumline, gums, tongue buildup....all brushed & cleaned with super gentle effectiveness. Amazing.!!! I'm so happy with this. I bought another brand a few years ago and I loved it until now. This becomes #1. I gave one to my daughter and she loves it too. Just wow!!Update after a few days' use:. Notice the middle section the yellow part is a bit firmer than the rest mainly to brush the top of your teeth which is quite useful but be mindful of it because if you brush too zealously, which I did, made my gum hurt.",

I know it sounds weird to use the word luxurious with a toothbrush, however I must say it was so soft on my gums and with 12,000 ultra fine bristles it really does a great job cleaning. My teeth feel like I was at the dentist after brushing, so clean and shiny. I will never go back to a regular toothbrush again. I bought 8 more toothbrushes from Amazon because I loved it so much. I plan to give out as a little extra to my friends and family. You will not be disappointed.",
