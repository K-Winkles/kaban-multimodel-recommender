I whiten my teeth so I didn\u2019t buy the brush for that, but it\u2019s an extra bonus. The way the brush is designed it feels like a massage on my gums.",

I have used Oral B products for years, mainly the cross action brushes which are also great. I'm creature of habit but wanted to try these because they were intriguing. I don't know about getting your teeth whiter, but I also use whitening toothpaste and together my teeth look very white. In addition, they clean your teeth very well. Nice balance on the handle and the brush design is good. Some reviews say they are large or the bristles are \"not soft\" and for some folks they may be because everyone is different. For me they are just right. I do think for the money they are worth a try at least. Just go for it.",
