                "reviewText": "Just purchased another as we moved and I now use our second bathroom just as often as the master bathroom.The whole mixed color grab bag approach is a little less than deseriable. I managed to randomly get the absolutely last color I would've ever picked. Aside than black which I don't think they make it in.I saw some reviews stating how disgusting the top got when they took the head off to change it. Absolutely just like anything else you put in your mouth that'll happen if you don't clean it. Not really any different than a mouth guard or dentures that you use over and over in your mouth.Even silverware. Honestly it's more like silverware than we think. My dentist compared electric toothbrushes to silverware. Essentially everything that touches your any piece of silverware you use in a day touches your toothbrush. Treat your toothbrush half as good as your silverware. Don't leave it exposed on the bathroom counter for the toilet water particles to drop into, you wouldn't dip your fork in the toilet and then eat your salad with it. And clean your toothbrush, you wouldn't use the same fork for every meal for a month and never wash it, why would you want to do that with a toothbrush, in particular one with moving parts for all those food particles to get stuck in. Sounds gross, but it is gross, and you put it in your mouth he said.There's a reason you don't keep regular toothbrushes for years and years.Simply clean it. I clean mine everytime I clean my night guard or sports guard. I use the same tablets you can buy to soak dentures in. Two cups one for the toothbrush and one for the guard. Dizzolve tablet in warm water drop toothbrush in top down. And when I change the head. The color on the rubber part may fade, some have others have not, but my toothbrush isn't gross.The best thing about this toothbrush is that the power switch is an actual push button, not a sliding button. I can never get the sliding ones to slide without using both hands.I had a rechargable Oral-B toothbrush just like this, but after about 15 years it decided it was done charging. Finding a replacement with the dual action head was difficult. I don't mind that it's battery operated vs rechargable. The battery life is generally really good, I purchased one previously for my travel bag. However the battery that came with it is junk, it lasted about a month. Regular batteries last so long I can't even remember when I last changed it.Changing the head can be a little tricky the first time, but the directions are pretty straight forward.",
