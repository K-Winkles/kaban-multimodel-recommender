They scrub my mouth on both sides: the bristles on my teeth and the backside of the brush on my cheeks and tongue. The handle is soft and flexes a bit - that\u2019s good because I tend to apply too much pressure. I typically buy the 20-pack of whatever the big-box warehouse chain sells but I think I\u2019m going to have to change to these toothbrushes. They\u2019re that good!",
