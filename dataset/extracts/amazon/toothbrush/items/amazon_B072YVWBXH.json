again wish it had slipperly reg plastic body w/o the soft touch coating. those eventually over time will degrade n become nasty sticky icky mess but...maybe thiers will notdos. if it does then ill just use adhesive removerthe oral b had 50 percent faiure rate as i bought 2pack from costco after 1 year, one failed to chargeso time will tell if AaS is more durable and long lasting. i really hope so as it is is cuh a g8 value8 brush heads from ob? 60usd.from AqS? incld wih $40 toothbrush! that is 2 years of brush heads included!oh i guess this is a downside but also could be how this thing lasts so long on a charge - you n need to charge 24 hours to get full 100% chargebut at same weight and zie as ob, not sure what kinda battery it uses but clearly far far far far superior to oral bthanks AqS!Sorry for my typos! lolbottom line: buy this toothbrushAUg 31 2022 updateapprox usage 1-3 full cycles (2 min each cycle) dailystill havent had to charege the battery!!!!on weekends, sometimes i have used it 3x a day with 1 - 2 ful lcyclesmy oral b battery? horrible. lasts barealy a week without charging using 2x a day 1 cycle per usage. i keep it on charger most dayscomparison:AS:softer bristleslittle harder to get fully clean teet IMO as still havent gotten used to how to use it properlyamazing battery life - the review that said husband/wife use just one AS while switching brush tips, and it lasting for months, is not a lie. it is true i tell. true lol. i know cuz mine i have only done ONE 1x full 24 hour (which manual directs you to do - 24 hour for full charge). ive done that 1x back when i bought it.no weakening of power and its now aug 31th!same size as Oral B housing yet AqZSn battery is clearly much bigger and of much higher quality than Oral BPrice for Aq includes 8 brush heads!i dont know if Azmn sells AqSn brush heads but i wont have to do so for a long time. 8 w each lasting 3 months would be 2 years worth of brush heads! and the price included the toothbrush!so while i do prefer easier brushing with OB, the AS is clearly a far better value and far better battery qualityas one reviewer mentioned the AqSn brucsh head breaking, i am ultra gentle with my brushing to prevent that from occuring (i hope). tehoretically, same issue could occur with any of these electric toothbrushesCons:no power level indicator like OB has 3 leds for pwr. i wish AqS had this but as i said, im still on original charge 2 moths of usage !!! so the con is nitpicking lolstill havent really firgured out if i am brushing properly but i have same issue with a manual toothbrush lolbottom line:the AS is superior to a reg toothbrush (by how much i dont know). i use level 2 power (not the max) and it seems to work well even with my feather light brushing of teethwaterproof esseentially - iave rinsed entire housing repeatedly just like with my Oral B, neither has had issuesthe one future con i foresee:the brush head has a matte finish and all matte finshess become disgusting stickiy over time. i basiclaly will need to remove the matte finish at some point using heavy duty adhesive remover but that is oky.the oral b does not have a matte finish which is batter.Oral Bpoor battery lifeEXPENSIVE brush heads 55 for 9!expensive to replace when battery eventually dies at 50 usdfloss action - these are the specific heads i use and they work great cuz they cover whole tootheasier to use than AquaS. as i simply hold over each tooth and let OB do the workSTIFF bristiles thoughoverall OB cleans better IMOJune 26 2022only used 1x just initial impressions will update laterive used oralb 3d series from costco for 2 years using their floss action headpros of OB is effortless - all ii have to do is hold the brush feather lightly agasinst teeth vertically - not movement needed like standard toothbrushAquasonic Sonic Toothbrush has an accurate title which means it is a toothbrush with a sonic function.i have no idea if this sonic function 40k bpm actually does anything....i was hoping for a $30 oral-b replacement but instead it is a standard toothbrush with a sonic funciton meaning i stilll have to brush my teeth like a normal toothbrush.whine whine whin i konw ha ha habut i have i bone spurs in shoulders blades where upper movent causes pain hence my preference for oral b no effort tootbrushing over aquasonic.i will stil keep and use aquasonic as as a backup to my oral bwill update later once ive used long termbut again, best value for money for a toothbrush with sonic function...but again...does it actually remove plque better than standard ultra soft tootbrush???? i konw ora-b floss action head does work better but does aquasonic????time will tel.... will update later and sorry for typos",

I like them all, but this toothbrush has become my go-to. It cleans really well, the different settings are a bonus feature (although I rarely use the whitening function as I like a more gentle brushing), and it doesn't have the tendency to \"bounce\" off your teeth when you switch positions nearly as much as others. Plus, it looks great, and the included replacement brush heads are a nice bonus.Great toothbrush at a good price.",

                "reviewText": "I got my fancy new toothbrush after owning a Philips sonic for many years. I had gone to a manual brush but started to notice some buildup and things weren't looking as good as they could. I came across this on Amazon.. the price was right, the reviews were good and it looked pretty cool. So I gave it a shot. I was not disappointed! (At this point anyway)Almost right away, I noticed that it was doing a much better job of cleaning than my manual brush. It was a little unsettling at first because as the brush vibrates, it can be a little unsettling at first and feel very strange. You do get used to this!Sadly, almost 1 month later the motor started to die on me. It should be noted that my teeth have changed several shades of white during that month. I contacted customer support on December 23rd 2023 with the expectation I wouldn't hear from them until at least boxing day or farther off. Within a couple of hours I got a response asking for details and invoice information. I was pleasantly surprised! I was shocked that Christmas Eve they contacted me again to verify some details. Everything was quick and smooth and not intrusive at all. I was even more surprised they contacted me on Christmas day to let me know that a refund had been issued and that I should purchase a new one and dispose of this one with the faulty motor. I felt so bad I actually apologize to the customer service rep for having to answer and field my issue on Christmas Day. LolIt should be noted that sometimes these motors and batteries.. you just get a lemon. As long as the company is willing to stand behind their product, I would not hesitate to order another one from these guys. Does the toothbrush work as good as my Philips which cost hundreds of dollars more? Absolutely! My teeth haven't looked this good in years. It is also kind of ironic that the main issue I had with my Philips is the motor finally died in it the same way.If you're one of those people that sees this toothbrush with no moving parts and thinks it's not as effective, Google how Sonic toothbrushes work.So in summary.. the product came quickly, packaging was excellent, presentation and quality seem to be right up there even despite the faulty motor. Customer service is outstanding. Despite my Philips brush being much more expensive, they worked equally as well. I may actually like this one better.Just a tip for first time users.. do not press hard. You don't need to. You want the tips of the bristles to basically dance on the surface of your teeth. If you press, the bristles will bend and not effectively clean. It's actually the tips of the bristles bouncing off your teeth that remove the plaque and do the cleaning. Move the brush very slowly and let the bristles do all the work for you. You should be able to go from one side to the other and back within the 30 seconds before it tells you to move on to the next part of your teeth. The brush should be slightly pointed down (or up) towards your gums. This is so the tips of the bristles get underneath your gum line and poke some of that junk out of there. However, changing the angle on a regular basis also helps hit spots that you might miss on a normal pass. After doing a normal (where the brush is completely horizontal) pass on my teeth, I will sometimes turn my toothbrush totally vertical so that the brush bristles hit my teeth a different way. It does make a difference.",
