                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Sonicare clean at an affordable price",
                "reviewText": "I have the much more expensive Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean toothbrush that my entire family uses on a daily basis so I bought this one to take with me when I travel. It's basically the same toothbrush as my Diamond Clean, but without the 4 extra cleaning modes and the cool, cup charger.Sonicare toothbrushes use ultrasound waves in addition to the brushing action to more effectively break up and remove plaque and it really does work. We've been using ultrasonic toothbrushes for a number of years now and have the healthy mouths to prove it. And since there is a direct link between gum disease and heart disease, healthy teeth and gums give you more than just a beautiful smile.If you've never used a Sonicare toothbrush before, you will notice immediately that it's a very vigorous cleaning. If you have sensitive teeth, it may even be uncomfortable at first. There is an Easy Start mode that gradually increases the power of the brushing action over a two week period to help you get used to it but for some folks, it still may be too much. Philips has other Sonicare models that have a Sensitive mode that are more comfortable for sensitive teeth. This model, however, has only the one, normal mode.There is an automatic 2 minute timer to ensure you brush for the full recommended 2 minutes, which is especially great for kids. It also alerts you every 30 seconds to switch to another quadrant of your mouth so you brush every area thoroughly.This model comes with one brush head. The brush heads should be replaced every 3 months, just like a manual toothbrush. The Philips brand brush heads are excellent but also pricey. I buy these, which fit perfectly and perform just as well, IMO. Standard Replacement Brush Heads for Philips Sonicare HX6014/13 ProResults (4, 8, 12 or 20 Pack) | Fits: Easyclean, DiamondClean, HealthyWhite, Flexcare [20 Pack ]The charging base is very compact - great for limited counter space and for travel. There is a light on the toothbrush that flashes when charging and glows steady when charging is complete. When I travel, I always take my youngest son and I get about a week on a full charge with both of us using the toothbrush.I do not have sensitive teeth and I love the way it makes my teeth and gums feel. Additionally, it's fabulous for removing coffee and tea stains from your teeth. Plus, I like that one toothbrush can keep my whole family's teeth and gums healthy and all I need to do is order brush heads every few months.After purchasing the Blue/White color, I got this Guacamole color through Amazon Vine and and the Coral and Steel Blue colors as well. The Blue/White is the most neutral and should work in most any bathroom color scheme as it is primarily white. I'm using it for travel. The Guacamole is a lovely, light guacamole color that looks gorgeous in my spa themed bathroom that is green and bamboo. The Coral is a saturated, salmon pink color that would be great in a girl's bathroom. I put it in my daughter's white, gold and pink bathroom and it's definitely pretty enough to stay out on the counter. The Steel Blue is a medium blue with grayish undertones and looks great in my tiny, blue and white, beach themed bathroom. It's nice having all the colors to choose from so you can coordinate with your bathroom decor.The body of the toothbrush has a matte finish and it also has a textured area on the back so it's not slippery in wet hands. I'm also glad it doesn't have a rubberized finish because those always seem to get sticky after a year or so.If you want the Sonicare clean at an affordable price, this model is a nice choice.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars >> SUCH A DEAL!!!",
                "reviewText": "BOTTOM LINE> At $19.95 (the Amazon price when I bought mine), as good a Sonicare toothbrush as you can buy for ANY price. The extra features of more expensive models have little or no practical value. CAVEAT -- the models with variable intensity settings might be desirable for individuals with very delicate gums, such as young children.> MY EXPERIENCE \u2013 The battery of my old Sonicare Series 1, Model 4100 (which was my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush), purchased in 2007, began to operate only 4-5 days (used daily) between charges (instead of 20-25 days per charge), so I purchased a Sonicare Essence (nominally a Series 1, Model 5611) to replace it.> The new Sonicare Essence 5611 is virtually identical to my old Sonicare 4100. The only differences are that the handle of the Essence is 1/2\" shorter, and the charger base is more compact (and the handle has a slightly different shape so as to fit only the new charger base). Both take the same Series 1e toothbrush heads. Both use non-replaceable rechargeable NiMH batteries. Both operate identically.> The charger base of the Sonicare Essence brush I received is MUCH more compact than in the (current as of 7/21/2017) illustrations on the corresponding Amazon page. The slightly smaller size of the handle and much smaller charger base makes the Essence more travel friendly.>>Update: Unlike my old model, the Sonicare Essence 5611 warns you when the battery is low, but it doesn't just die --- you can finish brushing before recharging.CONS> These days most chargers for small electronics are \u201cuniversal\u201d (they will adapt to any voltage between 110 and 240 volts). However, the charger base of the Model HX5611/01 I received is 110-120v 50-60hz ONLY\u2014which means that you can\u2019t (for example) use it in Brazil with a simple plug adapter (you\u2019d have to use a more expensive voltage adapter\u2014or buy a Sonicare model which has a universal charger or a charger which matches your voltage). A few weeks ago, I spent 2 weeks in Germany. My hotel had a few 110v outlets (hurray!) in addition to the 220v outlets, which operated my other 110v electronics just fine -- however, my Sonicare would NOT charge. I don't know how widespread this problem may be, but it is possible that you may have to have a native 220v Sonicare charger and brush (powerhead) to work in Europe.> You need to take the bush head off after every use (to let it dry out)--- otherwise a black slime garden will grow inside (below the brush retainer cap). Since you have to take the brush head off after every use, two or more individuals can easily share a single handle. You may need to purchase extra brush heads. Note that \u201cgeneric\u201d series 1e brush heads are inexpensive and work fine.> The sculpted turquoise \"racing stripes\" look like finger grips (and even match my 2NICE Water Flosser), and even have a rubberized surface, presumably for a better grip -- a good idea. However, in use, your thumb and finger tips never touch the \"racing stripes\".> The included travel case offered with more expensive models MIGHT be desirable for some folks. However, the $15 optional canvas case Sonicare Essence Canvas Travel Case - Made by Phillips Sonicare , is better for travel because it takes less travel space and weighs less. UPDATE: After a year, I never bother with a travel case> The smaller charger base I received with my Sonicare Essence may be less stable (that is, it may be easier to knock over a handle in the base)---and you can't store the power cord in the base. But, I prefer the smaller charger base---it takes less precious real estate on my crowded sink top, and less space in my suitcase when traveling. UPDATE: After a year, I've never accidentally knocked over a Sonicare handle in its charger base.> The instructions recommend that you store the brush in the (plugged-in) charger base when not in use. In contrast, instructions for previous models recommended users to run down the battery completely between charges. Without getting into a lengthy and highly-debatable esoteric discussion of battery charging, the bottom line is storing the brush in the charger base is the most convenient option for most users. But if that is more convenient for you (as it happens to be for me), it is perfectly okay to just charge the Sonicare once every two or three weeks, and in fact, it MAY extend the battery life.> Speaking of the batteries, the instruction manual includes instructions on removing the batteries. You can remove them, but you can NOT replace them (I actually tried to do with my first $200 Sonicare). The battery removal instructions are for the eco-friendly disposal of the brush and batteries ONLY---not for maintenance or repair.> Note that if you purchase a Sonicare Essence from a vendor other than Amazon (or at a later date even from Amazon), you might get something different from the Model HX5611/01 that I received. The Philips website doesn\u2019t even have an option for registering Model HX5611/01. (albeit, presumably registering it as an HX5620 will work). The difference between similar models probably will not matter to you.OTHER REVIEWER'S COMPLAINTS> Some reviewers claim that the 2 and/or 3 series are quieter than the 1 series (including the Essence) (which allegedly \"buzzes\" or \"rattles\"). Actually, if you just tighten (a slight twist) the retainer cap of the brush section, it doesn't buzz or rattle.> Some reviewers claim that this is an \"economy\" model which has been compromised by lower quality construction. Mine is the 5th Sonicare I've owned over the past 30 years. The Essence is of the same high quality of construction as my old model 4100 that it is replacing. I haven't owned a series 2 or 3 for comparison, so I cannot speak to their comparative quality.> Some reviewers claim that the Essence is less expensive because Sonicare substituted cheaper NiMH batteries (instead of more expensive lithium batteries). My old model 4100 that the Essence is replacing also has NiMH batteries which until recently operated about 20 days (used daily) between charges. The batteries in my old 4100 lasted for 10 years---and still operate 4-5 days (used daily) between charges. If I recharged my old 4100 daily (i.e., by storing the brush in the plugged-in charger base, as Sonicare now recommends) my ancient 4100 would still be working just fine.> CONCLUSION -- The Essence apparently is Sonicare's \"economy model\" -- but I see no evidence of cheaper or lower quality construction. All I see in the more expensive models are \"doodads\" (such as a useless travel case) and useless features tacked on to justify a higher price, for individuals who MUST have the \"best\" (most expensive) model of anything.",

                "reviewText": "I have used a Sonicare for over a decade. I bought my first one at my dentists office. I bought a few throughout the years and then got an Oral B on sale. I was shocked at how loud the oral b was after having used the sonicare. Oral B is loud and rough, like having a small jack hammer in your mouth. I bought this version of sonicare and now use it instead of the oral b. its so quiet and it fits in my mouth nicely. will never buy another oral b. will stick to sonicare. nice and quiet and effective.",
