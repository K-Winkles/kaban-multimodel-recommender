                "reviewText": "I really like powered toothbrushes, makes my teeth feel much more clean and how Quip addressed powered toothbrushes with this product, I think they did it right. I really love the cover that comes with it. It's super easy to travel with this thing and it keeps the brush clean while it's sitting in the bathroom waiting for the next use (you know what I'm referring to!). The bristles last a good amount of time and the battery does as well (you CAN change the battery but getting to it is a little difficult but doable). They also have brush replacements, but I find these on sale every now and then so sometimes I'll just get a new one. The timing feature is really nice as well. There are little pulses that I use to move to a different side of the mouth or bottom/top depending on what I've already brushed. This has been helpful as I know in the past I didn't brush as long as I probably should. Now I find that it's really easy to do a full 2 minutes.Overall, this is a great toothbrush, been using one for years and I'm really happy with the results. I'd like to try their high end ones but I'm not sure what advantage I would get from that.",

                "reviewText": "I had a Sonicare before this that I liked, but the replacement heads were expensive, the toothbrush was bulky, and even at low settings the vibration was sometimes a bit strong for me. My kid (who has sensory issues) hated using hers and hasn't liked most powered toothbrushes, but isn't great at brushing thoroughly with a manual one, so we tried these.I like the reusable strip that sticks the case to a mirror - it's great at keeping the bristles covered and the brush in plain view. Kids tend to forget when it's not right in front of them and the cover is perfect for throwing in a bag for a sleepover. The brush is light and the vibration level is gentle, but still feels like the level of cleanliness we were getting from the Sonicare. She brushes much more consistently with this and it isn't a fight. It's simple and easy to use and the replacement heads are affordable. Exactly what I was hoping for.",

It becomes hard to turn on and may turn itself off repeatedly while using it, even with a new battery. In spite of that, it is still worthwhile, just plan on replacing the whole unit every two years.",

                "reviewText": "I had heard countless radio ads for the Quip electric toothbrush, so when my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush died, I decided to give the Quip a try. Apparently, this company spends more money on radio ads than they would ever consider spending on quality control. Right out of the box, the toothbrush was hard to turn on and then kept shutting down after 3 to 4 seconds. I thought that it might be the battery, but after changing it out with a brand new one, it was still the same. Hard to turn on and kept \"Quipping\" (quitting)! The couple of times that it did stay on long enough to begin brushing my teeth, the \"vibrations' (if you could call them that) were not even slightly comparable to my previous Phillips sonicare toothbrush. This toothbrush is no different than just a plain toothbrush, aside from the fact that it costs much more. I was so disgusted with it, that I threw it in the trash and didn't even mess with the return process.I should have read the other reviews instead of just looking at the number of stars that others had awarded this product.I got back on Amazon and checked out other electric toothbrushes and ultimately tried the Dnsly rechargeable electric toothbrush for adults. It was like night and day! What a difference! For the same price as the Quip ($20), this toothbrush rivals the Phillips Sonicare and blows the Quip right out of the water! It is easy to turn on, it STAYS on and it's vibration and cleaning is tremendous! It also has five diffent modes of vibration and a two minute timer with a one second pause every 30 seconds to remind you to reposition the brush on your teeth. Lastly, it looks good, stands on its own and does the job that I expect it to, it deep cleans my teeth.Don't waste your time and money and be persuaded by multiple radio ads like I was. The Quip quits before it starts!",

I\u2019m not sure why it won\u2019t always turn on when I need it or why it powers on at random times. It\u2019s not very common but it\u2019s enough to be a little bothersome.",
