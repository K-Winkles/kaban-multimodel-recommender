The tapered V Arc design allows you to brush your teeth and also your gumline at the same time, leaving fresh and clean results every time.I would highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone, even just to try it.Its definitely worth it.",

It's so easy and cheap to get the bottom rung dollar store deals and throw them away.On first use, it was so soft and gentle. Felt like a super foamy tire detail brush.The texture after brushing was noticably much smoother than normal.Better overall clean feeling.A+ all around.",
