The fact that it comes with a cap is a game-changer for me \u2013 it keeps the bristles clean and makes it easy to carry in my bag without worrying about hygiene. The toothbrush itself has a comfortable grip, and the bristles are gentle yet effective in cleaning. I appreciate the attention to detail in the design, and the cap is definitely a standout feature for me. If you're looking for a reliable toothbrush that also considers convenience, this is a solid choice!",
