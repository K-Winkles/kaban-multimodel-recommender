                "reviewText": "Full disclosure: I am a big Colgate fan-girl from way back...I have been using their products for years and will continue to do so simply because they make products that I can trust to promote and support both my and my family\u2019s dental health. So, that said, I was excited to try brand new toothbrushes from Colgate!These toothbrushes are even better than I imagined! They are soft-bristled, which I feel everyone should be using...soft-bristled brushes go easy on your enamel and your gums. If you look closely at how the bristles are arranged, they are shaped into spirals...if you brush your teeth in circular motion, this will have the effect of gently spin-brushing your teeth. In amongst the spirals are some rubber pieces that help to take stains off of your teeth. On the back of the head of the toothbrush is a tongue/cheek cleaner. Colgate has thought of everything!I think, though, what I like most about this toothbrush and Colgate\u2019s toothbrushes, in general, is that they have good long, unobtrusive handles that reach back in the mouth easily. I still have my wisdom teeth, so I need that sort of reach out of my toothbrush. I\u2019ve tried others that just didn\u2019t work...either the handle was too short or it was too thick...but Colgate always designs theirs just right! This toothbrush does everything I need it to and it looks pretty darned cool, too! I also like that they come in different colours, for the most part...I do wish that they came in four different colours instead of three, though...that way, four family members can get new toothbrushes out of one pack and not have to worry about mixing them up.At $14.97 (at time of writing) for four toothbrushes, each toothbrush costs just under $3.75 which isn\u2019t bad for the latest toothbrush technology by a trusted name in dental products. I am happy to give Colgate\u2019s 360 Advanced Optic White toothbrushes my most enthusiastic recommendation!",

                "reviewText": "Considering I have fairly sensitive gums, I was a little shocked at how well these worked for me despite being soft bristles and not extra-soft ones. It offers a good brushing experience; the combination of the specific lengths variation and shapes makes it tough enough for stains yet soft enough for sensitive gums for most instances.Despite having the polishing bristles that tend to get in the way of proper cleaning between the teeth along the gum line, this one is good and it doesn't get in the way.The handle ergonomics are good and make it easy to use. The grip pad is comfortable but... let's also be honest it's very fun to squish. The tongue scraper might be a little too soft to actually do anything though. It can be used to loosen stuff but not to scrape at the very least. Of course the downside to this type of handle is that it has a lost of composite materials that make it harder to dispose responsibly--or upcycle in the right facilities. As such it will be basically landfill material.At about 3.75$ per brush, it is pretty average priced and for the performance pretty respectable.",

Although these brushes cost a bit more than my usual 99c option ($3.75 per brush at time of review) I would absolutely buy them again.The handle on these brushes is great. It's thick but tapers where your thumb holds it - it sits easily in my hand. The handle is clear plastic swirled with a color (4 pk of brushes, assorted colors) and looks a bit nicer than a standard plastic toothbrush. The bristles are awesome - nice and soft, so they don't irritate my gums, but the toothbrush head is PACKED with bristles so it feels very thorough while I'm brushing. Does this toothbrush whiten my teeth? No, I don't think so...I haven't noticed any difference. But the act of brushing alone can help whiten teeth, so it certainly doesn't hurt. I really like these toothbrushes. Great hand feel, excellent clean mouth feeling after brushing. There's a tongue scrubber on the back of the brush head, which I appreciate. I will absolutely buy these brushes again.",
