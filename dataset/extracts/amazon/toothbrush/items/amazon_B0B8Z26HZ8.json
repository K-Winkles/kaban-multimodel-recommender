The flosser feature is extremely effective and easy to use. Plus, since there is no huge water container attached to the base, it is extremely convenient and portable-you just get a small container/drinking glass or whatever you have available and put the water in the container. The hose from the flosser attachment goes into the container and provides the water needed for the flosser (you can use the flosser alone or while brushing). This product is great, and the price was excellent! We ordered a second one for my wife and are extremely happy we did!",

It has replaced 3 appliances and freed up quite a bit of space in my small bathroom! It's easy to use and am very pleased with the operation! I would buy again!! My only criticism is that it can roll on counter when placed down on its side.",

                "reviewText": "I'm old fashioned and was hesitant to try this new-fangled combo set but I'm certainly glad I took the plunge. It is incredible!!! The pick feature is comfortably strong and removes so much from between the teeth; switch to the brush and you get wonderfully clean teeth. Plus you can flip on the water again at the end while brushing and rinse any residue away that the pick didn't get. Two shots at cleaning between teeth and get super clean teeth with just one single tool, who could ask for more. One more thing I like is the small space that is required to store it, rather than a whole shelf for my other two large separate cleaning tools. The water vessel in this picture is an empty \"Power Aide\" container that is perfect for this operation. It holds the right amount of water for the whole procedure with a little to spare. Since I drink one a day, I swap out my bottle often.This is such a wonderful dental tool and I know you will be just as happy as I that you gave it a try. In addition, the price is reasonable for all the features you get. I'm happy to put my old clunky equipment to rest. My dentist is going to be very happy with me at my next checkup, yay!!!",

Also travel friendly, the battery lasts over a week and only needing a cup of water for the water flosser. Easy to use, and sits in my hand naturally, not bulky or heavy but sturdy. Worth the price and would recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their toothbrush.",
