We continue to take an active role in the worldwide advancement of oral health and dental care. Dr. John O. Butler, a periodontist from Chicago, started the Company in 1923 with the introduction of a 2-row, 12 tuft, wide-handled toothbrush that answered the specific need of dental professionals for a fine quality toothbrush that met oral hygiene requirements. Toothbrushes at that time were too large and bulky to reach all the way to the back of the mouth. They were made in various shapes and sizes designed mostly for appearance rather than for any scientific reason.",

                "reviewText": "I have been buying these exact toothbrushes for decades. I'm fanatical about my oral hygiene, and I replace my toothbrush every two to three months without fail. I first got this brand of toothbrush at my dentist's office as a gift with my checkup a very, very long time ago, and for ages you could only get them through a dentist's office. I noticed the great difference between the GUM brand and the drugstore brands immediately, and I was hooked! You can't go wrong with the GUM brand. They are the only toothbrushes I use. I always buy the \"soft\" bristle choice and I now always buy the full-sized head, though the compact heads work great as well. Before finding these offered on Amazon, I used to purchase these in bulk directly from the manufacturer for the same great price of about $1.50 per brush. It sure beats the $4.00 to $5.00 per toothbrush charged for these at retail stores. Anyway, it was time to reorder and I was totally amazed to find these offered on Amazon at such a great price. These are high quality toothbrushes, designed and engineered with your best oral health in mind. The variety of colors that come in one order is not only fun, but allows multiple family members to easily distinguish which of the four colors is theirs. Whenever I go for a dental visit, the dentist and hygienists always comment on how amazingly clean my teeth are and how very healthy my gums are. Though I am really attentive to my oral care, I always feel like these toothbrushes are an extremely helpful part of my decay-fighting arsenal. I highly recommend these toothbrushes and any toothbrushes manufactured by GUM. As an aside, these toothbrushes are such great quality that I will rarely throw one away. Once past their prime and ready for replacement, I simply disinfect the brush I'm done with and store it elsewhere for later use in household cleaning tasks. I've used them for cleaning my jewelry, detailing my car, cleaning the nooks and crannies in my bathroom or kitchen, scrubbing stains out of laundry. The list is endless, but the most important use is in keeping my smile as clean and healthy as possible. Yup, I love these toothbrushes!",
