                "reviewText": "I like the concept of a reusable manual toothbrush handle and how the Colgate Keep Deep Clean Floss-Tip Toothbrush can reduce plastic waste by up to 80%. The handle is well constructed of durable lightweight aluminum, comfortable to hold, simple to clean. However, it might not fit in some of the standard/decorative toothbrush holders but it will fit in most travel cases. The soft floss-tip brush bristles do a great job cleaning the hard-to-reach places, the brush head clips securely onto the handle, has a tongue cleaner on the back side, stays firmly in place, is easy to replace, and lasts for 2-3 months. I like that the Starter Kit included 2 Brush Heads and this one was reasonably priced as compared to other sellers. It\u2019s a great value for the price and helps decrease environmental costs!",

                "reviewText": "I think it's a great idea, but in order for it to really take off Colgate should transition all their toothbrush offerings to this system to A) further reduce overall plastic usage and B) ensure customers that they'll never have to worry about the whole \"keep\" line of products being cancelled, leaving them with a useless aluminum decoration. That said, the handle itself is surprisingly ergonomic and feels very premium compared to a standard plastic toothbrush. The handle and two brush heads for $4-6 (depending on color option, at time of writing) feels like a very fair price, I just wish it would become their standard offering rather than some \"specialty product\" to check a box for \"environmentally conscious consumers\" or whatever naming convention they surely use.",

                "reviewText": "Pro:- feels GREAT, which motivates me to brush- looks lovely which also motivates me to brush- the heads are replaceable so you finally can justify buying a tooth brush head instead of buying an entire toothbrush.Con:- the heads might be a liiiitle too rough. I wish they had other softer heads as other options.",

Lightweight, easy & comfortable to hold and brush. Time will tell if it\u2019s build quality lasts and how long it will go. Best thing is that can replace the brush head without replacing the whole thing. What more can you want and ask for in a every essential and necessity :)",
