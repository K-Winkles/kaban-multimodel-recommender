                "reviewText": "I originally purchased these when searching for a very soft bristled brush. I'm undergoing treatment for cancer, and I often have a lot of sensitivity and sores in my mouth. They do a great job of allowing me to brush with minimal discomfort. However, I was surprised at how clean my teeth feel when I use these brushes, and how the soft, fine bristles get between the teeth. I didn't expect them to work better than my old brushes. I've seen my dentist twice since I started using these, and I had less plaque than previous visits, and my receding gums have recovered to a large degree. The best part is that these are very affordable, and it's not a big deal to change your brush every couple months. I will not be going back to the fancy big-brand brushes. I just purchased a package of the bamboo handle Nuva Dent brushes, and I'm hoping they are as good. I'm trying to reduce my use of disposable plastic.",

                "reviewText": "Basics: Items arrived very fast, packaged well and the price is very difficult to beat.Softness: These brushes are so pleasantly soft you almost don't think they will do the job until, that is, you finish brushing and notice just how well they DID do the job. Of course the bristles are extremely soft but in addition, the diameter of each bristle allows them to get between teeth and up under the gums without feeling like needles piercing your gums. After four days of use there is a visible difference in both our teeth and our gums.Whitening: I didn't buy these for whitening, I bought them for the softness and the anti-bacterial properties of Activated charcoal. If they are contributing to the whitening that is an added bonus but in truth, there are tons of products on the market to help with whitening. Buy these brushes for comfort and cleaning capabilities.Overall I am extremely satisfied with these brushes. My whole family uses them and my teens are very eager to brush their teeth. In just a few days everyone's dental hygiene has improved markedly and we are happy to have them.Negative: There is only one negative that I can list here - at least as far as my household is concerned - and that is that we have 5 in my household, we have to use sharpies to mark the toothbrushes as they only seem to come in two colors. If you are buying these for yourself, or you have a smaller household, this negative will likely not apply for you.",

                "reviewText": "I love these toothbrushes. First of all they are so nice and light; and, I had others that claimed to be very very soft and these are even softer, while still making you feel like your teeth are getting clean. Doing a soft tissue once over is easy as the the head is not too huge.. but still covers a lot of ground. One thing to note, and why I gave 4 stars on the easy to hold title, there is not much in the way of grip, although the size, shape, and weight is fabulous. I don't end up with toothpaste all over my handle (it could make things slippery for others) so this is not a problem at all for me, PLUS, I appreciate how the lack of super-grips makes it very very easy to maneuver the toothbrush around your mouth (think soft tissue cleaning). Final point - with my prior set, my toothpaste got stuck in the bottom of the brushes. I hate that look! No amount of rinsing helped. This is NOT a problem with these! I will buy again for sure and highly recommend :)",

                "reviewText": "Lets start with the positive:The bristles are nice and soft without being too rough on the gums, but I think most people won't like this because they are used to medium strength bristles.The shape is similar to other brands I've used, so it feel familiar in my hand, and the value isn't too bad compared to plastic handled brushes.Now the negative:I feel like I'm using a tongue depressor with some bristles on it. The head of the toothbrush feels like it could handle some more bristles being added to it.I wish I read the description better because I'm trying to go minimal to zero waste with certain products and this looked like a great buy. Be aware that the toothbrush is NOT 100% compostable. It has nylon bristles that ARE NOT compostable. You will have to remove the bristles before composting the handle.The packaging on the outside is nice because it's cardboard and easily compostable, BUT when you open the package, the toothbrushes are individually packaged in what looks like paper packaging, but it's actually lined with plastic. I was very disappointed to find this out. The packaging was the biggest let down in my opinion.My husband and I will continue to use these until they are spent, but I will not purchase these again.",
