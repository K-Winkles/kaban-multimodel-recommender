If I take the time to brush thoroughly, my teeth feel clean and polished. I personally appreciate the softness, after years of using harder bristles I've learned that's not great for your enamel. So, I think these fit all of the criteria for a great brush. Plus, I really like the sleek black look!",

                "reviewText": "The wife here: I have had these toothbrushes in the past and it was an issue with the brushes themselves, not Amazon or Ulta. The black toothbrush didn't shed its bristles, but the white one did, for some reason or another. It's not bad, mostly just a weird feeling of the bristle being in your mouth for a moment, then you spit it out. If that bothers you, don't buy these, but the benefits FAR outweigh that element. I love how soft the bristles are and how well they clean my teeth. I don't push down nearly as hard as I do with other brushes, and it helps my extremely sensitive teeth (which get irritated easily and definitely need some work - but no money for that, so this is my temporary solution). Definitely will continue to buy these as long as they are available. I wish they had an electric toothbrush version. Psst, hey moon, make an electric toothbrush with replaceable heads!",

                "reviewText": "The Moon toothbrush impresses with its sleek matte black finish and comfortable handle. The bristles offer a pleasant brushing experience, but the slightly wide head size can be challenging for reaching back molars. Overall, a stylish and ergonomic choice, though consider personal preferences for maneuverability.",
