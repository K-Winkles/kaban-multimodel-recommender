                "reviewText": "This toothbrush is really great because it has 3 modes. Clean, whiten, and gum care. I have owned sonicare toothbrushes for about the last 30 year's. I'm having a problem with this brush but it is all due to sonicare customer service. The people working there don't know what they're doing and they put me on hold constantly. My amber light on my brush came on and the first representative I talked to told me I needed a new charger. I looked up the information in the manual and saw that this means I need new toothbrush heads. I don't think I have had the brush that long to need new heads already. My other brushes were not like this. Well good luck getting a representative to tell you which brush head is correct for your brush. Every person told me a different thing. Also, they wanted the serial number on the bottom of my brush which I can't read because I am 65 years old and cannot see this number. I have my model number. Anyway, eventually I was told I need toothbrush head HX 9062. I put this on my Amazon wishlist to save it since I was given so many different toothbrush head numbers. They mailed me a diamond head brush head. It's the wrong head but they said it doesn't matter as they all snap on. I am so disappointed in Sonicare. I remember buying toothbrushes from them and when they stopped working they mailed you a new one. This customer service now is horrible. They have absolutely no customer service. My son just got a job with Phillips recently working in a laboratory building ultrasound machines. I told him about my problems and he said sonicare is outsourced. That is obvious by their lack of knowledge and customer service. This is additional information since my original post. Today I received 3 packages from FedEx with toothbrush heads. Two of the heads are correct and one is incorrect. I will save myself from all this stress by ordering from Amazon",

                "reviewText": "Bought 2nd one as a replacement, Philip's customer service is usually great. Battery lasts great, even after 3+ years of use. Both toothbrushes had the same issue, the vibrating tip comes loose after a year or two. You'll notice the tip is wobbly and the brush sounds louder. Reason for that is that the tip is fastened with a simple metal screw which when vibrating over time tends to get loose or in my case entirely undone. There's a video on how to fix it relatively easily, but I wish it would not come loose at all.",

I find it really easy to replace the brush head- not difficult to pull off or put a new one on. I love that this toothbrush has a light come on to remind when to replace a new one. I bought the replacement heads here on Amazon as well for like a pack of 12 or so. Not a bad price either. Lastly, I went on a weekend trip and didn\u2019t pack the charger. The charge held up for the weekend as well. I also liked the added bonus of having a case for this toothbrush. Overall, this is better than my last electric toothbrush and has held up so far.",

I\u2019ve never felt such a difference after brushing!The beginning took me a bit to get used to the feeling noise etc but I don\u2019t have any issues now!Best to use a rechargeable one like this since batteries lessen the cleaning power over time as they wear down and you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s low u like this one tells you!The case is durable and slim for easy travel, it says the battery is 14 days but it\u2019s gone longer for me with regular brushing !",
