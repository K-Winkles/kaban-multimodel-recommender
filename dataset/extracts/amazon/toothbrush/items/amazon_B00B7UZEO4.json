                "reviewText": "I have used these conventional toothbrushes for years, as I cannot tolerate a vibrating toothbrush. I have used soft, but I prefer \"ultra soft,\" because it is very gentle on the gums. The ergonomic handle and small brush head make it super easy to get to the back teeth and to also get a good angle to clean your gums. They come in a variety of primary and pastel colors. They are recycled plastic, and you can recycle the toothbrush and the wrapper. These toothbrushes are very simple, yet because they are designed well, they do the job beautifully- no cavities for years! They are also very reasonably priced compared to most conventional toothbrushes. I very highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I wish I could remember how long I've been using this brand of toothbrush, but it's been more than 2 to 3 years. I always get the softest bristles available, and they do the job great!! The ergonomics of the toothbrush and handle are awesome, so it makes brushing easier than with the usual, standard toothbrushes. I have a mobility disability, which makes doing even small, seemingly simple things like toothbrushing difficult and very painful, as I also have arthritis in my small joints, along with the bigger ones like my shoulders and elbows. Thanks to this toothbrush though, I find this daily \"duty\" to my body and health easier than when I used to use a typical toothbrush. THANK YOU SO MUCH!",

I don\u2019t understand why the other toothbrush makers didn\u2019t adopt this design . I\u2019ve been using these for years. I always buy soft which doesn\u2019t last as long as the medium or hard ones but it feels more gentle on my gums and teeth",
