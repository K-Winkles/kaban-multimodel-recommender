                "reviewText": "I get the negative reviews. I really do. If you're a normal person with healthy gums, or even mild gingivitis, then I honestly wouldn't recommend this toothbrush. The bristles are too densely packed and fine, incapable of cleaning between teeth or scouring off plaque and tartar. It definitely does not function like a regular toothbrush that we're all used to.So you may be thinking, ok, so what is the point in buying this if it isn't going to do what you need it to do? And I say this: this toothbrush likely isn't going to cut it for the average consumer. But this toothbrush is an absolute miracle if you're like me and have severe gum disease. The kind whereby even the most \"extra soft\" conventional toothbrush is painful to use, even when brushing gently.My most painful area is the hard palate, right behind my front teeth. It's a vicious circle: I need to brush there to strengthen my gums, but brushing is painful so I avoid that spot. Look, I've been dealing with gum disease and bone loss for years, and I must have tried every toothbrush on the market. None of them were pain-free and resulted in my continuing neglect of the painful areas. This toothbrush was literally the cure. No joke, the first time I used it I had NO gum or palate pain. I honestly couldn't believe it! Needless to say, it helped tremendously in getting my gums back to a state where they're now healthy enough to handle an extra soft conventional toothbrush.There is definitely a market for this kind of toothbrush. This is who I think would really love it:1) I consider this to be more of a gum brush than a toothbrush. People with extremely sensitive and/or painful gums I think will really appreciate the comfort these nano bristles provide. This need not be your permanent toothbrush... Just step one in the process of gum recovery. When your gums get stronger, you can graduate up to a more conventional brush.2) People who brush more than the average person that may be experiencing damage to their enamel. Or, if you NEED to brush your teeth immediately before or after eating which isn't recommended since brushing temporarily damages enamel for around 30 minutes or so leaving your teeth prone to tooth decay. Firm isn't always better when it comes to preserving enamel.Yes, like I said, it isn't really an ideal toothbrush if you're looking for what you're used to. It's not a one-and-done tool. It's still absolutely necessary to floss and mouth rinse to separate anything stuck between your teeth. If you were already doing those things anyway, then this toothbrush shouldn't be that much of a leap from what you'd expect. It's just weird at first because of how soft and densely packed the bristles are.",

                "reviewText": "I was born prematurely. As a result, my mouth has less room to \"move around\" in. The rear portion is so small that I don't have the second set of molars, nor do I have wisdom teeth.I have spent decades searching for a toothbrush that can not only fit comfortably behind my back teeth, but do a good job at cleaning. THIS IS IT!It's not tiny, by any means, but it is compact. It cleans thoroughly, without irritation. I could hardly even feel it.Some people don't like soft toothbrushes, so this will not be the brush for them. Some people like to hear the brush scrubbing their teeth; this toothbrush is not for them, as it scrubs and polishes silently.If you want a toothbrush with a compact head that cleans thoroughly and effortlessly without irritating sensitive gum tissue, buy this.I'm glad it came as a two-pack; I'm using the black one with my charcoal power (note: the charcoal powder gets shoved down at the base of the bristles if you brush too hard, and takes a lot of work to get out because the bristles are so densely packed) , and the white one for regular brushing. I'm also ordering another set right now, as I never want to be without them.As some other reviewers noted, there's the issue of stuff getting caught in the bristles, bacteria from not drying properly, etc. To remedy this, simply run the brush under water and rub it in your palm or with your fingers to dislodge food particles, squeeze the sides to remove excess moisture, squirt the bristles with peroxide, and tap off the extra. Voila. Clean, less-germy toothbrush.This thing makes me want to never stop brushing my teeth. Seriously.",

                "reviewText": "This was delivered 10 minutes ago - just in time for me to brush after finishing coffee and breakfast. All can say after the first use is (and pardon the language) WHERE THE HELL HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE???Let me tell you that, as someone in their late 50s who is on all kinds of meds or a chronic illness, my teeth are in horrible shape. They look fine on the surface but my gums are damaged, bleeding and sore. I have been using baking soda and a rag to clean in the most tender spots because even the softest \"regular\" brushes are too harsh. I will be vulnerable and honestly say that I haven't had a rigorous brushing for at least 2 years. The actual disease is bad enough but the infusions I am on have really added to the tooth damage.I am only upset that not one doctor or dentist has ever told me about this kind of brush. I will be spreading the word.By the way, since the brush is so very gentle, I was able to brush with baking soda and a tea tree oil paste. Yes, I did need to brush for a longer period (about 5 minutes) but the brush felt so wonderful against my gums that I didn't mind. Now, instead of half-cleaning my teeth and gums with a soft rag, I can brush multiple times a day, Who knows - maybe I can fix some of the damage?I am not sure how long these will last. The brushes themselves seem to hold up well after being wettened and used vigorously, but the packaging was kind of cheap-looking. Just to be safe, I am going to order more to have on hand. I don't want to ever be out of this type of toothbrush and I can't wait to tell others about it.",

I will say, the bristles feel great. Definitely the softest toothbrush I've used. However, since the bristles are all densely packed, there is no way for them to dry out. This results in a gross brownish layer at the base of the bristles. Didn't even use this for 6 months before that occurred. I will keep the other one to brush my cats' teeth as they need something super soft. I wouldn't buy this product again.",
