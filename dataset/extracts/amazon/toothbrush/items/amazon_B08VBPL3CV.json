            "DESIGNED WITH BOTH YOU AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN MIND - The Jordan Green Clean Toothbrush is made of 90% recycled materials. The handle is made using 100% recycled plastic from e.g. yoghurt, margarine and food tubs while the remaining 10 % (the bristle) is 100 % bio-based",
            "ERGONOMIC AND EFFICIENT - The soft toothbrush is made of 100% bio-based nylon and the narrow soft brush lets you easily access hard to reach places. As opposed to other eco-friendly toothbrushes, Jordan Green Clean is ergonomic and completely neutral in taste",
            "ECO FRIENDLY PRODUCTS - The eco friendly toothbrushes comes in eco-friendly packaging that is made entirely from recycled paper fibres. By using paper scrap creatively, it is recycled into something protective and useful. The packaging label is made by FSC-certified paper from responsibly managed forests, making the eco toothbrush a great sustainable gift",
            "SCANDINAVIAN DESIGN - Simplicity and functionality coupled with a love for the environment, this is the philosophy of the Jordan Green Clean, designed by the famous Nordic designer Andreas Engesvik. In the design process, nothing has been left to chance, and only sustainable materials are used",
            "AWARD WINNING - As a validation of our work, we won a sustainability award at the IdentiPlast in March 2019 because Jordan Green Clean is both sustainable, efficient and ergonomic. By using recycled material, we maintain the value of materials for as long as possible and are part of a circular economy. The toothbrush you will receive will be a random colour of either pink, blue or green"

Jordan has helped people with tailored quality products and encouragement to take care of their teeth for decades. Therefore we have developed Green Clean, a toothbrush range with extra focus on careful use of resources, without compromising on the quality of your oral care. Why reclaimed plastics? Plastic is a fantastic material \u2013 used correctly. The material allows to make safe, hygienic and functional toothbrushes. However; virgin plastic is based on non-renewable sources. Plastic that is already in the ecosystem should be reused. By using rreclaimed plastics we are using waste instead of virgin natural resources as well as reducing litter",

The full sized head is densely populated with bristles...seems to have at least twice the tufts of many of the modern overengineered brushes. I'm old-school and to me common sense says, more bristles = better cleaning. And the bristles...they're soft with the perfect firmness for me. The simple, clean Scandinavian designed handles are super comfortable to hold, without the overused soft plastic I find so unnecessary in almost every other brush. They also seem very durable. It's been over three months on my first brush, and the bristles are just starting to bend...and I brush very hard and long (both not recommended I know).I'm 76, been through more toothbrushes than most, and these are the best brushes I've ever used. Plus...the plastics and the packaging are from recycled materials, and the bristles are bio-based (derived from materials of biological origin...renewable, not petro-based).",

They are way softer than my normal Oral B 35 flat trim brushes, which are extremely soft. I will not purchase these again, they do not clean my teeth very well.",

                "reviewText": "My teeth feel so clean! So we bought these because the reviews were really good but we weren\u2019t expecting to love these so much. My boyfriend and I had electric quip style toothbrushes from another store that we honestly hated. They were so refreshing to use after that. The bristles are soft that I feel like I can really get in there with them and my teeth feel so clean. My boyfriend has gum issues and these do not irritate his gums at all. Will repurchase again when we need new tooth brushes.",
