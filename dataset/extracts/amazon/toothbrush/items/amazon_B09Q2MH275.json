                "reviewText": "This is the only baby toothbrush I know of that actually looks like a regular toothbrush with the bristles feeling like a regular toothbrush but you can clean it easily with soap and water after each use - much more hygienic than a regular toothbrush! A great way for my 9-month old to learn how to brush her teeth. The brushes I\u2019ve tried before she liked to chew on, sure, but now she is actually brushing her teeth on her own while dad and I do. If it doesn\u2019t look like a toothbrush to them, they\u2019re not going to use it like one! Great product and super cute. Very easy for baby to handle",

Well she finally got her own and now she won\u2019t it it down! I love that it\u2019s easy to clean and the bristles are super soft. Not to mention the suction at the bottom is amazing and the fact that it looks like a flower is a plus. Absolutely love!!",

My feral child has started to chew her tooth brushes to the point where the bristles look crazy or just plane bites the head off of tooth brush.While it was a cute toothbrush and would be great for other kids, it did not hold up to my child and she actually bit through the silicone and the head fell off.8/10 overall but 0/10 for withstanding my kid and her chewing antics",
