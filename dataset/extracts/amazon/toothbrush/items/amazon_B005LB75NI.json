I have tried many \"soft\" toothbrushes. Most were too hard and irritating. The others were too soft, and didn't do a thorough job of cleaning.\"Nimbus Extra Soft Toothbrushes With Tapered Bristles\" is the answer. Very easy on the gums, the longer extra-soft bristles on the edges effectively & gently clean the gumline while the shorter soft bristles in the center effectively clean the teeth. Feels great while brushing, absolutely no irritation, my gums & teeth feel healthy & clean. An ingenious design, flawlessly executed. Also, the head size is just right, and the tapered angled handle reaches behind the teeth. Nicely fits the hand. And the materials, finish & quality is outstanding.I hope they continue to be available.",

Recently at a drugstore I saw a similar looking type of cloud toothbrush by a big manufacturer, ('Colgate Gum Health Extra Soft Toothbrush for Sensitive Gums with Deep Cleaning Floss-Tip Bristles' I think)- so I got those thinking it would be easier than ordering more of these. But on the first use of the Colgate bristles came loose!!! and got stuck in the back of my throat- it was scary. These Nimbus toothbrushes do NOT shed, and hold up very well for long use. Love them! Hold lightly, no need to scrub nor poke them into your gums. Thanks for making these!",

                "reviewText": "This is the best soft bristle toothbrush I have tried! I've tried many other soft bristle toothbrushes, and this is the first that is soft, cleans well, and does not shed bristles. I have always brushed my teeth roughly and fast, and unfortunately, this has caused me to start having receding gums that are sensitive and end up bleeding. My dentist has told me it doesn't take much pressure to clean teeth well, and I've been trying to do this. I like my teeth to feel polished and super smooth, and this toothbrush does that for me. I catch myself brushing hard, and it doesn't cause any pain or bleeding. None of the toothbrushes advertised in the grocery store as sensitive and soft work for me. I have also used the many bristle toothbrushes off Amazon, but these always start shedding within a week or two. I hope this review helps someone and they give these toothbrushes a chance. These also come individually wrapped, which is excellent for keeping in my bathroom closet or bringing on a trip. I've used the yellow toothbrush in the photo for over a month, and it's holding up well.",
