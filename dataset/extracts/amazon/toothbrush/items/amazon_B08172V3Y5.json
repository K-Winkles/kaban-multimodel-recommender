Bonus Fact: they actually do a good job of cleaning, leaving teeth feeling smooth & polished, & because they are inexpensive, you don't mind reaching for a new one when the bristles do start to wear. Only downside is that a stray bristle fiber does occasionally go rogue & sticks out from the pack; i just trim those off & keep going.",
