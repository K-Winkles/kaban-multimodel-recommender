                "reviewText": "If my wife were to mention one of the \"quirky\" things about me, she'll say that I always have to try the latest & greatest toothbrushes. I've tried dozens of toothbrushes over the years and unlike some people, I don't skimp on them because what you pay is what you get in terms of tooth-brushing.If you've never tried a toothbrush that costs over $2, I suggest you give them a try. You'll be surprised how well it cleans not only the main surface of your teeth, but between them and in areas you can't reach with a generic toothbrush.With this particular toothbrush (I got the medium bristle), I'm able to get a clean feeling all over my teeth. YOu know when you run your tongue over your teeth, you feel that grimy plaque? Not so with this toothbrush. It's almost as good as going to the dentist. The multi-angle bristles really do get down in all the cracks & crevices between your teeth. The head \"flexes\" a little bit (I assume this is to keep the pressure off your gums) and the grip is great. Also, I'm SUPER SUPER glad that this toothbrush doesn't have a broad base. This is a HUGE problem for me when putting my toothbrush in the toothbrush holder. Some toothbrushes (like some Colgates) have a base thicker than a drumstick, so I'm not able to put the toothbrush in my holder. Not so with this one.Oh and to save a bit of cash, clip a coupon on Amazon (if available) and use subscribe & save. I did and the 2-pack only cost me $4.68. :)",

                "reviewText": "Oral-B has been a leader in toothbrush design for some years, but I was always skeptical about an \"advanced\" toothbrush being any more useful than a regular old toothbrush and a little bit of elbow-grease. Well, I'm now a believer!The design of this brush head is configured in such a way that no matter which way you are brushing, there is always a bristle scrubbing, rubbing, massaging, or penetrating those hard to reach areas in your mouth. The first time I used this brush, my teeth felt foreign to me afterwards, as if I had just removed braces (but without the slimy feel). I have fairly nice teeth, but this brush actually does a pretty good job of cleaning your pearly whites.The head is on a flexible float-like pivot. I assume this allows it to conform to your mouth and reach those hard to reach places, regardless how you have your hand oriented. Often, at least according to my dentist, people hold on the front bristles against their teeth and fail to really get in-between their teeth with the bristles, where most of the food and gunk resides. This brush pretty much takes care of that. I'm not saying this is the best brush out there - but as far as brushes I've tested, this is now my new favorite until I find one that can do what this one can, plus some.One additional note - I purchased this pack because it is recommended to change our your toothbrush every 3 months - so with Amazon Subscribe and Save, I have a set of two (two members in house) sent to me every three months. Great way to ensure you always have a clean toothbrush ready to go and not put something teeming with bacteria in your mouth.",

The flexible head doesn't seem to me to do anything different than a regular toothbrush, but in spite of that I really like the toothbrush. I like the full head and semi firm bristles. It does a good job of cleaning my teeth; so much so I ordered my second batch of two toothbrushes today after two + months of usage.As far as the comments about paste and dirt getting caught under the flexible part; I just checked mine after 2+ months of usage and see no dirt, mold or paste under it at all. the plastic under it that holds the center set of bristles is just naturally dark, not dirty. I scrapped a pin against it to see if anything comes off and it doesn't....it's just the color of the base the bristles are stuck into. Maybe some of those people that complained have an unusually high moisture content in their bathrooms causing mold...who knows? All I know is that my toothbrushes are fine. I'd buy them again a third time. I also have to admit...the $1.50 discount coupon that was attached to the Amazon ad helped in me selecting them for a second time.",
