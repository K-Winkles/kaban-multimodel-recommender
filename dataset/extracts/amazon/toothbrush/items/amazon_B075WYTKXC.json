                "reviewText": "After I turned fifty, I realized either the bristles of the toothbrushes my dentist gives me had gotten more aggressive or my gums were becoming a lot more sensitive. Extra soft toothbrushes are as hard to source in stores as unicorn tears. If you do find one, it'll probably cost you $8. Amazon to the rescue, as always. These toothbrushes are phenomenal! My teeth feel just as clean as they did when I brushed with the ubiquitous soft-bristle models, but my gums never hurt or bleed anymore. I've been using these ones (one at work, one at home) for a few weeks now, too, and the bristles seem to be holding their shape well. The price was nice, too. For the price of a single brush at a chain retailer, I got four. Color me impressed!",
