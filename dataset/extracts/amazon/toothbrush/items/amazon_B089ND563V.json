                "reviewText": "My son initially bought these and gave some to everyone in the family. It took me a while to actually try them, because due to a mistake in shopping lists, my husband bought an enormous quantity of plastic toothbrushes a few years ago, and we still have most of them. However, as I've been reducing my plastic usage, I decided that I'd try these to see how they would work as a long-term replacement. Perhaps it was a mistake to do that, since I greatly prefer them and now can't go back. I guess I'll donate all of the unused plastic ones.These are soft and gentle on the gums and dentin. However, when I clean my tongue with them, they angle in exactly the right way to form a scraper of sorts, which is very effective at cleaning my tongue without irritating it. That's important because traditional tongue scrapers (both plastic and metal ones) are too harsh on my poor tongue.I can't say that I've ever had a strong preference about the shape of my toothbrush handles, but this one works just fine and feels good in my hand. I like that it uses minimal material, without all the wasteful curves and thick spots that many toothbrushes have (and that have never done anything for me). So, basically, I like everything about this toothbrush, particularly that it won't be polluting the environment a thousand years from now. Well done, Nuduko!",

                "reviewText": "I love that these use bamboo instead of crappy plastic. The brush part is not biodegradable but at least the main part of the brush, the handle, is environmentally friendly. These took a bit of getting used to at first because I was so used to the crappy plastic ones, but I've been using these bamboo ones for years now and I love them, could never go back. They are medium in strength I would say, so I have to be careful to not add too much pressure when brushing. I would love a softer version too, I would alternate.",
