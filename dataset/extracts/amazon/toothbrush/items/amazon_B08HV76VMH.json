It's truly unlike any normal brush. I've used the traditional type, electric, and Sonicare. These are just a whole different experience. They're pretty inexpensive, so if you're contemplating, just get them.I love them so much I gave one to my bf and he also approves!",

Pressing hard doesn\u2019t made it dig into the crevices of my mouth or collapse. It\u2019s not a soft toothbrush that flattens and it\u2019s not a flosstip that painfully pokes into every space.I was also worried about it holding water. It doesn\u2019t seem to stay that much wetter than other toothbrushes I\u2019ve had as long as I flick the water out of the bristles.The head is very small which also makes it more comfortable to get into the far spaces of my mouth.I really recommend for sensitive mouths and sensory problems. It\u2019s way easier to start brushing again with this than with any other brush, whether I stopped because I was gagging from the sensory overload or because it was painful.",

                "reviewText": "I have mixed feelings about this toothbrush. I love the supremely soft bristles, and I feel like it gently but efficiently polishes the surface of my teeth. However, after a few weeks of use, the bristles seem to get even softer (if that's possible) and stop scrubbing as much in btwn the teeth/the crevices where the gums meet the inside of the teeth. It's still working sufficiently but def. don't skip flossing with this brush!The one thing I hate about this toothbrush is that the handle area, tho covered in a rubbery material, is too slick, and slips around when it gets wet (as a toothbrush handle is want to during the brushing of teeth). The toothpaste/saliva/water that drips down the toothbrush makes the area slick, and I find myself gripping extra hard and repositioning the brush to get the correct angles for the insides of the back molars. I hope they fix this design flaw.I have not observed any molding issue with my toothbrush, it seems to air out fully in btwn 2x daily brushings, and even on the occasions when I brush my teeth 3x in a day.",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely so happy to buy these toothbrushes. I just ordered my 2nd box. So soft & they reach all the areas my old brushes couldn't get. I was getting so annoyed buying all the other brands labeled extra soft & finding that after a few uses they seem to become course or the bristles start shedding. These are awesome & cost less than most of the other brands.",

                "reviewText": "After trying so many different whitening products that didn't work it occurred to me maybe it wasn't the toothpaste that was the problem but the toothbrush. With a little research I found a study about the cleaning ability of a 20,000 bristle toothbrush.The bristles are so soft that I can scrub hard around the gum line without any bleed. The bristles are so strong that they are not damaged by vigorous cleaning. The individual bristles are so fine that they fit in between teeth spaces were even floss can't go.I can hear the squeak of clean, feel the smoothness on the surface of my teeth, and see a visible difference as the yellow tarnish disappears to reveal a much whiter smile.",
