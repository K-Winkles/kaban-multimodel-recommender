I read in other reviews before purchase that some people were having issues with getting blisters on the ankles, but I have not had this experience with these shoes. I also think there is plenty of room in the toe box, so my toes don\u2019t rub on the sides during walking or workouts. Overall, I\u2019m very happy with my purchase!",

It did take a couple of weeks of daily use to break then in, and I'm referring to the heel or pull tab at the rear. They dug and rubbed into the Achilles area where the skin blistered and bled on the first day. I usually wear low ankle socks so the skin was exposed when it happened. Switched to ankle socks for a couple of weeks to create a barrier while the heel tab stretched outwards where it no longer rubbed against the back of the skin. Once done, I was able to go back to wearing low cut socks as seen in my pictures.",

She said the shoes felt different. More specifically, the foam cushioning was much less dense than her other pair of New Balance fresh foam sneakers. My wife is a larger woman (200+lbs) so that could\u2019ve very easily played a factor in this determination. She said she felt like her feet \u201cfell through\u201d the foam and that the shoes also caused her to feel as if her feet were rolling inward at the heel. All in all, they are cute shoes and would go with just about anything just probably not the best for larger women.",

I usually wear a size ten so I ordered a 10.5 wide this time for toe room and I'm so glad I did. The platform is nice and thick and squishy for when you land on your heel, this is going to make cardio much more pleasant",
