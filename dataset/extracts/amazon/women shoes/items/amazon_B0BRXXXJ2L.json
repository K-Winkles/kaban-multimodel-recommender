To really blend with my skin I need a slightly pink shoe, so this was perfect!I\u2019m usually a 7 or 7.5 and a 7 fits me perfectly. I did get a rub on the heel and it\u2019s slightly uncomfortable on the bone under my pinky toe (the knuckles of the foot, one might say) but it\u2019s nothing unexpected for a fancy looking shoe. They look a bit pinker in real life than they appear in my pictures so I took one next to a nude shoe to show the difference.I wore them to a wedding and outdoor reception and there are no scuff marks yet! Overall I am very happy.",
