                "reviewText": "Fit is perfect, just not with socks. Feels like it was designed to be worn that way. Easy on the skin , no chafing or binding anywhere. The leather is not thick but is still sturdy. I bought these to replace a pair of Skechers I had been using for dog-walking. I have two large Coonhounds who give me a serious run for my money on a 45-minute haul around the local WalMart Supercenter and beyond every morning. The only shoe that had been working for me was the Skecher Elston lace-up with special traction soles. Every other shoe I tried ended me up on my butt on the ground whenever the two beasts tried to charge a stray animal they saw as prey. The dogs have a fairly low center of gravity, so when the two of them gear up their hind legs at the same time to charge, the resulting pulling force is truly overwhelming, so much so that I have had to wear a leather cycling glove on the hand that holds their leashes. A shoe with a special traction sole was the only one that kept me upright when this all happened. Problem with the Skechers was the sole would work loose from the toe edge, and the lace-up would come loose from the pull of the dogs. The Clarks have small zippers to snug them up so I thought this would stop the lace loosening problem. It has, and the shoes work well on the walk. I was a little concerned about not wearing socks but this has not made any difference, other than to keep me cooler in the hot Florida weather. The construction of the join between the leather upper and the sole of the Clarks is much stronger than the one on the Skechers, the latter being glued together, whereas on the Clarks it's sewn with what appears to be substantial threading. So I do not expect a problem with the sole tearing up as it did with the Skechers. So far, traction with the Clarks is acceptable, however I will update the review in future if the two hounds succeed in dumping me again.",

I tend to supinate and this causes pain if the toe of the shoe turns inward causing my foot to roll ourward. I guess those 'toe-in' shoes are great for pronators, but not me. This Clark's shoe has a straighter last and corrects my problem perfectly. I have bought other Clark's shoes and they also are perfect. Construction is high quality, leather and soft insole. I will never even consider another brand.",

I have worn them for full days at work, and I like the style and bottom feet comfort. I am hoping that they loosen up a bit so they aren\u2019t so tight.Overall good shoe.

The sole is closer to a normal or standard wide. Really closer to normal. There is more space in the shoe for fat feet. So if you are just fat but don't really have a wide bone structure, these might do for you. They were too narrow to accommodate my wide foot and allow for natural foot spread. At the same time, I could easily slide two whole fingers in the shoe above my foot. I'm so disappointed. Not really in the shoe quality, but the creator's interpretation of what is a wide shoe. Maybe there needs to be another category for chunky or fat feet that is different than wide. It would be really nice if shoe companies would have printable pdf file drawing of the insoles so we could easily see if our foot fits.",
