They look nice, have just the right sized heel and are very comfortable to be in all day, standing and walking. I did get a small blister the first time I wore them because I wore them all day and walked a lot without breaking them in, etc. I wore them with the no show nylon type things so didn't really have any protection between my skin and the shoe in the side/heel area. After that, no issues at all. Great purchase.",
