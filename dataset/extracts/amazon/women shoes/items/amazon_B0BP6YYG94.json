                "reviewText": "Have been looking for a pair of comfortable loafers for a long time now. Ordered several recognizable brands but had to return them. As soon as I tried them on, I had issues with them. Most were not comfortable, or the back would slip off as I tried to walk. I found these on Amazon and based on the verified reviews, I took a chance. I\u2019m glad I did! As soon as I put them on and took a step, my foot didn\u2019t slip off and my feet had plenty of room. They are soft and super comfortable. The best part, I saw that the insoles were removable and that was a huge plus for me! Since I have many issues with my feet, I immediately ordered a pair of Vionic Relief Insoles and switched them out! I am 8 1/2 in open shoes but based on the reviews, I ordered 8 1/2 and these loafers are perfect. The insoles that worked for me were the small size. I love these loafers so much that I just ordered a pair of black and blue ones. Since I stand on my feet and do a lot of walking at work, I know that these shoes will be my go to pair! The best thing is that they were 20 percent off! I plan on getting the red ones too! I will just switch my Vionic insoles into the pair I decide to wear! If you are wondering, the insoles do not make these shoes tighter in the contrary super comfy! If you are on fence about grabbing a pair, don\u2019t hesitate. I included pictures of the insoles these come with and the ones I plan on using for extra support!",

I also doubt they are leather as mentioned in the description. Overall I\u2019m happy with the purchase for the price.",

It matches my Patrica Nash handbag perfectly. The question is whether the shoe is leather. I am not sure. The inside is beautifully lined, the out side material is soft just like the video shows. Sole is flexible. I wear a size 8.5 For me the shoe is a perfect fit, just wide enough to accommodate a pair of socks, but l can also wear them without a sock and the heel does not slip. No rubbing, no pain, no break in period. Best pair of shoes l purchase in a long time. If they\u2019re not leather l will trade that for comfort. Would l buy them again, absolutely plan on getting a second pair after the Holidays.",
