I get compliments every time I wear them!Interestingly, this \u201cCabaret\u201d style runs narrower than the similar \u201cDarcy\u201d fringed style\u2026 not sure why, but it was a welcome surprise for my narrow-ish feet. These fit perfectly! I also found that both styles run large\u2026 I normally wear an 11 but 10 works great for these.",

I wanted something different for Fall in Urban Toronto & I'm hoping these will work. Also I can see where they can be dressed up or down...nice bonus.",
