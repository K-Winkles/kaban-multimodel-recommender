Jacob's love of music and dancing took him to the local ballet schools and at one of these schools he noticed a young dancer struggling to stay en pointe. Jacob promised he would make her a better pair of pointe shoes to dance in, and so he did. Jacob\u2019s reputation for making high-quality dance footwear spread rapidly. Jacob\u2019s shoes became so well-known and sought after, that it sparked the creation of a full range of dance footwear and dance fashion products. The brand grew rapidly and over time became the BLOCH we know and love. Today, BLOCH has a reputation as one of the most trusted in the industry and is still fulfilling the promise made by its founder close to nine decades ago; \"to make the most comfortable dance shoe in the world\".",

It is perfect for dance floors and even on carpet!! The fit is very nice and I love the stretchy elastics around the arch instead of the ones with strings that you have to tie.One thing about this product, these shoes run larger than expected. I got them a size smaller than my street shoe size so make sure to order many sizes and try them out!!But these shoes will not slip off your feet and improved my turns a LOT! It has cushioning on the bottom and supports your feet very nicely.I was wearing these shoes while writing this review but it felt so comfortable, they're almost like supportive socks!!! So if you want good ballet shoes, get these NOW!!!",

I have to remove them and sew on new ones. That's worth it to me because these are the best shoes for me. Just know that if you have a high arch, the elastics may be too tight for you.

                "reviewText": "I like this shoe a lot. No round elastic channel makes them a bit more comfortable but they feel more traditional than shoes with very elastic panels etc. They look polished and nice. I\u2019m not a huge fan of the fact that the ankle elastic is pre-sewn BUT it hasn\u2019t caused me any pain and I don\u2019t feel a need to rip out the sturdy machine seam to move the elastic only slightly.Okay so fit. I wear a 7 women\u2019s shoe. Since gaining some weight, by high arch foot has been uncomfortable in many shoes and I often size up to an 8 or even an 8.5 just to have less pressure over the top of my foot even if the 8 is too long.I have always found ballet shoes in the equivalent of a 7 a little bit restrictive for spreading my toes. I have tapered greek toes (Morton\u2019s toe), and the ball of my foot is the widest part of my foot. So, wide greek feet. I often feel like I\u2019m either on my big toe only or on my other toes only on rel\u00e8ve. I sized up to a 6 instead of a 5 in these because my toes need a lot of room to work!The sizing up may have also saved me from having issues with the pre-sewn elastic given my fat feet. The elastic is just very slightly tighter than I would have sewn it myself.The \u201ccanvas\u201d stretches most perpendicular to the lines in the fabric, so diagonally across the top of the foot. I attached a picture showing the fabric for clarity. This material stretches just a little bit in all directions but is not at all some totally stretchy spandex or something. It still feels mostly rigid, but is softer and thinner than many canvas shoes I have had, so I expect they will be a little less durable. The diagonal stretch of the fabric is perfect for giving my toes room to spread.The pleats are not bothersome at all with this thinner fabric. The leather pad on the ball of the foot feels a little farther back than in my Sanshas and Capezios, but this could be because I sized up. In any case, it is in a perfectly fine place.I really like these shoes and find them a nice change from really rigid canvas without feeling or looking like a hybrid shoe. The elastic around the top is more comfortable than raw string elastic as less obviously different than other types. If you want a more modern shoe without a modern look (or if your teacher abhors a hybrid shoe look!) these might be a good buy for you. I find them mostly flattering, although the pre-sewn elastic is a drawback to look and feel. Would be 5 stars if the elastic was not pre-sewn, or even if it had an inch of extra so it could be let out and sewn longer.",

The slit padding did have a slightly slidy traction, but still grippy enough not slide around.I have a slight bunion on one foot so I wanted to find a slipper that didn't feel like it was making it worse. This had good shape with some space for my toes, but wasn't too much excess fabric.SIZE: I went according to the size chart picture they had above the product description. I measured about 9.4\" long, so about 38-39 EU size, then according to that EU size on their size chart picture, I went with EU 39, which was a 6 for Bloch. 6wide is good for me (bc bunion).I'll keep this one and return the others.",

Elastic is noticeably snug without being uncomfortable.

The color is beautiful and my arch is pronounced in these. I am able to plie and turn with quickness, have a lot of stability in the shoes, and they don\u2019t hurt my feet at all. It feels like I\u2019m not even really wearing anything on my feet which really helps since ballet is so tiresome on the feet. These are great for beginners such as myself and for dancers who are seasoned and need something simple for practice. 10/10 would buy again!",
