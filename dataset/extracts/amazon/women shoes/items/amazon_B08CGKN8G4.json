I wear a 7.5 always in a tennis shoe so thats what I ordered. Way too small. So I ordered a 8 and again, way too small. So I am still going to order them again in a 8.5. My suggestion is to start with a full size larger than you wear. I will let you know how they wear when I get to try them. I would not go to this trouble if I did'nt like them so much! Tried the 3rd pair for the length but the width is too large and doesn't give enough support.. I'm so disappointed!",

It seems like shoes these days really wear out in the tread quickly while these Saucony's tend to last longer. They are comfortable. I'm not necessarily jazzed about the look of the shoe, but I love to jog in them. The only problem I tend to have with them is that the heel can get a hole in the inside. Full disclosure though, I am an adult who struggles with finding the motivation to untie her shoes all of the time. For my latest pair I am taking the time to do so, and they are seeming to hold up better.",

I did a half and then the following week a. 10k I made the school girl error of buying late as I went for other brands so didn\u2019t have time to bed these in. On the half marathon I wore socks and blister plasters where I thought I may get rub. Had nothing. They\u2019re comfy and I felt safe and they\u2019re not tight fitting. As a 4.5 I went one size uk and they\u2019re perfect.",
