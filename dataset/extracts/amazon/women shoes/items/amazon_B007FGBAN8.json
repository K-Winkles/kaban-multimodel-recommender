Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn\u2019t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I\u2019m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That\u2019s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it.",

I read the reviews about the non slip part. It was like 50-50. At times the shoes aren\u2019t as non slip as other shoes I\u2019ve had. Or there\u2019s times where it\u2019s not non slip at all and I almost fall. It\u2019s a 50-50. UPDATE:: the more I wear them the more slippery they are. Also the shoe laces come undone like every 5 minutes.. gonna need different shoes but these will do until my new ones come.",

Falling hard, and hurting my right shoulder and lower back/hip. I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again.",

                "reviewText": "I recently got hired to work for the USPS as a City Carrier Assistant (CCA), but searching for the right shoes for the job was going to be quite challenging since everyone has different opinions about what they believe to be the most comfortable shoes. I researched a lot of options and narrowed it down to price range, and comfort for my size 6 feet \ud83e\uddb6\ud83c\udffc. I am 5\u20192 and Weigh about 130lbs. My jobs requires miles of walking about an average of 9-12 hours on my feet. I have to say that I have out walked the seasoned mail carriers because of these shoes. You have to break these in in order for them to conform to your feet. It took me about 3-4 times wearing them to break them in. They are so comfortable that I forget that I am wearing them. They are affordable and are NOT Postal Approved shoes. (This was a conscience decision by me) however they meet the uniform requirements,(all black leather). I really love these shoes. They are not the prettiest to look at, but it\u2019s not a fashion shoes. They are great work shoes!!",

As a matter of fact I had to add airsoles for them to feel comfortable. They also look kinda cheap looking. My pants are long so it's not noticeable. I kept this pair, as I needed asap, and I will keep them as an SOS. I don't plan on buying these again. Better to go in the store and look.",
