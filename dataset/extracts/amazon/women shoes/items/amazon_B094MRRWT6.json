                "reviewText": "Update on Ricochet; A good shoe, but it never really matches the springy yet structured lightness and the glove like fit of the Tempo. I returned it and buying another Tempo. It will discontinue in favor of the new Tempo which is different.Adrenaline GTS is the guardrail version of Ghosts (which I wore for years until they felt heavy). I had a couple of bad falls forward in the Adrenaline GTS; the second landed me in ER followed by physical therapy and dental work. Dangerous at any age, more so at 69. I didn't connect feeling like I was leaning forward in them to the falls, since they were quite comfortable. No falls in the Ghosts. Both have a 12mm midsole drop, are cushiony, and in the 10 oz range.I bought the Hyperion Tempo, which I love followed by Ricochets. The Tempo is super light and the shape is darn near perfect for my feet. Both Tempo and Ricochet have an 8mm midsole drop. With 4mm subtracted, the major difference is that my hips/center of gravity are straight over my feet, no correcting for leaning forward, and I can strike from the midsole, not the heel. Physical therapy corrected my balance, posture and gait, but these sneakers are a definite improvement. I'm a fast road walker who used to run before the falls. Now I feel more confident to speed up without foot drag or tripping. Midsole drop, weight and less cushioning make a big difference for me.I've walked in the Tempo four times so far but not yet in the Ricochet. The Tempo is springy and fast, cushion a bit harder than I'm used to, at first. But they softened up nicely after 2-3 wears and feel cushiony enough for me now. Ricochet's pretty much the same. I'm keeping both.Fit: with socks and for width, I'm an 11.5B. I have to wear socks with some compression (type 2 diabetes). I have narrow heels but wide metatarsals/ball width, with my second toe being the longest, and the Brooks last fits my foot shape well. (In comparison, Nikes lead to hip and knee pain after a month.) I've done Try before Buying at least 12 pairs of Brooks in sizes 11-11.5B or wide widths when available. I can't recommend it enough, because I find different Books models vary in size and width, even in the same model; consistency is a problem. Worst example: Trace 2's 11W is narrower (and feels shorter) than its 11M. Also tried Launch, Revel, newer Ghost, others. The Hyperion Tempo was an instant love, though I had to size up a half size. My feet have never felt so light yet still supported.Tempo's toe box is generous with tiny slits to accommodate more height. Ricochet also has a generous toebox, both are good for my longer second toe. And the heels are nice and snug. Hyperion Tempo's upper seems molded. Ricochet upper is knit yet stiffer/thicker. Both model tongues are long and nicely thin. With both Hyperion and Ricochet, I'm only tightening the top/second lace to accommodate my width, but still get good arch and side to side support.Hyperion pet peeves is the laces. They're thin but have these...things? notches?...sticking from each side. Harder to unlace.The standout feature in the Tempo for me is its more generous width/fit and incredibly light, well fitting upper that somehow stills gives great support. I got drenched in the rain and soaked through my socks. But I didn't feel squishy or uncomfortable, and the Tempos dry out quick.Price: Great discount on the Tempo both here and mfr. website. I just wish Amazon sellers featured that Brooks Run Happy guarantee.Style/vibe: I love the happy, fizzy Tempo colorway, even in black. Compared to it the Ricochet is funereal (but that color was 60% cheaper, so no complaints). But it's nice to have two different vibes. The important thing is the fit.",

Brooks come up small anyway my general foot size is a 5 in most shops, something to think of when you do take the plunge with Brooks.Overall I am very happy with them, I run 6 days a week, due to injury I am only on treadmill lately so I cant comment on hard surface runs in these but Ghosts are fab on the road, Hyperion have less grip so if you do run on the road avoid wet conditions I wouldn't trust the grip.Laces are unusual on the Tempos very stretchy which is fab for getting them snug but could be a potential weak point further down the road.Id give them a solid 8/10",
