                "reviewText": "Update after three months: These shoes do not have the arch support needed and lack the cushioning needed to run around on a court. I have never had foot pain until wearing this shoe. When I wear this my feet hurt and cramp. I have purchased three different arch supports and inserts to try to make this shoe comfortable and work for me but to no avail. I will need to purchase a different brand. I am so disappointed that I wasted money on these. They are attractive but not functional for court play. Remember that you only have two feet take good care of them and wear what actually works and protects them.Previous review: I bought the ASIC Gel Dedicated 7 for Pickleball and find that it is a good sturdy shoe with good support. It is not as flexible in the toe bed as I think it should be and the toe bed is longer and wider than I expected! I could have gone for a half size smaller but had never used a tennis shoe before so I wasn\u2019t sure how much toe space was needed to run around the court. I do like this shoe and would have loved it a half size smaller. It is balanced but does pitch your heels down some so I feel like my heels are stuck to the floor. I have to mentally remind myself to tilt forward slightly onto the ball of my feet so that I can be more responsive to the on-court action. I mostly wear running shoes so I am more comfortable in the forward toe pitch of those. Overall, this shoe works for my Pickleball game, I feel secure and safe, and my feet are happy.",
