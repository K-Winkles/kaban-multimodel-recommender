Glad I ordered 0.5 size smaller--good fit as is.Material cloth not leather and sole comfortable, but thin. Materials not meant to last or endure. Shoe hardly noticeable on feet--think more like sturdy sock. More warm temps, house or office desk shoe not for walking/hike--even a little! Feels like a (lasting) one-summer/comfortable near daily wear kind-of-flat.Pleased w purchase as this is what I had looked for and it fits the bill for the current price.",

                "reviewText": "I have a number of foot issues so I need to \"customize my shoes\" , these worked great. They are now extremely comfortable, supportive, and attractive. Here's how: I have one foot that is a size 12 and the other is 13., and consequently some mild bunion issues. One of my legs is a bit shorter than the others so I need a stable shoe. I hate orthopedic shoes, and they are ridiculously expensive.I have learned to solve these issues by finding a couple different types of shoe inserts that are comfortable, have a good arch support, and are cushy. I like memory foam and I have one heavenly set of fleece inserts. I have a couple of thin insoles and a few sets of thicker ones. Be careful not to get the insert too thick or there will be no room for your heel. These shoes are deep enough I can even use my fleece inserts. Always get the shoe to fit the large foot, in my case I bought the 13s, they are true to size.I custom fit shoes with cotton wool (a real cotton ball pulled apart and shaped as needed) in the toe of the shoe that is too long. I use heel pads on the back of the heels, usually silicone for a snug fit and to prevent slipping, although a little hair spray works well for that too. Then add the insert of my choice and voila!If necessary, I tuck little cotton wool tucked into strategic places to relieve pressure points and the shoes fit like a glove.I know it sounds like a lot of bother, but the insoles are interchangeable from shoe to shoe and I just leave the heel pads and cotton in the toe until it needs changing. It only takes a few minutes to custom fit them and I can wear them all day. It is not very costly, so I can have several pairs of cute inexpensive shoes that fit and support as well as the expensive ones.Hope this helps someone.",

                "reviewText": "I don't do heels anymore, not since quarantine, and I usually wear the Belice flats (also from Amazon). However, I wanted something a bit more unique to wear to work, and I think these fit the bill. They sort of look like pointe shoes with the square toe, which I think is more stylish than the regular round-toed flats.I usually wear a size 9, but had to size down to an 8.5 in these because they were too long and kept slipping off of my feet. Once I had the right size, there was no break-in period at all and no blistering-- they just fit. This is not true of all Amazon flats-- the pointy-toed loafers and the pointed flats both gave me horrible blisters-- but both these and the Belice version are great.The material is some sort of microsuede situation. I wouldn't want to get them wet, but it doesn't show much wear so far.As with most cheap flats, the sole will eventually start peeling, but I usually get maybe half a year of near-constant wear out of these, so the price per wear is really not bad. I will likely buy another pair when these wear out.",

I can tell they won't last long because of the construction, but I'm ok with it considering how stylish and comfortable they are. I did size down like the other reviews recommended and they fit perfectly.",
