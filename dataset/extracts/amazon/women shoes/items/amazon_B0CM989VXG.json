                "reviewText": "I am not one that wears flats at all. I live in Crocs because they are easy to keep clean. With the colder weather, I need something to cover my toes due to a medical condition from chemotherapy. I was very impressed with how these shoes arrived. These arrived in a shoe box with a nice shoe sleeve over each shoe. They also had a a card inside that if you have any issues with the shoes, to contact them and they would attempt to help you. Comfort wise, again, someone who never liked to wear flats, these are amazing! I did not feel there was a heel on them at all compared to another flat shoe I have. My feet feel very close to the ground, and I feel I have a stable walk in these which I need. They keep my toes warm, and the heel is very comfortable. What I like about the heel, there is a padding in it that is why it is raised a bit in the back. I tried to walk and move my feet several ways to get them to irritate my foot, but they never did. They are well padded shoes! I am so happy I decided to get these. I also want to add I was on the fence on size. I usually wear a 7 but lately a lot of shoes are too small or wide, but I decided to go for the 7 and am so happy I did. These fit perfectly! I am very happy with these. Comfort all the way!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these in Navy in size 9. They are true to size and relatively comfortable for my wider foot. I like that they have the very slightest amount of a heel so I don't feel flat footed wearing them. They have a good amount of cushion on the sole and a slight cushion on the heel so they do not rub and they stay on your feet. I also like how high the top comes up over my toes so that it does not show toe \"cleavage\".If I find myself needing another pair of ballet flats in a different color, I would definitely order these again.",

                "reviewText": "I was excited about these ballet flats, especially for their acclaimed comfort features. The 3D insole, with its breathable fabric and memory foam, truly lives up to its promise, offering unparalleled comfort underfoot. The enhanced arch support and U-shaped heel cup are great for foot pressure relief, and the breathable lining alongside the padded collar adds to the overall comfort, preventing any heel slippage.However, there's a downside\u2014the back of the shoe is too high for my liking, causing discomfort against the back of my foot, particularly the bone. This design flaw is a letdown, especially given the otherwise excellent features of these flats, such as the anti-slip outsole that provides both grip and flexibility for easy walking.Despite this issue, the flats exude timeless elegance, making them a versatile choice for various occasions. With a slight modification to the back, they would be perfect. For now, they remain a stylish, albeit slightly flawed, addition to my wardrobe.",

I'm going to try to put in another insole, a heel grip as well as wear them with heavier socks. Despite my mistake, I can feel how comfortable these Dream Pairs, are. The stitching is secure and well done. The sole is sturdy, a good height and shape. They are attractive with a simple, classic look. Even the inside, foot bed is attractive and feels so good. They would be suitable for skirts, pants, dressy or casual. They deserve 5 stars; the mistake in size was my own. Don't second guess; order your regular size.",

No pinching at the toes, length is perfect and the sole is so comfortable.My problem comes with the band that runs around the top of the shoe. It digs in at the top of the heel and digs in just in front of the ankle on the inside. If these shoes loosen up a bit as you wear them or if the band can be stretched with a little bit of heat they will be perfect. If not, they will be unwearable. In short, if they can't be broken in, the shape of your foot will determine comfort level.",
