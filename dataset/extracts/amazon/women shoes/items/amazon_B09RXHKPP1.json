I found these, read the reviews, and decided to purchase. When they arrived, they exceeded my expectations. I was so shocked at how classy and expensive they looked. I tried them on immediately and was blown away. They look so classy and way more expensive than I paid for them. I've seen others on Amazon, but none of them compare to these. I am pleased with my purchase!I am a size 7.5 and purchased my usual size. They fit well with a little room so they are comfortable and not too tight on my feet. I will not be walking long distances in these, so I can't say if they are good walking shoes. For me, they are perfect for the office and in and out of transportation to my destination.I can't wait to wear them!",

                "reviewText": "The shoes looked better in person than I expected. Style was great, especially the crocodile design that I chose. However, the fit was a bit tight and stiff (more than my usual new shoes). Hopefully they'll \"soften\" with regular wear. I think the size was quite accurate but definitely only for walking and office wear. They easily slip off if you try to run in them. My right shoe had a weird buldge (from where the buckle was attached) that hurt my foot but I was able to flatten it enough to make it less irritating. Overall, nice shoes for office if you don't like wearing heels.UPDATE: the faux leather has a very bad smell after a few times wearing it; mix in some feet sweat and it is awful. I've tried different sprays but it's the leather so not sure if it can be saved if it starts to get stinky. So disappointing.",
