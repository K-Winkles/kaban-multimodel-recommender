But these shoes even though they were \u201cwide\u201d were so narrow I couldn\u2019t even get them on my feet! I was so disappointed because they are so cute! I\u2019ll just stick with the loafers and boots I have, but it would be great if Clark\u2019s could make a truly wide shoe like this.",

The size 12 feels like it's a 1/2 size too large and absolutely kills my feet due to rubbing on the back of my heel. If you are fortunate enough to have a perfect fit, I suspect these shoes will be great. If they have a little breathing room for your toes, send them back because you'll be lucky to be able to wear them for even a few hours due to the heel slipping and rubbing. I find that the slightly smaller 11W is more comfortable since it is not rubbing the skin off of my heel (despite the fact that my toes are crunched). I'm still trying to figure out if I can place mole skin on the back of the size 12 so I can get some use out of them or if I should just donate them. Seriously disappointed...",
