However, I have been wearing them a few days and they're stretching out so now they are no longer uncomfortable. I really like the style - I wear them to work, they are comfortable to walk in, have a low heel so look nice but zero strain. The strappy design with the buckle is very cute. I've ordered LifeStride before and the quality is fine. They are all man-made materials, so won't last the same as leather, but I know that I'll get a decent amount of use from them. I would recommend them.",

I love the color and details. They feel solid and have good grip when walking.They can be worn with jeans or skirts, very versatile. Wear a lightweight sock or tights to avoid chaffing or blisters on your ankle as the heel is a bit stiff.Overall, I am very pleased with these and would recommend them!",

There was minimal break in time - these were comfy from the getgo.The reason these only get three stars from me is: I got them in March, so I\u2019ve had them for less than a year (granted, these have been my main shoe most days) and I have already worn holes completely through the soles (I first noticed it about 4 months in on the heels, but now there\u2019s a hole in my toe box too that lets all the snow right in to my feet) and the tops of the toes are threadbare. I am an elementary school k-5 teacher, so I know I\u2019m hard on my shoes. I do a lot of kneeling down and so the toes got worn out in a way that most people don\u2019t wear out their shoes, so I\u2019m not too upset about that, but the soles giving out so soon was not okay!! I\u2019m way too broke to be buying a new pair of shoes every school year.",
