I brought a 10 and they fit good. My feet are skinny and flat. I\u2019m talking no arch. These flats are comfortable. And attention grabbing. The Red Bottom is everything! A co-worker thought they were the CL Brand. NOT! I\u2019ve worn them w/ slacks and jeans. The material of the shoe. I can\u2019t explain. Kinda suede-ish. None the less the studs are sparkly and secure. I have no doubt they\u2019ll last a long time.",

                "reviewText": "I normally wear a size 8, but I found it too long, so that pair was returned. I ordered a 7.5 instead, and while the length was good, the right shoe was a tad narrower than the left (see first photo), so was not as comfortable as the left. Unfortunately, my right foot is my wider foot, so I have a shoe stretcher in the right shoe right now.The first photo also shows the padded insole, which is a nice feature. However, there is no arch support, so I insert orthotics for added comfort.I chose this option because it has a little more heel than the other style, and I liked the gold trim on the heel (see second photo).I'm also including a third photo showing the black sole, since the description did not include this.Overall, I would recommend this pair because it's dressy and generally comfortable, but I'm deducting one star because of the narrower right shoe.",
