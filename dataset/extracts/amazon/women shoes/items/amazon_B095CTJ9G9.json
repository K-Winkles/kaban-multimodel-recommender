                "reviewText": "The shoe is great, the packaging of this pair was not. I had bought this shoe in a different color about a year ago. is a very soft leather, not a hard structured leather. It is comfortable right out of the box. They named this color \"Periscope\" which is why I never bought it. What the heck is \"Periscope\"? And the picture is confusing. After reading reviews, I realized it was a very dark brown. I was in need of a dark brown shoe, so I bought it when it went on sale. My only complaint was the shipping box. It was packaged inside a larger box that had other things I ordered. The individual box that the shoes came in was NOT the original shoe box, but a box that was printed that the original box was damaged in shipment and this was a replacement box. That was not the problem. The problem was that the shoes must have gotten crushed while in the original box. Because it's a soft, more unstructured leather, they were a bit smooshed, like they had been crushed a bit. I took them out of the box and put a shoe shaper insert in them overnight. Fortunately they bounced back into shape. Whoever put them in the replacement box never inspected the shoes to see if the shoes were affected by the original damaged box",
