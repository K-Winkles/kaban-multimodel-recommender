                "reviewText": "I do not have any other shoes with flat bottoms like this. I have high arches that ache badly if unsupported. I can\u2019t wear flats at all because of them. I\u2019ve never been able to wear this style of shoe before. I most often fit a size 8 or 7.5 depending on shoe style and manufacturer. After a lot of researching I heard great things about these so I ordered my typical size (8) when they were on sale. The size 8 were surprisingly too loose and too wide. I exchanged them for a half size down.The 7.5 size fits perfect! At first I wasn\u2019t used to the style and shape of the toe box but it wasn\u2019t uncomfortable or painful - I\u2019m just used to sneakers with larger toe boxes. My toes adjusted pretty quickly after several wears. I love these shoes! The support is better than I could\u2019ve imagined! I work as an elementary educator with concrete/hard tile floors and am on my feet nearly all day long. These shoes give my all the support my arches and back need. Plus they are more professional looking than my nice tennis shoes. I can dress them up or down with ease and this black style looks cute (for me) with low, ankle, or longer socks.I\u2019ve been looking for shoes like this for years and just figured I\u2019d never be able to find a pair that worked for me. Not the case anymore! I\u2019ve been wearing them almost daily for nearly 4 months now. These have become my daily shoes instead of my nice sneakers. They haven\u2019t torn on the sides or bottom, there\u2019s been no weird stretching out, no scratches on the top or sides (and I\u2019m rough on shoes), no blisters or rubbing at all and the support has stayed! I love the padding on the heel and ankle of this shoe. My feet don\u2019t feel sore after taking these off even after a long day. Even during some 12+ hour days of teaching followed by errands and church in the evenings afterward, the support is there and keeps me on my feet.So far I\u2019ve been able to wear these all week long teaching and during the weekend without the comfort or support fading. I\u2019m asking for another pair in a different color for Christmas! Hoping a different color/fabric will still feel and hold up the same way.If you\u2019ve struggled to find this style of shoe due to high arches or other support/comfort problems- these might be worth a try for you. I recommend purchasing when on sale if it\u2019s hard for you to pull the spending trigger on shoes more than $25 or so (like it is for me). For how popular these shoes are, $50.00 seems like a fantastic deal! Here\u2019s to happy, healthy, supported feet \ud83d\udc63.",

                "reviewText": "After buying two cheap variations of these shoes using Amazon Lens on a picture from one of my Pinterest boards, I finally got a decent hit. These shoes rock, be aware they are not intended to be worn with thicker socks, and to size up accordingly if you\u2019re going to wear them in the colder months. Had to return the first pair because of a manufacturing defect, but Amazon quickly rectified this and sent me a replacement pair. They are very comfortable and I receive many complements on them. I don\u2019t normally wear animal print anything, but make an exception for some snake prints, this one is warm, almost a soft pink and warm tan. Keep that in mind when you\u2019re looking to pair them with clothes, it\u2019s not *as* neutral as I\u2019d have hoped.I pair them with my wool jacket in the fall, with a pair of black cigarette trousers and a pop of solid color in whatever sock I\u2019m wearing paired with a neutral modern fit top. Comfort and style is my go-to these days, and I\u2019ve learned that in a business casual office, you can basically get away with wearing cozy clothes if they\u2019re attractive and presently neatly enough. Words to live by.I\u2019ve already passed alone the link to these shoes to half a dozen people and they\u2019re always pleased (and surprised) to hear they\u2019re Doctor Scholl\u2019s. 9/10, taking a point away because they appear to be designed not to be worn with socks or with very thin ones which might be a problem on longer treks.>>I want to be very clear, since it\u2019s mentioned on the next review screen, these are not shoes to work out in. They are a walking shoe at best, a fashion shoe at worst. Keep that in mind.",

Unfortunately, the toe box is a little narrow and doesn\u2019t accommodate the changes that have happened in my feet over the years, like bunions and hammer toes. I can\u2019t wear them if I plan on doing a lot of walking, but they look great with jeans if I only plan to wear them for a couple hours.",
