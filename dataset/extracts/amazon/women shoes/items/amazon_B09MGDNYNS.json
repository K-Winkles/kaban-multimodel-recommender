These are stylish and wear well without a 200-dollar price tag. I highly recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been wearing Brooks Anthem for the past year. I decided to try some new lines to see what I prefer.I wasn\u2019t ready to commit to a shoe I\u2019d never worn, so I used the Try Before You Buy option. Charm City Run is the seller that provided this for Prime members, and Amazon helped fulfill the orders.I ordered three pairs of shoes from Charm City Run: one Brooks Adrenaline GTS, an initial Brooks Trace 2, and I followed up with a second pair of Trace 2s.After comparing the Adrenaline GTS, Trace 2, and my Anthems, I greatly prefer the Trace 2.The Anthems are flat at the arch, with a springy midsole. Simple shoes that have treated me kindly, and I\u2019ve made a repeat purchase on. However, there are better shoes, so I\u2019ve learned.Adrenaline GTS (Go-To Support) didn\u2019t feel right. The arch was a knob under my foot, and they felt chunky on my feet. I opted to return these immediately.The Trace 2 felt like it aligned my foot how it was supposed to be for optimal posture. The cushioned midsole was superior to the Anthems I\u2019d previously been buying.With each pair of shoes, I do a squat test to see how my hips align. A shoe\u2019s structure will ultimately affect your foot posture, and up the chain to your knees, hips, back and so forth.With the Anthem and Adrenaline GTS, my right foot (previously fractured) was not in alignment, thus leading to poor hip flexion in the squat.When I donned the Trace 2, both of my feet felt great. The arch wasn\u2019t of simple design like a knob under my inner foot. There was metatarsal support which helped my toes splay in the roomy toe box, which was notably more spacious than the Anthem\u2019s.The heel cup cradled my hindfoot securely. I feel like my foot rests ON the heel cup of the Adrenaline GTS and Anthem, rather than resting IN the heel cup. Consequently, the fabric of my older pair of Anthems has worn at the heel area.When I squatted down in the Trace 2, my hip joint was aligned perfectly for even weight distribution on the descent, with proper femur positioning to allow maximal hip joint mobility. The ascent was stable and comfortable.After feeling the differences between the shoes, I purchased the Trace 2, and decided to try another pair in a different color. I ended up purchasing the second pair as well, and have received compliments on them.I definitely recommend these shoes, and I recommend Prime members to utilize Try Before You Buy. Charm City Run provided 3 new pairs of shoes in perfect condition. I ultimately returned one, and purchased two from them.",

                "reviewText": "I had been buying Brooks' ghost series but decided to try these much more affordable ones and find them actually more comfortable and not much different. These fit my narrow feet a little better and this particular color is great for matching with both black and dark blue. Even though they are technically black, the blue tinge of the lavender soles and swooshes actually makes them look navy blue overall. Still I wear them with pants of both colors and they look fine. They stay clean-looking a lot longer because of the darker colored soles!",
