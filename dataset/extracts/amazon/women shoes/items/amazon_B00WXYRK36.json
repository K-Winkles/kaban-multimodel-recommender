                "reviewText": "I was never crazy about her as a celebrity, but I continue to be a huge fan of the Jessica Simpson brand, especially the shoes. I fully intend to wear these until they're falling off, then order another pair.Fit: Perfect. I have normal-width feet that generally fit into a 9 or 9.5 in most shoes. I went with the 9.5 here, and it fits like a dream.Style: Couldn't be better. I purchased the taupe, which has maybe just slightly more grey than displayed, but it's still a warm and beautiful, year-round color. I especially like that the body of the shoe is a matte suede while the straps are a shiny satin. It's a nice texture variation and an extra nod to the design of a real ballet shoe.Pros:- insanely comfortable - those smooth satiny straps wrap securely around the ankle without choking or chafing- versatile - can't wait to wear these with basically everything in my wardrobe, to the office, out to dinner, sightseeing on vacation, everywhere- reasonably priced - well made and a total bargain for $39.99 in my opinionCons:- literally my only complaint is that even the lowest low-profile socks are a no-go (the sides of the shoe are just too shallow)Yes, you can see \"toe cleavage.\" Exposure of toe cleavage is not always faux pas, and in fact many upscale designers favor it for its subtle sexuality. If you're that worried about people seeing the cracks of your toes, then by all means avoid this shoe, but you're really missing out.",

I ordered my usual size and it is a tiny bit tight on top of my big toe and at the side of my pinky toe, but I think that will break in after a few wearings. Otherwise this shoe is so comfortable! There is some nice padding on the inner sole, and the outer sole is a thicker rubber than many flats have which also helps. The leather is pliable and hugs my foot, even at the top of the heel where shoes like this will often dig in. The elastic criss-cross straps are very comfortable, look so cute, and even give my foot a little extra support.My husband loves them and says it looks like someone took stripper heels and made them into a comfortable shoe. I think they look classier than that, but I figured I\u2019d toss in his opinion too. Haha.",

                "reviewText": "I really love these adorable truly ballet-style flats! They do run a little small, I am very squarely a size 7 shoe everywhere I go, but I had to return my size 7 in these and get the 7.5. The half-size up worked perfectly for me. I love these flats because they're really cute and they can be worn with a casual or dressy outfit. I wore these for my college graduation ceremonies and they were perfect! They are comfortable to wear all day, but I think they start feeling like they pinch your toes after a few hours, nothing unbearable, though.I don't like that they show a little bit of \"toe-cleavage\" but they're so beautiful otherwise it isn't worth deducting a star. A great feature that I didn't even think of that you get with this style is that the flats will hold on your feet even if they are dangling. Other flats would fall off your heels, but since these have the straps around the ankles, they stay securely on. The ankle straps are comfortable.They seem to be made of great quality material and at $20 they're a fantastic price for nice Jessica Simpson ballet flats. I originally saw a pair of Jessica Simpson flats just like this but with a square pointe toe at Dillards for $80! They haven't dropped in price in 2 years so I'm happy that I found these on Amazon. And I think the round toe is a lot cuter than the square/flat pointe style toe.",

But depressingly, it only takes about fifteen minutes of wearing them to give me terrible blisters on the sides of my foot and in my heel.

I thought maybe I just had to break them in, but every time I\u2019ve worn them has had the same painful blisters after a very short time. If you have longer toes, pass on these unless you like your foot bleeding.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these for a work party. To go with a themed outfit. They are a bit smaller than the true size says. I\u2019d say half a size. I normally wear a size 7 in dress shoes and flats. I went with a 7.5 after reading reviews and I\u2019m glad I did. They were a bit tight in the toe area at first but using a trick I learned some years ago (put a ziplock down in the shoe, fill the ziplock with water, and freeze them overnight) I didn\u2019t have to kill my feet to break them in. The ankle strap is not overly tight. So if you don\u2019t have issues with swelling. They\u2019re just right. If your feet do swell then go with a wider shoe. The sole of them is very comfortable and they are on the thinner side. If your like me, and have a wider toe base than your arch area. Then I\u2019d recommend a wider size, and a half size up. I do think they\u2019re a bit pricey for what they are, but they\u2019re definitely worth it. Especially given finding a flat with a strap is almost impossible. I wore them for 8 hours my first day and my feet were fine afterwards. If you are on your feet a lot. And don\u2019t normally wear dress shoes, or flats then these will be a change. But they were comfortable. I plan to test them out again in a few days. Just be aware there is not a lot of arch support in these, and they are a half size smaller than their size says. So if you want some wiggle room I\u2019d go for a size up. If you want a snug fit then a half size.",
