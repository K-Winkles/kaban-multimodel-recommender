They have support and a nice cushion. I purchased my regular size and they tend to run just a small bit large. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the sole is a little slick on tiled floors so be cautious when you first purchase. I'm thinking a little wear on the sole will take care of the problem.",

They were very professional about everything. --These shoes are big. I am a normal size 8 so I got the size 8 and man were these big. They were too long (there was a one and a half inch gap from my toes to the end of the shoe) and my heels slipped out when I walked. I even double-checked the size and it said 8 on both shoes. They were lightweight and soft to walk on, and you can take the insoles out and add your own which I did in hopes they would fit better. It helped a little bit my heels still slipped out everytime I stepped. So I returned them. I decided not to get a smaller size because I didn't like them.",

Price was great. Easy to slip on and off, and reliable sizing ( I Ordered the same size as my Skechers 5 shoe, and they fit slightly tight out of the box, but the material does stretch so I am confident they will be perfect).What I am less happy with: The sole is simply not as robust, and while still comfy, definable can tell they difference and I suspect they will compress much faster than Skechers do.Bottom line: perfectly ok shoe for working in garden or wearing inside but I\u2019ll wait for Skechers to go on sale vs buying these again",

The shoes are maybe a little bit too big (size 9) but I can sometimes be a 8.5 so that's fine, I can always put a sole inside if they stretch. They are super easy to slip on and off which is huge, and they are very comfortable. I use them to walk my dog every day. Better quality than something you'd get at like, Walmart, but not as expensive as Sketchers these days. 4.5/5",
