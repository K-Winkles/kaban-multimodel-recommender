                "reviewText": "When I first pulled out the shoes from it's box, I thought they looked huge, and even asked my son if they look like clown shoes on me lol, because the base of the shoe sticks out way past the end, unlike my running shoes. But that gives me stability on the court. I don't know if all court shoes are made like this since this is my first court shoe purchase in decades. I now LOVE this Adidas women's Gamecourt 2 shoe. I like that this appears to be a well-made shoe. I use it for pickleball. I've used it for several months, 2 to 3 times a week, sometimes 4 times a week. I feel like it will last and I'll get my money's worth. For me it runs a half size too large vs the same size shoe I buy for running, so I don't know if it's a brand difference, or a running shoe vs. court shoe difference, or this particular Adidas style of court shoe runs large, because I don't usually buy Adidas, and this is also my first court shoe purchase/use in decades. My feet are not fat, but are wide in the toe area. I have high arches so I kept this shoe even though it was a half size too long and also a bit too roomy from top to bottom, because 1) I'm lazy to return things, and 2) I knew I was going to experiment with different arch support inserts. My usual 3/4 length arch supports were too small to fill out this shoe for me, being that the shoes are a half size too large; it was okay but I had to really pull my laces tight. I play fine in my cheap 3/4 length AirPlus inserts, but I ordered the WalkHero arch supports in 6 to 6.5 size (that's how the insert comes, size-wise, my court shoe is a 6) and this REALLY filled out the shoe, I had to cram the insert in, now it fits really snug; I even left the original shoe insert in; you can easily remove it if you want to though. I could have trimmed the new insert but I was too lazy. I like my feet to be very snug in my court shoes anyway because I hate when I lunge for the ball and my foot slides even an 1/8 of an inch forward. If you're wearing it for fashion and like a not-too-snug fit, or want your feet to look bigger (yes some people do!) ordering your regular size shoe might be fine. I hope this review was helpful to you because it's so !@#$%$# hard to order shoes online, right?",

While playing I don\u2019t notice that they feel less supportive! I would buy these again.",
