The reviews were good so I decided to give them a try. I have really high arches so I try to find shoes that can support my feet. I was worried that the size 8 I ordered might not be a true size 8. I\u2019ve ordered shoes before that were not true to size, but I can honestly say these shoes are true to size. With the cushion inserts the shoes have I don\u2019t have any issues with my feet hurting because of my high arches. I could literally walk in this shoes for hours without any discomfort. They are extremely lightweight. I\u2019m really glad I decided to buy these, and the best part is it didn\u2019t cost me an arm and leg to get them.",

My niece walks on her toes and she loved them. Comfortable memory foam insole but probably wouldn\u2019t last long. Cheaply made. White glue residue along edges of outer sole. Cheap made materials. Very long laces so you have to double-knot. Stiff\u2026.definitely needs a long break-in time. Loud when you take steps.",

                "reviewText": "These shoes are very comfortable. I have wide feet and needed a good pair of walking shoes. These are great for me. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because the sole of the shoe is rounded outward making it slide and slip very easily on smooth surfaces. Great for walking on concrete and grass etc but terrible when on something like hardwood or laminated floors. I'm unable to stand still my shoes just start sliding my feet and legs apart. Still, I don't regret my purchase, they are very comfortable as I said and work great outside.",
