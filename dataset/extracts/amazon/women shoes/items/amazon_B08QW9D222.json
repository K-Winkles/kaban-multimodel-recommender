However, within the first hour of my shift they had cut into the back of my ankles and sides of my feet, and caused blisters. They were extremely painful to wear and I would not recommend these to anyone looking for a comfortable work shoe. I did wear them for the entirety of my shift but they remained stiff. I cannot use these nor do I think I can return them. I will be reaching out to Amazon to see if a return is possible though! If not it is a true waste of $60.",
