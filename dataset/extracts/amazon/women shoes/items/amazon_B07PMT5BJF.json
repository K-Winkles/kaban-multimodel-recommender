I received them (8W) and wore them right of the box for about a 2 mile christmas light walk. They were comfortable and padded. Not tight in anyway. Will def buy other pairs. Good for walking. I would not say there is any arch support but there is padding. I got the gold, really cute and can be for a dressy situation. First use and may update depending on wear and tear. I have now purchased the black/white patterned one. They are my favorite shoes to wear. They have little arch support but are pretty comfortable. They feel worn in and cause no issues. Slip in and out. Worn in the rain. I live in a place where it's always hot and they dont really make my feet sweaty which I really enjoy. so far my favorite shoe!",

While they fit okay (I have a wide foot with a bunion), they don't really look that great on the foot and aren't really very comfortable or have any support. I probably should have returned them, but didn't have time to look for a replacement and the color was good with the pants I was planning on wearing. Would I repurchase, definitely not. I just purchased a nice pair of Clarks ballet flats (more expensive but they offer support and a solid bottom), so these will be going to Goodwill!",

The quality seems ok for 20$ pair of ballet flats. I don't have toe cleavage, which is good. My toes do not stick out like some reviews, but I'm pretty sure that's because of their own feet, not the shoe! LolOverall, I'd buy again, so far, and would recommend.

I was worried that the gold would flake off, but after nearly two years of wear, they still look great and are easy to wipe clean. I will say that the fit was a bit shorter than I would have liked. I ordered and 11 and could have used a bit more room in the toe, so I would definitely order up. I have a narrow foot, and oftentimes shoes will gap, but the fit great, and offer plenty of stretch, so I imagine they would be comfy for wide feet as well! The are super lightweight, and great to throw in a bag, for a cute change of shoes if you're at an event in heels! Really like these shoes!",
