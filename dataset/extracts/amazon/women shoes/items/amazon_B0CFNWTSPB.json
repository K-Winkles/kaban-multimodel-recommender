I've had a foot reconstruction and wear orthotics, so I purchased these 1/2 size larger than I typically wear. I've only worn them once so far; they are very comfortable and fit well. NO breaking in necessary.I'm not wild about white shoes, but for the price, I'm all in. :-)",

                "reviewText": "I finally had to replace my Asics volleyball shoes that are no longer in production. I was super sad. I used the Prime try before you buy and tested out the Mizuno Women's 2 Wave Luminous, ASICS Women's Gel-Rocket 11 and Mizuno Wave Dimension. The 2 Wave Luminous were too narrow. They fit well, but I was worried I would blow out the sides in 1 season. The ASICS Gel Rocket 11 had a nice fit, but wasn't as comfortable.I have plantar Fasciitis and my original Asics never bothered my heals. I decided not to go with the new Asics Gel-Rocket 11 because it didn't feel like it would have enough cushion for my heals. It also didn't have as good of ankle support as the Mizuno. It's still a very nice shoe if you don't have those issues.",

However, they're still a bit wider than my foot, but they're as close as I could get to the right fit. \u2705\ufe0f",
