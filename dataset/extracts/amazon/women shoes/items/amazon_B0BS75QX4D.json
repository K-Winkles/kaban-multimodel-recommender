                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Not Quite a Size 10\u2026",
                "reviewText": "I read the reviews and waffled on buying these. I wear a size 10 in every shoe I own, and my foot is pretty much average width, trending to the narrower side of normal. Thought I\u2019d try them as a replacement for the S. Oliver\u2019s I got in Ireland and can\u2019t find here (BEST. CANVAS. SNEAKER. EVER!!!!). Here are my thoughts:COLORI ordered black. These are, technically, black. Technically. But the color is such a washed out shade that wearing them with black leggings makes the shoe look off\u2014almost worn out given the intentionally frayed fabric edges. They\u2019re okay with jeans, but I hesitate to pair them with a true black anything (shirt, skirt, pants, shorts, etc.).FITYeah\u2026NOT a true 10. I recently had my left hip replaced so I have a long shoe horn to help me get sneakers on (except my beloved Kiziks which I now wear almost exclusively). If I didn\u2019t have the shoe horn and the benefit of some flexibility regained over 2 months of physical therapy, these wouldn\u2019t go on. Period. They are SUPER snug. I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll stretch with frequent wearing. If they don\u2019t? I\u2019ll be putting them up for sale with full disclosure on the fit. The heel is snug, and I like that they don\u2019t slip. But the toe box isn\u2019t truly rounded so my toes are squished together like little polished sardines! LOL Despite the more pointed toe, they don\u2019t really make my foot look long. That\u2019s a plus but one that won\u2019t qualify if it turns out I can\u2019t wear them.QUALITYThey seem well made overall. The fraying fabric gives them a worn look as noted above. The one thing that surprised me was the tread. The bottoms are seriously slick on hardwood floors and tile right out of the box. I went out and scuffed them up some on the driveway, but I think it\u2019s going to take a few seatings before they aren\u2019t so slick.OVERALLI\u2019m not thrilled with them. I ordered a white pair before these arrived, and I\u2019m 95% sure I\u2019ll be returning them without opening the box. I\u2019m just not sure they\u2019re the right canvas sneaker for me given that I\u2019m not positive I\u2019ll be able to comfortably wear them.Hope this helps!",
