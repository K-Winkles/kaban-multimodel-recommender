                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the ASICS Women's Jolt 3 Running Shoes and I am extremely happy with my purchase. These shoes have exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, support, and durability.Firstly, the comfort level of these shoes is excellent. The cushioning in the midsole provides a responsive and comfortable ride, absorbing impact and reducing strain on my feet and joints. I can run for longer distances without any discomfort or fatigue.The fit of the Jolt 3 is also great. The shoes have a snug and secure fit, hugging my feet without feeling too tight. The lace-up closure allows for easy adjustment and customization of the fit. I appreciate that these shoes come in various width options, ensuring a perfect fit for different foot types.In terms of support, the Jolt 3 delivers. The shoes offer excellent arch support, which is crucial for those with high arches like myself. The midfoot area provides stability and prevents any unwanted rolling or twisting during runs. I feel confident and stable in these shoes, even on uneven surfaces.Durability is another standout feature of the Jolt 3. The shoes are made with high-quality materials that have held up well even after several months of regular use. The outsole has good traction, providing grip on different surfaces. I appreciate that these shoes are built to last, as it saves me from having to replace them frequently.The design of the Jolt 3 is simple yet stylish. They come in a variety of color options, allowing for personalization and matching with different workout outfits. The breathable mesh upper keeps my feet cool and dry during runs, adding to the overall comfort of the shoes.Overall, I highly recommend the ASICS Women's Jolt 3 Running Shoes for any female runners looking for a comfortable, supportive, and durable option. These shoes provide the necessary features to enhance your running experience, allowing you to focus on your performance. Lace up a pair of Jolt 3 shoes and hit the road with confidence.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these specifically to use at the gym, primarily on the treadmill and stair climber. I usually spend twice as much on cross trainers that I can also wear while hiking but my standbys were killing my feet on the treadmill for some reason. These fit perfectly and were comfortable right out of the box. There was no breaking-in period; I wore them for the first time doing 20 minutes on a stair climber followed by 40 minutes on the treadmill and my feet were totally fine, no sore spots, no rubbing, no blisters. The inner is plush and cushiony. They look pretty sharp, too. Overall I'm very pleased with the quality and thrilled with the price. I've also owned Asics before and I've found they last longer than Nikes. 10/10 would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "These shoes are great for walking and running. I have a job that requires me to be on my feet for long periods of time and these shoes are great for that. I have just the right amount of support and comfort. I bought a size 9, my feet are 8.5 wide and they fit perfect. I actually have a little toe room which is why I bought a larger size, since most shoes seems to run small, I didn't want my feet to be cramped or run the risk of having to return the shoes for being too small.Great shoes. I have three pairs of ASICS now and every pair is well made. They last a long time. I still have a pair I bought in 2010. Well-made shoes. Love the durability and comfort. This won't be the last ASICS shoe I buy.Highly recommend.",
