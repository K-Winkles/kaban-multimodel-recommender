I wanted wide, so went to AMAZON and was not disappointed!! For a lower price, I got better fitting Skechers. The pink ones are Go Walk Joy, and the other two are these Go Walk Flex Relish. The Flex Relish are really slip in - no hassle - no bending. I have worn only Birkenstock for a few decades, but as I age my knees and feet really cannot do the harder surfaces for any length of time. I had some walking to do so I bought a pair of these locally. WOW.....fit and comfy from the first minute. The wide are a better fit for me, but I wear the regular ones sometimes too - best idea is to have several pairs of shoes and rotate them. Oddly they last longer that way. I know I will buy more of these too. All I can say is BUY a pair of the Flex Relish and enjoy the comfort. I have had these now for two months so thought it was a good time for a review!",

We remove our shoes upon entering our homes so a slip-in feature is a huge bonus. When these Go-Walk Slip-ins became available, we found THE best price with Amazon. I wear a women's size 7-1/2 to 8 -- based on Amazon's viewership recommendation, I bought an 8 wide, black -- perfectly sized, comfortable, adequate padding, style-neutral to wear with dress-up or -down pants, great for all-day wear. My 90-year old Mom who's had foot problems tried on my 8s and was convinced enough to order a 7-1/12 wide, black. They arrived yesterday and she's been wearing them constantly as a house shoe -- we may have to order a second pair as an 'outside' shoe. My sister tried on my 8s and she, too, ordered an 8-1/2 wide, black and is awaiting delivery. Yup, happy customers with both Skechers and Amazon but most especially Amazon Prime as we got these great shoes at THE best price. THANK YOU!",

I've never tired the new 'slip ons' before and so I figured that would work. They are a bit snug/tight. Not as loose as others I have tried. I do not have wide feet. But think because you're supposed to slide these on - maybe they stretch a bit in wear? Not sure. They are not uncomfortable tight, but thought I should mention it in case that matters. I just got them so I will update if there is anything substantial to note. Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest, personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. As a top 30 reviewer, I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6,200 reviews posted, those reviews have been viewed well over 50,000 times, including well over 28,000 likes.

                "reviewText": "So easy to step into and go. They are holding up well ands came out of the wash in great shape. They stay on without a thought and come off easily.****I bought a pair for my mom for Christmas. She's 81 and has nerve damage to her leg and cannot feel anything below one knee. This means she can't easily insert her foot into a regular shoe AND due to flexibility issues, she cannot bend down to tie tennis shoes. If my dad isn't home or I'm not visiting, she can only slip into shoes without a back. Due to no feeling in her foot, if her foot becomes askew in her shoe as she walks (even 1 stair is a danger), she can easily fall, which she has, and seriously hurt herself, which she has.These shoes have been a GAME CHANGER for both of my parents. She can get into and out of them ON HER OWN and they are secure on her feet. Her entire gait has changed and she walks with more confidence. My dad can comfortably leave in the morning, even if she isn't yet up, as she can put on her own shoes. She has not fallen once since Christmas, and she was falling at least once or twice a week! We have ordered 2 more styles & colors for her.**For my next pair, I'll try one with the arch support and/or maximum cushioning. My Hoka, ON Cloud & Nike have spoiled me. These, however, are half the price and the style is definitely more subtle and goes with non-workout clothing much better. I do miss the extra support at the end of a long day on my feet though.",

She uses a walker to steady herself and she can put these shoes on while standing instead of having to sit down and bend over as she did with her previous shoes.
