Got glue on them and now I don't want to wear them in the house. Going to use as gardening shoes. POINT IS: First pair felt so good (I've had 2 back surgeries & my back always hurts and so do mt feet)............That after getting glue on them............I ordered a 2nd pair thinking hey they will be the same and ruining the first pair was my own fault. Guess What......2nd pair not the same, straight out of box, cushion pad does not feel the same and I could tell someone had tried on the right shoe and stretched it out. (I always try on left shoe). Since they are only for in the house, I walked around in them for awhile, stretched left shoe out. Now they fit the same, BUT I cannot wear them all day like the first pair I purchased. They make my back hurt ....Unbelievable, same dang shoe. Quality Control is problem. Pray you get a good pair as I know for a fact you have a 50/50 chance. I would send them back, but I have worn them in the house for safety reasons as I am a fall risk. Not worth chancing it ladies, move onto another shoe & keep looking.",

Price point made them affordable.Dislike: 1) Heel does not seem to be cut high enough; I feel like I'm going to walk right out of them. 2) Fit is a bit snug. This may improve over time. 3) Wore them briefly outside on a thin layer of snow. The treads actually collected the snow and formed a slippery coating that did not easily stamp, scuff, or scrape off. Consequently, they were VERY slippery on smooth surfaces. As this was one of the primary reasons for my choice, I am disappointed that I can't rely on these shoes to help keep my bones intact.",

But let me tell you, my feet hurt ALL THE TIME. I'm a waitress and my dogs are always barking, even outside of work. They just constantly sore from my shifts. I put these shoes on just to see how they feel and WOW. I got arch support, and I can feel cushion on the parts of my feet that always hurt the most. Walking around feels like I'm walking on cushions on all the right parts of my feet. I can't wait to wear these bad boys to work, I may just get a pair for outside work cause they kinda cute too. And they make me look taller. Love them!!! I'm really just walking around my house in them right now because the cushion feels so good on my sore feet. Also I wear a size 8, ordered an 8 and they fit perfectly. Picture of me wearing these bad boys and a picture of my old work shoes. Very excited and happy. UPDATE- I'm updating in May 2022, these shoes are still doing me great. I'm about in need of another pair but they are still intact the insoles are just wearing down a bit but I am on my feet walking non stop for 40 hours a week so I'd say that lasting me this long is great. I will absolutely be buying another pair of these. Love them!!!",
