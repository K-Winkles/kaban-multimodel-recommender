They have rubberized pegs that I guess give better traction for playing golf, but they do not squeek, click or anything but provide comfortable walking on concrete floors at my retail place of employment. No other shoes have allowed my feet to be pain free on concrete floors. FINALLY A COMFORTABLE ATHLETIC SHOE!!!",

I walk 18 holes several times a week and have been very happy with them. They offer great traction and provide great support.",

                "reviewText": "I mistakenly ordered a pair of Adidas golf shoes years ago, not realizing they were actually golf shoes (they were spikeless). Well, they ended up being my favorite shoes ever and lasted a very long time. So when I saw these, I decided to order them, even though these are a little different than the ones I bought many years ago.Well, I am definitely not disappointment with these. They were a great deal and they are VERY comfortable, supportive, and well-made. I like that the bottom give me some grip. These work great to wear as every day sneakers, just like my other ones did. Since these shoes are a tad more narrow than some sneakers, I wouldn\u2019t recommend for anyone with a wide foot. My foot is average width with high arches and for me, they\u2019re perfect because they provide that support right where I need it. True to size.",
