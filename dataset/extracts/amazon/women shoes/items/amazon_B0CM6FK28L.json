I LOVE the animal print color. HOWEVER, I immediately had to place bandaids to cover the seam under my ankles as both shoes cut in and really hurt as I stood and took just a few steps. I plan on wearing bandaids under my ankle to prevent blisters when I wear them to work! I do hope the discomfort caused by these 2 seams goes away with wear. I do like the padded insoles. The comfort it provides does not go unnoticed.",

Had a little break in time especially in the heel. The cushion in th sole is wonderful, very easy to have these on all day. Nice support. Toe box is roomy enough my toes can move without feeling crowded. Heel doesn\u2019t slip off while walking. Overall a fabulous pointed toe shoe, which will be one of my staple wears.",

This is true for these shoes. I\u2019m glad I sized up! They fit perfectly, and any smaller would not have worked.Unfortunately, the edge of the back of the shoe is sharp and very, very uncomfortable on my heels. I wore them to work today, but although I\u2019m at a computer and not walking around, by lunchtime I had blisters on my heels and needed to go home to change shoes.I\u2019ll try adding some padding or moleskin or something to the back to see if that helps, but for now, my heels are covered in bandages. They\u2019re pretty shoes and perfect flats for jeans or dressy slacks, but out of the box, they\u2019re horrifically painful after only a short time even though they fit very well. Any larger and my heel would slide in and out as I walk, which would be even more painful!",
