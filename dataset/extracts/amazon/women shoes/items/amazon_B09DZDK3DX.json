Happy to find them again and bought two pair - they are well-made, super comfortable, and easy to put on. The only thing that's different about these newer ones is the insoles start to come out sometimes when you take them off, but it's just a minor problem to stick them back in. They're great for walking, fast to put on, and look nice enough to wear with khakis. Love them and will buy again if these ever wear out!",

                "reviewText": "My review is based on using these as an everyday shoe, not necessarily in the water. I ordered 9 1/2 my usual size. There is plenty of length and width. The top is a bit tight, but I'm sure will loosen up with wear. If you wear a sock, they'll be even tighter on the top until they loosen up. If you have bunions, no problem. They have no pressing points or seams in that area. The cammo color is over all a forest green, very little cammo color, but still a nice looking shoe. The heel back is super soft, so there's no way you can slip these on, you'll need to tug them on or use a shoe horn, which I did. It's true that the insole pulls out when you remove your foot, I might glue it in if it bugs me too much. Overall, very comfortable with a squishy foot bed, they look nice, and not too costly.",
