I have plantar fasciitis so can\u2019t wear most nicer shoes. I have gotten so many compliments on these from coworkers, patients, parents! I got the taupe color and they go with everything. I\u2019ve worn them about a dozen times and my feet never bother me after. I can walk all over my large hospital or wait for the bus after work. I\u2019m a size 6.5 and sized up to 7.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to love these so much, but no way. It was very difficult to even get my foot in, because of how high the top comes forward to your ankle. When I finally did get them on, that definitely presses into my ankle and would be a problem if worn. I also don't feel like these are a true wide, they're very narrow. But, they probably would stretch out as most shoes do. The pointed toe is a problem for me as far as width also. I could see my toes being sore if wearing these at work all day.The color was disappointing too! I was looking forward to a slight pink tone like the pictures! They're are straight up beige ): the texture is beautiful though! If they had fit, the different texture would have made me overlook the no pink coloring!If you're not actually a wide width and have tiny ankles, these shoes are made for you!",

But then one night at the gas station some gasoline decided to spray all over me, and my shoes reeked of gasoline, so, therefore I had to put the shoes in the washer. The smell reduced but my left shoe doesn't fit as if it shrunk. I'm thinking at first that maybe I just need to stretch it back to my size, but only does it feel too small but there's a piece of the shoe inside the back that I cannot move or even out, it's stuck there, and when I put my shoe on it hurts the back of my foot. I cannot seem to fix it, I hate that my good pair of work shoes are ruined.",

Since I knew what size I needed, I was confident in ordering that same size in the grey/khaki shade. It's more khaki in color to my eyes than anything. What bothers me is the shipping. They were not in a shoe box. They were in a plastic bag, shoved into a white Amazon flimsy mailer. When they arrived on my doorstep, they were semi-crushed and actually appear that they may have been worn before. There is some debris on the bottom of each shoe, and a small black looking smudge/scuff mark on one shoe. I do not expect to pay for new shoes, and have them come in all wrinkled and crumpled because Amazon was too cheap to send them in their box.",
