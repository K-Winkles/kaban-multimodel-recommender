So many times I\u2019ve bought other types of shoes or sneakers in wide and they\u2019re not wide enough. These are! I would buy them again, in did buy the grey ones, very similar style. Also a great fit!",

                "reviewText": "I discovered this brand at Costco and was happlily surprised at what good walking shoes they were. I have gotten several other pairs and love the variety of colors. I enjoy getting fun colors that will go with black and blue colored jeans and trousers. I was happlily surprised to find that this was a skecher and very happy to see that is just as comfy as the more tennis shoe looking versions. One downside of a light color is a need to clean them and these got a stain during a move I was making. I zapped the stain with oxyclean and threw them in the washer with other clothing and they washed up great! I did let them air dry. I am very happy with the look and the performance.",

For the amount of walking I do, the soles are in very good condition, cam be a little slippery on certain surfaces (ie: ceramic or painted lines when crossing the street) but overall a lovely shoe for everyday!",
