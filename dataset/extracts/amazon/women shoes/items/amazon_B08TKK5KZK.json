However, upon receiving it, I noticed that the size seemed smaller compared to other Clarks shoes I own in size 7. Consequently, I had to return it and placed a new order for size 7.5. The replacement fits well and feels comfortable. My only concern is that it feels slightly too lightweight, raising doubts about the quality of the leather.",

I went online to see if I could find them elsewhere and every source had them for less, but Amazon\u2019s price was the lowest - close to half of what Kohl\u2019s was charging. They are the exact same shoes and comfortable as expected. This was definitely a good buy!",
