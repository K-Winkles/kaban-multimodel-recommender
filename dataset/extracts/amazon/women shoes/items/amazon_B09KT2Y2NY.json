                "reviewText": "I ordered this after having a similar shoe by North Face about 6 years ago but was water proof, and I LOVED the pair, and was hoping this was it. Now, I just got them, so the review is before testing on a hike.... I need wide shoes and they fit a little big. This being said, the insole is crap. Let's be honest. The rest of the shoe is pretty awesome, but for the price and name, North Face could do better than what they give. I immediately removed the cheap insole and inserted a used pair of TAOS insoles. My TAOS shoes were dead, but the insoles still have life. (If you don't know about TAOS, they have amazing insoles and the best arch support), those insoles made these North Face fit PERFECT and feel 100% wonderful. So, if you need arch support and are willing to go the extra distance, then these shoes are definitely worth it.",

I have very wide feet and it's hard to find comfortable shoes that aren't tight (if I size up in shoes, then they are too long). Thankfully these have plenty of room. Used them in rain and so far so good! Love them!",
