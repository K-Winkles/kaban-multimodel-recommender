I wear a women's size 7 in ( hey you know who) and I bought these Bruno Marc shoes in women's size 7 and they were a perfect fit, not too tight and not too loose. I am currently wearing Bruno Marc on my right foot and HD on the left foot and the comfort is super close, the only difference is my other pair is broken in. The color I bought is black and they look good (not faded). They also came with an extra pair of insoles. They are light weight, and the stitching looks good. The price was good but I did purchase them on Black Friday. I would definitely buy them again.",

                "reviewText": "Initial review: These shoes were just too narrow for my feet.Update: After posting my review, this company's customer service representative, May reached out to me to understand why I was dissatisfied with the pair of shoes I bought. She, initially offered me a full refund but I had already returned the shoes & gotten back my money. She, then gave me to choice to choose a pair of shoes free of cost. I choose a 10.5 in a male size as I felt that the male design in the type i choose was similar to the female design i had initially bought and the design is what initially made me choose the shoes. The new shoes, I received were prefect width wise, so definitely not too narrow, they were a little big length wise but I think a good pair of thick shoes will make them work for me. I got a black pair with extra soles & extra shoe laces which were perfect. I love the design of the shoes, they are comfortable & can wear with alot of different outfits. I will definitely be purchasing shoes from this company in the future for me & my family. The number one thing for me was comfort as I have three young children & these shoes are definitely comfortable, so i will change my one star review to five. Thank you so much May, I would give you 10 stars if I could. You were so patient & kind. I look forward to purchasing chasing my kids around in these comfortable shoes. I think I may purchase a pair for my husband & kids too & another pair for myself. Thanks again May to you & your company.",

But, as said I\u2019ve put these thru the ringer because they\u2019re so comfortable.Pros-super comfy, extra soles come and was great when the first got thin after solid 6 mths of heavy use.-they still look good after a yearCons-although pretty the elastic shoe strings stretch and I found I needed to tie them tighter and trimming the elastic made it look crappy.-material sides stretched, gives less side of your foot support, if I wear them for any long distance or full day walking my feet hurt, but didn\u2019t when they were new",
