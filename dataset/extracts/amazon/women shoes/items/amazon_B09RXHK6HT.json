They were stuck in place, like stuck to whatever is supposed to hold the insole in place\u2026\u2026 I decided to just leave it alone until they\u2019re worn out and need to be replaced.",

They do make my feet perspire a bit so I have to switch them out after a few hours of wearing them, but I do love them.",

If I had foot problems, I would think twice about these Amazon shoes, but if your feet are fine, these Amazon shoes are a very good choice. I have worn mine just a few times, but then again I don\u2019t go out much with a hand healing from an extremely painful surgery. Wrist breaks are insanely painful. Take care of your bones! I had to buy slip ons since I can\u2019t tie shoes right now.So give these shoes a whirl. They are comfortable and the positive reviews are true. And take care of your bones.",
