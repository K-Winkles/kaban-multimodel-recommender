I was looking for a shoe that was relaxed around the toe area and these shoes were perfect and comfortable. Playing pickle ball with the correct shoes on makes a big difference in your ability to keep the ball going. The shoes have a nice sole that grips the pavement securely allowing me to go after those balls hit close to the lines. I would definitely order again and recommend!",

The comfort level is off the charts, and the cushioning provides fantastic support during long matches. The grip and stability are exceptional, allowing me to make those quick movements without slipping. What I love most is how lightweight they are, which keeps my feet from feeling tired.

While not as stiff as some court shoes and pickleball shoes, I'm okay with it as it is more comfortable than some of the stiffer court shoes yet still more supportive than regular sneakers or running shoes on the court. I didn't give it a 5 because it was a little smaller than expected versus my other Sketchers but maybe because these are for pickleball and need to be a bit more snug for adequate support.",

                "reviewText": "I just started playing pickleball at 79 years old and I love it. I read that one should always wear pickle ball shoes to prevent foot and ankle injuries. I always love sketchers so purchased these shoes. They are very comfortable and I am able to move well in them. Unfortunately they have not improved my game but that really doesn't have anything to do with the shoes.",
