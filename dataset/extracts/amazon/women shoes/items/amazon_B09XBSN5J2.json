Even better, no odd angles inside the sole of the shoe to make you feel like you are falling backwards or forwards when you wear them, either. The previous under armor brand shoes i had owned were terrible, so I was slightly worried initially, but these are way better, no complaints! Very satisfied.",

The interior feels very comfortable when wearing and the outsole utilizes durable rubber that ensures a smooth stride while walking or running. The black rubber outsole increases durability. Shipping was fast and the shoes actually arrived a couple days earlier than expected.The breathable upper mesh is ideal for staying cool during runs or workouts. The comfortable interior and rubber outsole provide a great experience whether training outdoors or at the gym. The fast shipping and durability make these an excellent product that will last for miles to come.I tried to summarize the key points from the Spanish description into an engaging English review that highlights the benefits of the shoes. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the review in any way. I can also add more specifics about sizing, appearance or other details as needed.",

                "reviewText": "THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLACK AND BABY BLUE SNEAKERS.Below you\u2019ll see a different review for another color. I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s combined and not separated. Anyways I bought the black and blue pair in a size 12 after trying on the 11s in purple. They were wicked small and tight. These 12s are a much better fit. That\u2019s all I can say at the moment because I just got them on and tried them on. I figured I could at least give some input on the sizing if anyone else is in question. Definitely size up one size. Usually I wear wide, but these seem to be ok. Time will tell as I wear them. I\u2019ll come back in the future if I feel like I need to share any other information about these.=================\u2022================THIS PART OF MY REVIEW THE FOR THE PURPLE SNEAKERS. . The reason for 3 stars is because the of the sizing. These run extremely small! And I mean small! These were for my mother in law and we both wear the same size sneakers, especially in Under Armour. She tried them on and said they were so tight and that her toe goes far up and we\u2019re wicked uncomfortable. So I tried them on, without socks and the same thing. I thought maybe she was exaggerating but she was not. The color is very pretty and it\u2019s a shame that they run so small. I probably should\u2019ve checked the reviews after she picked them out but we\u2019ve never had issues like this with this brand. Many reviews stated they ran wicked small. Anyways, we wear a 10-11. Wide if available and depending on the style. Unfortunately they don\u2019t have any 12s in stock, otherwise I would\u2019ve exchanged it for those to try. Instead I just have to send them back to Amazon. Needless to say I would order at least 1-2 sizes UP from your normal size. Or simply go with another shoe if this issue would be is an inconvenience.",
