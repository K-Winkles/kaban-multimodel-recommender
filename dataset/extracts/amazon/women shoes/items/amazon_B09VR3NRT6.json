They\u2019re slip on which is always a plus and feel like I\u2019m wearing socks, that\u2019s how comfortable they are. If you\u2019re looking for sneakers that you don\u2019t have to worry about eventually pinching or falling apart, I highly recommend these.",

I would describe these as very light weight, & form fitting. Almost a mix of a running shoe, & water sock. I wore them for the first time yesterday, to go work out. I stopped for a quick store run first. I was wearing footie socks, & with in 5min. walking through the store, both my heals were bleeding, & on fire. I had to stop everything, found a pair of ankle length socks, & some heal blister bandaids not on my list. Lol I would recommend wearing no shorter than an ankle sock with these. Later after my workout, I currently live in Montana, where it's been snow, & ice for months. I stepped on a ice patch, & went down pretty hard. These sneakers have no real tread for traction, & the soles are a slick glossy foam. That being said, I like the way they look, how they're form fitting great for indoor work outs, & are comfortable. Besides the heal area on bare skin, where there's a strap loop, to help you pull them on. I would not recommend these sneakers for the outdoors in poor weather conditions.",
