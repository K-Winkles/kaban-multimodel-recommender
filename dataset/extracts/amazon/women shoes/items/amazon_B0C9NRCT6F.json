I always wear an 8.5 in Clarks and other dress shoes, except for Ralph Lauren where I am a size 9. I ordered these shoes in a size 9 and the length is perfect, however my feet won't stay in the shoe because it is very wide. Sadly I had to return these as I think a size 8 would be too short in the length for my feet. These shoes are gorgeous, very well made, and nicely cushioned on the inside. I would 100% recommend them for anyone with a wide foot and I would recommend ordering your usual size for in heels and dress shoes.",

                "reviewText": "I can\u2019t walk in most heels but these make me feel like I can do anything! It\u2019s true what people say to size up 1/2 - 1 size up. I\u2019m typically a 9 (or 8.5 in certain shoes) and I went with a 9.5 and they fit perfect! Super comfy. Easy to walk in. Stylish. Cute. If you want a looser fit go with 1 size up. Only 2 nit picks I have is the gold doesn\u2019t extend all the way down on the heel/shows the rubber bottom and the gold on the bow is a slightly different shade than the gold on the heels but this is super nit picking. Lol Would purchase in other colors! Love them!",
