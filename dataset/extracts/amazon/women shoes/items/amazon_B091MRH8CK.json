They provide good support and cushioning for all the ways my feet move on the tennis court. The styling is a bit odd -- they look like that are covered with clear plastic in places -- but I quickly got used to that.I wear between an 8.5 and a 9, depending on the brand and type of socks I'm wearing. Because I tend to wear thicker, Thorlo socks for tennis, the 9 fits well. (I tend to wear a 9 in Adidas tennis shoes, although sometimes I encounter a model that's too big.) The first time I wore these, I forgot that I was wearing new shoes. They did not stick to the court or have uncomfortable pressure points.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",

The laces begin too high on the toe box and too far from the tip of the shoe making it impossible to tighten the shoe around the ball of foot and toes. I am a solid size 10 woman\u2019s, but the 10 was too short and the 10.5 was the perfect length but way too roomy in width. They also look and feel large and clunky. I bought them for hard court tennis because I\u2019ve had great success with adidas and this style for years in the past.",

I don't necessarily need a \"wide\" toe box but I needed one that \"high enough\" to accommodate my toe/toe nail.I tried Yonex, Asics, Wilson, and Babolat shoes over the course of 6-12 months. With all these, my big toe would go numb, or my ankles would move around, or they did not provide the torsional stiffness I needed to move side to side confidently.These Avacourts worked beautifully! I am getting my 2nd pair and I may just stock up in case they stop making them. I was skeptical of the design but the functionality is superb! I have them in the yellow and get lots of compliments.",

They are comfy and help a lot with stability but the tongue is so long it rubs on my ankle and created a raw spot after only 3 games of Pickleball. The tongue is also not padded and the edge of it is rough adding to the problem! I will have to try higher socks but this is a real disappointment. I cannot return them since I wore them already. Weird they would make this obvious design flaw.",
