I had no discomfort with all the walking I did and they are lighter than a traditional athletic shoe. I will be buying other colors.",

My sister has a pair of Bob's that she loves, so when I saw that this pair was on sale, I went for it. I liked them so much that I bought some waterproofing spray so that I can still wear them in fall and spring! They are very good basic shoes and although I've had them for several months now, they are holding up really, really well. They still look brand new, and as an added bonus, the waterproofing spray did not change the color, which is sometimes a problem with canvas-type shoes.Honestly, they're even better than I expected.",
