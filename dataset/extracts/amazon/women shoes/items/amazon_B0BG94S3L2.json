                "reviewText": "I wanted some grey sneakers for everyday wear. Put these in my \u201cwish list\u201d and my kids got them for me for Xmas. Adidas is my go to for sneakers, for quality, style and overall comfort. The shoes are cute. They run slightly big but overall sizing fits. However I am so disappointed in the feel. The cloud foam is almost nonexistent. They feel like the have 1/2 the cushion as my other adidas sneakers. These would not be adequate for any kind of actual fitness activity. They are fine for running errands but they aren\u2019t nearly as comfy as my other adidas shoes. If I bought these myself, I would have returned them but since they were a gift from my sweet kiddos, I want them to see me wearing them. I told my husband I might find some nice cushiony inserts for them.",

All other Adidas I have bought you can remove the insoles. When trying them on they did not feel like Cloudfoam shoes. They felt lumpy and one was more cushiony then the other. This was my first time buying Adidas from Amazon and will be my last, I\u2019ll stick to retailers and official Adidas site.",
