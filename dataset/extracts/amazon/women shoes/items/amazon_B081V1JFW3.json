Canvas is a bit stiff so hopefully they do break in.So after breaking in I wanted to update: they loosened up alot and often slip off the heel, and unfortunately they make your feet smell horrible. I've never had an issue with any shoe making my feet stink, ever, until these. They make your feet sweat and it feels like the soles are wet the next day still. It's pretty gross. I only wear them for quick errands, no more than and hour or 2 at a time and they are so funny already. Sad because they are cute but the memory foam sole seems to be a breeding ground for moisture and smell...",
