I am 61 years old, have a narrow foot, plantar fasciitis, and a remarkably high arch, so I must remove whatever inserts come with the sneaker and add my own Aetrex inserts. Once I do this, I can walk in these all day. I normally wear a 10; purchased a 10; and they fit perfectly.",

I went to SoftMoc and tried them on in store and definitely needed an 8. Keep in mind that the toe box is tapered and ridged so it will not stretch as it is a thick canvas with stitching design. The rest of the shoe is much more forgiving. I would recommend if you have a wide foot or long toes to go up one full size for comfort. Otherwise, medium width feet not prone to swelling should buy your regular size.",
