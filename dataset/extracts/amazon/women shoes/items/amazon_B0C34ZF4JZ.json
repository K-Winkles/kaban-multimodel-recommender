I had had Dr. Scholl\u2019s shoes before and found them to be very comfortable for walking. The third day of my trip I looked down while on a house tour and saw the tan rubber (or whatever) strip hanging off my shoe almost tripping me. It was off almost all the way around the shoe. I had no choice but to remove it from the shoe. Obviously, this was not a good design. I still have the strip on the other shoe because removing it from that shoe is not easy, so now the shoes do not match.",
