For a hiking trip with my family and even hiked over 8 miles on one of the days. No discomfort in my feet whatsoever. The cushioning feels comparable to Hokas. The support and structure was great and allowed me to get my shoe a little wet without my feet, and did not feel any of the rocks or branches through the soles. A fantastic product and I highly recommend! Plus, they\u2019re cute!",

I didn\u2019t have to break them in much and they were so comfy to hike in. I usually wear between a 8-8.5, and decided on a 8 wide to give myself a bit more room. Definitely recommend",

                "reviewText": "I really struggle to find sneakers I like. Practical ones feel too blocky typically, and then slim ones feel like they\u2019re just for aesthetic wear out after the lightest use in only a season or two.These are the perfect go-between. They\u2019re not the slimmest shoe, but they don\u2019t feel or look like bricks on your feet. They\u2019re very comfortable and breathable.I\u2019ve only been walking on paved trails with these\u2014I use chacos or hiking boots to hike true trails depending on the season\u2014but for the purpose I do use them for (walks, day-to-day, errands, casual wear) they\u2019re exactly what I was looking for!!The color I ordered looked more of a warmer gray/beige than I actually received (more of a cooler/neutral gray). That could be a digital image thing, but I looked on multiple websites and on different devices at these before ordering here and they all portrayed the color as differently than what they are in person. I like the color so I\u2019m fine with them, but I did take a star off for that discrepancy as some people may be fixed on a particular color scheme.",
