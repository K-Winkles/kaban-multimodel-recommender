                "reviewText": "Several years ago I ordered a similar pair of shoes from a well-known designer brand, and returned them as they made my feet look enormous. These \"Nude-pu\" colored ballet flats are simply elegant and wonderful. They do run a bit large, but that worked for me as I have a small bunion on each foot. These shoes did not pinch or squeeze my feet at all thanks to them being just a smidge large and due to the square toe box. They also didn't make it look like I have clown feet (which the aforementioned returned pair did). The elastic is a little loose around the ankle, but I prefer that to it being too tight. While I won't be walking around a city in these all day, they work for a day at my job and look so cute paired with a dress or cropped pants.",

I've worn these to work the past 2 days and day 1 was worse than day 2 but there was still some soreness and redness at the end of the day. I would recommend breaking them in slower than I did but they will absolutely stretch and lose up so that shouldn't be as big of an issue in the future. The elastic straps are cute and help hold the shoe on without squeezing. I have an office job but I walk a lot and occasionally need to run so the straps holding these flats to my feet are perfect.",

                "reviewText": "These are cute ballet flats with a square toe. They have a rigid shape but the material is soft enough so that it doesn\u2019t cause blisters where the edges of the shoe meet your skin when moving around in them all day. They are quite comfortable, but there isn\u2019t a lot of cushion in the sole, what little there is will likely not last long. If you need arch support, you will need some inserts for these shoes. My biggest problem with these are the straps that wrap around the ankle. It\u2019s unfortunate that they aren\u2019t adjustable or removable; they do have a bit of stretch for larger ankles but if you have smaller ones like myself, you are out of luck. I will probably just cut the straps off altogether because apart from that, I do like the style and versatility of these flats.",

The length is perfect. The width is very comfortable. My foot is slightly on the wide side of normal. The elastic is not snug enough to hold the shoe attractively without gapping. It is tight enough to hold the shoe comfortably on my foot and get on and off easily.I tried them on first with knee-hi hose - the elastic was way too loose. I switched to socks and the problem is not so obvious. The straps blend with the socks.",

                "reviewText": "Frankly, I didn't expect a whole lot out of these shoes other than looking cute. I had read that others thought they ran large, so my hope was that I would be able to fit orthotic insoles in them to make them more comfortable. But I found the size to be just right, not tight, but certainly with no room to spare for insoles. Just in case, I tried to fit them in, but it was just too tight with them in. So I gave up and wore them as is, certain that at the end of the day I was going to regret it. Imagine my surprise when after 5 hours of being on my feet, they did not hurt at all! In addition, I received several compliments on them. They did look nice. I wore them with ankle high nylons, as it's winter currently, but I can easily see wearing them with just liners in the summer with shorts or dresses.The hidden wedge is helpful in making them more comfortable, I think. If they were truly flats, I don't think they would feel nearly as good. They have enough width to accommodate feet a little wider than normal, especially through the toes, but I don't think they would fit someone with truly wide feet. But my toes definitely have room, and with a bunion that's important.In others' pictures, I thought the crisscross straps looked a bit loose, but I did not find them so myself. They fit nicely, without binding or pinching. The fit was just up against the skin, enough to feel as though they were not going to fall off, but not that they were going to leave marks on your ankles.These really surprised me - in a good way. They were kind of the Goldilocks shoe I wasn't expecting. Now if they hold up well, I'll be a happy camper.",

                "reviewText": "These shoes do run a little big, but so far, it does not seem to be an issue. Buyers may want to order a half size smaller, if possible, however the listing does not show a 10.5 as an option, which is a little bit of a bummer. Besides the sizing, these are cute and well made. The straps are a bit loose, but I assume that is because of the sizing being off a bit. The squared toe box really is so much more comfortable and still looks dressy enough that these can be worn to a formal event. Overall, I am happy with these shoes. I will definitely continue to wear them!",

                "reviewText": "I had high hopes for these shoes, but they have not delivered. For starters, they are too big. They even bend a little at the sides because there is too much shoe material. The shoe is not comfortable at all, either. The material is stiff and there is no support for the foot. My right foot has gone numb and my ankle has started to hurt while wearing these (which doesn't happen frequently with other shoes I wear). The look is okay. The material is smooth and the straps give it a fun design addition, but the okay look doesn't make up for the discomfort these shoes cause. I don't think I'll wear them much, which is disappointing.",
