I actually like this shoe so much I have it in gray as well. They hold up pretty well too. I\u2019ve had the gray pair for over a year, wear about 1-2x week, only spot cleaned, and they still look great. I always recommend this Brand to my friends and colleagues. Will definitely buy more in the future.",

Unfortunately, the insole is not as good quality as my previous pair. These are lightweight and were a little tight at first, but they have loosened up. The first day I wore them I walked around a large theme park for 10 hours and my feet did not hurt as much as if I wore other shoes. They don't show dirt which is nice, but I do have a snag in one after only wearing it for a month. The bottoms don\\t have much traction and can be slippery. Overall I like them.",

Fabric is not stretchy nor comfortable and shoe pinches at the width of the foot because of the overlapping seams stitched in that location. I got them for a vacation and they were adequate though uncomfortable. I really like the look of the shoe but wish they would make them out of a higher quality material so they would be comfortable.",

I figured it would go away, but by Day 5, they were still smelling like the Bog of Eternal Stench, and I decided to complain and return them the following day. Then I accidentally dropped a small can of crimson-orange paint (acrylic). It went all over them, and because that was my own fault, returning was no longer an option.I actually have a picture I am trying to share, but Amazon isn't letting me. It looks like I just murdered someone. (maybe I'll try again tomorrow)I hadn't bought myself a new pair of shoes in years. They are now my paint/art shoes (I refuse to waste them!).The fit was pretty comfortable for 9.5, though I have high arcs, and they don't offer much support in that area. They are flimsy, and the fabric snags easily, leaving frays. I bought these for $30 on Prime Day. It is now Black Friday and they are reduced in price again. DO NOT BUY! I can't believe some people pay the full price of $80!Back to the smell - it's almost as offensive as that of a dead body (which I have found one of before). I am not exaggerating on the strength of the smell. I have to store them in double-plastic-bags and only wear them when painting. Not even baking soda helped. It has been over a month, and the odor seems to be getting even stronger. And no, it's not my own feet, ha. It is only THIS pair of shoes!Not happy",
