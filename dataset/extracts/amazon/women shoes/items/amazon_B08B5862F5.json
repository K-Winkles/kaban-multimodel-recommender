                "reviewText": "Despite being branded as \u201carch fit\u201d these did almost nothing for my high arches. However they were pretty comfortable overall, and definitely better than the \u201cnon arch fit\u201d version that I also tried. I wore them on a two week walking trip of Europe and they held up pretty good for the 5+ miles a day we were walking on cobblestones, but I would have rather had something that I could have put an arch insert in I think. My calves got tired and I think a little ankle support would have been good for that kind of mileage. These are definitely good kick around town shoes, for running errands or doing chores or light activity like wandering a shopping street. But don\u2019t try to go distances in them or do any serious trails.Also, I probably recommend wearing socks with them. While they are breathable, the fabric gets smelly pretty fast and some places rub somewhat (the heel cup). Going to try washing them today to see if that resets the stink :)I love how easy they are to slip on - begone laces!!!",
