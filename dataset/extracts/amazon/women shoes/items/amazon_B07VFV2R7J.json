I wear and 8 1/2 Narrow shoe and it is so difficult to find a hiking shoe that works for me, if the shoe is too wide my foot slides around and I get shin splints and back pain. Even though these are labelled as medium width, they fit me perfectly. I purchased what is basically the same shoe 10 or 12 years ago, I wore them and wore them both for daily walks and hiking. Recently they just weren't usable anymore. I tried six other shoes and they were all too wide and didn't hold my feet securely enough for lots of walking. So excited to find I could buy basically the same shoe. They are sturdy and give my feet great support, I can lace them firmly enough that they give me the Narrow fit. Soles have ridges which grip the ground. I chose the Polar Wave color, pretty jazzy, I wonder what my adult children will think when they see their 71 year old mom wearing such a stylish shoe.",

I used to wear size 7 but I usually get a size 7.5 now for my own comfort. This has a good snug fit in the heel so it works well with my plantar fasciitis. My heel is very comfortable in it.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Expectations met After hiking in my Merrell Mids hiking boots past 2 years close to 300 miles on them I decided to stick with what I knew worked and fit me. And I\u2019m glad I did these couldn\u2019t be closer to what I expected from Merrell. Perfect for warmer weather on the trails Super flexible good traction light breathable material but yet enough protection and sturdy to be a good hikers not to mention stylish they have a wide toebox area and the heel part really hugs your heel (also helps keep out debris)if it wasn\u2019t for that it Kind of feels like I\u2019m wearing sandals hiking compared to my boots. they\u2019re so light. First hike in them was 7mi with creek crossing no problem just kept on hiking they hardly got wet on inside set them out with the early morning sun dry and like new within a hour they have a waterproof version but I figure since these are so light and are made out of mesh (mostly)some foam (heel area)they would dry super fast and they do no point in paying the $30 extra for waterproof.Only thing is where the tongue is sewed on underneath when you wear no socks the seams scratches you when putting on but don\u2019t after tounge is adjusted. And whatever that material is that overlays the mesh? It doesn\u2019t scruff or scratch easily and repels water. the mesh also repels water and debris. I would say unless you\u2019re going to submerge them they\u2019re pretty water resistant nothing is waterproof. They\u2019re made small so I\u2019d say stick to the same size if you own Merrells and you don\u2019t plan on wearing thick socks. if you don\u2019t have Merrells go up a half size than what you usually are. For 90 bucks I\u2019m very happy with them I\u2019m going to put them through a lot the next couple years and I am sure they they\u2019re going to hold up just as much. I\u2019ll add pics soon!Update! Here\u2019s pics and a motion sickness video\ud83d\ude09 of first hike In review.Have done about 55 more miles still nothing wrong I would have more pics of them a little more beaten up and used but they\u2019re in the car that\u2019s where they live!Update October 2023OK so after breaking them in good, with about 100 miles on them now. And I had hoped to get a couple hundred more out of them, which is not going to happen, hoped to use them to start trail running in this fall that is not going to happen either. They just are not holding up .I can only get 4-5 miles in them before they start hurting my feet! Had I have gotten a bigger size maybe I could\u2019ve had room for a gel insole. That would defeat the purpose of what I was looking for. Where as my Merrill mids boots I can still do 16 miles in them still easy! Maybe Merrill should just stick to boots.",

                "reviewText": "Great shoe. Merrell never disappoints. Great quality make! Shoe laces are well made and constructed to prevent unlacing (laces are always a key issue for me for longevity and unlacing while walking). Soles are well made, rugged for hiking, and appear to be made to last. The shoe insole is comfortable and is ready for long term walking. Took it out for a 5K hike today and no problems with heels.",
