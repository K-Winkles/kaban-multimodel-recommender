Made from extra-soft black leather or synthetic animal print, the may marigold has stretch gore, fabric linings, ortholite footbed, tpr outsoles, and sculpted low heel. This women's shoe from the clarks collection defines easy wear ability. Slip it day or night on to add a cute finishing touch to jeans, skirts, or pants.How to measure your foot:Place your foot on a flat surface with your heel against a straight edge. Place a ruler beside your foot touching the straight edge your heel is also touching, then take the length in millimetres from the tip of your longest toe to your heel. Please be aware that your longest toe may not always be your big toe. From its humble beginnings in 1825 in the tiny English village of Street, Somerset, to a global company that manufactures and markets close to 35 million pairs of shoes a year, Clarks' commitment to comfort, quality, authenticity, and individual style has remained unchanged throughout the centuries.",

They are sleek and stylish, great to wear with either dressy slacks or casual jeans. A bit of a wedge heel to give your calves a little work-out (I am 81 and need to challenge myself!). Cushiony, soft, and nice support.Ordered my customary size 10M. Right foot is perfect, left a bit loose. Don't know if it's my foot or the shoe. They will be fine in winter weather with a thicker pair of trouser hose.Thanks, Amazon, for carrying a wide assortment of Clark's at affordable prices. This is my third order, each a different style. I am sure I will order again.",

I had to return them and order a size smaller. What I am saying is that the shoe is small to size. I had to order a size smaller than I normally wear. The quality is excellent and they are SO comfortable to wear to work. I highly recommend these shoes.",
