I\u2019ve had them a week or so and have been worn them most of those days. The first day I wore them I thought I was gonna have a problem because the back of one shoe was rubbing the back of my ankle with my no-show socks. However the next day when I wore them the shoe didn\u2019t rub and I haven\u2019t had the problem. I guess I just had to break them in.I got the purple color and they look dope. I was joking that they were my mom shoes and my friends were like no those are nice and I was wondering where you got them. There\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ll get another color in the future and see if I can find a variation in style.Durability - again I can\u2019t really speak to the long term. Do I think they will last as long as my Air Force 1s or a pair of Timberlands? Of course not. But are these more comfortable than I thought they\u2019d be and look good for the price? Yep.Enjoy.",

So I got them, not too expensive, cute & looked like something I could wear all day.. I work in a pharmacy, so on my feet all day.They looked like they maybe have cushion, bounce to them... they do not. The bottom is hard. They didn't really hurt my feet the 1st week... but not like walking ok a cloud, either. The 2nd week, a little pain on some days, but still not Terrible.. just still not what I was expecting.So far the quality is good, nothing wrong with them that I can tell.They do lace up, but the shoe is 1 piece in its entirety, might be harder to tighten if you have really small feet.Also, I wear a 9 1/2 to 10 in women & these fit me perfectly.",
