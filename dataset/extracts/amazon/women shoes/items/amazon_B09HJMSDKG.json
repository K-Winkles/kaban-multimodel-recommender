                "reviewText": "I bought these 1.5 years ago and still love them! So much so that I\u2019m looking at buying them again. I still get questions on whether they\u2019re brand new as they\u2019re still so white. They don\u2019t dirty easily, which is amazing for white shoes. I wear them to walk paved trails, typically 1-3 miles and they hold up well, my feet feel cushioned, and they\u2019re breathable. I also love that the back of the shoe is well cushioned so no blisters or rubbing on the back of your ankles. I haven\u2019t had issues with the insoles but I\u2019m also not running in them (light jogging or quick sprints on a treadmill here and there). I have noticed that if I wear them around my house that my arches start to hurt. But walking in them doesn\u2019t bother me. My only complaint is that I purchased these in July \u201822 for under $40 and now they\u2019re $60. Different seller, but older model shoe. But I guess when the shoe fits, it\u2019s worth it!(Pics are present day, 1.5 years after purchase to show how well they\u2019ve held up). Adidas runs large so make sure to size down at last half a size. I\u2019m typically a 9 in most shoes but have always gotten 8.5 in adidas.",

They're nicely padded, and my favorite part is that the tail behind the heel is ALSO HEAVILY PADDED so you don't have to go through the pain of endless heel blisters that comes with breaking in new shoes. Also, they're hella cute! I get so many compliments on these, and one coworker even (jokingly) threatened to steal them off of my feet. My job involves walking around on concrete floors for the entirety of my 8-hour shift, but with these shoes my feet never feel sore. My only complaint is that Adidas sizing is weird, so I recommend using their sizing chart before buying any of their shoes.",

I probably should\u2019ve ordered a 7 or a 7.5. I will be returning and not repurchasing because of this issue. Too wide & not sure what size would fit properly. They do have some arch support, but not enough for me. They\u2019re also pretty wide as well. They seem like pretty decent quality, but I can\u2019t speak to performance or long term quality or comfort.",
