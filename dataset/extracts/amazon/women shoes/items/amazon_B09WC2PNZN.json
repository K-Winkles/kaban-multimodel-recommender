                "reviewText": "These shoes are decent walking shoes. I would not suggest for long shifts or anything over 4 miles. I found they are so comfortable for going to the store, or yard work. Be forewarned though, anything longer than 90 minutes it felt like the foam went away and my ankles were not supported. The bottom of my feet were sensitive after my 6 mile walk and I got a shin splint. I thought this was a fluke and tried it again a few weeks later but the same issues came up. The heal area is lacking any rigidity, so maybe that is why my ankles felt weak. The soles of the shoe seem to deteriorate pretty quick too (as you can see in the picture with only 12 miles on them). Not a bad shoe though for the price",
