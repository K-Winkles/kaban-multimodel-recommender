                "reviewText": "I chose these because several of my coworkers enjoy wearing these. Working in the airline industry, heels are smiled upon. Typically I don't wear heels for a couple reasons: 1.) Im a tall girl already and don't like towering over people. 2.) I have bunions and heels hurt me normallyThe first couple of times I wore these shoes the balls of my feet hurt considerably. However around the 3rd time of usage they finally 'broke in' and I can now wear these all day, very comfortably too.",

                "reviewText": "These shoes fit like they were made for me, everything from the exact length and width of my foot, even had a good heel fit which you don't always get with the wider width. They are super attractive, leather is soft, love the cuban heel, I sometimes have balance issues, but these are very stable and soles are quiet. My only issue and I know these will stretch a bit since they are leather, is the area over the toes is just every so lightly tight, but just wore them around the house for a bit and they were starting to get to the shape of my forefoot. These are not cheap shoes, but they are the best shoes I've ever had, always go for Clark's if I can find them. Excellent buy and would recommend.",
