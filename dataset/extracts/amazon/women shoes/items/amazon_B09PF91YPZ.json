My feet are two sizes, one is 7.5 and the other 8. I got the smaller since they are true leather and will likely stretch out. The best part is the complements I get!",

I bought these for a Halloween costume and was concerned that I would have to change into something else because I would be on my feet all night. To my surprise, I never even felt them on my feet! I was a little worried about getting my normal size after reading some of the reviews about needing a half size up, but going with my normal size was perfect. I suggest if you have wider toes, then go half a size up, because the toe is a little narrow. I also suggest wearing them a little bit around the house a day or two before to sort of break them in before wearing them in all day! Other than that I absolutely loved them!",

There used to be a \u201ccombination\u2019 fit for shoes with narrow heels, but never in loafers. That said, Clark shoes are my go to and 9.5s always fit!",
