Here's the issue, the heel being brown shows up every little mark especially if you drive wearing them, the heel is coming away from the base they are definitely not ideal for wet weather showing water stains I've worn them a few times loved them until I noticed how bad the brown heel looks now I can't wear them at all, such a waste since I only brought them 2 months ago.",

                "reviewText": "Love these booties! Plenty wide for my wide feet and they actually seem to hide bunions. So often real leather will stretch and conform to the shape of your foot. For me that means a \"bump\" sticking out on the side of my foot, just below my big toe. These boots stayed true to their original shape.Super cute with slim leg slacks for work or a tunic and leggings. Slightly too wide in the heel but I have that problem nearly all shoes so it probably just me. I've gotten lots of compliments. I have been wearing to work daily for nearly a month and so far so good. Glad to have found a super cute bootie for my wide feet.**Update**It's been about 6 months of wearing daily at work (office setting mostly) and I am still in love with these boots! A little wear starting to show in the bottom of the heal, to be expected. The zipper is still in working order and the leather looks as new as the day I got them. They wipe clean with a damp cloth if you get a little dirt on them. They are still incredibly comfortable and cute. I've worn them with skinny pants, trouser pants, wide leg jeans, even cute with a tunic dress...they look good with everything!Sadly, just now when I tried to order again, they are unavailable \ud83d\ude2d. I hate that!",
