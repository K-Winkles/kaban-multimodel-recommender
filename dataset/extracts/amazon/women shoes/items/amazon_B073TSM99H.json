Perfect for travel as they slip on and off easily and are versatile with many outfits. I\u2019m collecting all the colors and love them each. If you\u2019re looking for a cute, comfortable, quality shoe I encourage you to give these a try. The sizing is generous and they stretch out a little with wear so I would stay true to size or size down if you\u2019re in between sizing.",

They are a casual shoe. They look good with jeans or shorts. The sole is a drivers type but you don\u2019t feel it. I may have to order another. Good price. Good shoe.",

They are just casual enough, And they are soft and very comfortable. I live in Florida where sandals generally rule.. When it gets a little cooler out they're just the perfect alternative. I took the suggestion to size down a half size.. I was skeptical because I am generally a full size 11. That was the right call as they may stretch a little but they fit perfectly from the day I got them.",

These worked great for me. This new beige pair are lovely and again very comfortable. For some reason are a bit larger than previous pair. I wore them anyway even tho my heel kept coming out. The reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the lacing on the side came apart while i was on vacation. The other black pair have held up beautifully so this must be a fluke. I still recommend these shoes for style and comfort. Too late to return the new pair, but still love the shoe.",
