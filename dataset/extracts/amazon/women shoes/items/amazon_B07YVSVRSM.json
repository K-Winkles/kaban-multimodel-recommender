I climbed lots of stairs and hills with steep inclines/declines. I\u2019m happy to say my feet survived! I always wore little no-show socks, as I don\u2019t like to go without.These shoes are so versatile I was able to wear them with dresses, leggings, and jeans. I felt cute and comfy. My one piece of advice is to break them in a little. They were tight on first wear and my feet felt a bit trapped during an 8 hour flight, but otherwise, no complaints.",

I was able to purchase the last two pair Amazon had in stock which made me a very happy camper. These shoes are pretty heavy but my feet didn't seem to mind. Shoes are well made and fit perfectly without any rubbing anywhere. I have bought more shoes in this style and, for the most part they have fit the same way with the exception of a couple pair which are very tight. I think they will probably loosen as I wear them. Recommend these Dr. Scholl's shoes. I am happy with this purchase.",

I got the white snakeskin pair and really think they look very nice. I usually wear a size 10. ordered that and they were too big. Amazon helped make the replacement for the next smaller size effortless. Thank you, Amazon. I have narrow feet and these don't fit as snug as I would wish for the width but they don't gap. My heels don't slip. These are very easy to slip on and I can wear them with jeans or with nicer pants/skirt. Glad I got these.",

Work in a restaurant kitchen and live in the country.I bought these because of the amount of cushion.I bought them Sept 2,2023.Today is Nov 7, 2023. So I have had them 61 days.The shoe was snug at first wear, but not unbearable.My disappointment comes in after 61 DAYS of wearing them, I\u2019ve already had to add an insult insert to return to the original comfort cushion and I noticed the site is cracking at the ball of the foot.I had hoped to at LEAST get 6 months of wear before having to start replacing insoles and a YEAR before having to replace the shoe completely.I\u2019m only walking in them, not running out heavy outside work in them",
