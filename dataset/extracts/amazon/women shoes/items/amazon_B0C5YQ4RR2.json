Will be buying more when they go back on sale for sure . These are great for anyone who hates heavy clunky shoes. My only issue is the fact that they suck up even the slightest wetness or water if you\u2019re out on a rainy day, so they are great for dry fall days but not wintertime or rainy days!",
