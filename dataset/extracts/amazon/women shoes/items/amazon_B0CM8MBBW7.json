                "reviewText": "I ordered these DREAM PAIRS shoes in a black size 11 for my wife and was pleased and relieved that it fit her so nicely. These will replace a couple of older pairs which have been great but are just too tired to look nor feel nice any longer. The slip on Mary Jane style works out best for her so I was very happy that these will fit her long and slender feet so well. Shoe shopping isn't something that I normally want to do with her on a \"date night out\" because shoe fitment becomes too problematic and just becomes frustrating for me. She is never thrilled with that experience either. It was with a large bit of trepidation that I even ordered these shoes for her, especially without asking her permission. I just knew that she needed new ones and this style has been the best with recent (?) acquisitions. She wears orthotics in most of her shoes now but tries to avoid doing so with her dress shoes which are worn at least weekly, and mostly for Church. She likes the Mary Jane flats style because she is the congregational organist and can play the organ with it's foot pedals without changing or removing her shoes to do so. The hook and loop fastener strap is nice in slipping these on, although it doesn't really offer much adjustability. It is simply one nice feature to enjoy as part of the whole. Her feet are quite long but also narrow and it is difficult to find shoes that fit nicely, with room for the length but which aren't loose or sloppy across her toes or in the heel. The cut on these Mary Jane's seem to fit that long slender foot quite well. These shoes are fully lined. Behind the strap the lining is a thin leather look material with a fabric heel wrap. In front of the strap the toe box is lined with a very fine weave fabric. All of the shoe and lining seams are finished smoothly, both inside and outside. I do not feel any stiff or rigid seam junctions and there is nothing that would irritate a wearers foot. The lining is smooth enough that these could be worn comfortably without stockings if desired. The molded foam insole is quite thick for this style of shoes, about 4.5mm (3/16 inch) and with a \"nice lively rebound\" which is what you want for good insole life and comfort. Do not be FOOLED by advertisements for memory foam in shoes. The insole is NOT the place you want low rebound memory foam. It feels great when you first touch it but after just a little use the cushion you expect it will provide your feet does not exist. It is dead to rebound, and unfortunately after just a little actual use your feet will be suffering because there is no effective cushion in that shoe. These insoles have good rebound and cushion which they should still have 6 months from now. Comfort is forever, and much better than the opposing misery. The sole of these shoes is a molded, semi-rigid TPR or rubber with a nice pattern of shallow tread groves added in. These appear to be slip resistant, at least when wet as they don't become slippery like some materials I have experienced. I am also sure that the tread design adds to the gripping ability as you sprint across the kitchen. Now that's dreaming!",

                "reviewText": "I love these shoes. They are so soft, flexible and comfortable. I have a few issues with my feet which can make hunting for good fitting and comfortable walking shoes a difficult find. My left foot is a bit smaller and my right ankle a bit larger because it was shattered a couple of years ago, and I was left with an ankle full of nuts, bolts, screws, plates and rods. Finding shoes that fit good and are comfortable to wear have been a challenge. These shoes fit perfectly right out of the box. That does not happen very often. I wear a 10 medium and these were perfect. I just has to bend the right one a little and stretch it a tiny bit, and it went on to fit like a glove. The sole/bed fit my feet perfectly. They were not tight and they did not rub or pinch my feel. They are so comfortable and stayed comfortable even after wearing them all day and doing quite a bit of walking. They have the traditional Mary Jane strap that comes across the top of the foot at an angle, which can be securely fastened across each foot, holding them gently but firmly in place. I must have shoes that are a good fit and do not slide around on my feet. They have to be comfortably snug but not too tight or lose. I have enough room to wiggle my toes and there are no pressure points or pinching. There is enough space at the front to allow for natural foot movement. The strap across the top of the foot is adjustable and can be cinched up or loosened as needed. This is good for me with my foot issues. I like feeling that my shoes are on, not loose on my feet and that gives me a feeling of security and stability when walking. I wore them with socks only because it is winter, and I wanted to have a nice, warm, comfy place for my feet.",

Although the shoe size fit perfectly, the strap did not allow for tightening any further, and the strap was extremely loose.",

I am a little larger than a 10, so often find I need to order an 11 (because almost no one makes a 10.5), but I really wish I had gone for the 10 in these. I have slightly narrow feet, and they fit me well in the actual width, but they are a little deeper than they need to be on my feet, so they are a bit loose with regular light socks I would normally wear in dress shoes. With thicker casual socks to take up space, they fit better. It would be nice if the strap had more room for adjustment, as that would help with the fit, but although you can make them a little looser, you don't really have room on the strap to make them tighter. Even with the thick socks, I can still slide my feet out without loosening the strap.So order to size, and if your feet are very narrow then you might need to add an insole or heel grippers. But they are really very soft and flexible, very comfortable to wear. I like them enough I'm going to add things to help them fit better, because I think these will be great office shoes.",

Being completely synthetic makes these not very breathable, but would work well in cooler temperatures.The pair I ordered are navy blue and the colour is consistent with no void spots or variation across the pair.The soles have decent treads.The width is average to very slightly wide. The strap closure uses hook and loop, which makes them easy to close and keep on.I feel that these would work well with a skirt or dress pants. In my view, the strap makes them less dressy than a strapless shoe, but having a strap does make them stay on.For me, this shoe would likely work well for someone who needed a secure fit, with good walking treads (for a formal shoe).",
