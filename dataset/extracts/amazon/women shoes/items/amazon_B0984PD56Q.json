                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Brooks Women's Adrenaline GTS 22 for my daughter, and I must say, these running shoes are a game-changer in every sense. From their supportive design to their energizing performance, they have become my go-to companion for the miles ahead.Pros:Exceptional Support:The Adrenaline GTS 22 lives up to its name, providing unparalleled support that caters to every stride. The holistic support system keeps my feet stable, offering the ideal balance between cushioning and responsiveness.Adaptive Fit:The adaptive fit of these shoes is a standout feature. The 3D Fit Print technology molds the shoe to the contours of my foot, creating a personalized and snug fit. It's like they were tailor-made for my runs.Smooth Transition:The GuideRails technology ensures a smooth and effortless transition from heel to toe. It not only enhances stability but also reduces any excess movement, promoting a more efficient and comfortable running experience.Energetic Cushioning:The DNA LOFT and BioMoGo DNA cushioning combination is a stroke of genius. It provides the perfect blend of softness and responsiveness, absorbing impact while propelling me forward with every step. It's like running on clouds without sacrificing performance.Durable Construction:Brooks has nailed durability with the Adrenaline GTS 22. The shoes withstand the rigors of my regular runs, maintaining their structural integrity even after logging substantial mileage. This durability speaks volumes about the quality of craftsmanship.Cons:Slightly Pricey:While the Adrenaline GTS 22 is an investment in performance, the price point may be a bit steep for some. However, the quality and longevity of these shoes make them well worth the investment for serious runners.Limited Color Options:The available color options might not cater to everyone's preferences. A broader range of color choices would add a touch of personalization to these outstanding running shoes.In conclusion, the Brooks Women's Adrenaline GTS 22 has redefined my running experience. These shoes not only meet but exceed the expectations of a supportive running companion. From the adaptive fit to the energetic cushioning, every feature contributes to an inspiring and comfortable run.

                "reviewText": "I bought these as a replacement for my previous Brooks that I bought at a local store versus online. These were perfect for me as it's hard to find shoes that actually fit properly on my feet. I have extra wide feet and plantar fasciitis, so most shoes are miserable and tight in the toe box for me. These were a good price and fit exactly as my previous pair. The price was also great on Amazon. My only dislike is that the shoestrings seems a bit short but I can easily replace those with longer if it bothers me too much. Otherwise, I love these shoes and would buy again when the time comes. My last pair lasted three years with walking, running, and even all day wear at times. So comfortable. I would absolutely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these to use while walking on my walking pad, and they work great. They're comfortable, lightweight, and breathable. They're also easy to get on and off and quite attractive. The padding makes it feel like you are walking on clouds! They also do not force your foot into the toe box and squish your toes and make them rub, which is wonderful!However, if you have flat feet, you will need to get insoles for these as they do not have quite enough arch support. It's not a huge deal, but just slightly annoying - it's totally worth it for the joy of the 99.9% of the shoe.Overall, these are great for walkers too - they are comfortable, breathable, and attractive.",

I think the padding must be naturally curved but it didn\u2019t fit well to my feet which are not wide. The shoe is more light weight than the ghost I had but the insole seemed a bit more comfy in the other shoes. These shoe though kinda catapult you up as you walk which is kinda good.",

That same area in the 22's fits great, no issues. The color is a little lighter in person, like a fading pale pink, but they get lots of compliments. I'm Brooks for life. The toe box has great room compared to other brands, and fits pretty true to size. I usually wear size 8 or 8.5 US, or EU 39. If I can go by EU size, it's usually spot on compared to US sizes. These have just the right amount of support, but not as much cushion/squish as Ghost or Glycerin.",
