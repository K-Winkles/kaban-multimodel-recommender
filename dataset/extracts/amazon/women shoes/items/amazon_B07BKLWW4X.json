I first got these shoes at Academy on sale and oh man these are worth the higher cost for me.These are so incredibly comfortable that when my first pair was wearing out, I got a second pair right here on Amazon, so this review is technically for my second pair (although they are identical to the first, so it's really for both).These are so soft and so lightweight but are so sturdy! My first pair only finally started wearing out in the sole under my toe pads after like 3 years. I used them for everything; errands, walking around town, exercising, going to amusement parks, the whole nine yards. These shoes survived a 3-day trip to Disneyland Paris, including walking around London a few days after. They also survived a cruise with offroad excursions followed by 3 days at Disneyland in California.They have never been a cause of blisters, they flex and form with my feet without feeling too tight or restrictive. I don't know what magic Sketchers uses, but I adore these shoes and plan to keep buying them for as long as they'll make them.Oh and the best part is they just slip, maybe hook a finger at the heel to help slip it over.They run a bit small, historically I'm a 9 1/2 wide (women's), but I buy these in 11 and they fit perfectly.",

Her previous pair lasted a long time, but the bottom treads had worn out and I was worried about her slipping in wet or icy weather. The sizing was appropriate (she is typically a 9 or 9.5) and these fit well, were comfortable, and seem to provide good support. Very good pricing and I'm confident they'll last for a long time. Next time, I'm considering looking for a slip-on version of Skechers for her, as I've heard positive things about them, overall.",

The back of the sneaker is also very snug, so it sort of pushes your foot forward into the toe box and makes it rub against the tip of the shoe, which is annoying at best and painful at worst if you're wearing them for a longer time.They are lightweight and relatively easy to slide on and off. The color is also attractive. They also work well on a treadmill, which is nice.Ultimately, these are not the best Sketchers that I've had, and I returned them - the weird way that they pushed your foot toward the toe and made it rub was just not tolerable for me.",
