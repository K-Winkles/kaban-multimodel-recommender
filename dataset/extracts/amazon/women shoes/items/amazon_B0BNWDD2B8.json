                "reviewText": "Real leather! My 66 year old feet complete with a couple pairs of slightly webbed toes are not those of a model and never have been. (Only PT Barnum might think otherwise.)I hate shoe shopping but Amazon makes it easy with reviews and easy returns. I finally found the perfect shoes for my quirky feet! A high toe box for my up-turned big toes, extra width for the toes and a taylor's bunion, nice padding and arch for my sometimes achy feet, and comfortable heel height. Clark's are my new favs after years of putting up with shallow toe boxes, poor sole support and shoes rubbing my feet the wrong way, causing callouses and tired feet! I now have happy feet! Amazon, please keep stocking Clark's shoes and boots!",

As soon as I took these Carleighs out of the box, I could tell they were not a real wide shoe. The shoe was comfortable except for the width. Both shoes hurt my small toes. I had to return.
