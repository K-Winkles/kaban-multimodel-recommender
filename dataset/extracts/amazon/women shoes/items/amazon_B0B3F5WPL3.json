                "reviewText": "So after many years waiting for the Dr. Scholl\u2019s comfort to return to the insoles, this shoe was everything I was hoping for until day 3! The comfort and style was perfect for back to school as a teacher. Got so many compliments. Then the top part of the shoe started to separate from the edge of the seam!! Disappointed with the quality! I used to be able to wear my Dr. Scholl\u2019s a whole school year!",

I wouldn't complain if they were cheap but they do cost a good bit. They are comfortable but now I have one show splitting apart. I would love to send them back or get a partial refund but I don't see that option. I doubt I will buy clothes or shoes from an Amazon seller again.",

My feet usually hurt when I wear this type of slip on sneaker, but the arch support of these is incredible. Great for a casual work outfit or running out for errands!",
