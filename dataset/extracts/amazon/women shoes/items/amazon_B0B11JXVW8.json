                "reviewText": "I bought these after a lot of indecision lol. I needed light colored shoes to match a dress that wouldn\u2019t go with my black heels. I poured over Amazon reviews for several pairs and then ended up getting these mostly because they would arrive sooner lol.I am *so glad* I did. These may be the most comfortable heels I\u2019ve ever worn. I love heels and heeled boots because I have flat feet and having at least a little bit of a heel actually helps me have less foot pain and fatigue. I wear heeled Chelsea boots from Target basically every single day lol. My black heels I\u2019ve had forever and kinda hate. They are a chunky heel like this one, and even a similar Mary Jane shape - but they always hurt my feet. I think the difference is the shape. The black heels I own (and have worn for 16 hours before at a work conference) have more of a \u201cstandard\u201d heel arch where the chunky heel goes almost diagonally down to the ball of the foot. These heels (which I got in the beige/white color) are less of a drastic slope with the ball of the foot having more surface area and the heel being even a little bit chunkier. I genuinely felt like I was wearing boots or even sneakers in these. I had no foot pain even after walking home from my event in rainy weather and going to a last minute late night dinner with friends where we had to stand around the bar for about an hour while waiting for a table. I even walked my dog when I got home without changing my shoes.I really liked the shape also because it felt a little \u201c90\u2019s does 60\u2019s\u201d lol. I think they\u2019d look great (and be comfy) for a costume also - but are simple and stylish enough that they don\u2019t actually *look* costume-y like the heels you buy at a Halloween store lol.I bought a 7.5 and would say they fit correctly for size. I am usually a 7.5/7.5 Wide and these fit like a dream. No wiggling or sliding forward. I was a little nervous the strap wouldn\u2019t look cute once I tightened it (cause some shoes in the past have given me a weird puffy look at the strap) but it didn\u2019t at all.The *only* thing is - because these are patent - they scuff like the dickens. I tried them on the night I got them and got a small scuff on them that I buffed out with an eraser. But when I got home from my evening after wearing them out - they are pretty scuffed up. Personally, I would probably still wear them with the scuffs because I doubt they\u2019ll be super noticeable while walking around or sitting at dinner or something. But I am going to see if I can clear the scuffs and maybe find something to help prevent it from happening in the future. I assume this is a problem more so for these lighter ones - black or dark brown ones I doubt would show the scuffs so easily.",

                "reviewText": "TL;DR: Before wearing, apply moleskin to the sides of your feet and back of your feet. Buy shoe inserts you can cut to fit the heels.I chose these shoes because I wanted to wear heels at an anime convention, and these have thicker heels which are more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. They are super adorable and got compliments, I liked them enough I wore them out the next day despite my bleeding, aching feet. The color was very bright red. Unfortunately, the other reviews are correct in that these shoes scuff incredibly easily. :\\ Guess that\u2019s just what happens when you buy this type of material at this price point.I\u2019m not sure how to rate the pain I experienced in them since (1) I wore them longer than you\u2019re supposed to I imagine, (2) I\u2019m not used to wearing heels, (3) my moleskin fell off and I couldn\u2019t find shoe inserts. In order for them to not cause bleeding or pain you will need to use A LOT of moleskin and find shoe inserts that you can cut to fit into your shoes. They definitely hurt less than skinnier heels, but caused bleeding on the back of my feet and rubbed the sides raw to the point the skin needs to grow back. The balls of my feet hurt the most, outside of the pain from a lack of moleskin protecting me. The next day, I properly applied moleskin and it didn\u2019t hurt in the places it previously caused me to bleed or rubbed my skin raw. I don\u2019t think heels should make you bleed but I also don\u2019t think this is super uncommon for heels in general, so overall I think these shoes aren\u2019t bad. The scuffing sucks, though.",
