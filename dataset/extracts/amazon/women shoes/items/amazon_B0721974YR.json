                "reviewText": "Short Review: Go Walk Joy is the top winner of all the shoes/Skechers I've destroyed.They are relaxed fit, so it depends on how you want it to fit. If you want a tighter, fitted feeling, go half a size down, the length is still there. But if you order your regular size, you should be fine, even with thick socks. The arch support is \"natural\" since it's got a memory foam insole, but if you need more support, I recommend the D'Lites or the Air Cooled Arch-Fit.Long Review: I struggle with buying shoes online, so I ran some experiments over the last couple of years. Keep in mind I do no less than 50,000 steps a week. I'm on my feet up to 10 hours a day for work. So, here are reviews for multiple styles of Skechers.First, I bought the Go Walk Joy Walking Shoe Sneaker (slip on, no laces) in a size 8.5 which is what I normally buy in a sneaker. It's a relaxed fit shoe so it fit better with socks. They were an absolute miracle shoe. All of my foot pain was gone on day 1, and there was no breaking in period. There is also plenty of side room in both shoes, so if they're out of the wide, just try it anyway in your regular size. I think you'll be happy.I wore those out in about 3 months.I googled how to make shoes last longer, and decided to order 2 more pairs and wear them on alternating days, just to see if I could get 6 months out of them that way. I did not. After 4 months, I replaced the insoles altogether, and by the end of the 5th month, the soles themselves had lost all support. I pressed on. I didn't want to give them up... I ended up injuring my arches because of it. Those shoes were size 8 and size 8.5. The 8 was a perfect fit where the 8.5 was a bit roomy. If you like a lot of toe space, go with the 8.5, but the 8's should do you fine, even if you normally wear an 8.5 (as all my other store bought shoes are 8.5).While my arches were healing, I ordered this pair of Skechers Go Walk Joy 15601 Shoe in a size 8 (based off my previous go walk experience), with HIGH expectations. In the size department, again, perfect fit. But due to the damage I did to my arch, I couldn't wear them.I found the Skecher's D'Lites Play-On Sneaker, here, on Amazon, as well. They are not relaxed fit, so I ordered the 8.5. I have trouble with any type of heel usually, but these were pretty much perfect for protecting my arch. They are a little bit tight on me, as they are not relaxed fit, and I think I would have done well with a size 9.Because of that sizing, I decided I should go to an actual shoe store and try them on in person. The store didn't carry the D'Lites, but they did have these exact 15601 Shoes, and their size 8 was much smaller than the shoe I was wearing... I would swear it was a 7, but I can't explain that. They were otherwise identical. They didn't actually have a larger size for me to compare it to. It confuses me more, but I have to assume one of them is a mis-label, and I don't think it's Amazon (again, based on past purchases of other Go Walk varieties)Anyway, slightly off track there. They did not have any D'Lites in stock, but they did have an Air-Cooled Arch Fit shoe. In the moment, they were definitely more comfortable than the Go Walk. I bought the Arch Fit in a size 8.5 at the store.The plan was to alternate every few days with the D'Lites and the Arch Fit, and this worked for a while, but once my arches were healed, the problems I have with \"heels\" came back, so in a desperate moment, I put the 15601's back on and went to work, fully believing I'd be in pain by the end of the day. But I wasn't! They are the awesome shoe I was expecting! I did decide to pick up a $2 pair of cheap foam insoles to add to them, just for extra cushion. I'm going to replace those once a month, placing them on top of the original insoles rather than replacing the original insoles, just to see if it helps extend the life of the shoe. I'm just about due, so I pulled them out and put the shoes on to see if it's helped. So far it seems like it's working. I'd love to get more than 3 months out of them, but I think it's worth the money either way.Go Walk has truly been a Joy. I'll be buying more of them, as well as other Go Walk variety of shoes. And I HIGHLY recommend the D'Lites and the Arch Fit lines for anyone with arch issues. They were amazing when I needed them. I still wear them, just not to work or anywhere I need to stand for long periods of time. Heck, I still wear the first 3 pairs of Go Walk Joy around the house and when running errands. They look brand new on the outside! And as long as I don't have them on for more than a few hours, they're perfectly fine with any cheap replacement insole.All that said, if you're on a budget, I also still love my SlowMan Air Cushioned Walking Sneaker (women's slip on, sold here on Amazon). When I initially felt the problems in my arches, I pulled them out of the closet (after nearly 2 years) and the arch support was amazing. They also align with these size comparisons. I bought them in a size 8 and an 8.5. The 8 fit better, the 8.5 allowed for thicker socks. The heel though, again, is too high for me in general, but they really are comfortable otherwise. They are less expensive and a good alternative to the Arch Support varieties of Skechers.If you made it this far, I hope I was helpful! I'm always afraid of buying shoes online, because I HATE returning things.",

                "reviewText": "Okay so this is definitely the best purchase I\u2019ve made this year. Fair warning, long review coming up because I do it for the girlies who are worried about online shoe shopping. I\u2019ll start with sizing: I have slightly wider feet and after reading reviews I was in between the regular and wide size. I ended up getting the wide ones and I could have definitely gotten away with the regular size. They are very roomy but that\u2019s completely fine with me since my feet tend to swell a bit in the heat and I like not having to worry about ingrown nails. The extra space also didn\u2019t cause any discomfort or additional friction. If you have narrow feet definitely stick to the regular size but if you\u2019re somewhere in between then you have the ability to choose. I\u2019ll definitely be getting a wide size again, based on my next experience. Originally, I wanted to get comfortable shoes I could wear to my job as a makeup artist where I\u2019m standing all day. I finally ended up buying these as I had a convention to go to and that\u2019s where I broke these in. They are SO comfortable!! Two days of walking all over the place and my feet didn\u2019t hurt til the end of day 2! Of course there was some soreness but it was nothing compared to wearing boots or other sneakers. The next time I wore them was for a theme park where we got absolutely poured on for three hours. I was a bit bummed out because I thought my new shoes had gone to waste quickly but NOPE. These babies dry up SO QUICKLY. At the end of the night it was my wet socks that were the death of me, not the shoes. I left them to dry for a couple days and when I wore them again the sole was still intact. It wasn\u2019t as squishy as it used to be of course, but still very comfortable! These are very breathable and dry up within an hour. Keep in mind I live in FL, where it\u2019s been pouring rain everyday and I\u2019ve had to stomp my way through flooded puddles. Thanks to these shoes I don\u2019t have to worry about my feet becoming stinky around clients after the rain and my toes don\u2019t get blisters thanks to the width. One thing I will say is that the bottoms of the shoes peeled like crazy after that first rainfall but they haven\u2019t become slippery at all. It\u2019s only noticeable when you look directly at the bottom but no one will tell when you\u2019re out and about on your feet. The next thing I\u2019ll quickly touch on are looks. I\u2019m in my early 20s and was worried about how these would impact my style but they work with everything! I got the all black shoes and tend to wear mostly black anyway but I definitely don\u2019t lose any of my aesthetic when I wear them. Overall, I 1000% recommend these but just be mindful that the soles might lose their cushion after standing in pouring rain for a couple of hours. This probably isn\u2019t much of an issue if you live in a dry area but if you ever come across it, I\u2019m sure you can throw in some other insoles and be fine. Again, the shoe itself is super breathable so I\u2019d never toss them over the soles. I\u2019m going to purchase another pair soon to wear outside of work, they\u2019re cute and comfy! I hope this helped someone out!!",

Everyone has that one item that they buy multiples of, because they don't want to run out of them... for me, it's this shoe. Working retail like jobs meant I needed a shoe that was comfortable but could also carry my weight for long periods of time. This shoe does both. It's also a great walking around town shoe. Even after I left the job, I kept the shoe but it was cute, comfortable, and let my foot breathe with it's lightweight mesh top. I have moderately flat feet but the arch on this shoe was just right, a slight arch but not too much. And it comes in wide sizes, another plus. Great shoe.",
