They would either be able to be dressed up for special occasions or down for everyday looks.They fit true to size for me. They aren't narrow or wide. They don't seem to have any additional arch support but fit the way your average flats do. Overall, they are comfortable.The reason for four stars instead of five is because the toe box is very short which makes my foot look much longer than it is. You also can see the very start of my toes because the toe box is that short. I don't think it's too noticeable unless you are really eyeing it up though so I will definitely still wear them.",

                "reviewText": "These are really basic flats. They are a bit narrow, so if you have wide feet, these may get uncomfortable after a while. They definitely felt a bit tighter than I expected. I'd say because of the narrowness, they also feel a bit tight length wise. Overall, they are cute, basic flats. They don't have a ton of arch support or anything, similar to most flats I own. These would be great to keep at the office or in the car as a backup pair of shoes. They can be dressed up or down. I can see myself pairing these with a cute sundress or a pair of jean capris and top.",

I love the bowtie it comes with. The cushion is very nice inside the shoe. The color is like a black and blue more like blackish navy blue. Would definitely recommend.",
