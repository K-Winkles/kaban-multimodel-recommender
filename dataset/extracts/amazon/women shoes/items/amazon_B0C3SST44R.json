They were comfortable so I thought I'd give it a shot with a slip-on.I can honestly say this and my tennis shoe brand are going to be my go-to brands from now on. After trying probably every shoe they had in the shoe store, and tons of online brands in returns, I finally found something that literally was delivered the day before I leave for a trip to Europe.Usually there is a breaking in with shoes. So I wore these as I ran around my house cleaning and packing and doing everything last minute. From the moment I put them on, there was not a single pinch, rub, pull, or poke. They do slide a bit in the heels, but that's fine because it actually allows a little bit of air to get in and since I may not be wearing socks all the time I kind of like that. Also, sometimes when other shoes slide in the heel, they hurt when they slide back into place. But these do not.For this style, if you don't wear socks, your feet will probably sweat at some point. So thankfully, I do have some no show socks to pair with them.Also with this style, if the top strap moves around a bit, underneath there is a little mesh piece of fabric that is the same or maybe a fair toned flesh color. It's hardly noticeable, but if you are super picky, you should probably know that it's there. I don't know what color it would be with different colored shoes,My toes can wiggle, so it's sort of like a cross between flats and a sneaker.These were meant to be my backup pair that are good for both casual and a little bit of dressing up if the need arises or if my new slides start to hurt, but I can already tell I'm going to be wearing them in airports and probably out and about for a lot of city walking. Plus, I understand they are washable. I tend to think all shoes are washable, it just matters how you wash them, but these are meant to be washed I believe. Finally, they are uber lightweight, so they are perfect for packing, though I may never take them off!A quick, about my feet: When I was 3 I stepped on a thorn that went straight through my foot, so I have some weird sensitivities when I walk a certain way or downstairs. It's similar to a stab from neuropathy I believe. In my twenties I had double bunionectomy surgery, so my feet ache with weather. I'm thin, but gaining some weight with age. I still get carded, so I don't look my age. So, I was worried the style might be too granny, but I think they will go well with my busy mom/entrepreneur lifestyle and though they are comfortable, they don't feel old or orthopedic, if you know what I mean.Sorry no pics, feet pics feel weird to take.Bon Voyage.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this product because I have other shoes from this label.These shoes in Olive look good. They'd be comfortable for someone! But these must be made for feet that need \"a bit more room.\" I usually order an 8.5, and in this case 8.5 is much too large. I added my largest, thickest inserts, and the shoes still flop from my heels like flip flops... they're THAT large.Reasonable price for a shoe I could use, but in this case they're an expensive mistake!I wish I had ordered an 8 to start. That might not have been enough, though. Maybe I really would have done best with 7.5. Hard to know!",
