For years I've been gifting amazon products that weren't quite right because I thought it would be way too much effort to return. But no, this was super easy and efficient and the refund was processed in lightening speed. I was really impressed with the returns process, even though the shoe didn't fit.

                "reviewText": "These are tan. Not grey. They seem comfortable but will need to be returned. I am a 5.5 W in Vans for reference. Based on other reviews, I thought going up to a 6 would work. Sadly, no. And don't think, oh they'll fit with thick socks...NO! These boots aren't made for thick socks. They're short and are cut low. And I can't even get the smaller size since the smallest size offered is 6!If they were to have fit, the next thing I would have been worried about is the zipper in the back. Why in the back, where it's going to be rubbing against the back of your ankle all day?",
