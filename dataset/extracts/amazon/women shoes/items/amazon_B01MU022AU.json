I not only walk to work, I am on my feet all day in a two story high school. I almost never have the chance to sit down. I have worn them with both casual and dress pants. The zipper makes them easy to put on. Well designed. Very happy with this purchase. Well worth the money. Clarks never disappoint.",

Long term I'd recommend your own insert as the padding doesn't hold up.It's got a perfect height heel on it and block so the support is there for your heel (little to no heel fatigue).",

By the end of the day my toes feel like they\u2019ve been crushed by a truck, BUT otherwise they\u2019re far more comfortable than I thought they\u2019d be! I wear a size 11w and finding shoes is a nightmare. I was surprised to find that the slight heel (after years of wearing flats) didn\u2019t bother me at all, I just wish I could find a way to stretch the toes a bit. If I\u2019d inherited my moms feet instead of my dads, they\u2019d be absolutely perfect.",
