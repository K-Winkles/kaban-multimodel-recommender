I compared this model with two other shoes, but honestly found these to be so comfortable that I couldn't pass up! Since I wanted to wear with my semi-heavy socks, I ordered a size 8 at first, half a size larger, but decided to go for a full size larger and purchased 8.5M. Have not stopped wearing them since they came in! No break-in was necessary, and I definitely recommend!",

They weren't quite as wide as I'd have liked but probably would have worn into a good fit over time. If you have very wide feet, these may not fit you.I returned them because of the lack of arch support. I have high arches and after wearing these for less than a minute, I could tell my feet would be screaming after a day of work. No thanks. I'm disappointed because they do look nice, they're just not really made for wide feet or high arches.",
