It\u2019s a classic, versatile slide that pairs well with my business casual and casual attire and allows me to move around with ease and comfort. Coworkers have complimented these shoes!I love the 2 inch wedge, as flat shoes hurt my feet and don\u2019t absorb any shock in the heel. My only gripe is this shoe doesn\u2019t have much support. This pair is tighter in the toebox than the previous pair, but I plan to break them in",
