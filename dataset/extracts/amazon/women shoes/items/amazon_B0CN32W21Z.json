                "reviewText": "I love the look of these shoes. They are great for wearing out and about, but I felt they lacked support during my workout. I usually wear Ghosts, but needed a new pair and decided to try these to save some money. My feet hurt 5 minutes into a treadmill walk. My feet never hurt with my previous shoes. It felt like there was no support at all in the front. Some might like that, but not my feet.",
