At the time it was ; a combination of invention and craftsmanship that's remained at the heart of what we do. From the very beginning we've always thought differently. And done things differently too. From the slipper created by Cyrus and James Clark back in 1825 to the foot-shaped shoe; from our kids' ranges in whole sizes, half sizes and a choice of widths to our state-of-the-art iPad foot gauge; from innovative underfoot cushioning to rapid prototyping and 3D printing, brilliant ideas are what set us apart. Leonardo da Vinci described the human foot as \"a masterpiece of engineering and a work of art\". From the cradle to old age. We've looked at the way it develops. And what we've learned is what helps us make the perfect shoes for you.",

                "reviewText": "These heels are pretty good. I ordered 4 other pairs of heels alongside these to try all of them before a funeral. These weren't necessarily the most fashionable, and they do elongate the look of the foot a little bit more than I'd prefer. But, they were the most comfortable, functional, and they did the trick.A couple things to note:- If you have any semblance of width to your toe joints/bunion area, order a wide. I wouldn't have been able to wear them if I hadn't gotten a wide, and my feet are truly not even that wide, they're long and thin.- There's a bit of extra room even when you order your correct size. These fit justttt well enough to where the heel didn't flap up on me every time I took a step, but I felt like they'd have been perfect if I could just stick something behind my heel to make them a little more snug. I ordered an 11 but a 10.5 probably would've been a little better, I'm still not sure on that part though because it may have been too snug at that point... That size wasn't available anyway so I went with the normal 11 and it was just passable, because once you start walking around in them your foot kind of grips onto them and it works out okay.These worked well for about 4-5 hours, they were slightly uncomfy toward the end but I could have stayed in them longer if needed and I would've survived. That's saying a lot considering the comfort of most heels!I'll now wear them to the office some days.",

My wife's declared them as 'clouds for feet,' which, coming from someone who's always at 30,000 feet, is high praise! If you're in the market for shoes that can keep up with a jet-setting lifestyle or need footwear that screams 'comfort first, style second, but still pretty snazzy,' these shoes are your co-pilot in the journey of foot happiness. Just be ready for your spouse to declare eternal gratitude\u2014these shoes might just be the real MVPs of smooth landings!",
