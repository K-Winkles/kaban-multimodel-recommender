                "reviewText": "I bought these sneakers a few months back specifically for a Fall trip to Europe. I live in the South and had been living in my multiple Keens sandals but needed something for warmer weather and maybe more walking. I say maybe because my sandals are amazing and I could probably use them if it was Summer even though they're not \"technically\" made for walking or hiking. I digress. So, I bought these right before my trip and wore them maybe once or twice for a short amount of time to \"break in\". Short story - I wore them through miles and miles of walking - including the hills of Lisbon! - through hours & hours (and more hours) of plane travel and they felt amazing the whole way. When I took a trip like this last year - before I discovered Keens - I ended up with blisters by day 3. Not anymore! Last but not least - they are SO cute! I love the color, style, heel all of it. Keens are just the best shoes and since I've discovered them I have only bought more styles and varieties. I'm just waiting for a nice work heel and I will buy only Keens forever!",

                "reviewText": "I buy Keen shoes because of their wide toebox. I have a bunion on each foot so finding comfortable shoes can be a chore. I own the Keen Voyageur and the Keen Targhee shoes, but I wanted to find a lighter-weight shoe. These shoes are fantastic! The mesh on the side aligns with my bunions which reduces the pressure on them. They have an insert that supports my arches and keeps my foot stable while walking. They look more like sneakers than hiking shoes and are very nice looking. I own another pair of mesh sneakers, but they do not protect my feet in the woods. I have worn them for several days on flat surfaces and so far so good. I love that they are breathable for the summer. I'm really pleased with these shoes.Update:I just returned from a 10-day vacation in Yellowstone National Park. I wore these shoes every day and am happy to report that I did not get a single blister. Not only did these shoes make walking on the many surfaces throughout my travels safe, my feet never felt sore or achy. These shoes are wonderful!",
