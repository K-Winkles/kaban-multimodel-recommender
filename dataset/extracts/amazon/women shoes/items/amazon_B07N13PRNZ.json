However, I thought they had the \"pre-laced\" type of shoelaces (\"bungee laces\"), where you don't have to manually tie them and adjust them. But these are just standard, regular shoelaces (albeit stretchier than most athletic shoes), so they're not really slip-ons like other variations of their shoes. If that's a concern for you, be aware. Otherwise, they're very nice.",
