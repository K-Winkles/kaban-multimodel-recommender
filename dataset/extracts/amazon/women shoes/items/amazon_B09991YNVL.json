The material is perfect for industry work; I\u2019ve literally had dogs pee on my shoes and I can just hose them off. My feet stay dry.They wore out pretty quickly from my heavy use (50 hrs/week) so I ordered another pair",

They aren't giving me blisters like a lot of new shoes like this do. I like that they don't have any mesh parts which are no good working in a kitchen with mop water and grease etc. They did fit me slightly bigger than usual, so that's why I knocked them down a bit. I just wear nice thick socks and it works. The soles are nice and thick and slip resistant. Two thumbs up!",

                "reviewText": "Fits perfect I wear a size 6.5/7 in women and I ordered the size 7 and so far amazing. Just received so I haven't worn them to work yet. But if you are a stylish person and would hate to have to wear the other type of bulky work shoes- definitely get theses. I have about 1.5-2 inches of extra room. I am also thick so my feet are not slim at all but not wide and these are roomy enough to not hurt my feet. Since they are made like vans I expected them to fit a little snug but they do not.*I am a size 4.5, 5, 5.5 in big kids boys shoes like jordans, vans etcAs far as the cushion; COMFORTABLE! I held off on ordering inserts in which was a good idea because they are actually comfortable! But me being me and wanting to play it safe I'm still going to order the dr scholls to have handy just in case. But so far seems like the cushion will be perfect specially if you're a lighter person.OVERALL: I barely write reviews unless I love a product/the seller deserves it because of the product, and I must say these are a GO! Thank you seller(I will update photos and another update after use)",

                "reviewText": "They do what they are meant to do; good non-slip shoes. The only issue is that they don't seem to last that long. I purchased these in June 2023 and they are already tearing and leaving these weird white scuff marks (even after wiping/caring for). I don't use them extensively where I'm doing a lot other than walking. In comparison to my pervious shoes, these might not even last a whole year.",
