I was a little nervous because some people said it rubbed on the heel, but I haven't had any issues. They slip on so easily. They are very stylish and work with all kinds of pants. I have a wider foot and they are so comfortable they feel like I'm wearing slippers. They have nice arch support and good tread. I have noticed that they are starting to get kind of \"rippled\" on the toe near where the sole meets the fabric but I still love them.",
