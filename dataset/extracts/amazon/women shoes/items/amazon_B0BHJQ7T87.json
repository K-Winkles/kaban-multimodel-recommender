                "reviewText": "This was my first time using the Prime Try Before You Buy option. I decided to try it after having trouble finding a decent pair of sneakers via online shopping. I probably didn\u2019t need to do that with these shoes, since they were New Balance, a quality product. But, looking at the images, I wasn\u2019t sure about the ankle area or if they would feel solid. They do! But, I am still grateful I had the opportunity to try them on before actually purchasing them. It was a lot to spend on another pair of just \u201cmeh\u201d sneakers. I will definitely be using the try before you buy again. And definitely staying a New Balance fan, as they consistently provide cute, supportive sneakers that are worth the investment.",

They\u2019re easy to clean (since they\u2019re white and you kind of have to spot remove here and there). I didn\u2019t like the silver ribbon across the back at first, you can barely notice it in the pictures but I\u2019ve gotten used to how it looks now and it\u2019s not too bad. I don\u2019t wear them to workout in because I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll get really dirty but I do wear them out and about and they\u2019re quite comfortable to walk in. Would buy them again.",

I couldn't even get my foot in the shoe past the laces section because they were so narrow and there is no stretch in the center of the shoe. Also why have laces just for show? You can't tighten these at all.",
