I gave them to my neighbor and they were absolutely adorable on her. I was actually suprosed by how cute they were when they came out of the box. I wish they had fit me. The length was spot on I just can't do shoes that are open on the sides.She said they are easy to walk in the cushion is nice and her knee doesn't hurt at the end of the day..There is a tiny heel to keep your feet off the ground and the color was really pretty. I wish they fit me.",
