So, this shoe fits true to size and even my semi wider feet. I was shocked. The heel is not bothering me at all because the overall walking in tgis shoe is very comfortable. I said 95% perfection because....the inside sole is a tiny bit slippery and makes noise when walking. My dogs freaked out from that noise, running after me, not knowing if they should attack my feet or not, lol. Seriously, lol. Loud, deep, squishy noise, lol. Veru strange. Well, that either goes away after a few hours of wear or I will have to paste something over the inside sole....but for now, I am still debating if I should keep the shoes....because you shouldn't have to paste something over a sole from the get go, right? Well, I'll be thinking about it. However. 4 Stars for a pretty good looking, fitting shoe and oh, yes, the shoe looks elegant and not cheap.",

One of my feet is a size smaller than the other, so buying dress shoes is nothing that's ever fun for me. They are comfortable and I have wide feet too so I put a gel pad in the shoe under the ball of my foot so to not let my foot push too far forward into the toe opening. They looked gorgeous and were all around perfect for a formal ball.The seller was steller and kept excellent communications with me from beginning to end. I'll buy from this seller again.",

They are also light which is great if you are taking them on trips. I would definitely recommend buying these.",
