Love them I have extremely high arches and I do use an insert and this has been my go to gym shoes for 3 years now. I do wear them out but it takes me a year and hitting heavy PRs to do so. Much love for these shoes",

I've been mobile for a couple of years, (for the most part) but still not wearing shoes and walking around a lot. In January, I started losing weight and working towards leaving my house and getting back to living. After making my way through physical therapy, I became stronger and needed shoes so I could start going for walks. I remembered liking my old Reeboks and wanted to get the similar shoe again. This met every mark! They're comfortable, help me feel stable on my feet, and make me want to walk even more. I was tempted to get the recommended size of 8, but the last pair of shoes I ordered were a bit big, so I ordered the 7.5 and they are perfect.",
