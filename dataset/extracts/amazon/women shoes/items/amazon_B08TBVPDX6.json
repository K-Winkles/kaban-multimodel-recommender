                "reviewText": "Likes: The color! It's a great off white. The padding in the back on the achilles is a nice tough. They are breathable and light and I feel great support. Wore them for the first time in Las Vegas walking 10+ miles a day and had no problems.Dislikes: Just a tad bit wide after wearing for a bit. This is more visual than how it actually feels on my foot. For my size, it's just a vanity thing though. I've been trying to make my feet smaller since 5th grade ;)",

They tend to be on the wide side and while being a slip-on, we can't tie the laces up to make them fit better. We tie them up so the laces aren't hanging on the ground. My foot isn't big enough to smooth out those dented spots on the upper wide portion of the shoe.Overall, it's not an attractive (lol) shoe. I understand we get what we pay for. But looking at the pics, they appeared so comfy and a bit stylish compared to real life when we get them in the mail. I had three other colors in my save-for-later cart. They are now deleted. I'm not going to waste more money.I gave it three stars because of not impressed with the appearance of the sneakers when I got them. I stuck them out in my mudd room and didn't even wear them around the house like I normally would to break them in. Others may love these and they work great for them. Just not me...",

                "reviewText": "I ordered my normal size (7) because I read in the reviews that they run big. So I thought I\u2019ll be able to order my correct size & even if they are a bit big, since I wear socks with my tennis shoes, they should still be alright. Well I can\u2019t even get my whole foot in them, even without socks, but I have to wear socks with my tennis shoes since I\u2019m a diabetic. They are way to small, there is no way that I could even get half of my foot in these shoes with socks on too. The color is a bright beautiful blue, but that won\u2019t help me get them on my feet & unfortunately I can\u2019t drive because I\u2019m disabled so I can\u2019t send them back. So, I\u2019m stuck with a pair of shoes that cost $33.16 (with tax) that I can\u2019t afford to throw the money out of the window. If your planning on ordering these shoes, you better order at least 1 size up maybe even 1 1/2 to 2 sizes up because if you\u2019re a diabetic like me, you probably have a hard time finding shoes that fit well, so if you order up in size you might be alright. Oh well, I guess that\u2019s what happens when you try to order shoes online and can\u2019t try them on first. I have a real hard time believing the reviewers of these shoes & I\u2019ll never believe the reviews on shoes again & definitely never order shoes online again! I\u2019m definitely not happy with my purchase & will never buy shoes because I trusted the reviews again. If I could give a review using less than 1 star in each category I would. Such a big disappointment!!!",
