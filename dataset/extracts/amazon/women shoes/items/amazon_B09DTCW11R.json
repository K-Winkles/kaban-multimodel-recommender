They are slightly bigger than what I expected, but with feet that can swell in the summer heat, that is no problem by me! There isn\u2019t much arch support, but there is foam padding inside, so I don\u2019t feel any discomfort even when walking on cement. They are so easy to slip on and off for the long road trips too.",
