                "reviewText": "So I normally wear a 7. After reading reviews I bought 2 pairs, sizes 7.5 and 8. Reviews were spot on, both fit perfectly, no socks for the 7.5 and socks for the 8s. I felt more comfortable with socks so I'll be returning the 7.5sThey are SO comfortable. I was completely steady walking and dancing at my brother's wedding. In fact, embarrassingly, I forgot I was wearing heels at one point, so pivoted alllll the way back on the edge of said heels and promptly fell on my ass. X'DBut the understated MVP of these shoes is the padding that lines the edges of the shoe. I wore them for almost 10 HOURS straight. But there was no biting into my skin, no rash. Nothing.The only con is that there was no room for my inserts, but I kinda expected that.The shoes are as narrow as they look. If you're like me and generally wear sandals, your toes might pinch a little at first. My feet got used to it pretty quick though.I bought them for a wedding but I low key want to get all the colors now hahaha",
