An approach that took us from the back room of a specialty running store to the front of the pack on roads and trails across the world. With innovation at our forefront, our founders created our first shoe with the help of a toaster oven. This was the start of our signature shoe construction to help you move naturally and has kept our brand going for a decade while aiming to keep you running. OUR PURPOSE Unleashing human potential by inspiring the world to move naturally is what Altra Running is all about. Our purpose is built around discovery, joy, responsibility, natural movement, and finding your potential. OUR INNOVATION Our wide-lacing system inspired our signature FootShape design to encourage natural movement. While a household toaster oven inspired our founders, FootShape and Balanced Cushioning has inspired thousands of people to unleash their human potential. That\u2019s the foundation of Altra Running: innovative, disruptive thinking.",

Most wide shoes are too wide or don\u2019t accommodate my toes despite their width. Also, the cushioning is good, which for me means not too little or too much. The shoes offer support and comfort. The rocker design also works well. So far I\u2019m very pleased and thankful that I\u2019ve been able to try many shoes through Amazon.",

I am so glad they listened to their customer base and brought it back! That extra room in the toe box is one of the reasons why many of us fell in love with Altra in the first place! The shoe is fantastic! It's the same level of comfort I had with my Torin 4.5 plush just with a higher stack and curved bottom",
