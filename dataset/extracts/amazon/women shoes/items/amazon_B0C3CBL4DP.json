These shoes look really nice for being just black and white. The sole of the shoes feels really good and durable. The only downside is the material, which is a bit thin. It would not protect you from water. I walk around a lot for my job and these shoes would be better than my other pair. Definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I usually wear 7.5-8 shoe size, so I ordered 8. The fit is great, and I am able to wear thin socks too. These shoes are so incredibly lightweight. Similar to Jeezy's, they're made out of stretchy fabric that's hugging your feet holding a firm grasp while delivering comfortable support. They're very lightweight, I can honestly say these are the lightest tennis shoes I own. They're comfortable and supportive at the same time. I choose gray with purple; company logo doesn't stand out at all on this color scheme, and they look pretty neutral which is my personal preference. I don't like shoes with big logos or flashy colors. These look great and fit the bill. Given the current economic situation, I am sticking to Amazon and off brands. I am so glad this order turned out so good and wasn't a bust. I only have one tip, if your shoe size is in between, go 1/2 size up rather than down. I recommend.",
