I will buy socks to put around insert to help deter the inevitable foot odor that comes with wearing them with bare feet. They work with trouser socks too! Sizing seems correct. I only have to be more careful with the toe as not to scuff them.",

                "reviewText": "I wear many different styles of this brand shoe so I was surprised by the fit of the Cora Charm loafer size 7wide. I thought the leather would be soft and pliable but it was stiff and no flex whatsoever. The wide width was too wide and the heel would not stay in place so it would rub a blister in no time on me. I read the reviews and no one complained of it not being true to size. I must have a dozen pairs of Clarks shoes in my closet and thought it was a safe bet. I could not even wear this style in a 7 because the leather is too stiff.",
