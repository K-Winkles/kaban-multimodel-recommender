However, I hate that they push up against the top of my feet. Thankfully I didn't have to walk in them for too long but I see this as an issue if I had to wear them to work or a longer occasion. I've kept them but I'll be wearing them with very smooth stocking next time. Maybe I'll break them in by that time.",
