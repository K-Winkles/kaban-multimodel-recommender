                "reviewText": "After wearing out my Asics gel soles, I bought their new model. They were horrible and badly bruised my upper foot. Was trying to figure out what to buy because I need extra cushion since I have a neuroma and sesamoiditis. Just happened to see an advertisement for Sketchers PB shoes. Ordered normal size and half size up. My regular size fit perfectly. They were comfortable right out of the box! I don't need my orthotics in them because the arch support is really good. Toe box is wide and comfortable without feeling like my foot is unstable. Very stable on the court but not motion hindering at all. I hope they last longer than my Asics and continue to be this comfortable! If they do, they will be the only PB shoe I'll buy from now on. Love them so far! (I play PB 4-6 times/week)",
