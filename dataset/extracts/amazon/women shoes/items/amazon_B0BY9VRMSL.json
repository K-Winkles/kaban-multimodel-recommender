                "reviewText": "As soon as I put these new shoes on I was skeptical, and dismayed. They felt too tight and I really didn\u2019t want the hassle of having to return them. Then I realized I had been wearing nothing but flip flops for several days and my feet weren\u2019t used to any kind of confinement so I decided to give it a day or two. I made sure the laces were loosened and I wore them to dinner. The next day I put them on I realized they felt pretty good so I decided to wear them playing Pickleball. They were absolutely wonderful! I have never worn court or Pickleball shoes while playing (I\u2019m a fairly new player) and I liked how they gripped the court and were very responsive when I moved. Previously I wore a very worn out (no tread whatsoever) pair of trainers. Wasn\u2019t expecting the shoes to make that much of a difference in my game but it was the missing link. They don\u2019t have a wide toe box like a running shoe, they\u2019re meant to fit more snugly. These fit me perfectly and as soon as they wear out I\u2019ll buy another. I know it\u2019s unlikely that I\u2019ll become a pickleball champion but I have a lot more confidence in myself and my game after wearing these.",

However, the very FIRST time I wore them, I was playing on a hard, indoor Pickleball court and as I was moving backward and sideward to hit a volley, the shoes stuck to the floor causing me to fall hard. Thank God I did not suffer any broken bones! Is there a way to prep (scuff) court shoes to avoid sticking?",
