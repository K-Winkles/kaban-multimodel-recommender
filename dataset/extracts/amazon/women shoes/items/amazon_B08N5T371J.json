                "reviewText": "The shoes has a nice look. I purchased the shoes but accidentalloy purchased 2 pairs (not sure how I missed that). The shoes also feel comfortable at the first try-on but within an hour, I had severe foot pain and that pain actually lasted for about 1 week. I could have been that the shoes did not work for me specifically or it could have been the workmanship of the shoes - I'm not sure.My lifestyle is very busy and I don't always try products immediately when I get them. At this point, I am past the deadline to returnt he shoes and am stuck with two pair of them (1 pair never worn; and 1 pair worn 1 time). I will have to find someone to whom I can give them. If you are considering purchasing these or any shoes, I would recommend this in hindsight: 1) Try them on immediately. 2) To prevent damaging the bottom, wear them for a while in the home on carpet (if you have it). If you wear them out and find out that they don't work, you won't be able to return them (I don't think; I didn't check). Trying them on for a few seconds, they will feel lovely. Leave them on longer in the house to make sure they work for you. Again, at first, the comfort is beautiful. It wasn't until I left to go to church that they started hurting. I should say that I have a difficult time finding shoes that comfort my feet specifically. So, this could totally be my personally situation and the experience may not be the same for others. So, try them if you like the look; just wear them in the house for longer than a minute to make sure they work before you wear them. And - do it before the return window closes. :)",

I wanted them so badly for my granddaughter's Sweet 16. I'll have to try another style.",
