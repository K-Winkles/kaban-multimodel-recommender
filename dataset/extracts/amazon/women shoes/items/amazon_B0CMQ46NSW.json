                "reviewText": "I have 2 other pairs of Dream Pairs shoes and I do like them, but these are actually even more comfortable and stay on my heel better than the others I have. It\u2019s a big upgrade. I love that their shoes are machine washable and flexible enough to store, carry in your bag or pack in a suitcase.The arch support is just an insert and I worried it would be bulky causing my foot to not fit as well or to slip out of the shoe when I walked. When I put the shoes on they fit well and the insert stays firmly in place. I do have rather high arches so this is good to keep my feet from getting tired so quickly, a complaint for many other flat shoes I have ordered.My foot is 10\u201d when measured flat against the floor and I ordered a size 9. The sizing is correct for wearing these without socks. The back of the shoe does not flip as I walk which was a great surprise but also isn\u2019t so snug as to cause marks on my heels.",

                "reviewText": "As many of us do, I love shoes. Here is my checklist for what makes a successful shoe, with information about how these particular shoes did:1. Must be cute. Check. This is a vital consideration; if the shoe doesn't get past this hurdle, then it's a no go.2. Don't look cheap. Most of the check. Not the most expensive looking shoes, but they don't look extremely cheap, either.3. Easy to put on. Check. These were super easy to slip on.4. Immediately comfortable. Check. My size fit me perfectly, and the material is soft. Nothing presses on my heel or anywhere else on my feet, meaning no sores or blisters down the (literal and metaphorical) road.5. Long-term comfortable. Check. My feet didn't hurt after several hours of wearing them.6. Versatile. Check. I can wear these with jeans, pants, skirts, and dresses.7. If dressier shoes, can they be worn on bare feet? (No socks or hose for me, thank you.) Check. The only thing I didn't like about these shoes is that the insole comes out when I take my feet out; however, the insoles are easy to put back in.Basically, I don't want shoes that are cute but uncomfortable, or shoes that are ugly but comfortable. These shoes check all of my boxes, and I really like them.",

                "reviewText": "I have several similar pairs of shoes, but with a pointed toe. I was surprised at how much more room in the toe box you have with a square toe option and it looks good - more fashionable than a rounded toe (more intentional). I have a normal to wide foot and these fit well, so if you have narrow feet they might be a bit too roomy. In terms of length they are true-to-size. In my case US Women's 8 1/2. The insole was more padded than other similar styles that cost more and there was an effort to build up a supportive padded arch as part of this, so overall I'm very happy with these shoes. I don't know if the rubber sole is the type that will wear well or if it will basically just run down quickly at the toe, a lot of that depends on the firmness of the rubber and only time will tell. Still, for the price it's a good shoe, even if it only lasts one season - very comfortable and stylish.",
