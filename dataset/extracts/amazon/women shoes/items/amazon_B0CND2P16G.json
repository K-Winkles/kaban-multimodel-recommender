I was absolutely shocked by the comfort of these heels which have the most comfortable padding and slip-proof soles I've ever found in a heeled shoe before. These are my favorite work shoes I've ever purchased and for the price I couldn't be more thrilled, I plan to order them in more colors because I can't get enough of them!Pros:1) most comfortable heels I've ever worn. Walking a few hours in these felt the same as wearing my favorite sneakers, the cushioning is fantastic and soles are excellent for a working woman. If you work long days on your feet, you have nothing to fear with these.2) gorgeous, incredible quality for the price. They look so sleek, professional and lovely.3) suitable for wide feet and those unsteady in high heels. I can't handle pointy ended shoes or thin heels but these are my Cinderella glass slipper, a perfect fit (I ordered 8.5 and I am 8.5 wide usually) and perfect function/mobility with the short and sturdy heelNot a single con, get them!!",

                "reviewText": "When I ordered these shoes I was hopeful that I would like the look. For me personally they are not my favorite look and prefer a more rounded toe. However, I am reviewing this from the standpoint of the shoe and quality. I ordered the black shoe in 6.5. I typically wear a size 7 in a tennis shoes and anywhere from a 6 or 6.5 in a heel/dress shoe. I think a 6 would fit me a bit better. I do have a wider foot and these shoes are comfortable and fit nicely in the width of my foot. If you have a wide foot and looking for a comfortable shoe that is supportive this may be a good shoe to try. It is difficult to find rounded toes shoes or pointed toed shoes for wider feet. The block heel feels a little on the chunky side, but if you are on your feet for a longer time and need a dress shoe and you prefer something elevated rather than a flat, this shoe will do. The outside is a nice leather material feel and the inside as some cushioning that reminds me of some of my Dr. Scholl's shoes I own.",
