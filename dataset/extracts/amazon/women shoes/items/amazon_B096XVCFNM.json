Great for walking a 9 day tour in Italy\u2014all types of surfaces. I even washed them when I got home and they held up perfectly. FYI: they run small so order a size up (especially for travel if your feet swell).",

Problem is the fit. I wear a size 6-61/2 depending on shoe. I went with the six and they were like two sizes to big in length and way to wide. I tried to put inserts in but then the back was to low. Sorry to have to return them and they do not come in \u00bd sizes so I will be looking for another shoe.",

When I protested I was asked to measure my feet and they would send me a pair that fit. I was told I could keep the too small pair. I only am wanting a refund which is now not being offered. I don\u2019t want another pair of these shoesDO NOT buy from this merchant!",
