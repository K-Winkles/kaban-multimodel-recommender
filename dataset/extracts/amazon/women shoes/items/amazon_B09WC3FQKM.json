I have RA and have started to walk regularly but noticed my feet have started to bother me so I ordered a new pair of Asics in hopes of some relief. These did not disappoint!! As soon as I put them on and walked around there was no discomfort at all. I still need to go on some long walks to see how they hold up, but I don't expect any issues. Great price for great shoes.",
