                "reviewText": "These shoes look very nice, and I was so disappointed that they didn\u2019t work out. They were a little on the narrow side, but wearable. The Zippers would barely move. I was afraid I was going to break them. It felt like they were glued shut. I was not confident that the zippers will last. If the zippers were better quality, I would be willing to wear the shoes and break them in. You can\u2019t take these shoes on or off, without using the zipper. I don\u2019t want to fight with them every time.",
