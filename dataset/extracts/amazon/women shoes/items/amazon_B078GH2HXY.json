                "reviewText": "Finally found a comfortable pair of shoes. Should have trusted Clark\u2019s from the word go, but tried others which were either too wide and gapped at my instep or my heel slipped out or they hurt my toes.After returning so many shoes, thank you Amazon for this benefit, my feet slipped into these and they are perfect as an everyday shoe or a dress shoe.Had waited until these were on sale and ordered my usual size. A great buy at 54% off for leather shoes. As soon as I slipped them on they felt good, so put in my heel lift, put on some thin socks and went out to dinner in them. They were comfortable all evening. I have a narrow heel and they didn\u2019t slip off when I walked plus there was plenty of room for my big toes and bunions. The leather is soft and supple.The style is plain and they look smart, but they are flats. I wish they came in other colors in my size and would like a pump like this with a block heel. Hope Clark\u2019s has them. They will be my go to brand for shoes from now on.",

                "reviewText": "The shoes looked lovely and I thought I had the perfect pair when I first put them on. But I morphed from Cinderella to an ugly stepsister when I tried to take a step. The instep was too narrow and cut into the top of my foot. After 2 steps it got to be too painful to continue. So I guess I'll continue to search for my prince/shoe.The shoes were returned. The return process was easy and the original shipping went off without a hitch. I wanted to give it 5 stars because it was such a pretty shoe and well made. But it failed to fit my foot despite buying my usual Clark's size.",
