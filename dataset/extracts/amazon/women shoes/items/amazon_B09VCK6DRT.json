                "reviewText": "This is my second pair. I bought my first pair a year and a half ago at Nordstrom Rack and they are so comfortable. I wear them to work and I stand/walk 8 hours on concrete. I switch these out with another pair of Adidas to change up my look and they held up for a year and a half. I got these because my last pair were looking a little gnarly. Still wear the old pair for long walks. Aside from work I generally walk between 3 \u2014 6 miles almost daily just to give you an idea how much wear these get.Also, I should note I have Morton\u2019s Neuroma which is a sharp pain with nerve damage between the 3rd and 4th toe from wearing narrow toed high heels for most of my adult life. If I don\u2019t have the right shoe I cannot run, walk, or stand for long periods of time without pain.Besides being comfortable they\u2019re a good looking shoe. I get complimented on them a lot.I\u2019m between an 8 to 8.5 in shoe size, but because I have a wider foot and walk long distances for exercise, and get around 14,000 steps just at work my feet tend to swell so I purchased size 9 in store after trying size 8.5.They are a little big in the toe box, but not sloppy big. I needed the extra wiggle room due to swelling from being on my feet all day. The 8.5 would\u2019ve been fine for casual wear. Also, they are designed to be worn with or without socks. I wear these without 100% of the time. I just spray my feet with dove deodorant and slip these puppies on and I\u2019m good to go.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a slip-on shoe to replace my Skechers GoWalk shoes. I like to go for quick walks through my neighborhood and like the slip-on vs. laced running shoes.These were affordable and thought it would be a step up in brand name. Sorry Skechers! I own a pair of women's 9 Adidas Court shoes that could've sized down with. Based on that and the other reviews for the Puremotion Adapt on sizing down, I ordered a women's 8.5. Holy tight and narrow! I would consider my feet to be normal width. The 8.5's were extremely hard to get on and the shoe felt narrow. Thankfully with free returns, I swapped them out for a size 9. Still a struggle to get on but more room in the toe box & still a bit narrow. I'm hoping with wear, this all will improve. Out of the box, no rubbing or blisters. This is a huge plus compared to all of the Skechers GoWalk shoes I've purchased in the past (definite blisters from the breaking-in period).As for support and cushion - I disagree with other reviewers. Yes, there is some memory foam in the sole. But not a lot and very little arch or heel support. I can't imagine using these shoes for running. I like the looks of them. I wear them without socks. If you wish to wear socks, I would size up!Affordable, stylish but tight and could use more arch support and cushioning!",

I was completely surprised how lightweight, supportive & comfortable they are! As a busy mom, I'm on my feet nearly all day, running errands, standing doing chores & running up and down 2 flights of stairs. These quickly became my daily-wear shoe because they are soft, easy on & off and perfect! I swapped out the insole for an orthopedic one, because of my back. And they're definitely my favorites. I want more in different colors! Even my teenager borrows them from me lol",
