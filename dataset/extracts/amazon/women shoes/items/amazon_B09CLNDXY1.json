                "reviewText": "These shoes just arrived yesterday and I tried them on, while comparing them to some other shoes that I just bought. I like a lot about these shoes, but there are a issues that make me lean towards returning them. These shoes have great cushioning from heel to toe and they have an ample toe box, but there is too much padding around the heels that make them uncomfortable. The padding seems to have some give to it, which makes my heels slip up and down when I walk; particularly on the right foot, which is shorter. There is also too much pressure on the medial sides of the heels from the supportive side rails. My guess is that my heels are just too wide for the shoe. I wanted a cushioned shoe due to my right foot's tendency to supinate and I wanted extra support with that respect, but the heels of these shoes are a bit too annoying. I would go with a wider shoe to help with the heel problem, but the toe box is already a bit wide. While the sizing for the length of the shoe is pretty accurate, the width of this shoe is just strange. It is pretty roomy in the toe box, but fairly narrow in the heel. I know that some people have feet shaped like that. I always felt that my feet were like that until I put on these. That feature seems to be a bit exaggerated with this shoe, but it may work for someone else. I think it would be a great shoe for a person who supinates and has a narrower heel. However, if you size up for more room at the toes or if you have one foot that is slightly smaller than the other, you may still run into some issues with the heel of the shoe slipping up and down. Overall, these shoes are pretty nice and seem to be well made. They could be golden for the right feet.",

                "reviewText": "I was pretty addicted to Brooks but they seem to have dropped in quality. So I saw these came in a wide and were SUPER cute, but as far as being a wide. I think someone just stuck a wide sticker on the box since it does not say wide on the tongue of the shoe, so I may have just bought from a shady place. I thought I could live with them so I wore them out and about for one day and my feet went numb because they were so tight, but since I wore them I think I am stuck with them.... Looks like another pair of shoes in the \"I REALLY HOPED I COULD LIVE WITH THEM\" pile. If you don't need a wide ORDER ONE ANYWAY! I can't imagine how narrow the regular are.",

But exceptionally this pair looks different and much nicer but also so comfortable. It gives my feet the support I need. Also the new style seems to be more durable. Normally the every time I buy a \u201ctraditional \u201c style, the sides and near the toes tear off easily. but doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with this style and format. I am going to buy the same pair in different color maybe as my next pair!",
