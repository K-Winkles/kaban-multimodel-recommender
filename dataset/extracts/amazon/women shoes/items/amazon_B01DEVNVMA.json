                "reviewText": "I have these shoes in 4 different colors, and this is my second (back up pair) in the taupe. I teach in these and walk ALL DAY and never come home with my feet hurting. They are super cute with jeans and even dresses or skirts. The sole is memory foam, and the heel is some sort of soft substance (not wood as it appears). I have absolutely nothing negative to say about them. They do run a tiny bit small. I have pairs that are 8 (my true size) and 8.5, and if you are going to wear socks or no-sees, I would suggest going a 1/2 size up.",

They fit perfectly!! And so comfortable, the cushion inside was a huge plus. They looked cute with every outfit I tried on. Cargo pants, leggings, and jeans. I danced 3 hours in these booties, spinning around in west coast swing, stomping. The shoes stayed solid, didn\u2019t scuff the floor, non-slippery, but also not sticky. Perfect shoes for dancing. Highly recommend.",
