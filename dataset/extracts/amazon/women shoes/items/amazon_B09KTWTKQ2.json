        "description": "The GEL-SONOMA 6 running shoe is designed for the great outdoors. Taking inspiration from the ASICS trail running family, this shoe is a versatile offering that's functional for trail runs, light hiking, and other outdoor adventures. We also used fewer resources to color the sockliner for a more sustainable design approach. The focus this season was to improve the fit of the upper, so we implemented a new last design that provides a more secure midfoot and heel fit, while the wider toe box allows the toes to spread out. The synthetic stitching on the overlays is designed to improve durability while also helping feet stay secure and reduce slipping. Underfoot comfort stems from a full-length AMPLIFOAM midsole and GEL technology cushioning unit that's placed where runners need the most impact absorption. To increase the softness with every step, we've included an ORTHOLITE sockliner for excellent comfort. Additionally, the multi-directional grip outsole improves traction on a variety of surfaces. All of these comfort components are complemented by durable properties, such as the solid rubber outsole-making this shoe a versatile choice for the trails.",

                "reviewText": "First off, the listing is wrong. Both the regular Gel-Sonoma 6 AND the Gel-Sonoma 6 G-TX shoes are listed in the same listing, which says that they all have the waterproofing. This is not the case. The ones that have waterproofing also have a small tag on the side that says \"Goretex\". I was very disappointed as that was one of the features I was looking for, and feel I was gypped a bit on these. Unfortunately, I realized this AFTER I had already removed the tags and worn them outside.On the bright side, these are the most comfortable shoes I have worn in a long time. I have overpronation and end up with my weight on my ankles as my feet roll (and yes, it is as uncomfortable as that sounds). These shoes REALLY support my feet. I noticed the difference today walking around, as my big toe usually does all the work. Today, the muscles on my other toes actually got some work and they are sore (but in a good way, I can tell it is just muscles being used that haven't been used in a while).I may just have to buy myself another pair that IS waterproof later on.I wish the manufacturer would make a pair of walking shoes just like these, I don't really need them for running but just for normal use.",

                "reviewText": "The main problem with these shoes was the size. I was recommended to buy the Gel Sonoma 5 shoes in half a size larger than usual, so I did, and those shoes fit perfectly and I loved them. For the Gel Sonoma 6, I got the same size but they were a little too large (but I wore them for a whole day and didn't feel I could return them). Also, they just don't feel that they give me the rebound and forward momentum that the Gel Sonoma 5 did. Apart from those problems, they are lightweight and were reasonably priced. Just get your regular size--don't go up half a size as I did.",
