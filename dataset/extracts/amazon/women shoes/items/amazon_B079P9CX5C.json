I ordered a nine.... normal width....she slid her foot in and loved that they were so soft.. it is a suade footbed,....she loved that there was \"no bump\"...(arch)....they slipped in the heel a bit when she walked, so next day I ran to the drugstore and bought the heel pads that stick in so you don't slip or get blisters.....This made them an absolute perfect fit and comfort. Probably the only spot that was uncomfortable was the top of the toe box.....super tight....but she wore those little \"no see\" black nylon socks and it was perfect for her band concert performance. Super happy with this purchase as this is also a quality, well made shoe.",
