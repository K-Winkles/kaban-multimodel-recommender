My research led me to read numerous Amazon advertisements & reviews before deciding to order Rykas because they design shoes specifically for women\u2019s feet! The first pair looked great but felt too big on my feet. However, the next pair was a completely different style which Amazon had sent a, \u201cYou might like this\u201d message that exactly matched my search! They were discounted as a slighted used return but they looked comfortable & gorgeous! They fit perfectly & felt COMFORTABLE! The next day I wore them on our four mile hike and they felt great!The Ryka Impress was MY perfect match. The sizing was correct according to their measurement with enough room to add silicone arch pads under the insole if needed, have generous toe room to accommodate my \u201cDuck Feet\u201d, great stability & structure, no sliding forward or heal rubbing, soles have excellent grip on pavement, gravel or rock & the memory foam insoles are heavenly\ud83d\ude4fThank you Ryka & thank you Amazon",

Perfect fit, great sole support, just the right amount of arch support. I wasn't too thrilled about the color but I bought them to wear to the gym, so I don't need to care about looks as much as function. These shoes are mostly white but also a slight pastel blue and pink which is cute. All of my pairs have held up well. Well worth the money.",

I got the 6 1/2 wide & they fit me perfectly. I wore them at home the day they were shipped to me & wore them on a 30 minute brisk walk this morning. They are true to size for me. AMAZED, no rubbing or blisters! I ordered the brilliant white and they\u2019re very pretty. Love finding a pair of shoes that don\u2019t make your feet look humongous, are a neon color, etc. I had also ordered another style of Rykas in 2 different sizes. However, they did not fit me well. I did the try before you buy, and find that\u2019s the way to go because shoes are so inconsistently sized anymore. This way, you don\u2019t have all those charges going in and out, confusing and annoying ha ha!",
