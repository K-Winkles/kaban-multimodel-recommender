However, there is A LOT of room on top of my foot. That made them dangerous for stepping on rocks, etc., like my foot wanted to roll out. Even with thick socks. I was able to fix it by taking out the original insert, and putting a couple of totally flat inserts in then adding the STQ molded insert. They have been helping my PF a lot.",

Besides my feet feeling good, my knees don't hurt from them either.I read through the reviews and the glowing ones convinced me to give these a try.I bought the purple/black and really like the two tone, I am self conscious of wearing a 9 1/2 but these shoes don't appear to look big. I ordered another pair in a light color for thoughts of summer.I hope these last as long as they have for some of the reviewers, but even if they don't, around $30 is worth good-feeling feet to me.",

                "reviewText": "I usually wear size 9 and these fit well. I do have room to wear with socks comfortably. They claim to slip on easily but they really don't, unless you have very slender feet. If you have any mobility or flexibility concerns you WILL need a shoe horn. I really like the stretchy/compressing sock like opening of this shoe. Again, it's snug which can make it timely to put on. However, the opening may loosen up as I continue to wear them.I tend to have issues with planters fasciitis, so far these shoes have provided the comfort I've been searching for. The soles are really durable and hard. I can't feel chunky gravel whatsoever when I'm walking in these. I'm not joking when I say you could step on a small nail and not feel it. These soles are thick. They also have a nice and natural rocking to them while walking. As if they help propel you forward. Don't worry. It's not enough to make you trip up or fall. It's more like a light momentum keeper. Perfectly lightweight shoes. Lighter than most athletic shoes I've tried before. Well worth the purchase. I will recommend to others for sure. I gave 4 stars due to the effort needed to slip my foot into a supposedly \"easy to slip on\" shoe.",

                "reviewText": "These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I've ever put on my feet! I'm standing at a cash register for hours at a time and needed something that would be very kind to my feet. These shoes are so very comfortable! I love the ball or bladder thing in the heel! It acts like a shock absorber and actually lifts my foot for the next step! The firm memory foam that the insole is made of, keeps my foot in place inside the shoe. Most memory foam insoles are made of soft memory foam and after a short time breaks down and absorbs odor. These shoes do not. Also the top of the shoe is made of some type of material, I don't know what you call it, but it's like a sock but not a sock. It's soft but holds it's shape. I love it! The only thing I would have liked to see is a finger tab at the back of the heel making it easier to pull on but other than that, I have nothing bad to say about these shoes. They are most comfortable, beautiful looking and added an extra 1 1/2 inches to my height! Note: order a half size larger than you normally wear. they run a bit small. I highly recommend these shoes to anyone, especially to those standing or walking for long periods of time.",
