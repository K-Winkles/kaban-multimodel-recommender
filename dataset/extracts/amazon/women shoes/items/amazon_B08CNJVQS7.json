Best shoes for running at an incredibly reasonable price.Update: unfortunately after one week I had to return them because they made my right foot hurt, but I think it was a defect of this particular pair only, because I have never had any issues with Saucony. In fact, I just replaced them with a different model (Echelon 9), so we\u2019ll see. I\u2019m looking forward to running with them.",
