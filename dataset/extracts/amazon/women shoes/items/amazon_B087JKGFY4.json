                "reviewText": "These heels are the absolute best I've ever owned. I bought them for a cruise knowing I wanted some casual nude heels, so I turned to Naturalizer because they have never let me down. One thing to understand with Naturalizer is a lot of their products are sandal-like, which is my preference because I like a lot of points of contact keeping my feet in the shoe, but I have a tall in-step (top of foot), making it difficult for me to wear almost all shoes - especially strappy heels. These have a bungee attachment on the side to stretch out the straps, and the faux leather is soft and cushioned. I can slip them on without unbuckeling the strap, and they make my legs look fantastic. I've worn them atleast 5 times since buying in early December and I always get compliments, and I'm the last girl to remove her heels at the end of the night (lol). The ONE downside is the faux leather can get ruptured pretty easily. :( Luckily the heels are nude and you can't tell, so not sure how it would fare with other colors. Despite that, I love these, and I still want every color!!",

                "reviewText": "I usually wear block or wedge heels only but I wanted a sleek look for an upcoming event. I was nervous about the height because the heel is more narrow than what I\u2019m used to but because of the platform base, they are easy to walk in. These shoes are very comfortable, my left pinky toe does feel a little weird, so I might place a Band-Aid on it when I wear them for my event. There\u2019s a hint of rubbing on that one toe when I walk so that is the reason for deducting one star from my review. The color is darker than I thought but true to nude as the description. I thought they would be more beige than nude but that was my faulty thinking. I have pudgy ankles and the strap still fit. I just didn\u2019t buckle all the way in the pic because I have long nails and my honey wasn\u2019t home to help me. I feel they are true to size. Amazon recommended I buy an 8W but I ignored that and purchased 8 regular width as I don\u2019t normally wear a wide width. If you have a wide foot you should buy the wide width because there isn\u2019t any play, these are a snug fit for me. They are attractive and comfortable so overall I\u2019m pleased.",
