                "reviewText": "Took these out yesterday for a quick 9. The spikes aren't metal which I'm SO grateful for. I do wish the shoes had come with a spike removal tool but it's totally fine because they aren't metal. My home course doesn't allow metal. They fit nice and snug and better than I expected them to. I ordered a size 7. Most 6.5W or 7's fit me. I have a 6.5 foot but need a slightly wider toe box. I have no issues with these being too tight and the 7 wasn't too long, made for a great overall fit. There is a lot of snug cushion, made my feet feel very pampered and secure. Plus they are super cute. I was a little worried reading through some of these reviews before I checked out but I'm VERY happy. And for the price? I can definitely afford to replace these as they wear out, or buy them in different colors! I can't wait to try them out in the rain next!",

They are the most comfortable golf shoe I\u2019ve ever had! The Tech Response looked similar but they are not. The toe area is more narrow, and I have a narrow foot (my pair was reg width). It\u2019s snug but not uncomfortable. I walked 18 and they are adequate but not nearly as comfortable as the bounce 2\u2019s and not worth the money. They will be more water resistant than mesh shoes since they are all leather. They are quality construction but average comfort. Adidas please bring back the Response Bounce 2\u2019s!",
