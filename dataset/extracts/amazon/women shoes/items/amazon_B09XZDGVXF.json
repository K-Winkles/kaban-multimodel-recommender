However, I delayed replacing the last pair I purchased last year because they were still in great shape except for some wear on the toe. I wore those shoes everyday for work in a job that requires a great deal of walking and standing all day. I started getting hip pain and wondered if my shoes were causing it. Yes! The minute I put on the new pair I noticed the difference in the padding and comfort. After using them for a week at my job, even after walking and standing for hours, I am pain free. Such a relief. I will always buy Saucony running shoes for sports or everyday use.",

                "reviewText": "I am pleased with this shoe. I have always walked on the outside of my feet, but up until now, I had never bothered to look for a shoe to correct it. Recently, I started walking again, and I decided it was time to look for a more comfortable shoe. This is it! I feel much more stable on my feet, and my hips and shins are not sore after walking. Who knows? Maybe I will try running some.",
