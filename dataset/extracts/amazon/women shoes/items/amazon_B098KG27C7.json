I'm narrow in the heel but wider across the toe-box and Merrells don't pinch across that part of my foot. These are no exception. I wore them to hike a very rocky trail in the Picos de Europa (northern Spain) and locally in the Pacific NW woods. They provide great traction without being too stiff or heavy. Waterproof too. Highly recommended.",
