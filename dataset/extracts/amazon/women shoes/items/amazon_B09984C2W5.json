                "reviewText": "I originally bought the 9 without looking at the reviews & it was too big even with socks. One caveat is, putting insoles fit perfectly. I decided to exchange it for an 8.5 & it fits perfectly with socks, tho insoles are a bit tight at first. After some weeks I think the upper part became a bit more loose to allow for the insoles, or maybe I just got used to the tightness. I don't think the leather upper is the best quality since the price is quite low for strong leather, but thin leather suits my daily work walking well. I ordered black bc stains are less likely to show & it just looks sleeker ie professional. Would recommend, tho for bigger sizes probably need to size down.",

                "reviewText": "I'm typically a pretty solid size 8. On the rare occasion an 8.5. I have fat feet, so W is also usually a more comfortable fit. I bought the 8W despite seeing someone say they were a bit large. That was a mistake. I actually think I could have gone for the 7.5 W (or maybe even a 7.5 regular??) potentially because there's a lot of room in the toe area. I hate returning things, so I thought I'd just deal with it, but that was silly, they're definitely too large. Since I wore them already I'm going to try some arch support insoles and see if that eats up the extra space.They are comfortable though and the non slip definitely works far better than my last pair of non slips.",

I have worn Birkenstocks exclusively for the past 5 years for work and decided to order these while I waited for my favorite Birks to go back in stock. The first day was fine but the second day I REALLY felt the pain. The toe box is so narrow, zero arch support and I had to buy a massager to rub my feet and be able to walk again after day 4. Needless to say I ordered Birks immediately, threw these out, and had to wear regular birks to work the next day praying I didn\u2019t slip until my go-tos came in.",
