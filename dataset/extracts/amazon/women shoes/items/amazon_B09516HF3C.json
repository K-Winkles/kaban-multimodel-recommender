They have enough padding, they're well fitting, they last a long time and they hold up. That means alot to me. I am very hard on shoes. These seem to last longer than other brands like asics. For the peace they look cute, are comfy and last. If you spend any amount of time on your feet walking around, get some Saucony shoes.",

These were hands-down the most comfortable sneakers I've had in a while! I'm normally between a size 9.5 and 10, depending on the shoe, but I decided to try an 11 (I don't think they had 10.5). Maybe it's the extra room, but these are great! Also more comfortable than the New Balance of the same size. I walk about 15-20 miles a week, and the tread is holding up well.
