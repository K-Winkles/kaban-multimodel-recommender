I usually buy Easy Spirit, but I clicked on a link while searching a list of \"most comfortable wide walking shoes.\" Ryka shoes were reasonably priced, and pretty, so I decided to take a chance. The first time I put them on, I could immediately feel the plushness of the shoe and the arch support. I don't have super-wide feet, but I am most comfortable with a wide shoe. These have plenty of room. They are prettier than I expected. Mine are electric blue and black. I've walked in them, and there has been no pinching, sliding, or other discomforts. Based on my experience so far, I would recommend these shoes to women looking for something pretty, but easy on the feet.",

They are a good half inch shorter, and quite pinchy!I am hoping they will stretch, my last pair is worn out and the soles are still soft and supportive, so I am going to give them a try, but if they have downsized their product the next pair is going back, I am a loyal customer, but shoes are too expensive to have sore feet!TLDR: at least the black mesh with lavender are NOT true to size!",
