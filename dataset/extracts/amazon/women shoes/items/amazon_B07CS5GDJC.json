The heel was a tad stiff but I just stepped on them to soften them up and wore them the first day and all day. I've got a couple of other boots and these beat them by a mile. They're black suede and just gorgeous. I've received compliments on them. So glad I took a chance on them! They're stylish and so comfortable.",
