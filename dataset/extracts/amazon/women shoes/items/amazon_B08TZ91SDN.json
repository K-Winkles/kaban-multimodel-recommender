The cliff-lined beaches, the mountain trails, the breezy boardwalks. The year-round sunshine that inspires endless adventures and a unique, life\u2019s-for-living attitude. And, of course, the casual-chic style that defines the Southern Californian look. It's why we created Rocket Dog. We wanted to make women's shoes that radiated the SoCal spirit. Which meant fusing dawn-till-dusk comfort with fun, vibrant, and edgy design. Like the typical Californian girl, we take global trends and make them our own. This gives every style a refreshing individuality, whilst staying directly on the pulse. While trends change with every season, our dedication to injecting the SoCal Spirit into every style remains the same.",

                "media_text": "How to find the right shoe size for you Why is this important? Every shoe manufacturer uses different lasts in terms of instep height, toe shape and foot width. However, the basis for finding your own shoe size is always the length of your feet. Thus, you should always determine your foot length before buying in order to choose the right shoe. Step 1: tracing your feet Take off your socks, place a piece of paper against a wall, and place your foot on it so that your heel touches the wall. Now use a pen to trace the shape of the foot on the front of the toes. Hold the pen exactly upright. Important: Both feet must be measured, as they are often of different lengths! Feet often swell during the day, which is why we recommend taking the measurement in the late afternoon. Step 2: measure and add Now you can measure the edge of the paper from where the heel was to the longest toe and determine the length of your foot. Use your longer foot as a guidance. You get the required inner length of the shoe by adding an extra of 0.4 inch to your foot length. Step 3: Look it up in the shoe size table Our shoe size table helps you convert your own foot measurements into manufacturer sizes in order to make the right choice.",

These are great if you need to be on your feet all day. The padding is very comfortable, and I had limited pain which is quite rare when I'm stage managing. It also holds up very well and keeps its cushion even after extended use. Definitely worth the price. I would recommend to anyone in an industry where you need black shoes or you're just looking for comfy sneakers.",

I purchased the 'Lilac' & it is exactly as pictured! Very pretty pastel color with the shoe running a little bit more narrow. I purchased my regular size of 7-1/2M & the length is perfect. Width is just a tiny bit narrow so if you have wide feet this sneaker may not be to your liking. I also liked the heigth of the sole. I've tried other similar style sneakers where, because the sole was either too thick &/or high, made them uncomfortable but this pair was perfect for me in that area having more flexibility than other brands.I've not yet worn them for a long period of time but, should I find them to be less than expected, I will revise my review. But for right now the color, quality, style & comfort along with a very reasonable price & fast shipment all make this pair one of my favorites!",
