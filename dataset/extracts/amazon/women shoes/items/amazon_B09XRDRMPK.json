My favorite part about the shoes is that the toe are has more room than most athletic shoes I\u2019ve worn. They are well vented which prevents my feet from feeling hot after a long day of walking and standing. They are cute and ultra comfortable so 10/10 recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Do you know how sometimes when you buy a pair of shoes you have to walk around quite a bit to see if you like them? Well, not these! The minute I put these in my feet I was in love!! They are so comfortable!I love how I can literally slip them on if I need to, which I do often! They are great for walking, maybe a light jog on the treadmill, and would be great for someone who walks a lot at work or is taking a trip and needs a comfortable shoe to walk in. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t use these as athletic shoes, but to each their own.They run true to size, but are fairly wide and maybe not for someone with narrow feet.I am honestly thinking of getting myself another pair!!",

                "reviewText": "These sneakers are incredibly comfortable and have a smooth fabric interior lining and exterior mesh. The have good cushioning and keep your feet cool. They look nice and can be worn as athleisure wear. I wore them while traveling internationally and they looked good enough that I didn\u2019t stick out as a tourist. Still, my partner says they are \u201cnormcore\u201d style. I would not recommend these for any performance/strenuous walks or on uneven terrain. I sometimes wear these to walk my dogs and have almost twisted my ankles multiple times. This is because even if the shoe is properly fitted, the lining is so smooth your foot moves around in the shoe and in my case, the shoe rolled on my foot, causing me to land on the side of my foot. So, these are good for trips to the mall, weekend errands, or resting your feet after a strenuous workout (wearing different shoes) but not if you are actively moving or on uneven terrain, or are unsteady on your feet.",

The first few times they were a little tough to put on but now that I have wore them for awhile they slip on nicely.",
