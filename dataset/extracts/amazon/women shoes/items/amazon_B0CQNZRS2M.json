                "reviewText": "My wife picked these out, her response: I picked these sneakers for the high ankle stretch form, slip on\u2019s. The sneakers are clean looking if I wanted to wear with leggings or dress pants. I am a size 7-7.5 in shoes, I ordered a size 7.5, they are a comfortable fit with socks. The cushion platform has a height in the heel area, which is great for me as I wear heels during the day/week, the sneaker has a nice arch for me to switch from a heel to a sneaker. The material is durable and a perfect stretch. My only concern would be for the sole of the sneaker as it is more plastic than rubber and may not prevent slipping on certain surfaces. The sneakers are of fair value, and a space saver when packing for travel.",

                "reviewText": "I have recently started a new pt job that demands me to be on my feet the entire time and wearing all black shoes. This checked both boxes for color and potential foot support. On top of that these are very affordable. Considering I had to order them as part of a \"uniform\" I truly did not want to pay more than this. Upon first try on, I thought the mesh top of the shoe would not be supportive enough for my somewhat wide feet, however, they have been comfortable and my feet so far feel completely supported. I typically wear a size 7.5 shoe, but a size 8 in sneakers for gym workouts. I decided to order the size 7.5 and am glad I did because they fit perfectly. On top of that these are very lightweight. Happy to report that after three days of standing in these, my feet are still happy! Glad these worked out!!",

These are easy to slip on and off.Wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend these as running shoes, but they are very comfortable for walking around while out and about the neighborhood or while shopping. The insole is made from foam and has a very slight arch support. It can easily be removed and replaced with a more pronounced arch support insole if preferred. There is some good, comfortable room in the toe area.Hope these shoes last a long time. My shoe size is normally a size 8 and these fit to size.",

You don\u2019t have to worry about foot odor, and the anti-slip effect is very good. The only bad thing is the back heel. The air cushion seems to have no effect. The back heel is still a bit hard. If there is an air cushion effect, walking will be more comfortable. But for the price, I think it's unbeatable.",
