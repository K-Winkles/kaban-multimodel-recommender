                "reviewText": "These boots look great and are of excellent quality! However, the front part of the boot that goes around the ankle dug into my leg. The inside was very comfortable for the foot, but the ankle part would have rubbed a blister on my leg if I had worn them for long. Even with pants or leggings to buffer, it still was too uncomfortable for long-term wear. I would highly recommend this brand, as I've had other shoes from them with no issues, but I would not recommend this particular style of boot.",
