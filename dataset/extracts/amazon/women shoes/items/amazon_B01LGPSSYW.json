I can walk all over campus and work and not be in pain. Whenever mine wear out, I buy a new pair. I can get about 6-8 months of daily usage from them before the bottom wears out or the inside seam comes apart (happens on the tan pair). Highly recommend these from LifeStride.",

My \u2018Amazon recommended size\u201d for these were a 6.5 but I\u2019ve bought LifeStride numerous times and am consistently a 6 so that\u2019s what I ordered. The black pair fits fine, but the beige pair is way too big. I checked both boxes and both shoes to confirm they were size 6. As I read through the reviews, there was a mix of \u201cthey run big\u201d and \u201cthey run small\u201d which is understandable when the sizing amongst the same exact shoe but different colors is so inconsistent. The black pair seems to be reasonably comfortable though.",
