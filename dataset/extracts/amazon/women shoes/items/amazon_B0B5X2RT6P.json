I\u2019m hesitant when buying new oxfords because I tend to wear them out rather quickly because I put a lot of pressure on my heels. The heels on these look and feel pretty durable and sturdy. They seem like they will last quite a while! Another noteworthy thing to mention, this is also the first pair of oxfords I\u2019ve bought that didn\u2019t immediately crease the leather at the front of the shoe when walking in them. So far I\u2019m impressed given the price of these puppies lol.",
