Will pack nicely on my next trip. Due to the pointed toe and review suggestions I ordered a size 9 while I usually wear 8.5. The toes do not pinch and yet they are not too big or loose. Will have to see how they feel after wearing a day and waking around in them to know whether they have enough support or rub anywhere. If they do I will update this review. So far they are just as described and pictured. Very pleased so far.",

                "reviewText": "For $20, I\u2019m happy with them. I knew going into it not to expect high quality shoes. The positives: cute, fashionable shoe for a low price. The bottom sole has some slip resistance to it, so that\u2019s good. Negatives: the seam work seems like it might not last too long. I can foresee these tearing after extended wear. They aren\u2019t the most comfortable either. My feet kind of hurt from wearing them all day because there is NO support. But again, I knew when I bought them that this would most likely be the case.So overall, if you\u2019re looking for an affordable, cute pair of shoes, I would recommend. If your feet are sensitive to no support, I would not recommend. Last note, if you have wide feet, I would maybe size up. I\u2019m an 8 1/2, so that\u2019s what I ordered & I think because of the pointy toe, they felt really tight at first. After wearing them all day, they have stretched out a little, but I have very narrow feet.",

                "reviewText": "I have always had trouble when trying to buy large sized shoes as a woman. Yes, I do take a size 12 [UK], no I don't want a male style or something for a drag act. As a very tall woman I am in proportion and, at last, I can get shoes that fit.Amazon essentials fill my needs with great styles and choice of colours, all at sensible prices.Hopefully they keep up the range and I will no longer have to run the risk of childrens' sizes being delivered instead of adult or having to buy the most feminine male footwear that I can find.These fit well, look good and appear well made so should last well and didn't break the bank.",
