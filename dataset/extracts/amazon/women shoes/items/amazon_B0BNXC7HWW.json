                "reviewText": "Joking aside though - I bought these shoes so I could start walking more and keep my feet from being so sore. A few days after I got these I stubbed my little toe during the night on the way to the bathroom. It hurt but not the kind of hurt that makes your eyes water, nose run and leaves you shaking. So I thought maybe I snagged my toenail...eh no big deal. So I got up in the morning and got dressed in the dark and had to spend the day taking care of my grandpa so am normally on my feet doing chores and checking on him. I wore these shoes. I felt my toe during the day a few times but really didn't even think about it that much. I got home that evening and decided to check out my toe... holy crap was I surprised... my toe was 100% broken. It was purple and swollen all the way up my foot and the toe next door. I say all this because I did not feel any pain while on my feet with a broken toe in these shoes! They are roomy, but supportive, no pressure points anywhere and feel like you're walking on cloud. They are worth the price tag.",

I need a bigger toe-box, though the rest of my foot is slim. There is a second set of wholes on the top in order to provide a firm fit around the top rim of the shoe. (Look online for different ways to string your shoes.) Hokas are the way to go for stability when running/walking. Peace.",
