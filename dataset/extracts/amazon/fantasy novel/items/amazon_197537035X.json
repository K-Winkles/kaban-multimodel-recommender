That very world is about to be split in two, and the pair has no idea how to prevent it! As if things couldn\u2019t get any worse, Demonia picks that exact moment to make a grand appearance and threaten to obliterate Disboard. It\u2019ll take a hero to fight this despair with hope: Sora, Shiro, and the gang aren\u2019t exactly \u201cheroes\u201d\u2026but they\u2019ll head to the supposedly unbeatable Devil\u2019s Tower anyway to save the day!",
