The character design is top notch and I\u2019ve never seen movement like this in a graphic novel. It feels like an animated movie.Unfortunately the characters felt very one dimensional and I was told to be interested in them but I never was. The story was boring. I knew exactly what was going to happen and there was never any real agency. I know this was based on a myth and it felt like a myth being told around a campfire, good triumphs over evil and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s been done a million times and there was nothing to make this telling interesting or stand out. Also, I wish it was in color.This is a book I\u2019ll keep, but I\u2019ll never read it again and I won\u2019t recommend it to anyone unless someone just wants some really gorgeous art to look at.",

If I didn\u2019t know the story, maybe I would\u2019ve enjoyed this more. Lang made the story more epic than it was\u2014I get that\u2019s what happens with graphic novels, but maybe I\u2019m just too attached to the original. When you love something, it can be hard to read something else loosely based on it.The art was gorgeous, and I liked the new characters.
