                "reviewText": "\"Our lives are like a movie. In our own story we are the main character. In other people's story we may be a supporting character or a background character. Everyone influences our lives to different extents, and so we need to decide how we want to be reflected in everyone else's story.\"Really enjoyed this twisty fairytale maze. In the beginning, Olivia is with her sister shopping for wedding dresses. She meets this nosy woman who ascertains Olivia doesnt believe in happily ever after. This is dulled by previous experiences.Next thing we know, Olivia falls out of this window (trying to get a cat) and lands in this story book world. Here she finds out each time she wakes up its a different fairytale. However, she must end the story correctly and see it through or she repeats it over till she gets it right. There are also other ways to skip to another story. Little does she know there is a guy named Jerron subjected to the same thing. Oh and the nosy woman is there too. There's also a helpful wolf and a evil prince. Do they ever get out? Find love? Readers will be awarded a whimsical voyage. This book is what dreams are made of.",
