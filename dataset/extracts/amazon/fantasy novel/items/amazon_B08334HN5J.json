Truly fantasy with some unique takes on the motivations of both villains and heroes. I loved that the predictable romance was a slow burn and kept my anticipating. There were some surprises, too! It's really hard to take me off- guard. I keep it general when I review a book as to not give away much, so let me just say the vivid description of people and places will truly make you feel like you know these characters and see these settings. Really good read!",

                "reviewText": "Mageborn is a perfect example of how new life can be breathed into old cliches. There's nothing unusual about this book in terms of its themes, plot or characters - orphan girl searching for her past and her purpose, handsome and brooding prince with untold power, societal class feud between those with magic and those without, and the magic system itself, where users can control one element or aspect such as fire, water or music.\ud83e\ude9eYet it still felt fresh and exciting, a cleverness that came not from original ideas but how they were woven together. Tension and loss and hope and discovery - the world was rich and the characters inspiring. It was a truly phenomenal first half or so, and I was ready to give it five stars.\ud83e\ude9eUnfortunately it only gets four, because of this little thing called 'romance'. And yeah, sue me, but it makes me grumpy when it doesn't feel natural to either the characters or the plot, and this was one of those. This exciting tale of political scandal, magical exploitation, the almost-rape of a royal prince, chases through tunnels and streets and...oh yeah, lots of gazing into each other's eyes adoringly. Heartfelt declarations. Descriptions of how the other completes them. Meaningless sacrifices and boring paragraphs when to me, the romance should have been only secondary to the action. It deflated the tension and undermined the climax, and I felt a little let down after such a great build up.\ud83e\ude9eThere were also a few moments where things were either over-explained to death, or entirely under-explained/inconsistent. It was as if huge chunks of text had been edited out after reading, and sometimes I struggled to understand things that may be presumed obvious by the writer, while others were coloured as 'revelations' when I could have sworn we'd found out about them several chapters earlier.\ud83e\ude9eA good book, but with the potential to be a great one. But the author's writing style and imagination may be enough to entice me back for the sequel...",

Loved the enemy and storyline.But it all was WASTED with two of the weakest pussies I've ever read in a book! He's supposed to be the most powerful mage in the land- ok. So he has family issues, and can't remember his life before 6 or 10 years ago. You\u2019d think he would know who he can trust by now. He let's people hurt him, come on to him, betray him, drug him, use magic on him, try to assassinate him and he gives them all these ways out.He never gets mad and kicks butt. He rethinks it over and lets it continue.A randy queen who won't take no and he's just sitting there letting her crawl on him and drug him.And the heroine, Grace- gawd- get that so called spine of yours and drag him out of there. Stand up to Kane, the Queen, Do something! Both of them dumb as rocks, get a fing plan.I know I'm ranting a bit too hard, it's just if they're so all powerful then injustice right in front of their faces should not be allowed regardless of who is behind it.I kept wishing that the hero would bitxhslap the queen and punch out Kane and woe to anyone who backed them. But ...no. they always played by the rules made by other people. Bad people.Fyi - I'm only at 60% but I will finish because I love romance fantasy between magical couples.",

                "reviewText": "So we have a story about a magical race that are collared an indentured to non-magicals. History, though most brush it off as a mere story, say it is done to protect everyone. Until those without magic find a way to steal it for power and sheer entertainment. Thus story has a hero, two even, but they've been so afraid and controlled their entire lives, they are unable to rise up and protect those who need them the most. The story concept was interesting, but I'd have preferred more information on the Hollow King to understand things better.",

If you need an intro to fantasy and looking for an easy read, this is for you. If you\u2019re a avid reader, this book is a quick read with not a lot of substance.",

                "reviewText": "This book couldn\u2019t have been more up my street if it had been written specifically with me in mind. It is full of all my favourite things, and to cap it all, it\u2019s the first book in what promises to be an excellent series.I know there is a lot of debate about prologues, but I love them, and the one in this book positively drips with sinister images and intrigue. I was hooked from page one and couldn\u2019t put it down!There are so many wonderful characters in this book who, despite the fantastical setting, remain deeply human and relatable, each flawed in their own way. Jessica Thorne\u2019s skill at creating these characters meant that my heart broke for one character despite only having known them for a few pages. Bastien is a character that led to many conflicting emotions that I obsessed over like a teenage fangirl even when I wasn\u2019t reading. I fell for him at first sight, and desperately wanted to discover that he was not the feared Lord of Thorns, but was in fact misunderstood, but I have been hurt by literary characters before who turned out to not be what they seemed after I fell for them, and I was scared that Bastien was going to turn out the same way. Whether he did or not, I will leave for you to find out for yourself.I loved the premise of magic being outlawed for the masses, but stolen and treated as a game by the nobility. I loved all the twists and turns, and non-stop action.",
