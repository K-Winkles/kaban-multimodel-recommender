I could see the colors, feel the wind and hear the sounds. I think that is what makes a good book, good. Aside from that this book is ubique, I know I say this a lot but, but I really can't compare it to anything I have seen before.Now, let me talk about that ending without giving spoilers. That ending oh my god. I just couldn't stop myself from screaming \"Noooo Whit\" I can't wait for the second one.",

                "reviewText": "This was a 4-star and not a 5-star for me only because it was YA, and I'm not *exactly* within that target demographic. BUT, if you're reading the book synopsis and wondering if you, a fellow 30+ year-old, still want to read this, I strongly recommend you do. This book convinced me that I can still enjoy YA; that's how amazingly it was written.In this story, we Follow Inez, an 18-year-old venturing from Argentina to Egypt to discover the truth behind her parent's death. Isabel Iba\u00f1ez did a genuinely stunning job in this book of both giving us a strong, determined female lead we can root for but also reminding us that this takes place in another time where that was not necessarily seen as a good thing and brought with it it's own set of challenges.The magic system was such a refreshing take on hidden magic within our world; instead of magic linked to people, it's connected to objects, with some of those having unique (and funny) abilities.The romance: There IS a romance in this book, and while it does help drive the story, it isn't the focus. The romance is a cute, slow-burn that focuses on the tension between the two characters. This is true YA, there is no spice. It is appropriate for the 12-17 age range, and I would have loved it at that age.",

The story is clearly not over, but the betrayal at the end was unforgivable, and I am choosing to believe that it is not what it seems, I have to because I can\u2019t reconcile what he did!I really loved feeling like I was transported back in time to 1884 Egypt, it was magical. And Inez was such a strong character who wasn\u2019t going to let the fact that she was a women hold her back in that time either. Her banter with Whit was also amazing, only because she didn\u2019t hold back like was proper for the time. Their snarky attitudes and comebacks were so easy back and forth (it really did remind me of the banter in The Mummy, Brendan Fraser of course, there is only one correct answer). She truly surprised him with her forwardness. They had all the tension, the forbidden romance, forced proximity, he has a haunting past and secrets (which we still don\u2019t know about), she manages to get past his defenses to see beyond the guard he puts up.I don\u2019t want to give too much away, but Inez has to travel to Egypt after she learns that her parents have been pronounced dead after disappearing in the dessert on a dig. She has to get answers to what happened, and nothing is as it seems in this book. She ends up traveling to her uncle, who worked on the archaeological digs with her parents, and helps him search for Cleopatra\u2019s tomb. It was filled with action, and suspense, and a mystery that is still needing to be solved in book two!\u201cI missed his touch even though I hadn\u2019t felt it\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t just pretend that you don\u2019t feel it.

INEZ WHAT ARE YOU THINKING should be the whole blurb. i couldn\u2019t put this down. did i finish it at work? if you\u2019re my employer, no of course not i was diligently reading emails and answering phone calls. there was a \u201ctouch her and die\u201d moment and i was literally kicking my heels and squealing.this has everything. murder! hidden tombs! magic! mystery! if that\u2019s not enough for you i don\u2019t know what will be. it\u2019s pitched as the mummy meets death on the nile and hoooo boy does it hold up. i will be thinking about this for a long time which is good since we have no release date for book two. say a prayer for me.anyways. it\u2019s incredibly written, there\u2019s character development, a heroine who is very much like evelyn from the mummy. whip smart and little too independent for her own good. i love her. there\u2019s a rake who\u2019s forbidden to fall for her. cleopatra!! i figured out one twist but there are so many other plot lines that don\u2019t feel quite tied up so i cannot wait for book 2.also. a small detail: the chapter numbers were in spanish and we know that inez is most comfortable speaking in spanish even though she\u2019s incredibly talented and speaks multiple languages, it\u2019s just a very nice touch that makes you feel like she really is the narrator. if that makes sense.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

The book has been marketed toward fans of \u201cThe Mummy\u201d and it\u2019s such a clever comparison, because this novel captures the romance and adventure of a period piece, much like the film does. I cannot wait for rest of the story.",
