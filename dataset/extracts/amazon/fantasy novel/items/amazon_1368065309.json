So, if you purchase one, I'd suggest flipping through the pages looking for duplication.",

                "reviewText": "The problem with this book was not discovered until the book had been read by several of my students who all told me the book was hard to follow and made no sense.I buy hardcover books from my own funds to put books that are new interesting in my classroom for my students to read and discuss. There are no school funds to acquire non-academic material for my class anymore so I buy these books with my own money. This is an excellent story for my students to discuss and compare with their own experiences and expectations. Books like this help me to make everything a learning experience.The defect in this book was caused by the misprinting of 5 pages being duplicated in the last half of the book. If the problem was just 5 extra pages, it would not be a big problem because the 5 extra pages could have been ignored by the reader.In this book however, the problem is that the 5 \"extra pages\" were printed in place of the 5 pages that actually belonged there.The missing pages caused the story to be missing a great portion of the narrative and made it impossible to follow the story. The \"extra\" pages follow the correct location by exactly 2 pages. This is simply a message to warn you to check the copy of this book you have purchased so you can return it within the time limit if it is defective. Because of the way modern printing machines operate it is likely that the printing operation prints several copies worth of pages at a time and that only one group of pages from the many that are printed may have this problem. I found this error after comparing the hardcover version of this book with the softcover version after my students complained about the book being difficult to read.",
