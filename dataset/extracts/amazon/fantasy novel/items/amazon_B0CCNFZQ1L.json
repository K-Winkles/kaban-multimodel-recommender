I was like sure why not and watched it with him over dinner. By episode 4 I was fully invested and wanted to read to find out what happens next. Luckily I've been getting his these volumes every year so I was able to catch up to Volume 8 pretty quick. I never thought I'd be talking about Solo Leveling with my hubby but yeah. It's a great series, MC scenes always gives me goosebumps. The leveling is very believable and nothing feels forced or rushed. Story is amazinggg. And some people love drama, but I don't, I never did. I'm actually really happy MC doesn't have overly emotional struggles or moral dilemmas about hunting and glad that he's straightforward and accepts everything as they come. Can't wait to keep watching this amazing series come to life in the anime!",
