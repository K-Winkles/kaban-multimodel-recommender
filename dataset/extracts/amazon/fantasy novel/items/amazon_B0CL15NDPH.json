        "description": "Goblins are the weakest of the monsters, with only numbers in their favor. No warrior would dedicate himself to their eradication\u2014except for Goblin Slayer. As his reputation spreads, a quest comes from none other than the Supreme God's own archbishop\u2014Sword Maiden, the Gold-ranked adventurer renowned for defeating a Demon Lord. The former hero brings a report of goblins beneath the flourishing, peaceful water town, followed by a plea for Goblin Slayer and his companions to investigate, since no one else will. Searching the catacombs beneath the town, though, the party discovers that the trouble runs far deeper than any of them realized. How are all these goblins entering the city? And why is Sword Maiden so desperate...?PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio. Read more",

People will try to change our Goblin Slayer, but even so - his priorities remain the same and his Goblin-slaying remains a constant work of art. Recommendable to anyone who enjoyed the first novel and knows what they're getting into - some of the art is a little risque, and some of the story's plot seems to incorporate this, alongside bloody, massacred Goblins and other strange creatures, but if you haven't seen the first novel - I can't say going straight to the second is wise.I look forward to the third's release. A-Goblin-Slaying we must go!~Ah, and to a certain extent; the amount of maidens falling into our Slayer's neglected harem continues to grow. Be warned - he's denser than even the most dedicated dwarves.",

The interactions with the characters, the views on who Goblin Slayer is, what he means, and how much impact he has on people becomes noticeably mindblowing as you, the reader, become enthralled with this light novel. My only regret is at the speed i read this novel that leaves me with a satisfying smile for a story that I cannot wait to buy the Manga (Even if it might make my wallet weep).To the author, my thanks for the smiles, the horrors, the thrills, and triumph that shows how much work you have placed in this series.

Predictable and utterly enjoyable, I also loved the changing perspective of Goblin Slayer as he goes from being a lone wolf, to the defacto leader of his own group of Adventurers.

The story is told a bit differently then last time but I enjoyed it just the same. I cannot wait for the next volume to come out!

Siempre y cuando se trate de goblins.Una nueva mision ha sido presentada al gremio, pero esta vez solicitan directamente a nuestro protagonista, el remitente no es mas que la legendaria hero\u00edna de rango oro Sword Maiden.En este volumen la trama esta centrada en esta mision, el desarrollo de los personajes es mas notorio, particularmente Goblin Slayer el cual es mas abierto e incluso involuntariamente sarc\u00e1stico, otro punto que resalto es la presencia de fanservice, el cual es bastante notorio pero no tan abrumador como en otras obras.Recuerden estar siempre alerta y reportar cualquier actividad goblin a su gremio mas cercano o directamente a Goblin Slayer, que actualmente se encuentra en una misi\u00f3n de patrulla seria.",
