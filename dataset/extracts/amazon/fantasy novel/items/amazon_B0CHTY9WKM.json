                "reviewText": "Amber's brilliantly woven story comes to an epic and very satisfying conclusion in Destiny of a Witch.Yes, Amber tears down and destroys the evil witches, not without some pain and sadness, but with the work of her many friends and supporters at her side, they overcome and it's marvelous.I've really loved the slow-burn, enemies to lovers romance, between Amber and Bastion with this book detailing what a strong and lovely pair they are and will continue to be. I've said it before, but I'll say it again... Heather is a master storyteller and Amber's story has shown us the best of her skills. Amber\u2019s character has grown so much since we first met her in Jinx's books.My favorite side character is still Benji, and I still want to give him a hug and introduce him to some 80's rock. Heather makes characters, like Benji, feel so utterly real and you can't help to cheer on and race through their adventures to be sure they made it safely to the final page (but seriously, how many times does my favorite side character need to almost die?).",

This is the fourth book in the series, and as such it is not a standalone: yes you need to have read the other books first, and preferably both Jinx and Lucy\u2019s series too.It\u2019s down to the wire for Amber and Bastion, as they start their hunt for the leaders of the Evil Coven.Amber is still trying to help her mother, just as she is trying to stop those who want to use the evil magic, fortunately she has managed to gather some good friends who are willing to help.Without trying to spoiler things, let\u2019s just say we get some names, as well as some answers in this book, and I was quite satisfied with where it all lead.It was an action packed book, with Amber and Bastion having their work cut out for them. Amber is finally coming into her own, and making waves while she does it!There were some nice cameos from Lucy and Jinx - and even Esme got to make me smile.All in all, this one ended with a bit of a bang, and a rather happy/satisfied smile from me. Well worth the effort of reading the series, the urban fantasy enthusiast will find themselves enthralled by the story.",

                "reviewText": "Heather Harris has done it again! Reading Amber\u2019s tale makes me feel like I can achieve anything and I am determined to start every day with a positive affirmation too!The story itself is full of twists and turns and it is difficult to keep track of whom is friend or foe! It is a well paced story that demands to be read in a single sitting! It was also wonderful to have a leading woman who was in her forties, not her twenties, and still being a kick-ass hero! I\u2019m hoping that despite this being the end of this series that there will be more stories with Amber and Bastion; after all, as Amber said, there are still more evil witches (love the rebranding) to be rooted out!Thank you, Heather Harris, for another excellent read!",

Although they can be read as individual series I would suggest reading each series in order.Some triggers including suicide, kidnapping, violence+, betrayal, dementiaI loved the humour of the main characters and the 'cup quotes'. The spice is implied but not really described so is only \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f",
