Over the winter, this is going to be used - one way or another - to prepare myself for my fourth novel and for the series that comes after it - possibly in juxtaposition so that I can see where there are parallels and where there are not.",

I am excited to try it this way and see if the process doesn't work better for me - maybe I can actually finish something lol...The only way this could be better was if it were spiralbound and organized into sections with tabs so that when you get to the writing process, you can more easily find your details.

For example, rather than a book on worldbuilding that says \u201chere is how I create religions for my stories\u201d this book simply includes several sections for you to work, dividing the religion into smaller subcategories such as creation myth and pantheon, so that you can flesh out your world in your own way.Once again, THIS IS NOT A GUIDE, IT IS A WORKBOOK.

                "reviewText": "I've seen a number of smug '5-star' reviewers putting the onus of this rort on the buyers, for 'not reading the blurb' or simply missing that it's in the word 'workbook'. Have you Googled 'what is a workbook'? Have you looked at the very first definition of the word in the dictionary? If you had, you'd see what I did before purchasing;noun1. a student's book containing instruction and exercises relating to a particular subject.2. a worker's manual.3. a booklet outlining a course of study.Sure there are other definitions which fit what this workbook actually is (an empty vessel of pages for people to write in), but when there are multiple definitions of something, which vastly differ from each other, it's very important to make the distinction as unambiguous as possible. There are many ways the author could have done this, like showing photos of the actual content inside the pages for example, or at least explicitly stating that there is virtually no semblance of content in it's pages.The fact that there was no attempt at clarity, makes it painfully apparent that the author was intentionally vague and deceitful with their wording and omissions, to prey on those who would be convinced by the reassurance of the flamboyant title.\"Contents include in-depth...\" is the closest the description gets to outright lying to it's audience, as it is a stretch of the imagination to consider anything about the book's prompts to be anything other than rudimentary.Although the money wasted on this book was little concern to me, I feel deeply saddened at the thought of someone less fortunate forking out for this outrageously overpriced, over glorified pile of scrap paper. I hope the author one day wakes up on their bed of money and struggles to stomach their reflection in the mirror.\"If dignity was money, you could maybe buy a soda\".",
