He befriends Holga, a human warrior, and together they raise Kira as a small family. He will also meet Forge, an older human who will also join the group. Together they take on a small quest and are joined by Simon, a half-elf sorcerer who will lead them to their biggest score yet: the mansion of a renowned Wizard.But things are not what they seem, and the party they attend is a reunion the likes of nobody's ever seen. Magic, music and puzzles are just the start of a fantastic tale that will have them battling one of the greatest monsters of the pantheon.Written in a fast and fun way, the novel is full of action, but also depth for the characters, and narrates the transformation of a group of unknowns into a small family. It's a great way for you to get immersed, or rekindle your passion for the fantastic world of Forgotten Realms and I can't wait for the movie to be released.Recommended!",

This is not the case, here. Not only are the characters faithful to their onscreen performances, they are faithful to the source material and concepts behind them.The author does not overburden us with descriptions and the backstories are good enough that you get a sense of the characters and feel invested in them, while leaving you wanting to know more about them, and look forward to seeing their further adventures. They are fleshed out very well.I would definitely look forward to reading more, if the author was authorized to make a series for these characters, as I do not feel anything was taken away from the movie or would be taken away, by doing so.As another note, the author was quite failthful to the Forgotten Realms setting and that impressed me, as well.",
