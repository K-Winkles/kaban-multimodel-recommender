                "reviewText": "This is a lovely youth appropriate graphic novel that both my 4 year old and I both enjoyed. It's one of the only books my kid has asked to read repeatedly. I would absolutely give this as a gift to older kids as well. I was a huge fan of ElfQuest as a young adult and was searching for a graphic novel that my 4 year old may enjoy, but without the nudity or as much violence. Lightfall was exactly what I was looking for to excite the very big imagination of my young, story loving kid. There are some \"scary\" parts (a shadowy bird figure named Kest), which depending on your little readers may scare them too much, but kids around 7 and up, I doubt it would be too scary. My 4 year old is kind of hard to scare. We also bought the 2nd book. It was wonderful as well. We look forward to all sequels!If you're looking for ideas for graphic novels for your little reader: I also tried graphic novels such as the Giants Beware series, Wings of Fire, CatStronauts and more. Lightfall beat all others we tried for my kid so far. Giants Beware series came in close though. He lost interest in Wings of Fire I think because there was too much going on, but maybe great when he's older. Had we found Hilda before Netflix made it into a show, I think he would have loved Hilda as a graphic novel maybe as much as Lightfall too.",

The story in brief concerns a young girl who lives with her adopted grandfather who is a somewhat forgetful wizard and ... a pig. Whilst she is on an errand in the magical ancient forest in which she and her grandfather make thier home she gets into a bit of a sticky situation and learns that sarcasm is probably not a good way of asking for help. Fortunately she is rescued by the larger than life Cadwallader a Galdurian looking for her grandfathers help in finding all the other Galdurians. Unfortunately when they get home her grandfather has left! And so 'high ho Bilbo AWAAAAY!' they are off on a quest to find the magic pig. The whole book is charming, it is deeply pervaded with a sense of wonder and a complex back story. Unfortunately the story is just the first episode of several, so get your finger out Mr Probert. A wonderful story for young women with a sense of adventure and elderly gentlemen with similar.",
