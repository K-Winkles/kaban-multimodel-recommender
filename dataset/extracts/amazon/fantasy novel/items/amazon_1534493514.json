                "reviewText": "Originally I was on the hunt for more LGBTQ+ books to read and I saw this and read that it involved witches. Two subject matters that I dearly adore and decided to pick it up! Despite these being my sole reason for starting this book, I found that the story offered a lot more which made it an enjoyable read. All of the main 4 characters are oozing charm and their interactions with one another really make them feel alive.If I had any issues it is that they didn't discuss the backstories of one of the other important characters in the book. They mentioned and talked about where they came from and strongly alluded/displayed that they were something far greater but it was never touched upon or explored. There was a time in the book when this character told our main character, Ranka, about their life in their homeland but we the audience didn't learn anything about them, we the audience were merely told that he told her stories. So we weren't given any details which I feel cheated out of. Though this is really minor in the overall story, just something I really wanted to know. Though if there was a sequel I would gladly pick it up in hopes that it did mention or focus its story on that character.I would highly recommend this book, it's a good story with solid characters and the artwork of the cover was so dreamy. I found myself imagining the whole book in that art style which really added to the experience in my opinion. (I know the style of the cover may not be important but this is how I ended up reading it and it played a crucial role in how I read the book.)",

                "reviewText": "Ranka has known for a while now that she'll have to move south to marry the human prince, but she doesn't want to-- she doesn't want to leave her coven, she doesn't want to leave her home, and she doesn't want to reduce herself to the weapon she's been trained to be. But when her closest friend goes missing-- yet another witch mistaken for Ranka-- she embraces her duty. She'll go south, marry the prince, kill him, and rescue her friend in the process. But when she gets to Isodal, she finds a prince and princess at odds with her expectations of them. And there's something else, a rot that's brewing in the city, a concentration of the plague that's targeting witches all over the country. Ranka is forced to make a decision: work with the twin heirs to the throne in their pursuit to better the world, or work with the witches back home in theirs.From the beginning, I absolutely loved this book. Ranka's blood magic is fascinating and heartbreaking, and her position in both her coven and the world isolates her while elevating her above everyone else. The world, the magic, and the characters are lush, while being grounded in problems that feel very real. The group of people at the castle-- Ranka, the royal twins (Galen and Aramis), and Percy, the ambassador from one of the isles-- have a really wonderful dynamic that made me both laugh and cry at various moments.The Ones We Burn also does a beautiful job at tackling abuse, and what it means when the people we're close with, the people we love, the people who are supposed to love us, hurt us for their own gain. There are a few lines in particular that are exactly the words I wish someone had said to me years ago, and reading them both broke my heart and inspired me to keep choosing myself, to keep telling myself that I deserve to heal. The Ones We Burn is a fun read, but it is also a deeply powerful one, and I will forever be grateful to Rebecca Mix for writing it, and for putting it out into the world.",

                "reviewText": "I was interested in LGBT fantasy novels and this one fit the bill perfectly. The witch covens have a weak peace treaty with the human based upon the witches offering up their strongest as wife to the king. A new king is to be crowned, and Ranka is the one to be offered.The entire story remains focused on this root conflict which helped keep it constantly moving forward and not meandering between a dozen different threads.While I enjoyed the story itself, the writing (specifically the editing) could have been better. My pet peeve with writing is when authors use the same phrases repeatedly, and while not super common, I was definitely pulled out of the moment a few times by it with this book. Everyone is \"holding back bile\" or cutting things into \"smaller and smaller pieces\".Still worth a read if you want a self contained novel with magic, violence, and people struggling to find what the right thing to do is.",

                "reviewText": "Ranka will live in my heart forever.This book was exquisite. The exposition between monstrosity, gentleness, and vulnerability after abuse was so beautifully done, and Ranka\u2019s slow unraveling towards her realization of the things she endured was so perfectly paced and agonizingly explored.It\u2019s so evident that this is a story from Rebecca\u2019s very bones, from some well of experience and passion deep inside her.This book is a rare jewel. \ud83e\udd7a one written not just by a highly skilled author, but one who is also so passionate and invested in the story they're telling. This book will stay with me for the rest of my life, and while I wish I\u2019d had it when I was younger\u2026 oh, I\u2019m so glad I have it now.Note: I chose not to cancel my preorder but instead read this book critically after the infamous accusations of racism. Y\u2019all\u2026 there\u2019s just\u2026 no racism in here? I\u2019m honestly so confused? There\u2019s no black vs white theme, no atrocities committed against white peoples by black peoples; (minor, vague spoiler to follow) the twins are barely in control of their own city, and many of the dark and terrible things that happen are committed by white people pulling the strings behind the scenes.If you\u2019ve been on the fence about this book for that reasoning, please give it a chance\u2014 read it thoughtfully and make that choice for yourself. I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019ll be disappointed.",
