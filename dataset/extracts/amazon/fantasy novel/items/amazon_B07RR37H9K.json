        "description": "A Compendium Of Fantasy Writing Tips, Tools, Prompts, Help And AdviceWhen you buy this book you'll also get:Free access to a writing class on how to write a fantasy novel (worth $25)An invitation to our fantasy writing group (Discord) with 500+ membersWriting fantasy can be a liberating experience. Writers are free to create their own worlds, magic systems and creatures. But for many, the scale of the task can be daunting.Writing fantasy fiction is much harder than other genres because you need to take care of so many more elements\u2014intricate worldbuilding, creating compelling characters, and tying everything together in a satisfying plot.And then there are the nuances between subgenres. Writing urban fantasy, for example, is much different to epic fantasy, and writing fantasy novels can be more complex than scribbling short stories.There can be so many questions, the answers so hard to find, that you just want to give up. But worry not, for help is at hand in the form of this comprehensive fantasy writing guide.A Fantasy Writers' Handbook is the guidebook I wanted when I first began writing fantasy fiction. It covers three main areas:Writing Fiction Generally \u2013 how to make characters, come up with a plot and theme, how to write dialogue, tips on writing fight scenes and battles, and advice on dealing with mental challenges, like procrastinationEpic Fantasy Writing Tips \u2013 worldbuilding, making monsters, guides on the likes of medieval swords, bows and arrows, and armour, and tips on subgenres, like writing urban fantasy and romantasyGetting Published \u2013 list of publishers of short and long fantasy fiction, how to write a cover letter, how to make a website.Above all, this fantasy writing guide offers an accessible take on some complex areas of the craft and has, over the years, been credited with helping budding writers land book deals and short story credits.About The AuthorRichie Billing is an author of a range of story types, though his passion is writing fantasy fiction, as well as helping his fellow writers follow their own passions and dreams.Richie's debut epic fantasy novel, the rip-roaring underdog story called Pariah's Lament, was published in 2021.Richie's move into education began as a blog to share helpful writing tips he learned as he studied the craft, and soon became a website visited by over 150,000 people a year. This led him to write his acclaimed craft book, A Fantasy Writers' Handbook, and begin the podcast, The Fantasy Writers' Toolshed, which many writers credit with inspiring them to finish their stories.Richie also teaches creative writing in his home city of Liverpool, as well as online, and occasionally speaks at writing conventions. Most nights you can find him scribbling away or watching the NBA.Praise For A Fantasy Writers' Handbook\"Very useful. Helped me land my first book deal.\" Jack Shannon, Fantasy Author\"Written in a friendly, uncluttered style, Billing has managed to accumulate and present a huge amount of useful information in a way that perhaps a favourite lecturer might do.\" Readers' Favourite\"An ideal, accessible source for tips and advice and practical resources for the aspiring fantasy author.\" Steph Warren, Vine Voice Amazon reader\"I loved how Billing included examples and advice from other authors like one of my favourites, Brandon Sanderson.\" Sarah Lillian Books",

I ordered it used and it was shipped within a week, and arrived in perfect condition without notes in the margins.For context, I have already had a few creating writing courses. This book does go back over a few beginning writing steps, but even so I found they were a refreshing perspective. There is reference to social media and the help of creative writers groups that I think blends well into the examples. This has turned out to be the accumulative and inspiring book that you might hope The Guide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction by Philip Athans might be. I found that, that book was a very simplistic introduction to the genre.A Fantasy Writer's Handbook would pair very well with Putting the Fact In Fantasy, a collection of essays with writing resources and character and world building prompts blended in. These two books have been what I was looking for to gear myself in the direction of writing fantasy and fairy tale.The word glean is used a lot. I feel like Holden Caulfield. I can't stand the use of that word. I cringe every time.",

The first half of this book summarizes and synthesizes current literary advice for a publishable, successful and infinitely more readable novels. Despite comments to the contrary, this book goes beyond the article's on the author's web site by adding insightful and exceptionally useful details on the craft of modern fiction. Sections on setting your premise and the easy to understand explanation of active voice had an immediate impact on my work.The second half of the book is focused on the Fantasy genre and its many sub-genres with useful instructions on world-building and handling complex fight scenes, as well as the mundane such as typical word counts, editing chores and formatting a manuscript. If this is your genre, pay close attention to the list of publishers, which is very current as well as the information on writing a cover letter and the currently available marketing methods in our industry.Salted with pithy and relevant quotes and excellent references to continue your education, this manual is a great tool. Every aspiring author should own it.",
