We were all enraptured and stayed up FAR too late night after night sneaking in another chapter. The writing is beautifully crafted with tons of imagery and sensory details that helped us to imagine Eliana's world. We loved tracking the breadcrumbs of clues that Findley Evans left and trying to infer and predict which would be important and what would happen next. The characters were brave and big-hearted risk takers-- the kinds I hope my own children grow up to be.",

The Dragon and the Girl: True North would have been one of my choices for a read aloud or for literature circles. I loved it! Not only was the story compelling, but the writing was stellar! Laura Findley Evans has created well-drawn characters that you care about from the beginning, as well as a villain who oozes evil. I cannot wait for more adventures with Eliana and Winston!",
