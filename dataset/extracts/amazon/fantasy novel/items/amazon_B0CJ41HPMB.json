                "reviewText": "Before I start talking about the book itself, I do want to point out for future readers that only about 44% of the book is part of the eight volume story. About 35% roughly is a collection of bonus short stories that all seem to take place after. The remaining miscellaneous % is the ever growing appendix. I feel that MXTX books are often misleading because 20% or more is usually the appendix and the last volume of each series seems to be 50% or less actual mainline story.The content making up the mainline story really does wrap it up well but also didn't feel like a full book. It was definitely necessary to finish the story, but it also felt like it could have just been tacked onto the previous volume and it would have been fine. It just didn't have enough substance to warrant a whole new volume. That being said, there are moments that just emotionally punch you. There's one particular moment that made me cry so much I had to put the book down and walk away for a while. Very moving...I was actually surprised by the selection of bonus chapters at the end. With MXTX previous series she usually has at least one or two adult rated contents chapters at the end. Usually those chapters leave me feeling mixed feelings because they don't tend to be very loving, often a little violent and or painful... So I've been feeling low level anxiety waiting to see what bonus content she was going to put in this one. I was surprised that she did not include anything graphic. She sort of does this hand waving thing where it's acknowledged that our beloved main characters have relations but she just doesn't go into the details. Personally, I think this was a bit of a relief for me. I don't know if she could write lovemaking scene that I felt would match the gentle loving devotion that Crimson Rain would demonstrate. Instead, we get multiple chapters of the two of them just enjoying life and adventures together. I think it was just fine. One of the bonus chapters, the one about the statues, had me laughing so hard that I had to take breaks for my eyes to clear up enough to read, I just couldn't stop crying from laughter! I think the bonus chapters in this volume for this series were well worth the time.I confess that I am very sad that this is the last volume. I deeply wish there was more to their story, it would be nice to have another long adventure for them. One that didn't have to focus so much from the struggle for them to be a couple. But maybe that would just dilute the beauty of their story if we didn't have an ending. I guess there's a sadness left behind in my heart because this is the end. This banquet is over.",
