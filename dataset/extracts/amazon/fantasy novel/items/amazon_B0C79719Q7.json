I actually went back and looked at book two to make sure I hadn't forgotten something only to realize there really are missing chapters of information. Once I got over that, I just moved on with the story like it didn't matter. And I guess it really didn't matter... And there's a lot of hand waving over those missing months worth of time in the book. I think the author might have been just bored with that arc. The stuff she did get to is quite great though. I couldn't stop laughing, the characters are delightful. I do hate the sudden ending cliffhanger though. It almost feels like it ended mid-sentence. I almost feel like recommending waiting for book four before you start reading this one... But then again it was really good and if people all wait for book four book for might never come out right?",

They are finally on the same page, yet have misunderstood each other which is driving the secondary characters to go crazy. I am so happy how they wrote in the OG FL and how true love breaks spells. Some truths will come to light and we get more scenes of the fairies which I absolutely love.",

But it apparently didn\u2019t made the cut and died a sad death.Yet they always reference the book they transmigrated and did things that us reader don\u2019t know about. And how the ML builds his relationship with Scarlet inside the book that we still don\u2019t know about \ud83d\ude20It\u2019s tasteless.Besides that, we finally see Scarlett realize she has romantic feelings for the ML and how she dealt the baron. OG female lead finally makes an appearance. And we see our main characters flirting.In short, it\u2019s still an interesting tale but we no longer get the comedic tone as we did in the first volume. Author skipping a whole arc that showed character development as well a new character (the cleric) that was with them in the arc she skip \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0fWelp until the next volume, I guess",
