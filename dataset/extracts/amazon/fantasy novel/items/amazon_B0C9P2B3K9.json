And thank you whoever decided to display this intimate art in such a discreet way! It added a deeper truth to that part of the story. I am not sure how to describe the sounds that came with my spontaneous reaction at the discovery. The pleasantly of it amazed. I will definitely let other readers discover this treasure for themselves and hope that they do. It is such a gem!The whole story is magical and I so enjoyed Patricks exploration with his children that inspired the refining of The Lightning Tree. Thank you Patrick for another wonderful read!!",

I love how intertwined it is and how he teaches some very serious life lessons. It's a good reminder to \"be careful of what you ask for.\" The story is has a subtle warning, but it is forgiving and sweet at the same time (I love the part about the kitten). I enjoy the concepts wrought in the mind of Pat Rothfuss. He infuses his characters with life and motive so quickly. I feel he actually breathes life into them and sends them on their way. I don't know how to describe it, this power to create. He has been blessed wth an incredible gift. Even his blog is a joy to read. Amazing!",

I can remember buying the anthology just for that Bast story. So in one way this is old material.In so far as the new-and-improved aspect, it has a few things going for it. First, he did change some things/words a bit. Other reviewers give some very good concrete examples of the revisions; I'm not going to get into that here. Next, this story is a little longer than \"The Lightning Tree\". In the Forward, Rothfuss said it's 15k words longer. Third, the illustrations made this worthwhile. I really enjoyed those! The illustrator did a great job. And finally, Rike. I really felt a lot of compassion for that boy.After reading the Afterword, I really doubt that we'll be seeing Doors of Stone anytime soon. I had hoped that working on this would have put him in the right frame of mind, but it really doesn't sound like it's going well book-wise. I'm still glad that I bought this book.",

But, in some ways, I think I would be just as happy to hang out with Patrick Rothfuss, share a meal, maybe play a board game. I especially recommend the author\u2019s notes if you are one of those awesome parents that read to your children. I read a The Name of the Wind, The Wise Man\u2019s Fear, and The Slow Regard of Silent Things to my kids, eliding some of the overtly adult themes from the first two. They absolutely loved them. Had this been available at the time, we would have read it, and they would have loved it. Sad to say, they are quasi-adults now, and are more enamored of screens than books, but I think this might prove to be the exceptional exception.",

                "reviewText": "I have enjoyed Rothfuss's work to this point.This novella is no exception; however, the use of passive voice here slowed down the story sometimes. (There were also significant typos toward the end of the volume, which was surprising - I only mention them because they were so jarring.) Slowly enough that I had to re-read several sections to be sure I was gleaning the author's meaning. In a few spots, passive seems acceptable, yet its constant usage was somewhat jarring.The story is touching and emotional. Bast is an interesting character who deserved his own story, and I look forward to reading more about his tale.The use of artwork is well-done throughout; however, some images were likely unnecessary given the written description. But I do think the additional artwork will hopefully prompt other authors to add art to their works.Suggested reading only if you've read at least Book 1 of Rothfuss's trilogy. If you've read that book, then be prepared for a treat.",

A sensa\u00e7\u00e3o que d\u00e1 \u00e9 que \u00e9 um personagem com mentalidade meio infantil, que age e se preocupa exclusivamente com seus desejos. N\u00e3o \u00e9 um personagem necessariamente ruim, mas t\u00e3o pouco \u00e9 um personagem bom. Ele \u00e9 neutro e guia seus passos a partir de seus desejos. Mas no final, o autor passa a impress\u00e3o de que quer fazer o mundo um lugar melhor e transforma o personagem numa pessoa boazinha. Achei que o autor se perdeu nesse final. Leitura interessante de qualquer forma.",
