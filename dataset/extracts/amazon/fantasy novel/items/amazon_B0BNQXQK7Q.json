It\u2019s a quick read but sure to make you feel a range of emotions during the journey.I found the main characters to be endearing and interesting. You couldn\u2019t help but root for Lucy and Christopher, and then for Hugo and Jack as the storyline progressed.

I loved that Jack Masterson the author of the Clock Island books loved children and was kind to all those that tried to runaway to his island.This books is wholesome and full of fun and mystery.

I devoured this story in a day; I love books about books and this is one of the best. Lucy and Christopher, Hugo and Davey, Jack Masterson and the Mastermind - all truly engaging and wonderful characters. The author also made me wish that the Clock Island books were real because their stories were also so very engaging.

I love a feel good ending but this was feel good, with sweets and ribbons, tied together with honey and bashed over the head with a golden sugar brick. A bit much. I was very glad to get to the end of it, and I struggled.",

                "reviewText": "Loved this from start to finish. Beautifully written and with every turn of the page a fascinating adventure, I think this is my favourite read of the last couple of years.It\u2019s a love story but not between two people although that too plays a part. Rather this is a love affair of ideas, of events shaping people\u2019s lives, of bravery, of elements of fantasy that fit into reality, of reality that has an air of fantasy, of the vulnerability of children and adults and lastly, of friendship.The air of originality in the flow of words and the action itself, is a joy. No spoilers but for me this was a book to be read by a wonderful author who I am hoping has more to come.I repeat, loved every moment.",
