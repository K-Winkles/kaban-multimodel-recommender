I have dreamt of a Christian fantasy and may have found it in this book series.I started reading this, as a 50+ yr old great aunt, to make sure it would be ok for my great niece to read and have ended up loving it myself! The characters are well rounded, the use of spiritual concepts so far are appropriate for youth and I appreciate that the parents and adults are mainly depicted as allies albeit protective. I hope this continues to be a book for young people that portrays parents and adults in harmony and protective authority over the youth in their sphere of influence. Cannot wait to read more. Excellent easy to read, and exciting adventure.So far, this will be on my Christmas list for a number of youth in my circle of friends and family.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars well written",
                "reviewText": "Character-driven teen/preteen story about angels. Christianity is definitely in there, but not pushy, just as the ground of Sheena\u2019s life. Sheena is an interesting person, at once strong for justice and caring about others, while also flawed and human. Her relationships with other kids are also outside the usual mode: she sees the cliques at school very clearly but also feels she shares something with all of them. She has few friends but lots of people she interacts with, and cares a lot for the little boy next door, while also sometimes wishing he\u2019d leave her alone. It\u2019s a more balanced portrayal than most, and her emotions and reactions feel age-appropriate and right for who she is. The author walks a fine line very skillfully. My one con is the book feels a little slow. The mystery is introduced around the halfway point, which is a little late, and Sheena doesn\u2019t really get much further than understanding there are unusual spiritual forces interested in her. I wish we\u2019d gotten a fuller picture than that of what was happening before breaking for book two. I\u2019ll read another one because I enjoy the author\u2019s portrayal of Sheena, and hope that more happens in the next entry.A very small niggle that has nothing much to do with the story:A Vow of Purity ceremony (a promise by a young girl to stay chaste before marriage, made to her dad) is mentioned early on and I thought, as I always do: \u201cWhy don\u2019t evangelical boys take the same Vow of Purity to their moms? Isn\u2019t a boy\u2019s purity expected to be just as much a part of his faith as a girl\u2019s is? And what better way to help remind a boy to respect women than by having him make a vow to his mother?\u201d Doubt it will happen, but I really wish those expectations and promises were more balanced. . .",
