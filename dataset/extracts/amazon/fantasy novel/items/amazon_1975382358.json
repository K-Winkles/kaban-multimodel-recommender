                "reviewText": "It's wonderful that Western fans finally have the novel that connects the original FFVII game with the Advent Children (Complete) film! It might've been a long time coming, but I'm happy to own a copy of this instead of relying on (the wonderfully done) fan translations. This translation felt completely natural (similar to the recent English Ultimania Vol 2, which I also reviewed), but unlike that Ultimania, I happily didn't notice any translation errors in this.I'm an old-school FFVII fan (from '97-98) so I'm only familiar with the western-released Compilation titles, but this novel does a great job of tying in what challenges the cast face before the madness in Advent Children begins. Since this book's a part of the Compilation project, her name's rendered as \"Aerith\" rather than \"Aeris\" (I'm honestly fine with either, since that was a translation error back in the day.)I especially loved the banter between Barret and Cid! And Tifa's feelings (as well as her relationship with Cloud) was incredibly touching to read. You get an honest sense of just how close their family grew before Geostigma seriously affected Denzel and Cloud.",

It's a must have for all FF7 fans, a great collection of novellas set before the events of Advent Children. It also includes beautifully rendered character illustrations in the beginning.

                "reviewText": "Final Fantasy VII On the Way to a Smile is a supplementary novella made up of six interconnected episodes and six short interludes following members of the original FF7 game. In a pleasant prose that takes us quickly through roughly two years of time from the various character perspectives, the short works create a clear picture of a world that has suffered a catastrophe and are now threatened by its aftermath in the form of a growing pandemic and the threatening return of a dangerous adversary. A few new characters add depth to this world allowing the reader to imagine it largely without input from the game which is beneficial for anyone seeking a quick and interesting read. It ends having covered its own story well enough to set up the characters for their appearance in the film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete. There are several very nice still shots of the character renders for that film included at the beginning of the text.Kazushige Nojima has written much of FF VII and its related material, and I have searched for other books he may have written purely because of what I have read here and in the FF VII Remake tie-in book Traces of Two Pasts. This text and the film that follows it are attached to the original game, serving less as an epilogue and more as a well crafted bridge.Four out of five stars, and very much recommended.",

O livro traz muita informa\u00e7\u00e3o interessante, que expande o conhecimento que temos nos jogos.~ Tem uma parte da novel que o Final Fantasy VII Remake faz uma refer\u00eancia:\u201cEnquanto Cloud se lembrar de mim, posso continuar existindo. Dentro do Lifestream e na superf\u00edcie. Mesmo que meu esp\u00edrito se espalhe, mesmo que apenas um fragmento de uma mem\u00f3ria corra pelo planeta, no final posso contar com a consci\u00eancia de Cloud para me trazer de volta. \"- Lifestream Back.No jogo o Sephiroth diz para Cloud:Se o planeta morresse, muitas coisas se perderiam. (...) Aquilo que nos une n\u00e3o seria mais. E eu n\u00e3o gostaria de viver em um mundo assim. \u00c9 por isso que devo lhe pedir este \u00fanico favor. (...) Corra, Cloud ... Corra.

Es ist schade, dass all das nicht im Film erkl\u00e4rt werden konnte aber zur selben Zeit ist es sch\u00f6n geschrieben und man f\u00e4ngt schnell an den Charakter zu m\u00f6gen bzw. seinen Hintergrund zu verstehen und was er f\u00fcr ein paar andere Charaktere wie Tifa und Cloud bedeutet. Die Geschichten zu den anderen Charakteren sind super und es bietet einen Einblick in die postapokalyptische Welt von FF7.",
