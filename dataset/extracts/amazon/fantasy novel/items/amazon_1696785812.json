I ordered the second book when I was 1/3 into this one and yay it comes just as this book has ended.

                "reviewText": "I will be going on a rant with two significant authors. Firstly, Edgar Allan Poe wrote \"Philosophy of Composition.\" He states explicitly that in order for a story to be attention-grabbing, you need to have the main point of the story be in sight of the reader at all times. K. A. Riley never stops talking about \"recruitment\" and \"recruitment day,\" which gave me a real reason to read it, unlike other books that ramble on about events that really don't matter.The story definitely picks up the pace a few chapters in, but I promise you, as a reader who has never really gotten into reading...This is different. There are slight bits of romance here and there, tons of suspense everywhere, adrenaline-pumping action all throughout the story, and lots of character development spread throughout the story. All those things I listed are perfectly divided throughout the story, making for a superior way of story-telling.I will say, though, because the series is a set of 4 trilogies or 12 books in the entire series, this book does end at a climax. It only just started...",

It has same kind of vibe/idea as the divergent series, which nowadays it feels like every book is like another. Characters are various but the main one, Kress, becomes whiney and romantically pathetic a quarter of the way in. All of the seventeen year olds is whisked away on Nov 1 every year to be trained to fight the Eastern Order who they\u2019re currently in war with. During training they find their speciality. K.A. Riley did well with the challenges (a bit of escape room vibe to some) and knows when to end the story/chapter. I just find this series so far to be too unoriginal.

This one starts out with a lot of characters and some really interesting mysteries, and then the entire book is one crazy situation after another. At the end, hang onto ur brain, cuz it\u2019s gonna get blown! There is a pretty good twist! I would say it\u2019s predictable - but only in that you know there\u2019s gotta be something \u201chinky\u201d going on - but it\u2019s not something you\u2019re gonna see coming! She definitely foreshadows the twist, but I was pleasantly surprised by what it ends up being!! K A Riley has a dang good start here, and I am ITCHING to get to the second book!! Well written characters, an incredibly thought-out plot line with amazing potential to be a hang-on-to-your-shorts type of series reminiscent of The Hunger Games and the Divergent series, but with a fresh coat of paint!!",

It had good depth, showing how every person in the \"family\" contributed, from Manthy's supernatural tech powers, to Card's fierce loyalty. K. A. made the story fast paced and filled with twists every now and then, with a small bit of romance between Brohn and Kress. The characters suffered many losses, SPOILER ALERT, but the one that hit me most was the loss of Karmine because I thought he and Kella would well end up together. I really liked how even though they were all different from each other, they stood up and never gave the blame to someone else, instead taking the blame together, which I really liked in how they were a \"family\".

I liked the writing, the flow overall, it\u2019s an easy to follow read.",
