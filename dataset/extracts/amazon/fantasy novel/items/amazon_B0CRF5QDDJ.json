                "reviewText": "I genuinely think the author hit a wall after the Klausner Domain arc ended. Now that Sei is recognized as the Saint in the Kingdom and she has full control over her saint powers, there's nothing more for the story to tell. Good stories need conflict and this story has none. Now that monsters aren't a threat anymore the author doesn't seem to know what to do. There's the illusion of a \"conflict\" in this light novel where Sei has to hide her Saint powers from a foreign prince while helping him, but we're not provided any reasonable justification for why that's necessary. Who cares if the foreign prince knows Sei is the Saint? There's zero tension or stakes involved. Even when after 2/3rds of the way in the story we get some actual stakes with a progressive disease, it's for a character we do not meet nor spend any time with.And once again we have what little might have made for compelling storytelling being relegated to the \"behind the scenes\" section of the light novel where any potential drama is wrapped up without Sei knowing about it. Only this time it's even worse because the behind the scenes chapter in this light novel is for an event in the previous light novel. Making readers have to jump to that story if they want to follow the series of events in chronological order.The one area of the story that could see tangible forward progression, Sei's love life with Albert, again goes absolutely nowhere.Skip this light novel. Like the one before it, it feels completely like a side story that does nothing to further the overall narrative. If there even is an \"overall narrative\" at this point. The story seems to have logically concluded with Sei being recognized as the Saint.",
