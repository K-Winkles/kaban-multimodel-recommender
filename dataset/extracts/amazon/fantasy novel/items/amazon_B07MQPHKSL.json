Books in books in secret underground libraries with endless levels and passages and a sea. A starless sea.This was lyrical! Even though I cannot fully tell you what this story was about I could connect with our main character Zachary. There was a sense of belonging,\u2026or not, in the story and it\u2019s definitely a book I\u2019d like to reread one day.

                "reviewText": "Overall: I have very mixed thoughts on this book. I felt completely absorbed in it and absolutely loved the writing. The author writes like a painting, everything is so descriptive and lyrical it is hard to not be enthralled. That being said, I wanted more plot and more character depth and found both to be lacking. Still, an enjoyable read but would give this a 3.5/5 or a 6.5/10 overall.Summary:\u201cA boy at the beginning of a story has no way of knowing that the story has begun.\u201dZachary Ezra Rollins is a fortune-teller's son, gay, a bibliophile and lover of cocktails, and a graduate student studying video games when he comes across a book called Sweet Sorrows. The book includes a passage intimately describing a moment from his actual childhood that Zachary becomes obsessed with it and reads it compulsively. He becomes obsessed with the need to reach the Starless Sea, a mysterious otherworld that he failed to enter as a child when he turned away from a painted door. The story follows Zachary\u2019s adventures of getting to and once he is in the Starless Sea.The Good:\u201cIt doesn't look like anything special, like it contains an entire world, though the same could be said of any book.\u201dThe writing in this book is exquisite. The different fairytales and fables that intersperse the novel are lovely and this book really lives up to the power of storytelling. I felt completely engrossed in the writing and found myself rereading sections just to experience the beautiful writing again. This book succeeds in capturing you, transporting you to another world, and holding you in. I also loved the mystery and how most things come together by the end. For all those reasons, I loved it.The Bad: Very fragmented and disjointed throughout the whole book. I think the author may have tried a bit too hard to make this unique and I felt it suffered as a result. There are a dozen or so narratives all interspersed into one book and every chapter is different so you never know where it may lead. My other major issue with this book were the characters, and Zachary especially. Zachary Ezra Rawlins (and his entire name is used in the beginning of every chapter about him just in case we forget who he is\u2026 which you can\u2019t!) is the star of \u201cThe Starless Sea\u201d but only because he is fated to be. I did not feel that I grew to know or love him, and was surprised by this given the amazing writing. I did not feel connected to Zachary or really any other character and this may have been a result of too many narratives competing with one another.Favorite Quotes:\u201cStrange, isn\u2019t it? To love a book. When the words on the pages become so precious that they feel like part of your own history because they are. It\u2019s nice to finally have someone read stories I know so intimately.\u201d\u201cEveryone is a part of a story, what they want is to be part of something worth recording\u201d\u201cNot all stories speak to all listeners, but all listeners can find a story that does, somewhere, sometime. In one form or another.\u201dEveryone wants the stars. Everyone wishes to grasp that which exists out of reach. To hold the extraordinary in their hands and keep the remarkable in their pockets.\u201d\u201cWe are all stardust and stories.\u201d\u201cBe brave,\u201d she says. \u201cBe bold. Be loud. Never change for anyone but yourself. Any soul worth their star-stuff will take the whole package as is and however it grows. Don\u2019t waste your time on anyone who doesn\u2019t believe you when you tell them how you feel.\u201d\u201cBut the world is strange and endings are not truly endings no matter how the stars might wish it so.\u201d\u201cThis is not where our story ends, he writes. This is only where it changes.\u201d",

                "reviewText": "Que miss\u00e3o escrever uma resenha para este livro. Para come\u00e7ar, Erin Morgenstern escreveu um livro de fantasia e mist\u00e9rio diferente de qualquer outro que j\u00e1 li. Sua narrativa \u00e9 contemplativa. Me parece que ela colocou em p\u00e1ginas tudo que j\u00e1 quis escrever na vida, ent\u00e3o as lias e admirava.The Starless Sea conta a hist\u00f3ria de Zachary, um jovem rapaz que encontra na biblioteca da faculdade um livro que conta sua pr\u00f3pria hist\u00f3ria. Ele descreve n\u00e3o apenas seu presente, como seu passado e algum futuro. Zachary entra em uma jornada muito louca (pe\u00e7o desculpas pelo termo, mas \u00e9 o mais perto da realidade que posso chegar) envolvendo organiza\u00e7\u00f5es secretas e ambientes fant\u00e1sticos, incluindo o misterioso Mar Sem Estrelas.\u201cAlgu\u00e9m estava tentando impedir a hist\u00f3ria de terminar, eu acho. Mas a hist\u00f3ria queria um final.\u201dToda narrativa \u00e9 embasada por mist\u00e9rios. Quando temos respostas, elas nunca s\u00e3o evidentes, sendo ditas por met\u00e1foras, por exemplo. Zachary caminha \u00e0 procura de sentido, em um universo de diversas hist\u00f3rias que se intercalam por trajet\u00f3rias e personagens. Pode ser confuso? Sim! Mas n\u00e3o deixa de ser incr\u00edvel!H\u00e1 contos, p\u00e1ginas de di\u00e1rios, f\u00e1bulas, hist\u00f3rias que explicam o universo, hist\u00f3rias anteriores de outros personagens, e at\u00e9 hist\u00f3rias que ficam dif\u00edceis at\u00e9 achar conex\u00e3o com Zachary diretamente. Quem ama a escrita, narrativa e leituras desafiadoras pensa: Meu Deus, Erin Morgenstern \u00e9 um g\u00eanio! FATO!\u201cNem todas as hist\u00f3rias falam com todos os leitores, mas todos os leitores encontram hist\u00f3rias que falam com eles de algum jeito e em algum momento.\u201dSe voc\u00ea gosta de narrativas que te indicam \u201csegura na minha m\u00e3o e s\u00f3 confia\u201d, voc\u00ea vai amar O Mar Sem Estrelas. Se n\u00e3o, talvez este n\u00e3o seja o livro ideal neste momento. Ou talvez, este seja s\u00f3 o in\u00edcio de sua hist\u00f3ria, mas voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 abrir uma porta para entrar e descobrir.\u201cUm menino no in\u00edcio de sua hist\u00f3ria nunca sabe que sua hist\u00f3ria est\u00e1 come\u00e7ando\u201dMesmo o foco sendo nos eventos e nos universos criados, O Mar sem Estrelas tem uma linda representa\u00e7\u00e3o LGBT e de personagens n\u00e3o brancos. Eu li a vers\u00e3o em ingl\u00eas, mas a Editora Morro Branco est\u00e1 lan\u00e7ando agora a edi\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira!",
