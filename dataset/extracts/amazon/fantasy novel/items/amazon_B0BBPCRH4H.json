Most of this could have been just a paragraph not a fifth of the book (according to my Kindle). For the rest, well Fuuga persuades Souma to attack the demon realm. This is the first time Fuuga's managed to manipulate Souma in this way.The two sides attack but receive some surprises. When this is resolved there's a whole lot of exposition about how and why. A lot of exposition. It's interesting for a while then gets repetitive.This book could have been a lot better but it ended up being a waste of time. The problem is I'm not sure you can skip it. It all depends upon how the next one starts. I didn't like this and if you're into the great characters and plot building of this series, you probably won't either.",

                "reviewText": "It is finally time for Souma's confrontation with the Demon Lord and its forces. The problem is that it is on Haan's conditions, not Souma's own, something Souma is sure leads to trouble. First though, there are marriages to perform.Much like previous volumes, I enjoy the slice-of-life parts at the start, although 25% of the book is a long bit for a marriage or two. The reveals should not come as a surprise and were ok. Much like earlier books the author also has a tendency to over explain, for example there is no need for 2 pages of text to tell person X is send to Y for research. Enjoyable characters, and for the most part a read much like previous volumes.There are two reasons though for me to give it 3 stars. There was a bit of a deus-ex-machina situation going on in the middle, both the start and resolution to a specific conflict. It made the whole thing feel like a needless chapter just added for adding a fight and making Souma feel needlessly guilty about soldiers dying under his command.The second is something I have been grumbling for some time about. I just don't like the addition of Kublai Kahn, aka Haan and for me this volume just made it worse. It makes me feel the man was added just for there to be a conflict that could only be resolved through violence. People who have no or less issues with that addition probably feel better about this volume.Still, I did enjoy the book despite the big eyeroll moment in the middle. I just hope the conflict with Haan is resolved satisfactory, even though I have no idea what I am hoping for.",
