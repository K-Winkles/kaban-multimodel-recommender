                "reviewText": "Actual rating is 4.5 stars.I got an E-ARC copy of this amazing story in exchange for an honest review by JLA, so I'm about to get real with you!It should come as no surprise to all of you that once again, queen JLA is releasing another book series and she killed it!I mean it's hard for me to describe to you how good it was, because it's like I've said this at least 20 times with Armentrout's books, they are great. There is nothing less to it, every story she puts out, it's just amazing (to me anyway.)A Shadow in the Ember is no exception.You might be questioning my rating if literally paragraphs ago I said it's an amazing book, and it is, but there were a couple of things I felt a bit repetitive.Sera and Nyktos remind me of a couple Armentrout already introduced us to. They are amazing on their own way, but at the beginning it felt like rereading one of her other books. Though it quickly changed, it still made the first like 20 percent of the book drag on a little bit.But I think the reason why it was a little bit slower to begin with is because of what was to come.I cannot explain to you how good this story is without giving you major spoilers, but I will try.Seraphena is a Maiden. She was promised to the Primal of Death as his consort. She has been trained, but not in the way you might think. She was trained to bring the Primal of Death to his knees. She is expected to end him. To use love as a way to end him and end with a century's old debt.Sera is ready for this task, but somehow she fails miserably, why you ask? Because the Primal of Death has no need or want for a consort. So it's her fault (not really, but that is what she believes,) everyone and their grandmother blames her for it. So now she is trying to fix it somehow, she has no idea how, but she is looking for a solution.She is a trained assassin, she can kill you in less time that you'd have to blink, so maybe that will help... if it doesn't get her in trouble first (spoiler alert, it does).This story is all about Sera, about her journey to accept what she really is and what she is worth. There is a silver-eye-god that's gonna be there and they will have a fun time learning all about her and what she is capable of doing.There is so much that happens in the first installment of this series that if I tried to describe everything about the book, this post would be infinite, so I'll just summarize a little bit some of my favorite parts.There is death, that is something you should expect a lot of, but also some of it it's not in the way you might be thinking of.A silver-eyed god.Banter.Ash.Exciting lake scene.Ash.Power, her gift is just\u2026 *chef\u2019s kiss* but at the same time, could be dangerous.Banter.Asher.Sexy banter.Nyktos, ruler of the Shadowlands.Amazing entrances.Nyktos.Blood. Lots and lots of blood.Lives (that will make sense eventually).That ending. Oh gosh, I mean I was kind of preparing myself for that, I kind of had a feeling, but it was still pretty epic.But most of all, NYKTOS.I mean, you guys just got to read this story, it\u2019s amazing, I think you will really enjoy it and it will bring a lot of joy to your life.",

                "reviewText": "The first book in the series Flesh and Fire introduces Seraphena to a young woman who was created with only one purpose, to seduce Nyktos and kill him so that her kingdom can be saved. What I like about Jennifer's books is that she's in no rush to get the story started. I love big books, but I can't deny that while I was reading, I wondered if all that at the beginning of the book was necessary, but then it became clear that it was, I came to understand along the way that some plots were appearing that if she hadn't shown all the precarious reality of that realm, maybe we couldn't understand the true weight of Sera's actions as well as everything she discovers later. Sera reminded me a lot of Poppy, although I think the first one was even crazier and will definitely get more development, I already love her as well as Poppy. Nyktos is wonderful, a lot of people are saying that they prefer him to Casteel, but I honestly came to love them both on the same level (if that's possible). Like Poppy and Casteel, the couple in this book don't resolve their differences in the first book, there's a lot of DR out there, but I know that with the plot we were shown at the end of the story, this could end up resolving faster than looks. I think that's what I like best about this author, she's in no hurry to solve everything in one book, I think that's why she's the queen of the cliffhangers. I think of the authors I read And I'm a fan, Jennifer is one of the most creative when we talk about a plot twist, and not just one, her books are crammed with smaller plots and at the end of the book you practice freaked out with so much revelation. In addition to revealing a lot about their history, we came to understand more about Poppy's powers that I almost had a heart attack reading. I hope the second book doesn't take long to come out. Because you can't finish a book like that and make us wait another year to know the result. Looking forward to The war of the two queens.",

                "reviewText": "Once again, I am at lost as how to start my review and this is often the case when it comes to Jennifer L. Armentrout\u2019s books. I\u2019m going to try and make this review as spoiler free as possible.I knew that I was going to love this new series from the Blood and Ash world, but I wasn\u2019t expecting to be as enthralled as I was with the Blood and Ash series.A lot happens throughout this book and even if sometimes it doesn\u2019t seem like a lot is happening, you still can\u2019t put the book down knowing just how unpredictable Sera\u2019s mind can go and you never know what she will do next (when you wish you didn't need to work, sleep, eat or that you always had energy to read).Which brings me to the two main characters\u2026Once again, Jen has cooked up characters that are so interesting and entertaining. She always has some awesome sassy heroines and Sera isn\u2019t the exception. I loved how she isn\u2019t afraid to speak her mind even if it can get her in trouble; more often than not. She also has such a beautiful heart even if sometimes she tends to forget that. Often, she finds herself questioning everything and that reminded me so much of another book character *cough* Poppy *cough*.The Primal of Death is\u2026 Wow\u2026 He\u2019s honestly such an intense character. I always felt like even if he will protect at all costs the people that he cares about, he has a lot of trouble demonstrating what he\u2019s feeling probably due to everything that has happened to him and because of what he is. But he was such an interesting character to discover throughout this book and I cannot wait for the next book and see more of him.But Sera and him together were such an amazing duo. Honestly, their chemistry was off the chart bringing any arguments between them to another level. But like for a lot of characters Jen has written, she has a way to find characters that will both bring the best and the worse out of each other but who also fit so perfectly together somehow.A lot of characters come and go in this book and so many of them you will love, and others will leave you with the envy of slapping them across the face (I\u2019m actually just being nice because let\u2019s be real, I would have done more sometimes).Overall, this was such an amazing book and even if the ending leaves your mind blown and in need to have the next book in your hands; you can\u2019t resist the pull of this book. I honestly loved it from the beginning to the end and there are so many things I can\u2019t wait to discover along the characters and see where their journey will continue next.Also be prepared to go through an eruption of feels with this book as you are more than likely to invest yourself in these characters and what they are going through. You will be pulled from one to another to another and back to the first feel before you know it.",
