                "reviewText": "So maybe you think after the volumes before this that, \"things are kind of stagnant right?\" I mean sure they are getting stronger and finding their way, not to mention that all the details of their daily lives are maybe more lost here than the first volume for example which even featured scenes of them just looking for food to eat and thinking about how to spend their money. I enjoyed that quite a bit and maybe to much but now it has gotten to the point where the main focus if the novel is action over daily life. I don't mind it per se but the thing that made this novel series so unique to begin with was the attention to detail of daily life. This book is of course mostly senseless monologue and ridiculous dialogue which can get old after a while but the plot keeps me going as of now.",

                "reviewText": "I liked this book as it shows I enjoyed this volume of Grimgar as it does something that you didn't get until volume 3, and that was interaction with another group. While ranta has been quite an annoying character in all of the volumes he is a little less obnoxious in this volume (don't worry, there will always be a character thats hated). If i had to give character development it would go to Haru and his party as a whole, as in this volume we see the difference between two different styles of leaders and parties, and how much risk/reward comes with each type. Somehow Ao manages to make the feel of tension slower in this volume compared to the end of volume 4 this is partly due to the party's growth. The author took an interesting twist on what was discovered, and the trials needed to get through this adventure. The weakest part of the book was the very end. For me to go any further in depth will cause me to talk about spoilers, so if you were wondering i liked this book more than volume 4, and it comes second to volume 3 (volume 3 was a beast).",
