Andrzej Sapkowski's storytelling is masterful, weaving intricate plots and rich character development. Geralt of Rivia, the central character, is a fascinating protagonist with a complex moral compass.The series offers a refreshing take on traditional fantasy tropes, exploring the shades of gray in morality rather than a clear-cut divide between good and evil. Sapkowski's writing style is engaging, providing a perfect balance between action, political intrigue, and moments of profound reflection.While the books can be challenging at times due to multiple timelines and intricate world-building, the payoff is immensely rewarding for those who invest in the narrative. Overall, The Witcher series is a must-read for fantasy enthusiasts, offering a mature and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition within a brilliantly crafted fantasy realm.",

I bought it at a discount for about $44 dollars plus tax so it was worth it for that price. If I\u2019m being honest I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the base price of $80 dollars but that\u2019s my own opinion. For the story itself im still on book one (saga 1) but it\u2019s pretty interesting and intriguing for reading it for the first time. The only problem for me when im reading it is that the words and phrases are a little hard to understand for me. But that\u2019s just my own problem. Im sure most other people can understand the story just fine. In conclusion, I\u2019ll give The Witcher box set a 4 star since it\u2019s not perfect buts it\u2019s definitely better than I thought before buying. Thank you for reading this review.",
