                "reviewText": "This was a great adventure/mystery/historical fantasy with a dash of horror and romance. I liked Petra's strength and resolve in doing what's right and following the path fate had put her on. We often try so hard to fight the inevitable. She shows us that putting your strength into pushing forward instead of pulling back can make all the difference. I want to know more about Joseph and I hope we'll get to know him and the other survivors more in the next books.I liked the Jinni and wish I could have had more time to get to know him and Frau Konig and their stories. There were so many elements that were interesting and different than other stories I've read, but seemed to fit well into the WWI-esque war scene.I will admit I was a little glad when a couple of the people died so it wasn't so hard to keep track of who was who. There are a LOT of men with names I'm not used to and it makes it hard to keep everyone separate.",

                "reviewText": "Good Read.There was creative ways magic was being used, along with how its users were perceived in the world. The undead weren\u2019t the typical kind which was refreshing. The book also had an overall eastern European style to it make it feel unique and different from other stories. This was the first book I have read in a while that left me wanting more.ReviewThe book does a great job of creating a world where its known people are able to use magic. Also, certain magic abilities have a lore among the average person and magic users. The book explores what life would be like for a magic user during a world war.All of the characters work well in the book allowing for conflict, love, and laughter to be easier brought out during their interaction with each other. The fact that people who can through fireballs can still get scared or struggle with spells during stressful time made it easy to worry for them during challenging times. However, the are many characters but yet they were all easily remember because they were all unique enough to stand out.The story is well paced and provided plenty of high and low moments. There are a few twists that keeps the reader on their toes while adding just a hint of romance that makes the reader wonder. The plot had many layers that did a good job building off each other.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve read the Vine Witch Trilogy and was interested in Luanne Smith\u2019s new series, A Witch\u2019s Lens. It was slow to start and I would say that the story became interesting in the final 7-8 chapters. It\u2019s set in wartime Russia and a secret organization has recruited a small group of witches in an attempt to stop a growing band of fallen soldiers who have been turned into \u201cup\u00edri\u201d or zombies. The characters, other than Petra, were not very well developed and any of them could have been killed off at any given moment without leaving a void in the story. I\u2019m glad I stuck with it and finished this first in the series, but won\u2019t bother reading the rest. As always, this is only one person\u2019s opinion and another reader may love it.",

                "reviewText": "Petra Kurkov\u00e1 has an unusual ability. Through her camera\u2019s lens, she can capture images of souls on film, identifying presences that would not otherwise be seen. That was all I needed to know about The Witch\u2019s Lens to convince me to read this book.Petra was born a witch and her unique talent attracts the attention of a man recruiting for the battle at the front. Josef Svoboda forms a team of sorcerers to be combatants in a secret society that is fighting a paranormal war that rages alongside the mundane conflict.Petra\u2019s husband left for the war long ago and she does not even know if he is alive or dead. So, with nothing to keep her at home, Petra joins the team. At first the team doesn\u2019t really know what they can do. But the dangers of the human war combined with the supernatural attacks inspire the team to action. As the story unfolds, the reader learns more about the talents of the team and of Petra, who is more than a mere photographer. I appreciated that there was no information dump of the team and the secret society. The readers will learn what is important \u2013 when it is important.Petra and Josef are drawn to each other, and while there may be a hint of romance, the focus is pretty much on Petra. Several paranormal players will be added to the story, adding complexity, intrigue, and danger for Petra and her team. This convergence of paranormal players leads to many heroic actions for the team and also provides fodder for future plots in this new series.The more I got into the story, the more imperative it became for me to finish the book. The story never dulls, and even though it takes place during war, it is not without some happier moments and hope. One of the nice things about this book is the price \u2013 $4.99. If you think the combination of history and the paranormal sounds intriguing, I recommend The Witch\u2019s Lens.",

They also became decent friends I like the way the book ended. I will definitely read the next book in this series.",

The suspense is very real and the descriptions so beautiful, turns of phrase that are art themselves. I like this author so much and am always looking forward to her next book. I also have to say that her alluding to characters from previous books is very satisfying as it creates a whole world of people and places that give us an anchor, maybe a map, in this place and time that she has created. Not necessary but fun.My favorite open of any book or all time, is still The Vine Witch",
