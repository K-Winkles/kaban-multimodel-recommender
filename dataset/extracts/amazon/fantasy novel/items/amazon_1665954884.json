            "Editorial Reviews Review \"Lauren Roberts's exciting story thrills with flirtatious banter, cutthroat battles, and searing betrayals...present[ing] a spin on the deadly game trope by incorporating multiple layers of complexity: dual POVs; fathers both admirable and problematic; hints of a love triangle between Pae and two brothers; sexually tense moments with 'a promise of passion'; fierce training and fight sequences enhanced by creative abilities; and an underground Resistance hungry for revenge. Powerless is a compelling tale of darkness and destruction, of a divide carved by a vicious king, and of the lure of freedom, choice, and power.\" -- Shelf Awareness\"As the Trials become increasingly deadly, Paedyn and Kai must reconcile their burgeoning romantic feelings for each other with their respective places in a brutal and discriminatory society...Paedyn and Kai\u2019s alternating POVs skillfully juxtapose steamy romantic encounters with heart-pounding action and gory violence, delivering a tale of political and personal intrigue that capably kicks off an epic trilogy.\" -- Publishers Weekly About the Author When Lauren Roberts isn\u2019t writing about fantasy worlds and bantering love interests, she can likely be found burrowed in bed reading about them.

Chapter 1: Paedyn CHAPTER 1 Paedyn Thick, hot liquid runs down my arm. Blood. Funny, I don\u2019t remember the guard nicking me with his sword before my fist connected with his face. Despite being a Flash, he apparently couldn\u2019t manage to move faster than my right hook to his jaw. The smell of soot stings my nose, forcing me to clamp a grimy hand over it to stop a sneeze from slipping out. That would be a very pathetic way to get caught. When I\u2019m sure that my nose won\u2019t alert the Imperials lurking beneath where I\u2019m hiding, I return my hand to the filthy wall my back is currently pressed against with my feet planted opposite me. After taking a deep breath that nearly has me choking on soot, I slowly begin my climb upward once again. With thighs burning almost as much as my nose, I force my body to continue shimmying while stifling the sneeze. Climbing up a chimney isn\u2019t exactly how I thought I would be spending my evening. The small space has me sweating, swallowing my fear before scrambling to the top of the cramped corridor, eager to replace grime-caked walls with a starry night. When my head finally peeks over the top, I greedily gulp down the sticky air, then climb up and over, immediately bombarded with a new concoction of smells far more unpleasant than the stench of soot clinging to my body, my clothes, my hair. Sweat, fish, spices, and I\u2019m quite certain some sort of bodily fluid, blends to create the aroma that surrounds Loot Alley. Balancing atop the chimney, I strain my eyes on the shadowed roof to inspect my sticky arm. I\u2019d nearly forgotten to examine it without the usual biting pain that accompanies a sword slash to remind me. I rip off a strip of cloth from the sweaty tank that clings to my body, dabbing at the gash with it. Adena\u2019s going to kill me for ruining her stitching. Again. I\u2019m surprised when I don\u2019t feel the familiar twinge of pain as I rub at my arm with the rough fabric, impatiently sopping up the stickiness. And that\u2019s when I smell it. Honey. The same honey that belongs to the sticky buns oozing out of the many pockets in my ragged vest and dripping down my arm\u2014mistaken for blood. I sigh, rolling my eyes at myself. It\u2019s a welcome surprise, nonetheless. Even honey soaking my clothes beats trying to wash blood out. I take in a deep breath and look out over the crumbling, run-down buildings cast in shadows by the flickering lampposts dotting the street. There\u2019s not much electricity here in the slums, but the king generously spared us a few lampposts. Thanks to the Volts and Scholars using their abilities to create a sustained power grid, I have to work exceptionally hard to stay in the shadows. Farther from the slums, the more the rows of shops and homes slowly improve in condition and size. Shacks turn into homes, homes turn into mansions, leading up to the most daunting building of all. Squinting through the darkness, I can just barely make out the looming towers of the royal castle and the sloping dome of the Bowl Arena that resides beside it. My eyes flick back to the wide street stretched out before me, scanning the surrounding sketchy buildings. Loot Alley is the very heart of the slums, pumping crime and trade throughout the city. I trace the dozens of other alleys and streets jutting off from it, getting lost in the maze that is the city before offering a sigh and small smile to the familiar street beneath me. Home. Sort of. Technically, a home implies that one has a roof over their head. But stars are far more fun to stare at than a ceiling. I would know, seeing that I used to have a ceiling to stare at every night, back when I had no need for the stars to keep me company. My traitorous gaze sweeps across the city to where I know my former home lies wedged between Merchant and Elm Streets. Where a happy little family is likely sitting around the dinner table, laughing and discussing their day with one another\u2014 I hear a thump, followed by the murmuring of voices that drag me from my bitter thoughts. Straining to hear, I can just make out the muffled, deep voice that belongs to the guard I so kindly relieved of his duties a short while ago. \u201c\u2014came up right behind me, quiet as a mouse, and then\u2026 then the next thing I know, I get a tap on the shoulder and a fist to the face.\u201d A very irritated and very shrill female voice echoes up the chimney. \u201cYou\u2019re a Flash, for Plague\u2019s sake\u2014aren\u2019t you supposed to be fast or something?\u201d She takes a deep breath. \u201cDid you at least get a look at his face before you let him rob me? Again?\u201d \u201cAll I saw were his eyes,\u201d the guard mumbles. \u201cBlue. Very blue.\u201d The woman huffs in irritation. \u201cHow helpful. Let me just stop every person on Loot to see if their eyes match your vivid description of very blue.\u201d I stifle my snort as something creaks from the other end of the room, followed by a chorus of muffled footsteps. From the groan of rotting wood shifting beneath several new pairs of boots, I immediately deduce that three more guards have joined the hunt. And that\u2019s my cue. I hop off the chimney and grab onto the raised ledge of the roof, swinging my legs over the side to dangle above the street. Blowing out a breath, I let go and bite my tongue against a yelp as gravity yanks me toward the ground. With a soft thud I drop ungracefully into a merchant\u2019s wagon brimming with hay. The stiff straw pokes through my clothes like one of Adena\u2019s pincushions, and a cloud of soot and hay rises on the night breeze when I jump out onto the street. Passing the time by plucking straw from my tangled hair, I begin my journey back to the Fort, weaving through beat-up merchant carts, all abandoned for the night, feet dancing over trash and broken trinkets. Looters slumped against alleys or tucked in between buildings whisper among themselves as I pass. I feel the weight of the dagger tucked into my boot and relax at the comfort of the cool steel as I pass groups of fellow homeless huddling together for the night. I can see the faint shimmer of purple force fields shielding some, while others don\u2019t even have an ability strong enough to allow them to sleep peacefully, which is the exact reason they call the slums their home. I keep my steps swift and sure as my eyes sweep back and forth across the alleys, never letting my guard down. The poor don\u2019t discriminate. A shilling is a shilling, and they don\u2019t care if they jump someone worse off than them to get it. Several guards cross my path as I zigzag down streets, forcing me to slow down to steer clear of them. Every shop, corner, and street has been bestowed the gift of leering, white-uniformed law enforcers. These brutal Imperials have been stationed everywhere along Loot Alley by decree of the king due to an increase in crime. Clearly has nothing to do with me. I slip down a smaller alley, making my way toward the dead end. There, tucked in the corner, is a mangled barricade of broken merchant carts, cardboard, old sheets, and Plague knows what else. Before I\u2019m even halfway to the pile of garbage we call home, a face obscured by wild shoulder-length curls pops up over the Fort. \u201cDid you get it!?\u201d Untangling her long legs from where she sits, she effortlessly stands and phases right through the three-foot wall of our trash barricade without a second thought, and then she\u2019s bounding toward me with so much hope in her eyes that you\u2019d think I\u2019ve offered her a real roof over her head and a warm meal. And though I can give her neither of those things, I do have something far better, in her opinion. I sigh. \u201cI\u2019m offended you doubted me, Adena. I thought you\u2019d have a little more faith in my abilities after all these years.\u201d I sling my pack from my back and pull out the crumpled red silk from within, unable to suppress my smile as a look of awe settles on her face. She greedily claws the silk from my hands, running her fingers through the soft folds of the fabric. Peeking up through the curly bangs hanging in her hazel eyes, she looks at me as though I\u2019ve just single-handedly eradicated the Plague rather than stolen fabric from a woman not much better off than we are. Like I\u2019m the hero and not the villain. Adena\u2019s smile could rival the sun over the Scorches Desert. \u201cPae, you and your sticky fingers work magic, you know that?\u201d She throws her arms around my neck, pulling me into a crushing embrace that causes more honey to ooze down my vest and pool in my pockets. \u201cSpeaking of sticky fingers\u2026\u201d I peel myself from her hug to fish around in my pockets. I retrieve six smashed sticky buns, only slightly unappetizing with the hay now decorating them. Adena\u2019s eyes go wide at the sight before snatching one from my hand just as greedily as she did the fabric. She turns midbite and uses her Phaser ability to stride right back through our fort without a second thought, plopping herself down on the colorless, rough rugs that lie on the inside of the barricade. She pats the spot beside her expectantly, and unlike her, I ungracefully leap over the wall before I can take a seat. \u201cI bet Maria wasn\u2019t too happy about her shop being looted. Again. Poor thing should really up her security,\u201d Adena says between bites, a crooked smile joining the crumbs on her face. Despite my robbing the woman at least once a month for the past several years, she\u2019s still only managed to conclude that I am a he. At least she\u2019s trying. \u201cActually,\u201d I say with a shrug, \u201cshe had two more Imperials stationed around her shop than normal. She must be getting tired of all the stolen sticky buns over the years.\u201d Adena narrows her hazel eyes at the sight of my smile. \u201cThank the Plague you didn\u2019t get caught, Pae.\u201d As soon as the familiar phrase slips past her lips, my jaw sets instinctively while hers falls open midbite. She visibly cringes, her brow crinkling and throat clearing. \u201cSorry. Bad habit.\u201d My fingers drift to the thick ring on my thumb, spinning it mindlessly while I muster a weak smile. This topic is one we typically try to avoid, though it\u2019s my fault the subject became suddenly awkward to speak of in the first place. All due to a moment of weakness that I wish I wasn\u2019t so relieved about. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not the words that bother me, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the meaning behind them,\u201d she cuts in with a smile and a shockingly accurate imitation of my voice. I nearly choke on my laugh and a piece of sweet dough. \u201cAre you quoting me, A?\u201d By way of answering, she takes a bite of sticky bun before declaring between mouthfuls, \u201cAnd it\u2019s not the Plague that makes you sick. It\u2019s what came after.\u201d I nod slowly while absentmindedly tracing the rug\u2019s worn pattern beneath us, the feeling familiar beneath my finger. The idea of thanking the Plague that killed thousands of Ilyans makes me lose my appetite for even sticky buns. Thanking the thing that caused so much pain and death and discrimination. But all anyone cares about now is who the Plague didn\u2019t kill. The kingdom was isolated for years to keep the sickness from spreading to the surrounding cities, and only the strongest in Ilya survived the disease that altered the very structure of humans. The fast became exceptionally faster, the strong became unbeatable, and those who lurked in the shadows could become the shadows. Dozens of supernatural abilities were bestowed upon Ilyans alone, all varying in strength, purpose, and power. Gifts given as a reward for surviving. They are Elite. They are extraordinary. They are exceptional. \u201cJust\u2026\u201d Adena trails off, poking at her sticky bun while struggling to form words for once. \u201cJust be careful, Pae. If you get caught and aren\u2019t able to talk yourself out of it\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I state far too casually, ignoring the worry that washes over me. \u201cThis is what I do, A. What I\u2019ve always done.\u201d She sighs through her smile, waving a dismissive hand. \u201cI know, I know. You can handle yourself with the Elites.\u201d I feel that rush of relief once again, making me feel both guilty and grateful that she truly knows me. Because not all those who survived the Plague were fortunate enough to be gifted with abilities. No, the Ordinaries were just that\u2014ordinary. And over the next several decades following the Plague, the Ordinaries and Elites lived in peace. Until King Edric decreed that Ordinaries were no longer fit to live in his kingdom. It was over three decades ago when sickness swept through the land. Due to the outbreak of what was likely a common illness, the king\u2019s Healers used the opportunity to claim that Ordinaries were carrying an undetectable disease, saying it was likely the reason they hadn\u2019t developed abilities. Extended exposure to them became harmful to both Elites and their powers, and over time, the Ordinaries were dwindling the abilities Elites are so protective of. I fight the urge to roll my eyes at the thought. My father believed that was bullshit, and I think no differently. But even if I had proof of the king lying through his teeth, it\u2019s not as though a girl from the slums is in any position to be believed. But the king couldn\u2019t allow his Elite society to be weakened, or worse, by mere Ordinaries. Extinction was not an option for the extraordinary. And so began the Purging. Even now, decades later, tales of the bodies that scattered the sand under the scalding sun are casually passed around campfires, scary stories whispered among children. Sticky fingers close over mine, the honey coating Adena\u2019s hands as sweet as the spreading smile she shares with me. My secret is stowed in the glint of her eyes, in the loyalty lining her expression. I\u2019ve spent so much of my life resigned to the fact that nothing would ever be real. Every friendship false, every kindness calculated. \u201cHide your feelings, hide your fear, and most importantly, hide behind your facade. No one can know, Paedy. Trust no one and nothing but your instincts.\u201d My father\u2019s gentle voice is oddly jarring as it echoes in my head, reminding me that every part of my life should be a lie and the girl sitting before me should be as deceived as the rest of the kingdom. Selfishness only stole my sanity for a single night, but that was all it took for me to endanger the both of us. \u201cAll right, enough talk of the Plague,\u201d Adena says cheerily, scanning the alley before adding, \u201cand your\u2026 situation.\u201d I don\u2019t bother stifling my snort. \u201cIt seems that two years haven\u2019t been enough time for you to practice subtlety, A.\u201d I doubt she even heard me. Doubt she can focus on anything other than the fabric now gliding between her fingers. With hazel eyes scanning over sewing supplies, Adena abandons our previous conversation to ramble about what pieces she\u2019ll be making with the new silk. Her warm brown hands dig through scraps of fabric in the flickering lamplight, beginning to fold edges, pin corners, prick fingers, curse relentlessly. We fall into the type of easy conversation that only comes after spending years surviving on the streets together, making it easy to interpret Adena\u2019s garbled words around the pins pressed between her lips. I roll over, finally falling quiet as I watch her steady fingers and furrowed brow, too engrossed with her work to sleep. A stabbing pain in my side has my drooping eyes flying open, drowsiness forgotten. The jagged stone jutting up from the alley floor has me groggily grumbling, \u201cMark my words, I\u2019m going to steal a cot one day.\u201d Adena rolls her eyes at me, just as she does every night I make the same empty promise. \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I feel it, Pae,\u201d she singsongs. I\u2019ve rolled over about a dozen times before a scratchy, balled-up blanket collides with my head. \u201cIf you don\u2019t quit your squirming, I swear I\u2019ll sew you to the bloody ground,\u201d Adena says with all the sweetness of a sticky bun. \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I feel it, A.\u201d Read more"

I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s this authors first book \ud83e\udd2f prior to reading the book I did read some of the reviews, and a common theme was that this book seemed similar to Red Queen and Hunger Games.. which the author has stated those books gave her inspiration on her book\u2026 I haven\u2019t read either books but did watch the Hunger Games movies, and yes there were similarities\u2026 but this felt different at the same time.There isn\u2019t any spice in this book whatsoever, but omg the tension and angst between the MMC Kai, and FMC Pae, was soooo well written. And even though there was not a single scene with spice, it was not needed with how well written the building of their relationship is. You can totally understand the reasoning for the Pae to hold back, but also feel for how much she wants the Kai\u2026. It\u2019s just so good.This book has the perfect amount of romance AND plot. It\u2019s also dual POV, which I LOVED. My favorite parts were reading in Kai\u2019s POV.There is no insta love in this book, but Kai definitely falls first and hard. He is truly a morally grey character\u2026and the ending \ud83d\udc94 \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffcCan\u2019t wait for the next book! My only regret is reading it so far in advance to the next book",

                "reviewText": "\"Powerless\" by Lauren Roberts is a compelling addition to the young adult fantasy romance genre, offering a blend of deadly trials, well-crafted characters, and a tantalizing slow-burn romance. While the story embraces popular tropes with skillful pacing, it might feel familiar to readers of Hunger Games or Red Queen. Roberts weaves an engaging narrative, introducing us to a world rich in fantasy elements and complexities.The debut novel doesn't shy away from delivering witty banter and tension-filled romance, making it a hit among its target audience. The characters, notably Kai and Paedyn, are imperfectly perfect, adding depth and life to the story. The slow start gradually gives way to a consistent and captivating pace, with the romance unfolding in a deliciously angsty manner.However, some readers may find echoes of The Hunger Games in the early chapters and the Red Queen series throughout, impacting the overall originality. Despite this, the narrative remains enjoyable, laying a solid foundation for the planned trilogy. The predictable ending, though anticipated, carries an impactful twist that leaves readers eager for the next installment.In essence, \"Powerless\" promises an enjoyable journey for romance and young adult enthusiasts. While it may not reinvent the genre, the book's strengths lie in its character complexities, engaging romance, and the potential for an exciting trilogy ahead. Dive into this world of trials and tribulations, and you might find a new favorite series in the making.",

                "reviewText": "If you're looking for a fantasy book, rivals to lovers, flirting, slow-burn, tension, action, twists and turns, and a fierce MFC and a flirty MMC, then Powerless is for you.I LOVED this book SO. MUCH. It was pretty fast paced for most of it, but what made be take off some points was because the start was kind of slow and it didn't really show why the trials happened, even though you can search it and it's kind of obvious. If you're wondering, it's pretty much to kill the Ordinaries in the kingdom. But this book is so much more. It's a duel point of view, and the characters are amazing. It's funny and romacntic and the tension and flirting between Kai and Paedyn is MWAH. It was literally perfect and had me hooked the whole time. I feel so stupid for not picking up this book before because IT'S SOOO GOOD. I sometimes even got mad at the author (in a good way) because of the twist and turns and THE ENDING. The ending was a twist but not too much, and it was SO SAD too. I felt so many different emotions just WOW. I devoured this book. I first got it from the library but IMMEDIATELY ran to Amazon so I can get my own copy of it. I love this book SO SO SO much and I promise it won't leave you disappointed unless you're used to reading like REALLY REALLY fantasy and slow burn books. Also don't read it if you read Red Queen or Hunger Games. I haven't read either so the plot isn't so bad, but if you did you might find it boring because it's a mix of the plots from both books.Overall I LOVED and DEVOURED this book and I recommend it to anyone that's starting fantasy or YA romance. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book and just O.M.G. PLEASE READ IT !!",

                "reviewText": "Now THIS is how you write tension!! Hats off to Lauren Roberts for physically having me on the edge of my seat while reading this book. This is an absolutely astounding debut novel, I found myself completely immersed, devouring it in practically one sitting because it was just that addicting!I felt very Hunger Games meets The Serpent and the Wings of Night vibes from the beginning, but don't be fooled, this is a masterpiece all in it's own!!This is a book is truly designed for those who crave a true romantic fantasy, it encompasses every element that I love with a few more that I didn't even realize I needed! As a devout fan of the forbidden love trope, this one hit all the right notes. Paedyn and Kai were utterly captivating, I couldn't get enough of their interactions. The tension and banter were not only fulfilling but also entertaining! There is the perfect combination of action, tension, romance and intrigue to keep the reader hooked the entire way through.Paedyn, as the leading female character, was a force to be reckoned with. Her storyline will have you on her side from the very beginning, she is courageous, tenacious and has a heart of gold! She embodied a refreshing and fun character, and I can't wait to see the twists and turns that this series has in store for her. Kai is intriguing and incredibly charming, his interactions with Pae allowed the reader to feel their palpable chemistry. His own intriguing backstory only adds to the excitement, and I'm eagerly anticipating more of his character's development. We also get to meet a host of side characters, some who I really hope are a larger part of the next part in this series!This book is a must-read for anyone enamored with romantasy! It seamlessly weaves together all of the essential elements while still feeling fresh and unique in it\u2019s own way!",
