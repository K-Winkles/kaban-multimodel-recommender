                "reviewText": "Lasgol is the orphaned son of an Elite First Ranger who was killed three years previously as a traitor to the king. Small for his age, especially compared to the large boys in his village, he is scorned by nearly everyone where ever he goes. Taken in by an old, alcoholic, one-eyed veteran who frequently berates him and punishes him, the boy remains optimistic that life is good and someday he will clear his father\u2019s name. Lasgol never waivers in the belief that his father, who taught him the ways of the Forest, archery, tracking, trapping and a belief in himself did not betray his king who was also his close friend.During his 15th year Lasgol is offered the opportunity to go to Ranger school as is the right of those whose parents or grandparents served as Rangers. The recruiter who comes for him warns him that accepting will be far more difficult than what he experiences in his village as everyone will hate him as the Traitor\u2019s son. It is a very difficult choice but Lasgol decides this presents a path to clear his father\u2019s name. Before he leaves, he discovers the old veteran had hidden away a package that had been sent to him 3 years before after his fathers death. When he finds it, amongst his fathers clothing is a box with an egg which is quite mystifying. He ends up packing this box with an egg with his meager belongings on the two week trek to the boats that will take them to the Ranger Camp.When Lasgol and his recruiter arrive to where the boats are waiting to take all 80 initiates to the camp the mood of the story shifts from somber to laugh out loud funny as it describes 40 teenage boys and girls with their first experience of rowing a longboat, two teens per bench and per oar. I laughed until I had tears as I remembered my own childhood experiences learning how to row my grandfathers\u2019 old, heavy, wooden rowboat at the lake.The introduction of his new friends and roommates with the indomitable Ingrid as the leader of their group of six expands the book into an adventure where they all must successfully learn various skills as well as physical fitness to earn their placement to graduating their first year. The story increases in tension and plot twists as hate filled looks and insults are flung Lasgol\u2019s way and murderous attempts are made on his life. There\u2019s sort of a Harry Potter kind of feeling to the camaraderie of the fifteen year old group and their trials and tribulations which I enjoyed tremendously. Of course, that mysterious egg plays a vital and unexplainable role in helping Lasgol clear his father\u2019s name.This book is awesome, I couldn\u2019t put it down and stayed up way past my bedtime last night. And thank you, dear editor, for your amazing job. I so appreciate a well edited book which seems to be hard to come by on Kindle Unlimited in this type of genre. This was a suggestion in my Kindle Unlimited list and I am SO glad there is a second book I can read right away.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this book for my wife because she enjoys a good fantasy story. This one looked promising. According to her, the prose leaves a bit to be desired but the plot is well structured and promises an engaging and epic narrative. We are currently on book three, and are enjoying the series!One thing she told me is that Pedro likes to use the word 'Arcane' in his writing. Now that it's been pointed out, I can't unsee it!All in all, an enjoyable read. Keep churning the books out Pedro!",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoyed this book and immediately bought the rest of the series. There is a fairly large group of very varied characters rather than a small group it is clear that plots in different timelines are coming to fruition and the world itself is complex. Not quite up there with Kurtz and her Dhryni, Mercedes Lackey and her Heralds etc and Andre Norton with her Witch WorldBut it is the first book I have read by this author and I have high hopes. They have even made a totally new type of academy setting and set of priorities work incredibly well with a large group of protagonists who are not just good and evil.",

I got pulled into the story. You will fall in love with each characters personality. I feel like you are there in the scenery and with the characters. It is easy to read and follow along with. After blazing through the first book I have now purchased the entire series.",
