I fully expected copies of the old vol 1 TPB that only has the first story arch in it- like 6 issues. Imagine my surprised when this monster arrives with the first 3 story arcs, 20 issues- this is less than $1 per comic! Absolutely bonkers!Now, I'm not going to buy the rest of this edition, because I have the Absolute Editions on my shelf, but I think there's a very good chance my 3 friends will want to continue this series and will be picking up the rest.All that talk about this particular edition out of the way, as you can guess, I believe Sandman is one of the greatest comics ever produced. It's a beautiful story, rich in imagination and poetry and art. If you've never read it, buy this version (again, less than $1 per comic, CRAZY) and dive right in.",

Although there were stories I liked more and stories I liked less I had an amazing time reading this very dark and thought provoking collection. The world building is done over all the installments and the more comics I read, the more I started to admire how well thought out everything seemed! Although the artwork is not really my style it does fit the story and the characters and the world. I got that excited that I already got the next collection!",
