This is like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in that there is a ridiculously long, drawn out middle \u201ccamping\u201d section that could have been pared down significantly.Aledra is the daughter of a Drakkoni (dragon shifter) general and a half-blood woman. Raised with little involvement from her father and none from her biological mother, she is brought to the castle for her 18th birthday, where her stepmother\u2019s death triggers a string of events. Escaping from the castle and the violence, Aledra disguises herself as a male Esran (human tribe) and pairs with another refugee that she rescues.The \u201cromance\u201d in this is about as implausible as the romance in Mulan. The middle is long and drawn out, but the beginning and the end were pretty solid. This book could have also used another round of editing.",

This is my first read from Sue Bentley, and it certainly won\u2019t be my last. I cannot wait to continue on in this series.I absolutely love Aledra. Her journey from a young child to a powerful badass warrior was fun to read about. I think Sue Bentley handled the amount of characters in this story really well. It took me a bit to get them all straight, but when it all came together it made sense.I really enjoyed the world-building in this novel. The clans were interesting, the cultures and rules. I love how put together and consistent it all was. Sue Bentley has created a really cool world in Second Skin, and I think it will only get better with future novels in the series.I highly recommend checking out Second Skin! Now go get your copy!*I received a complimentary copy of this book as part of a blog tour with Random Things Tours. All opinions are my own.*",

It could have used some additional editing for typographical errors and slow spots that needed trimming. It also had a second plot line and antagonist for some reason and I never fully understood the point. I\u2019m guessing that this is the first book of a series and maybe some of the major questions left in this book might get explained later, but who knows how long that might take. The characters are well written and you love the ones you\u2019re supposed to love and hate the ones you\u2019re supposed to hate. If I ever run across the next book I\u2019ll probably read it, but I don\u2019t know that I would actively seek it out.",

I just imagine what it would be like to find myself in another skin altogether - the skin of a very different begin ... Highly recommended.",

Its rich descriptive language immerses you in another world, but one which is at the same time believable which I personally like.
