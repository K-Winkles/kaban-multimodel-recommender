                "reviewText": "WARNING: I'll be getting into a few details about the storyline so if you'd rather not know anything about details here is my TLDR: Cute art but the plot and character development are lacking. It is good to be viewed as a light read to pass the time with some very cute visuals.I bought this book mainly because I loved the art style and that did not disappoint me. Very vibrant and cutesy. The storyline was ok but it left much to be desired. It seemed to focus on the intricacies of Ray's career \u2014 going deep into her visions careerwise and it just didn't amount to that much in the bigger picture. And what was up with the memory erasure? Why wasn't more explained about that? Laurie's aunt doesn't even know why she left her career that she was clearly the most talented in. Why isn't anyone even remotely concerned that their government has this kind of power? Not to make a cute book sinister but any government that has the power to erase your memory if you leave your career should at the very least be questioned. I thought there would be a bigger revelation Ray would come to realize about that career path possibly not being all that great but there were never any solid answers. I also thought Ray and Laurie's relationship happened too soon and had little to go off of. They talked very little about their lives outside of their aspirations. It seems that ultimately the author wanted to say a lot but just couldn't connect the dots cohesively. Even with all that being said, the book is worth the look as a fun, easy read with great inclusion of BIPOC characters as long as you can manage your expectations.",
