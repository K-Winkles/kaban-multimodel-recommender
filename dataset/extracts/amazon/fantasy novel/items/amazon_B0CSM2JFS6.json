They've returned the childlike wonder I had at stories of fantasy.This series is a slow progression, but every stride, every achievement that our protagonist makes feels nothing short of completing a major quest. You know the feeling as a gamer... the sense of accomplishment and pride at having overcome a great trial. It boggles my mind how the author manages to create that feeling over and over for me.Book 3 in the series Hell Mode brings our party to Academy City for the military academy arc, if you could call it that. It's packed with action, pog gamer moments, and Allen's shenanigans and plans to overcome the gruesome, seemingly never-ending requirements to level up in Hell Mode.I thank the author for this amazing series, and I will continue to voraciously devour every volume that comes out. Thank you for entertaining me so thoroughly and for creating a series that has inspired me to one day write my own series like this one.",

Are you looking for something that doesn\u2019t devolve into a DragonBall Z-esque drag on lengths of battles? Are you tired of MC\u2019s that are oblivious or creepers? The main character doesn\u2019t try to change the world (intentionally) to reflect his old world and just enjoyable to be around. We finally get to see a glimmer of how the main character is different than those in \u201cnormal mode\u201d and it\u2019s refreshing.Overall a great read that doesn\u2019t involve you suspending your disbelief or morals to enjoy.",

(it s efficient that it is) plot for one of the new characters.Some Occasional comic reliefs with the known cast and it s not bad considering \"all the characters there is\" and how much the story does manage to progress in. Single volume. To do that however we get most of the time a faraway point of view which sums up things that happened for long periods of time slowing only from time to time before speeding up and getting further up from the plot again.On the good side of things it s not bad or anything and we avoid a 2 volume arc with unnecessary lengths, I just hope it does t become a habit.Also still takes the time to be a bit edgy at times.Not a bad read or anything, but it went from a surprise which made we want to read what came next as soon as it came to a somewhat decent isekai who will not always go for the clich\u00e9, which I will probably not drop but that I no longer look forward to.",
