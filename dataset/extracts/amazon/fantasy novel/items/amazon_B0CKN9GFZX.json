It\u2019s detailed, laid out in an easy-to-use manner, and I\u2019m always a sucker for a velvety matte finish. This book has it all. From a cover design/color that speaks to the genre all the way to thought-provoking questions. From character profile pages (and I freaking adore the villain badness scale) all the way to useful gold nuggets like character traits and helpful websites. From a section on magic all the way to information on world building. Plus, there are plenty of pages for notes. Did I mention it\u2019ll fit in my purse, so it\u2019ll be handy at all times? That\u2019s a huge win in my book - pun intended. I highly recommend with five shiny stars.Oh, and hey. NaNoWriMo, I\u2019m coming for you!",
