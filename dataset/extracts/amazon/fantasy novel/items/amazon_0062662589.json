Jemisin\u2019s Inheritance Trilogy.When Rin aced the Keju\u2014the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies\u2014it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn\u2019t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin\u2019s guardians, who believed they\u2019d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard\u2014the most elite military school in Nikan\u2014was even more surprising.But surprises aren\u2019t always good.Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power\u2014an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive\u2014and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . .Rin\u2019s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.",

FRTC?This coming-of-age military fantasy has plenty of v*olence (vividly gruesome scenes), so please be aware of this before you pick it up. Also - dr*gs..TPW is inspired by the Second Sino-Japanese War, sparked by a dispute between Chinese and Japanese troops, that escalated into a full-scale invasion. In 'Note from the Author' Kuang provides several titles/resources that introduces us to historic events between these countries. Some events that were written (like scenes from Golyn Niis, battle at Khurdalain) portray very real things that happened. Very little was made up.There was no time for me to be bored and I inhaled chapter after chapter like there's no tomorrow. War is not romanticized. And I'm glad for this brutality.Funny thing is, before I picked up this book (and I had bought the trilogy a while ago), I knew I would be enthralled by this. I don't know why. I knew it would make an impact on me and I can't wait to delve into the next 2 books (sadly after my current arcs). But man oh man, what a memorable book.",

                "reviewText": "Last year I began a review of Guy Gavriel Kay's All the Seas of the World with these words:How to describe Guy Gavriel Kay's books? He is a genre of his own. His novels live somewhere between fantasy and historical fiction. He has borrowed the words \"a quarter turn to the fantastic\" from a reviewer to describe it.I was mistaken. Kay is not alone. R.F. Kuang's The Poppy War is a fantasy with a similar relationship to history as Kay's. There are many valid reasons to dislike or feel uneasy about this approach to historical fiction. Kay has eloquently explained his approach in an essay entitled \"On the Strengths of Fiction Done as Near-History\". I find it persuasive.Now, Kuang is not as self-aware as Kay. But The Poppy War was her debut novel, while Kay has been publishing novels since 1984. Without attributing Kay's thoughts to Kuang, it is not unreasonable to read Kay's essay with The Poppy War in mind and ask oneself how well it works as an explanation. I think it works well.The Poppy War is divided into three parts. Part I is a story you have read a hundred times before: the poor kid who somehow gets into a school for rich kids, is looked down on by almost everyone, but somehow through merit or spirit or plain intelligence transcends her underdog status. This one is a little more brutal than the average, but not outside the usual range.Parts II and III are the most recognizably historical. They are based on events of the Second Sino-Japanese War, most obviously the Battle of Shanghai and the Nanjing Massacre, and also on later events of World War II. The Nanjing Massacre was, no exaggeration, one of the most horrible things to happen in human history, so expect the story to become very, very dark. My title refers to The Poppy War as a revenge fantasy, because it feels to me as if Kuang is getting revenge for the horrors the Japanese inflicted on China. As an American, I also recognized a US World War II event. You will, too, and it will be obvious to you that Kuang intended it.Overall, I thought this was a good story, brutal but honestly so. I am not sure if I will continue with the series.",

                "reviewText": "\u201cWhen had she last been this scared? Had she felt this paralysis, this numbing dread before she stepped into the ring with Nezha two years ago? No, she had been angry then, and proud. She had thought she was invincible. She had been looking forward to the fight, anticipating the bloodlust. That felt stupid now. So, so stupid. War was not a game, where one fought for honor and admiration, where masters would keep her from sustaining any real harm. War was a nightmare.\"By now, I\u2019m sure most people who are even remotely a part of the bookish community have heard about The Poppy War. This book came out in 2018 and has been talked about pretty much non-stop ever since! It appeared on my TBR after a severe case of FOMO had me adding a bunch of book community darlings on Goodreads. And there it sat\u2026 collecting dust and shaming me as I continued to pick up different, newer books. That was until I joined a buddy read with some awesome bookish folks on Twitter! It was just the push I needed to finally give this book a go and see if I would like it.Y\u2019all. This book destroyed me. I was in such a book hangover after finishing it that I barely got through three other books in October. It was a struggle! After all that waiting, I finally realize why everyone was raving about this story!We\u2019re following a young war orphan named Rin, who is in the care of drug dealers who use her to help them with their seedy business. When they decide to force Rin into an arranged marriage, she decides that she needs to GTFO. She starts studying for the Keju, a test used throughout the Empire to pick people to send to the numerous academies. Rin figures if she gets a good enough score, she can escape to an academy instead of being stuck in a marriage she does not want. Well, not only does she receive a good enough score, she aces the test and is sent to the most prestigious academy in the entire country: Sinegard. Once there, she has to fight against prejudice, her classmates, and her own mind to prove she\u2019s more than what she seems.I always have issues writing reviews for my five star reads. All I want to do is scream at everyone to read the book! Of course, a lot of people already have read this book, so I suppose I should try and be a little more coherent \ud83d\ude02 So let\u2019s try breaking this down into the main things I loved about this book. Besides everything.First, the writing. Oof, the writing! Talk about being captured in a narrative through beautiful writing alone! I\u2019m not talking about purple prose\u2026 there\u2019s nothing purple about Kuang\u2019s writing. I\u2019m talking about writing that flows and twists in such a way that you soon find yourself lost in the pages. There are so many quotable passages that it took me forever to pick a favorite! I just loved everything about her prose. It made the pages fly by! That and the incredible pacing. I was kept on the edge of my seat even when nothing particularly exciting was happening. I was so wrapped up in Rin\u2019s development and her journey that even her running up and down a mountain with a pig on her back seemed fascinating, lol.Speaking of Rin, can we talk about how R.F. Kuang crafted such compelling characters??? I\u2019m honestly in awe. Not only Rin, but Jiang and Kitay and Nezha and Altan and all of them practically leap off the page! Rin makes a lot of\u2026 questionable choices, but I connected with her so much. I was completely invested in her journey. I felt her anger and I felt her pain. I wanted to shake her and I wanted to hug her all at the same time! She\u2019s just such a dynamic and vibrant character who will pull you even further to the world. And, as I said, the characters that are pulled into her orbit are equally brilliant and intriguing. They all have such depth and color that they can\u2019t help but shine! I haven\u2019t been so invested in a bunch of fictional characters in quite some time.Last, let\u2019s talk about the world-building. I love when an author can weave the world-building into the story so that it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re reading a textbook. R.F. Kuang managed this throughout The Poppy War. You learned about the world almost subconsciously, picking up tidbits of information as Rin goes on her journey from the Rooster Province to Sinegard to war. It made it really easy to fall into the world and lose yourself as you read. It made the scenes come to life in my mind, vivid and bloody and haunting. And I think this is the main reason I had such a massive book hangover! I was so trapped in the world that every other book I picked up felt boring and flat in comparison. Makes me nervous to finish the sequel, The Dragon Republic, this month before all the other books I\u2019m reading\u2026Overall, this book is incredible and I cannot wait to continue the series! Even if I\u2019m scared to do so at the same time \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02",
