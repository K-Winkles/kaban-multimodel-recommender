                "reviewText": "Wow! I had so much fun with this! Such a great mythological time! Lol! Athena always knew she was smart & special, but she didn\u2019t realize that she was a goddess! When she\u2019s whisked away to Mount Olympus Academy, she worries about fitting in & dealing with her dad, Zeus. Luckily, she meets the Goddess Girls & finds the best friends she\u2019s ever had. This was such a great take on Greek mythology. Having the goddess girls & godboys going to school at Mount Olympus-with Zeus as Principal lol. Loved seeing the authors take on how school might go for them. Many of the same worries & issues young people can relate to-along with some that are un-relatable lol like magic, etc. of course. This follows Athena who finds out she is a goddess, & Zeus is her dad! And he wants her to come to school! Lol With the help of a great group of friends she makes when she gets there, she slowly learns the new ways of her life, & gets more comfortable & confident. I loved the friendship dynamics in here so much. Great humor as well. I loved how Medusa\u2019s story is playing out so far, & can\u2019t wait to see more there-see more of everything actually. I loved this! The the cover by Manuel Preitano & art by Eduardo Garcia is STUNNING too! So in love. Great adaptation by David Campiti also I now want to buy the books & read the series as well! Lol Highly recommend! Already halfway through the 2nd one!\ud83d\udc9c",
