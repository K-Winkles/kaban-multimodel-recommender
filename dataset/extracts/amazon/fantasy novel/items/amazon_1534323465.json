After arriving late to his first assignment, Twig and his snarky, yellow slug-like companion Splat are given a glowing red gem and instructed to take it to the Pathsayer, a diviner of mystical objects\u2019 origins. But when the pair show up at the Pathsayer\u2019s residence, they find him dead. Using the Pathsayer\u2019s tools, Twig determines the gem\u2019s destination, severely damaging it in the process, and the duo embark on a series of side quests to repair it before a \u201cdarkness covering all things\u201d descends upon the world. The narrative\u2019s gentle tone smartly contrasts the art\u2019s occasionally grotesque visuals; in brilliantly hued palettes, Strahm renders distorted landscapes populated by innovative technologies, anthropomorphic ruins, and softly rounded critters sporting an astounding array of teeth.

                "reviewText": "Great compact comic. Art and colors are fantastic and the glimpse of this world Twig is in on each page packs in a lot of creativity. I thought it was a unique take--its not \"complete the quest\" but \"complete the quest so that the main hero can complete the quest\". Of course, wish it was longer, more fleshed out, but I think you should buy it, it's a neat little book.",

The artwork & story is very creative.I bought this book as I liked the artwork on some of the comics so I gave it a chance and turned out to be one of my most favorite reads to date!This is great for all ages. If you're like me, you're around 38 and enjoy Art, Animation & Cute Stories such as the \"Stray Dogs\" series, this book is for you!If you're young and just like a good story with imaginative fantasy like artwork, you will absolutely love this book!No adult themes or anything, this is purely cute & awesome!If there is more to the series later, I will definitely be keeping up on it.",

I felt more emotion from Splat and Lobee. It also felt a little empty in the sense that the comedy didn\u2019t quite hit - but I am a 22 year old so it\u2019s probably because I\u2019m a young adult reading a childrens book \ud83d\ude02Other than those things, this was a really cute and intriguing read. I absolutely adore Lobee to my core !",
