Their days are filled with laughter, silly little arguments, and even a more feminine version of Ivy! Yet trouble looms on the horizon when Ivy and her crew happen upon a village facing an abnormally harsh winter. With new people to meet, fire to sit by, and hungry bellies to fill, it looks like Ivy's work is cut out for them. Good thing they've got lots of friends to help keep warm!",

                "reviewText": "I've read the entire series so far and I'd say this is a worthwhile read. I enjoy Sora, Flame, and Ciel the most of all! They are full of surprises and make the economic and magic aspects of the series exciting and fun. I'm very happy Ivy found a papa after her biological dad tried to MURDER her! Druid and Ivy having a proper father-daughter relationship is very refreshing and happy to see. I love their travel through the woods and the cave before getting to Halow. I love the first scenes the most. The writers detail is appreciated and described beautifully. I love picturing how the skins bounce around and how Ciel runs. I love that rice has entered the building!Cons:I wish the human relationships felt more natural. Generally the relationships feel stiff. Druid's parents are my least favorite characters. They just blame their older sons for being mean to Druid while taking no responsibility for who they fostered that environment. They just say those boys are stupid and we love you, always have. Yeah right, they hadn't visited him in decades including after he got his arm ripped off. \ud83d\ude33 That does not sound like loving parents to me. Honestly, those scenes were insufferable and cringe. My least favorite of the series so far. Also, could we get some consistency on Ivy calling Druid dad? I hope for future series the authors tries to make the conversations between people more natural. There are too many forces haha good vibes scenes without it really making sense, especially for such a nervous skiddish young girl. It's so strange to me how Ivy is so afraid of EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE (jumping all the time and stuttering nervously) but she quickly tells her deepest secrets to people she's barely just met. At this point it feels like she's flexing the confidence of her power while trying to go *he he* \ud83e\udd2d but I'm a harmless shy little thing and my creatures are cuties. I'm happy if she's becoming more confident but the writing just doesn't logically match up. I hope that the advice Ivy give, what she thinks in her head, what she says and what she does start to line up more so she doesn't seem like a hypocritical or shallow character.",
