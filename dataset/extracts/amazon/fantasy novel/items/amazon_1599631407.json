                "reviewText": "My big gripe is I bought this book listed as brand new sold by Amazon.com. And what I received was an obviously used book that has a scruffle at the top corner on the spine, and the front cover is creased. The pages are slightly yellowing. I'm keeping it, but it shouldn't have been sold as new so I'm knocking off a star. That being said, this book is the required reading material for a workshop via Writer's Digest, (now owned by Penguin Random House) titled 'Writing the Science Fiction & Fantasy Novel.' It's over $300 so I thought I'd read the book solo, plus the book looks like it's pretty decent without an instructor. At the least it may inspire a few thoughts or ideas. If you're brand new it'll be helpful as it gives you the general layout of how fantasy usually goes, but if you're smart you'll use it as a launching pad for going beyond the concepts given. If you're already experienced you probably won't find it as helpful, so I'd list this as a great starting point for someone just starting out. Or a decent reminder for someone who isn't. But that's just my opinion.",
