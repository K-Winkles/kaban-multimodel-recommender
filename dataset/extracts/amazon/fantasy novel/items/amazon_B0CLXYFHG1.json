Lot of exposition with the MC exploring the game mechanics and the world and how it impact her builds including on a few occasions a long description of items and skills. It is also not as if the MC is facing much difficulties, her life is easy, although at least this book (unlike other popular on-line gaming series) acknowledges that in a MMO you do have jerk players (except that no popular MMO RPG would make PKing this easy in RL). Still, I find the characters and story entertaining enough to keep reading the series and that is what matters.",
