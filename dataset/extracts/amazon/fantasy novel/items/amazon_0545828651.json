He told me this was his favorite of all the books. He said the back cover says you\u2019ll be hooked and it was right. He loves it so much he\u2019s now gotten multiple friends to start reading the series. We own 4 (1-3 and 9) of the series. He wants the 5 in the middle so he has them all and can read again whenever he wants.",

Kazu Kibuishi has given us a wonderful fairytale that offers many positive messages about the uses and dangers of power, and the importance of inclusion, redemption, and forgiveness. I look forward to sharing this last installment with young people who have grown up with Emily, Navin, Trellis, Leon, Ikol and all the others. So many of the characters were tied up with a bow. Dagno fans will be disappointed, but just about everyone else gets their moment. Thank you Kazu for taking us to Alledia and beyond.",
