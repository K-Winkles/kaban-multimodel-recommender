                "reviewText": "Hex of the Witch is the second of the Amber DeLea books, a grumpy but endlessly helpful side character from the Other Realm and Other Wolf series. It's clear in those series that Amber has a heart of gold and a heartbreaking backstory. We've seen more than a little of that story in Rune and Hex of a Witch, in Coven Amber really starts to shine and we learn even more of her secrets, and those being kept from her.Amber is out to put a stop to the Black Witches and track down those in her Coven and the Liverpool Coven. With Bastian by her side, she really stirs up trouble. I love the layers of mystery and intrigue that Heather Harris weaves throughout her tales. This one is just as un-put-downable as the rest.I loved this part of Amber's story and am immediately starting Familiar of the Witch to find out what happens next!",

                "reviewText": "I almost took off a star from the abrupt cliffhanger. It was a cr@ppy way to leave the book. Out of all The Other World Series books, I think Amber's storyline is the absolute best. It's well written and Amber is a character you can get behind. A strong yet vulnerable main female lead who also admits when she is wrong. She has such a sweet soul that she hides behind a tough exterior. Her moments with Benji make me tear up.First, if you are thinking of starting with this series. Stop!!! Read Jinx and then Lucy's story first. I made the mistake when I read the first book. There needs to be a better time-line somewhere. Jinx's storyline breaks down The Other World very well.Now, back to the business at hand. This second book was better than the first, and I am so excited for the next book to come. I finished this in hours, sneaking in a read here and there.This starts off not too long after the last book. Amber is still trying to root out more black coven members, and while she does this, you see growth in her as she learns to delegate, trust, and lower her barriers. We learn a bit more about Amber's Mom and get some very shocking revelations. I don't want to say much as it might spoil the story. But twists and turns, sad happenings, and progress. The banter between Bastion and Amber here..chef's kiss.I feel as if with her other female characters in this series, she made her main leads come across as teenagers crushing and blushing. You still get some of that with these two, but it's definitely much more mature. Lucy and Greg were a bit frustrating for me as Lucy was coming across as some school kid when dealing with Greg. And I'm normally shy, but some it was just ridiculous and kiddie.Overall, this was great and a must read!! I may just read both books over again.",

Harris\u2019s Other World.",

Not that Heather is a freakin T E A S E for the entire last chapter, nor the fact that I\u2019m so frustrated right now that I\u2019d have thrown this across the room if it had been an actual book instead of my Kindle. Noooo, not gonna mention any of that.Y\u2019all, this was a great, solid, awesome story until she dumps us on our bums at the end. It has all of our favorite characters doing our favorite things. Lots and lots of tension, near-death experiences, potions, mysteries, explosions, and one notable meeting with the ogre king.I mean, I was racing through it as best as I could, what with needing to work and sleep and stuff. But man, the story was intense! If you liked the first book, I guarantee you\u2019ll LOVE this second one. Like, a solid money-back guarantee. Except for the last chapter. I will not refund your money if you\u2019re as unhappy as I am at the ending. In fact, I don\u2019t even want to talk about it. See? This is me shutting up about the %+^#?! cliffhanger ending.Mostly because I\u2019m going to get started on book 3 in about 2 seconds\u2026",

                "reviewText": "Love how the main character, Amber is written. You get to see her flaws and strengths. The growth of the character through this book and series has been fantastic. The book keeps you suspended in drama as the main character goes from one dramatic moment to another. While the book references characters from her other book series, it isn't necessary to read them if you haven't. Although I do recommend it! They are awesome! I can't wait to see what happens next in the series. I devoured this book in one day. I do wish the author didn't keep telling the same little bits of information in every book, over and over. If we have made it to this book, then we know who Benji is, who Bastion is and that griffins have to kill or go insane. It almost feels like fluff and filler information to make the book appear longer. However, it doesn't necessarily deter away from the storyline. I highly recommend reading this series. It draws you in from the get go and keeps you there.",

Thankfully Bastion remains Ambers protector, and between him, Oscar and Benji, a golem with a heart of gold, they keep her alive as she hunts down those responsible for the attacks.There\u2019s no relief from the fast pace in this book and it\u2019s a testament to Heathers skill that it doesn\u2019t reach a level of fatigue. She perfectly weaves in moments of intimacy with Bastion, friendship with Benji and family with Oscar in a way that kept my heart on pace with my mind.I loved the little easter eggs that Heather planted in this book, especially the ones that created more questions than answers. It had my brain working over time to see if I could work it out before Amber did.There wasn\u2019t really anything that I didn\u2019t like, to be honest, which is a common theme for me with Heather\u2019s books. It\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s an auto-buy for me!",
