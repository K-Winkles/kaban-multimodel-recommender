                "reviewText": "This Volume has us following the ogre that\u2019s been on a rampage since the last Volume, as well as our usual Demon Lord party. They\u2019ve finally made it to the demon territory, much to the surprise of Sophia and White. Why surprise? Well, it seems the demon territory isn\u2019t that different from the human ones.White and Sophia were expecting things to look like they do in the media back on Earth, but if anything, it\u2019s just as lovely, if not more so than where they\u2019ve stayed in the human countries. Of course that would come as a surprise. Not only that, but it seems that not everyone in the demon territory is onboard with the Demon Lord\u2019s plan to go to war with the humans. That leads to some drama and behind the scenes maneuverings that you wouldn\u2019t expect. I was under the impression that the return of the Demon Lord would be met with fanfare and acceptance, not the veiled hostility and apprehension we get.On top of that, the orge who\u2019s been wreaking havoc doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down at all. If anything, he\u2019s been growing stronger the more he\u2019s been raging. That leads to another confrontation between him, White and Sophia. And man is it an explosive one!We see White start to learn more about her powers and how to control them now that she\u2019s a god. that\u2019s fun, as is seeing how much stronger Sophia\u2019s becoming. Granted, we do have the benefit of knowing how OP they are in the future but the journey there is entertaining. I always enjoy seeing how strong people get their overwhelming strength. It\u2019s why White\u2019s journey has been such a blast to be on!we learn more about the orge, and why he is the way he is. We get to see it from his perspective, which makes his backstory that much harder to swallow. Seriously, the guy can\u2019t catch a break!We also get to meet D, the \u201cevil god\u201d that\u2019s basically behind everything that\u2019s going on. And I do mean actually meet. We\u2019ve \u201cheard\u201d her voice through the smartphone that appears every now and then, but White actually makes the journey to meet D in person, and man oh man are the revelations from that meeting crazy. I won\u2019t say any more than that so as not to spoil anything, but things sure have gotten complicated.All in all, this was a great Volume, that sets up things moving forward, and even though we know where they ultimately lead, there\u2019s no disputing the fact that the journey to the destination will be a crazy one to say the least.",

Example: The use of poisonous and venomous as if they mean the same thing. Example 2: The puppet taratect stats are constantly mentioned but flip-flop between 1,000 average stats and 10,000 average stats. That's a big difference. Example 3: We have a character named Bloe. Okay. Next volume, he's Blow. Maybe an editing correction? Next volume, he's Bloe, again. Please make up your mind.",

Read it again. Then burn your eyes out re-reading them all, it's worth it, as you quickly find out.I can't say much due to spoilers, but my only complaint in this entire volume has to do with the ending. It's a bit too rushed, not just with the reveal, but White's reaction to finally meeting D. Some of that emotional mess could have been carried into the future, where it would benefit greatly with some flushing out and a proper confrontation between the newly \"reborn\" White and Ariel, as those two really do need to talk things out, preferably over a glass (or cask) of wine. We've had far too few moments of characters actually having serious conversations about their experiences since we've delved into White's past at volume 6, but in all fairness, they've been quite busy trying to stave off the end of the world a few times. Plus, the moments where the characters get to act cute more than make up for it.",

                "reviewText": "I normally don't write reviews,but, I guess making one for something that I adore is indeed fun. Let's start! I adore... ADORE this volume, I know some people complained about the story not moving forward much in the past volume. This volume makes up A LOT for the last one, like we get a lot of developments here and set ups for what's to come. And some interesting changes from the web novel. I literally read the volume in like a day (I'm a slow reader), I just couldn't stop!!! It makes sense that things are a bit slower after the whole crazy stuff from volume 7. We get HUGE reveals about the world and characters that will NOT disappoint any of you.",
