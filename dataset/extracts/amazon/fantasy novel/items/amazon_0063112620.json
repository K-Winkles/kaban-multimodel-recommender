        "description": "A brilliant new voice brings us a brilliant new epic fantasy novel: Ehigbor Okosun\u2019s first book in an action-packed, poignant duology inspired by Nigerian mythology\u2014full of magic and emotion and set in a highly atmospheric, complex world in which a young woman fights to survive a tyrannical society, having everything stripped away from her, and seeks vengeance for her mother\u2019s murder and the spilled blood of her people.In the midst of a tyrannical regime and political invasion, D\u00e8mi just wants to survive: to avoid the suspicion of the nonmagical Ajes who occupy her ancestral homeland of Ife; to escape the King\u2019s brutal genocide of her people\u2014the darker skinned, magic wielding Oluso; and to live peacefully with her secretive mother while learning to control the terrifying blood magic that is her birthright.But when D\u00e8mi\u2019s misplaced trust costs her mother\u2019s life, survival gives way to vengeance. She bides her time until the devious Lord Ekwensi grants her the perfect opportunity\u2014kidnap the Aje prince, Jonas, and bargain with his life to save the remaining Oluso. With the help of her reckless childhood friend Colin, D\u00e8mi succeeds, but discovers that she and Jonas share more than deadly secrets; every moment tangles them further into a forbidden, unmistakable attraction, much to Colin\u2019s\u2014and D\u00e8mi\u2019s\u2014distress.The kidnapping is now a joint mission: to return to the King, help get Lord Ekwensi on the council, and bolster the voice of the Oluso in a system designed to silence them. But the way is dangerous, D\u00e8mi\u2019s magic is growing yet uncertain, and it\u2019s not clear if she can trust the two men at her side.A tale of rebellion and redemption, race and class, love and trust and betrayal, Forged by Blood is epic fantasy at its finest, from an enthusiastic, emerging voice.",

                "reviewText": "\u201cForged by Blood\u201d was Fairyloot\u2019s August adult subscription selection and I am so glad it was! The author, @EhigborOkosun, wrote the epic young adult (YA) fantasy inspired by Nigerian mythology - though no previous knowledge is required to read and enjoy the book, though being familiar with Africa\u2019s geography and cultures will be helpful with the imagery. \ud83c\udf0d I certainly was left wanting to know more about Nigerian \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec mythology though!D\u00e8mi is a complex character, introduced as a child during the most traumatic experience of her life (up to that point), and then after a time jump as a young adult. While much about D\u00e8mi\u2019s family and history is unknown, the story never feels confusing or lost. The characters are likable, relatable, and realistic - none are perfect and all are trying to do the right thing in the best way they can. I enjoyed the found family dynamics and was left wanting to know more about so many of the characters, hoping we get some in the second book of the duology. (Or perhaps some character spin-offs later) The story is full of magic and emotion, love and determination. The book addresses racism and discrimination in ways that do not feel overwhelming but recognizes the delicate and atrocious nature of such human experiences. One of the major themes of the story is staying true to oneself, even when it seems impossible. \ud83c\udfe0 \u2694\ufe0f \ud83e\uddda\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0fThere were a few spots in the story, as well as character dialogue, that I thought should have been addressed more thoroughly. There could have been a bit more complex world building, especially in the magical realms. However, I loved D\u00e8mi\u2019s inner dialogue as she worked through emotions, as well as her compassion and love for others while she was also angry and having to fight for survival. Overall this is easily a 4-star read and a book I will be recommending to others and even purchasing as a gift for friends.\u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f",

Okosun shines with the eloquence of her prose as the reader begins to understand the world they are entering.What I loved about this particular book is the multiple layers to the story. At the core, it is about a young girl\u2019s struggles and quest to fight for what is right. However, there are also political power plays, discrimination, enslavement, complicated relationships, and a whole system of blood magic. All of these on their own would be compelling, but together, they form a vivid and well-crafted tale.Because this is the first book in a duology, I understand that there is a lot of background needed to set up the players and build the world. And yet, as the reader, there were I wanted more lore and more about the magic. You see it in action, but questions were lingering about all the facets which made things murky at times.FORGED BY BLOOD is a solid beginning to what could possibly be an epic second book. Okosun\u2019s voice is strong with a wonderful balance of heart and action. I am looking forward to seeing what comes in the next book.",

I will say i'm not a fan of love triangles as i like to know who's heart i'm following and don't like being torn, but it was okay, not a deal breaker at all. Also, Ehigbor's writing is beautiful and a breath of fresh air, i thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to the next book.",

From the world building to the magic system to the imagery to the characters, everything is beautiful.The narrative from Demi regarding the colonisation of her people and the discrimination that she faces are really powerful. The raw emotion behind her words, towards the treatment she receives, from her 9 year old perspective in particular, is so striking. There is no way that you could not be moved by it. The way this affects her perception and treatment of Jonas is really interesting. The theme of friendship and family, and how that looks, is strong throughout.The slow burn romance smoulders away throughout.The plot is strong and so captivating. One of the most beautiful books I've read in a long time. I am absolutely in love with this book, there is nothing that doesn't work.",
