                "reviewText": "I wish this book had been available in English back in 2009. The game would have made so much more sense!If you\u2019ve ever been confused, frustrated, or annoyed by Final Fantasy XIII, it\u2019s probably at least in part because you haven\u2019t read this book. The game throws you into an unfamiliar world, bombards you with foreign words like \u201cl\u2019Cie\u201d and \u201cfal\u2019Cie,\u201d and has you recruit an array of characters without properly introducing them. Why? Because all the world building and character backstories and relationships are explained in Episode Zero: Promise.It\u2019s like how Final Fantasy XV gave us a movie and an anime (and, in Japan, a drama CD), and watching those first helped the game make a lot more sense. Except, unlike Final Fantasy XIII\u2019s prequel content, those were available in English from the get-go. Here we are a decade after this book was published in Japan, just now getting it in the West. *shakes fist at Square-Enix*Even if you hated FFXIII (and, until now, I did), I recommend this book because it will make the confusing scenes of the game connect like puzzle pieces for you. I\u2019m replaying the game now and everything makes so much more sense, it\u2019s incredible. I feel like in the past I had skipped the first disc, and only now do I have the complete game.Here\u2019s a spoiler-free breakdown of the chapters:First there are 8 full-color, glossy pages containing screen shots from the game with captions which provide biographies for allies and foes and geographical information about various locations in the game.Chapter 1, Encounter. Lightning is on patrol and meets NORA\u2014and Snow\u2014for the first time. It does not go well, so Snow offers to help Serah choose a birthday gift for Lightning to reconcile. In this chapter, we discover information about Light and Serah\u2019s parents, and why Lightning changed her name to \u201cLightning.\u201d And we see how Serah became a l\u2019Cie.Chapter 2, Strangers. This chapter is all about Vanille and Fang, and how they woke up and survived on Cocoon. This was one of the best chapters, because you see how the people of Cocoon live day-to-day, discovering it at the same time as Fang and Vanille, who are essentially two foreigners.Chapter 3, Treasure. Here we see how Sazh got his chocobo and how Dajh became a l\u2019Cie. You learn a lot about the Public Security and Intelligence Command (PSICOM) and the villain characters, Jihl Nabaat and Yaag Rosch, and discover how Sazh lost his wife. Probably the most important chapter in the book, for all the information it provides.Chapter 4, Search. This entire chapter is about how Fang came to be aboard the Lindblum and their lengthy, failed search for Vanille. While she is involved with the Guardian Corps Wide-Area Response Brigade (GC-WARB)/The Cavalry, we learn about Cid Raines\u2019s motivations for helping her, and parts of the chapter are written from the perspective of Captain Rygdea. I really loved his character so it was awesome to spend time getting to know him!Chapter 5, Friends. This chapter explores Hope\u2019s relationship (or lack thereof) with each of his parents. The majority of it is a flashback to Hope\u2019s childhood and an adventure he shared in the Sunleth Waterscape with his school friends while on a field trip. (If you don\u2019t remember Sunleth Waterscape, that\u2019s the random rainforest-looking place that Sazh and Vanille appear in during the game. The book explains that it is a nature preserve where monsters are studied. And those floating bubbles that change the weather from sunshine to rain are explained in the book, as well.)Chapter 6, Present. Serah searches for the perfect birthday gift for Lightning; meanwhile, although he accompanies her, Snow is actually looking for an engagement gift for Serah. A lot of cute, silly fluff. I love Serah and Snow so it was nice to see them together in scenes like this.Chapter 7, Tomorrow. A far-off flashback to how Vanille and Fang first became l\u2019Cie on Pulse. Then it jumps to the present and explains how Vanille ended up on a Purge train with Hope, Nora, Lightning, and Sazh. And we know the rest, because this is where the game begins.So there\u2019s a LOT of information about the people, history, world, and main characters in this book that you absolutely do not want to miss, whether you\u2019re a fan of the game or didn\u2019t like it so much. It really made me appreciate it more, now that I understand where the characters are coming from and the world they\u2019re in.",

                "reviewText": "It is helpful for understanding one of the worst games in the final fantasy series. I bought it out of necessity not because I actually wanted to read it. Good luck trudging through the game with or without reading this book. The book itself I have no complaints. It helped a little where the game was most convoluted, so it gets 4stars from me.",

Ho apprezzato molto quello su Lightning e Vanille e Fang, che ho trovato anche in certe parti anche un p\u00f2 commoventi. Unica pecca \u00e8 che il libro \u00e8 solo in inglese",

Amarra algumas pontas. N\u00e3o \u00e9 uma leitura imprescind\u00edvel para a compreens\u00e3o do enredo mas ele com certeza melhora a experi\u00eancia do jogador e muito. O come\u00e7o \u00e9 meio lento mas depois \"engata\" e fica bem melhor.",
