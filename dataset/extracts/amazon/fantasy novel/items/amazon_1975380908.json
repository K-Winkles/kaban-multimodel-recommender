                "reviewText": "The isekai trope is quickly becoming overwrought in Japanese entertainment such as anime, manga, and light novels, but as a fan of Final Fantasy video games, I'm really enjoying the way this author uses the trope as a means to bring in references to many past Final Fantasy games while creating something entirely new and entirely shounen as well as a means of pushing the story along and giving it emotional weight.The story feels at once very fresh and at the same time very in-line with classic Final Fantasy games. Thus far, I'd say it leans more toward the classics than to the Final Fantasy games, such as many of the PlayStation entries and onward, that showcase to some extent or another a more modern setting, but this is not a complaint by any means and is likewise a potential necessity for the story being told.Final Fantasy: Lost Stranger showers love on fans of the Final Fantasy games with reinterpretations of characters, items, and ideas from throughout the series, and I especially love how each chapter is named after a music track from a Final Fantasy game. The book even tells you where each track comes from in the translation notes at the end.Final Fantasy: Lost Stranger is a wonderous and wonderful adventure into the world, or a world, of Final Fantasy that implements many elements which fans will find familiar yet entirely unique while also infusing a very shounen-manga feel to it's protagonist and story, which will feel right at home to anyone who enjoys anime, and I will be reading this series to its conclusion. It's been wonderful so far, and I hope for my friends out there averse to reading that it one day gets the anime treatment it deserves. For everyone not afraid of words on a page or of storytelling via sequential images, it is a fantastic read. Let your imagination run wild.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this series! I've never been interested in anime or manga and I'm not the biggest gamer. Still, the book piqued my interest because I am a huge Final Fantasy fan and have been playing since the NES days. I may have just become a manga fan!First, the art is just amazing! The illustrations alone are worth purchasing this book. A dragon in book is amazingly detailed and well drawn. What\u2019s also great is all of the references to past FF titles that you come across. Each chapter is named after a music title from one of the games.The story itself was very enjoyable to me. I know nothing about anime tropes and what is or isn\u2019t overdone, but I liked this just fine. You already see character development and it\u2019s only the first volume. You see Shogo start to \u201cfind himself\u201d and figure out a way to do what has to be done. I like all the characters, but I gotta say Duston is my favorite. :) The ending leaves you hanging though. If you\u2019re like me you might pick up your phone and order the next volume immediately. It did take me a little while to get used to reading the opposite way, but I got used to it about half way through. I would keep reading the sections out of order. :)I don\u2019t want to give away too much, but I\u2019m absolutely hooked and looking forward to what this series has in store in the future!",

                "reviewText": "I was unsure weather or not this would be a mindless cash-in. Yes, it\u2019s another Isekai, but if you\u2019re an FF fan this is still a really fun adventure, and feels like such a love-letter to fans and the series as a whole.Volume 1 does a pretty good job of setting things up before the plot really gets going. It also heavily focused on FFXIV nods, but that balances out and other games in the series get represented too as the volumes continue.If you\u2019re open to a fun adventure and don\u2019t mind something that\u2019s not gonna be super deep, this manga will be a good time.I will say my main complaint is that occasionally the set gets super busy and made me wish it was all printed on a larger format to make it easier to figure out what was going on. However this was only in a few instances and it was not something there hindered my enjoyment of the manga.I\u2019ve read up to volume 8 now and can\u2019t wait for volume 9.",

                "reviewText": "So I love the concept of a jaded Square Enix employee being sent into another world, but I feel like the plot twist with the sister was too rushed. It didn't give me enough time to grow to like her, which made her feel a bit like a plot device for the protagonist Shogo's goals and ambitions (which is a bit sad).Besides that, the world is interesting and I love how the mc is so passionate about FF! His ability is also awesome, I cannot wait to see him and his oddball party become super strong one day. I like when isekai stories start the characters as weak rather than strong, because it gives ample space for character growth and improvement. I love their picnic scenes, that guy is an awesome cook and the random comedy bits were quite good too.",
