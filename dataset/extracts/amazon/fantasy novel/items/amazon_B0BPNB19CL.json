                "reviewText": "Brandon Sanderson is, by far, one of the most talented & creative writers today. S I was looking forward to this book. But when I started, I was a little disappointed - it seemed very ... simple, almost appropriate for a pre-teen. I considered putting it down several times. But, it's Brandon Sanderson!! So I forged ahead, and am I glad. As I read, the story became more complex, the characters, more alive. Soon, I couldn't put it down, & now that it's over, I feel very, very full & satisfied. The simplistic writibg at the beginning was a metaphor for Tress, who starts the story as a simple girl. As she grows, as her life expands, so does the writing. So, it's more that just the story. It's the story structure that emulates the characters' growth. This is an amazing story, excellently written.",

                "reviewText": "While the rest of us were gaining weight and getting depressed during the Covid-19 lockdown, Brandon Sanderson was doing what he does best: churning out books.And the first of these four surprise books is \u201cTress of the Emerald Sea,\u201d a Cosmere novel that mingles quirky fairy-tale quests for a true love with the rough\u2019n\u2019tumble life of a pirate. Sanderson gives us a extraordinarily ordinary heroine who stumbles and triumphs on her quest, along with a talking rat, seas of colorful spores, and the occasional zombie doctor.Tress is a seemingly ordinary girl on a small rocky island in the green spore sea \u2013 she collects teacups, washes windows, loves her family, and regularly meets with the local duke\u2019s son, Charlie. When the duke realizes that his son is in love with a window-washing girl, he whisks the boy off the island to marry a princess. When the duke returns, he\u2019s got a brand new heir with a new wife \u2013 and Charlie is nowhere to be seen. He\u2019s been sent off to the realm of the Sorceress in the Midnight Sea, which means he\u2019s effectively doomed.But Tress is determined to get him back, so she smuggles herself off the island\u2026 and finds herself the prisoner first of smugglers, and then a crew of pirates ruled by the bloodthirsty Captain Crow. She also acquires a talking rat friend, Huck, who becomes her best friend and ally, especially since he knows some things about the Sorceress. Though the situation isn\u2019t ideal, Tress believes the ship can get her to the Sorceress, and manages to work her way into the crew.But her plans are complicated when she becomes friends with several of the pirates, and learns some disturbing facts about Crow. How can a simple window-washer girl defeat a pirate captain, sail the deadly Crimson and Midnight Seas, escape a dragon and defeat the terrible Sorceress \u2013 all while learning the true nature of spores and aethers?\u201cTress of the Emerald Sea\u201d is one parts fairy tale, one part pirate adventure, and one part Cosmere story (especially since the narrator is none other than Hoid, who plays a pivotal role). And the world Sanderson conjures is a fascinating one, where twelve moons produce a steady downfall of spores that form whole seas that wooden ships can sail on. But, much like a mogwai, never expose them to water, or very bad things happen.Since Hoid is the one telling the tale, the entire story unfolds in a quirky, laid-back narrative style, reminiscent of William Goldman or a more modern fairy tale. It\u2019s arch, snarky and very omniscient third-person (Tress\u2019s hair is once described as an \u201celdritch horror\u201d bent on \u201cdisintegrating reality, seeking the lives of virgins, and demanding a sacrifice of a hundred bottles of expensive conditioner\u201d). The only major flaw, ironically, is that self-same snarky tone \u2013 it sometimes becomes kind of overbearing, especially during the more serious parts of the story, and sometimes it feels like Hoid is hijacking the story.It also has Sanderson\u2019s exceptional world-building, especially in the idea of the spores, which will immediately erupt into SOMETHING \u2013 air, vines, crystals \u2013 upon contact with water. And while Sanderson weaves in elements of the Cosmere, creating a more science-fiction-y world, there are elements of magic included in it, such as Huck. No, I will not explain what is up with the rat, only that not all is as it seems\u2026 as you\u2019d expect with a talking rat.Tress herself is an exceptional heroine \u2013 smart, resourceful, determined, good-hearted and practical, with a nimble brain and a love for collectible cups. Her relationship with Huck is very wholesome and sometimes heartwrenching, as are her friendships with other members of the crew \u2013 a seemingly-zombie doctor, an assistant cannonmaster who never successfully hits anything, a cheery deaf man with a writing board, and the deadly, nihilistic Captain Crow. There are also Dougs, but we don\u2019t care about them.\u201cTress of the Emerald Sea\u201d is a charming, well-paced story that is a little too suffused in Hoid for its own good. For those seeking a rollicking pirate adventure with some wild fantastical twists, this is a must-read.",

I've read this while my daughter was falling asleep three or four times, she isn't really paying attention to the words, but I think its a great book for her to hear anyways.The character of Tress is not some extraordinary person like most books. She says over and over that she's just a normal girl, that takes on the task of saving her love from a witch. If you read Sanderson's books regularly the references to Hoid are great, but if not it doesn't really take away from the book, cause he's just a quirky background character then.",

I enjoyed this - I felt like it did get slow at times with more \"technical\" explanations of the world and the way of things. I enjoyed the magic of the spore sea - not something I have ever read. And I did get sucked in after 1/3-1/2 and wanted to finish to find out what happened. Definitely recommend!",
