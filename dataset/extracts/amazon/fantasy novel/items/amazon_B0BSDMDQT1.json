His expertise on ancient history, skill in disarming traps, and ability to solve puzzles make him ideal for this role. Koji - Towering Warrior After more than a decade together as Murguard Soldiers, Koji is Tor's most trusted friend. While he stands seven feet tall and is as strong as an ox, he has a kind heart. Koji wears an enchanted gauntlet that replaced a hand lost in battle and wields a razor sharp hatchet. Borgli - Stone Shaper Exiled from his people, Borgli is a dwarf trapped in a human world. This fierce warrior wields an ancient, legendary hammer, and he possesses the innate ability to shape stone with his bare hands. Gruff at one moment, joking and brash the next, Borgli brings spirit and comical moments to his team. Quell - Ranger/Archer As the youngest and only female member, Quell rounds out the crew and provides a sense of balance. Raised by a master ranger, she is a skilled archer, tracker, and hunter, offering skills that the other team members lack. Her snark and sarcasm add humor and banter to the group dynamic.",

This book featuring adventures of notorious relic hunter Tor Ranseur has action, humor, battles, monsters, a bit of mystery and the start of bonds of friendship with a growing crew. Each character is unique and, while not yet fully developed as this is book 1, they are clearly typed. All of this makes it a fun read, especially the fun banter. The story is serious without taking itself too seriously. Jeff Kohanek is a great writer and delivers what he promises. I miss more of a deep emotional story experience, which is my preference in any book. The main character and the plot don't lend themselves to that, so it has the appropriate level just not as much as I enjoy. All the rest was great.",

                "reviewText": "Tor Ranseur's fame usually precedes him but call him what you like- relic hunter, dungeon crawler- he is always on the hunt to find long lost relics with his crew. When the daughter of a retired master ranger asks for his help to find her missing father, he wants nothing to do with the brash girl, until he learns that the man was looking for the long lost temple of the Dark Lord.Tor is the brains of the group armed with Claw he is an expert at traps, puzzles and ancient history. Koji is the muscle (though he is a softy at heart), Borgli the dwarf and stone shaper is the newest addition to the crew. But now Quell, the female ranger, joins to find her father and this unlikely crew struggles to get along. When death is just a step away, the crew must learn to get along and play to their own strengths while trusting each other.This was a fun, funny and fast paced story that had old school fantasy vibes without all the unnecessary exposition. Each character had their own quirks and I loved each one of them for what they brought to the story and how they balanced each other. It was really fun exploring the world with this crew and I just flew through this book.",

                "reviewText": "What should be an average 3 star fantasy suffers due to the authors decision to pointlessly add a trans/homo/whatever scene early in the story, a character that likes sheep far far far more than is natural, and regular references to ... male anatomy - its current status on a character, its absence from certain statues, threats of damage or amputation to it etc.Do we need to know this? No we absolutely don't, so it's unclear why the author focuses so much attention on such things.All that aside, the tale is decent and reminiscent of a D&D or similar adventure. There's also hints of things and a number of unexplained things, though it's unclear whether this is intentional or oversight. Is the benefactor human, or something more like ascended? Is, or was, the Dark Lord human? He's treated as an evil deity, but the human leaders of the assorted 'kingdoms' appear to be prayed to and worshipped as well Does this empower them somehow, or am I drawing false parallels and conclusions?",
