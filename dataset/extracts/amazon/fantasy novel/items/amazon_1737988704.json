        "description": "A brand-new, full-color graphic novel series for animal fantasy fans that delivers a daring adventure and a mysterious threat that has animals-prey and predator alike-disappearing. An orphaned white wolf cub exiled from her pack.A lone snow leopard searching for her missing cub.A bumbling wild cat who can't hold a tune. In the midst of a brutal winter in the unforgiving Snowlands, famine plague the wolf pack. As the pack goes hungry, blame falls on Feba, an orphaned wolf cub whose white fur many elders believe is a bad omen. When the wolf pack's cubs vanish into thin air, the pack leaders vote to banish Feba, and perhaps worse. She escapes her fate and runs off into the icy wilderness of the Snowlands. Lost in the treacherous mountains, Feba stumbles upon Usha, a cold and unfriendly snow leopard mother on a personal quest. While Usha wants nothing more than to continue her journey alone, she grudgingly allows Feba and a skittish young mountain cat, Batu, to follow her. With a snowy trail full of deadly obstacles ahead, the unlikely trio sets out to find the Seeress, a magical being Usha hopes can find her missing son. Each step takes Usha, Feba, and Batu deeper into danger where they encounter other creatures-some helpful, some deceitful-and uncover a widespread peril in the mountains, the fate of the missing cubs, and what having a family truly means. Snowlands is an epic tale of survival and friendship full of wild creatures, magical mysteries, and dangerous terrain perfect for middle-grade fans of Erin Hunter's Braveland and Warriors series. \"Meroz's background as an animator shines through in this graphic novel's page-turning action sequences, and artist Fogel and colorist Comodo use their considerable skills to turn desolate landscapes into rich, engrossing images. The numerous adversaries that the main trio of characters encounters are truly sinister, and they're just the right amount of scary for middle-grade readers... Meroz successfully delivers intriguing characters and necessary worldbuilding for a series that promises to be as likable as its lead character. Sumptuous visuals and intriguing ideas will leave readers hungry for more time in the Snowlands.\" -Kirkus Reviews Read more",

                "reviewText": "Snowlands: A Blood Moon (Book One) by Morr Meroz is a fantastic fantasy graphic novel for young readers. Feba, a young wolf cub, has been banished from her pack because her white coat is viewed as a bad omen. To make matters worse, the sheep have vanished and now members of the pack are vanishing as well. Alone in the wilderness, she befriends a wild cat and a snow leopard. The three of them each have their own missions, but they must come together if they are going to solve the mysteries they are surrounded by.The images and the characters are perfect for kids who are near the end of elementary school through middle school. I read this with my daughter, who is 9, and she really liked it. She was drawn to the characters because she liked the types of animals that were chosen, and she really wanted to know what was going to happen next because the story was engaging. This is probably too much for a read aloud with younger kids, and older ones may find it too childish, but fourth and fifth grade is probably a great target age for this.",

This is definitely a challenging tale with themes of survival and friendship. While overall a pretty benign read, there are elements of violence that may not be suitable for younger children.

His characters are all unique and compelling, from the fierce, brave Feba to other seductive Snowlands characters. Snowlands a thrilling and satisfying read with beautiful illustrations and people who feel real and believable.Snowlands is an impressive achievement. In this first installment, Morr Meroz has created a fascinating and engrossing world, and I can't wait to see what he does with the story in future books. The Kindle version is difficult to read because of the small print, but if you're looking for an exciting, thought-provoking read with well-developed characters and a captivating plot, then Snowlands: A Blood Moon (Book One) is the perfect choice.",

I haven't read the entire book as I want it in new condition for my nephew but I looked through most of it. The illustrations are great. The story is adventurous and has plenty of characters to meet. There is some violence so I would keep that in mind for younger kids. Overall a great graphic novel for 4th grade and up depending on the reader.",
