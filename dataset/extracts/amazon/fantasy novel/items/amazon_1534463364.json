                "reviewText": "Like many readers, I am anxiously awaiting the release of the latest KOTLC book. As an avid fan, I purchased the graphic novel to help lessen the wait.I did not realize that the graphic novel only covered the first half of the Keeper of the Lost Cities book until I received it. I was let down to learn this. Because of the book being split up, I also think the ending is a bit disappointing as it seems to end a little abruptly.I enjoyed the graphics and felt the illustrator did a good job bringing the magic of the lost cities to light. However, I did feel that Fitz was frumpy looking and did not seem to be as cute as he is made out to be. I am glad that I had read the series first so that I could have my own imaginings of how things look versus the graphic novel (I didn\u2019t imagine the leapmaster to look like a giant disco ball).I was planning on introducing my children to the series with this graphic novel, however I think I will just wait a couple of years and have them read the regular novels instead.If you are a Keeper of the Lost Cities fan already, you will likely enjoy the book but it surely doesn\u2019t add anything to the story.",

                "reviewText": "Sophie Foster, a 12-year-old girl, has always felt like she doesn't belong. She is extraordinary, able to read people's minds, and possesses exceptional intelligence. One day, while on a field trip, Sophie meets a boy named Fitz, who leads her to the realization that she is an elf. This discovery forces her to leave her former life behind and enter a new world. How will Sophie adjust to these significant changes in her life?What a thrilling graphic novel that will leave you in your seat. Although I have yet to read the first book, this adaptation (of the first part of book one) was enough to keep me engaged. The characters are so vibrant and full of powers that you can't help but get sucked into their world. The art style is breathtaking, and the plot is well-crafted, full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the end. I like the bonus pages on how to draw your favorite Keeper characters at the end.Sophie, the protagonist, is an intelligent and resourceful person who always puts others before herself. She is a true hero, and you can't help but root for her throughout the book. On the other hand, Fitz is a good character, but we don't see much of him until later in the story. Sophie's new friends are also impressive, and their dynamic adds another layer of excitement to the plot.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and fantasy. It's a thrilling ride that you won't want to miss!Happy Reading, Paige \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\udcdaThank you to the publisher for sharing this excellent graphic novel with me, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.",

But while reading it the graphics felt more and more natural and acurate. Although I dont like the design for Fitz.Overall worth buying even for a german reader like me. Plus the shipping was relativly fast for a product sent from the US.",
