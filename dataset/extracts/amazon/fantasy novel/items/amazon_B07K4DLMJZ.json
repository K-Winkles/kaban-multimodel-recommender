                "reviewText": "Joanne is renting a house for the summer to study bird nests. Joanne studies bird ecology and conservation. Joanne is a cancer survivor. Before she began her research in the woods she slept with Tanner a guy whom she did research with. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer he became a man she no longer wanted or needed in her life. The realization that without breasts and a uterus she wasn\u2019t the woman for him. When a young girl wandered onto the property claiming to be from the stars she grew curious about her life.\u2026Joanne\u2019s world became about finding Ursa\u2019s home and learning more about where she came from. Along the way they bonded together accepting each other\u2019s pasts. Joanne\u2019s neighbor was united with them linking them together forming a friendship that the girl needed. Sometimes people can\u2019t choose their family but they can choose who they want to be friends with. Sometimes these friendships become more important.\u2026Glendy Vanderah writes a brilliant enchanting story about a young girl named Ursa who meets a bird ecologist living in the woods. It\u2019s a magnificent story written beautifully well. I was encapsulated by her writing voice. Ursa was a wonderful nine year old who stole the show. I am looking forward to reading more books by Glendy Vanderah she has a writing style that I can immerse myself in.\u2026Lauren Ezzo was the solo female narrator who absolutely made this story come to life. Her voice acting skills sold me on Ursa. I\u2019m definitely going to look into buying more audiobooks performed by Lauren Ezzo.",

                "reviewText": "Jo Teale, research scientist and PhD candidate, is broken both physical and mentally, and she throws herself into her work studying bird nesting sites in rural Illinois to prove she isn\u2019t. When a battered child shows up claiming to be from the planet Hetrayeh in the Pinwheel Galaxy and says she\u2019ll return home after witnessing five miracles, Jo doesn\u2019t believe her. Neither does Gabe Nash, the multilayered \u201cEgg Man,\u201d who owns the farm adjacent to the property Jo is renting for the summer and who is every bit as broken as she is.This novel was the January pick for my book club, and I wasn't happy about it. I'd read reviews, and the book sounded a bit too science fiction-ish for me. In fact, I started reading it New Years Day to be sure I'd finish before our meeting the middle of the month.I couldn't have been more wrong. After a few pages, I decided its genre was magical realism (my favorite), and I plowed right through it. I finished it in three days, which, if the child, Ursa, had witnessed, would've counted for one of her five miracles.The people in this book seem very real, and their past is doled out piece by piece as they gradually get to know each other. The relationship between Jo and Gabe is tentative and messy but strong, and their love for Ursa leads them to make some bad decisions because they believe doing the \"right\" thing would be even worse for her. The supporting characters have a few secrets of their own--and what a bombshell one of them is! The book is bursting with dialogue, which I loved. My only complaint is the ending. The author did her best to make it suspenseful, but it wasn't. It also left a few ends looser than I would've liked.",

                "reviewText": "\"Where the Forest Meets the Stars\" by Glendy Vanderah is a captivating tale that seamlessly weaves together themes of grief, healing, and the magic of connection. From the very first page, I was drawn into a world where the ordinary and the extraordinary collide.The story revolves around Jo Teale, an ornithologist who is grieving the loss of her mother to cancer, and Ursa, a mysterious young girl who claims to be an alien on a mission to witness five miracles. Their unlikely friendship forms the heart of the narrative, and it's impossible not to become emotionally invested in their journey.Vanderah's writing is nothing short of exquisite. Her descriptions of nature are vivid and poetic, creating a rich backdrop for the story. The characters are beautifully developed, each harboring their own wounds and secrets, and their growth throughout the novel is both moving and believable.As the story unfolds, it explores the themes of love, loss, and the healing power of human connection. It also delves into the profound idea of finding wonder and miracles in the most unexpected places. Vanderah's storytelling skillfully tugs at the heartstrings, leaving you with a sense of hope and renewal by the end.\"Where the Forest Meets the Stars\" is a literary gem that will resonate with readers who appreciate stories that are both heartwarming and thought-provoking.
