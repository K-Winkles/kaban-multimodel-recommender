Combined with gorgeous color work and really unique and memorable characters, the magic in this style is stunning. While I'm sure Xu could draw a phenomenal contemporary graphic novel, there's something about the line work that lends itself to fantasy. At the heart of Tidesong is the way we always think we can handle more than we can.When we are convinced we're all grown up. However Sophie's story is one of family and mistakes. Of letting the past and our guilt twist our present. Sophie feels like she's trying to live up to the pressure she puts on herself to be powerful now. To feel like everything is happening right now. How can anyone live under the weight of our own harsh standards? We can be so determined not to bend under pressure, when all we need is a little flexibility.",

                "reviewText": "Sophie is a young witch with a lot of pressure on her. Her grandmother and mother want her to attend The Royal Magic Academy, the best place to study magic. Even though her magic isn't the best. So she finds herself with relatives she's never even met, relatives who seem more keen on teaching her to do chores than magic. When Sophie tries magic on her own things go terribly wrong. She accidentally entangles her magic with a water dragon's magic, trapping him in his human form.With Lir's and her magic intertwined Sophie finally seems to be getting the hang of magic and just in time her entrance exams, but things aren't all sunshine and roses especially when they realize that the water dragon isn't just any water dragon. Can Sophie and Lir work together in untangle their magic all while proving themselves? And what will they learn as they do?This was such an adorable graphic novel. The story reminded me of a mix of Luca and Raya and the Last Dragon, so if you like those vibes I'd definitely give this one a go. The magic in this book was more subtle. It sorta relies heavier on the element of water to be able to tap into their magic. Also I got some major Water-bender vibes from the pictures. I also feel like the family dynamics were well done even for the short length of this book. Overall this is a super read perfect if you want something fast or more light-hearted to read in between books.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for sending me an earc copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A magical book with brilliant (& adorable!) illustrations. Must-have for graphic novel collections.",
                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been a fan of Wendy Xu\u2019s art since I saw it one year at Small Press Expo (SPX), a mini comics conference held in the DC area each year. I was excited to pick up Wendy\u2019s middle grade graphic novel Tidesong for the art, of course, but I was also intrigued by the incorporation of water dragons, a gorgeous color palette, and a Studio Ghibli-esque feel. Tidesong did not disappoint \u2013 it\u2019s a charming fantasy adventure with lots of heart.Sophie is descended from a long line of witches who can control the winds and the tides, and she is determined to make her family proud, but the pressure to perform is causing some problems. First, learning the family magic is tough, and her auntie Lan is hard on her. Second, when she goes rogue and tries it on her own, she traps young dragon Lir out of his dragon form and memories. Figuring out how to untangle the mess she\u2019s created will take patience, a change of heart, talking it out, and teamwork.Gosh, this book was cute! It also had solid messages and themes: dealing with family expectations (meeting them, bucking them, going your own way and owning your mistakes!), wanting to learn things right away and having to adapt and slow down when it isn\u2019t easy, and how to respond in a healthy way to intrusive negative thoughts. Sophie is young, and while she thinks she\u2019s ready for life\u2019s challenges, she figures out pretty quickly that she still has quite a way to go. Her aunties Lan and Sage and family friend Eugenia make for by turns stern and supportive mentors, and the family chickens are an effective spy network. If that last phrase made you chuckle, this might be the book for you! It\u2019s got humor and heart, and while the plot is fairly simplistic (no huge plot twists here!), it is worth the read.Of course, I mentioned dragons, and I haven\u2019t gotten around to those yet! The first few pages of the book are a retelling of the legend of how the Wu witches got their power (wouldn\u2019t you know, they are descended from a dragon who fell in love with a fisherman!), and this inclusion at the start of the story sets the stage for a fairy tale- and mythology-tinged tale. The illustrations tell most of the story here \u2013 there\u2019s no extended exposition about how the magic in Sophie\u2019s world works, no questions about different magical creatures \u2013 they just are, and they are darn cute. Tiny, fluffy chickens with teeth, a mini dragon, and a kappa all steal the show at various points as insanely adorable sidekicks. This was what felt the most like a Ghibli film to me: strange and cute sea and land creatures bobbling about on each page.Let\u2019s talk about that art style! Xu is well-known for her previous graphic novel Mooncakes, and you can expect the same art style in Tidesong, both a bit more refined and a bit more open-feeling, if that makes sense. The cool color palette is appropriate for the setting (the sea! the seaside! an island village!) and the variation in panel sizes, shapes, and bleed on some spreads is evocative of whatever is happening in the story. This is a graphic novel that leans more heavily on imagery than on text, and it is 100% charming.In all, Tidesong is a magical graphic novel with brilliant (and adorable!) illustrations. A must-have for middle grade graphic novel collections.Recommended for: fans of the animated film Ponyo and Molly Knox Ostertag\u2019s The Witch Boy, and readers ages 7 and up.",
