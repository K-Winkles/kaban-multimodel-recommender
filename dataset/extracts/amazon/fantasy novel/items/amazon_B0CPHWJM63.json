Conspiracies. Guns. Blades. Violence. Lots of violence involving guns and blades, well laid out so you can 'see' it in your head as you read...and it's set in Louisiana - which is as good as being set in North Florida or Texas cause that means at some point you're going to read something Redneck in it (and there it was ... basically a homage to Six Gun Territory...with a Lich).So I read it and, end of the book, I was Hooked.Great story, great writing.Can't wait to read the next one!",

The book sucked me in and then I became a bit disinterested about 1/3rd the way through and considered moving on to another book, but I stuck with it and before I knew it I was sucked in and loving it again. The universe is interesting and well built, the ending was good. I look forward to the next novel.",
