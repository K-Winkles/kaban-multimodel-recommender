                "reviewText": "Fine Print; Or, How a Divine Contract May Not Be the Best Cure For a Broken Heart is a new graphic novel series from Stjepan \u0160eji\u0107, the author/artist of Sunstone, and is even more steamy and erotic than the latter title. As is typical of \u0160eji\u0107's work, the art is magnificent, the colors are dynamic and eye-catching, the characters are engaging, the facial expressions are superb, and even the smuttiest scenes serve a purpose in the overall story.The one notable flaw is that we don't get enough of that story.The premise for the overall series is pretty simple: a model named Lauren Thomas is granted a magical contract that would summon the greatest of all cubi (gods of desire) to fulfill her every sexual need; unfortunately, the title of \"greatest\" is currently a contested one, so Lauren gets both the finalists and must judge for herself which of them is the winner. What is not at all simple is all the backstory and worldbuilding that has to go into such a premise. And so \u0160eji\u0107 spends so much of volume 1 showing us who and what the cubi are, why the contracts exist and why they're so important, how Lauren's love life has gone so wrong that she would try such a contract in the first place, and what the stakes are for everybody involved, that the actual premise itself that I outlined above doesn't get fully set up. Instead, we're left with a sort of awkward cliffhanger to be taken up next issue, like when the two-hour pilot of a TV series would get split up into two one-hour episodes for the reruns. Which leaves the book gorgeous, intriguing, and sexy as anything, but not all that satisfying narratively. That said, I still can't wait for volume 2.",

Aber inhaltlich, erz\u00e4hlerisch und k\u00fcnstlerisch ein gro\u00dfartiges Werk, dass lose in der gleichen Welt angesiedelt ist.Durch die unheimlich gute Erz\u00e4hlweise und die epischen Bilder vergisst man beim lesen zwischenzeitlich fast, dass es sich um eine Geschichte mit viel Erotik handelt.Ich freue mich definitiv schon auf den zweiten Band.",
