                "reviewText": "\"I realize Hell is empty, and the Devil is here.\"i saw that epilogue coming BUT THE MURDERER??? i never wouldve guessed that person\ud83d\udc80 curse this cliffhanger because i dont want to wait until next year for book 2\ud83d\ude2d im in desperate need of more c\u00e9lie and michal\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udef6but guys shelby has renewed my faith in her books again!! after the mess of G&M i originally wasnt interested in TSV but i was convinced AND SO GLAD I DID BECAUSE IT MADE ME REMEMBER WHY I LOVE SHELBY'S BOOKS SO MUCH??? this wasnt just so fun but also heartbreaking, funny and gave me the \"i need more asap\" feeling. (i may or may not have neglected school life for this book oops)I smile--because I know, in this moment, my strength has never been like the others'. I am not cunning or fearless like Lou, nor am I strategic or disciplined like the Chasseurs. No. I am C\u00e9lie Tremblay, Bride of Death, and my strength has always and will always be in my loved ones. My friends.c\u00e9lie's story is one i never imagined we'd see but im so so happy that shelby decided to write it because she deserved her own story!! from her acknowledgements: I still remember sitting down to write Gods & Monsters and hesitating when you asked, \u201cWhat about C\u00e9lie?\u201d Though I\u2019m ashamed to admit it, I\u2019d already dismissed her as the jealous ex-girlfriend. You challenged me to see her differently\u2014as a flawed character, yes, but also as a sheltered, grief-stricken young woman with a spine of steel truly this made me tear up\ud83e\udd7a i also never really thought twice abt her in S&D trilogy but oh if there's anything that TSV has done, it's made her one of my favourite MCs ive read abt this year (and maybe even ever??). her strength is in her love for others and clich\u00e9 as that may sound i love that her optimism in situations and trying to see the best in others!! she's actually too pure.\"Perhaps the C\u00e9lie you know never existed. Have you ever considered that? It can happen without us even realizing--we fall in love with an idea instead of a person. We give each other pieces of ourselves but never the whole thing, and without the whole thing, how can we ever truly know a person.\"no because when c\u00e9lie spoke of this... it hit HARD. like it really takes so much courage and strength to give all your pieces to someone because... what if they dont accept every part of you?? there's always that small possibility and to have to deal with the possible pain and heart break that would come with it?? so its safer to just not give someone all of you and avoid that chance of rejection\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd79which brings me to MICHAL AKA NEW LOVE OF MY LIFE!! their start was truly an ACTUAL enemies to lovers (and actually to the lovers parts\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40). he sees all of c\u00e9lie and doesn't shy away in disgust or pity from any of it. he's so sweet, tender, funny, and charming to c\u00e9lie GAHHH MY HEART\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udef6 c\u00e9lie said it herself His smiles fades with it, returning him instantly to the cool and collected Michal I've always known. My muscles go weak with relief. I've witnessed his wrath, his grace, his power, and I've survived them all, but his charm? I don't think anyone can survive that. SPEAKING FACTS i swooned so many times like michal acting ruthless?? can totally handle that BUT HIM BEING SO CHARMING AND SWEET??? IM WEAK and so in love with my vampire king. when c\u00e9lie asked what he feared and michal's response was nothing but philophobia oh i just\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0 IM IN LOVE WITH THEM YOUR HONOR i need more michalc\u00e9lie\ud83e\udd79and may i just express my love for their conversations as well?? so many times i laughed like truly c\u00e9lie is so funny\ud83d\ude2d\u201cWe aren\u2019t exactly being inconspicuous as it is, and\u201d\u2014I lower my voice\u2014\u201cand couldn\u2019t you just compel a courtesan to tell us where to go?\u201d\u201cDoest my ears deceive me, or did the holier-than-thou Mademoiselle C\u00e9lie Tremblay just suggest we take away free will?\u201d He casts me a sidelong glance. \u201cI had no idea you were so wicked, pet. How delightful.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mean we should compel her,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cI\u2019m merely asking, hypothetically, what would happen if we did.\u201d\u201cHypothetically,\u201d he repeats, his voice dry.\u201cOf course. I would never actually suggest we force someone to do something against their will. I\u2019m not\u201d\u2014I cast about for the right word, failing to find it\u2014\u201cI\u2019m not evil.\u201d\u201cNo, no. Just hypothetically evil.\u201d He rolls his eyes again as I sputter indignantly.michal's response to celie helppp they had me dying actually these two\ud83e\udef6 also!! i adore the new characters we got to meet !! odessa, dimitri, d'artagnan, mila and monsieur marc <33 my favs were definitely mila and odessa i love those two queens. and i really want to see more odessa & c\u00e9lie moments because the potential for their friendship blooming more!! always saying yes to that.it was so fun seeing the old gang from S&D together also (not jean luc though, he can respectfully go to hell\ud83e\udd29. THAT ONE SCENE WITH LOU, COCO, AND C\u00c9LIE??? IT WAS EVERYTHING\ud83e\udd79 the pride and love they hold dear towards c\u00e9lie makes my heart full of so much happinessi am so beyond excited for book 2 and truly cannot wait to see where things head, i can already see book 2 being very character driven and of course more romance\ud83e\udd2d michal and c\u00e9lie are my newest obsession and you're telling me i'll have to wait a year to see more of them??? i will do anything to get my hands on book 2",

It fits her character, but jesus, running into so many obvious traps. She is a damn mess and it makes sense but dang.",

When does book two come out?!?!?!Ok, the first few chapters were rather slow and it took me till about chapter 5 to get into the story. I think, however, had I read the serpent and dove series first I would have been hooked from page one. There were a lot of characters- that obviously had a backstory - which I didn\u2019t read so I was a little confused and almost gave up. But I so glad I didn\u2019t. Once the story picked up I was hooked and binged read this in one sitting.You can read this book without reading serpent and dove - but man, I wish I had read serpent and dove first so I could understand all the Easter eggs and references.I love the magical world and the clash between the church and creatures. And the love interest - beautiful and can\u2019t wait to see where it goes.4.5 stars",

However, even without prior knowledge this book is not unreadable, very far from it in fact.Do I think it will stand the test of time as high fantasy, similar to how Dune and Lord of the Rings have? Absolutely not. Do I think this was a highly exciting read that kept me hooked and wanting more page after page, absolutely yes.",
