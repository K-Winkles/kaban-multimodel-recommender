                "reviewText": "Overall Score: 4/5\u2728Character Development: 4/5Plot: 4/5Ease of Reading: 3/5Overall Enjoyment: 5/5I think I\u2019ve found one of my new favorite authors. After reading A Study in Drowning, I knew it would become easily one of my most loved books of all time and I had to pick up another book by Ava.Intensely descriptive and full of imagery, Ava\u2019s writing continues to astound me. Although vastly different from the more gothic, ethereal vibes of ASID, Juniper & Thorn was equally provoking and fully engrossed me in the story. Ava Reid\u2019s beautiful prose felt oddly out of place in this horror based on the Germanic fairytale The Juniper Tree, but it also felt like it fit perfectly into the fantastical world of communistic Oblya.Marlinchen is the youngest, and plainest, of three otherwise beautiful witch daughters. She cannot create, or summon, or heal, but she can find a person\u2019s cause of illness through touch. She is a good daughter, an obedient one, and her father can count on her to remain dutiful in all things.Until Marlinchen and her sisters go to the Oblyan ballet against their father\u2019s orders, and she becomes enamored with the ballet\u2019s principle dancer. Things are not always as they seem, and Marlinchen must discover what is truth and what is not, and whether she has the strength to escape that which binds her.This darkly whimsical tale stippled with gore, vengeance, and the awakening of the monster within was surprising and had me on the edge of my seat in some moments, and in others vastly entranced just by the themes woven inside. There were some times that the pacing felt a bit slow, but I sat back and enjoyed the ride and overall loved this book!",

                "reviewText": "3.5 starsI enjoyed this but it was much darker than I was expecting it to be. There\u2019s a lot of content that could be triggering for readers such as physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. There\u2019s also brief mentions of pedophilia and rape. The main character has an eating disorder and we see her throw up after most meals. Her eating disorder is complex though and is tied to the abuse she faces from her father and the guilt she feels over her actions.The strongest aspect of this story is the romance between the two main characters. It is quite intense and touching. Apart from the romance, it felt like the traumas of the characters were the dominating aspect of the story. Overall, the amount of triggering content in this made it hard for me to fully enjoy but there were some elements that I liked. Ava Reid writes gorgeous prose and I will definitely read her next book.",

It was far and away, without question my favorite read in YEARS.Swept away into what feels like a dark, mysterious fairytale full of poetic melancholy, I didn\u2019t want it to ever end and kept stalling reading the last 10% of the book because the thought of it being over was just unacceptable. It is both heartbreakingly sad yet also somehow feels impossibly like home. One of those stories that seems to be simultaneously seeping into and out of my heart, my bones, my soul\u2026speaking to my inner despair, calling to all the dark shadowed parts of myself in a way that made me feel seen and less alone in the world.I read and enjoy many different genres and types of stories but in the end what I want from a book is to feel *something*\u2026and this story absolutely made me FEEL, all the way to the very core essence of my being. It\u2019s a stunning work of art and an absolute must-read for anyone who likes dark, gothic horror, I cannot recommend it enough!I received a copy of this book from the publisher.

                "reviewText": "As someone who knows the original story this book is based on (The Juniper Tree) and considers it one of my favorite Grimm Faerie tales, I knew going in this book was going to be dark. The original story features abuse, cannibalism, death, and of course a lot of trauma that comes with dealing with the aforementioned things.This was also my first experience with Reid as an author. And I will say... i enjoy her work and will be looking for her books in the future. (I already have a copy of \"Wolf and Woodsman\" ready to go.I know this book has gotten some flack for being too dark, but at the same time, I went in with the mindset it was going to be that way. (Like I said, I read the original tale and tempered my expectations accordingly)If it's something that requires a trigger warning... It's in here. But the way these subjects are handled is something I think is done with tact. Very rarely does it feel like such things were shoehorned in to shock the reader or to make the story more edgy. Abuse and trauma shapes the characters, and they all react in their own ways to it, some with less healthy coping mechanisms than others (Sevas drinks, Marlinchen rebels in her own ways, via an eating disorder, and her sisters turn their anger onto her because she won't fight back) It comes to form a tale about regaining power and leaving the toxic environment that is keeping someone in a toxic cycle of abuse.There are a few things to tie it back to Faerie tales, such as insta love (But I think it's more trauma bonding) and the wicked sisters and father, who seem a little flat. And of course an abundance of monsters who both help and terrify the characters.That being said, I do feel like there's a bit too much purple prose and some repeated phrases, but again, faerie tale retelling, kind of par for the course.Overall, I gave it a 4/5.",
