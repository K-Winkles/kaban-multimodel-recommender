                "reviewText": "The story continues to be good. However this whole thing with the affection building between Ariane and Arc is not as impressive. Sure the guys had made a few mistakes here and there, but he has been loyal, strong and trustworthy. He protects and runs head first into a fight to keep others safe. But Ariane is the type of woman who can't let a man bask in his accomplishments and efforts. She goes out of her way to disrespect and demoralize Arc on a regular basis whenever he feels minutely joyful. It's depressing. She would not be the type of woman worth falling for. The rest of the storyline is interesting though and learning more about Arc's curse is fun.",

The volume is mostly about character development with a little on the rest of the world through side stories on by now familiar nobility (and merchant). If you like the previous parts, you like this one even though the main story is a bit more isolated from the world and potentially leaves us with more questions than answers.",

                "reviewText": "You might agree that text offers the possibility to include intangible and non-visual details, and thus stemming from one's own understanding of what is possible allows a story to seem more real to the reader's mind than the rapid fire pace of anime and manga visuals alone could do. While this story could use a little more art to keep up with the characters and scenes, the reading feels like a description of each frame-scene from an anime and thus makes it easier to understand certain inferred meanings, like the relationship and potential relationship of the two most main characters. Too many novels rely on obscure colloquialisms on explicit detail, so this is a big plus to any anime fans. Some light novels take advantage of the text-advantage to add too much detail to keep the pace of the story, thus this simpler rhythm is welcome.",
