                "reviewText": "I really enjoyed this book. Dubbed a Practical Magic meets Gilmore Girls book, and it absolutely lives up to that. While you don't get a witty Lorelei character we do get a cozy town and an eccentrically loving family dynamic.This book cover a lot of ground in 322 pages. While I didn't go into expecting a cozy witchy story it packed much more of an emotional punch than I expected.I really related with Sadie. Right or wrong I can admit to behaving like her in that age range. I absolutely adored Gigi and her \"piss ant\" calling ways.The author did an amazing job creating detailed imagery with the herbs and oils and recepies but then sped through the ending . The book ended well, but rushed. I would have loved a bit more.",

                "reviewText": "I pre-ordered this book after seeing it hyped so much on social media and I was so excited to read it. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily describe it as \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d although I think it got that reputation from the small town setting and the grandmother, Gigi, whose dialogue reads like Babette. I would say that it is a nice, simple, cozy fall read for a rainy day. There was nothing very special about this book for me, although there were elements that I did enjoy:Pros:\u2022 The magic - I liked that with each person\u2019s magic comes a curse and that everyone\u2019s magic is different.\u2022 The recipes at the end of each chapter. Very cute and unexpected.\u2022 I thought the romance ending between Sadie and Jake, while predictable, was decent. I like a good second chance romance.\u2022 Gigi\u2019s rules were so cute- I would have loved a master list somewhere in the book to look at them all.Cons:\u2022 I was not expecting the religious aspect. It was odd and forced in my opinion- almost bordering on preachy. Definitely not for me, but everyone is different.\u2022 The main character Sadie was completely unlikeable. She had no real believable growth and no real lessons were learned.\u2022 I understand the ending was probably left open for possible sequels, but the ending was lackluster and dissatisfying.\u2022 The first 1/3 of the book was slow and disorganized. It could have done with a lot of editing. But the story and action did pick up.\u2022 The romance was extremely predictable. Between the main characters and others. Which is fine, but there are zero surprises. Absolutely nothing to keep anyone guessing.Honestly, the story is cute. There are some very glaring technical problems with this novel, but if you can get passed that, it\u2019s fine. For me personally, I didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as I anticipated I would. However, I would still recommend this book to people who are looking for a book to get them in to the fall/October spirit.",

Can\u2019t wait to try some of them. The plot is good, character\u2019s descriptions were excellent. This was a book I had to put down due to work obligations, but was able to pick right back up in the storyline. Would highly recommended for folks who are wanting a good read.

                "reviewText": "This book is a light and enjoyable story of magic, heartbreak, romance, and recipes. I enjoyed it. It was a welcome respite for taking a break from a very serious and depressing book filled with starvation, suffering and poverty. It was fun that each member of the family had a different type of magic. And that each type of magic was offset by a curse that was intended to make some sort of karmic balance. This book will not change your life, it would not be a book group book for my group, and it did not make me a better person, but not every book needs to. It was enough for it to be distracting and entertaining even if I am unlikely to remember much about it. The romance is fairly chaste, the language is fairly mild, and there is no gory violence. Dramatic tension is provided by the need to defeat a curse before the expiration of a time deadline and some romantic complications.",
