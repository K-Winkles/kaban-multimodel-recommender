Each free verse poem is tightly composed, leading into the next for a poignant and richly layered narrative. The story builds softly and subtly to a perfect, bittersweet ending. Fans of Jacqueline Woodson won\u2019t be able to put this one down.\"\u2015School Library Journal, starred review\"McBride artfully weaves Black Southern Hoodoo traditions with those of the Navajo/Din\u00e9 people, creating a beautiful and cross-cultural reverence for the earth, its inhabitants, and our ancestors. ... Written in verse, this novel is hauntingly romantic, refusing to be rushed or put down without deep contemplation of what it means to accept the tragedies of our lives and to reckon with the ways we metamorphosize as a result of them.\" \u2015Booklist, starred review\"If you think you know where this story is going, think again.

McBride writes Moth\u2019s narration in spare, wistful free verse that reads like Francesca Lia Block in poetry or a fragile, emotional E. E. Cummings; Moth\u2019s pain at being \u201cthe guilty girl who lived\u201d is keen and haunting, and the frequent evocation of her grandfather, a spiritual rootworker, adds a supernatural flavor. ... Readers may not see the poignant final twist coming, but it\u2019s a satisfying climactic development that will leave them dabbing their eyes and turning to their own art in hope and gratitude.\" \u2015Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books (BCCB)\"Me (Moth) holds you like a gentle haint, pulling you in and out of song, and dance, and dreams until you are not sure where reality ends and memory begins. Amber McBride in her young adult debut has written a marvelous novel in verse full of ancestor wisdom and love that traverses crossroads that we must navigate to live.\"\u2015Joanne V.

The poems are incredibly beautiful.This story combines Hoodoo and indigenous spirituality, which I found interesting.Moth lost her family in an accident and has stopped dancing. She lives with her aunt but feels invisible in her new home and at her new high school until she meets Sani - a boy who is struggling to live in his own skin.Their road trip will change everything they thought they knew.When I finished this book, I decided to read it again in order to understand their journey better. This is a hauntingly beautiful story.\u201cGrandfather used to say, We light candles because they are lighthouses for the spirits of our ancestors to come sit with us.We give offerings out of respect.But what of other light? Like a sea turtle moving toward spotlit pavement instead of the moon-rippled sea.Who will answer for the sin of it being easy to get lost when so many orbs mirage the illusion of brightness?\u201d (20).The cover art is incredible and this book won the Corretta Scott King award. If you want a touching yet haunting story of grief, you may enjoy this book. Ages 13 and up.",

It was so beautiful though-- the poetry was lyrical and it dances in your mind for a long time afterwards. I think what really worked for me was the amazing use of white space and using poetry to tell a story. This book would not have worked in prose in my opinion. It literally HAD to be told like this.When I attended the Virginia Book Festival last year, McBride did mention that her editor(?) wanted her to turn it into a verse novel and that was the greatest decision to make. I just ordered her other novel, \"We Are All So Good At Smiling\". Such talent!",

Lyrical, haunting and wise, Me (Moth) is full of twists not only of the plot, but of the heart and mind, and left me deeply moved.And like its two characters Moth and Sani, Me Moth does not fit easily into typical categories.I had never read a novel in verse before, and thought maybe this would make the story harder to follow. But Amber McBride's literary artistry was not only a delight to savor, but her story flowed with flawless clarity. I felt many chapter verses could stand alone as elegant poems.Me Moth is a meaningful, magnificent story, and a treat for the soul. Highly recommended.",
