I read all three books in 3 days (I didn't want to put them down!) then the other 2 in the series (Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom) right after.Shadow and Bone.... I think what was good for me was to see the Netflix show first. I didn't watch the entire series, but it gave me enough to better visualize the Characters in the book. I loved them all... I thought they each brought something to the story. I am very much a Villian fan, so The Darkling was my absolute favorite. I couldn't help but fall in love with his character.I would highly recommend these books to those that like the Fantasy Genre with out alot of mushy romance stuff getting in the way.This is about Hope, Betrayal, Friendship and the love of Ravka....Must Read!",

                "reviewText": "After watching the second season of the Netflix TV Show, I broke down and bought a book or two for the first time in a very long time. So first, I will talk about the set itself and hopefully, come back on to review each individual book once I finish it. I was so excited to get this set of books! I love each books' cover design. And it came with a handy sleeve to keep them all in. Now, I just finished the first book today and started the second. I was surprised by how close the show stayed in-line with the first book, Shadow and Bone. I guess we will see with the other two.So, here is a review of the first book: When reading a book, I can usually come up with my own picture in my mind of the characters, settings, and events of said book. I couldn't really do that with this. I was too busy always comparing it to the show that came out last year (which I love). That is why I like to read the book before I see a movie or show. I love to compare the two. And I got to say, spot on so far! Now I can't wait to finish the next book and possibly get the accompanying books that the show was based on- The Six of Crows Duology and The King of Scars.Editing my review to add on that I finished book 2, Siege and Storm, and book 3, Ruin and Rising. I finished them last week but didn't want to leave the world behind and read something else, so I just started the first one again a few days ago. I am again done with the first and started on the second.So, here are my reviews for the next two books...Siege and Storm- Oh, started off with a ton of action and adventure but for me it did get a little boring in the middle and picked up again towards the end. If you are a big fan of the show, I would probably not read this series. I don't want to give away any spoilers for either one, but prepare yourself if you have already seen the show and wanted to read the books.Ruin and Rising- I loved this one! This one was by far my favorite. There were very few parts that I did not like. It kept me engaged until the very last page!!!! Again prepare yourself, if you love the show.Anyway, this would be a total recommendation from me. Go and get these books! Now!!",
