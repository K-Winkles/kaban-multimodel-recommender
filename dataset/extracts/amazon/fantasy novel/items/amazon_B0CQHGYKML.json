                "reviewText": "I was immediately taken aback by the quality and elegance of the prose, which is what got me initially hooked. I like to think my vocabulary is pretty developed, but reading this book taught me some new words, which was quite delightful. I was admittedly a bit put off by the choice to use present tense, but I was able to move past that pretty quickly.The romance itself was really something else. You could feel the chemistry building between Iona and Ariadne at every stage of their relationship\u2019s development\u2014it was extremely well executed. There are a lot of fantasy romance books out there, but this is the first I\u2019ve read where the relationship actually *felt* magical. My poor little sapphic heart could barely handle it.There are some gripes I have, of course, aside from the choice of tense. The ending was a little trite, I think. **Spoilers Ahead** Like, you spend the entire book building up Morgan\u2019s pendant as this ancient magical artifact of unmatched power, only for someone to pull another equally ancient and powerful artifact out of literal thin air in their moment of need at the final climax? That is some Deus ex Magica right there. And then your other friend apparently has a third ancient magical artifact of power too? I will confess to rolling my eyes a little bit at that point. **Spoiler End**Honestly, though? I can forgive a little triteness. It was a moving gay romance with a charming setting and an enjoyable mystery, and there aren\u2019t enough of those. It\u2019s frankly criminal that this book hasn\u2019t gotten more attention already, even if it is a very recent release.So do yourself a favor and get the book.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed reading the story of Ariadne and Iona, the sex is hot and the story has a good plot that really kept me engaged. I'm not a person who really notices punctuation or grammar stuff unless its really bad and I didn't have any problems with that here. The world building was fantastic and I'm interested to know about some of the other side characters in this storyline but I definitely got the sense this could be a series but its a HEN and wraps up everything so that if its not a series I'm not left hanging. I liked the little displays of jealousy place within the relationship, it added tension to the ultimate buildup. The character and setting descriptions were spot on I felt like I could \"see\" everyone and everything clearly. I'm positive I will be rereading this and I think if you like witches, lesbians,sex, secrets, with a bit of rivalry thrown in you will like it too.",
