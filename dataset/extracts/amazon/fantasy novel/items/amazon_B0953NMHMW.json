                "reviewText": "I have to say that in the last 20 years, my only reading has been non-fiction. I am overjoyed to have found this series of light novels. I do not enjoy manga all that much because of the way it seems to jump around and I tend to get easily lost and have to reread it a couple of times before I get the jist of things (not dumb just too easily distracted). There are not too many animes I will watch, in this case I found too many of them are just not that interesting. So I can name the ones I do like on 2 hands. My son knowing my tastes occasionally gives me names of anime to watch, I have a CrunchyRoll paid account that I rarely use. So, after binge watching The Apothecary Diaries and knowing that they are just being released now to the U.S., I actually went looking for the manga so that I could keep on with the story, even though it is not my favorite way of reading. When I found it, I also found the light novels and immediately bought up the first 10 of them about 4-5 days ago. I am already through book 4 and felt it was necessary to post a review.So, the story revolves around a young girl, Maomao, who was raised by an apothecary and when growing up learned all about medicines and how to use them. When she is kidnapped and sold to the palace to work in the rear palace, where the concubines and their servants live, she tries to keep her head down vowing to work off the two years as a lowly servant. But she cannot help but get involved when she sees that the emperors two new children are dying a slow death and she knows why.The story is really quite fun to read, especially since she just can't let something go that has her curiosity awaken or that she has the knowledge to make better. One of the reviewers mentioned that sometimes the descriptive words used were just weird. There were moments in the story when I was a bit confused as to what they were trying to say. But I found just moving forward into the story resolved those moments of confusion. After 4 books I have to say that I can't put it them down. I am looking forward to the rest of the anime and I really hope that they make all of it. My only suggestion is to watch a few of the episodes before starting on the books so that you have the images in your mind to go along with the story. Like I said, it is on CrunchyRoll and I remember at one time they had a free version and you just had to watch commercials.",

                "reviewText": "One of my favorite animes of this season is based on this light novel. And even though I have just watched this story, it was still a good read. The story itself is not much different than the anime maybe a few details here and there. It looks like the first season or 12 episodes of the anime all come from this first light novel. Which means there will be much more story to discover once the anime is complete.I enjoy this story for several reasons. I like the intrigue that the court aspect brings, and it never goes where you think it\u2019s going to go. I love the characters too. Maomao is such an unusual girl. Smart and worldly but at the same time very naive. I love her. I also adore Jinshi. There has got to be more to him than we know so far. He\u2019s too complex to be someone who overseas part of the rear palace as it is called. The tertiary characters aren\u2019t completely flat either, they have some personality and really fill n the story. It\u2019s well written and well throughout so far. I can\u2019t wait read what will happen next.",

And seeing as how I loved the show- I immediately picked this up. I\u2019m already beginning the second one now! If anyone is wondering or is like me and came from watching the anime first, this book is the entirety of season one. Not sure if that\u2019s common knowledge or common sense, but this is the first light novel I have ever read. And I think the anime did a really good job of including everything from the LN in the show. But really love this so far. Will be reading more. And the illustrations throughout the book are very nice as well. Highly recommend \ud83d\udc9c",

In this story there always seems to be something going on so there aren\u2019t any lulls & the characters are fantabulous.Now on to my biased opinion. I absolutely adore this series. The show & manga are both 10/10 so I decided I needed to get my hands on the light novel. They do give a little more information than the other two (bc it\u2019s a novel duh) and there are so many insights into more than just maomaos thoughts that are lacking in the other 2 forms. Definitely worth checking out if you love this story.I gave it a 4 star bc there were some moments where the descriptive words used were just weird. I\u2019m guessing maybe a translation thing? Not a big deal I just went \u201coh okay\u201d and kept it pushing.",
