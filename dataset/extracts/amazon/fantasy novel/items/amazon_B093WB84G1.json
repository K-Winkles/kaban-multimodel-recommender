                "reviewText": "Hold onto your bookmarks, fellow bookworms, because Sarah J. Maas has unleashed another literary beast upon us \u2013 \"House of Sky and Breath,\" the second installment in the Crescent City series. It's like she took a sip of creativity potion and said, \"Watch me conquer your soul with words!\"First things first, if you haven't devoured the ACOTAR books, you might be wandering through Crescent City with a perplexed expression like a lost tourist. Trust me; you'll want to visit the Courts before taking this scenic route. And if you haven't feasted your eyes upon the Throne of Glass series, well, buckle up, because you're in for a royal treat. But hey, if you're feeling rebellious, you can jump straight from ACOTAR to Crescent City \u2013 just be prepared for a magical rollercoaster that might leave you questioning your life choices.Now, let's talk about the chokehold this book has on your emotions. If \"House of Earth and Blood\" left you gasping for air, \"House of Sky and Breath\" will have you clutching your heart, desperately trying not to spoil anything for your fellow readers. The Asteri have kept their word \u2013 mostly \u2013 but rebels are rebellious, and the threat of chaos looms like a storm cloud over a cozy reading nook.Bryce Quinlan and Hunt Athalar just want to Netflix-and-chill their way to a normal life, but when you've got rebels stirring up trouble, staying silent is about as likely as convincing a cat to take up ballroom dancing. The choice is clear \u2013 fight for what's right or risk the wrath of fictional characters who've never been good at keeping quiet. Spoiler alert: They choose the epic battle route.In this 27-hour-and-42-minute epic audiobook experience narrated by the enchanting Elizabeth Evans (seriously, give this woman all the awards), Maas weaves a story so captivating, that it's like she's playing a symphony on your heartstrings. Move over, Netflix and Hulu \u2013 audiobooks are the new binge-worthy entertainment, and Elizabeth Evans is our auditory goddess.\"House of Sky and Breath\" isn't just sexy and action-packed; it's a literary explosion that makes you rethink your life choices. Maas doesn't just write books; she crafts immersive universes where love is the key, and everything \u2013 and I mean everything \u2013 is possible. The wait for the third book? It's like waiting for a magician to reveal their final trick \u2013 torturous and exciting all at once. This will leave you spiraling for all the theories you can get your hands on, I know I have.So, grab your headphones, dive into the world of Crescent City, and prepare to be mind-blown by the queen herself, Sarah J. Maas. Through love, all is possible, and through Maas, all is enchantingly unpredictable.",

                "reviewText": "\u201cOur love is stronger than time, greater than any distance. Our love spans across stars and worlds. I will find you again, I promise.\u201d\u2728\u2728After the events of HOEAB, Bryce and Hunt are trying to live their lives while staying under the Asteri\u2019s radar. However, rebel activity is on the rise, and they want Bryce, Hunt, and their friends to join the cause. With their home on the precipice of war, Bryce must choose who to fight for and how far she\u2019s willing to go as secrets unravel and her world gets turned upside down.\u2728\u2728At this point, if Maas writes it, I will read it. I love her writing and House of Sky and Breath was no exception. Maas has a particular talent for dropping seemingly irrelevant details that often come back in a big way. This book is full of those details, and you could lose yourself in theory boards trying to sort it all out. One of the elements in this book that I loved was getting a broader range and more page time of characters being focused on outside of Bryce and Hunt. There are so many different groups, fae, shifter, mer, etc., that I appreciated the extra insight into their political workings. I especially found the interactions between Ruhn and agent Daybright fascinating while trying to puzzle out her identity. Also Bryce is starting to develop some Aelin worthy plans, and I\u2019m here for it. The amount of times she\u2019s thinking 10 steps ahead of everyone else it has already figured out the clues, I love it. The vibe of HOSAB had a darker and more tense vibe than HOEAB at least for me. There are lighter and comedic moments to help offset this, though. One of my favorites being the \u2018that\u2019s not a cat\u2019 scene. Once you pick this book up, it\u2019ll be a struggle not to want to finish it in one sitting. I will warn you though, there are so many twists, turns, and mind blowing revelations towards the end that you\u2019ll want book 3 immediately. I highly recommend reading this as well as Maas other work.",

I don't know how to function after finishing this book and I'm so grateful book 3 is coming out next week, but I'm terrified of what it will do to us because there are FOUR Houses - so will we be left in limbo for 2 years until the next comes out???Some things I noticed on the reread.The Emile plot line didn't really DO anything. It sort of was a dud. Unless it picks back up, but I don't think it will. It was weird.Hunt. HUNT. I think I love Hunt more than Rhys, more than Rowan. More than Cassian and Az and Lorcan and Aedion. He's my favorite SJM male. And he and Bryce are perfection. Not perfect, obviously, but they UNDERSTAND each other. It's the dream to be that understood. THAT seen.If my friends get picked off in the next book, I'm gonna be mad. Hunt and Ruhn must live. Everyone must be safe. I can't handle losing any of them!***************************I am wrecked.I need to know what happens. I need to know NOW. If SJM does me dirty on the good guys, I'm going to go find her and tattoo a halo on HER head.This book is chaos. This SERIES is chaos. There is so much, there are so many different TYPES of people, so many underlying stories that all need resolved in the January release.Bryce and Hunt are a delight. Their sarcasm and irreverence and love make me laugh. I like Ruhn even more in this book. I love seeing the depth of characters come to light. I hate the Asteri more. I yelled more at the characters or situations.I NEED MORE. Like... right now.Spice warning - it's there! Enjoy or skip!",

O livro sem a jacket \u00e9 lindo. Estava com medo de chegar amassado mas veio apenas com um pequeno amassadinho em cima e o miolo um pouco sujo mas nada que me incomode. As p\u00e1ginas s\u00e3o um pouco mais \u00e1speras e grossas que a edi\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira pela Galera Record mas isso n\u00e3o incomodou. Acho que essa \u00e9 a edi\u00e7\u00e3o dos Estados Unidos mas n\u00e3o tenho certeza. A \u00fanica coisa que me incomodou um pouco foi o modo como as p\u00e1ginas ficam quando o livro \u00e9 aberto, e parece que o livro \u00e9 fr\u00e1gil pois sempre que eu pego ele sem a jacket, a madeira (ou seja l\u00e1 do que a capa \u00e9 feita) fica rangendo e isso incomoda um pouco.

La plume de SJM est vraiment incroyable et cet univers si vaste est si riche, si vibrant, si obs\u00e9dant. J\u2019ai eu du mal \u00e0 poser le livre pendant ma lecture, \u00e9tant tr\u00e8s attach\u00e9e \u00e0 chacun des personnages de cette histoire. Mon c\u0153ur a battu tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s fort pendant la plupart des \u00e9v\u00e9nements de ce tome 2 et cette fin--, cette fin !!!! Je comprends mieux pourquoi le tome 3 est la sortie plus attendue de l\u2019ann\u00e9e et pourquoi je ne fais que le voir sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux!",
