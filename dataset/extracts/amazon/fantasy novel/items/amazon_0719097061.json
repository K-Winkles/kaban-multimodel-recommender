It\u2019s so basic, but hardly anyone goes into the same depth of explaining what a scene is. Great stuff, and especially great that the book is focused on fantasy specifically.

I was halfway through it but stopped reading it. I Started reading the blue books by William c Martell. I really enjoy reading martell's book and I read one chapter a week over and over again then go back and rereading what I read the previous week. i'm moving slowly through the books. there are like 16 of those blue books and i'm reading all of them. I plan to keep reading William martell but I did enjoy what I read in this book and will come back to it. maybe in a year or two10/20/2020I have finished reading the fantasy fiction formula twice. I'm currently almost finished reading for the third time.By the fourth time reading I will start practicing some of the techniques in the book.I saw on Instagram that Naomi osaka, the tennis player, spent over 10 years losing at tennis to her big sister but she didn't give upI plan to do the same thing with the fantasy fiction formula. I plan to read it over and over again over the next 10 years and practice the techniques8/22/2023I haven't read this book in a long timei learn a lot during that time. the most important thing is repetition is key to learningbut the rarest of human qualities is consistency. so 97 percent give up in 1 yearthat's me right there. i gave up reading this bookbut i am back at it. i will take like 4-6 months reading one chapter because repetition is the key to learningif i don't give up maybe in 5-8 years i will have a noveltake your timerepetitionrepetitionkeep going for yearsnever give upthat's the key to success in anything",

                "reviewText": "I heard about this book from Jim Butcher when he was speaking at a conference. Yeah, I know, his name is dropped in the book several times. Yeah, I know he knows Deborah Chester. Well guess what? I am jealous he knows her and learned from her. I wish I had. As an author, I attend numerous (generally 8 to 10 a year) conventions and often speak on a wide variety of panels on numerous topics. There are some questions that I always get asked. One of them is: What book(s) do you recommend about writing? That question comes in many different shapes and sizes, but that is the meat of it. Here is my new answer: The Fantasy Fiction Formula by Deborah Chester. This book is more valuable than any writing class I have ever been to. Probably all of them put together, if you take out the human interaction factor. If you need to know something about the craft of writing (not the silly grammar rules, but how to make a good story) and it isn't in this book, then there are one of two thing going on: Either you are a super Pro + level author experimenting with something new or you are wasting your time fooling yourself into thinking something is important when you should be concentrating on learning what Deborah Chester has so clearly laid out in this book. This is going on my shelf as a reference book, a refresher course, and, honestly, probably the only book about how to write, other than Stephen King's On Writing that I actually enjoyed reading. Really? I enjoyed reading it? Yeah. That part is a little weird, because this really is a text book on how to craft a good story. A text book. I never enjoyed reading one of those before. I would argue that I am biased because I am a writer and writing fascinates me, but the truth is, I don't usually enjoy reading books on how to write. On a personal note: Deborah, if you read this review, I just wanted to say thank you for writing this book. Everything I write from here on out will be the better for having read this.",
