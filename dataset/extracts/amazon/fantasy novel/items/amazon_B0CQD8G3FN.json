Not overflowing enough for Souma, though, who uses his own marriage as an excuse to push his retainers to confess to their beloveds and tie the knot, too. Admirable as the king's motives are, can the kingdom really handle all this romance, all at once? Read more",

This was a nice change of pace and lent the book a relaxed atmosphere that made it joy to read from start to finish. That isn\u2019t to say there isn\u2019t more to the story to enjoy and narrative seeds to see develop in the future, but rather that the author is leaving those for us to enjoy piecing together in the interim without the most persistent past baggage and questions hounding us. In many ways, the book echoes the feelings that come after real weddings. It may be the end of one chapter in our lives, but it\u2019s just the beginning to a new one.While I\u2019m awaiting the continuation of the series greatly, the payoff of the book is going to make that wait more of a relaxed honeymoon rather than a nail biting cliffhanger. If you\u2019ve enjoyed the books up to this point and like the characters, this book is going to be a treat.",

There are still a few loose ends in terms of world development and we know there are shadows lurking in the horizon that will affect the story moving forward. Nevertheless, this is still a conclusion of an arc. Loved the last story which ties back some conjectures that had been made on previous ones, however, that's the short story and not the main matter of the volume. This volume mostly comprises several interconnected stories from the cast prior and during the wedding ceremonies being held around the kingdom and everybody seems to make at least a small appearance or be mentioned. By the conclusion Kazuya Souma has officially become the Hero king of Elfrieden and Amidonia and it seems things will progress smoothly at least for a little while, so long as the \"other king\" doesn't bare his fangs against Souma's kingdom. But even then, we can see all the players making preparations and resolutions for when that time comes. Looking forward to read more.",

No real politics, no fights, no action, just sweet interaction, reminence and character development. It might not be for everybody, but I liked it. Looking forward to when the story picks up again though...",

Overall this is a very romance centric volume, with many other characters getting married (or at least engaged) in addition to Souma and his queens. The novel's portrayal of polygamy seems unduly rosy, but this volume does have a lot of legitimate warm and fuzzy, feel good moments.",

                "reviewText": "Like others have said the story of this book is a big letdown. Volume 10's focus is on the wedding that has been delayed for 9 volumes and this is fine. It needed to happen at some point and it would have taken a fair part of any other book, but the problem is that dedicating an entire book to it really makes for a lackluster read. The whole book can pretty much be skipped without losing anything for the overall plot of the story. That said there are some enjoyable parts that are kind of like reward for readers who like the personal growth of some of the side characters. The best part of this book however is the extra chapter at the end. This is not in any way a chapter to help the plot or related to the main story of this book, but instead it focus's on the the story of Liscia's mother got to the point to convince King Albert to make Souma the King. This is briefly touched upon earlier in a previous book, but here we get much more to it as well as a small surprise at the end. To me this chapter is what made the book worth the purchase and read in hopes that what is shown gets added to later on. (would really hope the author adds small chapters to follow this up now that its been mentioned.)",
