In a sea of Tolkien fantasy knock-offs, the Russian folktale setting stands out.Dobrinia is such a great hero. A grumpy girl with limb difference on a quest to find the princev (ie, gender neutral princess), sign me up! I love how she's just so unselfconsciously herself, both physically and personality-wise.Highly recommended!",
