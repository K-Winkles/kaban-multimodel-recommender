To be honest, at first I was like, \"Why Robbie???\" But Klune showed me why he is the genius writer, and I am the adoring fan.Once again, I have been sucked into the Green Creek world, and I'm so happy to be here. There's so much emotion in Heartsong. Klune has a way of making you feel each and every thing his characters are feeling. With love and loyalty, family and betrayal, the reader falls in love with the Bennett pack over and over again. Klune taps into that basic human need for connection and acceptance. If you're looking for stories that will gut you and heal you, read the Green Creek series.About the book:It's a story about love, brotherhood, family, betrayal, and oh, (if you couldn't tell from the cover), there are wolves.Read this if you like:\u2022 LGBTQ+ romance\u2022 Fantasy\u2022 Werewolves\u2022 Books that are both character driven and have some action",

It makes you thoughtful, and even now after finishing this installment a week or so ago, I catch myself staring off...appreciating the imagery, in awe of the intricate weave of the story and whole-heartedly agree with the way the author makes you view love and acceptance.I confess, there were a couple of things that didn't quite sit right with me. First, the complete confusion in the beginning that was like a fog that took too long to lift and contradicting events that seemed a bit too convenient, but I chalk it up to this being more of a bridge book to move us into the conclusion coming next summer. I'm not thrilled about the wait, but I'll use it as an excuse to reread the installments I've come to love so much.If you're looking for something different to shake off that book funk, believe me when I say this series will do that!",

                "reviewText": "Honestly, I was very ambivalent towards Robbie based on the previous two books. I just felt he was just kind of 'there' but not really all that significant... this book changed that for me. I will say, however, that I was not happy with the ending... Carter is my favorite... and the ending was just a big rehash of elements of book 1 and 2; seems history truly was doomed to repeat itself. So much for packpackpack.The beginning of this book wasn't confusing for me as much as it was that I couldn't figure out what time period we were in- was this Robbie's past or present... it was a shock when the truth was revealed.I had previously speculated about what I thought this book would entail, but it appears I completely over-thought the storyline. However, it was also interesting to learn from reading the author's blog, that his understanding of the story changed while writing book two... so it makes me wonder a bit about whether the details in book one are significant to the overall story or not. One example... when Ox was young he heard a growl, he talked to it, and then he saw a 'flash of black' and it was gone. Now, Mark is BROWN... so could this have been another wolf he saw that was at the Bennett house, or was this a slip by the author in saying black and not brown?!? Because if he meant black, then this could mean something big for the ending and truth of the Bennetts.In this book, Robbie finds a book and diary in Maine, the book falls behind the bookcase but he keeps the diary. Later, Elizabeth speculates that Thomas must have left the diary behind when they moved (for some reason Robbie never mentions the book even though there is HUGE significance). Yet, in that book that was lost behind the bookcase, Thomas writes \"Ox..Ox...Ox\". This would have been BEFORE they moved, so how much did Thomas actually know about Ox before they officially met when Joe found him? OR... did Osmond or Pappas steal it from the Bennett house after they had moved?!? Based on the ending of this book, there seems to be a lot of secrets kept by the previous two Bennett Alphas... and with Robert Livingstone constantly talking about how things were done to him by Abel, perhaps Robert isn't the evil mastermind that we were led to believe... perhaps the truth is, Abel wasn't the benevolent Alpha we all think. It would be nice if, in the end, Robert actually redeems himself. And keep in mind, the title for the next book 'Brothersong' involves Carter and Kelly as well as Gordo and Gavin.",

Esse e primeiro livro competem entre si porque s\u00e3o os melhores da s\u00e9rie e s\u00e3o sobre os melhoreis romances ! Eu amei as mem\u00f3rias do Cas com sua fam\u00edlia mas eu estava muito ansiosa para o encontro entre os dois acontecesse. Foi incr\u00edvel como eles se encontraram. O Cas \u00e9 muito paciente e persistente com o Gavin. O Gavin me surpreendeu, o modo como ele ainda que teimoso, t\u00edmido e com medo se manteve firme e confiante e sarc\u00e1stico com o Cas. A hist\u00f3ria n\u00e3o me decepcionou em nenhum momento. Foi um livro incr\u00edvel e um \u00f3timo livro pra finalizar a s\u00e9rie.Me bateu tristeza quando acabou porque quero mais sobre este mundo e estes personagens. Eu acho que acima de tudo fiquei triste com o fim pelo fato de querer mais sobre a fam\u00edlia. Para mim, al\u00e9m do romance, a intera\u00e7\u00e3o da fam\u00edlia foi um dos fatos que mais contribuirem para amar e me prender em todos os livros.",

It has so many facets and infinite wisdoms that it is impossible not to think about it.It's not just all the shifters, the amazing werewolves, that make the story so unique and addictive. That's are also the witches and humans that are part of the story, that are part of the pack, that make the experience of what this book is so wonderful.One thing is for sure, I have never read a book like this.I'm in love with all that's this series.I'm currently reading the last book in the series and can't wait to see what the author will put me through ;-)This series is not a standalone series!",

Whhaaaaat ?This book is absolutely NOTHING like what I though it would be and is absolutely PERFECT.I was pissed at it at first, it had been a while since I yelled at a book ! It was frustrating, and sweet, and sad, and hopeful, and once again so filled with found family and love and pack :) The writing is glorious, the bits of humour essentials, the atmosphere all-encompassing, the story fascinating.I can't wait to get my hand on Brothersong. A year is way too long, but I can tell it'll be different too, bringing us in a fourth direction to end this beautiful adventure !",
