I love a good fantasy quest and this read like a short, light version of an epic fantasy. Pared down character list, no over elaborate battle scenes and an easy to follow set of world-rules. My only complaint is the rather abrupt cliff-hanger ending but hopefully I have a chance to read the next book in the series soon so this is not a huge issue. I look forward to the next book in the series and I am definitely glad that I stuck with it.",

It comes together to create an interesting world and plot that, while not wholly unique, captures and keeps you invested from page one.The start of this book, following a fast paced prologue, is a bit slow as the characters come together and begin their quest. I personally enjoyed it as it set up stakes of the book and introduced us to some side characters that I immediately loved and hope make further appearances in later books. By around the midway point, as the pilgrimage is underway, the story picks up and the plot begins to take shape. The mystery around Inara and her powers and connection to a god kept me guessing and Elogast's unwavering loyalty and love of baking had my whole heart. And while not every character is immediately lovable (looking at you, Skedi), by the end, I was rooting for them all.This is a book that left me wanting more. An excellent opening to what will eventually be a trilogy, and I cannot wait to see where it goes!TW: Violence, Blood, Burning, Sacrifice, Death",

Even when I could see where it was going, there were surprises, and it was so joyous to see how well everything I\u2019ve been thought out.The characters were also so very lovely. Kissen is so well drawn. Complicated and angry but choosing to care for people fiercely in the face of her trauma. Absolutely a five-star read!",

                "reviewText": "I'm glad I waited for this book to go on sale, because it wasn't great.My biggest complaint with Godkiller is its lack of craft and execution. This is a story set in what could've been an interesting fantasy world that is actually quite bland. Gods used to be everywhere, but the young king banned their public worship. Despite this, many people still worship gods and are willing to risk it all to go on pilgrimages.The writing in this book is serviceable. The characters are as well. The dialogue is okay. And that makes it not very enjoyable to read. The twist at the end of the book came out of nowhere; the \"untwist\" of Inara's parentage, despite stray dialogue making it pretty clear that she's half-god (and even possibly the king's daughter), was strangely saved for a future installment.I feel as if the author tried to make Kissen and Elo \"unreliable narrators\" in that they keep their emotions and thoughts guarded even in their POV chapters. This doesn't work. Instead of making them mysterious or even preserving future twists, it just made their motivations hard to understand. I don't really know why they did the things they did, and the author didn't let us hear it from them either.My last complaint is a twist we get halfway through the book, where Elo realizes he'd been cursed by the inn owner who arranged the pilgrimage party. We're shown many people with curse marks and explicitly told that they're the work of gods. So how did a human make one? It's implied that a god was working through the inn owner... but we don't ever meet that god. What was their reason for cursing Elo? It contradicted previously established worldbuilding and thus it made for a bad twist.",

                "reviewTitle": "A Debut Novel? A Debut Masterpiece",
                "reviewText": "When I found out that Godkiller was the debut novel of Hannah Kaner I was honestly shocked.The writing is confident, the descriptions are lush, and the characters are well-formed.Then I discovered that Kaner had been working on this novel for over 15 years and things started to make a little bit more sense.Godkiller is very clearly a labour of intense love and passion. This is a world that has clearly been iterated on and thought about over a long period of time, deep care has been taken in the crafting of its lore and the structure of its narrative. It's a success at setting things up for a wider trilogy, but also as a story in its own right.For a debut author these are not always easy things to accomplish. Kaner does it with style.Godkiller follows four main characters, each with their own point of view chapters. At first I thought this was going to be disorienting, thankfully that wasn't to be the case and it gave us good insight into the thoughts and feelings of all the characters we were following, especially when all of them finally link up together in the narrative.The story takes these four characters on journies of self-discovery and growth, and by the end of it all none of them are the same. Beliefs are challenged and changed, fights are fought and won and sometimes they are lost. This all culminates in a heartfelt final stand and a twist that I genuinely didn't see coming.There is romance in this book, which if made the main focus can be a bit of a turnoff for me. But it was woven throughout the narrative of the story incredibly well, unobtrusive and natural. Though do be aware there is some mildly graphic sex stuff toward the end so if you aren't fond of that you may want to skip the segment or the book entirely.Godkiller is a masterstroke of a debut novel. It surprises, it thrills and most importantly it grips you from beginning to end. It's an incredible first step into fiction that was clearly crafted with love and care every step of the way. Kaner has done a great job setting up the rest of this series, now all she has to do is stick the landing.",

                "reviewTitle": "A debut killer",
                "reviewText": "I was taken aback by the depth of this world and the imagery that Hannah Kaner evoked. This reads not like someone's debut, but like a story that benefited from the years-long experience of a seasoned writer. It was never boring, even when the action slowed down, and the characters were easy to love - or hate, when the situation required it.Kissen is an amazing protagonist, whose motivations and character leap from the page. Her companions compliment her nicely as she navigates the world and her relationship with these companions.The perspective switches are nice, as other characters have equally realistic and engaging stories to tell.I give this a 5 star because, for me, it is re-readable. It is epic storytelling and I can't wait for that elusive sequel. The 5 star rating is more than earned.",
