I\u2019m really sad I have to wait several months for the next and possibly final volume. I\u2019m gonna be sad because I have been really enjoying this story. I hope certain characters get their asses handed to them. I hope there isn\u2019t some cracked out twist that will lead me disappointed. I\u2019m deciding on whether I should start reading the web novel but it might be different from what I read in the afterword so I guess I shall wait and let the anticipation get the best of me.",

Questions from the previous novel were answered and context was established for future events.There were a couple of events that I wish had gone a bit differently, but overall im pleased with the story's progression.There are quite a few loose ends, a few from the previous volume were not completely resolved so I'm waiting for that.The illustrations, as always, are immaculate.The story took a few turns and had a few digressions. The intent and purpose of those segues were unclear.Hmm, I wasnt exactly thrilled, but the writing is still excellent and im already a fan who has to know how this story shakes out. 4 stars.",
