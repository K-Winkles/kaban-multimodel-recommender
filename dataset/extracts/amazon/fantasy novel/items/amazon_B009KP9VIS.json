                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Formulaic, but fair",
                "reviewText": "Overall, a solid read, but as I was able to put it down and didn't feel compelled to finish it, can't say it was an exceptional read. Here are the pros and cons:Pros: Fast paced story with a lot of intrigue. There were many twists and turns which kept you curious as to how everything would weave together.Cons: VERY formulaic - I knew who the villain would be about a quarter of the way through the book and just waited for the story to play out the \"why\". Over the top romance - I love a little romance, but if the female character's \"flaw\" is she's unquestionably stunning but doesn't know it, there's no interest. It is so unbelievable and over the top. What woman fears about being seen as too beautiful? Definitely not written for a female audience. Give her a crooked nose or a rounded stomach or have her two front teeth cross, but making her an athletic Cleopatra is too unrelatable and therefore unbelievable. Additionally, although I do think love at first sight can exist, again WAY WAY WAY over the top with the instant infatuation and possessiveness of a person you just met. Lust can be instantaneous, sure, but....he immediately knows she is the woman he wants to marry because she is so darn hot? Honestly, as a woman, that did nothing for me. Give her a personality and let him fall in love with that, not just because she's hot, with a smokin' body and is vulnerable so could use a big strong man to cry to. Lastly, the plot...as awful as describing horrible things can be, if you are trying to paint a horrible scene, you have to give some of the gory details. It is clear there are lots of deaths from a serial killer within the first 20 pages of the book, but the author shares only a baseline of information to let you know people were beaten and killed. Then much, much later in the book she uses character comments / conversations like, 'we need to protect children from pedaphiles' to let the readers know the perpetrator was a pedaphile. By this point, it is so late in the story I don't have the same emotional attachment or repulsion that otherwise would have had, and without some graphic detail, no insight to what that word really means in context of the story. I wasn't rooting for the killer to be brought to justice, which is a shame considering how perverse the author is trying to make the perpetrator in this story. Lastly, way too many 'Hero' moments. Author does a great job trying to explain them away, realizing it is irrational to leave a person alone for half an hour after you refused to let the person out of your sight for minutes. Or illogical to leave a room without a phone or wallet to meet a stranger but not let anyone know where you are going even though there is a killer stalking you. But the explanations are weak, along the lines of the character saying, \"what was I thinking, trying to be the hero on my own?\" My reply is, what was I thinking, continuing to read the ridiculous scene?I realize way more cons than pros, sorry. I think the author is a good writer and creative, but went more for trite, commonplace, and formulaic for this book. Read more like a what I imagine a harlequin romance novel would be. For me, this didn't work. For those looking for PG-13 romance with unrealistic characters who are straight out of a Hollywood set, you will likely like this book. I think this would do well with young adults.",

When long buried bodies are uncovered there are more questions than answers and Michael and Jamie have to work together to keep Jamie alive and to find her brother Chris.They last saw each other as broken and devastated teenagers, this meeting uncovers very different feelings for both of Michael and Jamie. We have seen Michael in protective mode before with Lacey, but here everything is intensified and he finally realises the love and protection he felt for Lacy were brotherly and there is nothing brotherly about his feelings for Jamie.....he has finally found his match!It is a long and emotional fight as they uncover secrets, lies and corruption at the highest level and a little too close to home. This is a haunting book that will leave you emotionally exhausted but eager for more from the Bone Secrets series.I read this on Kindle Unlimited.",

                "reviewTitle": "Enjoyable thriller with a bit of romance",
                "reviewText": "I thoroughly enjoyed this thriller. It had all the right ingredients to make it strive. The story is about a school-bus full of children who went missing ten years ago. Only one boy was found alive. Now after ten years, the bones of the missing children are found buried near a farm. All but one boy. It was brilliant. I also enjoyed the brief romance. The big baddy was truly bad but thankfully Elliot didn't go too much into the gruesome crimes. I started to understand who the true culpit was about 70% into the book. But it still made me go on to understand the WHY. I will definitively pick up more from this author.",

Delightful story, terrific characters that have character and some unexpected surprises from left field. Am now looking forward to reading the next in the series. I'm always a sucker for murder mysteries and I'm ordering the next one as soon as I get home.",

                "reviewText": "Das Buch ist recht spannend, aber insgesamt in vielen Dingen zu oberfl\u00e4chlich. Das ist schade, denn man h\u00e4tte hier die Geschichte deutlich differenzierter und auch detaillierter ausarbeiten k\u00f6nnen. Auch einige Charaktere wie z.B. \"The Senator\" bleiben sehr flach.Manche Stellen waren daf\u00fcr sehr langatmig, deshalb habe ich das Buch irgendwie ein wenig als unausgewogen empfunden. Wer einen spannenden Krimi sucht, welchen man ohne viel Nachzudenken einfach weglesen kann und aush\u00e4lt, dass es hier um gefolterte und ermordete Kinder geht, dem kann man das Buch trotz aller Schw\u00e4chen empfehlen.",
