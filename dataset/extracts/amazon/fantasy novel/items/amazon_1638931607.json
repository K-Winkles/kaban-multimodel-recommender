            "Editorial Reviews Review A Best book of 2023NPR \u2022 Barnes & Noble \u2022 Elle \u2022 Book Riot \u2022 BookPage \u2022 GoodReads \u2022 Shondaland \u2022The Observer \u2022 PolyGon \u2022 HuffPost \u2022 Powell\u2019s\u201cAt once heartbreaking and unapologetically strange, this is a cross-cultural, syncretic, folksy, razor-sharp narrative about the horrors of grief and the eternal debate over nature versus nurture. . . . Monstrilio packs in a lot, and the author pulls it off brilliantly. It is at once dark and tender, at times bleak, but balanced with humor that borders on slapstick . . . an outstanding debut; for all the ground being broken in genre-bending horror, his is a distinctive, exciting new voice in fiction.\u201d \u2015Gabino Iglesias, Los Angeles Times\u201cBizarre and brilliant, Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova\u2019s Monstrilio is a sort of modern Frankenstein.\u201d \u2015Lauren Puckett-Pope, ELLE\u201cHow to explain my love of this bizarre book? It is grotesque, heavy, gut-wrenching, and painful and I still loved it . . . There is a lot in this story to unpack around death, self-acceptance, unconditional love, and challenging social norms.\u201d \u2015Cheri Anderson, Boston Globe\u201cIn his masterful and surreal debut novel, Mexican author Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova revels in the mire of grief, then lifts the veil and gets playful with it, like the Brothers Grimm ghostwriting Stephen King . . . Monstrilio is full of surprises and delightfully messed up\u2015at once precise and inscrutable and horrifying.\u201d \u2015Patrick Rapa, The Philadelphia Inquirer\u201cThis book is a slow-burning monster story incrementally creeping up on the unsuspecting reader . . . [and] a creative study on the process of mourning and the lengths people will extend themselves in order to preserve a loved one's spirit, presence, and essence.\u201d \u2015Jim Piechota, Bay Area Reporter\u201cAn extraordinary act of imagination, an extended meditation that begins in grief, family, belonging, and moves past that, into a deeper discovery of the power of love\u2015and the powerlessness of love, as well its strangeness. With Monstrilio, S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova makes a remarkable, kaleidoscopic debut.\u201d \u2015Alexander Chee, author of How to Write an Autobiographical Novel\u201cSimply exquisite. Easily one of my favorite reads this year.\u201d \u2015Sarah Gailey, bestselling author of Just Like Home and The Echo Wife\u201cGerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova\u2019s dark, soulful magic puts me in mind of Kelly Link or Carmen Maria Machado (and further back, Mary Shelley). The horror of grief has rarely been so viscerally or movingly evoked.\u201d \u2015Peter Ho Davies, author of A Lie Someone Told You About Yourself\u201cHaunting and often bleakly humorous, Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova\u2019s Monstrilio is a captivating tone poem of trauma, grief, and transformation. C\u00f3rdova writes with the lyrical precision of a master surrealist and creates an uncompromising vision of literary horror that is so wholly unique and utterly his own.\u201d \u2015Eric LaRocca, author of Things Have Gotten Worse Since We Last Spoke and Other Misfortunes\u201cHeartfelt, bizarre, and unexpected, S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova\u2019s Monstrilio, which tells the story of a grieving mother who ends up raising a creature that grew from a chunk of her dead son\u2019s lung as her child, is unlike anything else in contemporary horror. At once a novel about family and love, a creepy tale that questions what it means to be human, and a celebration of queer stories, Monstrilio is as shocking as it is profound, and as humorous as it is thoughtful. With any luck, this novel, which is rich in cultural context and ideas, will catapult its author straight into the radars of not only horror lovers but also all readers who enjoy great writing.\u201d \u2015Gabino Iglesias, The Boston Globe\u201cIn Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova\u2019s spare, soulful, and singular Monstrilio, a mother\u2019s grief turns monstrous, literally taking on a life of its own. As tender and terrifying as its titular character, Monstrilio is just as likely to work its way into your heart as into your nightmares. Prepare to unhinge your jaw and devour it whole.\u201d \u2015Maria Adelmann, author of Girls of a Certain Age and How to be Eaten\u201cMonstrilio is the monster story about grief I've been craving. Bloody and full of longing, it gets under your skin and doesn\u2019t let you go. A thrilling and heartbreaking ride from Mexico City to NYC to Berlin, brilliantly capturing what it means to lose someone you love with ferocious tenderness. Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova is an international revelation and one of the boldest new voices writing today.\u201d \u2015Akil Kumarasamy, author of Meet Us by the Roaring Sea and Half Gods\u201cMonstrilio is unlike any other book I\u2019ve read. Genuinely scary at times, it moved me with its humanity, made me laugh, and ultimately, made me cry. Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova has written a stunning exploration of grief, belonging, and familial love in prose so beautiful you won\u2019t want to rush through it\u2015even as you need to know what happens next.\u201d \u2015Ana Reyes, author of The House in the Pines\u201cPart of a new wave of haunted house horror that continues to expand and redefine the genre, Monstrilio is about a woman who creates a monster from a piece of her dead son\u2019s lung, feeding it bloody sacrifices as it grows into the image of her long-gone child. Her monstrilio is loved, cared for, and wholly monstrous. But are not the monsters among us also capable (and deserving) of love? Read this if you liked Sarah Gailey\u2019s Just Like Home!\u201d \u2015Molly Odintz, Lit Hub\u201cWhat lengths would you go to get back someone you\u2019ve loved and lost? Just for a bit, to look in their eyes one more time, or tell them what needed to be told? But play that possibility out to its inevitable conclusion and it\u2019s difficult to envision anything good coming from it. In C\u00f3rdova\u2019s horror debut, a grieving mother in Mexico City goes to unimaginable extremes to bring her late 11-year-old son back to life, only to discover that there are worse things than death. Grief, she learns, is not something to be trifled with, or worse, avoided.\u201d \u2015Il\u2019ja R\u00e1ko\u0161, The Millions\u201cS\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova\u2019s work is as devastating as its premise is whimsical.\u201d \u2015Carl Lavigne, Ploughshares\u201cGerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova is hitting the ground running with his debut novel. . . . Stunning and horrifying.\u201d \u2015Bob Pastorella, This is Horror\u201cS\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova\u2019s writing is piercing and intimate. Whether describing Monstrilio\u2019s first, vicious moments of life or the subtle, strained romance between Magos and her childhood friend Lena, S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova keeps readers breathless . . . his novel seeks to embody [grief], making this nameless, eternal pain something we can speak to and hold.\u201d \u2015Eric Ponce, Book Page, starred review\u201cGerardo writes with the potency of a master, painting an image that takes feelings of genuine sadness and morphs it into a very disturbing situation. I read those first few pages with watery eyes and a grimace on my face, and from that moment on, I couldn\u2019t put the book down. This genre-bender takes an incredibly sad tale of loss and grief and coats it in surrealism and horror, and the result is one of the most original and fascinating novels you\u2019ll read this year. . . . An amazing read. Don\u2019t miss it.\u201d \u2015Akram Herrak, Independent Book Review, starred review\u201cS\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova\u2019s prose is beautiful . . . He captures the heartbreak in aching detail, and the strangeness of the tale only adds to the power of emotions here. He also does a fantastic job of using setting to support the story without overpowering. Bloody and tender, Monstrilio is a singular novel, elevating both horror and family drama into something universal and unforgettable.\u201d \u2015Sarah Rachel Egelman, Bookreporter\u201cIn this wicked debut novel, S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova combines queer themes touching on identity, kink, and consent with Latin American mysticism for an unusually visceral coming-of-age tale . . . There\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s nothing quite like it. A Promethean fable about reconstruction, reinvention, and the occasional human-sized snack.\u201d \u2015Kirkus Reviews\u201cGrief takes the shape of a monster in S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova\u2019s disturbing yet touching literary horror debut . . . S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova creates complex characters who make difficult decisions that blur the lines between being human and being a monster. Fans of Eric LaRocca, Agustina Bazterrica, and Carmen Maria Machado will appreciate this unique take on the horror genre.\u201d \u2015Ver\u00f3nica N. Rodr\u00edguez, Booklist\u201cC\u00f3rdova asks the reader to consider the limits of familial love and understanding. He provides no easy answers, and readers may find themselves touched and horrified in equal measure . . . An enthralling debut that packs a heavy emotional punch. Fans of domestic horror like Zoje Stage\u2019s Baby Teeth or Ashley Audrain\u2019s The Push will find a lot to chew on here.\" \u2015Colin Chappell, Library Journal\u201cThe beastliness of grief is heartbreakingly rendered in C\u00f3rdova\u2019s folklore-inflected first novel, which follows a bereaved mother taking the lung of her recently deceased son and nurturing it back into the boy she lost. But death can never be totally thwarted, and the son that returns isn\u2019t quite the same.\u201d \u2015Michelle Hart, Electric Lit\u201cIn this imaginative debut, one mother is going to discover the limits to maternal love\u2015but not before lots of terrible stuff happens . . . Raising a piece of a corpse to love as your own child sounds like a good idea, right? Spoiler: No, no it does not.\u201d \u2015Liberty Hardy, Book Riot\u201cGerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova\u2019s novel Monstrilio is a surreal and haunting debut, a book I could not put down that exquisitely explores themes of love and grief.\u201d \u2015Largehearted Boy\u201cSly and unsettling . . . S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova does a good job elucidating the contours of grief and love. This creepy work of psychological horror gives readers plenty to chew on.\u201d \u2015Publishers Weekly\u201cGerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova pens a creative, visionary, and fantastic examination of grief and love; parents and children; friends and lovers. Once you start the book, you won\u2019t be able to un-read it. Unforgettable is the most perfect word here.\u201d \u2015Barnes & Noble Editors, Most Anticipated Book Releases of March 2023\u201cA debut novel like no other . . . This beautiful (yes, I said 'beautiful') novel will be the most talked about Horror book of the season.\u201d \u2015Jules Herbert, B&N Reads\u201cA literary horror tale that trudges through the gruesome, visceral parts of grief nobody likes talking about. With othering queerness at its core, Monstrilio won't hurt you, but will absolutely knock you around a bit. You've read nothing like it.\u201d \u2015Stacy Wayne D., Powell\u2019s\u201cQueer author Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova is having a moment. The University of Michigan grad\u2019s debut horror novel, Monstrilio, out now, is the talk of the literary community.\u201d \u2015Sarah Bricker Hunt, Pride Source\u201cGerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova dives head-first into a complex blend of conventional literary fiction and disquieting horror . . . The book\u2019s departures from realism only enhance this message of healing and introspection, giving the novel an insightful and deeply human quality. Stylistically, Monstrilio shines. An intimate stream-of-consciousness writing style places the reader directly in the mind of the narrator, yet the prose\u2019s depth and beauty keeps the book a page-turner . . . Monstrilio is a wild ride that questions the limits of love, family, and what it means to be human.\u201d \u2015Aiden J. Bowers, The Harvard Crimson\u201cFor readers with a soft spot for unconventional monster fiction, Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova\u2019s debut novel Monstrilio is packed with metaphor and nuanced layers of horror and humanity. The novel draws the reader into the raw, intimate spaces of mourning and creates something distinctly original as the story effortlessly blends speculative horror with grief, sexuality, and what it means to be human . . . C\u00f3rdova masterfully blends the elements of literary horror and folklore to create something distinctly modern and unique.\u201d \u2015Corrine Watson, f(r)iction\u201cAn outstanding novel that . . . brings to the forefront elements of grief, loss, love, and loneliness. These elements, without compromise, are real and the most raw of human emotions. These emotions are easily explorable, just as they are. This read was a fresh take on horror . . . one that I had never seen before.\u201d \u2015Mark Haskell, The Gatepost\u201cGerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova\u2019s debut literary horror mix seems plucked straight out of a Guillermo del Toro film . . . a deeply wrought narrative that tackles grief with prose that is as beautiful as it is delightfully gory.\u201d \u2015Brigid Flanagan, The Observer About the Author Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova is a writer and artist from Mexico City, where he currently resides. He holds an MFA in Fiction from the University of Michigan. He has studied with Alexander Chee at Bread Loaf as a work/study scholar, and with Garth Greenwell at Tin House.

Acting on fierce maternal instinct and the dubious logic of an old folktale, she nurtures the lung until it gains sentience, growing into the carnivorous little Monstrilio she keeps hidden within the walls of her family\u2019s decaying Mexico City estate. Eventually, Monstrilio begins to resemble the Santiago he once was, but his innate impulses\u2015though curbed by his biological and chosen family\u2019s communal care\u2015threaten to destroy this fragile second chance at life. A thought-provoking meditation on grief, acceptance, and the monstrous sides of love and loyalty, Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova blends bold imagination and evocative prose with deep emotional rigor. Told in four acts that span the globe from Brooklyn to Berlin, Monstrilio offers, with uncanny clarity, a cathartic and precise portrait of being human. Read more",

There are a few really gory scenes that were a bit tough to read, but necessary to the story. The POV switches in the novel were really interesting and well done, too. It was also refreshing to read because everyone in the book is queer, even the monster! Fun 3.5* novel!",

                "reviewText": "#reading #Monstrilio (Zando 2023) by #GerardoS\u00e1manoC\u00f3rdova. This is an #amazing #book. It\u2019s #horrifying. And it\u2019s #creepy. And it\u2019s so #overthetop you\u2019ll catch your breath. It\u2019s also #human and #heartbreaking. I\u2019ve even caught myself laughing in places. More a nervous giggle. This is a new #writer and a #novel to be reckoned with. And it\u2019s his first one. The prose is #stunning and #colorful and lean and effusive, and #restrained while in most paragraphs, it sways heavy with meaning. The bookstore had it shelved with \u201c#Horror\u201d #fiction. I\u2019ll say. Jesus. I jumped when the wind coming in through the back window met the air being sucked out the other end of the house by the front window\u2014and a door in between about a foot from where I was sitting slammed shut like a coffin lid.\u2014But it\u2019s also not horror fiction. It\u2019s dramatic and its characters are sharply drawn in just handfuls of words. It\u2019s also folkloric and is run through with a feeling that just being there\u2014anywhere near this story\u2014is a risk. Like walking along the edge of a cliff is a risk; or going around in graveyards at night; or saying \u2018Bloody Mary\u2019 in a mirror three times. That keeps things tense. These are things we shouldn\u2019t be seeing. Or overhearing. Private things. Couched in a gripping style. You\u2019re going to wish you hadn\u2019t seen or heard a damn thing once you\u2019ve begun the arc of this tale. We have been reading it out loud in bits. It\u2019s too #beautiful not to #savor. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "Book Information\"Monstrilio\" is a novel written by Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova, a writer and artist from Mexico City. It was published on March 7, 2023, and spans 306 pages. An audio version of the book, narrated by Victoria Villarreal and Johnny Rey Diaz, is 7 Hours and 58 Minutes and is set to be released on June 13. \"Monstrilio\" serves as Gerardo's debut novel, following his previous works in the form of short stories.SummaryMagos, a mother overwhelmed with grief, resorts to a drastic and unconventional measure following the death of her son, Santiago. In a desperate bid to cling to a fragment of his existence, she removes a portion of his lung. Driven by maternal instinct and influenced by a folk tale, Magos assumes the role of caregiver to this bit of organ.The lung segment gradually acquires sentience, transforming into an entity known as Monstrilio. Concealing Monstrilio, Magos nurtures it diligently and in secrecy. As Monstrilio matures, it increasingly bears an uncanny resemblance to Santiago\u2014a poignant reflection of Magos' enduring love for her departed child.However, beneath Monstrilio's outward resemblance to Santiago lies a primal nature, compelled by carnivorous instincts that jeopardize the fragile second chance at life granted by Magos. The collective support provided by Magos' biological and chosen family partially mitigates Monstrilio's destructive tendencies. Yet, the constant threat of losing control looms ominously.My Thoughts\"Monstrilio\" by Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova is a beautifully written and deeply powerful narrative that explores themes of grief, family dynamics, and self-discovery. The story begins with a mother's desperate grief over the loss of her child, delving into the different ways people express and interpret grief, which can create divisions within families. C\u00f3rdova's raw depiction of a family grieving is both poignant and moving.In addition to the exploration of grief, \"Monstrilio\" takes readers on a transformative journey with the character M. M starts as a literal monster and gradually transforms into a teenager, navigating issues of sexuality, internal struggles, self-doubt, and the challenge of fitting into a world that feels alien to him. The book delves into GLBTQ relationships across various characters and explores kinks, sometimes non-consensual in nature. Readers who may be uncomfortable with these themes should be aware of their presence, as the book description does not provide insight into their inclusion.The narrative unfolds through multiple points of view, allowing readers to intimately connect with characters like Magos, the grieving mother; Joseph, the father who struggles to empathize with Magos' loss; Lena, Magos' closest friend; and eventually, M or Monstrilio. These diverse perspectives add depth and provide unique insights into the story.The audiobook version of \"Monstrilio\" is skillfully narrated by Victoria Villarreal and Johnny Rey Diaz. Their performances bring the story to life. However, at times, it can be challenging to distinguish between the characters when they are speaking.While \"Monstrilio\" is undeniably well written, readers expecting a horror-focused narrative may find themselves disappointed. The book leans more towards literary fiction, with elements of horror used more as a vehicle to explore the human condition, particularly grief, family dynamics, and sexual/kink exploration.One aspect that may divide readers is the book's resolution or lack thereof. The story concludes in an open-ended manner, leaving many questions unanswered. Readers accustomed to structured story arcs and a definitive resolution may find this aspect less satisfying. I know I fall into that category.Recommendation\"Monstrilio\" by Gerardo S\u00e1mano C\u00f3rdova is a unique and moving story that combines powerful themes with beautiful prose. The exploration of grief, family dynamics, and self-discovery is handled with depth and sensitivity. While the book may not fully align with the expectations of horror enthusiasts, if you are looking for a literary fiction novel that offers a thought-provoking examination of the human experience\u2026.this book may be for you.Rating3 Monstrous Stars",

                "reviewText": "Even though I read an ebook advance copy, I preordered the hardcover as soon as it was available, because this is a new favorite. The beauty of the writing drew me in, but the understanding of grief, and the different forms it can take was masterful.If someone is seeking traditional horror, this probably isn't what you're looking for. The book certainly has gore, but it's a very emotive and deeply layered work, no quick scares to be had here.How can we come to love a monster?What does it cost for a being to deny their very essence, is a monster ever just a monster? This book makes me think about many topics surrounding otherness, grief, masking, etc. I love a book that makes me think, but this one also made me feel deeply, examining elements of my own life with a child who's had a plethora of health issues, and yet it was not without humor (and body horror).I really enjoyed seeing the story unfold through the eyes of those who loved Monstrilio, the layers of symbolism and metaphor will stay with me, and likely continue to develop long after the book is closed. This stands out as my favorite read of 2022, out of more than 100 books. I would have read it in a sitting if life hadn't kept interrupting. Looking forward to more from the author, I'll be eagerly waiting for more! Thank you Netgalley and @Zando publishing for allowing me early access.",
