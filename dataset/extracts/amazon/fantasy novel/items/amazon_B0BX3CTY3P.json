Finally the main character reaches the kingdom in the fantasy world, nothing original takes places but the story ends in a good cliffhanger. The only but, I found is the scenes in the real world border in ridiculous. I think the author goes overboard with the scenes where the mc shows his strength. But overall a good read, fun and with a cast of cool characters.",

However, I was hoping for this to cover content that wasn't already unveiled in the anime. It feels almost as though it was a waste of a volume. I guess I imagine anyone consistently buying volume after volume would have watched the anime, and therefore, the content could have been covered in the prologue, which would allow for the story to progress.My point is that while it wasn't bad, I am disappointed it isn't actually new and is missing content already covered. I look forward to and will purchase the next next one in hopes of finding out what happens next though.",
