                "reviewText": "While I don't think reading this out of context will endear the characters enough to create brand new fans of 14, this short story collection is excellent for pre-existing fans. The stories are divided up into four sections, and cover from the very beginning of A Realm Reborn to after the end of Stormblood. Each of the stories really do help deepen the world and characters that are familiar to those who have played through the sections of the game's main story each section aligns with.Also, while most of the stories are available for free on the official website, the original stories are spread out to three of the four sections - as far as I can tell, A Realm Reborn is the only section where all of the stories are fully available. It also seems that the included illustrations for each story is exclusive to this collection.Given how long publishing generally takes, I don't believe the exclusion of Shadowbringers or Endwalker was due to anything other than them still being at least partially unreleased through most of the publishing process. However, I'm hoping we get a volume 2 in a few years (once we have 7.0 and a few patches + 2 years for the publication process)",

The stories inside are from the after stories after the first few expansions along with one or two extras exclusively for this book?

The stories are short, a few pages long, and mostly flash fiction. If you are a fan of the game you should buy this, and it's a great compilation of these stories in written form, but you won't be awed or amazed by the reveals. Most of the stories are one or two scenes long, and if there is a fight you might witness a brief clash but you aren't getting much more story value out of this book.None of these stories have integral lore required to appreciate or play the game (unlike other MMORPG novels, such as World of Warcraft's novels).",
