To her saviours, she speaks of Calignius \u2013 a smog-shrouded mining town deep in the mountains that has been gripped by a strange epidemic.Now, Runar Skoldolfr and Tiberius Grim must lead a small expedition into the haunted vales of the Blood-Rock Peaks to answer the girl\u2019s pleas for aid.

If they are to survive, they will need to find a way to unite against the daemons that divide them. Read more",
