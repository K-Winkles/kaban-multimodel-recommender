This is the perfect type of book for a cold, snowy evening with a cup of tea and some shortbread to hand. I found the author to be very descriptive in revealing his world and characters. I quickly found myself becoming attached to some of the primary characters, and cared greatly about their backgrounds and their impact on the central character. Overall, a wonderful read. The only complaint I have (and it is minor), is that the ending seemed just a tad rushed. I would have liked to see a bit more of a robust, extended ending. Hopefully the author will continue with more books, I would be more than happy to continue losing myself in this world. Well done!",

Completely uncalled for injection of absolute horror into an otherwise wonderful book. (Kidding. Mostly. The idea keeps sidling back into my brain at inconvenient times and making me shudder.)",
