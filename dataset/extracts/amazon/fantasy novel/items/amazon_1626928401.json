                "reviewText": "This volume is an actual chapter of character progression, bonding, and growth. The last two volumes focused less on the party, and more on others and Haruhiro-kun. His own party was delegated to \"Where are they, ah ok, they are alive. I am weak. Ah, they are alive.\" Which grinded the story to a cool battle, but a halt to the driving force which is the character bonding.In this volume however it actually had some development, Haruhiro-kun actually finding out what has happened between Merry-san and Kuzaku-san. Shihoru-san actually conversing to Haruhiro-kun and him seeing what they think of him as a leader more. Ranta-san is still the same with some good growth, and Yume is shown as more dependable.The plot is good, nothing that shatters the light novel as a genre, but nobody reading this series should expect that. The change of setting helped with the direction the plot went, and it was a nice change of pace.Overall if you were going to drop this series because the last two volumes were bad, give it a read and see that this volume is great.",

I like how writer Ao describes Haruhiro's inner thoughts, I find the uncertainty familiar to my own thinking, and it brings me joy that other people think like that also, and that others also go through all the psychological stages like happiness, depression, anxiety, will to live, to be someone better that you are, compare oneself to others that have more skill or 'talent', sometimes I feel like Haruhiro and someone is writing a book about me ;) It takes great skill to write such an interesting piece of art and I thank the writer for this joyous time of my life, when I can read and enjoy such a masterpiece.",
