The only problem I have is the adhesive that came from most likely an old sticker is tough to get off. But honestly I'm cool with that, I gotta have volume 7 though.",

The party's teamwork is better than ever. It's alright that they aren't on par with the greatest of the greats, their still awesome in my book. I love how nearly 1/4 of this book is one big brawl, kind of like the raid in one of the previous volumes. It just goes to show battles aren't won or lost in an instant. The author does a great job of showing the flow of the battle, and the turning points.",

Parts of me wish to see more growth within the group especially with Yume, Merry and Shihoru. But I\u2019m starting to grow fond of their relationship with the Tokkis.
