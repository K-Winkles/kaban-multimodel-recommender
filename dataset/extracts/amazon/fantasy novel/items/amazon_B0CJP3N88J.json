That is THIS book for me. THE NIGHT MARKET by Jesikah Sundin is a romantasy like no other. This is a childhood friends-to-lovers forbidden romance with fated mates, trickster fae, the most adorbs forest friend familiars, and heavy folklore woven into a #superbingeable novel that I could not put down. Jesikah is a master wordsmith and every detail has a beautifully intricate meaning to it. I cackled, cried, yelled, swooned, and felt ALL the feels from the very first line.This book follows shortly after the events of Bound By Ravens (which was also AMAZING), but you don\u2019t have to read that one to enjoy this delicious morsel (though you might miss some fun Easter eggs if you skip it).The world-building is spectacular as you are practically pulled into a caravan night market with all the gypsy goodness. Characters (both heroes and villains) are interesting, compelling, and utterly enthralling. The story is so unputdownable and will have you on the edge of your seat! I promise you will crave cake infused with happiness, the cuddles of an adorable forest creature or two, and be tempted to tickle the feathers of a gorgeous Raven lad. But don\u2019t take my word for it, run and grab this book!FAVORITE QUOTES (you guys, this was SO hard to pick!)I never refused cake. Or berries. Or handsome, dangerous lads with boyish smiles sweeter than honeyed icing.I ached for her to feel every singing beat of my heart. To freefall through a midnight sky that was made just for us and then know what it felt like to fly beneath the stars.I didn\u2019t want ale; I wanted to drink him in and him alone\u2014his beautiful, kind heart and vibrant soul, the smooth, hard lines of his sculpted body, the musical sound of his deep laugh, the heady, intoxicating taste of his lips.I had never wanted to be a drip of sweat so badly as the one rolling down his chest.",

                "reviewText": "Filena is known as a seer, one who can see other\u2019s futures. Years ago, her and her brother Cian escaped their abusive father and started a new life under the ownership of the Lonan\u2019s. Now Filena works at the West Tribe\u2019s Night Market. There she tells the future for those who pay coin. Every Night Market before opening a fae comes and visits Filena: Rhylen Lonan, a Raven Folk who Filena has fallen in love with. But with West tribes rules they could never be together. Besides she has seen his future, and he is soon to meet his \u2018true mate\u2019. Little does Filena know that she is actually Rhylen\u2019s true mate. He has known for a number of years and has courted her in secret. One night the Night Market catches fire and Rhylen saves Filena just in time. This set off a chain of events which leads Filena and Rhylen not only together but changing the way the raven folk have lived for centuries. The Nigh Market is a beautiful romantic fantasy that kept me wanting to keep turning the page to see what would happen next. Whether from the fun interactions between characters, the swoon worthy romance between the two main characters, or the interesting world building, I couldn\u2019t get enough of this story. The characters are wonderful to read about. I loved how animal loving and imaginative Filena was. She thought up the best curses, even if she didn\u2019t think she could cast them. Her interactions with her brother, Cian, were fun and sweet. They taunt each other and are they\u2019re for the other when needed most. I would have loved more of Filena and Glenna interacting as they were supposed to be the best of friends. Just seemed it more of Glenna with Cian than Filena page wise. The romance! Oh! The romance. I was squealing so much though the romance in this book. Filena and Rhylen are my new favorite couple. The way Rhylen would do anything for Filena is beautiful to read. I also loved how the two would not fall into the trope of getting angry with the other for holding a secret. They thought through them logically. The treasure between them being buttons is so cute. If I could get another book of just them doing things together, I would be so happy! The world building in this is interesting. I liked how the raven folk live and love as a family. The class system and traditions were interesting to read about, and I wish the book went into more detail. I also liked the mentions of Seren, the city present in the pervious novel Bound by Ravens. But luckily you don\u2019t need to have read it to understand this story at all. But if you have fun finding Easter eggs though out the story. In closing the Night Market is a great book with hilarious characters and a swoon worthy romance. So, if you like great character interactions, beautiful romantic scenes, great world building, and racoons who love to steal gloves, the Night Market is the read for you. I give this book a four out of five!",
