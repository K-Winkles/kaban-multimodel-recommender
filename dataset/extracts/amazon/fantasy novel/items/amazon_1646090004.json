                "reviewText": "WARNING: There are potential spoilers ahead, but I am attempting not to be specific with them. Hopefully you are here reading the reviews because you\u2019ve played the game and are looking for the \u201ctrue\u201d ending. You\u2019ve found it.ALSO WARNING: This is long. TL;DR at the bottom.Final Fantasy XV began production when I was a teenager. I purposely did not do any research on the game before it was released. I wanted a completely fresh experience with no bias except that it was going to be awesome simply because of Square Enix being Square Enix.I was not disappointed.When the game released in November of 2016, I did the \u201cnormal\u201d thing and took a week off work to experience the entire story from beginning to end at my leisure. One of my best friends actually bought this game for me as a birthday gift, being that my birthday is in November. My wife did NOT take a week off work, so I was able to play this game entirely by myself.Big mistake.One thing I\u2019ve been doing with my wife over the past several months thanks to COVID-19 is replaying some of the great games that actually left an impact on my life. Final Fantasy XV is one of them, but I haven\u2019t started it yet due to it being both long and extremely emotional (for me, anyway). My wife didn\u2019t cry one bit at the end of FFX, so I assume she must be a sociopath or something. Anyway, watching me play the games of my past has helped my wife to better understand me as a person and to get a glimpse into my nerdy side. I can be anyone to anybody, but I can only be myself with my wife. It\u2019s both wonderful and embarrassing at the same time. That\u2019s one reason we haven\u2019t started this game yet.I can count on one hand the number of games that I feel do justice to portraying fatherhood. Final Fantasy XV is at the top. I was not a father at the time of this game\u2019s release, but I learned early on to take lessons in parenthood from every source available. And yes, that includes (some) video games. Let me explain:The way the development team displays the relationship between King Regis and Prince Noctis is subtle. Regis knows exactly what is going to happen to his son, and he knows it\u2019s the right thing to do (or rather, let happen). But that doesn\u2019t make it one single bit easier on Regis. In fact, it makes it harder. If there were another option to \u201cending the crisis\u201d of the world, he\u2019d take it in a heartbeat. Instead, Regis sent Noctis out into the world knowing full well what would happen to him. Instead of being depressed and remorseful, Regis took pride in Noctis, even though Noctis literally had no idea of what his fate would be. Noctis viewed his father with respect and love, and the events that took place after his departure from Insomnia would only serve to bolster those feelings.What the hell does this have anything to do with the book? Everything.I mentioned that Regis would have taken any other option presented to him in order to prevent his son\u2019s fate from happening. This book IS that option. But rather than Regis choosing it, Noctis did. And that shows how sometimes parents can be \u201crightfully\u201d wrong. Regis had accepted Noctis\u2019 fate, and he carried that weight since the moment of Noctis\u2019 birth. And instead of feeling sorry for himself, Regis chose to become the father his son would need, not his savior. In doing so, Regis taught Noctis how to become what his people needed, despite the pain of loss and heartbreak. He taught Noctis how to push through everything and choose the right path, even when that path deviated from the clearly-defined rules. Noctis went with his heart in his decisions, and it not only changed his fate, but the fate of everyone.When I joined the Army, my father kept his views to himself. I knew he wouldn\u2019t like it. Actually, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that my mother had sole custody of me and signed the release form allowing me to swear in (I was 17 at the time), I wouldn\u2019t have been able to. My dad didn\u2019t accept my decision. A lot of his friends went to Vietnam and never came home. He viewed the War on Terrorism the same way. That is, until he got over himself. He was never eligible for the draft due to a pre-existing medical condition (which I inherited, thanks Dad). He told me later on of the guilt he felt for not volunteering to go after his friends were \u201cvoluntold\u201d to. He told me he was jealous of my decision to join the Army because of the shame he felt in himself. I would never have guessed that, coming from him. My dad is tough, and he isn\u2019t the kind to talk about his feelings. But he did teach me to do the right thing, and I felt the right thing to do for myself was to serve my country. It\u2019s a feeling that less than 0.5% of our population actually acts on.I\u2019m a father now. I have two children, a boy and girl. My son is the eldest, and he\u2019s adopted. We brought him home from the hospital one month after he was born. His mother was addicted to drugs throughout the pregnancy, and he almost died because of it. He spent his whole first month of life in the ICU. You\u2019d never know looking at him today. My daughter is biological, and thankfully looks nothing like me. She\u2019s tough, like Dad. She and my wife both almost died during labor. I\u2019ve never been so scared in my life, not even when being shot at. And now my girl is taking her first steps. Both of my children had near-misses with \u201cfate\u201d, and neither one of them gave in.The original ending to FFXV was good. I was \u201csad\u201disfied. This book changed that. It made all things right in the end, and I hate that the production of the DLC was cancelled. The public deserved to play and experience the events that happened in this book, but at least we get to read about them. Yes, everyone really is happy in the end.I chose my fate, and I\u2019m still choosing it to this day. That\u2019s why I relate to Noctis. I am so proud of my children, and I\u2019d do anything in my power to protect them. That\u2019s why I relate to Regis. I\u2019ve held a lot of professional titles, and I\u2019ve been called many things. But by far, the best title I\u2019ve ever held and the best thing I\u2019ve ever been called is \u201cDaddy\u201d.TL;DR: Stop reading, buy it. Worth every penny. Those with minor annoyances such as typos and \"loose ends\" can get the Starscourge for all I care.",

                "reviewText": "The first 25% mostly rehashed the Ep Ardyn DLC, though there's a few little tidbits. One thing I thought was hilarious was that while most of it was translated with the English version in mind (for example, Verstael has a distinct way of speaking in English), there are little bits where you can tell the Japanese voice actor was who it was written for.Example: Just imagine the English language version of Verstael letting out a \"shrill shriek\". I'd pay good money to hear that.When you read the book you can basically picture how the DLCs were supposed to go. This is the cutscene that was meant to be. This would have been the mini boss. This was the big end boss. Etc etc. You can definitely tell what was planned and I feel disappointed that we missed out on these DLCs. I would have loved to do Aranea's jumping and see Solara in action. Especially after Ep Ardyn - controlling Ardyn felt so good.Spoilers:For people who are worried about it like I was: no, Ardyn's character is not ruined. It stays true to his character to the end, just like you see in the game, without feeling the need to change him to make him necessarily a 'good guy'.I liked how they solved the ending with one having to fight Bahamut in the great beyond and one fighting him on Eos. I thought that was a clever way to end it, giving them both something to do that made sense for both characters.I think a few plot points got brushed aside and forgotten quickly, but overall I'm glad I got the book and I just wish we had actually gotten to play this. Some of this would have made for pretty epic gameplay. If you want to see where things would have gone, it's pretty good.",

Although action is not it's emphasis, those moments are told so that you can easily imagine what the gameplay, and even level design, would have been.I guess to some extent, I regret not getting the episodes themselves, but I'm still so glad that they published this book, because it really would've been a shame to have never known what could've been. I mean, who didn't want more Aranea, and the addition of Sol, and their relationship, only made Aranea that much better. And then Sol and Lunafreya's relationship make Luna that much better as well. Just great momentum the whole way through.With everything put together: Kingsglaive, the game and it's updates and expansions, and now this book, I really have to say that Final Fantasy XV is among my favorites from the iconic series. Flawed as it may have been at launch, I can't help but feel like every flaw in it is more than made up for by some other aspect I adore.",

However, the book is VERY well written, it tells four compelling narratives (Aranea's had me on the edge of my seat the entire time), and is an incredible follow-up to (what I'm sure) what would have been mediocre season 2 DLC for the game. If you are interested in the concept ideas for said DLC or you were unsatisfied with the games ending proper, definitely give this book a read. For me personally, I actually can't wait to reread this book. With the game for context, I am certain this standalone will do quite well.",

It\u2019s a good and easy read and it was great to see the characters I love back in action.Recommended to all those Final Fantasy 15 fans! I got mine via Amazon Kindle.",

Tamb\u00e9m se fala de ardyn.... No final tem algumas p\u00e1ginas de ilustra\u00e7\u00f5es mas s\u00e3o poucas (foto em anexo das p\u00e1ginas finais). \u00c9 um livro pra quem realmente esta interessado na leitura das dlcs. Produto original com o menor pre\u00e7o (130) que vi no brasil. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel retirar a luva de papel e a hardcover tem a mesma ilustra\u00e7ao. Esse livro esta sendo vendido por quase 20 dolares na amazon.us, ficou mais barato que importar e pagar em dolar, estou muito feliz!!!",

                "reviewText": "Este libro simboliza muchas cosas, pero sobre todo, la pena que es que un Final Fantasy que tiene una buena historia, unos buenos personajes y un gran potencial, se haya visto abocado a un batiburrillo de merchandising para poder comprenderlo.El libro recoge el contenido que deber\u00eda haber salido en forma de los 4 \u00faltimos DLC del videojuego: el de Ardyn (que fue el \u00fanico que llego a producirse), el de Aranea, el de Lunafreya y el de Noctis (estos 3 \u00faltimos fueron cancelados porque el director se larg\u00f3 del proyecto). La narrativa, como es de esperar, no es la propia en s\u00ed de una novela sino que sigue una l\u00ednea muy adaptada para el medio del videojuego.Aqu\u00ed se profundiza en personajes que se tocaron en el juego principal de forma muy superficial (como Aranea o Lunafreya) y a su vez, narra la l\u00ednea temporal que llega a una de las secuencias post-finales que m\u00e1s desconcertante fue en el juego base (el final feliz).Si quieres entender buena parte de algunos personajes y una parte muy importante de la trama, es de obligada lectura puesto que el juego con el contenido actual est\u00e1 incompleto. Pero esto a su vez hace, que si quieres entender esta novela, tienes que jugar al videojuego por obligaci\u00f3n. No es un libro de expansi\u00f3n de lore, ni spin-off, ni precuela, ni secuela. Son DLCs can\u00f3nicos que contienen trozos de historia principal trasladados a texto.",
