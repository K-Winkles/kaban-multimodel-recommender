                "reviewText": "K. O'Neill has done it yet again! They are my favorite middle grade author. The Moth Keeper is an adorable graphic novel about Anya who is the new moth keeper. It is a very important job in her village. She has to protect the lunar moths that help the Night-Lily bloom once a year and they collect the pollen. It may be an important job but it is a lonely job. The moths are far and she must make the venture at night leading to her feeling isolated. When thoughts about living in the sun come up and Anya is obsessed with the idea. She decided to stay awake and see how it is in the day time. This decision has great affect on the Lunar Moths and the night village.I love that O'Neill always included LGBTQ+ rep in her novels, amazing art work, and has a clear meaning to the story. They take real world topics and break them down in a digestible way for a younger generation. I also really enjoy they put a blurb in the back about the inspiration for the novel and the history behind it.",
