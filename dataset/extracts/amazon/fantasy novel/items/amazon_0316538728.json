                "reviewText": "Lady Camembert wants to live her life on her own terms. She doesn\u2019t want to be forced to marry a man, especially since she isn\u2019t attracted to them. After her father paces away, she journeys to the Kingdom of Fromage to start her life over as Count Camembert. While she is supposed to keep a low profile, she instead finds herself befriending Princess Brie and developing a crush on her as their friendship grows.This was an adorable graphic novel about finding yourself, true love, grilled cheese, friendship, and doing the right thing. Brie and Cam\u2019s relationship was complicated because of the status difference, Cam\u2019s hidden identity, and the pressures of parents. Their friendship was so beautiful and I loved seeing them crush on each other and struggle with the pressure and their different fears. The break up they faced just made their relationship so much stronger and I love how it pushed Brie to fight for changes in her kingdom. Just everything about Cam and Brie\u2019s relationship was just so beautifully written and illustrated.Overall, this was a beautiful story and a beautifully illustrated graphic novel that does a great job at commenting on wealth, identity, power and privilege, especially on how it affects women differently. If you are looking for a YA queer graphic novel that has a lot of cheese references, definitely check this out.TW: death of a parent;",

This graphic novel has shot up to being in my top 5 favorites, maybe my #1 favorite-- it joins the ranks of The Prince and the Dressmaker, Heartstopper, and Laura Dean Keeps Breaking Up with Me in writing level, emotional strength, and memorable-ness. It explores sexuality, romance, gender, expression, societal pressures in a way that is humorous and relieving in some ways, and heartbreaking in others. The characters are brilliantly, heartwarmingly, painfully realistic. I found myself cackling out loud and tearing up throughout the story. As soon as I finished reading it, I wanted to read it all over again. I will cherish this book, and terrorize all my friends and family into reading it. I wait in excitement for the next amazing story the author, Deya Muniz, writes next!!",

                "reviewText": "This book brought pure joy into my eyes. \"Count Camembert\" will be a favorite character for years to come, and my daughter and a good friend both promptly snagged the story and loved the heck out of it too. For kids who need to be seen, for people who love a classic farce tale and great storytelling, unique and beautiful illustrations, and memorable characters, this one's for you.The inheritance laws in England were ever ridiculous and misogynistic, and one father's creative way of getting around them leaves his grieving daughter with her home, fortune, and a loyal servant after his passing. Though staying under the radar is the best way to move forward, when the \"count\" crosses paths with the wonderful Princess Brie and finds a friendship and chemistry that defies conventions, all bets are off.I'll admit to not really getting the cheese theme, but I know there's meaning behind it, and the author went all out to embrace it and add layers of delight to the tale. And the ongoing impulse to eat grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch and dinner is an added bonus.HEA, secret identity, historical, FF romance. An utter delight of cheesy goodness. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "My GF and I have wanted to read this book together for a while. As we expected, the art was great, but the story was very loose. So, to begin, the issue in the plot is that they live in an old fashion era that could repriment and ban their relationship BUT there are many not-funny moments when they are surrounded by modern things like switches and when they were wearing modern pajamas. I don't know. That was off putting. We also didn't find it funny. So...that was and odd desition. Besides that, there was a lot of girl boss exposition to believe that the protagonist really had an issue. Like, they did so many girl boss things that when they said 'ah yes but we wouldn't be able to be together' is like...that doesn't feel like the rules of this world. Besides that, something I didn't like as much was that the protagonist didn't work for their happy ending. It was rather their friends pushing them to be together. That made me feel disatisfied with the ending. I feel that it stole empowerment and ownership from the protagonists. Like, there is this boring guy thing that I guess was supposed to be the one to defeat and it didn't work because honestly he hasn't done anything bad but being boring. When he proposes it was kinda poorly constructed so when she humiliated him feels kinda bad. Like oh yes he deserves it because he is a man kinda thing (overdone in sapphic books). Plus, for a romantic book...they didn't even tell each other they liked each other first. That is like ... A big revelation in romance but...it wasn't them. It was Ricotta. So in those terms many plot desitions felt underwhelming... Even for a light romance that is supposed to be funny, these were key moments that felt poorly constructed.",
