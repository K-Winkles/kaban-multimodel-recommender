                "reviewText": "Voramis\u2019 assassin for hire is a master of arms and disguise. No one knows his true face. Armed with a soul-stealing dagger, the legend of the Hunter inspires fear, and yet he shelters and tends to the poorest and the sickly of Voramis. For years, he has avoided the Bloody Hand crime syndicate, but times have changed, and the crimes against the innocents of Voramis are growing steadily worse. In one night, they take everything from him. Now, the Hunter is out for blood, and everyone in the way of his vengeance, be it human or demon, must be cut down.From the very first paragraph, the reader gets shoved into the action and it doesn\u2019t let up. The author has such a vibrant writing style that the sentences just flow off the pages seemlessly at an alarming speed. The world was focused on the city of Voramis with its slums, markets, rich quarters, and palace. The worldbuilding though was far more extensive, especially as the book progressed, detailing the history of the religion and the origin of demons. All of it was very immersive. Especially all the sensory details. This book has to have the most potent olfactory use that I\u2019ve read to date, which helped to not only imagine this world better but to establish an important aspect about the Hunter. And beyond all that was the fun and disconnect from the real world I had while reading it.I did worry early on that the Hunter would be a Marty Sue type character because he is just so fantastic at everything between such traits as acting perfectly on cue in each of his disguises, his unparelled fighting skills, and not particularly struggling, but then around 30% in, the Hunter\u2019s vulnerability comes out : weaknesses and internal struggles aplenty. From then on, the character grew and I got attached.4.5 \u2b50 rounded upHonestly, if you love non-stop action in your reading with demons, cutthroats and world-ending threats, this book will deliver for you !",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The Hunter is Peloquin's John Wick, and Voramis is his King's Landing",
                "reviewText": "Peloquin has achieved the impossible: dragging my rent and bloody heart through 750 pages of pure heartbreak only to leave me grinning like a fool through the final pages. Yes, heartbreak. Darkblade: Assassin is not for the squeamish, and every twist and turn of The Hunter's tale is bound to leave shredded pages or bent plastic (for you Kindle readers) beneath your white knuckles. Let's dive into this dark fantasy masterpiece.The Hunter is one of the three pillars of power in the festering sore that is Voramis. King Gavian might rule in broad daylight, but a vicious criminal syndicate, the Bloody Hand, owns everything else. The flesh trade, the brothels, the black market. If it's worth even an offal-caked bronze drake, they have a finger in it.A tenuous peace exists between the Hunter and the Bloody Hand. He ignores their wanton degeneracy and corruption, and in return they give him free reign to carry out assassinations\u2014ones he is forced to execute to sate the ravenous bloodlust of a magical dagger inexplicably bound to him. It is not a tranquil relationship, but there is peace. For now . . .What follows is grim, bloody slaughter. Peloquin is a master of sensory storytelling, rooting you in the Hunter's unstable mind as he battles through reeking back alleys, incense clogged parlors, musty catacombs, raucous taverns, and elegant soirees. I cringed at every blow the Hunter struck and received. Tasted the coppery blood in his mouth and curled my noise up at the stench of death he was so Keeper-damned efficient at doling out. Every thrust, stab, slash, hack, chop, and any other method of dealing immense bodily harm was accounted for, and I reveled in the amount of detail I was being given.But for all Peloquin's emphasis on action, does his world-building and characterization suffer? Hardly. If anything, these are the true strengths of Darkblade: Assassin. In the middle of all the death, despair, and suffering, my favorite segment was three subsequent chapters that consisted of nothing but the Hunter and a side character talking about lore while climbing a seemingly infinite staircase. Peloquin's mythology is riveting. The talk of gods, demons, ancient civilizations, lost continents, frozen seas, forgotten wars, and alchemy could be ripped from the twitching muscles of this book and would still be fascinating on their own. Bravo, well done!And characterization? The Hunter is, quite frankly, a mess. But for all his brutality and bloodlust, he is a compelling, likeable mess. He must kill, but he chooses who, why, and when. Even in the midst of his long-term amnesia and despondence at the unending cycle of death and mayhem he must engage in, the Hunter has a code he follows. And, perhaps, even people he cares about. I fell in love with the brooding bloke, and my heart ached when the vicious Peloquin inflicted the unthinkable upon him.\"In these quiet moments, the Hunter became the prey, and he could never escape the lifeless eyes and accusing faces.\"This low point in the novel might receive criticism from other reviewers, but not from me. Depression is not something that evaporates with one minor success or simple kindness. Guilt and shame are not overridden by direction or purpose\u2014at least not entirely. They are ever present, like ghosts lurking just out of sight, waiting to drag us back down into the darkness at the slightest weakness or crack in our armor. The Hunter encapsulates this perfectly, and I applaud Peloquin for not shying away from these hard truths.I could gush for hours about this book, but the highest praise I can give it is this: read Darkblade: Assassin for yourself. It will hurt you. Yet, at the same time, it will also give you hope. Hope that we can rise above our heritage, our circumstances, and our past. Hope that we can be the light in the darkness; the good that doesn't yield to evil. And we don't have to be pure ourselves to take up that fight. We have all sinned, we have all fallen, but as long as we rise to our feet once more, we will never truly be beaten.Just like the bloody Keeper-damned Hunter of Voramis.",

Goes right along with the half and half nature of The Hunter. There's conflict everywhere, from his inner demons, literary, to the multitude of well done fight scenes. The fight t for the soul of the city and his own soul. Assisting, protector of the weak. I liked all of that and more. There's closure and the purpose for the next chapter in the story. Good read for sure.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to love this book. I really did. However, there are some things that keep me from giving it five stars. There are many moments through the 600+ pages that seem to drag on needlessly. I enjoy exposition to an extent and descriptive writing, but there comes a point when it becomes excessive (a la Stephen King at times). I could push past that. However, there is a great deal of repetition that litters the book. Internal battles within the main character are repeated, indicating little actual growth. The character seems to make repeated mistakes as well. It also feels at times that the author belabors the intended emotional impacts by repeating them as well. And the final conflict(s) are drawn out over multiple chapters to the point where it is exhausting. I can understand that the foe is meant to be nearly impossible to overcome, but it is done in a way that is not quite necessary. I don't want to call the writing amateurish or derivative, but it does come across that way at times, though the writing is done quite well on a whole. I think a bit of refinement could have turned this book into the blockbuster it has the potential to be. I do intend to continue the series as I am interested in the character and the story, but I do hope to see some growth in the composition of future novels as well as within the character himself. Definitely worth a read if you have the patience for it.",

                "reviewText": "Assassin is the first instalment of the Darkblade series. This book strikes you from picking it up as it has THICC boy status, with a nice page count that promises death and depth it hits on both accounts.This book starts off with a bang. A full blown atomic explosion of action which picks you up by the collar and drags you right into it. With a white-knuckled grip it then continues to guide you through the carnage and destruction that follows the Hunter.The Hunter reminds me mostly of Etzio Auditore. With a grand arsenals of weapons and an enjoyment for rooftops the character was easy to imagine from the get go. Just like Assassins creed the enjoyment and the fights are enjoyable all around. Scenes of this book would not be out of place reenacted by Micheal Fasbender on the big screen. What gives the Hunter depth, and changes him from a 2 dimensional killing machine, is the humanity Andy Peloquin is able to infuse into the very core of the character. A moral assassin, with inconceivable skill can only mean a bad time for the underworld of Voramis.Yet what if his moral compass is destroyed? If his moral north no longer guides him. What will the Hunter find himself contemplating with his morals in chaos?I followed this book up by reading the 0.5 Novella Life for a Life. With nice insights into some main series relationships it would be a perfect start to anyone thinking about Darkblade but wanting to test the waters before commiting to the 8 book series of awesomness that I\u2019m now enveloped in wanting to complete.Both Life for a Life and Assassin were hands down 5 Stars and an incredible time from the first page.",

Andy doesn\u2019t shy away from the gory details and is very good at creating that mysterious \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about this character but I want to read on and find out\u2019 kind of vibe.The story reminded me of a cross between Assassins Creed and that show Dexter. The \u2018hero\u2019 is more of an anti-hero, and (much like Dexter) the Hunter has this kind of moral code that he sticks to which justifies the ridiculous amount of blood he spills. I really enjoyed this aspect as well as his special weapon that harnesses the power of his victims and makes him stronger for it.100% recommend! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",
