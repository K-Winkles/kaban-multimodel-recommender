                "reviewText": "I loved the illustrations for this adaptation of Aru Shah and the End of Time! The colors were bright and eye-catching, and the pacing of the story was really good. After reading the book, I definitely enjoyed seeing illustrations of the characters and comparing those to the pictures I had in my head.I do hope that the rest of the series is adapted for graphic novels, too, because I would love to read those.As I have already read the sourcebook, I will include my review of that story below.:Aru lives with her mother in a museum of Indian artifacts. Since her mother travels quite often for her job, leaving Aru alone, Aru has developed a very active imagination. Exacerbated by the fact that she doesn't really fit in at school with the other students who are from very well-to-do families, she creates stories of trips she and her mother have taken and places they have lived that are much grander than the actual truth. Unfortunately, as typically happens when one stretches the truth a few too many times, some of her other classmates become suspicious and try to catch her in a lie. In an attempt to circumvent that potential disaster, Aru lights a lamp that her mother has warned her is cursed, and suddenly she is thrust into the middle of a quest to save the world - and she only has 8 days to do it.I loved this story. Though Aru's imagination does tend to get her into trouble, it also serves to get her out of trouble at times, too. The author did a great job of bringing the characters to life and, as they faced each challenge, they all grew, deepening their bonds with each other. The twists and turns that occurred, some of which I suspected and others that I did not, were all well-written. Even the ones that I did suspect were still somewhat of a surprise because I didn't fully guess what they would be.I think my favorite scenes are when Aru, Mini, and Boo meet with the Seasons and turn their own game back around on them, and when Mini and Aru finally get to the Hall of Weapons and discover that not everything is as it seems.",

                "reviewText": "I rated this 3 stars because the graphics were outstanding. But, the adaptation skipped some important parts. I felt this book was too rushed, and it didn\u2019t give me the vibe I was looking for. Already on the 3rd page, a part that should\u2019ve been a little more dragged out was already there! I was looking for a slower paced, enjoyable read. It went too fast in my opinion. Second, as I already said, they skipped important parts. At the end of the book you didn\u2019t really understand what happened, and why (Sleeper wasn\u2019t struck by the lightning bolt), if I hadn\u2019t already read the novel, then I would\u2019ve been confused as a reader of this graphic version of it. Another part they skipped was when they met Valmiki. They skipped many parts that would make this graphic adaption better than it is right now. If there is a second graphic novel of the second book in the Aru Shah series, I really hope they take my feedback into account. It would be much better.",

                "reviewText": "First I'd like to say screw my imagination cause this artwork is amazing!!! Kidding, Imagination is very good for the mind and soul but the work in this is so good! I love the Aru Shah series so, of course, I had to get my hands on this. Also the way I imagined the Sleeper way differently than the one shown here. Like I had pictured some random dude but the one picture in here is HOT! Forget my imagination I need to read more graphic novels!Thank You Disney Publishing for the copy!!!",

                "reviewText": "This graphic novel version of the first book of the Pandava Series gives readers a dynamic new glimpse into Aru Shah\u2019s world! I think this is a great way to introduce a new set of readers to the Roshani Chokshi\u2019s series based on Hindu tales\u2013it incorporates all the important elements of the story, and the full color artwork is superb! I would still encourage kids to pick up the original books because this version doesn\u2019t showcase Choksi\u2019s gorgeous writing style and we lose out a bit on some of the humor from the books (especially when it comes to the character of Boo the pigeon). But this would be a great way to get kids interested in the story or for readers who already love the books to experience them in a new way!",
