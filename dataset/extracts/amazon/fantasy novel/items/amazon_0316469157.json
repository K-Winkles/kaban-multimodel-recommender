The main character's struggle to do everything in their power to avert disaster but stay true to their bonds was heartbreaking but made me admire them so much more. I love League lore, just going through the story and recognizing elements from the game and other stories was super fun. Book confirmed just how deep these characters actually are and how they're more than just mascots, they're people with their own beliefs and values clashing against each doing what they believe is right. Don't think you even need to be a League fan to enjoy it, just a good story for anyone to get invested in.",

I was hesitant at first because I don't know too much about the lore of LoL, but it turns out that you can pick this book up without a familiarity with the LoL universe. It is a very epic story that will keep you hooked and wanting the answers hidden in the next page just as much as the characters in the book. I highly recommend this book. Great job to the author Anthony Reynolds.",

Young, arrogant and narcissistic, Viego's reckless decisions have put Camavor at a risk the empire has yet to conquer. When Isolde, Veigo's wife, becomes dangerously ill, Kalista sets out on a journey for a fabled cure. Meeting various helpful allies and various, unexpectedly, vengeful foes, Kalista finds herself torn between standing beside the only family she has left or doing what is right for the empire that her ancestors have built.",

                "reviewText": "This book reminded me a lot of the Mistborn books by Branden Sanderson. Ruination even called a specific relic space \"The Well of Ages,\" which feels like a mix of the \"Well of Ascension\" and \"Hero of Ages\" from Mistborn. Ruination is a political fantasy, but also a character-driven fantasy. You are introduced to various characters, follow how they react to different situations and other characters, and a progressive overarching story that involves them all reaches a climax in part three. The writing style flows without being too high-brow and not too young/childish either. If you're a fan of fantasy that isn't overly pretentious, you'll like this book. If you are a League of Legends lore fan, you'll like this book. Highly recommended, and there better be a sequel that builds on the Sentiel storyline. Senna and Lucian, anyone!? And Vennix should be a playable character - just saying!",

Necrit's homage.His true role was not what I was expecting. I don't want to speak for Necrit in how he might feel about his character or his role in crafting the character in this novel but ... I would be a little offended due to the dedication he has for the lore of this game. His role was a bit dull in the beginning and then confusing when big events occurred.Other than that, the book confirmed my thought that Viego is a spoiled boy in a pronged crown and proved to me that Kalista deserved better and so much more. I hope that there's more to the Ruination story to come. A conclusion with the next generation would be nice.10/10, would recommend.",

This book blew me away with the details of the events that lead up to the Ruination; an event that has intrigued me for a long time, and it's captured so well from start to finish. Because of this I have stronger attachments to some of the characters, a better understanding of how some came to be, and desperately wish for more novels in this franchise to appear.You know how you have an established franchise where you know what's going to happen, so you read a book about it and you feel dread knowing what's coming and there's no way to stop it? That's how I felt reading this book, and I loved it!",
