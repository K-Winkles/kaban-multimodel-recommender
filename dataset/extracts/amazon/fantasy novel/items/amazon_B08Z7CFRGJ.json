Yume and Ranta are back in action with the team with their new skills, the Tokkis returning with their usual antics, and Renji's team with much more characterization this time around. Everything came together and I couldn't put the book down. The action, the banter, and the team dynamics felt so nostalgic but also fresh.It's hard to believe that it's been at least 3-4 years for Haru and his team since starting in Alterna, and their growth has immensely shown. I can't wait to see the resolve continue into the next volume. Hopefully it won't be a long wait!",

                "reviewText": "This Volume felt almost like the opposite of the previous one which I must admit, I barely recall due to the lack of meaningfulness. Whereas the previous Volume had an abundance of calm walking and reflective sections but little fights, this one had long protracted fights and short reflective ones, which I cannot say left me any more satisfied.The adventure through the castle was almost tediously long. While I have always enjoyed the slow pace of this series, I must say the balance between meaningful fights and social interactions has somewhat been lost on me. It felt like a long run. The long journey was occasionally filled with small breaks which more often than not were filled with the characters' idiosyncrasies which, after 16 volumes, have finally started to grate on me. Yume's mix ups of common phrases followed by another character's pointless attempt at correcting her, Inui's stubborn obsession with a female character... While it is not wrong to include these in each volumes to remind us of the way a character is but the frequency of it is a bit too much. Repeating the same thing in short succession feels too forced and unnatural. Having said that, there were touching moments that remind us that growth and moving forward can mean leaving something (or someone) behind.The best part of the book to me were the short stories at the end which I found to be the best written parts of the book. Little to no unnecessary comedic relief but true insight into the characters and real demonstration of growth especially on Ranta's part. We also got to delve a bit more into Renji which I hope we get more of in the coming volumes. The fear of the end keeps growing within me but with the re-apparition of Shihoru, I feel there is yet more to discover...",
