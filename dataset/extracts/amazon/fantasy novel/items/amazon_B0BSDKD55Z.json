        "description": "Explore its many rooms, pick something nice off the shelf, and have a little read by the fire at the Cozy Quill Bookshop.Running from strife in her homeland, Maribella Waters becomes the new owner of the fabled Cozy Quill. After finding squatters on her property, she employs Asteria Helsdottir, a giant, barbarian warrior woman more accustomed to swinging an axe than opening a book. Together, the odd couple must make a success out of the bookshop\u2014and survive a dizzying procession of seasonal festivals.But the local evil noblewoman has other plans in mind. Threatened with being run off the land, Maribella and Asteria must use their wits to outsmart Lady Malicent and keep their business open. Along the way, the whole town lends a hand, and friendships are forged . . . along with a few secrets revealed.The Bookshop and the Barbarian is a low stakes, comedic and cozy fantasy with a slice-of-life, sapphic romance. It is about the celebration of books, autumn and winter, community, friendship, and unexpected romance. And it is also very patiently waiting for you to pick it up and read it.",

This story is well written, its length is digestible and its full of a quirk that fans of the Fable video game series would come to appreciate. References abound in this lovely Sapphic jaunt and my heart is made better by having read it. Thank you gloriously Morgan Stang! I LOVE \"THE BOOKSHOP AND THE BARBARIAN\".",

Or as much as I can without spoiling it.Maribella Waters buys a bookshop in the middle of a small town called the Cozy Quill. The building is full of books, a maze of rooms, boarded up doors, and so forth. How could she pay for such a wonderful bookshop? She got lucky.Then there is the barbarian Asteria Helsdottir who she needs to hire for reasons. Why is the barbarian in the town? Reasons.Both have backgrounds they don\u2019t seem to wish to talk about. And there are some issues they have to overcome. But I\u2019ll leave that for you to discover. There IS a lot of fourth wall breaking. And any threat is quickly overcome.There are a few cultural references. The author hints at Minecraft. And there is a even reference to Legends & Lattes.But this story isn\u2019t anywhere as involved as other fantasy novels. It is 187 pages yet I could of finished it in a day.Anything in the book was put there to help solve the problems. Or not. There is a few scenes which went in a totally different way than I thought they would. But there are a few scenes which you could have seen from the start. Four out of five. I enjoyed but never really found it that funny. It felt forced.",

Before proceeding to go and pick it up and continue reading. This book was, in a word -for me- infuriating. I haven't vented, complained, and whined about a book so much in my life. Freakin narrators that can't read minds, have too many bosom metaphors (even with the limit), and dare to suggest they exist in the same world that one of my favorite books exist. The Audacity! I mean truly. How dare it!That all being said it was entertaining. It held my attention. Despite the nonsensical narrator it was interesting and well written. It had references I caught (hate the hills short story as a side) and more I probably didn't. I respect the author for having the courage to write this book and share it with the public. Honestly this probably deserves 5 stars but I'm giving it 4 because I'm a spiteful little monster. Right now is my 6 months to rage!Who knows, maybe I'll torture myself and read it again someday...",

                "reviewText": "This book is very polarizing in reviews, because it has a lot of parts, esp the humor, that you either dig or you don\u2019t. Well, I dug. It has a sort of \u201cwritten to market\u201d feel, but it\u2019s like that market is specifically me. The comparison to Legends and Lattes is very obvious and there\u2019s a lot of nudge-nudge wink-wink about d\u2019n\u2019d type tropes, references, and memes. Also one reference that feels like it was plucked right out of this sub. The fourth wall is practically non-existent and the narrator often talks to the reader. That\u2019s all stuff that I\u2019m sure can fall flat for a lot of people but I found it hilarious and had to send screenshots to all my friends.It\u2019s a short book, I read in almost half of it in one go, and it was funny and light, great for taking my mind off my regularly scheduled evening anxiety. I haven\u2019t even played that much d\u2019n\u2019d but I am a sucker for tabletop rpg parody bits and found them super fun.The main character felt very much like a reader insert. Yes, I would love a huge bookshop fully stacked and reading by the fire to my tall muscular barbarian-hired muscle (in this situation repeating muscle a few times in a single sentence is warranted, trust me). She\u2019s alright as a character, very sensible at times, and has a mysterious past she\u2019s hiding.The barbarian is lots of fun. She\u2019s got that super direct \u201cyou people are weird let\u2019s just fight it out\u201d vibe and always considers violence the best option.The plot was nice and low stakes, lots of book reading, being cozy, a sprinkle of arch-nemesis and getting to know the townfolks, which were alll pretty fun characters.",

Never in my life a book made me laugh like this one. I enjoyed every second of it, mainly because of the way you\u2019re able to fall in love with the little village, the bookshop and ALL of the characters, and also because of the way the author gets in between the story and their sense of humour which gives the book a silly (but cozy) atmosphere",
