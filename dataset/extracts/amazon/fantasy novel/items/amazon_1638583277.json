                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Unhinged and unsatisfying",
                "reviewText": "Let me start off by saying I actually really do like this series, and I am not trying to be mean. I did still enjoy the book. This review contains my opinions, I do not mean to offendSo, first off, what was up with this volume? It just felt so jumbled and frankly the words that come to mind are 'useless filler.' For a 10 book long series point in one direction, romance, in my opinion the payoff was attrociously undercut. Like, wow, we get the wedding that we all knew was coming since literally book one. Except it's done in 3 pages.. how is that even a remotely satisfying payoff to the story?Second, if the after notes, the author says he/ she tried to wrap up all the loose ends but then right before there's a whole discussion between two gods that just left me sitting there thinking \"..huh. So what's up with that?\" That's a whole new storyline that just got pushed in for no reason. Let alone the fact the author brings up a whole new love interest in the last 10 pages and just drops it. You could call it a \"leave it to your imagination\" thing but going back to the author saying he/ she was tying up loose ends, it just seems like bad writing to me that betrays what they said.Third, what's with the wedding? Like, glad they actually had it, but where's Tisalia and Arahnia? Also, the 3 page thing, but I already stated that.Fourth, why shove this whole arc in a tiny book of (~)160 pages and only really deal with the main events over the course of maybe 40 of them? I'm not one to want to stretch things out unnecessarily, but this should've been at least a 200-page book. If not, it could've been a 300-page book with how much stuff was going on.Sigh.Anyway, I still did enjoy it, like I said and I am glad that the series got a proper (if you call it that) ending. A happy one at that.Imo the series needs another SOLID book to seem even remotely close to wrapped up, if not definitely two. It'd be a shame to have this good of a story wrapped up like that.",
