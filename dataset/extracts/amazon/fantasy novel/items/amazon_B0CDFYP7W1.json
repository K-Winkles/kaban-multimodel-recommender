They take the necklace & leave her to be arrested after she is immobilized with a spell after unlocking the jewelry case. After being locked in her cell for several hours, she has a visit from the Headmaster of RSI, the Radcliffe-Stone Institute for Troubled Youth with an offer for her to enroll at their school or stay in jail to face the consequences of her attempted thievery. She decides to go to RSI not understanding what the school is actually training her to become. This is was an interesting, enjoyable read for me. I plan to read book 2.",

From the blurb and the cover I had assumed she would be in her older teens, not younger teens. However, I did still enjoy the story. There was enough humor, twists, interesting side characters, and a fast paced plot to keep me engaged. I still would've preferred to have an older fmc, plot wise I think there could've been more directions to go in had she been older. But it worked at the age the fmc was given, it just took me longer to connect to her character. Overall, I did enjoy the book. And I wouldn't be opposed to reading a sequel.",

It was easy to be invested in the characters and it was nice how it tied into the overall Gryphon Rider series. The one thing I had an issue with really was the cover. The image of the girl appears to be early twenties while the protagonist is thirteen. It threw me off at the beginning but that aside, thoroughly enjoyed this book.",
