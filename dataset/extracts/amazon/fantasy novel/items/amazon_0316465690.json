                "reviewText": "This story felt like a homecoming to me, as strange as that may sound. Reading about Sabine and Elodie felt like finding a shard of myself embedded in a fantasy world. I could relate to Elodie as the oldest sibling, trying to do what\u2019s right for those younger than her, and Sabine as a person who sometimes struggles with emotions. I adored the way their characters were written, specifically in their interactions with each other. Sabine\u2019s power comes from her endlessly empathetic heart, and Elodie\u2019s comes from her strategic mind, making them the perfectly balanced duo. Their romance is delightful to follow, because they are such different people who somehow manage to understand each other through the language of desperation. Adrienne Tooley was already an instant-buy author for me, but The Third Daughter absolutely confirmed this decision!I am going to be raving about The Third Daughter for many months to come! I cannot wait for the second book in this duology, which according to Goodreads is going to be called \u201cThe Second Son\u201d!My Recommendation-If you love magical sapphic fantasy novels with well-written worlds and characters, you need to grab a copy of The Third Daughter right away! I would especially recommend this book to fans of Gravemaidens (because of the high-fantasy apothecary elements in the story) or Girl, Serpent, Thorn!",

                "reviewText": "This is a story about two young women: the daughter of a queen who feels cheated of the crown and the power that could have given her, and the daughter of an apothecary, who makes their potions more potent with her stored tears. This world is set where there was once a maiden, one who wouldn\u2019t show up until a third daughter of a third daughter. The third daughter was born to the late queen, and then she was brought up by her father who says he gets visions from the original maiden.When trying to keep the kingdom out of the church\u2019s hands, and with the help of the apothecary\u2019s daughter, the jilted princess puts the maiden in a sleep she can\u2019t wake her from. Now the two make a deal to try and learn how to wake the sleeping queen and maybe learn some truths along the way.The story is mostly a solid four-star, complicated but not as much as it seems to think it is. It has characters betraying each other, and making plans, but it\u2019s like the princess never really considered what to do until she\u2019s impulsively trying to get power back from the chamberlain. I get that her mother\u2019s death was sudden, but while the chamberlain schemes, she just seems to react. Still, the story is fun, though the revelations are easy to guess.The thing that really drives this down to a 3.5 for me is the ending, which I can\u2019t really talk about in-depth as that would be spoilers, but basically, the ending is only twenty-percent actually wrapping up the book, and mostly bringing in a character I didn\u2019t care about because they were in the past, trying to make me care, so that I\u2019d care about the sequel. It\u2019s actually really annoying how much the ending just feels like a setup for the sequel. Like, I don\u2019t care this isn\u2019t a standalone book, but the amount of things that just feel left to the wayside because \u201cit\u2019s for the sequel\u2019 is insanely disappointing, and maybe would work for me if I had the second book immediately to read, but now means that I\u2019ll probably forget this book way before the sequel is released, and makes me just not care.So yeah, a fairly interesting book until the last but where I just feel sequel-baited and disappointed.",

The Third Daughter was my top read for the month of July and it\u2019s one that I will be widely recommending in my book groups and to my library users.The world building and character development were amazing. Elodie and Sabine are both interesting and complex characters. I love the way the author allowed us to get to know each of them individually before bringing them together. I\u2019m not a huge romance reader, so I loved that the romantic elements were slow-burn and a more minor part of the story. The character and world development take up a lot of the first half of the book, but I really enjoyed that because it allows me to more fully immerse myself into the characters and the story. I\u2019m really looking forward to reading other works by this author in the future.",

                "reviewText": "I couldn't put this book down, and when I absolutely had to for sleep and adulting I was cursing life because I just wanted to sit down and finish reading it.It's a story about two girls from very different walks of life who are destined for more than either of them could have dreamed.Sabine and her sadness. Elodie and her fierceness.The way the bonds of friendship was written gripped my heart, it reminded me so much of the bond I share with my best friend.The storyline itself was beautifully paced, and the way the worldbuilding is written astonishes me, it's like I've always known this world and I was being reintroduced to it all as I read.I cannot wait to see what unfolds in the next book. I NEED IT IMMEDIATELY! \u21e2 Quotes I adored: \"It was disheartening, the way their endless work never quite paid off. The way life always demanded just a little bit more.\"\"But sadness is like a splinter. You've got to root around inside to find it. Hell to extract, but it's the only way you'll be able to properly heal.\"",
