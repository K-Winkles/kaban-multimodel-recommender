                "reviewText": "Briardark is a horror novel set in the Warhammer universe. Although one does not need to know anything prior to reading this, knowledge of the land, its people, and history will add to ones experience. Author CL Werner immediately begins to build this awesome story by adding constant dread, atmosphere, and a real sense of impending doom. This dark world building was great and one of the main compliments I can say about the writer. Weaving some rather shocking death scenes in what feels like an adult Grimm's fairy tale, Briardark takes many twists and turns with a great story gimmick that kept me reading late into the night. While some of the character decisions might seem naive at times, the intensity of the narrative overcame any minor criticisms I had. I am very much looking forward to reading more from this author and seeking out more stories in the Warhammer horror universe.",

                "reviewText": "CL Werner is my favorite author of Warhammer fiction. His original Witch Hunter novel is still my favorite and, I would argue, the best novel ever published by the Black Library.I feel like he's only been half-committed to what he writes for the BL since. This is no exception. The story is half-baked, the pacing is off, the characters act unbelievably stupid- not learning from their experiences and just repeating the same mistakes.The ingredients for a good Warhammer novel are here, but they aren't utilized correctly. If you're like me, you may enjoy it in the same way other people enjoy Hallmark movies: we know they're trash, but they scratch a particular itch for a narrative subject that we're interested in.",
