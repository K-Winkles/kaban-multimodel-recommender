We got a MC who thinks he is smarter than the rest of the world and everyone who don't agree with him are trash, but he is too haughty to ever explain his actions to anyone. For the first 'conflict' of the plot, two members embezzled money from the party and he just straight up sold them into slavery. It was premeditated intent. As he got the news, he had connected the thought of 'oh, they took my money' to 'I'm going to get my money back and make some more by selling them'. I can't root for a protagonist like that, so I give up on reading this story. If that sounds like your cup of tea, go ahead and read this book. Cheers.",

Slightly gritty too be not enough to be too dark,just enough to show to harsh reality in a fantasy world but still with strong characters. Excellent read, I recommend.",
