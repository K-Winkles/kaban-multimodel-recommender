It's a long, sometimes painful journey of gaining self-confidence, and you can tell it's written by an author who is living out a parallel life: Haruhiro-san and Ao Jyumonji are kindred spirits.As the saga progresses its sometimes tempting for me to complain at how little progress Haruhiro makes in terms of development, and his constant self-deprecation can get annoying (as well as annoying his comrades!), but then I remember that I am much like him, and remind myself that I would be no better in that situation.I've finished about ten of the books in the series so far, and things seem to be speeding up now. I can hardly wait to see if he finally gets a chance to pursue love...",

The party members mainly focused on goblin slaying in the Old city of Damuro in volume 1 and killing kobalds in the Cyrene mines in volume 2 while growing as a party and overcoming the loss of comrades. However, volume 3 takes a dark turn when the party decides to participate in a raid on Deadhead Watching Keep, a stronghold of orcs.Just as the events and battles that take place are jarring and abrupt, so too is the ending of volume 3. It is only a semi resolution leaving you wanting more. I can't say that this is truly a bad thing. It is endings like this that get me shaking with anticipation and wanting to immediately pick up the next volume in the series.",

Such great writing and compelling characters. I love this series.After we lost Monato I thought we were done with the tragedy aspect of this series. But like GRRM, Ao is not afraid to kill characters when it serves the plot and deepens the narrative.Outstanding series.

This book started off a bit slow like most of the grimgar series so far, but it was well warranted to adjust to what happens later in the book. This book showed different volunteer soldiers groups where each had something special to add to battle, and Haru's group is no exception. As far as combat and plot is concerned, this is my favorite book so far in the series.",
