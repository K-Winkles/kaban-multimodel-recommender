The information covers everything from coming up with a book title to marketing and publishing the final product. The information is comprehensive but presented in manageable, even bite-sized sections. That said, the book itself is not bite-sized. I didn't have a problem with the size, but anyone with shorter shelves should be aware that this is a tall book - but it makes use of the page size with both printed information and some great sketches for additional reference!Overall, I highly recommend this book for fantasy authors! It's a must-have in your reference book collection.",
