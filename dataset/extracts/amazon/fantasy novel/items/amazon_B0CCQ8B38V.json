                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Top Notch Slow-Burn with a Touch of Espionage",
                "reviewText": "How to Bite Your Neighbor & Win a Wager is a slow-burn romance novel by D.N. Bryn, that also happens to include side-plots regarding vampire rights and committing espionage against an evil pharmaceutical company.\u201cWesley didn\u2019t tell his legs to move, but neither did he tell his lungs to breathe or his heart to beat. They did so because they were born to, and he was born to run into Vincent\u2019s arms.\u201dThis quote occurs very late in the book, but I feel it perfectly describes the dynamic chemistry and slow burn relationship Wesley has with Vincent. Also, I didn\u2019t think it was possible for two characters to be so horny and yet so wildly oblivious.This book was fantastic. I got the horny, vampire fantasy that I bought the book for, but I also received the gradual build to a true, romantic relationship between Wesley and Vincent, as well as an enthralling mystery about the shady pharmaceutical company, Vitalis-Barron, that pretty much owns the town.Without spoiling anything, I want to touch on some key things I really liked about the book. For example, I really liked how morally grey Wesley\u2019s character is, as Kendall, his best friend, describes it. His whole character arc as well is very satisfying as he comes to terms with a lot of his trauma and learns to redeem himself.I liked all of the meta/self-referential moments in the book in the form of comics and video games, and how it was made a part of the world-building instead of being too jokey or fourth wall breaking. The same thing about the true villains, Vitalis-Barron - it wasn\u2019t too jokey, no \u201cdur-hur evil pharmaceuticals\u201d - no man these people are evil and have a deep rooted history in being evil, as most corporations do.The world-building and the politics about being a vampire in general and how vampires live on thin, marginalized lines on the edge of society was also incredibly well done. I love books that take classic vampire myths and decide what to keep and kill from them, as well as recontextualizing them with what it may look like today in a more modern society. Vincent\u2019s experience being a vampire and a semi-closeted gay man explores a lot of what that would look like, but also draws an excellent parallel that gives poignant insight on what it is like to be disabled and LGBTQIA+ in today\u2019s society. I\u2019m sure this was an on-purpose parallel done by the author, and it was incredibly well done.One more excellent thing D. N. Bryn does with the storytelling is how the miscommunication as a romance trope is executed in a way that is believable and moves the story along. Each character has an incredibly valid, albeit dubiously ethical reason to not tell each other what they really want to. I never once felt taken out of the romance, the intrigue, or the suspense of the plot by the miscommunication issues. It was so well done, I had to put the book down and calm down at the blowup/reveal point, because of how stressed out I was about it.Overall this was a fantastic book! I give it 5/5, and I can\u2019t wait to read D.N. Bryn\u2019s sequel to this, How to Sell Your Blood and Fall In Love, when it comes out.",

This story never had any flat/boring moments, I\u2019ve found myself entertained throughout the whole story. Vincent is really a cinnamon roll who deserves the world \ud83e\udd79\ud83d\udc95-Warnings for this story--Violence including manslaughter/murder-Medical experimentation (not conducted on main characters, in pointer view of characters, or detailed)-Non-consensual blood sucking-non consensual drug-induced sleep-Implied and contemplated semi-explicit sexual",

BrynPages: 396\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50~Vincent has had a tough four years, not only was he broke, basically homeless and clinging to a job where he's not even sure his boss likes him - he's also a vampire. Without the funds to sustain himself, but he found a solution, to break into houses and feed off humans that won't even realise what happens. That is until Wesley's house of course.Wesley wasn't sure what life had planned for him - but he was sure it wasn't living in an empty house and being fed on by a vampire. However, this can work in his favour if he plays it right.~Guys this book was sad, funny, beautiful and utterly charming. I enjoyed it so much and read it in one sitting. Vincent is honestly too pure for this world and deserves protection from everything and anything. Wesley is Vincent's perfect counterpart - strong, determined and emotionally fragile.Their slow start from strangers to friends to eventual lovers was done perfectly and fit into the plot seamlessly. Also THE PLOT - I loved it and it added the perfect hint of intrigue to this story.It was filled with action and scenes that broke my heart and left me in tears. But the author always made up for it with softer scenes and humour.I think this might have restarted my love for the vampire genre \ud83e\udd23 and I cannot wait for book 2 in this series!!!\ud83e\udde1",

Hay una trama detr\u00e1s que hace que la historia sea m\u00e1s interesante. Hay un giro que puedes intuirlo o no, pero que le da dinamismo y me gusta que los personajes tengan conflictos internos en algunas de las situaciones, sin duda, lo hace m\u00e1s cercano al lector.I just read it thinking that it was a romance between roommates, but is han been more. There is an plot that makes the story more interesting, it's not only a romance. Also, it has a little plot-twist, you can guest it or not, but makes the plot more dynamic.The characters are adorable and the have inner conflicts making them more reliable.",
