                "reviewText": "I'm now up to volume 11 of this series, and I'm a little torn between how to rate this. The first two volumes in the series and the story told between them is great. Later ones are up and down, mostly down.That said, what makes this series stand apart from other isekais is that it treats the battles as more realistic, with the main cast of characters not being overpowered -- even being underpowered compared to both the hostile creatures they come into contact with and their fellow \"volunteer soldiers.\" I think that gives the fights a bit more weight, and the stakes feel a bit higher than in a series like SAO or Danmachi. I'd say the overall atmosphere is pretty dour on account of that, though it's not without a few touches of comic relief.The characters feel very well fleshed out here, although your mileage may vary in later volumes as to whether they get more flanderized or don't develop enough.Anyway, I feel pretty good about recommending the first two volumes for this series, at least. The anime was also done pretty well, and its first season ends at the same place as this volume.",

The character's consciences (about killing other sentient beings even if they are \"monsters\") and emotions feel genuine. Maybe it's because I am of a similar age and have similar pesonal experiences that the author describes in their afterword, but the story and how it is told really resonates with me. I love how the characters are developing, and I like the direction the story is taking. I truly enjoy this series so far, far more than any other Light Novel series I have read previously.

The second volume gets to focus more on the new priest Merry and more details regarding her background.I feel that this novel had some good fight sequences, character development and strengthening of our favorite underdog party in Grimar. Some of te illustrations here were very well done and contributed greatly to the feel of the story.",
