                "reviewText": "The follow-up to Ninth House, Hell Bent tells the story of Alex Stern\u2019s determination to restore the Virgil to her Dante at Lethe. Lethe is ninth house introduced in the first novel, the oversight house at Yale University, where long standing tradition means that eight powerful houses, or societies, use the arcane and magic to alter reality or prognosticate or otherwise guarantee their alumni continue to live lives of privilege and prosperity. Lethe observes their rituals and workings to keep them both unobserved by outside eyes, and also undisturbed by the occult, any ghostly forces that would interrupt or play havoc with the magic integral to the ceremonies and rites being conducted in secret by these eight houses inside Yale University\u2019s venerable tombs and classroom buildings.Alex Stern\u2019s mentor at Lethe,Daniel Arlington, is sucked through a portal of some kind in the middle of the first book. With the assistance of Lethe\u2019s Oculus, Pam Dawes, Alex is determined to rescue Darlington and bring him home. The circumstances surrounding this random accident are suspicious and Alex isn\u2019t having it. Working against this goal are many obstacles, ranging from past to present. There\u2019s blowback from Alex\u2019s lurid and unsettling past as a strung-out teen in California; there\u2019s the distrust and resistance Alex and Dawes encounter from the adults in the Lethe organization, from the Lethe-liaison police detective with whom they worked to solve a murder in book one, Ninth House, to the faculty and university administrators within whose imprimatur they must work, who discourage investigation and sadly shake their heads and write off a young man\u2019s loss\u2014his assumed death\u2014as an unfortunate hazard of the job.Determined as Alex and the reluctant team of other characters who join the quest are to bring Darlington home, their objective becomes enormously daunting, nearly unthinkable, when it becomes clear that they must steal back Darlington\u2019s soul from hell itself, and that they won\u2019t be the first Yale students to make the trip to the underworld and back. What price will they pay to save Darlington, Lethe\u2019s \u201cgolden boy\u201d who was intentionally sucked into the demonic realm? The action is fast-paced, urgent, and suspenseful. It cost me as a reader to go slowly, to savor the story instead of devour it. This novel builds a rich and layered world with a strong central narrative objective (getting Darlington\u2019s soul back) which is further enriched by all sorts of extraneous and intertwined complications:\u2014like the reappearance of Eitan, the West Coast Israeli drug kingpin who ensures Alex\u2019s compliance in working for him by obliquely threatening her mom\u2019s well-being;\u2014like Alex\u2019s realization that the spirits of the dead, the Grays she\u2019s always seen, can speak to and through her and can even momentarily hijack her body to talk to living people;\u2014like the fact that human souls can be ripped out of bodies, and a such a body can return to the regular world, sans soul, to hang out in a warded circle in his childhood home, naked, beautiful, bearing glowing golden badges of demonic indenture, featuring horns, and a robust erection;\u2014like the fact that vampires actually exist(!);and\u2014like the inclusion of Alex\u2019s roommate, Mercy, who has not hitherto been aware of the magic suffused into the fabric of her university, into the elaborate Darlington rescue plan\u2014 all these twists and turns, make the story both more relatable\u2014life throws complications at us constantly, even when we are in the midst of Big Things\u2014and also more complex, lending the book the wonderful, fully-developed richness that readers so love and expect from Leigh Bardugo\u2019s novels.This second Alex Stern novel is an easier read than Ninth House, I thought, because the time line is relatively straightforward. I reread Ninth House before launching into Hell Bent (I often reread a novel before I read its sequel), and I was once again struck by Leigh Bardugo\u2019s use of a wildly fractured narrative time line. The reader has to piece together what has occurred to get to Alex\u2019s enrollment at Yale, then figure out Daniel\u2019s a sense and what caused it, and how the past has shaped him almost as much as Alex\u2019s has shaped her. Reading it feels disjointed, complicated, disassociated, something like being in a fugue state\u2014like waking up on a stained mattress and not knowing how one\u2019s best friend could be no longer alive, or how the room around one became splintered and wrong and littered with the blood-splattered remains of people one knew, all while one was apparently unconscious.I loved this novel, its predecessor, and I am eager to find out what happens next, though the wait for book three will no doubt be agonizing. I recommend this novel\u2014and this author\u2014wholeheartedly. Hell Bent is 100% great read.",

                "reviewText": "Hell Bent is the second, and (as of 25-Jun-2023) last published book in Leigh Bardugo's Alex Stern series. (There will be spoilers for Ninth House, so stop reading now if that is a problem for you.) These novels take place mostly at Yale University, and almost entirely in the neighborhood of New Haven, Connecticut, the city in which Yale is located. Bardugo graduated from Yale, where she was a member of Wolf's Head, one of Yale's notorious secret societies, and she is still associated with the university. This feeling of place and history is one of the best things about the books.The fantasy premise of the series is that the Yale secret societies, particularly the most prominent, which Bardugo refers to as \"The Ancient Eight\", conduct secret magical rites in order to enhance their wealth and power. Furthermore, because these rites are dangerous, there is an even more secret ninth house called Lethe, whose job is to monitor and police the Ancient Eight. Galaxy (Alex) Stern was recruited to Lethe at the beginning of Ninth House as its newest and most junior member and was given a full scholarship at Yale, because she had the ability to see ghosts.We learned in Ninth House that Alex's abilities go far beyond this. In fact, the book ends with a \"Yer a wizard, Harry!\" moment in which Alex's gift is named and defined in terms of a longer tradition. Alex is a Wheelwalker. She can communicate with the dead. More, she can take possession of the souls of both dead and living people.Hell Bent is a quest novel. Ninth House ended with Alex's senior and mentor Daniel Arlington (Darlington) being sent to Hell. Alex and her Lethe colleagues' quest is to go to Hell (thus, they are \"Hell bent\") and bring Darlington back. It's a great story and I thoroughly enjoyed it.At the same time, Hell Bent lacks something that made Ninth House special. It was clear to me as I read Ninth House that fantasy was only a transparent mask over real problems -- the exploitation of vulnerable girls and the barely licit means used by powerful people to perpetuate their power. Ninth House is scarcely a fantasy. Hell Bent, in contrast, is full-on fantasy. Although there are connections to reality, they are less central in Hell Bent. The moment in which Alex's superpowers were named really weakened the story, for me. Hell Bent is still, however, an excellent fantasy novel, even if it does not quite measure up to the outstanding Ninth House.While Hell Bent doesn't exactly end on a cliffhanger, it does leave some loose ends dangling. I am confident for this reason that Bardugo plans a sequel. Indeed, she has confirmed that she plans it to be a trilogy. I certainly intend to read it.",

The imagination of this writer to create a secret world of hell behind the living with a bent on the origin of vampires is intriguing.

The ninth house was good, although it took me a while to get into it, but the second book, (hell bent)....loved it, way better than the first.",
