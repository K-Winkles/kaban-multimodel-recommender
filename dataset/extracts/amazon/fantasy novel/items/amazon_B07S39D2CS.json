The style of the story is much like in the previous parts and I liked it even some of the short changes in point of view. For me they add depth to the world. I also like it despite some of the Japanese LN clich\u00e9s (eg instantly drunk after one glass of alcohol). Some of the bigger event parts were a bit confusing, too many names. Still, an entertaining addition to the series and looking forward to the next part.",

Band 3 f\u00e4ngt auf die gleiche Art an, aber der Ablauf ist zumindest nicht genau der gleiche und ab dem n\u00e4chsten Band k\u00f6nnte die Handlung etwas umschwenken, wobei der generelle Ton der Serie bisher gleich geblieben ist und das sicher auch weiterhin bleiben wird. Also: wer Band 1 und 2 mochte wird ohne Frage auch Band 3 m\u00f6gen.",
