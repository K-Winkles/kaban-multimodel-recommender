The artwork is AMAZING! I also really admire that the artist tried to keep the characters looking similar to how they did in the TV show adaptation (which I never watched, but I could see how fans of the show would appreciate the consistency). This is just such a great story, and it's amazing to see it adapted to a graphic novel. It really lends itself well to being made into a visual work of art. You will not regret this purchase! Even if you never read the novels, you don't have to in order to be a fan and appreciate this. The storytelling is great and covers all the main points.",

He was not merely the illustrator but, to use cinema terminology, the storyboard artist, director, cinematographer, production designer and acting coach. So, bravo to Christopher! (And the story's not bad either!)",
