Where a young girl must find her place and her family while trying to survive in a world built for men. As the daughter of the most powerful trader in the Narrows, the sea is the only home seventeen-year-old Fable has ever known.

I guess I just saw her as much younger than she really was? Or him as much older? Not sure - but I loved the sort of full circle of that and its similarities to Fables parents.But again, the end\u2026 holy crap didn\u2019t see that coming!

                "reviewText": "I have to be honest when I say I picked up this book really not knowing much about it and having never read any of Adrienne Young\u2019s books before. But I kept seeing it everywhere on Instagram and the cover was too beautiful for me not to own it. I went in knowing very little. I knew it was YA and it was about pirates. That\u2019s all. I haven\u2019t read a YA novel in quite some time so it was a little hard to get back into that mindset. I\u2019ve been reading a lot of historical fiction, so very different. It took me at least 25-40% of the way through the book to really get into it.There was not enough scenery description for me to actually envision Jeval and Dern and the places she went. Even the ship. There was also very minimal character description beyond hair color, scruff, and occasionally skin color. I\u2019m a reader that likes a lot of detail to be immersed.The story itself was a good one. When it was to the point where it looked like Fable was actually going to find her dad I was into it and ready to see that play out. I was not so much into the romance part of the story. I think if there had been a little more depth to the characters then I would have been more excited to read it. I did enjoy it, though, especially toward the end, and I will be picking up Namesake to continue the story when it comes out.For those of you that don\u2019t know what Fable is about the story follows a teenager named Fable. At fourteen she was abandoned by her pirate father on a dangerous island the day after her mother went down with his ship (great guy, eh? Why she would even want to find him is beyond me). For two years a ship crewed by equally aged teenagers came into port and bought gems from her, which she dives to the bottom of the ocean to recover. This crew has helped to keep her alive. Otherwise she would have starved to death there on Jeval, the pirate island. She has saved her coin and finally at eighteen she has enough to pay for passage to find her father. The ship that takes her is the same teenage crewed ship that\u2019s been buying from her. Not to give too much away but they have some adventures as they stop on an island called Dern and then make their way to Ceros where her father is doing business with his ship empire. She has come for her inheritance, a spot on his crew. The entire time I was reading I was like \u201cWHY? WHY WOULD SHE WANT TO CREW FOR HIM?\u201d I think if I were in her position and he did to me what he did to her, I\u2019d rather starve to death than work for that man, but that\u2019s just me. Because of this I found it hard to relate to Fable.The book was worth a read, and I do think if you are more in the YA novel/teenager mindset it would be a fast-paced, action-packed pirate read for something different!",

                "reviewText": "I received an eARC of this book via Netgalley. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of this review.I adored this book! Fable by Adrienne Young is the first in a duology about a young woman who is just trying to survive and find her own way in the world. This was my first time reading Adrienne Young, and I could talk for days about her writing. I love it! I will definitely be reading everything of hers I can get my hands on from now on. But I digress, let\u2019s talk about Fable.Fable is 17 at the opening of the book and barely surviving as a dredger on the fictional island of Jeval. The daughter of a notorious trader, Fable keeps her identity a secret to protect herself and the father who dumped her on the island four years earlier. He told her if she could find her way off the island that it would prove to him she could survive life as a trader and he\u2019d give her \u201cwhat was hers.\u201d So Fable works daily to survive with the goal of getting off the island. With the help of a young trader, Fable gets off the island and sets a course to find her father.West is the captain of the Marigold, a small trading ship with an even smaller crew. Fable doesn\u2019t really know him. She only knows that if it wasn\u2019t for him, she\u2019d have died a long time ago. Trading with him is the only thing that kept her going the last four years. Now she is on his ship. I like West. He\u2019s loyal to his crew, but beyond that we don\u2019t really know. It\u2019s clear that he has feelings for Fable from the start (why else would he let her on his ship?) and he\u2019s hiding something. Beyond that, West is a mystery to me. I like him, I want to love him, but we will see.The rest of the crew on the Marigold I love, Willa especially. Each of the crew members bring something different to the story, and each bond with Fable in their own way. I found myself rooting for them to all get along and for Fable to just stay with them, but her goal is not the same as theirs. She is determined to find Saint, her father, the notorious tradesman who rules the Narrows.Let\u2019s take a sec to just talk about the world-building here. This world seems to be based off the Carribean and time period that revolves around pirates and traders. The best way to describe the traders here are as pirates, at least that\u2019s my opinion. I really pictured them as cutthroat and ruthless. The markets they trade in remind me a little of the markets described in port towns during the colonial days of America. The vivid imagery used to describe both the ports and the diving that Fable does as a dredger put me right in the action. I could feel cool breeze coming off the water and smell the salt in the air.Overall, I really enjoyed this one. I decided to give it 4.5 stars (rounded to 5). The only reason I knocked it down a half star is predictability. I had most of the story figured out well before the end. However, that did not lessen my enjoyment. I adored this story and cannot wait for more set in this world. If you enjoy fantasy, slow burn (and I do mean SLOW) romance, and adventure on the high seas, you are in for a treat.",

I did find the building into the romance was non-existent. One minute you've only seen brief displays of the possibility of something, and the next there is a love that burns as bright as the sun. It left me feeling awkward about it, not to mention there was no anticipation built that the admission of feelings satiated.I would recommend this book to the younger YA community.",

                "reviewText": "I flew through this book in less than a day.I love the Pirates of the Caribbean movies - yes, even the last one - so a book about ships and diving for gems and treasure is right up my alley.I didn't realize how much I loved a ship setting, especially since I've read other books on ships and pirate books (which I also loved) so I'm glad I figured this out, cuz wow, love.The pace was great, I didn't feel like it dragged anywhere, and I like the characters and the world/island setting.I wish the dredging of the Lark was a little more detailed but other than that, *chefs kiss*I hope that Saint and Fable have a relationship, but I have a feeling he's gonna die \ud83d\ude2cI ship West and Fable - See what I did there??*crickets*Fest? Wable? Oh, no, Wable is bad \ud83d\ude02",

The tension and drama throughout this book had me on the edge of my seat I cannot wait to get started on book 2 as the cliff hanger from book 1 left me shocked",

                "reviewText": "Adrienne Young's writing style and her way of storytelling is fluid and is driven by fascinating characters.It is amazing how much knowledge about ships and their construction is incorporated here. The author seems to know exactly what she\u2019s talking about.In FABLE,Adrienne Young tells us a story about the various stages of survival, of being abandoned, neglected, and the importance of being at home. The love of a daughter for her father, father for daughter, between siblings, and about a boy and girl. Fable's world is so dark and brutal just like the deep sea on a stormy night.Fable, by Adrienne Young, is a quick and fun read! I can\u2019t wait to read the second part NAMESAKE next.I absolutely loved it!Highly recommend!!!",
