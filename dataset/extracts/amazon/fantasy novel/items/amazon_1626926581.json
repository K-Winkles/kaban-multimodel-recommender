                "reviewText": "Most Isekai fall into this trope of some shut in gamer who's only life is the MMO RPG they obsesse over, then they miraculously find themselves in the body of their over powered character. And typically the knowledge of the game they have actually applies to the real world. So all the hours they spent gaming actually means something now. Then typically they spend their time either making a harem and/or trying to recreate, things they liked about, Japan in this new world. That is 98% of all Isekai. This book however has none of that. A group of people find themselves in this strange new fantasy world and don't remember anything about where they came from or themselves. The only thing they know is their name.This story had excellent character development. It's a fantasy story about how a group of outcast strangers must band together to be able to survive in this new world that they have found themselves in. Yes there is magic and yes there's game like mechanics mentioned, but it honestly feels more like a fantasy story than your typical Isekai.I watched the anime based off this series first before reading the book. I loved the anime and wanted to know more of the story. I was not disappointed in this book as it follows closely along with the anime. By the end of the book it's still not covered everything in season 1.Great book, I can't wait to start the next one. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is an Isekai fan but wants to read something different.",

If you\u2019re like me you\u2019re here because you want more of the story\u2026 That being said the pacing in the novel is vastly different from the pacing in the anime. Major plot points happen while the world is being built. It makes it hard to get invested in the characters other than Manato and Hauhiro. This book is far from bad or even the worse light novel I\u2019ve read. It\u2019s just not the best either. Still a good read and I recommend it in case you want to know more!",

Not only that but out of all of the isekai books I read this one feels the most real. There is one complaint I have of how so many characters stumble over their words/ aren't very confident. That complaint brings more realism into the book as you get used to it and made me feel more invested as I saw the characters grow. A truly amazing book.",

                "reviewText": "I have now read multitudes of isekai light novels and watched their animes. I've tried out things from the vastly popular, to the niche and obscure, to the amateur. I often mention that I do not believe there is such thing as an original story or idea. There is but one story, and we just live it and tell it from different perspectives, and that is where creativity dwells. Grimgar goes well beyond refreshing and satisfying for me, it is outright fulfilling and highly praiseworthy. Thank you for writing this, I can't wait to read more. It is wonderful to have a story that actually communicates a very human experience. It is thrilling to have a story about the fantastical that explores things other than cheap thrills found in adolescent fantasies.",

Instead, they have a hazy feeling about events leading up to the day they woke up in complete darkness in the bottom of a tower located in a strange land. They know it to be strange place, yet they struggle to remember more than their names.Now they are told they have to fight. There is not much of an alternate in the way of options. This new world is kill or be killed. Follow the underdogs on thier journey through this world called Grimgar.Having watched the anime, I am excited to see how this story will flesh out and compare to the main plot points covered in the show. Overall it was an enjoyable read with a few touching scenes. Volume 1 ends on a great note and I'm more than ready to jump right into volume 2.",

Adem\u00e1s, es lo que de verdad pasar\u00eda si a nosotros, los lectores, nos mandaran en formato Isekai.Tiene un estilo de escritura que a m\u00ed se me hace ligero, y no es vocabulario especialmente complicado. Eso s\u00ed, no es un libro de ni\u00f1os... trata temas algo m\u00e1s serios y crudos, aunque lo haga con humor y fantas\u00eda a veces.Esta primera novela cubre la primera mitad de la temporada, y adem\u00e1s incluye m\u00e1s datos y nuevas perspectivas que en el anime se saltan... como por ejemplo, que empiezan todos en unas circunstancias a\u00fan m\u00e1s pat\u00e9ticas que como nos muestra en la animaci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, Ranta es tan frustrante o incluso m\u00e1s que en el anime... est\u00e1 incre\u00edblemente bien adaptado todo.Como contra (aunque a mi no me afecta), es que s\u00f3lo est\u00e1 disponible en ingl\u00e9s.",
