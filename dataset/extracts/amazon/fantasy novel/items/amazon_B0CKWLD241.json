It is mostly a good read with relatable (flawed) characters some of which are even likeable. The worldbuilding is decent, if a bit simplistic.The characters develop, but it does feel a bit jarring at times. For example, at the end of book 1 Rudy agrees he needed to get away from Sylphy because he did not want a obedient submissive friend which he seems to have promptly forgotten in the first chapter of this book when angrily thinking he was training Sylphy to be his obedient woman. Rudy himself is well aware that he has issues when it comes to women and his treatment of them, although I feel the women are a bit too forgiving.The story also comes with a bit of over the top behavior that feels out of place that is commom in light novels.Still, an enjoyable read. Up to the next part were the real story begins...",
