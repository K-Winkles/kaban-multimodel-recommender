Two stubborn, naive, and powerful individuals overcome their own biases, the world's expectations, and fall in love with each other at the same time?Sounds like my kind of romance! (Sorry but I'm a Jane Austin girl at heart!) I don't even really like most modern romances and I am giving this a 10/10. But if you like to complain about \"not being true to the source material,\" then I suggest you skip it and save everyone the trouble.",

Psyche, as I imagine, is supposed to be this badass fighter and survivor\u2026 I felt the story lacked portraying that, or at least lacked detail in that category. I understand it is firstly a romance novel, but it didn\u2019t have the great and intense detail of fights and creatures slain that it could have had. Her first monster fight victory was described in less than a page. I know she wasn\u2019t going to have a \u201cHercules hero montage\u201d but her greatness in fighting monsters that she was supposed to have (at least in the beginning) was relatively boring and underwhelming.",

It is honestly one of my favourite myths.I thought that this was a great retelling and couldn't put this book down.A great feminist take on this classic myth. Blended with the stories of a few other heroes and gods. I loved the romance, the adventure and the stakes shown in this story. A must read Greek myth retelling \ud83c\udffa\ud83c\udfdb",
