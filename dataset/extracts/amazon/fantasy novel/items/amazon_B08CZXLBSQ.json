        "description": "Captivating and action-packed, From Blood and Ash is a sexy, addictive, and unexpected fantasy perfect for fans of Sarah J. Maas and Laura Thalassa.A Maiden...Chosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy\u2019s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers.A Duty...The entire kingdom\u2019s future rests on Poppy\u2019s shoulders, something she\u2019s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden.A Kingdom...Forsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel. Read more",

                "reviewText": "I only picked up From Blood and Ash by Jennifer Armentrout because I was completing a reading challenge. The challenge was to read a book on the Goodreads Choice list, and frankly, From Blood and Ash was the one selection I thought I might tolerate! I like fantasy romance but find most seem written for the YA audience, a group I left behind many decades ago!I admit I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much I enjoyed this novel. Let's start with the incredibly designed cover art. The brilliant red roses on the black background immediately drew my attention away from the rather pedestrian covers of the other book selections. The large three-dimensional font was hard to ignore. The map drawn on the first page gave the world an old-time, Tolkien feel to the story. Though it is hard to see in the Kindle version, it was helpful to refer to as the story progressed. Some reviews mentioned that a glossary and character list would have been a welcome addition. I would agree I would have liked it in the beginning, but as I continued to read, I was so connected to the kingdom, the characters and the plot, I no longer needed the reference tool. I was as familiar with the people and places as I was with my own backyard!From the very first page to the last Jennifer Armentrout had complete control of my emotions. Her wonderous word choices had me in tears at times, laughing at other times; on an emotional roller coaster experiencing all the highs and lows as her characters did! Jennifer magically transported me into her beautifully created world. I went from being a reader to being a participant, totally immersed in her story.The main characters, Poppy and Hawke, were intriguing. Poppy's transformation from a powerless tool of the ruling class to a determined warrior woman gave me chills. The tension and suspense as she took back her right to self-determination had me clenching my fists, as I prayed for her success. Hawke, with all his sexy devil-may-care personality, kept me guessing the entire book. Was he good or too good to be true? I confess I am still not sure! But the pairing of these two strong characters amped up the energy levels, to the point I was surprised that the electricity between them did not set the pages on fire.What started as a challenge to read something new became a wild, twisted ride through the author's creative imagination! An epic read, well worth the hours I spent reading it!",

The detail to the characters, scenery, events and story plots is simply exceptional. The storylines unfold with so much intrigue, to keep you the reader completely captivated!!! And the characters, oh they are just so everything, each one multidimensional. I have found myself laughing out loud. Slapping my hand over my mouth in shock and sighing in awe. I've been an avid reader for 40 years and this is some of the best story telling I've read. I hope someone picks this up as a screen play it would be epic!! Well done Jennifer!",

                "reviewText": "\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f.75/5\ud83c\udf36\ud83c\udf36.75/5I admit, I was hesitant to read this book. It seems like people either love it or hate it, and I was worried I'd end up in the latter camp. I love fantasy romance, but one thing I've noticed is that a lot of the popular books and series have rather lackluster writing, and that was my biggest concern going in.From Blood and Ash is the first in a fantasy romance series and follows our narrator, 18 year old Penellaphe (Poppy) Balfour. She is a Maiden, and is destined to 'Ascend' as a gift to the gods, and ultimately, save the Kingdom of Solis. Poppy also has a gift, she can sense a person's physical and mental pain, and by touching them, relieve them of some of it. The Ascended are essentially the ruling class over the kingdom, however they are very mysterious. Poppy lives a life where she is expected to be sheltered; speak only to a few, remain completely covered, never leave the castle, never be touched, etc. However, she is not so good at playing this role. She knows how to fight in hand-to-hand combat, and carries a dagger (we love a stabby woman) and often sneaks out. At the beginning of the book, she leaves the castle one night and ventures to The Red Pearl, a notoriously debaucherous tavern. There, she meets a royal guard who ends up kissing her, and thus begins Poppy's internal investigation on whether or not she truly wants to become the Maiden.There is strife in the Kingdom, because another group, The Atlantians, led by \"The Dark One\" are said to have plagued the earth with dangerous creatures called Craven. A group called The Descenters are supporters of The Atlantians and want to see the downfall of the Kindom. Each group believes the other is responsible for all their issues. The Descenters/The Atlantians would also like to see the Maiden killed.After one of her personal guards is killed by a masked man, Poppy is assigned a new guard, Hawke (they guy from the Red Pearl). Poppy is practically instantly in love with him and decides to essentially throw all of her Maidenly duties out of the window for him. She is forced to decide if she should fall to temptation and live her life for herself and risk being found unworthy of the gods, or give up all of her freedoms. Fast forward, after a deadly attack on the castle by the Descenters, Poppy is called by the queen to arrive to the Capital sooner than anticipated, and likely to speed up her Ascension. During the treacherous journey from the castle to the Capital, it is revealed that not everything (or everyone) is truly as it seems.Alright, on to my review. I was pleasantly surprised that the writing was better than I was expecting. Was it fantastic? No, but it wasn't bad enough to the point where it drew me out of the story over and over. There were a few grammatical and syntactical errors that were a bit confusing, so the editing could have been a bit better, yes. I also wish that there had been a map (every fantasy needs a map; they look cool and are super helpful) and perhaps a glossary because there are A LOT of different people, events, groups, etc. etc. and that was difficult to keep straight in my head. I wish there was a little more world-building to make things a little clearer. The political intrigue was interesting.Overall, the characters were pretty good. Poppy is interesting, although she is not nearly as sheltered as JLA tries to make her out to be. She's an excellent fighter, she's witty, and swears. She is definitely naive, but I think that's because she's 18. Hawke was of course hot, but his idea of consent was definitely in the grey area.The \ud83c\udf36 were not over the top and were written well. There was a loooot of tension between Poppy and Hawke which I loved.My one petty gripe was the names she used for people and places. Penellaphe instead of Poppy. The Atlantians. A black character named Tawny. Things like that.Overall, I did enjoy this book. It's not perfect, but most books aren't. It definitely has some faults. I am definitely planning on reading the rest of the books in the series and the FBAA world, and I'm looking forward to them, feeling hopeful.",

                "reviewText": "Depois de ler as fantasias escritas por Sarah J Maas, \u00e9 muito dif\u00edcil gostar muito de outros livros do g\u00eanero, tendo em vista que ningu\u00e9m sabe construir um mundo t\u00e3o complexo e com criaturas e personagens t\u00e3o distintos como ela ou trazer aquelas reviravoltas inimagin\u00e1veis pelo leitor.Entretanto, a autora desse livro surpreende ao chegar perto do n\u00edvel de Sarah, pois consegue criar um enredo muito envolvente a cada cap\u00edtulo, interessante, diferente de tantos outros e com elementos bem inesperados.Em um mundo dominado pelos Ascendidos, seres escolhidos pelos deuses para serem aben\u00e7oados a viver por muitos anos com habilidades sobre-humanas, conhecemos Poppy, a donzela do reino, tamb\u00e9m aben\u00e7oada pelos mesmos seres para ascender e permitir a ascens\u00e3o de tantos outros nobres.O grande problema \u00e9 que esse papel que parece ser t\u00e3o honroso vem acompanhado de uma intensa repress\u00e3o, j\u00e1 que ela n\u00e3o pode mostrar seu rosto ou conversar com ningu\u00e9m al\u00e9m de seus guardas e dama de companhia, ir a qualquer lugar que queira ou usar seu dom para ajudar outros, atividades t\u00e3o normais a outras garotas.Quando ela conhece Hawke, seu novo guarda, tudo muda, porque ela come\u00e7a a querer ser muito mais do que \u00e9 e realmente ser capaz de escolher como viver, o que leva a escolhas inesperadas e descobertas impactantes sobre a verdade do mundo que nunca questionou.\u00c9 um enredo muito bem constru\u00eddo, que instiga a cada momento e acaba se tornando algo muito diferente e maior do que aparenta ser em boa parte da hist\u00f3ria, sendo capaz de intrigar e surpreender bastante o leitor. Muito bom!Obs. c/ spoilers dos pr\u00f3ximos livros: Como j\u00e1 li os quatro livros dispon\u00edveis da s\u00e9rie e tive uma grande decep\u00e7\u00e3o, adianto para quem interessar possa que a autora destr\u00f3i no quarto livro totalmente o relacionamento de almas g\u00eameas dos personagens principais constru\u00edda nos tr\u00eas primeiros livros para transform\u00e1-la em uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o a tr\u00eas deturpada e totalmente incoerente com tudo que havia sido escrito e desenvolvido anteriormente.Ela vendeu uma mentira nos tr\u00eas primeiros livros da hist\u00f3ria, porque o tipo de relacionamento que ela construiu jamais poderia incluir uma terceira pessoa em qualquer n\u00edvel.Infelizmente, ela conseguiu estragar uma das principais premissas da s\u00e9rie, desperdi\u00e7ando uma hist\u00f3ria com um enorme potencial.N\u00e3o vale mesmo a pena gastar tempo e dinheiro lendo os outros livros para ver esse rumo infeliz que ela d\u00e1 ao enredo e aos personagens. Uma grande pena!",

One of the main characters reminds me a lot of Damon from Vampire Diaries, you'll know once you read it.Great book, finished it in under a week after not reading a single book in 10-15 years. Ordered the 2nd book in the series already.",
