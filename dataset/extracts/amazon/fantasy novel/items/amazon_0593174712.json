            "Editorial Reviews From School Library Journal Gr 1\u20133\u2014This inventive graphic novel adaptation of the beloved chapter book series retells the story of siblings Jack and Annie discovering an enchanted tree house in the woods of Frog Creek, PA. Transported back in time, the pair encounter majestic dinosaurs in their original habitat. Jack and Annie are in for an unexpected visitor as a Tyrannosaurus rex approaches the nest of baby Anatosauruses they uncover. Not only will they have to evade history's most notorious dinosaur, but they will also have to figure out how to safely return home before bedtime. The story seamlessly translates into comics format, heightening the suspense for young readers. The pacing is effective, with more images and less text than in the original, which works well for emergent readers. The artwork has a distinctly digital quality, giving the tale an animated feel that children will appreciate. Jack and Annie are both white. VERDICT This fresh take on \"The Magic Tree House\" brings the adventures to life for those who enjoyed the classic series and newcomers alike.\u2014Claire Moore, Manhattan Beach Lib., CA About the Author MARY POPE OSBORNE is the author of the New York Times #1 bestselling Magic Tree House series as well as coauthor of the Magic Tree House Fact Tracker series, along with her husband, Will, and her sister, Natalie Pope Boyce.

Sadly all the books at his reading level were \u201cto babyish\u201d, so we started reading graphic novels together.He has read the first 3 chapters with hardly any help and it has been AMAZING to see his confidence grow and him actually be interested in a book!!I highly recommend this book! I already pre ordered the next one!",
