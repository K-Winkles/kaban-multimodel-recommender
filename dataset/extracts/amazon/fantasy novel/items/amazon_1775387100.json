            "Editorial Reviews Review Renwick has designed an imaginative world for her story with rich details without letting description getting in the way of action. Book One of this series is a quick, delightful read that leaves you wondering what those kids will get up to next! - Goodreads reviewI thoroughly enjoyed this book. There was darkness, adventure, friendship, fantasy... it pulled me in from the first paragraph to the last. I can't wait for the rest of the series!! -Goodreads reviewThe story has wonderful characters in a charming setting that kept me wanting to read more. I myself can't wait for the next book in this series! - Goodreads review A must for children and adults who love Harry Potter and Hocus Pocus. I definitely will read Book Two and will buy a copy of BoC in paperback. Jessica Renwick has a magical talent for twisting words into an exciting adventure. -Goodreads review About the Author An avid reader and writer since she was a child, Jessica Renwick inspires with tales of adventures about friendship, courage and being true to yourself. She is the author of The Book of Chaos, coming this fall, the first in a fantasy series for middle-grade children.

                "reviewText": "Depending on how adventurous your young person is, this is a great adventure book for young people with parental guidance. It does deal with sucking the life out of people -- murdering them slowly - using others for your own gain, and various types of magic. If you are a Christian and you have children who are not solid in their Faith, you will want to wait a little bit to read this with them. You will want to be clear that this is an alternate world from ours so witchcraft in our world is not good since witches are pulling power from sources that are not Godly. However, this book has definitions that explain that Fable is a sorceress...meaning her magic comes from within. There is a clear good and evil side in the book. The witch in the book pulls power from nature. The wizard pulls power from unknown sources while learning to cast spells. The Lich is a witch gone bad. I read this as an adult. It has similar issues that Harry Potter had for parents of young Christians. While children can read stories with magic in it, as a Christian parent, you should always read it with them, ready to give an answer and explanation when needed. I think Jessica did a good job creating a unique world for her story. There were some unanswered questions by the end of this book, but since there are additional quest books, I assume the questions will be answered later. I highly recommend the book for readers who are able to enjoy the fantasy of the magical land without wanting to become a witch or wizard themselves. There is no sex in the book. However, there is a male gay couple. The gay couple is approached as matter-of-fact, but not glorified. As a Christian, I would have talked about this relationship with my children and explained that while we do not endorse a gay lifestyle and see it as simply another sin that people should not enter into, people have a right to choose their own path. If you are opposed to your children reading about openly gay relationships, you need to be aware that it is in there.",

The magic goes wrong, and Fable\u2019s little cousin is kidnapped instead, but finding herself in a magic land with a talking chicken, Fable is determined to save Timothy, no matter who gets in her way.I\u2019m delighted to say that this book lives up to its magical cover and title. It had only a few copy editing errors, and while the plot was just a bit canned, it was still an engaging read with a lot of great ideas. The world building was creative, and the writing vivid and exciting. If I ever see the sequel available, I\u2019ll be sure to pick it up.",

                "reviewText": "This book is fabulous. I do have some feedback.Cons:1. Too fast-paced:Sometimes, quick reads are a good thing but not in this case. Before her final confronting with the antagonist, I feel they should have had more adventures and action to tell us about the characters in greater depht. We know very little about the personality of Fable and company, as the book felt rushed to the end.2. Don't stop it there!:The ending of the book felt incomplete. The overall storyline would have been much better if the author had added more on top of the ending. I'm not saying that I dislike the way the book ended because of a cliffhanger, I'm saying it wasn't satisfying to close the book as you finish it.Pros:1. The writing quality is so good!The writing was gorgeous and polished, the author's charm seeping into every page. The 'what happens next' feeling keep the pages turning, as you are submerged into a land of mystery and wonder.This is my honest opinion. I mean no disrespect to the talented, amazing being who wrote this, as me of all people know it is much easier writing a review than the actual novel.",
