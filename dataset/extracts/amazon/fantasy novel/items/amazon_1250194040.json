                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars #ughJay",
                "reviewText": "One of my pleasant memories of the pandemic was participating in the \u201cSooz Your Own Adventure\u201d aka the book whose plot was determined by a daily Twitter poll. So when I heard the author would be releasing a novel version of it, I had some hesitation. After all, Twitter hive mind led to some occasional, uh, interesting choices, as well as lots of #ughJay hilarity. But this book is mostly completely rewritten, not to mention it\u2019s only part of the story.After her dad was revealed as a traitor to the Luminaries, Winnie and her family were banished from the order. The Luminaries are responsible for dealing with the creatures, called nightmares, that appear in the forest every night. Considering that nearly everyone in Hemlock Falls was involved in the secretive group, that made for a lonely past four years. Her only hope is to take the first of the Hunter Trials on her sixteenth birthday and convince them to take her back. But the forest is nothing like she remembers it and neither are the Luminaries. When Winnie sees evidence of strange things happening in the forest, no one believes her, except for Jay, the town bad boy and her former best friend. With a new nightmare lurking in the forest and little help, can Winnie survive the Trials?Some of the world building as definite promise. The hunters are divided into families, each taking the name (and corresponding hunting night) of a day of the week. Each family specializes in certain things, whether that\u2019s training the next generation of hunters, developing new gear, or managing the bureaucracy. While the Luminaries are focused on containing the spirit in the forest by ridding it of nightmares every night, another group, the Dianas, seek to use its power for their own ends. The Dianas were the weakest part of the world-building for me, as it\u2019s never quite explained why they\u2019re so evil. The \u201cnever quite explained\u201d bit is unfortunately true of the rest of the world-building, though. How do they manage to keep their towns so secret? How do they manage family trees when literally everyone has one of seven last names? Why is the position of Lead Hunter so important?\u201cShe belongs in the forest. She belongs as a Luminary. She belongs as a hunter.\u201dPart of that could be explained by Winnie\u2019s character. At times, Winnie read a lot younger to me than sixteen. Of course, she\u2019s suffered without any friends for the past four years, watching her family fall further into poverty while her mother works herself to exhaustion. But the Wednesday line prides itself on loyalty and Winnie never seems to question her family\u2019s banishment, instead rebuking herself for not realizing her dad was a Diana. She trains by herself in secret and refuses to accept any future for herself that doesn\u2019t involve her being a hunter. Of course she accepts the Luminaries\u2019 worldview without any questions as she\u2019s never known anything else!\u201cSo what if last night didn\u2019t go according to plan? So what if everyone was right and she hadn\u2019t been ready for the forest? She still got what she wanted and what her family needed. There\u2019s no reason not to keep going.\u201dIt\u2019s only when she passes the first trial that her thinking starts to change. After four years of shunning, the rest of the Luminaries suddenly act like the intervening four years never happened. She\u2019s welcomed back into hunter training, the kids who were bullying her a few days ago now act like her best friends and her mom and brother get job promotions. It\u2019s exactly what she wanted to happen, but the whiplash is too much for Winnie. Why does she have to risk her life \u2013 because Winnie does nearly die, several times \u2013 before they decide her dad\u2019s actions don\u2019t matter anymore? How could her supposed best friends have turned their backs on her four years ago? Why is she so unhappy even though she everything she thought she wanted?\u201cIt is disconcerting that he can be so extremely well-proportioned while also being, ugh, Jay.\u201dAfter she\u2019s welcomed back, Winnie also starts connecting (or reconnecting) with some of the Luminaries. Some of the other prospective hunters reach out to her, but there\u2019s still a distinct chilliness between her and one of her former best friends, Erica, that leaves Winnie hurt and confused. But the biggest chunk of time is spent with her other former best friend, Jay \u2013 who\u2019s also her former crush. There\u2019s the barest start of a romantic relationship, along with a lot of anger and confusion, because he falls somewhere on the enemy to friend spectrum but she still trusts him, even though it\u2019s obvious Jay\u2019s keeping secrets of his own.The plot was fine as well. What it says in the blurb? That\u2019s exactly what you get, Winnie trying to make it through the three hunter trials. It felt like there was a lot of choreographing of future plot points. I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s because I knew the original plot (so I have a general idea of where this version might be headed) or if it really was that predictable. Some things were so blatantly obvious that I was banging my head against the wall going \u201cugh, Winnie\u201d. All that \u2013 and the fact that it\u2019s told in third-person present tense \u2013 could be forgiven because I honestly enjoyed the majority of the story, except for this last point. The ending was ridiculously abrupt, like I kept trying to turn the page on my ereader in confusion. In a way, it makes logical sense where the book ends, but the structure of the book and the pacing left me hanging. Most (almost all) of the subplots are unresolved, including one introduced near the end of the book. It felt unfinished in a way that really rubbed me wrong.\u201cYou either trust the forest or you don\u2019t, Winnie.\u201dOverall, 3.5 nostalgic stars. Without that nostalgia, this would be more solidly a three thanks to that ending. Either way, I know I\u2019ll read the next book just because I want some resolution to, uh, any of the plot points.",

I was around for the whole crowd source story when Dennard started this on Twitter. It really was a great way to get the community together and see how our choices would shape the story. So when Dennard said she was going to try and take the breadcrumbs of that project and recreate something new, I was sold. Dennard did not disappoint. I really liked the atmosphere and the vibe of the story. Dennard's writing has gotten so strong over the years. My one and only little gripe with this book was that the characters could act a little too childish at times. I know the age group is like teens in high school and I am now older, so maybe I just find it annoying, but that is why I am not going to punish the rating. The Luminaries is a strong start and foundation for this series and I look forward to seeing how this wraps up in the final book.",

The premise of hunters going into a forest every night to eliminate monsters plaguing the forest sounds so amazing as well as the trials the potential hunters have to go through. However, the story itself felt a little flat up until the final moments. I enjoyed the trials themselves and thought they were hr most interesting element of the book. Although, I felt like the plot needed to be teased out more between the big baddie in the forest and the big reveal in the final pages. I\u2019m hoping it was intentionally vague to help set up the next book in the series. I did enjoy it enough to read the next one in the series and see where Dennard goes with the characters.",

I loved the characters so much I especially loved Winnie she was such a great character that just wanted the best for her family and to end the shunning they have done to her and her family for four years. I also loved Winnie's family her brother Darian his boyfriend Andrew and her mother I like that they didn't automatically embrace them being accepted back for them it was four years too late for them to accept it all at face value. I also liked Jay the potential love interest he was a interesting character looking forward to where that goes. I loved the plot it starts with Winnie telling how they were basically shunned for something her father did so she sets out to end that by entering the trails to become a hunter and end that shunning many things happen along the way looking forward to reading more.",

It was delightfully spooky and interesting and wowza! I still have soooo many questions so I sure hope we're getting sequel and SOON.This was an action packed adventure that was over waaaay too soon. I need MORE MORE MORE. GIMME GIMME GIMME.Sooz always sucks me into her stories and she's done it once again. Her writing is just unlike anyone else's. Any another author would have me annoyed at the fact we know so little still about The Whisperer and The Wolf, but Sooz just makes me crave that next book.I would looove to see Jay and Winnie's friendship / relationship grow. I already love their connection and wish we'd seen just a tad more of it.I'm giving The Luminaries 4,5 stars because there's a few things that irk me too much to give it the full 5 stars but DAMN, this book was so cool. I could really feel how much love went into writing this book.So book two... Can we strike a deal, Sooz? GIMME GIMME GIMMEThis book was provided to me by the author and Netgalley.",

It was so great that for days after I finished, I kept going to pick it back up before remembering that I'd already got to the end. I am SO looking forward to book two.Winnie Wednesday's life dream is to join the Luminaries and spend her nights destroying nightmarish monsters. But Winnie and her family have been shunned as traitors ever since her father betrayed Hemlock Falls, which means no training, no support, and no easy access to the hunter trials. If she's going to pass the trials and become a Luminary, she'll have to contend with more than monsters - an even bigger challenge than she expects given the new monster stalking the forest that only she has seen. Can she fulfil her dream, redeem her family and convince everyone that she's not making up the most deadly monster Hemlock Falls has ever seen, all while fighting for her life?I've been a long-time subscriber to Dennard's newsletter for her brilliant writing advice, but this is actually the first novel of hers that I've read (a few of the others have been waiting very patiently in the tbr pile on my kindle...) I'm absolutely going to have to rectify that this year because I loved The Luminaries so much! It was packed full of brilliant world building, non-stop action, tension and really high stakes. It also had brilliant characters who were flawed and made mistakes, with plenty of secrets still left to uncover in the next book.My Netgalley file was corrupted and kept skipping pages but I was so invested in what I had read that I went and bought the ebook so that I could keep reading.",

                "reviewText": "Dieses Buch war ganz genau das, was ich lesen wollte und ich habs geliebt. Ich will sofort zur\u00fcck zur ersten Seite bl\u00e4ttern und es nochmal lesen.2019 habe ich Susans Choose Your Own Adventure Twitter Thread entdeckt und begeistert wochenlang in den Polls gevotet und Winnie in ihrem Abenteuer voran gebracht (& auch umgebraucht, upsi). Jetzt eine weitere Version ihrer Geschichte zu lesen, die genau das verk\u00f6rpert, was ich an dem Twitter-Adventure schon geliebt habe und immer noch neue Dinge zu entdecken und neue Blickwinkel, war eine wahnsinnige Freude. Susan Dennard hat mir genau das geliefert was ich lesen wollte und noch eins drauf gesetzt.Ich liebe die spooky vibes, die Nightmares, die Hunter (wenn auch nicht alle) und ganz besonders alle Szenen im Wald. Winnies Geschichte ist irgendwie cozy und auch voller Nervenkitzel und perfekt f\u00fcr den Herbst (auch, wenn das Buch im Fr\u00fchling spielt).Ich finde, es ist noch Luft nach oben. Von Susans Witchlands-B\u00fcchern wei\u00df ich, wie fantastisch sie Plotten und Welten bauen kann und ich hoffe stark, dass das in Luminaries 2 & 3 noch folgen wird. Allerdings habe ich mir an keiner Stelle des Buches gedacht \"hier noch ein bisschen mehr, bitte\", einfach weil der Hauptaugenmerk auf Winnies emotionaler Entwicklung liegt und zus\u00e4tzlich Details in meinen Augen einfach zu \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigend gewesen w\u00e4ren. Es herrscht eine sch\u00f6ne Balance zwischen Action und heartfelt Moments und Stress und Aufatmen, allgemein fand ich das Tempo sehr angenehm. Und Winnie hatte einfach keinen brainspace f\u00fcr noch mehr Infos, die sie mit sich rumschleppen muss, girl was in survival mode the whole book.Ich bin sehr gespannt auf Band 2, freue mich sehr die angedeuteten Verstrickungen aufgedr\u00f6selt zu sehen und wie Winnie und #UghJay darauf reagieren werden und noch mehr zu der Welt zu lernen. Ein ziemlich guter erster Band, meiner Meinung nach.",

Sooz never disappoints me and once again she's absolutely hit the spot with this story!It's creepy, a little angsty, with quite a lot more to dig into in the next books, about the forest, the nightmares, monsters or not, and all the secrets unknown between Luminaries and Dianas!Devoured this in a day, enjoyed every page of it and I cannot wait to get book 2, as soon as possible!!",
