To make matters worse, Liam's own citizen start mass protests and fellow pupils of the Flash want to duel him to the death. What follows is as expected a funny highly entertaining story, partially based on misunderstandings (mostly of Liam) and partially due to his conscious actions. A great addition to the series and looking forward to what comes next.",
