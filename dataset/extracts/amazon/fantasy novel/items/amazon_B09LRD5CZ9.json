A chosen one. And the inevitable quest to slay a villain, save the kingdom, and fulfill a grand destiny.But this is not that kind of story.It does begin with a prophecy: A child will rise to defeat the Eternal Khan, a cruel immortal god-king, and save the kingdom.And that prophecy did anoint a hero, Jian, raised since birth in luxury and splendor, and celebrated before he has won a single battle.But that\u2019s when the story hits its first twist: The prophecy is wrong.What follows is a story more wondrous than any prophecy could foresee, and with many unexpected heroes: Taishi, an older woman who is the greatest grandmaster of magical martial arts in the kingdom but who thought her adventuring days were all behind her; Sali, a straitlaced warrior who learns the rules may no longer apply when the leader to whom she pledged her life is gone; and Qisami, a chaotic assassin who takes a little too much pleasure in the kill.And Jian himself, who has to find a way to become what he no longer believes he can be\u2014a hero after all.

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed this book a lot. It felt like I was reading a wuxia movie like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers. The intriguing plot had several twists and an ensemble cast of compelling (if not always likeable) characters. I like that one protagonist is an older lady; you don't see too many adults on epic adventures in fantasy. Even the one-and-done characters made an impression.I liked how the prose was descriptive without going overboard and removing me too far from the events at hand. The action scenes were a delight to read and they played out in my imagination like a good martial arts film. I got vibes of my favorite martial arts movies like Come Drink With Me, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and House of Flying Daggers.I love the creatively colorful way characters insult each other. It not only feels otherworldly, but feels \"smarter\" than simply using strings of curse words. Even the slur used against a certain group of people reminded me of the slur my parents told me they heard often when they lived in England during the 1970s. (My family is from India).One character named Sali had one of the most unique and original weapons I've ever seen in fantasy multimedia. Most fantasy novels I read give characters traditional weapons like swords, so Sali's cool weapon really just transported me to an otherworldly fantasy realm.Here are my Cons:This book is screaming out for a character guide and a lore glossary.Several characters have similar sounding names, so a character guide to help me keep track of who's who would have been wonderful.A lore glossary to deeper explain some of the worldbuilding would have been nice too, especially descriptions of the colorfully named martial arts techniques used by various characters.Oh, and the map in the book's preface needed to be better drawn. It was too dark, too small, and place names were difficult to read.I'm all in with this series and look forward to the next installment, since there are still some hanging plot threads that I need to know more about.",

If you're a fan of Wes Chu's other novels, you won't be disappointed with this one at all. I can't wait to get the next one and continue the story.",

                "reviewText": "The heroics are sure to come, but what strikes me about the first novel of this series is how Wesley Chu subverts the typical Chosen One arc, yet still nods to the classics as he passes them by. Clearly influenced by the wuxia genre, Chu isn\u2019t shy about name-dropping specific forms, but I was glad to find that almost all of his action is laid out in clean, cinematic fashion. There\u2019s quite a bit of it, too, so if you\u2019re an action junkie, you\u2019ll find plenty to enjoy. Chu deftly weaves together some distinct styles into a tapestry that progresses so fluidly that it really does feel like you might as well be at a movie theater.Very little of this action involves the supposed Hero, who is ejected from his destiny by mere circumstance. Instead, Chu treats us to a wide cast of masters from different schools and traditions that not only provide a spectrum of dynamic characters, but also their opposing viewpoints over the fallout of this botched prophecy. Often, I found my favorite moments among the rest of this cast, and, inevitably, I would become excited to see how they would fare against each other if they were to match up. Then, just like that, Chu follows through and gives the reader exactly what they could want.I won\u2019t spoil the fast-paced plotline, which unfolds unexpectedly, because that\u2019s exactly the point. I won\u2019t go over the characters you\u2019ll get to meet, how each one is unique but somehow familiar. And I won\u2019t mention the more\u2026 colorful sensory details that make up these fantastic locations.But I will say that for a genre so steeped in tradition, Wesley Chu found a way to make it feel new.",

                "reviewText": "Wesley Chu delivers quite the spectacular story with The Art of Prophecy. I was captivated the whole time, and often reminisced on favorite films like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and The Heroic Trio. Chu excels at capturing the feeling of adventure into the novel. You bounce around to eclectic cast of character of varying ages. Reminiscent of George R. R. Martin in its approach to perspective, but with the added bonus of creating chapter titles (a not so common art for adult fiction) that really keeps you guessing what will happen next. The story has a great rhythm and life to it. Although, I do think the \u201cmain character\u201d or \u201chero\u201d is kind of bland at the end. I hope he retains his spunk because I\u2019m afraid his growth might have humbled him to the degree that it removes the personality that I actually liked. Some readers may think of this as an improvement, but I enjoyed the arrogance of him. Readers are sure to fall in love with the politics of Chi\u2019s world full of gray characters and plenty of conflicting good intentions.",

There is much humour and camaraderie as well as excellent worldbuilding. Even the characters I didn't like, I cared about what was happening to them. The story kept me reading.I stopped reading about 90% of the way through, coming back to finish this months later, so my rating is closer to 3 and a half because the prose can go on a bit. But if dragged out scenes (it's not the description, just the thought processes of the characters) doesn't bother you, give this a read. You won't be disappointed.If you end up feeling like I did - intrigued but not emotionally invested - you might do as I'm going to do and avoid the sequel for a while. This gets a 4 star instead of 3 because of how much I enjoyed reading this BEFORE my siesta from it. Think of this as more of a 3 and a half.",
