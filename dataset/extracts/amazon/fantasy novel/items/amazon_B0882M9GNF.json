In the process we learn more about Rennt's background and the secret history of Hathara.Much like previous volumes, it shined in particular in regards to Lorraine, and while Rennt's past was not entirely unexpected it was still well told. I got the impression there was less meandering, but that might also be because the story was a lot more focussed. Still, if I have one complaint, it is that it was really short. You could combine it with V5 and still end up with a page count that while a tad high would still fit some light novels.So, a good albeit short read.",

                "reviewText": "I really liked the last few books. The regular village parts are interesting and the battle scenes are intense. They have the perfect cross between just Rentt living his life and battling. But this one is more of a flashback book. It's also the shortest book Okano wrote...so I'm kinda disapointed. It's sorta like an entire manga or book with nothing but flashbacks. I was hoping something more exciting to happen here. The blurb said, \"Fighting powerful monsters and unraveling many mysteries, Rentt climbs ranks even in death!\" Maybe not the exact wording but something like that. Except he didn't fight. I was hoping that he at least rose and took the test and rose to upper bronze but he didn't even do that. So the \"Rentt climbs the ranks even in death\" only meant the previous books not this one. And the only mystery he unraveled is only half unraveled. Apart from the divine spirit he got his divine powers from. Spoiler Alert! Loraine also got divine powers. What I'm thinking right now is that if it is so easy to get divine powers, a the wrong person got it they can use the divine powers for corrupt reasons. So I'm overall giving this book a 3.4 stars and the stars are only beacause it's better than some of the average book, It kept me till the end which I can't say for some, and that's sorta pushing it some too. The story is okay as a sort of filler.",

I prefer to read lite novels because unlike manga and anime adaptations you get a full arc. Honestly manga is the only visual art form that says less than the written word. Unfortunately the last two volumes are all build up and no pay off. At least here you do get a look at Rentt's past and why he is a chaste hero but I found the end infuriating.Spoilers:Rentt faps around his hometown. He pays respect to his parents and discovers who gave him his divinity powers. Doesn't have a single battle and the end is exactly the same as volume 5 except it's a big city instead. Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh! I don't know why Okano's doing this but I hope he stops before this becomes another Bleach and he loses all his fans. This volume much like the last volume is more bone than meat and he really could have added three more chapters so it would have had some kind of ending and not just the face slap this ended on.",
