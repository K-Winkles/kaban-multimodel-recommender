        "description": "With the advancement ceremony and fellowship gatherings complete, Rozemyne\u2019s new year at the Royal Academy can properly begin. She goes on another library-inspired rampage and pushes the other Ehrenfest second-years to finish their classes on the first day, all while hunting for new allies to recruit into her Library Committee.Somehow, Rozemyne manages to cause even more problems, and in quicker succession than the year before. She spends more time with the professors, the archduke candidates from top-ranking duchies, and even the Sovereignty\u2019s third prince, much to her guardians\u2019 displeasure. But as they agonize over interduchy diplomacy, Rozemyne blazes ahead on her own path. She charges forward with unbending focus and even hunts a ternisbefallen feybeast that shows up in Ehrenfest\u2019s gathering spot!This is the newest volume of this biblio-fantasy wherein the book-obsessed protagonist can\u2019t quite catch a break. Includes two original short stories and four-panel manga by You Shiina!",

I will be waiting on the side of that very steep cliff. (since it's a cliffhanger no cliffs involved in the story.) So much so I'm contemplating buying them in Japanese and learning how to read them. At least then I can hold them all in my hands while I lament my decision. I guess I'll have to read them all over from the beginning again while I wait. Two thumbs way up.Tiny spoilerPs.

Myne being worried sick when Ferdinand did not scold her at a point where she very much expected to be so was rather funny. The short stories at the end are great as well, in that they show how Myne is somewhat of an unreliable narrator. If I have one complaint, it is that there is clearly something going on behind the scenes, something that is not nearly as simple as a hostile neighbouring duchy, but things progress very slowly in that regards which at times leaves me wondering whether something is a plot hole, a red herring or something that the author is going to answer in the future. I don't mind slice-of-life, but at times I do wish a bit more progress in the plot.",
