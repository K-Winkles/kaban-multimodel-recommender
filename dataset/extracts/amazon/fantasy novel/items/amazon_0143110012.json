It's especially great if you like good vs evil stories, which I do, so I love it.Edit: Just finished it and I'd like to add that this book nearly got me fired. There are soooo many scenes where I literally couldn't stop reading which NEVER happens to me. It's jaw-dropping, grotesque (seriously the blood eagle?) in all the best ways, and maddeningly addictive. My boss yelled at me at one point to put it down. We're close though so I told her \"just one more paragraph.\"When's the next one come out?",

                "reviewText": "I am very conflicted about \u201cThe Last Days of Magic\u201d, a novel by Mark Tompkins. On the one hand, I enjoyed reading about the legends and various inhabitants that we, as humans, associate with Middle Earth, like the Sidhe, fairies, merpeople, etc. On the other hand, I cringed when reading about the descriptions of the cruelties different groups of living entities inflict on one another, be it personal harm or battles in war. Though the novel was set mainly in Ireland, during the time of Middle Ages (1300s), with a present-day preface and epilogue, many issues then are still prevalent now: war, religious conflict, ethnic conflict, political backstabbing, etc. Fictional characters are mixed people who once lived, like various British kings from the time, Popes from the time, et al. This was an absorbing read, just too much violence for my tastes.",

This story of conflict between the fairies (Shidhe), humans and the Church is rich with well-researched detail. The artful intertwining of facts with fiction and myth is so skillful, it\u2019s difficult to tell which is which. The engrossing story of Aisling, the magical half-goddess and young manifestation of the Morrigna, pulled me in and kept me up late reading. I hope there\u2019s more to come!",

There is absolutely nothing honest about this book, it is 100% complete fiction. Fantastical fiction. If one is really stretching it could by some be considered historical fiction as historical figures are mentioned but as they are portrayed as fantasy characters I would not classify it as such. Like a smoker that once he quits bemoans the evils of tobacco, the author reads like a excommunicated Catholic that cannot resist slandering the Vatican, Pope, Priests and in general all things Catholic. The book is very poorly organized, it jumps back and forth by centuries, months, decades, complete confusion. Threads are started and never finished. I gave it 2 stars because I did read it through until the end, if it were truly unfortunate I would not have and it would have been only one star. I won't recommend it to anyone in its present form, it would need a complete rewrite. I would suggest if the author wants to completely falsify so much with regards to historical individuals, rename the characters in the book so that they do not share the names of actual people that have once lived. Then straighten out the path, better organize the timeline so that the book flows in order. And either get over the Catholicism hatred or again, rename the completely fictionalized religion with a fictional name.",
