My only complaint would be that the cover is a little flimsy, but I really can\u2019t be too picky considering how cheap it was for the entire binding, so I\u2019m not knocking off any stars for that.Boyfriend seems to like it, so I overall recommend.",

It\u2019s obvious if you have read comics (good* comics) before that they didn\u2019t quite know what they were doing when setting up panels because some stories are hard to follow with the eye.The second story \u201cWinter\u2019s Spite\u201d has a few fighting scenes that lost me completely. And the third story is straight up confusing \u2014 there were moments of clarity, but over all the story was all over the place. Ironically, there\u2019s a misc story near the end that\u2019s drawn by a experienced comic artist, only 3 pages, and it\u2019s stark the difference.Overall, I don\u2019t regret buying this. If you\u2019re a fan of dark souls, buy it. At the very least it has gorgeous art, and it has a few fun pieces of lore (unsure if canon) that I thought were interesting!",

                "reviewText": "First off let me say I own all the individual comics to this complete collection and each of those has more quality than this heap of crap. The paper is of the lowest quality, the binding is just a thin layer of glue, and the actual cover of it is as thin as the pages. I don't understand why you would put together a complete collection that is this low quality at 34.99 US / 44.99 CAN / 31.00UK That's a good chunk of change and honestly if you are hitting close to 40 mid as well go to 40 and make it a hardback.Also what is up with all the trashy full capslock reviews on the outside of the book? It's horrible and takes away from the actual art and book its self. Here are a few examples, yes these are directly from the book \"STUNNING AND GRUESOME IN EQUAL MEASURE\" BY FLICKERING MYTH who the heck is flickering myth and why would I care what they think? Also stunning and gruesome in equal measure? Have they ever played dark souls? Jesus. The back is just as worse \"JAW-DROPPINGLY GORGEOUS FROM START TO FINISH\" - WE THE NERDY who the heck is \"we the nerdy\"? It's as if they found some group of losers who could not write school reports very well and asked them for one liners. Oh listen to this one guys \"THE FIRST COMIC TO CAPTURE THE ESSENCE OF THE VIDEO GAME ALMOST PERFECTLY\" - MULTIVERSITY COMICS who are you again? there are more comics? what in gods name are these horrible texts taking up the front and back. I will upload pictures of how stupid this stuff is for you guys to see yourself.As a collector this book is already in bad condition when it came because of how thin the pages and the cover is. It just feels bad in the hands and worse turning pages, like so bad you worry you will tear a page when you turn it. The thing could not make the journey in the envelope Amazon sent and has corner damage, and damage underneath. I just can't justify the price tag of this low quality product.TL:DR Low quality collection, super thin pages, horrible cover thickness and just feels bad. Get the individual comics if you want them this is not the go to.",

As a fan of the Dark Souls video game franchise, I bought it mainly for novelty, but it exceeded my expectations in many ways. The storyline and artwork were engaging, and the characters were well-developed. I particularly enjoyed the attention to detail and the way the comic book expanded on the lore of the game. Overall, I found it to be an enjoyable read and would recommend it to any fan of the Dark Souls franchise or anyone looking for an engaging comic book. The Dark Souls: Complete Collection comic book is a great addition to any collection and a must-read for fans of the series.",
