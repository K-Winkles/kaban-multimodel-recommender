                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The Tools of the Ghost is much deeper than it seems",
                "reviewText": "What a treat to discover a new book that is wonderfully original, slyly transgressive, cartoonishly violent, and by turns humorous, gross, and empowering. The Tools of the Ghost is much deeper than it seems, and fathoms more profound than many other books in its genre (sword and sorcery/urban fantasy). I was thrilled when the author, who is a friend, announced its publication.At the outset, we're plunged into a frightening scene in a cathedral a half-century ago in Poland. An otherworldly being has arrived to obliterate everyone present for reasons unmentioned, but one altar boy earns a life-saving escape for the children. Notably, he doesn't save his priest; it's understood that the priest doesn't deserve to live.The book re-opens as a young Indian-American woman in the FBI, Kiran Patel, is caught between her unstoppable desire to search for and save a group of kidnapped children, and the clear orders from her boss to stand down. She's already been failing at work, and she's reconsidering her career options at the recommendation of her boss and her mother. Then, ailing after an attack in their last mission together, Kiran's mentor-partner unexpectedly bequeaths his supernatural powers to her.Action ensues as this ordinary woman crosses over into a supernatural subterranean world, a bit like Alice going through the looking-glass. Details of the myriad injuries that characters subsequently suffer are fantastical in nature, but quite realistic in their descriptions, likely due to the author's real-life experience as an emergency room doctor.The pacing wavers a bit in the gooey center of this cookie, but keep eating. This book is packed with insights about the discovery of friendship, the lasting guilt of betrayal, the nature of honesty, the intersection of different religious beliefs, and more. Corny comments and one-liners keep the the writing at a faux-dark level and prevent it from ever becoming truly scary, so I would call this book appropriate for teens and tweens as well as adults, despite the plentiful curse words and graphic fight scenes. Woven throughout are references to multiple faiths from the perspective of other faiths. The three main characters were brought up Hindu, Muslim and Catholic; they are Americans of Indian (from India), African, and Mexican-Zapotec descent. It's particularly worth mentioning that this book holds a story that predates all three religions as its foundation.Nayak roguishly mixes graphic depictions such as, \"The Ghost twisted and there was a sickening crack. The man screamed as his left shoulder popped out of its socket and hung limp at his side,\" with cheesy meme-worthy wisecracks in the dialogue, and undeniably cute memorable little sentences like, \"She had no doubt the papers, left to their own devices in a dark drawer, would conspire against her and have little paper babies to further waste her time.\"The novel, set in Seattle, seems ready-made to be turned into a movie, complete with spectacular scenes of the Space Needle ablaze and crumbling, demon fights deep in the bowels of the Underground passageways of Pioneer Square, severed hands, fire-breathing toads, guitar-wielding warriors, and gelatinous tentacles. Its caressing introduction to Seattle's topography makes it a perfect gift choice for a Seattle native or tourist.",

With this purchase, you're buying a front-row ticket to the first of a lifetime of solid fictional works from the brilliant, glacially cool and debonair Mr. Nayak. At many points during the scrolling of this debut work, you'll get that itchy, electric feeling of holding nascent literary thriller mastery in your virtual hands.Tools of the Ghost builds from a strong dark/paranormal/urban/fantastical cross-genre premise into a densely plotted page-turner rife with explosive action, gritty characters fighting against world-destroying odds, and pithy one-liners. The world is full of gritty crime drama pairings of odd couple characters, but until now, no one has seen a match-up with a demon-slaughtering monster. Turner and Hooch has nothing on this book!Bonus points for this book's setting: the sparkling, sunny city of Seattle. Even as a non-native from a faraway town, he accurately captures its unique character, from its dark crevices to its iconic skyline. Where else can you find the Space Needle \"lit up red like a monument to Hell?\"",

When eleven children are kidnapped from their homes and taken by a cult, this mark ends up passing to Kiran. Suddenly, the Ghost has to work with a rookie FBI agent and two SPD officers to save the children across an urban fantasy landscape tangled with different cultures and religions.This was delightful and hilarious. The humor was irreverent, there were puns and dad jokes, and I deeply enjoyed all of the characters. This is a book unlike any other that I've read and Nayak is a refreshing new voice in the genre.I hope there is more to come.",

                "reviewText": "If there is one thing I do not do in reviews is to dissect the story. I believe the reader needs to read it for themselves to find their own meaning and enjoyment of a story well told. But I will tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it to be filled well in its weaving of many myths and faiths in the plot to ponder over and savor. It is a book in which I read the last page with a sigh, sorry the experience of being immersed in a great story had come to an end. I look forward to more stories of this trinity of unlikely heroes along with their Ghost.",

Then I was wanting the next book right away! I hope it will be out soon! Wonderful characters that may be far from perfect but I grew to like them, even the \"bad\" guys. Fun dialogue, great plot, love the dog, and need more now! Don't miss this hidden gem!",

                "reviewText": "I was lucky enough to read this novel in its early days, and I\u2019ve been obsessed with it ever since.FBI agent Kiran makes for a compelling protagonist as she gets sucked into a horrible, desperate situation that never should have come to be, the lives of innocent children at stake. I found myself bonding with her very quickly as she struggled to get her bearings and navigate a new reality that she never knew existed.As for the titular ghost\u2026I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but the writing there was AMAZING. As much as I like Kiran, he completely steals the show, and I hope the author writes more novels about his previous exploits.5/5 recommended. I will be reading it again.",

                "reviewText": "What happens when a misanthrope from another world (dimension?)---certainly someone who isn't human---a smart as a whip and sarcastic FBI agent and team of forever underestimated street detectives who are so much more than they appear, join forces to save group of children from the powers of hell?A hell of a lot of fun, that's what.I loved The Tools of the Ghost! It's a fast-paced action adventure, where you get the unlikeliest team coming together to save the day. This action packed book is part-mystery, part-thriller but so much more. It's about finding your humanity, which can be a tall order when you are literally the undead. I adore books about found families, so this was a huge plus for me. The highlight of the writing in my opinion was the crackling dialogues. There were so many laugh-out-loud moments. The characters have great chemistry between them, which makes for a very immersive reading experience. By the end, I couldn't wait to embark on another adventure with this team!Bonus points to Hemant for showing the complicated dynamic between Indian mothers and their daughters with so much humor and pathos. I would love to see Kiran's mom join the team in future books! She would be a great addition!",
