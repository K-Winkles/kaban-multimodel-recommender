There is even love, marriage, and children, not just a bunch of lewd scenes.That aside, this is very light, non-gory fantasy storytelling without a huge lot of murder. Plot armor exists to an extent, derived from Touya himself. I have read every book in this series and I will say you won't eventually hate this guy like Satou from \"Death March\" or that a-hole MC from \"Black \" Summoner\".",

                "reviewText": "If you enjoy the anime then I'd highly recommend the books. The anime has to cut out details to pack a lot of content into the season. Those details that you miss are really worth the time to read. IE Kohaku asks to stay by Touyo's side all of the time. Normally this is not possible since the summoned beast will consume the summoners magic to stay in the world. But Touyo has enough magic to keep a heavenly beast around all of the time. So from this one detail you can surmise that Touyo has amazing magic regenerative powers. The novels are light and the author actually types the books on his smartphone, kinda funny. Also the novels have some extra short stories at the end as well :)",

There was tons more character development in the LN than the anime. The only thing that really got me was the perspective of the story. It seems to be written in a first person style... kind of like you are the protagonist and you're hearing their thoughts as the story progresses... it was just a little confusing until I got used to it.",
