                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A very entertaining tale!",
                "reviewText": "This series, starting with the prequel, \u201cBattle at the River\u201d, is my first exposure to Mr. Bennett\u2019s writing - I\u2019m very happy I decided to try it. Judging from some reviews from 2017 or so, it appeared that perhaps those readers didn\u2019t realize the author\u2019s intent. Having started this reading in 2020, I noted that this story covers a lengthy time line. It contains a prequel, then a pair of books followed by a volume containing additional information, then repeating for three more pairs with a separating volume each, for a total of four cycles so far.The series is entertaining, but it does unwind a bit slowly to establish the important early history between the first two characters we meet. The prequel introduces Lord Richard Fitzwilliam, Baron of Bodden, a completely down-to-earth and fair-minded master strategist, and Sergeant Gerald Matheson, unshakably loyal to the Baron, who had taken him in as a stable boy after his family was killed in an outlaw attack, and later accepted him into the army. Gerald was a firm believer in constant training and strict discipline to keep his troops ready for battle. The men learned to completely trust one another, which made them a great team in combat. This relationship saves Gerald from complete devastation after being severely wounded in a local skirmish, when an inexperienced royal leader botched the conduct of the mission. Gerald, a commoner, was held responsible, because \u2018it couldn\u2019t possibly be the fault of a royal\u2019. The Baron asked Gerald to trust him as the Sergeant was cashiered out of the service with little means of support. The Baron arranged for Gerald to be hired as a groundskeeper for an estate in an outlying district, with undisclosed secret plans for his later services.In this first book, Gerald accepts his lot and tackles the work with his characteristic positive attitude. He meets Anna, a lonely six-year-old girl, later identified as the King\u2019s illegitimate daughter, who has been exiled to the boondocks to keep her out of the Queen\u2019s sight. The fellow exiles become allies and we watch as a strong, loyal father-daughter type of relationship develops as Anna come of age, with Gerald teaching her to take care of herself. The story has a few flat spots in following the daily routine, but there are frequent battles with raiders, so the people have to be constantly on guard, with daily training. New characters are added as the story progresses and we\u2019re given hints as to what lies ahead.I read for escape and entertainment; I\u2019m not put off by a bit of stretching the imagination. I thoroughly enjoyed the author\u2019s adept mix of medieval life and fantasy as he presented a heart-warming coming of age story in which Anna and Gerald earned their respect for each other. He was straight-arrow and steadfast in his principles. She learned to cope with duty by seeing both sides of issues in the friction between classes, developed a sense of honor in the struggle between good and evil, and gained bravery through training in defending their homes against attack. The story is well-written, with strong characters and vivid descriptions, to keep the reader involved. I am eager to read the rest of the series.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Well written and interesting, if flawed",
                "reviewText": "Here we have an interesting and well written, if flawed, book.Greg Patmore's narration is quite good. He has a good assortment of character voices and is good with inflections. The only things keeping him from a 5-star performance are the lack of tempo variations and the fact that his voices don't change as characters age. (Anna, for example, has the same choice at age six as she does at age thirteen)Now, the story, such as it is.First and foremost, I really feel that this should be a prequel rather than book one. We spend a lot of time with Gerald and get to know him very well. But unfortunately, he is NOT the protagonist.Based on the events depicted in the story and how it ends, it's really Anna and Beverly's story. I have so many unanswered questions, largely because there is almost nothing herein about Beverly's journey. On account of that, her role in the end feels almost like Deus Ex Machina.That being said, I really love Gerald as a character. He reminds me a lot of Eddard Stark. He's this super idealistic and honorbound warrior who really struggles to figure out how the world really works. And every time we turn around, someone is double crossing him and he only just makes it out with his head still attached to his shoulders.That being said, the comparisons to A Game of Thrones pretty much end there. Here we have a world that, while brutal, is not nearly so dark and gritty as that in GoT.There is an argument to be made for things working out just a little too conveniently, but I don't feel it goes far enough to break my belief or immersion in the world.There is a problem though. Unfortunately, this is not, in the strict sense, a story. It is an episodic narrative. We get to see lots of little vignettes, but the only thing connecting most of them is that we're following the same character(s) throughout.There is no overarching plot. There is no continual building of tension. And there was no defined beginning, middle, or end. All three of those points came only arbitrarily as there was nothing connecting them that required them to be where they were.Similarly, this book does a lot of jumping through time without talking about what happened in the interim and it was very distracting.And I have to wonder, what was the point of the 8-chapter flashback to Gerald's past?Yes, it helped to get to know him better, but all the pertinent points of his past were addressed later. And I can't help feeling that certain elements from his past could have made a great secret for Anna to delve into that could have been used to build both of their characters even more.Now, the point of view.In fairness, this is largely a style choice and personal preference. But it's a pet peeve of mine.The omniscient narration of this book was detrimental to my ability to connect with the characters. Throughout the entire book, there was an unnecessary distance from the characters because we weren't really inside any character's head. We were told their feelings and motivations (bouncing between characters with no warning at times, which was quite jarring), but at no point did we actually see the inner workings of any character's mind.Now, before you go thinking in just ragging on this book, I'm really not. It was very skillfully written and I can see the soul of a born storyteller behind it. It just needs a little work to turn into something incredible.Finally, as I've touched on already, the ending was less than satisfying. It felt like an arbitrary, \"let's just stop here.\"All that being said, I do recommend this book to anyone looking for authentic or semi-authentic feeling medieval fantasy that is perhaps a little less dark (and adult) than Game of Thrones.And I am continuing the series. With a little work, this author could be amazing and I'm really hoping to see him step it up in the next book.",
