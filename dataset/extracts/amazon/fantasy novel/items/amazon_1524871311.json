As Sorceline & her classmates compete to become Professor Archibald Balzar's apprentice, they'll investigate shadowy woods & mystical waters full of mythical creatures. Sorceline\u2019s always been gifted in her knowledge of cryptids, but on the Isle of Vorn she'll discover more about them & herself than she ever bargained for! Everything about this atmospheric school & the study of cryptozoology, & all the mythical creatures, plus Sorceline herself..so many things about her..are all just so fascinating, intriguing, & gripping. I love the secrets we discover about her, along WITH her that she didn't even know. Great cast of side characters as well. Can't wait for the next one. Highly recommend. The most STUNNING art by Paola Antista too.\ud83d\udc9c",
