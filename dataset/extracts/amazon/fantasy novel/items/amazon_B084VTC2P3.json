There were a lot of great scenes and chemistry between them, which made the pages fly by!Niamh and her accurate rock throwing; Mr. Tom and his willingness to serve (when he and Niamh aren\u2019t exchanging witty banter, that is!); Edgar dragging that body across the yard; and Austin, the alpha Jessie finds super attractive even if he is emotionally unavailable. This is a cast of unlikely characters all devoted to a common goal - helping Jessie unlock the magic of Ivy House, even despite creepy dolls, even despite her being a \u201cJane,\u201d and all to embrace her fully for who she is, the life she has led, and the power and wit housed within her spirit!This book was full of humor, magic, a touch of romance, and it was such great fun! Not to mention begonias. Haha!I will definitely be reading Book 2!",

The gross gladhanding for *~motherhood~*/ middle age and embracing yourself! As you are! Even with saggy tatas and wrinkles! Was pretty hard to swallow.Example: \u201cThe courage of a mother could not be measured. We toiled in the background, day in and day out, without thanks, so our children could become their best selves. We sacrificed ourselves for our loved ones, and we did it silently. Gladly. Full of love.\u201dIt would have feel more genuine if the main character didn\u2019t decide at the end to \u201clook just like I am\u201d EXCEPT except except (except no stomach, perky tatas, no body aches etc) versus looking \u201cyounger\u201d.

But this one... Is awesomeThe magical midlife series paints femme bodies midlife as perfectly acceptable and a cause to celebrate oneselfIt shakes off the societal norm of lining for our younger selves and instead celebrates that life can still be what you make of it.Totally addicted to this series (this is my second read through ;). )",

I'm a little in love with Edgar and think he should have gotten more screen time. But that's just me.If you are under forty and can't relate to the main character, that's ok. Just read it again in a couple of years. If you are forty or beyond, go for it. It is a lot of fun.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed this book slightly less than I had expected. The humour wasn't quite mine, the repetition of \"cracked up\" referring to things or characters being a bit off was frustrating, and I never quite understood the reason for Jacinta being called Jessie. What set me off the most, however, was that, while the author did a great job at presenting a woman in her 40s as still in her prime and in many ways a more aware and rounded human being, she seemed to just move the definition of decrepit. She doesn't have the same respect and understanding for characters who originally appear to be in their 80s (of course we find out they are significantly older than that, but the impression by Jacinta is that). Of course, people start slowing down, falling apart physically and at times mentally, but it seemed hypocritical.That said, I enjoyed the secondary character. I enjoyed the idea of the house and the paranormal world. I liked the shifters being so varied. It was entertaining, and I will read the next book. But I do hope that some more understanding is provided to the older paranormals.",
