        "description": "A Warhammer Age of Sigmar audiobook.The Siege of Excelsis is over, but the bloody battle has left its mark on the witch hunters Galen and Doralia ven Denst. When her father, Galen, disappears into the wilds of Ghur, Doralia sets off in pursuit, wracked with suspicions that Galen's quest may yet spell doom for all Excelsis. Listen to it because: discover the mysterious past of Galen and Doralia ven Denst, in a tale of mystery and revenge set in Ghur after the Siege of Excelsis.The story: the Siege of Excelsis is over at last, and the survivors count the costs amidst the rubble of their city. Even for Galen and Doralia ven Denst, two of the most feared witch hunters in the Order of Azyr, the horrors they have witnessed are not so easily dismissed. Struggling with the traumas inflicted by the siege, Doralia's concerns only grow when her father disappears into the wilds of Ghur. As she sets off on his trail, Doralia begins to suspect that Galen is hunting down a dark secret from their past - one that might hold the key to a new threat rising to engulf Excelsis. With the city barely recovered from its ordeal, both witch hunters must make a fatal choice between the desire for revenge and the rigours of duty - and should they decide poorly, Excelsis will pay the price.Written by Richard Strachan. Narrated by Helen Keeley. Read more",

                "reviewText": "First Helen Keeley, as the narrator for the audiobook does a spectacular job. She has done several of the Warhammer Horror novel narrations and they have been great. No exception here. She adds a certain feel of desperation that's fits the genre well. Second, Richard Strachan really does a nice job giving a fun version of Zombie Survival that fits the AoS setting very well. Best part, the Zombie Survival is not the central theme of the novel but a fairly well done plot-driver. No more spoilers but this was a lot of fun, worth your time, and of course a set up for a sequel! Enjoy!",

                "reviewText": "It's probably fair to say the author is not up there with the masters of the genre like Dan Abnett or Aaron Dembski-Bowden. He's likely one of a new generation of storytellers under contract with GW, still looking to find his style and leave his mark on the lore. But in all fairness to him: he's publishing stuff. I'm not. And it probably makes sense that GW is giving him minor characters in a relatively minor story arc to cut his teeth on.Having said that, unless you're a dedicated fan of the protagonists, don't expect too much. The author likely still subscribes to what I like to call \"the school of Awesome\", where events absolutely have to be catastrophic to create any tension, and characters larger than life to be noteworthy. The result is that the two main characters come across as shallow and clich\u00e9 - either that, or the author did an amazing job depicting two religious fanatics who really don't know any better than to trumpet self-righteous platitudes and threats at every turn. It gets old after a while. When you find yourself liking the supposed anti-hero, you know you have the wrong kind of heroes. But honestly, that vampire is a piece of work, she deserves her own novels. So there.The big fight at the end is pretty much just a grind without any real horror where you fast-forward past the slaughter of meaningless side characters.Granted, I'm giving this novel a lot of stick here. The author's style and skill will likely mature over time, and when they do, he deserves a shot at the big leagues.",
