                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been meaning to read Outlander for years. Part time travel, part historical fiction, big best seller\u2026 it\u2019s also fundamentally a Romance (cough). This last gave me pause, but finally, after checking out the show (to be reviewed later) I bit the bullet.It\u2019s funny how bestselling series drive against the current of writing \u201cshoulds.\u201d This book is long. It\u2019s detailed. The protagonist is often adrift without clear \u201cmotivation\u201d or \u201cagency.\u201d The prose can be highly redundant. There are countless scenes that don\u2019t serve the spine of the plot.But these \u201cproblems\u201d also help make for a good read, and a good read it is. Fundamentally this is a novel about interesting, and well developed (if sometimes problematic) characters, caught in an unusual and fascinating blend of setting and situation.Setup: It\u2019s 1945 and Claire Randall is a happily married nurse. On holiday in Scotland with her husband, a circle of ancient stones mysteriously teleports her to 1743. Stuck there, she meets and falls in love with sexy highlander Jaime Fraser against the backdrop of the coming Jacobite rising.This sounds fairly trite, and it is, but the historical detailing of 18th century Scotland is very well done. The author clearly did her research, and she builds a cast of interesting characters and a rather fascinating world on the edge of war. There is an intrinsic tension between Claire\u2019s two lives. Her modern husband isn\u2019t a bad guy at all, even if he lacks Jaime\u2019s manly-man energy. But she finds herself in this new place and in love \u2014 so what does she do? This dilemma provides for most of the conflict during the first two thirds of the novel.Let\u2019s back up and discuss prose and voice. Gabaldon is a good writer. Her prose is energetic and descriptive, often erudite. The voice is completely first person from Claire\u2019s POV. She has an engaging, if a bit overly clinical viewpoint. I had small problems with repetition. Gabaldon often repeats words a sentence later without reason of parallelism and has a tendency to elaborate on a point more than necessary. This is a book where a great deal of the subtext is in the text. Claire spells it out. Sometimes twice. Sometimes thrice. This, by the way, is another of those writing \u201cshoulds.\u201d You\u2019re not supposed to \u201ctell,\u201d but \u201cshow\u201d (imply). That\u2019s \u201cbetter writing.\u201d But as far as I can tell, bestsellers don\u2019t tend to be subtle.There is a lot of Scottish accented dialog in this book, and it\u2019s very well handled.Claire\u2019s POV is generally excellent, but it does result in a few issues. Occasionally (particularly in the later part of the novel) some events occur \u201coff screen\u201d (when she isn\u2019t there). Gabaldon then results to gratuitous retellings where other characters relate the event to her in unlikely detail. Occasionally, a briefer recounting leads to some reader confusion. Claire is also hyper aware and overly clinical. As the author likes to handhold us through her thought process, it sometimes feels like exactly this, author handholding rather than genuine cognition. This leads to one of my bigger \u201cmotivational gripes\u201d with this generally excellent novel, that Claire often feels fairly selfish and overly analytic. Particularly in the middle of the novel, Claire is nominally still plotting to head back to the future, but this tell feels incongruous with the emotions the author has her \u201cshow\u201d toward Jaime.As I mentioned, the historical details are good. The attitudes of the 18th century men and women are well handled and relatively free of anachronism. Things are properly grungy, sexist, and occasionally brutish. It is occasionally a little odd that Claire herself is not terribly discomforted by this. She points out plenty of good stuff, particularly having to do with justice, medicine, and punishment, but she doesn\u2019t really seem to miss toilets, showers, medical care, comfortable clothes, or well preserved food. Perhaps her life as a nurse during WWII was grungy enough to prepare her. She occasionally mentions discomforts flipply, but less than I\u2019d imagine. She never really complains (or seems to suffer) with regard to food, sleeping in haystacks, or walking barefoot across the chilly Scottish moors.The time travel element is very light SciFi/Fantasy in this first novel at least, but is used to good effect. There is no mumbo-jumbo explanation to gum things up.Being a romance, and a fairly erotic one, this is also a novel full of sex. Jaime and Claire go at it like rabbits \u2014 and things are often fairly explicit, at least in a literary way. I have no problem with most of this, as it\u2019s actually pretty hot, and I imagine that for many women it\u2019s insanely hot (see, word repeated deliberately for effect!). But there are aspects to the sexuality in this novel that are weird. Two huge ones (spoiler alert):1) In the middle, after Claire disobeys him, Jaime \u201cpunishes\u201d her by strapping her bare ass (to put it bluntly). To tell the truth, his reasoning is perfectly typical by 18th century standards, but comes off as a bit twisted by ours. And some readers will be bothered by the otherwise very spunky Claire\u2019s fairly rapid absolution of her wife-beating lover. In fact, it\u2019s clear that Gabaldon has a bit of a \u201cthing\u201d for corporal punishment as it\u2019s a constant theme in the book. Jaime goes way overboard to emphasize how much hiding her turned him on.2) More disturbingly, Gabaldon probably isn\u2019t the biggest fan of Homosexuality. The novel\u2019s villain (Black Jack) is not only gay, but she goes to great lengths to integrate his evil tendencies and his sexual proclivities. Otherwise, he\u2019s actually a rather excellent villain, but she goes big time overboard in Jaime\u2019s recounting of the intensely odd and twisted \u201cfinal hours\u201d between Jaime and the menacing Black Jack. It\u2019s pretty darn nasty and twisted. This, along with a retelling of an older encounter between Jaime and a gay Duke feels like an overzealous attempt to demonize\u2026 to quote the novel: \u201cpoofters.\u201dOverall, this is an excellent novel. None are perfect, and it\u2019s engaging throughout. The place/time is vividly depicted, and the characters are boldly executed. Both stay with you \u2014 which is no small feat for any author.Andy Gavin, author of Untimed and The Darkening Dream",

                "reviewText": "I love this book series so much, that I\u2019ve been dying for an opportunity to read it again. However, since I\u2019ve been so busy reading all the other books on my TBR Pile, my curiosity wasn\u2019t piqued enough to pick up the novel again until the premiere of STARZ\u2019s cable series, adapted from Diana Gabaldon\u2019s best-selling novel, this fall. As I watched the cable network\u2019s adaptation, I began to question certain small things in the episodes as to whether they happened in the book. Finally, my curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to read Outlander again for the first time in two years.The Good\u2026:The world Diana Gabaldon creates in her Outlander series is so rich, that I want to savor every little detail. From the characters\u2019 clothing to Claire\u2019s medical applications, it\u2019s hard not to get sucked into 1743 Scotland along with Claire Beauchamp Randall Fraser. Aside from the way of life during this time period, Gabaldon has created an interesting array of characters that keep you on your toes.At the heart of the story is Claire. She\u2019s a former trauma nurse who served during World War II, and is on a second honeymoon with her husband Frank Randall in the Scottish Highlands, when Claire unexpectedly finds herself traveling back through time 200 years into the past. While there she meets the other man in her life, James Fraser. It\u2019s hard to see which man Claire should end up with initially since they\u2019re both kind and loving, but as the story progresses you begin to wonder how she can ever leave Jamie.\u201cYou\u2019re mine, mo duinne. Mine alone, now and forever. Mine, whether ye will it or no. Aye, I mean to use ye hard, my Sassenach,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want to own you, to possess you, body and soul. I mean to make ye call me \u2018Master,\u2019 Sassenach. I mean to make you mine.\u201d \u2013 JamieJamie\u2019s family, friends, and foes also add color to this magical story. His uncles Colum and Dougal are incredibly mysterious. Sometimes they seem like uncles anyone might have in their family, yet other times they seem like they may be enemies parading as friends. Trying to figure out their motivations add an element of mystery as Jamie and Claire begin to navigate the complicated politics of this time. That in Scotland itself, and within the clan system in the Scottish Highlands.As for enemies, Jamie and Claire seem to find them around every corner. The main villain in this story is \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Randall, Claire\u2019s husband Frank\u2019s six-times great-grandfather. This British officer is a horrible, horrible person, and the fact he\u2019s the spitting image of Frank carries complications of its own. For Claire, it means she miscalculates the horrors \u201cBlack Jack\u201d is willing to inflict on others. For me as a reader, it means I find myself for hating Frank by association. I keep having to remind myself that they aren\u2019t the same person.The Bad\u2026:Since Outlander is set in the 18th century, many things that happen to the women in this story are fitting within the time period. When reading this novel, you must remember this fact, and that what the women go through was pretty common and accepted. However, it\u2019s not only the women that run into a bit of violence in the book. Jamie, in particular, is a victim of violence that is quite graphic. So if you are a bit squeamish, you may want to skim those scenes. Then again, those events have lasting repercussions throughout the series, so\u2026 maybe not.\u201cI gave you justice, it said, as I was taught it. And I gave you mercy , too, so far as I could. While I could not spare you pain and humiliation, I make you a gift of my own pains and humiliations, that yours might be easier to bear. \u201d \u2013 JamieAnother aspect of the story that may give readers pause is how homosexuality is viewed in the book by the characters. This viewpoint was also common for that time, so if you are a bit sensitive to LGBTQ issues, you may want to fortify yourself. One of the characters in the book is homosexual, and happens to be in the precarious situation of being in the British military. In the 18th century, not only would he lose his position and be ruined if his sexuality came to light, but he would also be imprisoned. This aspect to the character gives a certain light to his actions in the story which I won\u2019t divulge due to spoilers. Sorry!Do I Recommend?YES! YES! YES! Outlander isn\u2019t a world-wide best-selling novel for no reason. It\u2019s a fantastical tale of romance that withstands time and space. It\u2019s a mystery about a woman far from home who doesn\u2019t know how she got where she is, or how to get back. It\u2019s a paranormal romance of a woman in love with two different men separated by 200 years. It\u2019s a historical fiction story set in 18th century Scotland during the Jacobite movement in the time of the clans, and witch trials. It\u2019s and adventure story about a young man who acted rashly and nearly lost his life in lieu of his freedom. A wanted man who years to return home to his family, and be the man he was meant to be. This story has something for everyone, and will not disappoint. To date there are eight books (and counting) in the series, so now is the time to jump in and see what all the buzz is about. Since this novel is amazing, hard to put down, and somehow managed to be even more wonderful the second time around, I give it 5 out of 5 stars.",

I found myself staying up late and getting up early to read whenever I could.I will say the last two hundred pages or so tore me up. I\u2019m still shivering from what Jamie experienced.Yes, it has spicy parts. Yes, it has some gruesome, violent parts. Yes, you should 100% read Outlander!",

In the end I found it held my interest, though a bit slower paced than I prefer. The characters were well developed, and the author created each scene skillfully. At this point I am undecided as to whether or not I will continue the series.",

                "reviewText": "If this was Diana Gabaldon's \"practice\" book, I am in awe of her writing prowess. As someone who is hooked onto the Outlander TV series, it took me a while to get around to reading the book. It is incredibly detailed\u2014far more than the average historical romance\u2014and makes others look shallow and poorly researched and whimsical in comparison. The relationship between Jamie and Claire is very REAL, with all its ups and downs fleshed out in detail, and Claire's character has been so beautifully constructed that I'm convinced Caitriona Balfe was an excellent choice for the role. Additionally, another beautifully written character was Jenny Murray, n\u00e9e Fraser, also perfectly cast and portrayed in the series. I learnt a lot about Scotland and honestly found myself glad at times that I live in times where women aren't so easily condemned as witches. My only grouse with the book is that it was a tad too long\u2014I felt there were some details that could have been edited out to maintain the pace and stay on track. While the length per se isn't a problem, sometime too much detail takes away from the narrative flow. Nevertheless, it was a beautifully written and researched work and Diana Gabaldon is a gifted writer with a wonderful way with words. And I'm glad that the TV series has remained quite loyal to the original source material and has not changed too much, and has retained the soul of the work while adjusting to the need for brevity in each episode.",
