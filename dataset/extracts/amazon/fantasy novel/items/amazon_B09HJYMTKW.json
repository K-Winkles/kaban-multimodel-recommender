                "reviewText": "Review Summary: Not a bad read on KU/Kindle. Does include sex/steam/spicy elements and series does get darker as it continues. Series of 4 books, final book to publish in Dec 23.Full review:Beyond the Veil is Book 1 in the Flesh and Bone series, 3 of which are written and 1 of which is due out Dec 24. The series does include explicit sex/steam/spice, which increases in frequency and scope as the series progresses. Other trigger warnings include issues curse words/foul language, physical and sexual abuse, exhibitionism, elements of captivity, and lack of free will/choice.Book 1 introduces us to Estrella, a harvester that works in a city where the human realm and fae realm meet. Centuries ago a barrier, called the Veil, was erected between the worlds to block out the fae, who reportedly wreaked havoc upon humanity. Once a year, the village conducts a ceremony to supply the necessary power to keep the veil stable.Except this year, something changes, and the Veil falls. Estrella discovers that she is not just the poor harvester she thought she was, but one of the fae marked, which means the correspondingly marked fae is assuredly going to hunt for her. Things are complicated when the human realm\u2019s own soldiers, the Mist Guard, hunt down the fae marked as well. The fae want the marked to increase their power; the Mist Guard want the marked to kill them to prevent it. Running scared with her brother, Estrella has nowhere to go and no time to figure things out. It\u2019s a race for her life to try to outrun both man and fae if she has any hope at all to keep her freedom.During her journey Estrella meets Caellum, another fae marked who agrees to help her. After all, he needs to run too. Only trouble is the longer they run together, the more alluring Caellum becomes, and Estrella doesn\u2019t know quite what to make of things if she\u2019s to guard her freedom and her heart.Beyond the Veil is a lead in to a fated mates style story. If you swap \u201cfae\u201d with \u201cwerewolf,\u201d you\u2019ve got a pretty good idea how the series as a whole develops. Book 1 is fun because we get to watch Estrella, navigating a dangerous world with nothing more than the clothes on her back and a borrowed dagger, trying to flee the forces chasing her. Characters do die in this novel, and Estrella is torn between grief over their passing, fear about what might be if she is caught, self-interest vs. helping others, and anxiety about developing further bonds that will likely only serve to hurt or confuse her further.The foreshadowing in the book I think is fairly obvious, but the worldbuilding established throughout the book was fun. The series borrows from a handful of myths and legends, including the Wild Hunt, Norse, Irish, and Celtic legends, and eventually some Greek/Roman influences. Caellum is a decided and unabashed flirt, which Estrella struggles to handle in light of her own history and upbringing. The pair do eventually bond closer, though some moments do feel a little high pressure and manipulative.Worth a Kindle Unlimited Read, library rental, or the $5 e-book buy. Wouldn\u2019t quite pay the $16 paperback cost myself, definitely not the $23 hardcover cost, for this story.Book 2, What Hunts Inside the Shadows, requires Estrella to face some of her own prejudices and the sex/spice/steam increases exponentially\u2026but that is for another review.",

From the very first few chapters, you'll find yourself unable to put the book down. We start our journey by meeting Estella, who I feel in love with right a way. She refused to conform to what society says she should be even when threat/use of physical pain (check trigger warnings). This independence is what starts this amazing journey, which I won\u2019t say more about, so I won't give anything away.Then, we meet Caelum, who I must say is everything we want in a MMC. Sing along, \"He's morally grey, what can I say, Grey's my favorite color.\" Caelum is our possessive alpha that can be an a-hole to everyone that is not Estella. The chemistry between Estella and Caelum will ignite the pages with some \ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd75\ud83d\udd25 scenes (exhibitionism, praise, breeding - please check triggers) that will have you fanning yourself.This book was a fun read with great banter, character, and plot development and will leave you wanting more. Fortunately for us, the next two books in the series are already available, promising even more excitement.",

                "reviewText": "\"What lies beyond the veil\" is the perfect example of how SJM should have written ACOTAR. The lore is carefully constructed throughout the book, causing the expansion of the world in which it takes place to feel organic. The characters are based on rather simple archetypes and I found them a little cliche sometimes, but the simple yet beautiful writing combined with the delightful banter and passion of the protagonists make this story everything a 'fae romance' should be. This one is for those who don't feel ashamed to admit they like their smuts as dirty as possible, aned their MMC the darker shade of morally grey there is.",

                "reviewText": "Wow! I had heard this book was good, but it defied all expectations! I knew from the first page that I was going to enjoy it, but I could not put it down and I even took it out on my day trip today. I finished it about half an hour ago and was so happy that there was an extra chapter to download from Caelum\u2019s POV.So what did I like so much about it? Not only was it extremely well written, but the world building, and the character development was amazing. The character development being the strongest part of the book in my opinion. I also felt that there were three parts to this book, with the ending leading nicely into the second book.In the first part we are introduced to Estrella and learn about the life she lives in Mistfell, which is one of poverty and degradation at the hands of the Lord of the manor and the priestesses cane. This part gave me Handmaids tale vibes, in the way in which women were treated and basically expected to stay pure until marriage when they were expected to reproduce. I loved the way that despite doing things she would rather not do. but wanting to ensure the safety of her mother and brother, Estrella found little ways to be defiant, such as escaping to the woods at night. She was likeable from the start and Lord Byron was suitably unpleasant as befits a perfect love to hate character.The second part of the book involved Estrella and her brother Brann. I don\u2019t want to give any spoilers, but this is the first time we get to know Brann and it is clear that, while trying to protect his sister, he is also keeping secrets. It is during this part that we are introduced to Caelum. From the first line he spoke I knew I was going to love this giant of a man. There were several descriptions of where certain parts of Estrella\u2019s body came up to on him, and I was quite perturbed how the tiny Estrella was going to cope in a romantic relationship with him. But cope she did, though not until part three.Part three focused on Estrella and Caelum\u2019s developing relationship and the impact this has on the people they meet. It was during this part of the book that my affection for Caelum began to wane. As he and Estella became more involved, his possessiveness began to irk me, and I felt that at some points it bordered on aggressiveness towards her. There were a couple of throat grabbing incidents that made me want to knee him in his very impressive manhood. However, I feel that this wariness of his character was fully intentioned by the author and towards the end of the book, some of these things make complete sense.I loved how Estrella\u2019s character developed over the course of this story, particularly in terms of her feelings towards Caelum. She learns to defend herself physically and begins to listen to her instincts and not let herself be blinded by her infatuation with the man she loves. Caelum, however, goes through the most changes and my feelings towards him changed so many times. The bonus chapter that was available at the end of the book was a must read, as it brought my feelings about him full circle as I began to understand him and some of what he had suffered.I cannot wait to carry on this adventure and find out what is about to happen next as What Lies Beyond the Veil ended on a super exciting cliff hanger.A massive five star plus read.",

                "reviewTitle": "Toller Fantasy Romance",
                "reviewText": "Das Buch ist wirklich gut, es wird eine Fantasy Welt erschaffen, mit aspekten die man kennt, Hexen, Fae, Menschen und der grobe Grundriss dieser Welt. Hier hat man sich eindeutig von bereits bestehenden Werken inspirieren lassen, ich pers\u00f6nlich finde das nicht schlimm, nicht jeder kann komplett neu eine Welt erschaffen, sich also inspiriren zu lassen und vorhandenes zu nutzen, find ich nicht verkehrt.Den Schreibstil kann ich schwer beschreiben, klar ich lese recht gut englische Texte, fand den Stil also nicht schlecht oder unangenhem, wenn man aber Englisch flie\u00dfend spricht und perfekt liest, kann man das evt. anders beurteilen.Das nutzen von vorhandenen Spezies, Orten und \u00e4hnlichen, find ich gut gemacht, \u00e4hnlich wie bei Stadt der Finsternis, wo vorhande Mythen genutzt wurden und gut in die Geschichte mit aufgenommen wurden.Die Charaktere sind klassische Fantasy Figuren, nichts neues, aber gut. Caelum ist zu beginn ungew\u00f6hnlich aber nett, nimmt sehr schnell eine besch\u00fctzer Rolle ein, Estrella steht f\u00fcr ihn \u00fcber allen anderen.Den weiblichen Hauptcharakter find ich pers\u00f6nlich sehr angenehm. Sie ist weder ein sch\u00fcchternes M\u00e4uschen noch kriegerisch und Stark. Sie f\u00fcgt sich teilweise ihrer Rolle in der Welt, l\u00e4sst sich aber nicht alles gefallen. Hat ihre kleinen Geheimnisse und kleinere Vergehen oder ist manchmal in seltenen Situationen aufs\u00e4ssig, ich fand sie also sehr nat\u00fcrlich und sympathisch. Besonders weil sie sowohl Sachen hinterfragt, als sich aber auch einfach mal von Gef\u00fchlen blenden l\u00e4sst, wies eig jedem passiert.Sie hat weder irgendwelche extremen super kr\u00e4fte oder mega Wissen, noch ist sie ein dummchen das man als Leser eher als st\u00f6rend empfindet.Der m\u00e4nnliche Hauptcharakter war f\u00fcr mich schnell durchschaut. Wenn man Anf\u00e4ngt zu lesen wei\u00df man wo der Hase l\u00e4uft. Was ich nicht schlimm fand, es war ja eig. abzusehen. Wer er aber zu 100% ist, das war nicht sofort klar. Er hat f\u00fcr sich festgelegt das er sie sch\u00fctzt, vor allen anderen, jeder andere Mensch hat f\u00fcr ihn nur einen zweiten Rang. Das muss man m\u00f6gen, wenn das f\u00fcr einen, selbst in einem Fantasy Buch, zu unmoralisch wird, weil das leben einer Person \u00fcber das anderer gestellt wird, dann ist das Buch nichts f\u00fcr einen. Er ist sehr offensiv in seinen ann\u00e4herungs versuchen, f\u00fcr mich aber nicht unangenehm, denn er achtet ihre Grenzen, sie m\u00f6chte es nicht, dann macht er es nicht. Er sagt ihr wenn er sich nicht kontrollieren kann, so das sie gehen kann, wenn ihr das denn gerade wichtiger ist. In Fantasy Romance mag ich m\u00e4nnliche Charaktere wie Caelum, sieht man daran das ich Buchreihen mag wie die Immortals von Kresley Cole, Black Dagger, Gestaldwandler und Gilde der J\u00e4ger (Nalini Singh), er hat teilweise den vibe wie m\u00e4nnliche Charaktere dieser B\u00fccher.Ich werde den n\u00e4chsten Teil auf jeden Fall lesen, hoffe das das ganze nochmal in Deutsch rauskommt und es evt. auch noch mal mehr geben wird.",

There are similar themes but the author managed to create her own story! That was actually very good! It took me out of my reading slump! Can it be part of my favorite shelf ? I don't know, I'll see with the 2nd book that I already pre-ordered, can't wait to read it! The cliffhanger is predictable but still so good when you read it! That's definitely a 5 \u2b50!!",
