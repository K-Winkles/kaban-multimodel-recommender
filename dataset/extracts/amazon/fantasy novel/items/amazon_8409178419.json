Swiontek\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \"What a great read. I can't wait to read the next book in this series\" -J. Michael. From the Author Get to know I.M. Redwright!Let's start talking about your amazing new Ya fantasy book series, how long is The Sword's Choice going to be?I plan it to be a four volume series, each taking place in one of the four kindoms. But you know how this works, you never know for sure... but that's the idea at least.Do you write your books for tweens, teens, or adults? do you write for a specific target?I don't actually have a target in mind, however, anyone that is older than 11 year old will enjoy my stories. Lots of adults have read my first young adult book and have really enjoyed it, and same goes for teenagers, so I'm happy about it!If you didn't write fantasy adventure books for teens and adults what would you write?That's a good question, I would probably write scifi, and I probably will at some point. However, I don't plan to do this until I have my Young Adult fantasy series finished.Let's get serious now, where would you rather write: a noisy coffee shop or a quiet library?Uh, I am quite used to writing in the most awkward places, so I would go for the noisy coffee shop, as long as they serve a decent coffee with milk of course.Do you listen to music while you write?I usually do, It's way more fun that way!"

I definitely recommend it for anyone over the age of 11 that likes fantasy.\"\"A fascinating medieval world, with magical swords, elemental kingdoms, and contains positive messages about never giving up.\"What is it about:But once a year, the skies burn red. Upon this day, the Fire Kingdom\u2019s priests perform their ritual: each newborn\u2019s palm is lacerated, opened with a sacred sword, for Firia\u2019s next ruler will be seen to shed no blood. Long ago, Noakhail had been driven from the Fire Kingdom as an infant\u2014forced to escape with his noble father. They\u2019d wanted to kill him simply because he was next in line for the crown . . .Now, Noakhail has grown, and the swordsman won\u2019t give up until he claims the throne and his birthright. But pure resolve may not be enough. He first must face grave danger as he cuts across the four kingdoms with his fire sword.Meanwhile, Princess Vienne is mistreated by her elder sisters. Shy and soft-spoken, she couldn\u2019t be more unsuitable to rule the Queendom of Water. Alas, the Aqua Deus can be capricious, and the fates aren\u2019t clear. Vienne will have to prove that she is capable of mastering the sacred water sword if she should hope to reign with pride. Unbeknownst to Noakhail and Vienne, their tales run parallel . . . and only one result can lie ahead: a ruthless battle. Read more",

Instead, the citizens in each of the 4 kingdoms have hair and eye color of a different color. That's right, in the Queendom of Water (so called because it can only be ruled by a woman) they all have blue eyes like the sea and blond hair, while in the Kingdom of Fire their hair is coal black and their eyes are brown, so it is easy for them to detect if there are any foreigners infiltrating their domain. And what happens if a baby is born from the love relationship of citizens of two different kingdoms? Good question, welcome to the engaging lore of the world of The Sword's Choice.",

                "reviewText": "My first thought, as I read the last words of The Swords Choice \u2013 The Sapphire Eruption by I.M. Redwright was, \u201cWhat? It\u2019s over??? Oh man, what a bummer.\u201d That\u2019s because I absolutely loved this author\u2019s story-telling and did not want to stop reading. Luckily, the story continues in Book 2 so I will have an opportunity to read the full accounting.There\u2019s so much depth and history throughout this book that it was easy to feel like I was immersed in Noakh, the phoenix\u2019s world. Being a fan of Piers Anthony, I absolutely love it when an author assigns special meanings to words. In this case, the main character\u2019s name, Noakhail, means \u201cDon\u2019t Give Up\u201d and through many trials and tribulations, he completely lives up to that admonition.Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are many times when he is on the verge of throwing down his sword, so to speak. Wondering whether he will or won\u2019t is what keeps the story moving along so swiftly. There are so many perils and situations that are full of action and adventure that there\u2019s not a moment of boredom in the entire book. It reminded me a lot of The Sword In The Stone by T.H. White amongst many other rich, epic Arthurian fantasies. I also loved the idea of a world containing four separate elemental kingdoms.Oh yes, I forgot to say, Noakh comes from the Fire Kingdom where a \u201cphoenix\u201d is chosen to become the new king. Since it happens so early in the story, it\u2019s not really a spoiler to say that he is chosen to be that phoenix when he is a little baby and things go so awry that he must be spirited away to a safe place to avoid being murdered.There are many other characters to be admired in the book but I have only concentrated on Noakh, here, because he was my favorite. The review, itself, would be as long as a book if I delved too deeply into the others. Suffice it to say, this is a great read. Check it out for yourself.",

                "reviewText": "It's been awhile since I read a pure, sink-into-the-world fantasy, and this one was a treat.Noakhail has grown-up alone with, what he thought, was his father. Every day, he's been trained to become a mighty warrior...for as long as he can remember. When his father presents him with a magical fire sword and discloses that Noakhail is actually the chosen king of the fire nation, Noakhail soon finds himself on a dangerous and adventure-rich path to save more than just his kingdom. At the same time, the twin sword, a water sword, needs to chose the future queen, and everyone in the kingdom believes it will be the current princess in Aquadom, but the choice has yet to be made. With the growing threat of Noakhail's presence, things are even more unsure.This tale pulls in from the first page and drives forward the entire way through. While the first pages grab the reader in and make the danger of the situation immediately clear, the world-building and character depth isn't far behind. Noakhail's personality holds all that a great hero needs, and his uncertainty makes him instantly likable. His relationship and the occurrences with his so-called father seal the deal before the adventure and action really kicks in.Secrets and dangerous intrigue keep the tension high as both Noakhail and the princess try their best to do what they see as being right. It's a nicely done weave, which keeps the reader bound to the pages. Add this to the more direct writing style, and it makes for a read which is easy to pick up and settle in with. It will be exciting to see where the adventures go next.",

                "reviewText": "It only happens one time a year. The sky turns red and the Fire Kingdom\u2019s priests have their cutting ceremony of infant\u2019s little palms. However, when young Noakhail proves his calling, an evil opponent attempts to kill him. A soldier intercedes, and runs away with Noakhali to a place called Aquadom. Years later, Noakhail\u2019s truthful self is revealed which is enthralled with a strong, fiery nature. There is a lot taking place in this story. The author has a great imagination and has utilized it well in writing such a complex tale. There were numerous twists and turns in the plot which were great surprises. The theme concentrates on four kingdoms, initiated on four foundations: Earth, Water, Fire and Air. Also, there is an interesting concept of the great nations, Fieros, Aquos, Thirhans and Aertians. The Sapphire Eruption: An Epic Adventure (The Sword's Choice Book 1) is unique but at the same time in the category of classic. Not a single character was boring. All played a vital part. The magnificent setting of an innovative fantasy novel was brought vibrantly to life with detail and descriptions, intricately woven into the textile of the realm.",

With the red sky calling for the ritual to be held by sword to determine the next ruler of the kingdom and the fight to protect the chosen one gives a great pull to the reader. The story included lots of adventure and was greatly descriptive. I felt like I was in the book. I will be looking for book 2 in this series and will definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The Sapphire Eruption is an excellent fantasy novel with many classic elements. It is an exciting escape into a perilous world, populated by four warring lands ruled by ruthless kings and queens, who do not deserve to wield power. Surprising new rulers are anointed in mystical ceremonies in which the powerful and possessed swords chose their heirs to the kingdom. But these choices come at a price, as the swords don\u2019t automatically offer allegiance and control to their owners; who have to earn the right to possess these potent weapons.Noakhail survives the ascendency ceremony by a narrow escape and develops his swordsmanship skills with the help from his adopted father, Lumino. His relationship with the sword is always fraught and double-edged. Vienne is chosen as future Queen of Aquadom. However, she is unsure of herself and sceptical of her powers, leaving others in her kingdom, including her own sister, to take advantage of her weakness and plot against her.These two unlikely heirs to the supreme power of the swords are set on a dangerous collision course in the first book of a very promising series.",

                "reviewText": "Deeply immersive start of an Amazing Saga!Such a gripping epic tale, that you can almost hear the rich symphonic theme music play in the background as Noakhail\u2019s dramatic story unfolds. From page one, you are instantly immersed in a very descriptive fantasy world filled with amazing places, dozens of memorable characters, and centuries of detailed history and political intrigue as each faction wrestles for power, from both inside and outside each of the kingdoms. This reminds me so much of Avatar the last airbender with the four kingdoms of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.No words have been wasted. Every intricate detail holds some significance, all the way down to the tiniest droplet of water, but you\u2019ll want to discover that on your own. Impressive Battles and Tournament scenes incite a rush of emotion as the reader cheers for their favorite heroes, or some rather dastardly villains! It was honestly difficult to set this book down. The action and adventure forces you to keep flipping pages deep into the evening. I literally finished the final page at 2a.m. I can\u2019t wait for the story to continue in volume 2!",
