                "reviewText": "I bought this for my middle school daughter for Christmas and read it before I wrapped it. There need to be more stories like this for kiddos to read who want to know that there are people like them out there. It mixes a sweet coming of age lesbian story with fantasy (a selkie, yay!) and it deals with two facets of LGBTQ coming of age: one girl is afraid of what may happen to her relationships when she comes out and the other girl is perplexed that anyone would worry about sharing truth about who they are. The art is sweet: the selkie girl is chunky, the human girl is of Asian background and both are beautiful. I love the inclusivity and the unapologetic inclusion of cartoon girls kissing. Lovely artwork with human selkies having a slight seal appearance. Bravo and I hope the author creates many more.",

                "reviewText": "Very cute coming of age story involving Canadian Korean teen Morgan and a selkie named Keltie. Fast, light read with good pacing, good story, good development for Morgan when it came to accepting herself and building her relationships with her friends and family.I liked the way the selkie mythology was incorporated. (Although it made me so anxious when Morgan took Keltie's seal skin and was casually wearing it. I was so afraid it'd be seen as negative or she'd lose it or something but that part of the mythology wasn't mentioned as part of the story so I had to let it go and believe it wasn't important if Keltie didn't say it was important.)Some of the minor characters had some tidbits of story here and there but I would say they weren't really developed. That was slightly disappointing because it felt like the one friend Serena was supposed to have more of a little arc of her own but it didn't feel properly fleshed out.The ending was bittersweet but for the best.",

                "reviewText": "TLDR: this is a beautiful book about innocent love and overcoming fears. It is definitely worth a read.I grew up in a very homophobic, bigoted religious household. Being anything except heterosexual felt like the end of the world and brought along a lot of fear and self hate. After starting the journey of unlearning thoughts and behaviors brought on by the trauma, I wanted to go back and help heal the inner child that was so afraid to just be herself. I decided that a good place to start was normalizing the lgbtqia+ community, especially in an innocent context. This book is a beautiful work of art. Not only are the drawings and color palette amazing, but the message is too. All of the characters\u2019 emotions are portrayed so well through detailed animated body language and the colors are SO vibrant. The themes in the book are equally beautiful: be yourself and prioritize open, honest communication. This was such a wonderful place to start a self healing journey for me\u2014and wherever you are in your journey through life, this book would be a great addition.",

                "reviewText": "Uma HQ linda, apaixonante, necess\u00e1ria e surpreendente! The girl from the sea, da estadunidense Molly Knox Ostertag, j\u00e1 foi publicada aqui no Brasil, o que \u00e9 uma not\u00edcia \u00f3tima porque eu indico demais essa hist\u00f3ria.Nela conhecemos a humana Morgan e a selkie Keltie, e acompanhamos o relacionamento rom\u00e2ntico entre elas. O quadrinho traz temas como primeiro amor; impactos negativos no meio ambiente; amizade; confian\u00e7a; fam\u00edlia; autodescoberta e muito mais.O que me fez gostar tanto foi, al\u00e9m da arte muito bonita, que a autora mostra situa\u00e7\u00f5es muito reais de um jeito leve, mas que mesmo assim faz o leitor se questionar, seja em como vemos o mundo ou como vemos a n\u00f3s mesmos e as pessoas que est\u00e3o ao nosso redor. \u00c9 uma hist\u00f3ria muito bonita, que poderia facilmente ser um conto de fadas.Prepare-se para se emocionar (e at\u00e9 derramar algumas l\u00e1grimas). Terminei j\u00e1 querendo reler.",
