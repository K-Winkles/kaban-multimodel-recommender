This book is full of sinister plots and deranged situations, ones that had me reeling with every twist and turn they took. There was drama, action, laughs, and tears. And a VERY spicy MMC that falls first and falls HARD!Each character was so well written, and the scenery so artfully explained that I could see and feel everything that was happening on the page. Ember Holt brought this world to life in the most amazing way that I know im going to be hooked until the very end. It was an absolute roller coaster that I am going to be buzzing from until I can get my hands on the next one!In conclusion, go get this book. Get it and all the others that come after it. You're going to want to keep them all as you lose yourself to the Princesses of Ruin and their hunky and fascinating loves. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

I love the way the characters were portrayed through the book and I am in awe of the details in the storyline that really pulled everything together.The FMC is a strong as heck woman who is no damsel in distress with awesome powers. But she also has trauma from her past that keeps her from fully allowing herself to feel emotion toward those she is closest to in life and she goes through a journey to heal with the help of the MMC and other characters who give her a little push in the right direction.The MMC\u2026 don\u2019t even get me started with how much I love him. He is the three sexy P\u2019s. Powerful, protective, and possessive. I love how he is the one who fell first and he will do everything in his power to keep her safe even if she doesn\u2019t let him.This book is a slow burn but becomes oh so steamy. It\u2019s got everything you could ever want. Fantasy, magical powers, spice, strong FMC, sexy MMC, and the suspenseful twists will have you on the edge your seat reading eagerly to find out what happens next! I strongly recommend it!",
