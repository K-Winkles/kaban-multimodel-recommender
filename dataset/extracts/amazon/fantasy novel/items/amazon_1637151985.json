                "reviewText": "\u2018The Snowcat Prince\u2019 by Dina Norlund is a stunning illustrated magical tale. I found it off the scale in terms of cuteness.It is the story of Syv, the youngest of seven snowcat princes. After the death of their father all of the princes are in line for the throne. As Syv is proving very popular with the citizens of the snowcat kingdom his brothers send him on a dangerous quest to locate a long-lost magical crown of their ancestor, the Eldking. Talk about sibling rivalry!Legend says that the snowcat who finds the crown will break the curse on their land and bring great honour to the family. Yet failure could lead to Syv being banished forever. During his journey he has to face the sand foxes - the sworn enemies of the snowcats. Along the way he meets Kit, a red-haired girl who calls him \u2018Snowball\u2019. She insists on joining him. It was a heartwarming story about bravery, honour, and loyalty. There\u2019s also an important theme within the narrative about history.I was entranced by Norwegian author Dina Norlund\u2019s storytelling as well as her exquisite artwork. Syv is drawn as the cutest little cat with such expressive features. In addition, her use of colour was very effective: utilising a cool palette with white, silver, and blues for the snowcats and a warm palette with reds and oranges for the sand foxes.In the Bonus Material Dina Norlund includes character sketches, maps, alternative covers, and details about the snowcats and sand foxes, including their magical powers.\u2018The Snowcat Prince\u2019 is a wonderful fantasy adventure that I am certain will appeal to readers of all ages.",
