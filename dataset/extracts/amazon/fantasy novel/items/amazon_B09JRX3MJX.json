                "reviewText": "I think most people pondering purchasing this novel are less concerned about the content of the novel itself and more if the physical copy of the book is worth it considering that it was online for sometime unofficially.I have moved to purchasing less physical books over the years and want to put my money in more 'investment pieces'. So, when I saw that all three of MXTX's novels were getting an official printing, I felt I should put my feet - er - money behind it. SVSSS is the series that I enjoyed the most and felt like it needed some love and that it was under rated since it is a comedy/parody and very fast paced. Honestly, it wouldn't work as a longer novel to keep the humor vibe.The actual physical book is nice; good weight, nice paper, clean, crisp and all that. Good font, the design at the top of the pages for the header is an extra touch that makes it feel fancier. I like the cover art and the french flaps make it a sturdier paperback and the illustrations inside are a bonus. Yes, I also liked the profiles for other charas on the back since they featured LQG. I will purchase the rest of the series for sure and already have pre-ordered the next volume.For us linguistically challenged individuals, the glossary at the back is helpful and it does its best to help us out with all of the letter combos in English that sound wise don't make sense aka why does zh-vowel = a j-vowel. I'm certain it isn't perfect, but at least gets the point across for a lot of the names and your guess is going to at least be better and will help you put things together if you do watch cdramas.It has a breakdown of key character names, and lots of wuxia/xianxia/cultural terms some that I knew already and others I didn't which is also helpful! Me thinking that yellow is a bad color = character death but actually just meaning they are wealthy (but do die at a high rate in these novels). It also has the huge list of martial arts specific relationship terms and hopefully, all of them will stick. I know it is always a huge debate with translators if it should be XXX-shimei or younger sister XXX.Price - is it worth it? I would say that it is absolutely worth it and it isn't expensive. It is well known that the publishing industry is tough and making money off of writing is difficult. If you consider that to publish this they needed to 1.) negotiate with MXTX and her agent 2.) pay the translators 3.) pay editors 4.) pay the illustrator 5.) pay typesetters/formatters 6.) pay the PR people, HR, support staff, sales reps . . . . and the list goes on it makes it clear that licensing an author like MXTX was a safe move with her works already published in Taiwan, Thailand, Korea, Burma, Vietnam etc and the fact that MDZS and TGCF had media already known in the English language audience.",

Do you like taking both apart piece by piece, agonizing over (un)successful character development, pointing out plotholes, delighting in perfectly executed tropes, and rueing horrible cliches? If so, you need to pick this book up.The story features a protagonist who is a die-hard fan/hater of his favourite novel who balks about what the author should fix so passionately that when he dies, The System answers his call: if he can do it so well, then it's HIS turn to fix the writing! And he'll do just that, all while being forced into the role of the villain who is destined to die a horrible death...unless he successfully changes the story.This novel is the best parts of tearing your favourite fandom to pieces as a participant, and then realizing just how hard it can be to fix your story as a writer. Shen Qingqiu stumbles along trying to change the grim fate of the character he's become, but it quickly becomes obvious that changing the story so drastically is having some major domino effects, chief among them being the massive shift in how main character of the story feels about him. Believe me, don't skip out on this one.",

                "reviewText": "For starters, the actual book itself is gorgeous! The cover is smooth and nicely made and it feels great to hold! The interior is well designed too, with each regular page having a decorative header, and the glossary pages having a small graphic on the outer edge to differentiate which part of the book contains the story and which contains the glossary - Really helpful for readers who find themselves flipping to the back for reference while reading! (Publishers of all fantasy novels, please take note\u2026.) There are also several wonderful black and white illustrations by the cover artist throughout he book to showcase the book\u2019s major events, and each one perfectly captures the tone and character expressions of each moment!The story itself is wonderful as well, being a comedic take on tropes of the genre, but is never fully above poking fun at itself. The main character is pretty oblivious despite being what *should* be a powerful all-knowing omniscient reader, and it\u2019s a delight to both read his snarky and relatable inner monologue and the book\u2019s author perfectly setting him up to suffer the consequences of his own faults. For people experiencing this series for the first time, I can guarantee this book will be even more satisfying on second read once all four volumes have been released (and ESPECIALLY if the extra chapters detailing certain side characters are eventually included).As for the translation, I\u2019m really pleased to see how cohesive it\u2019s been made! I think it was a great choice fitting genre terms in the glossary instead of including them all as foot notes, and leaving the most important moment-to-moment references to keep readers immersed. A lot of care has been put in to balance making it readable for newcomers with making sure everything is kept in the spirit and intent of the original work. I was pretty worried it would be a tough translation considering how much our main character likes to think in memes and euphemisms exclusive to Chinese culture that may be lost on a reader who isn\u2019t as familiar with those. But I\u2019m really pleased to see they did a great job conveying the intent of those parts without going too deep into explanation OR over localizing it. I\u2019d even be comfortable recommending this book to an absolute newcomer to the genre, which is something I didn\u2019t expect when given the choice between this and the author\u2019s other two works.As a final note, I personally love that Seven Seas put in the time to source artists and translators from the fan community for this series of novel releases. It\u2019s obvious that the people who worked on this love these stories and have an incredible amount of respect and admiration for the material.Overall, great release! Looking forward to volume 2!",

                "reviewText": "Essa era a \u00fanica obra da MXTX que n\u00e3o tinha lido ainda e me impressionou muito. Em v\u00e1rios aspectos \u00e9 poss\u00edvel perceber o prot\u00f3tipo do Wei Wuxian de MDZS, mas em geral \u00e9 uma obra totalmente independente e \u00e9 facilmente a mais engra\u00e7ada! Shen Qingqiu \u00e9 um dos melhores personagens que a autora j\u00e1 escreveu e mesmo recheada de com\u00e9dia, a novel n\u00e3o perde o drama t\u00e3o caracter\u00edstico. MDZS segue sendo minha novel preferida, mas esta ocupa o segundo lugar, vindo HOB (TGCF) em terceiro.Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 edi\u00e7\u00e3o, ao contr\u00e1rio da edi\u00e7\u00e3o de MDZS, eu amei as ilustra\u00e7\u00f5es de capa e internas. Aspecto negativo que tenho percebido \u00e9 que a jun\u00e7\u00e3o da ilustra\u00e7\u00e3o colorida interna tem se descolado em todas as obras (vide foto). Em geral, uma novel sensacional, com personagens incr\u00edveis, excelente humor, \u00f3timo drama e bom romance, com uma edi\u00e7\u00e3o que fez jus a ela. Recomendo!",

                "reviewText": "Pre-ordered this and will be buying up the entire series. Scum Villain Self Saving System, or SVSSS, is MXTX's first series she worked on. Let me preface this by saying this is a comedy with some angst sprinkled throughout (90% comedy/satire and maybe 10% pain). We have our unreliable narrator, Shen Yuan, who leaves a negative review in present day after sitting through a rollercoaster of an unsatisfying conclusion to a trashy web novel he has been a loyal follower of. He chokes on his meal and reaches his untimely demise. The next thing he knows when he wakes up is that he has transmigrated into that trashy web novel! Not only that, but he has become the scum villain, Shen Qingqiu, who is fated to die at the hands of his disciple/protagonist, Luo Binghe! It is now his job to ensure his own survival while filling in the plot holes.I wasn't expecting the story to be that refined compared to MXTX's later works, but SVSSS has got to be my favourite. My guy and gal friends all started watching the animation on Youtube first, which follows the novel quite closely. The main character is HILARIOUS. He's your typical millennial who is just trying to survive ancient cultivation world, and will often comment about his current predicaments and the lack of IQ of some villains, and make jabs at common stereotypes (think: your typical harem anime tropes, etc... you know what I mean. The same recycled content in some genres). Follow his adventures as he tries to navigate through the world, train his disciples, and be a good teacher. It's honestly all fun and games until you realize on your second read that everything is actually kind of tragic? There are a lot of misunderstandings. One minute you're laughing at how funny the entire situation is, and the next you're left with your mouth hanging and heart ripped in half. Oops.Compared to the other two series, SVSSS is a shorter read, and maybe more light hearted. It's a great way to ease into the cultivation genre of novels. Honestly, the MC is so relatable, which must have been why it was such a great read.Again, even though the book is classified as a BL, it really isn't the main focus of the plot. My guy and gal friends have watched the series/read the book, and enjoyed it. The romance is mainly in the extra chapters if that is not your cup of tea. If you're still on the fence, try watching the 3D animation on Youtube. You won't regret it :) Just prepare your wallet again because it's a 10/10 book and I am very excited that it will be having an official English translation for us to support MXTX. Fingers crossed that we will be blessed with season 2 of the animation soon as the future volumes release!",

The book came super fast, and was packed nicely, so the book was not damaged in any way.The book is beautiful, the drawings are perfect. But the thing that i love the most is at the end of the book. There is a summary of what you need to know like descriptions of locations, explained meaning of important words, symbolism of things, there are drawings of the most important characters with names and descriptions of how to pronounce them.Just totally perfect book.",
