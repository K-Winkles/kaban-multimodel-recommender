L.C does well ensuring the characters don't get too close for too long.I also loved the relationship with parents in this book, with so many books killing off parents/guardian figures, its refreshing to see one showcase a loving parent-to-child relationship.Certainly a start for found family, I was a bit overwhelmed with the amount of new characters at the start but L.C fleshes them out and I found myself really enjoying the female friendships! (We need more Female friendships in Ya Fantasy and Dystopian!!!) So I look forward to seeing how these new friendships develop in the next book.I enjoyed the ending! It leads nicely to the next book! A little bit of mystery is present in the whole book (in the best way) and I can't wait to see what L.C has planned!",

                "reviewText": "Oh boy, this would have been an all time favorite for teenager me. 30 year old me still enjoyed it immensely too.I loved that there were no content issues, everything was kept clean.The plot and worldbuilding had me hooked!Talia is a wonderful main character. She\u2019s not the best at everything, but she has a big heart. Raph is your typical brooding and handsome young male character, but still likeable.The romance is clean. I\u2019m not sure I would call it slow burn. I think I would just call it normal paced romance. The two love interests have pretty quick attraction to each other, but it\u2019s definitely not an instant-a-love, which is always a huge plus.The writing is really good. I always knew what was going on and I could picture everything. At times the language was definitely YA. (For example \u201cSomething is going on between you and Mr. Hot and Steely.\u201d) BUT this is YA so I\u2019m not holding that against it. I know younger me would be in love with Mr. Hot and Steely \ud83d\ude02Content: clean, no swearing, slight violence but nothing overly descriptive.",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoyed The Calling! It was a fast-paced read that keeps you interested the entire time, which I really enjoyed (being a fast-paced writer myself). People described it as a blend between Divergent and Robin Hood, and I couldn't agree more with that comparison. I thought the blend of fantasy and dystopian worked really well, though I would've liked even more of the dystopian elements as much of this book was more fantasy-esque.For the most part, I thought Talia was a great protagonist, but I had some trouble connecting with her. I didn't really understand her motivations until about halfway through the story. Jules was my favorite character, and I eagerly awaited her POV chapters as I read Talia's. The relationship between the Strangers and Talia was perfectly executed, and each of them had such distinct personalities and voices that I never had to guess who was talking (GIVE ME YOUR SECRETS L.C. PYE!).The plot was super intriguing and thrilling, though I will say I did guess the plot twist at the end. Still, that didn't make it any less enthralling.Some of the writing style wasn't my favorite, and I did notice that the book strangely seemed to switch from present tense, to past tense, and back without warning, often on the same page. It didn't pull me out of the story, but it was a bit jarring. That's just my opinion, and I can see many people enjoying that style.This book is advertised as part romance, which was one of the reasons why I was skeptical when I picked this up, as I don't usually enjoy romance. I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually a very small part of the story and didn't take precedence over the main plot. I'm sure the romance will become heavier throughout the series, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it's handled.Overall, The Calling was a fast-paced, exciting read that kept me on the edge of my seat! I read it in about 2.5 days, which doesn't usually happen with me. I'm really excited to see where Pye takes the story in the next three books!",

                "reviewText": "This book is beautifully written, with such mystery and suspense. Love that unknown enemy aspect to the storyline.The characters have depth and you can\u2019t help but be intrigued by each of them.The FMC is also so intriguing with her loving parents but with the rest of the village folk disliking her.I found all the rules mesmerising- the breadcrumbs of why they were implemented is fascinating.Overall a fantastic read, very unlike my usual steamy read as this has zero steamy scenes - even with that I thought it was great and I\u2019m looking forward to reading the next book",
