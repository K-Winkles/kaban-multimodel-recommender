I don't know about you, but this makes me smile because this just means humans worked on it. Besides, even imperfect books have beautiful stories inside. And this is a lovely story, and setting up a world I look forward to exploring more in depth.",

Gives a whole new dimension and depth to the story. Also, like the fact that there\u2019s ghost stories, but not like gory\u2026 Just cool, creepy and significant. I\u2019m so excited I have both of these books and if there\u2019s a third one coming out soon. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "So I watched the first season of the anime before I knew this existed. This LN is about half of what was shown in the anime. So I know what\u2019s to come at least a little bit. But I really enjoyed the anime and I enjoyed this book even more. After reading the apothecary diaries and seeing how well the anime did, I must say I\u2019m surprised by how much details were cut out of the anime for this series. There seems to be smaller scenes that happen in this LN that were not included in the anime that don\u2019t necessarily change too much but they were details that I think explained some things so you won\u2019t be confused. But again I really like this. I had to give four stars though because there are a lot of grammar issues. It\u2019s not so bad I can\u2019t read the book but it\u2019s enough where I had to stop and slowly reread certain sentences. I wouldn\u2019t let that stop you from reading because again this is a really good LN, but just a heads up \ud83d\ude01",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars An interesting supernatural mystery at Imperial Court of another world",
                "reviewText": "The Raven Consort is a mysterious figure in the palace life, a 16-year old girl, a consort without night-time duties who can help talk with the dead, deal with ghosts and supposedly even curse others. When the young emperor visits her for the first time to deal with a ghost haunting a jade earring he supposedly found, the two get more involved through that first case, and later because she raised the emperor's interest.The Raven of the Inner Palace is an intriguing low-fantasy story, a romance with several mysteries of a supernatural nature (mostly ghosts) set at the Inner Palace of a Chinese-like Imperial court. The characters are interesting, as are the stories, mostly tied to various tragedies of palace life (including one violent change of a dynasty), but with hints of an overarching story in regards to the nature of the Raven Consort. The pacing is slow though, especially of the romance, and there is always the question about the number of ghosts and why if they are so easy to create, people are not more respectful to those with the talent to deal with them although admittedly most don't pose much of a threat to the living.Still, I found it a very enjoyable read, a book I took up due to the recently aired anime, a good adaptation but the LN does provide some more details and I am looking forward to the translation of future volumes.",
