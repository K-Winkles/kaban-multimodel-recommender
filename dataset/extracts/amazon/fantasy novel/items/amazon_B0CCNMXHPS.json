                "reviewText": "This book takes plot armor to the extreme and is a perfect example of Stan Lee's statement of: \"The person that would win in a fight is the person the script writer wants to win.\" Normally, I don't care much about power level arguments or whatever as long it is in the realm of plausibility, but the author stretched his own system to an extreme in this book to make it unbelievable. To make things more ridiculous is that he had everyone sit on the side (Loki familia) with flimsy logic who could have alleviated the problem. Instead, he showed biased favoritism towards other characters he wanted to fight by having the Freya supporters conveniently \"forget\" to ban outside familia members from joining the war game later. Sure, maybe having Loki familia members fight would have taken some focus away from Hestia familia, but at least the book would have been believable and enjoyable.I hope this pattern doesn't continue in future books as I have really enjoyed the series up to this volume, but this book sure did kill my excitement and anticipation for future books. Overall, the writing and execution of this volume left much to desire.",
