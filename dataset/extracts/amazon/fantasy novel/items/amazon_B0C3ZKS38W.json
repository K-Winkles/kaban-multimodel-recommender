That\u2019s not to say there are no interactions between Kiyoka and Miyo however. There are and they are very important and a longtime coming I think. I think the development between them and how it it\u2019s happening is cute too. Now the ending was a bit predictable for me. I still enjoyed it but you can kind of see it coming. And SPOILER ALERT: it ends on a cliffhanger which makes me sad. But fortunately the next book is set to release soon \ud83d\udc9c",

The writing is great but the heavy emphasis on military strategy to fight the antagonist Usui was the bulk of the volume.This volume was a bridge to the next phase of Kiyoka and Miyo's relationship. I get that this is a light novel, but Vol 5 and 6 should have been combined into one volume. I don't want to give away the story, but after reading it, I wanted more (maybe that was the author's intent). Now we have to wait until Feb 20, 2024, to find out what happens next. My advice, wait until February 18 to read Volume 5, so you can go straight to Volume 6 to get a fuller story. You won't miss anything by waiting.",

However, besides, this volume being too short. Miyo was growing as a character in the other volumes, finding her voice. Then you took it completely away. WHY? Just because a woman is demure as well as the damsel in distress doesn't make her an idiot. In this book, she was way too slow, unsure, confused, and weak. You can't write that she is powerful in her dream site realm if you make her weak in her dream site realm. Why even give her a power if she is not smart enough to use it? I believe in my heart it will get better, but this was upsetting. I was definitely expecting more, not just from Miyo; but all characters in power.",

I mean how many ways can you keep writing the same lessen over and over again: Miyo keeps her feelings shut and learns at the end that she needs to express them.Just seems that the author is purposely keeping her stupid, and Miyo is incapable of growing. Maybe I\u2019m just bothered that she is not turning out to be a strong female character.Will I buy the next volume? Yeah cuz it left me hanging, and Kiyoka!",
