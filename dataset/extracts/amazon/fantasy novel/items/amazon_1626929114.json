If anything I think there was a greater attention to detail paid to the characters of our main group. Some unorthodox pairings were put forward here and they had an interesting back and forth between them. The only issue I really have with this entry, and it's really more of a personal preference than anything at this point, is that the book didn't seem finished. The climax at the end of the story felt more like it was a half way point in a larger volume.",

I like the fact that this volume give more insigth on the relationship between the other partie member, i also love the evolution of haruhiro but in fact all the partie member are devloped and for one of them it's realy unspected, the monster also get a lot of time and personality. Overall the serie continue to get better as volumes go on.",
