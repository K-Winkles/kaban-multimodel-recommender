They do keep most of the messes contained and manageable. They're not foolproof, though. If something bubbles over on the stove, the liquid will definitely get underneath these covers and make a mess. They're also not entirely flame resistant. I have different sized burners on my stove, and sometimes the one specifically trimmed for each burner doesn't make it back to the right spot. After 2 years of use, most of them have burned edges and have become too brittle to use anymore. (And I've been concerned about what fumes that burning silicone must have put into the air in my house.) All in all, they work pretty well even though they're not a perfect solution. I'm considering buying another set.",

                "reviewText": "I use these burner covers on my gas stove. I have one of those \u201cfancy\u201d stoves with the big iron grates and power burner gas jets. These burners put out a big flame. I got tired to trying to scrub the burned on food, so I gave these a try. Well, they are just perfect. The heat and fire from the jet doesn\u2019t seem to affect these. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re made of, but it sure is capable of handing a lot of heat. When I clean the stove I shake these off and wash the crumbs and stuff down the garbage disposal. Then I fill the sink with warm water and a squirt of dish soap. Soak them for a few mins and rinse and you\u2019re good to go again. On thing to note is that some food will burn to these mat covers. You\u2019ll end up with a cover that has some burned on food\u2014like charcoal. However, I\u2019d much rather have it burn on the cover than on the stove and have to scrub it off. I definitely recommend these.",
