You cannot adjust the size, but merely add a second one. My stove has an electrical outlet on the top which doesn't allow two side by side, so we are stuck with one in the center only.The magnet in the base is strong enough to grip the top of the panel, and the tray sides are high enough to catch spills. Though the cutout in the front is narrow so if you don't have much overhead space, lifting salt or pepper mills, or taller dishes out makes a bit of a snag/spill issue unless you can tip them on their side or have the taller things in the center where the cutout is.Not a fantastic product or listing description.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have limited counter space in my kitchen, so I thought these would provide a great solution for storing my often-used spices, etc.There are two flexible silicone trays, which doesn't exactly provide an 'adjustable length,' but it does give you the option of either 15 inches of storage on top of your stove, or add the second one for another 15 inches. Both pieces fit on my stove.With magnets on the base, these are designed to 'fit perfectly on both flat and slightly curved stove top.' The idea is that even on a curve stove top, the magnets will keep it in place. This information is what I like to call wrong. Maybe if they were 'powerful magnets' as mentioned in the product information it would work that way, but I'd judge these aren't much stronger than the magnets you have on your fridge. It does not take much at all to slip them off my metal stove. I certainly wouldn't put anything heavy or spillable up there because it would only be a matter of time before they fell off and made a mess.Overall I'm disappointed with these. I don't feel the magnets in the base are strong enough to secure them to the top of my stove, and I would not trust them with much on them. I would not order them again.",
