This replacement Range Knob Dial was specifically designed to look and function the same as the original Burner Knob Dial on Samsung Range Oven. While this is NOT a genuine Samsung part, it is a direct replacement and it will appear, fit and work like the factory part.",
            "Upgraded:Strong rings to reinforce around the middle part of the knobs - kinda like a tight sleeve around them to ensure they can take heavy duty and won't be cracked easily. No tool required - Easily install the part YOURSELF and quickly get your range oven burner back to work within few minutes.",

Fit for Samsung Range Oven NX58H5600SS, NX58H5650WS, NX58J7750SS, NX58M6850SS, NX58K7850SS Gas Range - If your stove is black, you will need DG64-00473B instead and this knob won't match your color."

                "reviewText": "I love my Samsung range, except for one thing: the knobs. They tend to break in a particular way after fairly short use. The reason they break is because the inside sleeve at the back of of the knob, the part that slips over the burner control rod on the range, is made of plastic. Every time you turn the knob, all the torque is transferred to that small diameter plastic sleeve, and being plastic, it tends to break it. My original knobs were failing after just a couple months of use. Samsung wants $50 to replace ONE knob. With 6 knobs on the front of the range, replacing them is a close to the cost of a brand new range. So the first thing I love about these replacement knobs is the price. Under $40 for five of them. The second thing I love about these replacement knobs is that they fit more snugly than the originals. They fit so snugly that at first, I thought they were the wrong size. I had a little trouble getting them to seat on the rod. But they aren't the wrong size. It just takes a little bit more force to get them to slide onto the range control rods. But once on, they don't 'wobble' like the original knobs do. This should also reduce breakage. Because the original knobs are so loose, when you turn those knobs, the internal sleeve is already rotating when it engages with the control rod, magnifying the bad effects of the torque. Even if I didn't describe that well enough to be understandable, the bottom line is that the new knobs fit better and seem more durable than the original (and they look exactly the same). And even if they end up failing at the same rate as the original knobs, the replacement cost is reasonable.",

                "reviewText": "Three of the five original knobs on my stove broke from wear over the years. I\u2019m pleasantly surprised at how nice this new set looks compared to the original knobs. The only difference I see is that the new knobs are shiny chrome finish and not a matte finish like the original ones. Not a problem though. They fit tightly & turn with ease. I think they look great! Highly recommend!",

After reading the description and looking at the customer reviews of the LONGADS replacement oven knobs over other brands, I went ahead and ordered them.... fast Forward --> One day later: I just got done replacing those rater cheap Samsung knobs that came on my Samsung Gas over with the LONGADS stainless steel replacements; ALL I can say is WOW!! These are really nice looking metal knobs, they replace the stock Samsung plastic knobs that look bad and won't stay attached after years of use with quality Stainless Steel knobs. There is no doubt in my mind that these LONGADS reinforced metal knobs will last me a lifetime! They look absolutely perfect! The metal reinforcing on the shaft connector is complete and runs the entire length of the stem making them quite durable as described by Longads. These are currently available for purchase on Amazon's website with lightning fast shipping and delivery. Installation took a couple of minutes, very easy and straightforward. I am not paid by, nor affiliated with LONGADS. These are my honest opinions and review of this product on my own oven.",
