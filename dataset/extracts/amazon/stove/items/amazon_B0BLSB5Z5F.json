                "reviewText": "*** THIS KNOB IS EXACTLY THE KNOB FOR MY OVEN! ***18 months after purchasing the BRAND NEW Samsung oven Samsung NX58H5600SS/AA, suddenly one of the original knobs literally fell apart when I tried to turn it on. Checked Samsung and other distributors and was shocked by the super high prices of these replacement knobs. Then checked Amazon and found one that gave my model # of the oven as a perfect fit so I ordered it and was so excited when it arrived because it *looked* exactly like the original. Tried to put it on the stem but NOPE - it didn't even fit on the stem. Packed it up and returned it. (I always, always read the reviews from previous purchasers but for some reason apparently did not because when I read them after I received the one that didn't fit, so many buyers had the exact problem I had.)Then I checked Amazon for more sellers of that same knob and I found the one offered from AMI PARTS and I ordered. Opened it up today and it: Looks exactly like the original knobs. Feels exactly like the original knobs, maybe even sturdier! The finish is exactly like the original knobs. And the best thing is IT FITS EXACTLY! This is the Holy Grail!See my attached pictures. There are some weird shadows but these are the best pics I could get. The first pic is of the cracked and destroyed knob. Second pic is of another knob that I took off a different burner on the stove. The third pic is of the AMI PARTS knob which is the exact same except it doesn't have the letters on the back side. PERFECT! EXCELLENT! Would definitely buy again and you should, too!",

That is the *only* reason the range isn\u2019t listed: the blue lights. I bought the set and tried them. They work just fine and fit the mechanism. Although the knobs are slightly smaller than original set and I may not see the blue lights as much as before, I can still see the blue enough to know if the gas is in on position.Pictures attached to show what I\u2019m referring to.All in all happy with this purchase. Will update if needed.",

                "reviewText": "I made the absolutely stupid decision to buy a Samsung cooktop (never again with Samsung appliances!) Samsung wanted something like $180 to replace each of their defective knobs that use plastic stems that will easily break over and over. So, I bought these. They don\u2019t say they work with the Samsung NA36N7755TS cooktop, but they will. You just have to remove the iron D-shaped ring that comes with these knobs (with pliers) and replace them with the ones that are in the garbage Samsung plastic knob stems. Yeah, the notch on the knobs won\u2019t light up and the original knobs are more narrow (and the writing on the new knobs doesn\u2019t correspond to the writing on the cooktop for high/low/etc.), but these replacements feel much more solid and better constructed. I have a feeling that the writing on these knobs will rub off over time anyway. Also, it costs 1/4 of the cost of one garbage Samsung knob to get five of these.I\u2019ll update this review if these knobs end up breaking so if there\u2019s no update you can assume they are still going strong.You can see in the photos the original knobs with the broken stems and how these knobs look on my cooktop",
