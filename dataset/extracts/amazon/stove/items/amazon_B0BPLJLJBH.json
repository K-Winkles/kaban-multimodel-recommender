Scratches or staims relatively easily. Probably benfit with a electric plate glass cleaner fluid. A little heavy if you have a small kitchen, picking up and putting away after meals is tedius, best remains on the counter.Its generally a good product for the price and I cant comment on longivity but so far it does what it was purchased for, and everything that came in the package along with quality matches what was advertisedThe plug in was convinient. I woulf recommend anyone using both burners be warmed this does take more than 15AMP with a 120v, so breakers with 15Amp sockets Should NOT be used.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m blown away by this little cooktop. I especially like that this can be used as a portable cooktop that I can put on the countertop or the outdoor picnic table!This is NOT an induction cooktop but a regular conduction electric heat system that is compatible with all types of cookware. That means it gets hot and the difference between old exposed electric heating elements is this has a ceramic glass cover over the heating elements.There are two heating zones, one is a small 6.5-inch diameter and the other is a large 7.75-inch diameter. The large burner has 9 different temperature settings while the small burner only has low and high.This thing works great. The materials are good quality. It is durable and easy to use. The attached 120v plug makes it easy to plug in anywhere. The touch controls are simple and intuitive. I didn\u2019t need to read the instructions to understand how to use it. It heats up quickly and evenly.I really like that the heating elements are sealed so no food, crumbs or anything else gets into the burner. It makes it super easy to clean with a simple wipe down.It comes with hardware for installing it flush into a countertop or if you decide like me to keep it portable there are 4 rubber feet that are screwed to the bottom. The sides are the bare metal housing, I might try to make a decorative frame for it but there appears to be some cooling holes that must be considered in my design.I love that I can take it out to the bar-b-q outdoor events or use as warmer for party server. It is also great having an extra cooktop during the holidays when there is so much to cook giving me two extra burners. I keep in the pantry when I don\u2019t need it. It\u2019s perfect for using on the table for fondue or group hot pot. I used it at a party for keeping chocolate melted for strawberry dipping!Finally, there is a website with a support email address and warranty registration for the 3-year warranty. This gives me a bit of confidence that the product is well designed and reliable. I\u2019m glad I got it.",

                "reviewText": "I recently ordered this electric cooktop \u2013 the model with touch controls. It\u2019s plug-and-play, super simple with no additional wires involved, and you're ready to cook.The cooktop operates at 110v, and the ceramic surface ensures even heat distribution. The touch control panel is modern and sleek with good sensitivity and simple button distribution. The controls include a child safety lock, which can be a valuable feature for households with young children. The timer and pause functions are also convenient if you need to walk away briefly.However, it's important to note that this cooktop isn't exactly two cooktops; rather, it has one powerful 1400W burner and one smaller 600W burner designed for keeping food warm or slow reheating. The larger burner works exceptionally well for cooking, heating up quickly, and handling larger portions efficiently. I tested the smaller burner, and as expected (as per the product description), it takes about 6 minutes to fry an egg. It's ideal for its designated purpose but not meant for extensive cooking. The safety feature that turns off the burners when you remove the pot or pan is really nice, don\u2019t have to worry about accidentally leaving anything on.Cleaning is amazingly simple due to the black tempered glass covering the entire surface without any gaps. I just wipe it down, and the cooktop is clean and ready for the next use. The build quality is sturdy, and I believe this cooktop should last for a long time of extended use. I recommend this product.",
