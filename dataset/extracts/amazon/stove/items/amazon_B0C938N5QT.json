                "reviewText": "We camp and HAD been using one small old fashioned electric coil burner. It got the job done, but it took forever to boil water for tea/coffee/instant oatmeal or to make water warm enough to wash dishes.NO LONGER! This induction burner is big, stable, and heats twice as much water in less than half the time. My husband absolutely loves it! Yes, at high heat levels, it makes a little noise, but it\u2019s not bad at all. Except for boiling water, we never use it above level 5. Pans are much more stable, too, because it\u2019s a much larger base.We bought a used teakettle that was magnetic, and our travel skillet already was. We\u2019re not ready to buy a full induction cookware set, but may buy a 3 qt lidded deep skillet. We will still use the old coil burner if we need to heat two dishes separately, but we definitely prefer the induction burner.I\u2019d be on the lookout for sale prices on Black Friday and Cyber Monday (word to the wise). Btw, the seller is very responsive to messages and has very good English proficiency.",

                "reviewText": "I had been eying induction burners for some time now. My stovetop burners are finicky and I finally got fed up with having pots boil over or not otherwise stay at the temperature I wanted. This burner is actually somewhat larger than I expected, but that\u2019s a good thing because it easily accommodates my Lodge Dutch Oven and 12\u201d cast iron frying pan. The performance is outstanding. At the high setting a covered pot of water starts to boil in less than a minute. After that I can turn it down to one of the lower settings and it will stay at the exact same temperature indefinitely. It\u2019s also very easy to clean. Great product!",
