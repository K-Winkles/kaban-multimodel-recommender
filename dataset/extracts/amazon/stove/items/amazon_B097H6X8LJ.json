It's pretty silent and heat quickly. The top is easy to clean which is a plus.Cons: currently I couldn't find a con after several uses. Probably the price is not inexpensive, but i want to choose a reliable cooktop. It's light-weight but feels high quality materials. I will definitely update if there would be any problem.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to get this induction unit to replace my old hot plate. This has been absolutely wonderful. Yes there is a learning curve to its proper use, but not a problem . What I love is that it only gets hot where a pan is sitting. I can use a large frying pan for stir fry or two pans for steaming vegetables. Clean up is a breeze with its particular surface compared to the hot plate I had before which looked horrible after a few months and was impossible to actually look clean. This unit also cools down almost immediately after turning off and looks very nice sitting on my counter.",

Out of the blue decided it wasn't going to work anymore. I contacted the seller asking about the warranty. I got an email wanting a video so they could see what it was doing. I know they're supposed to be power on the wall. Check that it's there. I tried turning it off unplugging I looking for a reset button. Everything - it is dead. Nothing happens when you plug it in and push the button.After a little time the seller made it right.They sent me a replacement. It works well.I have decided that I will not use this as the primary hot plate waiting for the cook-top (LP gas) to be installed. That date keeps getting pushed back.I will then be moving this out to the RV as a good secondary in place of the gas stove if our LP is running low.I did notice THAT I PAID $96.00 initially and now its down to $55?Doesn't seem fair to me.It is a good hotplate. Better be steel tho.Induction does work on this.I would buy it again at the new price.",

                "reviewText": "I bought it for a way to cook some top ramen in hotels as my family and I drove from Massachusetts to Iowa to move back home permanently. Sadly the moving to Iowa box was one of the first boxes the movers grabbed to be hauled in the gigantic moving truck. No boba/ramen/coffee to be had.I did tear into this once we arrived in our brand new house. My husband chose a quaint home that has our dining room, kitchen, and a half bath on the main floor. The beautiful galley style kitchen with brand new everything is, charming.The main floor is dedicated to our 24x20ft dining room, this is where we spend most of our time anyway. However a 6x4 kitchen I was not expecting. So this burner has a permanent home on the end of my breakfast bar. Instant boil was why I bought it, but extra cooking area is what it's main use has become.Needless to say, not one meal will be forgotten to be cooked, because I did not have enough space to cook in.PROS:-I really like that you can lock it to the controls so nobody accidentally turns it on while cleaning it or by setting things on it.-It is very sensitive and responsive.-That very safety feature is a great idea that made this machine go from wanted, to nearly daily used.CONS:-If you do not set the control lock feature any person or animal can turn it on.",

It\u2019s great for the hot pot season that\u2019s coming up. The sleek and compact design of this cooktop not only saves counter space but also looks incredibly stylish. It\u2019s perfect for small kitchens. Powerful performance 1800W of power, this cooktop heats up incredibly fast and cooks food nicely. The 3-hour timer feature is a lifesaver for me. I can set it and forget it, and it turns off automatically when the cooking time is up, especially when I want to steam my fish. This is also perfect for camping. Five stars well deserved!",

Ich habe die Platte nun schon einige Zeit im Gebrauch und bin nach wie vor begeistert. 1 L Wasser kocht unterhalb kurzen Minuten. und auch im allgemeinen Kochbetrieb heizt die Platte schnell auf.Der Wechsel zwischen den Leistungsstufen und/oder den voreingestellten Programmen geht ohne Problem. Die Leistungsstufen reichen aus, um z\u00fcgig zu kochen, braten, d\u00fcnsten oder schmoren.Ein weiterer, angenehmer Nebeneffekt ist, dass beim \u00c4ndern der Leistung/Programme/Zeit kein zus\u00e4tzlicher Piepton nervt.Die Zeiteinstellung ist minutengenau und auch w\u00e4hrend des Kochvorgangs einstell- und \u00e4nderbar.Der L\u00fcfter schaltet sich zeitverz\u00f6gert ein und hat eine ertr\u00e4gliche Lautst\u00e4rke, zumal die Koch/Bratger\u00e4usche ihr \u00dcbriges dazu tun.Die Reinigung geht schnell und einfach, durch die ebene Glaskeramikfl\u00e4che bleibt nichts in Ecken oder \u00dcberg\u00e4ngen h\u00e4ngen, nur mit einem feuchten Sp\u00fclilappen abreiben und trockenwischen.Die Sensortasten reagieren schnell und sicher auf Ber\u00fchrungen.Alles in Allem bin ich mit der Platte sehr zufrieden und kann sie uneingeschr\u00e4nkt weiterempfehlen.",
