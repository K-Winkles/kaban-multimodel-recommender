                "reviewText": "This is a life saver!Very modern design, light weight, and fits in small spaces.Works better than an old stove which takes a long time to heat up and boil water.Although these burners work too well! You have to be careful with the temperature because it does heat up fast and it\u2019s super hot.I actually had to turn it off and unplug it because it kept heating my food too much even at low heat.But that\u2019s not a problem, I love my burners. They\u2019re a great and useful purchase.",

                "reviewText": "The cast iron plate to me is better than the spiral heating element types. At my job, we occasionally get new 1 gallon cans of epoxy where the epoxy is almost as thick as clay. We use the burner to heat the gallon cans to liquefy the epoxy before mixing with hardener. The cans have a tendency to jiggle on top of the spiral heating element type burner. The cast iron plate is solid and does not have any movement which will be better for 1 gallon cans of epoxy.I tested the burner on heat setting number 2 to liquefy a jar of solidified coconut oil. It only took about 15 minutes on low heat to do so.This burner was not purchased to cook with so I cannot vouch for its cooking abilities. Some people claim it takes a while to heat up. I will soon find out when it is used to heat cans of solidified epoxy. I am not worried about slow heat and slow cool down cycles. The burner stays stationary in an area away from any potential combustible objects and is left to cool down after heating a can of epoxy that needs to be liquefied.",
