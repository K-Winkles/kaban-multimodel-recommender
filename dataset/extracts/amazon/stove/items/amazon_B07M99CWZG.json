                "reviewText": "I bought this after reading several reviews. I recently moved into an older home from the 1920s, and the range that was in here just had to go. I am still renovating and needing something simple to help do some light cooking. After giving it a go, I am so impressed!!Positives * Love the look, I would love a black stainless but the stainless steel is a nice look overall. * Boiled water VERY fast for me, I read some reviews where it was iffy for them but I had no issues at all. Just a medium-sized regular pot for me and it did the job very quickly. * Also was able to scramble some eggs quite quickly as well. Over all, tends to heat thoroughly for me.Negatives * I wish it had a different temperature knob on it, so you knew from \"Low - High\" etc. You can pretty much figure it out with ease though. * Only other negative I had was, just because I sometimes run about doing other things, I wish it had an alarm that could be set to remind that its turned on. Yes, it has a light so you can just utilize that, but I tend to set myself alarms on my phone anytime I utilize kitchen items just to make sure I remember to turn them off. Would just be a nice quality of life addition, nothing really horrible by not having one.Outside of that, I am so excited and happy to get to use this little burner. If you're looking for something at a good price point, and need a burner for anything, I would totally recommend grabbing this!",

                "reviewText": "This unit is nicely built and even has an on/off to control both burners as well as the temperature controls. I'd rate it higher if the burners heated to the edges. Both burners only heat the center 4 or 5 inches and if your using a larger skillet the center gets hot and the outside edges stay cooler. If you use a larger size cast iron skillet the center expands with the heat and the bottom become convex raising the edges away from the burner causing even more uneven heating and destabilizing the pan . Used with small pots and pans this would be a good choice.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Techwood 1800W Portable Electric Stove with high hopes for a convenient and efficient cooking solution, but unfortunately, my experience has been less than satisfactory.One of the major drawbacks is the inconsistent heating performance. Despite the 1800W power rating, the burners seem to struggle to reach and maintain the desired temperature. Cooking times are prolonged, and achieving even heat distribution across cookware has proven to be a challenge. This inconsistency has significantly impacted the quality of my cooking, leading to frustration and disappointment.The build quality of the electric stove also leaves much to be desired. The materials used feel flimsy, and the overall construction lacks durability. The adjustable temperature control, while present, seems imprecise and unreliable, making it difficult to achieve the desired cooking results. The stay-cool handles, advertised as a feature, don't effectively dissipate heat, posing a safety concern during use.Another issue is the limited size of the 7.5\" cooktop. While it may be suitable for some basic cooking tasks, it proves impractical for larger pots and pans, restricting the versatility of the appliance. This limitation was not clearly communicated in the product description, leading to unexpected challenges in preparing meals of various sizes.Furthermore, the compatibility claim with all cookwares falls short of reality. The heating elements seem to struggle with certain materials, resulting in uneven cooking and potential damage to cookware. This lack of compatibility undermines the versatility promised by the product.In terms of portability, the Techwood Electric Stove falls short of expectations. While it's marketed as a portable solution for RVs, homes, and camps, the bulkiness and awkward design make it less convenient to transport than anticipated. The lack of a secure and compact storage solution adds to the overall disappointment.In conclusion, the Techwood 1800W Portable Electric Stove has not lived up to my expectations, and I cannot recommend it based on my experience. The issues with inconsistent heating, subpar build quality, limited cooktop size, and questionable compatibility with cookware make it a less-than-ideal choice for those seeking a reliable and versatile portable cooking solution.",

We still use it but it shakes the nerves a little as the pan is not quite as stable as it should be and doesn't heat as evenly as it should (pretty evenly but still not as evenly as it should) due to the \"foot\" not being in good, solid contact all the way around.Still, we are able to make homemade tortillas, omelettes, bacon, crepes, etc. quite successfully even though the plate is a touch (couple mm?) small.I am not sorry we bought it. Even a year later I watch for one I think might have a bigger plate and stay as hot but have not found one that compares.",
