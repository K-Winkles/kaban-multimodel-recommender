I also like the bottom buckles that you can clip around the legs to secure it. The storage bag is a nice touch. I assume it will hold up well this winter. The rain we had pilled/beaded on top, so it seems very waterproof. Time will tell, but so far I\u2019m extremely pleased.",

It can hold standing water on top and never leak a drop. That was the biggest key for me. Aside from that, it's thick and durable. It looks good and goes on and off easily. It was an excellent value for the money, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.",
