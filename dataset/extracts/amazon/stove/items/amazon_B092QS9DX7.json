The flame retention head is precisely engineered to deliver the best bang for the fuel that you choose to fire it with. My personal choice is LPG. But if you prefer butane , this burner will perform just fine on that also. Great for go-bags, provides heat and eats. Get two, their small but mighty.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly, this product is really not much of a backpacking stove. It has no wind screen, and the burner looks like a burner you'd have on a gas range in your house. It is not crazy heavy, but you can definitely find lighter stoves out there. So if you are backpacking and just need something as light as possible to boil water, keep looking.Nor is it a great car camping stove. When you don't really care how much your stove weighs, you want something a bit more solid and stable. When this thing is perched on top of a big green propane cylinder it is not exactly the most stable thing in the world. It works, but there are better choices.What this thing is good at is being an emergency backup stove for power outages and such. It is small, it tucks away neatly in its little carrying case, and will run either the backpacker style iso-butane or the big green propane bottles with the included adapter.And when you unfold it, it will heat almost any normal pot or pan since it basically looks just like the burner on a regular gas range in your house. You will just have to be careful with it, but it works fine. You can turn it down and simmer, cook basically anything with it. It works just like the burner in your house once you light it with a lighter.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Better Burner",
                "reviewText": "After 15 years of use my MSR Pocket Rocket no longer functions. Where it failed is the threaded part at the bottom that connects to the butane cannister. That part is soft aluminum and over time it just wore out. Toward the end it required more and more pressure to tighten and the last time I tightened it, it stripped out. There appears to be no way to fix it.This current stove took 2 days to deliver and it appears to be new, not previously owned and returned.Whereas the part that failed on my Pocket Rocket failed was made of aluminum, on this new stove it appears to be brass. Maybe that will translate into better wear. We'll see.The stove comes in a small, blue canvas pouch, 4\" x 4-3/8\" x 1-1/4\" thick.Nice, but, you have to disassemble the stove each time to get it to fit in the pouch and I do not want to stress the threads unnecessarily, so will not be using the pouch.The stove comes in 2 parts and I don't know why that is necessary. There is the large burner part, and a stem that connects to the butane can. On the Pocket Rocket those 2 parts are just one part. I will keep the 2 parts connected.Also, an adapter comes with this stove for connecting it to 1 lb \"Coleman Type\" propane bottles. The adapter threads onto the stove stem, then the bottle threads onto the adapter. All threaded connections see nice and solid, secure.I threaded this stove to a 230gr butane cannister after I tightened the on/off wire lever in the off position. Other than a very small \"pffft\" there was no other noise or leak. I twisted the on/off lever half a turn and could hear the gas coming out and I struck the Bic lighter next to it. It fired up instantly. I twisted the lever 1 complete turn and the fire was roaring. A nice, big, blue ring of fire. No sputtering, no plugged holes, perfect.Note: There is one place on the fire ring where there are no holes and I don't know why that is. Looks like there is a gap of about 6 holes in 3 rows that do not exist. Maybe if it gets to bothering me too much I'll use a small drill bit and carefully drill in the missing holes. Regardless, the missing holes do not seem to effect the performance.After letting the stove cool down for half an hour I connected the propane bottle and adapter to it and fired it up. Again, the performance was flawless.This new stove has a much larger diameter flame pattern than that of the MSR Pocket Rocket. I mainly cook in an MSR 800ml titanium kettle and the Rocket always made a black mark in a specific place on the bottom. Maybe a thin spot in the metal? Or a hotspot with the stove? Dunno. So it will be interesting to find out if the larger flame pattern of the new stove will do the same thing, or not, or create a different type of blackening. shrugThe things that are diff between my old stove and the new one are:1. The new stove is bigger than the old.2. The new stove seems to have a more robust material where it connects to the butane tank.Time will tell.So far I am pleased with this stove and I hope it will last at least as long as my old MSR Pocket Rocket, which doesn't seem to be available any more.",

Very large diameter-so disperses the flame very well around your pan/pot. Boiled large container of water very fast (~5min). I\u2019m buying a second one",
