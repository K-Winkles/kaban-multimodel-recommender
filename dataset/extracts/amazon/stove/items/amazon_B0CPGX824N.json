They are super simple to fold, unfold and use. The fact that you can get a 2 pack for the asking price is also impressive. These are made from decent quality materials that are on par with the price point. You do get what you pay for, meaning you won't get many years of use from this item, but you also won't be heartbroken when you need to replace it. I do wish they were slightly taller, but that's the sacrifice made for keeping the unit so compact. I rate this at 5 stars for value, quality, and ease of use. It's worth having on hand in those \"just in case\" scenarios.",

They collapse easily for storage so they don't take up a lot of space when not in use.They are to be used with Sterno fuel, but are designed in such a way that you could use alternative fuel sources in a pinch if needed. They are sturdy when set up and easily support your average size sauce pan. For the pans I have, I wouldn't go above a 3 quart size and expect it to be able to efficiently heat the pan.",

It does a good job of blocking the wind, and the silver reflective material magnifies the heat. Be careful though, as the metal gets very hot. Fun to take this along for hikes to prepare coffee or tea in a natural setting. Tranquil and relaxing.",

The flames are mostly protected from the wind, but a really strong wind could still knock it out.4. The silver metal walls also reflect the radiated heat, so heats your hands up pretty well too.5. Pretty basic unit but works well.THE BAD:1. The sterno can weighs more than the stove, but no way around that.2. The walls do get pretty hot during use, so don\u2019t touch them and you will have to wait for them to cool down before packing it up.",

I saw these and lots of hiking memories came back and I had to order them....these are perfect for what I needed. They're sturdy, fold up for easy storage and don't take up much room at all in the tote. Hubby loves them, brings back fond memories, so he's picking up some cans of Sterno to throw in and have at the ready. Thanks to these our car emergency kit is almost complete. Never know when a night of car camping will present itself, lol. \ud83d\ude09",

                "reviewText": "Love these little sterno stoves. They fold up SO small. I haven't actually tested them because I have to wait for my green canned heat fuel to arrive, but I have used Sterno products in the past and I'm familiar with their high quality nature. Dropping one of these into my my emergency \"bug-out\" bag in the house and another in the emergency supplies in the car. Love that they are so light and small, yet made of sturdy metal able to block the wind and serve as a great stove in emergency situations (like when the power goes out!).",
