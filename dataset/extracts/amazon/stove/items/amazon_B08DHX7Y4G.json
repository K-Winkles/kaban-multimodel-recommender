                "reviewText": "I bought this thing a couple years ago and we love it! Super lightweight for 2+ person camping trips (We have a family of five) and butane canisters are cheap, easy to find, and in my opinion, last longer and burn cleaner than propane. This burner is foolproof, no wacky contraptions or confusing instructions. Just lift the lid, pop the new canister in, twist, and put the lid back on. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because sometimes when its really windy, the flames disperse unevenly. I like to put something behind it to block the wind. Other than that I have no complaints about this thing, I was looking for a cute, easy to clean, easy to store burner and this was it! I like the carrying case too, and it doesn't need very long to cool off to store it away. Great purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this little stove and used it pretty regularly. At first I loved it because of its compact size and the aesthetics. However, by the time I hit the 2-year mark with it, it started having major problems: As others have observed, it does not last long at all, and the price point is not worth the short lifespan, especially if you are having to constantly replace it.Also worth noting: When it started malfunctioning, it was leaking gas, and when I tried to use the stovetop, flames would shoot out the sides in front of the unit instead of up into the little stovetop. This ended up singeing everything that was around the stove. At first I thought it was a fluke but then it started happening regularly, and I realized the stove was malfunctioning.I contacted the seller and they were not helpful at all; they (rather condescendingly) told me to read the manual, and then refused to do anything about it because it was past the return window. They refused to stand behind their product, and instead are basically selling something disposable that you will have to re-purchase every year or so. It\u2019s a cute stove definitely, but it\u2019s just not worth it if you\u2019re going to actually use it.PS- I also noticed that it had started rusting a bunch by the end of the first year. Kept it indoors so that\u2019s weird. Almost didn\u2019t notice it but when you look closely, you can see the inside rusted.",
