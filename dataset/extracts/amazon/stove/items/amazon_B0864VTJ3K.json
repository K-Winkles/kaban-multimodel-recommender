The US1269E measures 33 inches long, 18.5 inches wide, and 23 inches high with a weight of about 130 pounds, so it may not be portable enough to bring camping with you or carry around the house, it can do just right when sitting in the middle of your cabin. The stove is capable of reaching a maximum of 54,000 BTUs and heating up 900 square feet of space around it for a reliable heat source you can cook your hot soup on during a cold winter\u2019s night.

I accepted and assembled the stove and installed some stove pipe. I lit a small fire in the stove and smoke billowed out under the front of the stove - there are two big square holes under there with no way to close them. Smoke also came out of the front of the door where there is a vent. I had the chimney damper open, and no smoke was coming out of the chimney, all of it was exiting into my house. There is a weird \"baffle\" in the top of the stove and the instructions say not to alter it in any way, but it seems to be sealing the firebox from the chimney, thus the smoke exiting the front and bottom of the stove. What a colossal waste of time and effort for this POS.",

                "reviewText": "I installed one in a small cabin, and it took a bit to get it dialed in. I would recommend not drilling or modifying anything until you take time to learn how it works best for your situation. I was surprised that it does have a seal around the door that is replaceable, but the cast hinges are a bit off, so it never seals perfect but good enough. The door latch is not real robust so got to be careful with that.My biggest complaint is that it has a front vent on the door that is wide open and not adjustable. If the manufacturer reads this, please design a door with an adjustable vent. There is a fix that works well for this which is to put some steel wool into the vent to adjust the flow of air into the firebox. By doing this I can load the box 1/2- 3/4 full and get about 4 hours of burn time with my damper closed.I had a similar stove to this, that had an adjustable vent in the door and worked really well.Gave it 4 stars because no door vent.",

The door is hefty for it's size and seals very well (but US Stove says to change out the door sealing rope every 1-2 years).>>> Be sure to use a US Stove DR6 Barometric Draft Regulator (about $70 unless to can find it on sale ... see Amazon (currently $36 but it is Prime Day today).This beast is HEAVY ... about 130+ pounds. The shipping box leaves much to be desired so receiving the stove in perfect physical condition might be questionable (quite a few Customer reviews have mentioned this) but Amazon will back you by giving you options if it arrived with any shipping damage or factory defect(s).",
