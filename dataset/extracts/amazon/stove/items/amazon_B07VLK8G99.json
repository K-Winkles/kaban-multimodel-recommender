Plus, that gas bill wasn't too nice either. SO, I started looking at my options. Found this on a good deal and had to get it.Overall, this is a really nice cook top. Being a glass top, it takes a little more time to heat up but, it gets there. Heats evenly and everything I've made on it so far has come out really well!!Cleans up easily and stores perfectly in my cabinet.",

                "reviewText": "Great value for the money. I love the gorgeous appearance of this infrared cooktop with a white marble finish on its stainless steel top, & 2 black durable glass burners which show even, bright red patterns as they heat. It looks so nice, if it wasn't designed as a portable model, I'd install it as a permanent drop-in cooktop in my cabinet. This is my 1st experience with infrared cooking, & I was amazed by how quickly & evenly it heats. I've found mine to be quiet, making no unusual noise. I have no trouble boiling water, or cooking things so they turn out exactly the same as on my gas stove. & Another bonus is it's SO much easier to clean. I've been happily using this model x2 months for all my stove top cooking, & it's doing quite well, but I'll update if anything changes. Highly recommended!",

This burner is well made. It warms up very nicely.The only problem I had is the design. It is not trendy enough for me. Seemed too big and old-fashioned.The price mark was reasonable, being that everything is so costly.I purchased it to use it for every day, to boil water and warm up and cook up small meals.I did return it and ordered an upgraded model. I am sure I will like it because it does fit the decor of my kitchen. The quality of the unit is fine and fits the description. Other than being too large for the space where I use it, it is a good buy.",

                "reviewText": "Earlier, I had purchased a portable dual side-by-side burner style for my basement kitchen which does not have a stove (note the original unit was a recognizable quality brand name). We wanted two full functioning burners, however we found that unit had only one side which had enough heat to cook food and bring water to a boil (however it was a bit underpowered and slow to cook and boil water compared to our main level stove), the other burner was just a warmer only and could not cook food or boil water at all which was not advertised accurately so I had Amazon pick it up. Before buying anything else, I finally did some real research rather than simply depending on brand name and review quantity and rating alone and found these units which are very powerful (high wattage rating) and cook food quickly and can bring water to a boil quick and easy. I also found that having 2 completely separate burners is a major advantage. It allows you to use any size pan by just physically moving them further apart (which was a huge problem with the dual side by side design). A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing. Glad I learned what I did from the original purchase so I was armed with everything I needed to know to buy the perfect burner setup. These units work very well (similar in perform to our stove), appear to be well made and are perfect for us :). Keep in mind, these are very new to us and have only been used a few times at the time of this writing, so I can not speak to the durability or longevity of these units yet but everything looks good so far.",

It's compact for easy storage and very easy to clean. I was almost put of by comments regard \"slow to heat\" but I decided to try it for myself and I'm glad I did. The hot plate heated to over 500\u00b0 in less than a minute - PERFECT. No muss, no fuss, just plug it in, set the dial and cook. I do not prefer cooking on my range because of the mess it can create and I'm a bit of a neat freak so this hot plate works perfectly on my kitchen counter for easy cleanup. I highly recommend checking this one out - the price is right.",

Even turned up all the way, the smaller burner takes 5 minutes to melt a heaping tablespoon of butter on top of a small saucepan of peas! And yes, my pan is really flat and makes good surface contact. 2) The smallest droplets of moisture left on the heating plates, such as from a boiling splash, result in a spot of bright orange rust on the burner plate the next day. Yes, it scrubs away with a steel wool scrubber, but that's unacceptable to me. For a $60 hotplate, bought new? Nope! Buy it at a garage sale for $5...yep!",
