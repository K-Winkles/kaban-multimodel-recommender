                "reviewText": "Motherboard to my range is being repaired. This has come to the rescue while I wait. It cooks perfectly. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it does take a while to boil water, but that\u2019s ok - I have another Ovente item that boils water in a snap, the kettle. I use cast iron on this hot plate and it heats beautifully, evenly. It is easy to clean, but if you\u2019re like me and hate streaks and smudges, know that no matter what you clean it with, it will be streaky. I am sure once that manufacturer\u2019s film wears off the streaks will cease. I will use this in the future when the power is out and I am running a generator. For now, I am in total amazement of how well this works!",

                "reviewText": "This replaced a very minimal 12 year old unit, one of those \"just the heating coil\" cheapos. I had no idea how much I had shortchanged myself 12 years ago, this is so much better.The glass top really makes a difference in heat distribution, the old unit had a hotspot in the middle and cooled gradually to the edges. Not so with this, seems even from edge to edge.The old unit's control know would not turn off the element. Not a defect, other buyers complained of it (so I knew it before buying). This one turns completely off fully counter-clockwise and that is so handy. Of course you shouldn't depend on this, but it's convenient when dinner's hot & ready, I don't have to immediately unplug it. And the markings are wonderful, easy to see. Old unit just had a \"pointer\" with no reference marks at all, really all so arbitrary I hardly used it for temperature control at all.Finally, those \"coil only\" units have a design flaw built in, that is if you expect them to last. I suspect they are all like the one I had, although I'm not going to purchase any more just to find out. The coil has little integral legs that allow it to set in place. But the coil is free to flop around. The 2 wires that supply power to the coil are directly attached to it, underneath in the base unit. They take a beating from the movement and break off. They are difficult to deal with as they can't be soldered, they are connected with 1/4\" fast-ons. The only way I got 12 years out of that unit was by repairing those wires more times than I can count, usually right in the middle of preparing food, not the most pleasant experience when your belly is rumbling. This unit may have the same system, but the glass top keeps the coil from flopping about and your pans sit on the glass, avoiding the constant moving of the coil, so this *should* work better. Time will tell.Every time I cook now I am thrilled with this unit. I'll never go back to \"el cheapo\" and neither should you.",

                "reviewText": "The Ovente countertop burner with ceramic glass is an excellent addition to any kitchen, surely. It heats up very fast, and very hot provides an easy-to-use device that does not take much to place & start using and eventually gives excellent cooking results as soon as you get used to it. However, that's only in the first couple of months of using the product.I bought it because I wanted an alternative to cook things that didn't use gas. This way I could prepare foods such as omelets, fried & boiled eggs, sausages, etc. that didn't take much time and still receive a great result. But after two months of getting a more-than-decent experience, the burner started to have a few problems.Firstly, the burner started to lose the indication numbers for heat level. This started happening in the first month, without the numbers it started to become a little difficult to know what was the heat level, until I got accustomed and made the indications myself with a permanent colored marker. It was a bit problematic, but nothing out of the ordinary.Secondly, the burner turned on and off while heating. It was a sort of heat protection (I think) that keeps the device from overheating. The problem with this is that the first three levels of heating didn't work when the device sensed overheating. Really I couldn't say what that was, but it happened every time I used the burner for more than 5 minutes. It eventually got annoying to hear the burner go on and off, and a little frustrating I could use the first three levels. However, of course, I could live with this.Thirdly, the ceramic glass on the large side fell off after two months of use. I bought this burner in July and started using it in August. By October, the ceramic glass on the large side of the burner fell off. I don't know how it was attached to the device, but the glass separated from the metal and was sliding off from its place every time I had to place/move the device. I tried gluing it to the device again with temperature-resistant glue, but it fell off two weeks later once again. So it left it like that. Until yesterday.Yesterday while cleaning the device, I turned it 90\u00ba by mistake, and the ceramic glass fell to the floor. Here, you can imagine what happened later. A bunch of broken glass I had to swipe off, and an almost useless large burner on the device that I don't know how to fix.So, I could say this device works well when it comes to performance. It may become a little problematic after a month or two, but nothing that would really damage your cooking. However, it is not as dependable or resistant as you would hope.I used it almost every day, so it is easy to say that I might have overused it. However, of course, that's not an excuse for a product that should have lasted more, or at least not give that many problems in such a short period.I give it three stars because it performs well, but it loses two because it could be a little more durable & reliable. Overall, however, it is a great option for the price, as long as you are going to use the device every now and then, and still being aware that after a few hundred uses it could start presenting a few issues.",

If it's on full heat it is straight up and down but turned off its at the 1 o'clock position. this aggravates me for no real reason at all. Anyhow...several reviews said it too so long to boil water. First thing I did was take a 2 qt. pot put in a little more than a qt. of water and hard boil 4 eggs. from the min I took it out of the box til I removed the eggs was about 20 min. that's no slower than a stove. This morning about a half an hour ago I put a 6 qt. pot of beans on about half full and its bubbling away. The body does get quite hot so don't get too close even to the knob. The unit is light weight and easy clean. I'm happy.",
