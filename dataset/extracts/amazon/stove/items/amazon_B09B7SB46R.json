                "reviewText": "Update: I\u2019ve been using this oven for a couple months now for roasting, baking, broiling, air frying, and reheating. It is an outstanding oven that performs flawlessly every time. The oven heats evenly, so baked goods cook uniformly. Over the holidays I baked cookies, and since then enchiladas, cornbread, casseroles, sheet pan meals, hot wings, salmon, quesadillas, broiled sandwiches, etc. I love the amount of cooking space available and it doesn\u2019t take up too much counter space. This is the best toaster oven I\u2019ve owned. Absolutely love it!We purchased this oven to replace our Ninja Foodie flip-up air fryer/toaster oven which we\u2019ve had for just over a year. We are full-time RVers and seldom bother to light and use the gas oven in our RV, so it\u2019s very important to me that I have a good countertop oven. With limited space, I love that it doubles as an air fryer, too. We have a separate toaster because I\u2019ve never been satisfied with the way a toaster oven toasts (sounds silly, but give me a pop-up toaster any day).I never liked our old oven because it\u2019s not tall enough inside to cook in anything but a tray. It was also not heating properly and I was very disappointed with the results. It don\u2019t heat properly and was too small to bake a cake or roast a whole chicken.I spent a lot of time researching other combination air fryer/ovens until I came upon this oven. I will update later, but I was very impressed with the cooking performance of my first meal - a sheet pan meal with Parmesan-crusted chicken breasts and broccoli. I baked it for 14 minutes at 425\u00b0, turning the broccoli half way through. The chicken was perfectly cooked - juicy inside with a golden brown, crusty topping. The broccoli had the right amount of char without being over or undercooked. I was amazed how much better it roasted than the old oven and I like the way the baking tray just slips into the slots on the side. This meal wasn\u2019t very messy, so there wasn\u2019t much splatter and there were no drips to clean.Today I\u2019m baking cookies and tomorrow I\u2019m air frying wings, so I will update after I\u2019ve used it a few more times. We buy meal kits from Green Chef, and many of the recipes require baking. Since there are just two of us, this will definitely do the trick.This is a very preliminary review, but the positives include: roomy interior cooking space, easy to bake with a 9\u201d square pan, pie pan, or 12\u201d cookie sheet. Evenly heats and the temperature was consistent with a thermometer. It didn\u2019t overheat the room and we keep a 4-6\u201d space from walls. The interior light is bright. I like the double doors, but be sure there is enough space to fully open them so they don\u2019t close on your hand - especially if it\u2019s hot! There are many simple settings and it\u2019s easy to adjust the temperature and time. I\u2019m looking forward to experimenting more! The only negative so far is that it can\u2019t accommodate the 12\u201d pizza pan that worked with the old oven. This isn\u2019t a problem because I\u2019ve found frozen pizza is best when cooked on the wire rack instead of in a pan. We use our outdoor pizza oven for homemade pizza anyway.We will definitely stay on top of cleaning it after each use, wiping off splatters & drips that can smoke up the kitchen. It\u2019s not likely we will use the rotisserie because I\u2019m sure it would be very messy, but it\u2019s going to be great for baking, roasting & air frying.More later after I\u2019ve used this for a few months, but if you\u2019ve been considering getting this while it\u2019s on sale - go for it!",

Works great for fries, pizza rolls, frozen egg rolls, so much better than a microwave and not much more time.I\u2019ve also broiled steak and roasts which with the help of my IQ thermometer cook in 60% of the time and turn out very good and even crust up a bit.Easy to set up and pretty easy to use, I\u2019ve yet to read the included recipe book. I bought it Black Friday and have used it more than my oven.It is a bit bulky but I purposely bought one big enough to do rotisserie, which I haven tried yet but it\u2019s coming soon.The purchase was inspired by the air fryer we got the previous Christmas. We enjoyed it but the basket was too small for a dinner for 4. This one can cook a real meal.",

It\u2019s got a nice large cooking area, the air fryer, and rotisserie that all work great! He was able to put a cooking stone in it and is able to cook a 12in pizza! It\u2019s like a real oven but more practical for his kitchenette area. Great buy!",

Also ours had a steam leak that started within about two weeks of use so we are getting a replacement. Nice unit and looks good on the counter top, cooks very nicely, but could use some updates. We found that cleaning was a little bit of a challenge but doable. Things stick to the basket and you need to use a scrubber on the accessories. Amazon customer service was very helpful in getting the replacement.",

I've roasted quite a few chickens I have air fried chicken, I've rotisseried chicken drums or thighs on the rotisserie which is great, you can get you some nice crispy skin that way. Number one tip is make sure to take the drip pan out and line it with aluminum foil so it makes for easy cleaning and saves you a lot of time. Oh and for those that want to know... I don't think I'll ever cook a steak any differently other than a barbecue ever again. Their Grill platter is fantastic and the preheat mode before cooking makes sure that it is nice and hot so when you drop your steak on there it is immediately sizzling loudly, it gets the job done real nice.",

I am so glad that I upgraded to this version of the Emeril oven. If you are looking for a multi-purpose oven, this is the one to get.",

All we wanted was a stove we purchased it in good faith we repurchased this oven and are glad we did. We love it we now see that there is a double size. Two sided I wish we had waited.

Be careful not to burn yourself. I think it will last longer as a result though. And it works great.My model came with the grilling plate and I love it.The drip tray is removable and catches crumbs well, but to help keep the inside clean for many types of cooking, I also recommend getting third party stainless steel 12.5x9.5 inch baking pans that come with raised baking grills. It will let the air fryer circulate while catching more significant amounts of sauce and greasy drips.",
