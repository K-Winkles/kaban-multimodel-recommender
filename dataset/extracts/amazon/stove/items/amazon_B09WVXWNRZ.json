But after reading many reviews, and applying some basic physics, I decided to go for it. I am really glad I did.It absolutely does capture and redirect the heat noticeably. Of course there are a few caveats. First, if there is a significant wind it is less effective. But my first use was on a 45 degree night with a slight breeze, maybe 3-4 mph. Sitting my usual distance away about 3 feet the difference in radiated heat on me was very substantial and I didn\u2019t have the usual hot and cold zones. I sat at various clock positions around and had the same experience on all positions.If I had to rate the heating of the stove with and without I\u2019d give it a 5 without and a solid 8 with.As you can see from other reviews, this is a must have with the really cold nights. I definitely would buy again!",

I like the minimal smoke from my solo, use the pellet adapter and stay warm with the now redirected heat... Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "As with any of the Solo products I've purchased, it's a quality item that's well engineered, effective and expensive. Since it works as advertised and I made the decision to buy it, then it seems that I see the value, but it still seems expensive for a metal disk.I believe once I've had this longer I'll discover a better method for this, but at this point it's a little dangerous. The issue I have is with how the deflector is \"installed\" when you are using it. When it's cold, it's easy enough to put it on the ledge of the firepit. When you want to add wood or pellets, it's a different story. My opinion is that the smartest way to add wood is to remove the deflector and add the wood or pellets, then replace the deflector. Assuming you use gloves or a pot holder removing it is simple. Replacing it is more of a challenge, particularly if you are using pellets and some of them end up on the ledge. You have to line up the three legs on the ledge with a relatively small margin of error while a fire roars in your face. If you misalign it, or manage to land one of the legs on a couple pellets, the deflector falls off. That's definitely not a good thing. It would be great if there was a heat resistant handle off the side or similar.Most things have drawbacks somewhere, and overall I'm very happy with the performance so I'm very pleased with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I would get this again, but it isn't life changing. The legs should fold. That is the biggest complaint. You pay high dollar for this thing and it takes up a lot of space when the stove isn't in use. If the legs folded, you could tuck it behind something in the garage or behind the grill. The legs come off, but they are covered in soot (Which is to be expected), so having to wrestle them off is a dirty job. The heat output is ok and definitely improves things. It is still not a massive change. It is over priced, but it is a nice add on.",

We popped this deflector on the solo and everyone was amazed! All the heat is directed right back at everyone sitting or standing around it. I cannot recommend the deflector enough! The only thing they need to change is they should include a storage bag, it gets sooty after use. I made my own bag so we easily transport when camping.",
