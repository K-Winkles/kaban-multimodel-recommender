I have a few extra cans of fuel too as this stove comes only with three cans. Better to feel silly and be prepared then stuck in a blackout in the middle of winter without heat.

I won't use it for cooking just a heater.I am using cheap canned heat from local store so I don't know if the included cans are hotter or not. I did notice that if I pulled the wick out a little more the fire will get hotter but burns fuel faster. I will order the insta canned heat to see if theirs makes a difference.",

It comes with three tins of \"fancy heat\" but for testing I just used two of the ones I got from the dollar store. And we only tested the heater.It did not take long for the fan to start turning, and we did notice a difference, the room was a little warmer. But as I said, it was dollar store canned heat and only two of them, and one was already half used up.So the test was positive, and next I'm going to try my stove top coffee pot on it to see how long that takes. We had a 24 hour power outage a few years ago when we lived in BC, and it was a nightmare to wake up and realize we weren't getting any coffee!!! And I suppose while I'm waiting for the coffee pot, I'll try cooking an egg.I would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially since you are able to use it indoors. It's not heavy, but is sturdy. This is one item I have no regrets about purchasing!",

The fumes were bad, had to leave a window cracked, which let 100% of the heat it produces right out the window. Takes 45 mins to boil water. The stainless grill seems to be of a high quality, the rest is just stamped and riveted and coated sheet metal. Definitely not worth the $260 I paid. Thankfully it's being refunded.",
