Remove the collar with an Allen wrench and swap out the connectors for the correct ones, remove the Lopi element from the old igniter housing with an Allen wrench, slide in the new element and lock down the Allen screw, re install the igniter into the stove, works like brand new and cost only 15 bucks!",
