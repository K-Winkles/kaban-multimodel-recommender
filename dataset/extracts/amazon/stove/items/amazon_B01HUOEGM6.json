It was so hot, I could not use it at full heat! Why I love this, is now I plan to use it with my wok too! I definitely can it stir fry on my electric stove either.I love that I can use it safely in my house. I also love the carrying case, so I can take it camping with me. I love the ease of use. I love how handy it is. The size it perfect. I just love it! By the way\u2026.. my fudge was perfect!",

                "reviewText": "Update:After returning the product I was contacted by the company via email through Amazon. They offered to send a replacement and did so promptly. The replacement is in pristine condition and functions as described. My only comment is that it is lightweight and that may be the reason the original was damaged as for the rust inside I have no clue other than a leak in the packaging may have allowed moisture into the package.In any case, the stove is adequate for my intended use with consideration that like other products proper care, handling,cleaning and storage should provide years of use.In addition, the company was very responsive and courteous in dealing with this issue. In short, if I ever need another I would likely purchase this product again.The photos appeared to be a quality product, however reality not so much. It was cheaply constructed, damage that had been attempted to repair and not durable. The wind guard was damaged and badly repaired leaving copious rust on the product and inside the burner area. The materials were lightweight and not suitable for long term use. The price was high as were my expectations, sadly very dissatisfied and product returned for refund.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A Terrific Ultra-Portable Powerful Burner",
                "reviewText": "I purchased this 15,000 BTU model to use for wok cooking as well as for high-heat searing the surface of sous vide steaks. It functions extremely well for both of those tasks, quickly heating pans to the \"screaming hot\" temperatures required for certain types of specialized cooking. It's also quite easy to use. From insertion of the butane cartridge, to lighting the burner, to ease of clean up, each task is a breeze.The burner is also quite lightweight and very portable. That's a positive benefit most of the time, however it does mean you shouldn't make vigorous shaking/tossing movements with a wok or you'll risk moving the burner, too. But using it with care is a small price to pay for the high output flame generated from this stove top.The only downside I've encountered is the \"hard carrying case\" that's included with the burner. \"Hard\" is not a word I would use to describe the flimsy plastic sheath-like thing that surrounded the stove when I opened the package. If the plastic used was any thinner, it would be translucent, and the tiny plastic hinges are laughable. Honestly, the case is an absolute joke ... a bad joke. A very bad joke.One more thing: Before I purchased this Chef Master 90019 15,000 BTU portable stove I asked other purchasers if non-Chef Master butane refills could be used. (I live in an area where butane canisters can't be shipped to individuals, and Chef Master brand items are not available in my state.) Although I didn't receive a satisfactory answer to my question at that time, I can provide the definitive answer now. Yes, other brands of 8 ounce butane canisters absolutely do work with this stove. I've used 8 ounce notched Sterno brand butane canisters as well as Coleman branded ones, and both brands are compatible with this stove.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The lighter on the unit works great (but, after reading reviews, didn't think it would). The first time I tested I turned knob all the way to the left (beyond the 'flash' ignite mark) for several seconds and nothing but the smell of butane. I turned off, took out the canister, waited until gas had dissipated, and then tried again. This time I turned it directly to the 'flash' ignite mark for half a second and then a further click beyond that and it ignited immediately. I've tried it the same way over a dozen times now and it's always successful. The flame is great, lots of heat control between low and high settings (unlike with my Coleman propane grill) and the connection between canister and unit is perfect (also, unlike the screw-on propane tanks to my Coleman grill). Feels very safe and controlled. Would highly recommend. This is for our next Nor'easter without power.",
