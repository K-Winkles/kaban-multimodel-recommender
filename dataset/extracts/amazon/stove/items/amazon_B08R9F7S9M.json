For my GE range, these pans are 'Type B' as specified by the range manufacturer. I did pose a question on what type these were (A or B), but received no answers, so since I was anxious to replace the cheap ones I had, I just went ahead and ordered them. Thankfully, I wasn't disappointed, am very happy with the product. Definitely will order again when needed.",

They fit perfectly in my GE electric stove. I have washed and scrubbed them, put them in the dishwasher, and they have held up well. The paint has worn away a bit on the burner that I use the most. It does look a bit rusty/ worn. By the time I move out, they will definitely need to be replaced. But it\u2019s worth the money if you want something that hold up and will probably lasts longer than other types of aluminum or foil kinds.In the video and pictures, they are clean. They were just scrubbed and washed earlier in the day. So that is how they look after a couple months of use. It all depends how frequently you cook and clean them as well. I cook every day and clean them weekly so they have definitely worn down a bit",

Always had an issue with putting the burner back on over the drip pan. These fit the burner perfectly! One of the larger drip pans was a bit small so I had to push aggressively to get it flat. It is still a little tilted so I put it in the back were it\u2019s not used all the time, just every now and again. Overall all, happy with the product; all but one drip pan was perfect and makes my stove look 100% better! Now to get some new burners. The finish is as described and with a black stove, the black pan works well!",

These, so far, clean up and look like new after such 'accidents'. My only concern is that the large ones are a VERY tight fit - don't know if it's because of the enamel coating? The small ones go right in; the large ones I have to 'pop' them in and then they're hard to get out to clean (thankfully it's not as often as with the silver ones). Overall, though, I really love these enameled ones!",
