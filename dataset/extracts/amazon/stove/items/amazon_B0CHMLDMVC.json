Our fireplace fan made of high-quality anodized aluminum has better thermal conductivity and will not deform or rust even under high temperature for a long time, a perfect companion to every home that has fireplace.",
            "\ud83d\udd25\u30104 Effective Blades\u3011According to professional testing, 4 blades are the most suitable combination. The wind power of 3 blades fan is not enough. More than 4 blades are too heavy for the motor, causing the blades rotate slowly and easily damage the motor. The base is firm, won't wobble or tip over, even in the highest wind speeds.",
            "\ud83d\udd25\u3010Energy Saving\u3011Thermal drive, no electricity required, saving cost. The fireplace simply pushes heat to the ceiling or around the stove. The stove fan for buddy heater makes full use of the heat generated by the stove to generate electricity and run, distributes the heat to all areas of the room, reduces wood consumption by 28% !",
            "\ud83d\udd25\u3010Safety Design\u3011The bottom of the wood burning stove fan is equipped with a bi-metal safety device. When the surface temperature exceeds 345\u00b0C, the front of the heat fan is lifted and STOP WORKING to protect the TEG and motor. The pellet stove fan has a handle, which can avoid burns and convenient when moving.",
            "\ud83d\udd25\u3010Super Quiet \u3011The only moving parts of the wood stove fan heat powered are 4 blades, the noise is less than 32dB, so quiet that you won't notice when it's running, but you will feel the heat! Say goodbye to horrible noise while enjoying the hot air.",
            "\ud83d\udd25\u3010Ideal Gift\u3011Ecofan size: 18.2 x 18 x 9.5cm. No installation required, suitable for wood, gas and pellet stoves with a surface temperature between 80\u00b0C-345\u00b0C. (NOTE: Not suitable for stove with insulation and marble on top). Also, it comes with a exquisite package, a great Christmas Gift, New Year Gift for friends and family.",
            "\ud83d\udd25\u3010Working Guide\u3011\u2460 The fan for wood stove does not work when lower than 80\u00b0C or higher than 345\u00b0C. When 80-200\u00b0C and 320-345\u00b0C, the wind speed is slower. The ideal temperature is 200-320\u00b0C, the wind speed and heat dissipation will be perfect. \u2461When the cocoon fan is running, please do not touch. \u2462If the highest temperature of your stove top is lower than 100\u00b0C/212\u00b0F, it is not suitable, the fan will not work effectively."

I was worried becaused I'd looked at reviews, and one person had video of it not working. I am convinced that it was not used properly. It has to be able to catch the rising hot air to make the fan move. She had it dangling in front of the fire. I have videoed mine, and I slow it down in the video to show that it's blades are moving fast, but on camera it looks like it's not spinning much.The room is normally so chilly (even with the fire) that I need a blanket on my lap. This fan quietly pushes the heat toward you with no noise, no breeze. It doesn't cool the heated air by blowing too hard. It's almost radiant, but not......if that makes sense? Anyway: excellent product for an affordable price. \ud83d\udc4c",

This is the only one that did not activate at all. The blades are thin and easily bent, then they get stuck. Even when you make sure by hand that's it's able to spin freely, no amount of heat activates it. It's going in the trash! The one I ended up keeping is the LAMA 7 BLADE-that one spun and was so quiet, I didn't even know it was spinning. I can't say anything about the heat transfer but anything is better rhan nothing and if you get too strong a fan you feel a breeze and get smoke.",
