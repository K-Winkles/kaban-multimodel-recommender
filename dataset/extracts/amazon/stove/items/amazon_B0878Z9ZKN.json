Comes with extra orifices, but neither the manual nor the markings make it clear which orifices are for natural gas and which are for propane. It's obvious that the instruction manual was written by a person whose first language is not English.",

If the unit came with a regulator combo and a updated instruction manual it would probably be a decent product.Please don't count this as a bad review this product has potential it just gas appliances has to be taken seriously as they can be dangerous if not installed correctly.",
