                "reviewText": "I LOVE this thing!! I got a new induction/convection range and I did not want to scratch the glass so I figured I would be proactive and take care of it. I also use my cooktop to rest things on when not in use.... This is like a huge mousepad for your cooktop. It comes with hangers and 2 loops, but I will never use them. I just cooked and folded it over to the left side so the front right burner was ready. It comes with 2 black silicone gap covers which I was thinking about getting anyway so one less order with this kit!About this being 'heat resistant,\" I can't test that as induction cooktops don't get hot like that at all. Warm, yes; but not hot. I was looking at silicone cooktop covers too, but for this size they usually come folded and the creases never come out. While this was folded, the bump is small (I wouldn't call it a crease) and it does not look to be permanent. I can certainly live with it if I had to, but it does look like it will flatten.Best feature is that is does not have some goofy name painted on it to make my kitchen look cheap.",
