                "reviewText": "I bought this set of drip bowls for a GE cooktop (Model JP328). While the bowls are stainless steel, the gauge of metal is much thinner than with the factory original bowls. The rims of the 8 inch bowls were bent when I opened the plastic bag the set was shipped in, but the rims were easy to bend back.The rims of both the 8 inch and 6 inch bowls have lower profiles than the factory original bowls. This means the surface units (burners) sit lower than before. That's OK for the 6 inch bowls on my cooktop, but it was a problem for one of the 8 inch bowls where, at first, the surface unit did not sit level in the bowl. I eventually fixed the problem by bending the rim of the bowl so the rim was even all the way around.Since they're stainless steel, I'll keep the bowls. However, had I known how thin the metal was, I would have bought something else.",
