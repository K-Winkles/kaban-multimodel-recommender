                "reviewText": "I am really happy with this stovetop cover for flat top stoves. I\u2019d looked at noodles but being short on storage area couldn\u2019t figure out where I\u2019d put it when using stovetop. This mat IS the ANSWER! It covers full stove top and I love that it keeps crumbs out of the little edge. It is easy to just roll up and stick in the pantry or hang it by the little loops when using the stovetop. No need to remit when you use just the oven because it is heat resistant for a pretty good bit. I love being able to take things from the oven and set on the top without worrying about leaving a mark on a wooden noodle. Easy to clean too, just wipe off with wet dishrag. You can use a soft brush if spills get on it. At about 1/3 the cost of the wooden noodle covers that are so popular this is most sensible buy. I hope you like yours as much as I like mine!",

                "reviewText": "Description states, \" you can placed on element that is turned off but still hot without waiting for it to cool down.\" This is entirely untrue. It started smoking and was hot enough to burn my skin when I touched the up side of the cover. I purchased it because I have a kitten who is very curious and has stepped right on the burner while it was still hot. I was hoping that this \"heat-resistant\" mat would protect his little paws if he ever stepped on the stove while it was still hot. Very disappointed.",
