I wasn't sure if I'd like this stove, I verified the return policy said \"Eligible for refund or replacement\" before I bought it. It's actually a great stove, works perfectly and is well-built. It has adapters to fit any fuel source, very stable, very powerful. But for my needs, it's TOO powerful. The flame is so wide and hot that it heats up the extended pot holders on my 750ml pot so I can't touch them to pour out the hot water. I should have gotten something smaller like a pocket rocket. So I tried to return it, but got the message this item is not eligible for returns. LIARS! I'll probably just donate it to Goodwill.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: A company representative reached out to me regarding my concerns about the melted igniter. They have checked with their supplier and apparently the igniter button just didn't work using anything other than plastic. So, the lesson learned is not to completely enclose this little stove particularly around the area of the igniter. Use a windscreen just make sure there is plenty of area left for the residual heat build up to escape without super-heating the igniter. The company was more than willing to provide a refund as well as telling me to simply keep the product - although the igniter no longer works it can still be lit with a match or other flame source. I appreciate that the company reached out to make good and stand behind their product. And, they assured me that they would do so with any customer who had a problem - they simply ask that you reach out to them directly. So, I am now a happy camper. :o)PREVIOUS REVIEWDo NOT use this product with a windscreen as recommended by several of the reviewers - the igniter is not made of ceramic/metal as it should have been - but includes plastic which quickly melted the first time I used it. Not fatal as it can still be started with a lighter - but clearly a product limitation since many will be using it with a windscreen not realizing that it will cause igniter failure. The biggest issue here is that the company does not stand behind its product in that it will not allow you to return it nor do they offer replacement just a bunch of DIY instructions for troubleshooting that DID NOT address the product failure issue. Regrettably, I did NOT see the \"NO RETURN\" policy statement in the Website - if it even appeared there and if it did it certainly is not highlighted for the consumer. This is clearly a \"BUYER BEWARE, PROCEED ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK\" product.",

I love that the connection is on a hose and the adapters can accommodate all types of cannisters. My only complaint is that the legs get extremely hot. They are also the pan rests, so the heat travels down quickly. This stove needs to be set on level ground or a flat rock, not a plastic cutting board.",

I use this stove with refillable propane cylinder.The stove is really powerful, when you give more gas it sounds (and heats) as a rocket :)But this is also a drawback: all camping neighbors hear that you are cooking. I assume the sound is created, because this stove has three small nozzles rather then 1 bigger.I tried to use it to fry potato on cast iron pan: you shoud not set too high power, because the pan's center is beign warmed much faster then sides.I like that it is assembled into a cubic box with 10cm side.Don't forget to let it cool down after use. it is really hot.Overall:Pros: small, powerfull, universalCons: noisy,",
