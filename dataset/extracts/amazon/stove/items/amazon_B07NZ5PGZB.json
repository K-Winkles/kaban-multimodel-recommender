                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased this product. The first time I turned it on, I smelled gas and I didn\u2019t know where it was from. I bought a gas detector tool and used it and found that there was a leak. When I lit the stove up I saw an open flame on the border of the grill, not at the burner where it\u2019s supposed to be! This is an enormous safety hazard. Clearly the product is defective. Amazon connected me with the seller and they have been dragging the communication on for months. If the product is defective, you can ask for a refund per their return policy. They asked me whether the product is loose. It is not loose but it is not the customer's job to fix a product that is brand new. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to ensure that their product is tested for safety before shipping the product to the consumer. I am appalled that this company sent a defective product and did not complete an inspection beforehand. Even further, that they expected a customer to fix a product that is flammable and dangerous. This could have had disastrous consequences for me and my family and I am extremely dissatisfied with the customer service, the utter disregard and lack of care for their customer's lives. I will try to work with Amazon again to resolve this issue.",
