                "reviewText": "The Cosmo 63175 30 in. Wall Mount Range Hood is a great product, and it looks sharp when properly assembled and mounted. The brushed stainless steel finish looks very smart, especially when mounted on backsplash tiles. The suction power is very impressive, the noise level reasonable at the highest setting, but definitely too noisy for the lowest setting.To mount it, I replaced an existing 24\" cabinet with an over-the-range microwave oven. When I removed the oven, I replaced the cut tiles and extended the backsplash all the way to the ceiling. You need a flush surface to mount the hood, as the chimney fascia will not line up with the range unit unless you have all tiles to the ceiling or no tiles at all. They don't tell you that in the instructions.Be also mindful when handling the chimney fascia, as it has sharp edges and it is easy to nick or cut yourself with it.Two things that could easily improve the assembly experience is to provide longer screws with more serious anchors than the 1 1/4\" provided. The provided ones can suffice if you drill directly into drywall, but if you also have to go through 5/16\" of backsplash tiles, they just don't reach quite deep enough to provide a secure anchor point for the brackets.The other major annoyment is the blue protective film. You should definitely remove it before mounting the unit, but even then, there are spots that are an absolute pain to peel off, such as the light assembly and the grilles. To completely remove the film from those parts I had to unscrew the light assembly and remove the LED light fixtures from their sockets. For the grille, there is no chance to do a complete film removal because the parts are riveted together. So, you'll have to leave with some tiny blue film sticking out of your gorgeous brushed stainless steel range hood.Finally, the included flex duct is quite short, and rather than attaching it to other ductwork, you are better off tossing it and getting some 6\" non-Insulated flexible mylar aluminum ducting from your local home improvement store instead. Then, use duct clamps rather than HVAC duct tape to secure it to the unit.",

                "reviewText": "This is my attempt #3 of buying a range hood on Amazon. The first two were bought from a different seller, one arrived damaged, the replacement was shipped and also arrived damaged. Then I bought this one and waited with a lot of anxiety for this range hood to be delivered. I must say that the amount of packaging is impressive. The box had plastic inserts on the outside for the handles so that it is easy to carry and handle with care. To me it was a very good sign. When I opened the box, the product was completely covered with Styrofoam, there were also plastic corners to protect the hood corners and the sides. And it was completely covered with sticky blue film to protect from scratches, inside and outside. The blue film actually looks very nice, a bit of contemporary touch, maybe I will leave on the surfaces to protect from dust and grease. The display is covered with clear film. The only suggestion I would have is to actually cover the area around the display with plastic film for protection. This range hood is a bit smaller than others I looked at, but it it is also lighter, easier to carry and hold. The installation process was EASY: 3 brackets, 2 for the chimney, and 1 for the hood. I mounted the brackets on the wall, and then just hung the hood. It took me 30 minutes. The manual was clear, but I would suggest adding a section that would explain that 1 bracket was actually for the hood. For some reason the instructions start with chimney installation. Logically, I need to know how to install the hood and then the chimney. I figured it out looking at the picture in the manual, but it was not as clear as it could be. The range works great, looks great, I am VERY happy with the product.",

                "reviewText": "We\u2019ve had our Cosmo Range Vent for nearly a month and, overall, are happy with our purchase. As others have mentioned, the installation instructions need improvement. I\u2019m pretty handy when it comes to home improvement, so some common sense enabled me to figure a few confusing things out. However, a novice may have some trouble.The fan itself is a product of China. We selected ours because the price fit into our budget for our kitchen remodel. I can tell that this product is a bit more cheaply made than some of the other name brands that we looked into when shopping in the stores. Time will tell how well it holds up.The unit looks very nice and the electronic controls and display are great. The fan has three speeds. My wife tends to use the medium speed mostly because high speed is quite loud, though it seems to work very well. Cleaning the unit, inside and out, is a breeze. The unit also comes with lights, which we don\u2019t normally use, and a timer that you can set that will automatically turn off the fan.Installation wasn\u2019t too difficult. I recommend an extra set of hands while mounting the main unit and I also suggest purchasing better wall mounting anchors than what are supplied with the unit. Getting the electrical receptacle positioned where it doesn\u2019t interfere with the vent pipe may be a little tricky if you are venting outside.In general, I\u2019d probably recommend this product if you\u2019re looking for something nice that will save a few bucks.",
