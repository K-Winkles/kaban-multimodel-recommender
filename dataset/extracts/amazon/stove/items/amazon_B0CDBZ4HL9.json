I love that all I have to do is wipe it clean when needed and don't have to scrub stuck on stuff like I would have to on my stove. The best part is that it can go in my dishwasher and I didn't even know that until I was reading that while unpacking it. Love this thing! I already cooked cheeseburgers while using it and it was so easy to wipe clean.",
