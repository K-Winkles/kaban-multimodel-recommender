It took me about an hour of doing something else and it hit me - upside down. Both sides look the same - it fits perfect. Unwrapped the side pieces the next day and yep, they go on the sides perfectly to fill in the slight gap between stove and countertop. Not planning to use the cute metal brushes on the stove, but I am sure they will come in handy for something.",

When I got the order the stove cover did not fit at all. I had to cut a HUGE chunk in order for the cover to fit. Also, cutting the edges along with tapping it down. Why the tape? The covers keep lifting from the sides and does not stay in place.The quality is the worst. I thought the quality would be more like a flammable paper or plastic, but this is a thick paper that will burn if it comes near the fire.Why even sell this? Why?My advice to all find something better, durable, better quality, safe, and do not waste your money with this one.",
