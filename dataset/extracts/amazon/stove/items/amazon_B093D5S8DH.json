                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best value \"Pocket Rocket\" -style stove",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. There are many versions of this style stove on the market available from various sellers. The MSR \"Pocket Rocket\" sets a very high standard for this style, but it's also 4 times the price.When I bought this, it was just about the lowest price I could find for this style, and it came with stainless utensils, which was a nice bonus.The piezo ignition is a really nice addition at this low price-point, and it works reliably. The pot supports are four pieces that slide around the base. A spring washer keeps under a little bit of tension and keeps them from slipping unintentionally. The supports slide together to fold up for compact storage or spread out for cooking.The supports themselves flex a little due to the construction and light materials. This is probably the biggest trade-off versus a more expensive, name-brand stove. For small pots and pans, it should be fine, but I don't think it would not be suitable for larger and heavier cooking equipment (e.g. cast iron).The orange plastic case feels kind of cheap and bends easily, but it will work fine if you plan to keep the stove stored inside. The utensils are study and nice quality.The stove fits standard iso fuel containers. Its compact size combined with the wide base of iso containers make it reasonably stable. With an adapter, it can also go on top of a 1lb propane container, but with less stability. I made espresso on a boat (a little wobbly but not rocking, see pic) in this configuration and it didn't tip.Everything about this little stove seems well-thought-out. The adjustment valve folds up and snaps in place for compact storage. The piezo clicks with the left hand while the right hand adjusts the fuel/flame. The supports have little \"feet\" that fold inward to support small pots or outward for pots with wider bases. Everything collapsed nests perfectly inside the Stanley Adventure kit.Overall, I'm very impressed with this stove. For the price, I would consider it a great bargain for camping, backpacking, or emergency kits.",

                "reviewText": "I was quite impressed with its performance. This compact and lightweight stove is designed with outdoor enthusiasts in mind, offering a convenient solution for cooking meals while on the go. However, there's a caveat to its design that potential buyers should be aware of: the size can be deceivingly small.Pros:Compact and Lightweight: The backpacking stove truly shines when it comes to portability. It's incredibly lightweight and compact, making it a breeze to carry in a backpack or even a small daypack. This feature is a significant advantage for backpackers, hikers, and campers who need to save on weight and space.Efficient Fuel Consumption: Despite its small size, the stove's efficiency in terms of fuel consumption was impressive. It utilized a surprisingly small amount of fuel to boil water and cook basic meals, which is crucial for long trips where resupplying fuel might be a concern.Sturdy Construction: The stove's construction felt robust and durable. It seemed capable of withstanding the rigors of outdoor use without showing signs of wear or damage.Cons:Deceptively Small Size: One notable downside of the backpacking stove is its size. While the small design is an advantage for portability, it can also be deceiving. The stove's compact size limits the size of pots and pans that can be used effectively. Larger cookware might not fit well on the stove's surface, making cooking more challenging.Limited Cooking Space: Due to its small size, the cooking space on the stove is quite limited. This could be a drawback for those who intend to prepare more complex meals or cook for a larger group. It's best suited for simple cooking tasks like boiling water or heating up pre-packaged foods.Wind Sensitivity: Like many compact stoves, this one is susceptible to wind interference. While some wind guards are provided, they might not provide sufficient protection in windy conditions, potentially affecting cooking efficiency.",

                "reviewText": "I'm notorious for not reading specs when ordering things online, and when I opened this, I literally laughed out loud :) Thinking I was getting something similar to my husband's sacred Jetboil\u00ae stove (so I didn't have to keep asking to borrow his and being watched like a hawk the whole time I was using it), I was not expecting it to be only 3\" tall. However - it is not only super lightweight and portable (taking up far less space than the Jetboil), it gets the job done, if the job you want it to do is boiling water to make coffee on chilly camping mornings. I love the way it folds up into its bitty orange case, the cute fork and spoon they threw in, and how the little \"wings\" open up and flip out to hold a container on top. It's super easy to screw it onto a small propane canister and the lighter and valve adjusting the gas flow work great. (Note, the silver camping cup shown in these pics is our own, added to the picture for size comparison. It is the one I used on top to boil water in and works great due to the swing out handles which keep your fingers from getting burned.) However...WARNING: unlike the Jetboil, whatever you set on top of it is NOT secure, and the slightest shake of the surface it's sitting on could tip this baby over. So, yeah, I kinda have to watch it like a hawk (and politely ask the hubs to quit shaking the camper around) until the water comes to a boil, but it does that quickly and efficiently. It does get hot, so you have to wait a few minutes to unscrew and fold it back up again (campers savvier than I will already know this.) So, overall, totally worth the $12 or so I spent on it to have my own little heating unit.",
