My only complaint is that other drip pans I have purchased were shiny chrome, and these have more of a satin finish. The shiny ones always looked so new and clean. These look nice, but not the shiny new look I would like. I will keep them since they fit so nicely and are definitely a step up from my current drip pans.",
