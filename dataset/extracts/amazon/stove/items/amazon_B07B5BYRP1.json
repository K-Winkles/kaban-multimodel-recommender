Nonetheless, stay stable even if I place a stock pot (3 ply stainless steel 5 qt pot) on one side of the coil plate.4. the black metal case is super easy to clean. food that gets dropped in this part do not get burned (however, if you spill food on the silver round plate under the coil, it is hard to clean. try not to fill the pot near to the rim.)cons1. kind of fragile. use it gently.don't do stir fry that may cause friction between the pot/pan and the plate. mine went on strong for 4 months only. after doing a lot of stir fry, it applied stress on some connection and it doesn't get hot as fast.2. two coil plates do not get the same power. left performs better than the right. if you turn on both, the performance is decreased slightly overall. however, i am able to boil water on both simultaneously, even though left sooner than the right.although my first plate slowed down in its performance due to \"friction,\" i bought a second one thinking it will last a lot longer if I used it gently.

                "reviewText": "My package was lost randomly. I had to get a refund then a week later it showed up on my porch out of nowhere. The product is light and feels like it is made from cheap materials. To boil water you need to use a quart sized pan. It will boil nothing over that size. I've only used one burner at a time so I'm unsure if one burner gets hotter than the other. There's no way to remove the burner coils so you have to be extremely careful to not drop anything under them, because it's nearly impossible to clean out if you do. Product showed up 2 weeks late, but I got a full refund so I guess I cannot complain that much.",

                "reviewText": "I did a lot of research before deciding on which cooktop to get. I had to substitute a hotplate cooktop that stopped working after 7 months and decided to get a coil one. I've been using it at least 3 times a day for a week now and it's working perfectly. I've seen a lot of reviews complaining how slow this would heat things but I had the exact opposite experience. On the right coil, which is supposed to be the weaker one, I was able to boil a cup of water (around 250ml) in under 3 minutes.For now I am very satisfied with my purchase. For the price, I just hope this can work for a few years. The product offers a 90 day Warranty, but if you leave a review and register on their website, your warranty extends to a full year.",
