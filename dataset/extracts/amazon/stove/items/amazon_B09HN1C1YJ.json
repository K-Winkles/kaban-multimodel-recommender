                "reviewText": "\"Light weight\" is relative. For a backpacker this is not light at all. For tent or car camping, I think this is really light, but not flimsy. I've only used it on 2 camping trips so far, so I can't speak for it's longevity, but I'm impressed with its function so far. I haven't tried to cook anything that was super delicate and needed an ultra-low setting, but I've done fluffy scrambled eggs which need a lower temp, and they turned out great (and fluffy)! I specifically did not want the version of this stove with the piezo lighter. I find that they typically go bad at some point and why spend the extra $20? I use a rechargeable arc lighter that never requires that I get too close to the flame, and I recharge it once in a while. I just prefer that.This stove is super easy to clean. The rack lifts out easily so that I can wipe down the interior and soak the rack if necessary. I don't love the black metal casing because I live in the desert southwest and the sun is intense and heats the black metal up. I bought a propane hose converter from the 1lb connector to my 20 lb tank, and that has worked flawlessly. I have also used it with a 1 lb tank with no problems either. I just prefer not to use the disposable 1 pounders. A 5 lb tank is in my future--best of both worlds, but I digress. This stove boils water pretty quickly (in my 6-cup percolator). Perhaps not as fast as JetBoils or other stoves of that nature, but for an 11,000btu burner (11,000 per burner) it's quick (perhaps about 3-ish minutes). I've had a Camp Chef Explorer where each burner was 22,000 btu and that is major overkill for me at this stage of my camping. That said, I didn't want anything with less than 10,000btu. The stove has a built-in hand grip when it's closed up, so nothing rattling around. As for the propane connector, I made a small bag out the leg of an old pair of jeans that I'd cut off, and it prevents the connector from clanking around inside the stove while transporting it. I would have no hesitation to recommend this stove to anyone if they're looking for a two-burner camp stove that isn't as...hefty as my Camp Chef was.",

                "reviewText": "This product provides plenty of power and space to heat up cookware. The portability for something this size is great, especially with the built in case carrier. Sometimes, my family uses this to deep fry foods outdoors rather than using our indoor kitchen stove. I also purchased a hose adapter to be able to connect a large propane gas tank to the Coleman stove for longer use versus having to change out the smaller Green Coleman propane tanks more frequently.The only downside is that this camp stove does not come with a built-in igniter. Although there are some stoves that have really cheap igniters that end up not working somehow.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for weekend camping trips and emergency use if the power goes out. Tried it out this weekend to cook some pancakes and heat up water for coffee. I don't know why anyone would complain about the build quality. Yes it's not made from the thickest gauge metal, it's thin to make it lighter and it does seem to have a high-quality paint on it. With the adjustable wind guards, I was able to fit a 12\" skillet over a burner. I wouldn't recommend trying to cook pancakes this way, as the thin GSI skillet wouldn't heat very evenly and the pancakes were always have done on one side. I told everyone they were my special Yin-Yang Panckes... very hard to make! I'll purchase the available griddle ( Coleman Camp Stove 2 Burner Griddle ) for the next breakfast meal. It's probably much thicker and better and distributing the heat, plus you could cook bacon and pancakes at the same time. Grate is removable for quick and easy clean up. Propane bottle attaches very quickly and easily. The only thing missing is the instastart ignitor button. I think you have to spend $20 more to get the model with the ignitor ( Coleman 2000012034 InstaStart Triton Stove . Just don't forget to bring the matches or long lighter and be careful when lighting.",

I spent a ton of time studying what is the best way to buy a stove, it's just beautiful, compact, portable, with wind protection, a good proven brand, and I've seen the same one with piezo ignition, I don't need to overpay for it even $ 20, since in such portable broadcasting you need ease of operation, I'll take matches it's not difficult, but all these extra functions and buttons are not reliable, they can sink and break with frequent movement and mobility. The price is just great for such a stove, we used a propane tank, the food was cooked in 15 minutes, I brewed coffee fried kratoshka onion eggs and bacon, it is very powerful and wind protection is really convenient, you don't need to invent anything else, just light the gas and cook. By the way, I took the largest diameter of my frying pan 15 in and it fit perfectly and there was also a coffee kettle on the second burner next to it. I highly recommend this oven!",
