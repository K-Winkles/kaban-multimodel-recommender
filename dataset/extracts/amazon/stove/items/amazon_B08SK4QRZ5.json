The fireplace fan start-up temperature is 60\u00b0C/140\u00b0F.We recommend a surface temperature of 140\u00b0F - 660\u00b0F (80\u00b0C - 350\u00b0C). Exceeding 350\u00b0C/660 may damage the motor. How is working without batteries or electricity? Fireplace fans circulate warm air by converting heat energy into kinetic energy, driving the fan blades to rotate. How to do if the wood stove fan is not working? This may be because the top of the fireplace is not warm enough, when the top of the fireplace reaches 60 degrees F the fan starts to turn. If it does not work at normal temperature, gently turn the fan blade to check for foreign objects stuck in it.",

Because of the location of the stove, most of the house (especially my bedroom) doesn't get to feel a lot of that heat. I bought this little fan and have it pointed to blow heat around to behind the stove, leading to the bedrooms. It works beautifully and has been running constantly for a couple of months without any issues at all. Even when the fire is down to just coals, the fan is still picking up enough heat to keep going. I have it set to oscillating and it has been a huge help in blowing air to the rest of the house. It doesn't require anything, just plop it on the stove straight out of the box. I plan to buy another one to put on the other end of the woodstove",
