The coating is not a bright, shiny black, or as smooth as the oven top (which makes no sense since they are brand specific\u2026). Additionally the coating Is obviously very thin and not perfectly smooth, dark, or as thick as they should be.Do they work? \u2014 Yes, the fit is excellentAre they a perfect match? \u2014 No, not even closeWould you be better off spending an extra $2 at Walmart? \u2014 well, you decide.",
