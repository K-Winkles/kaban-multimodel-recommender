                "reviewText": "This prevents the knobs on my stove from being pushed in to then be able to turn on.My husband and I occasionally push into the knobs and depending on what we had on, and would turn the knobs. I did measure my stove before getting these as it is suggested.Stove knobs have different push-down wedge requirements and you can push too hard and pop off your stove knob. Lesson learned, but no damage just put the knob back on the stove and know not to push that hard. The lock part goes on quickly.The instructions are very microscopic. Seeing that this product is to help keep others reasonably safe from your stove. I watched a video and picture read. I seriously needed a magnifying glass to read these instructions.And these stove locks work. They perform their job.",
