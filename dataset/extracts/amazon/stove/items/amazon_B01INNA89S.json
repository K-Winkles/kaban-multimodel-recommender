                "reviewText": "I have to take a minute to brag on Amazon as well as this grill. I found one from Amazon warehouse that was on sale, it said \u201ccosmetic damage.\u201d Well, I arrived on time but was heavily damaged, it looked like Humpty Dumpty after falling off the wall. I called Amazon, and they had to schedule a pick up, and would not give me a refund until they received their item back...no problem...they scheduled the pickup 5 days later...well...5 days later...no one showed up...so I called Amazon again...the service specialist was awesome. I explained to her the error in the pickup, the damage to the grill, the fact that I couldn\u2019t use it and had paid a lot of money for it, and the false advertising (cosmetic damage my rear). Without any hesitation she allowed the refund to immediately go back on my account, gave me a $200 credit for a new grill, helped me order it, rush shipped it (next day), and scheduled a pick up for the broken one. I was floored by the friendly and easy customer experience.Now for the grill...it is an amazing piece of equipment. I love to cook and grill, and am a veteran, but must warn you, it took some trial and error, even with asking friends and watching videos. The one huge difference is that this thing gets hot, very hot, very quickly. Go ahead and get the dual probe thermometer and before you cook, know the temperature at the grate. It will be much hotter than the temperature on the thermometer. Once you figure that part out, it\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019ve made the best smoked Boston Butts, Brisket, Beer Can Chicken, and Steaks I\u2019ve ever had (no comparison to anything at a restaurant). This is by far the best grill I\u2019ve ever owned. The great thing is that this grill will last forever if you take care of it, and all the parts are interchangeable.One other quick tip...the Jealous Devils lump charcoal is the best and is easier to work with than the other brands. It really does what it says.",

                "reviewText": "This is our first Kamado style grill and it does everything: grilling, smoking, baking, brick oven style. While waiting for it to arrive we watched several YouTube videos on how to light, operate, cook on, and clean this specific grill so that once it got here setup was quick and easy and we were able to start using it right away.It arrived in a nice sturdy shipping box with a pallet. It\u2019s really heavy and I recommend at least two people for assembling and moving. We did notice right away that the gasket seal on the lid has some frays in it. This did not prevent us from being able to use it. I went to Kamado Joe's website, registered it and submitted a customer service request with a picture included and they sent me out a new seal gasket that next day (no charge) and I got it in the mail about 2 days later.Since then, we have used it several times to grill and smoke and have had no issues with operating it and the food has been turning out amazing for us. We did notice the Kontrol Tower (the top where you control the smoke coming out) had paint peeling about 4 days later. I submitted another customer service request with pictures to Kamado Joe and they have mailed out a replacement Kontrol Tower (their spelling) already, no charge.I am really impressed with Kamado Joe's customer service. Although technically I shouldn't have to be submitting issues for a grill I have had for about a week, the fact that none of the issues prevented use of the grill and that the manufacturer is taking care of the issue immediately and free of charge, I felt comfortable giving it a 5 star rating still.I have since recommended the grill to several family and friends and they have been impressed with it. I personally liked that this grill had the 2-tier cooking system and came with everything it did included. The only additional purchases I have in mind are a soapstone and pizza stone.This is a Kamado grill with a good reputation, great customer service, and great cooking results (as long as you operate it correctly). I am very happy with it. I do recommend watching some review/how to use videos on YouTube.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Kamado Joe after my Dad bought his after doing extensive research. I looked at Grilla Grills, Primo, and Big Green Egg. For the price and quality, and the versatility of the accessories and grill plates, the Kamado Joe is by far the best value from what I can see.I had bought another Kamado by a different company that arrived damaged due to a design flaw. After my Dad got his Kamado Joe, I saw the quality of it and how it went together, and was really impressed. So, I bought one also and I am already very happy with it, and already thinking of buying a second one!The grill arrived two days ahead of schedule, and I opted for the \"room of choice\" which I highly recommend, considering how bulky and heavy this is. I had it delivered to my back patio, which is one of my favorite rooms anyway. :)Assembly went pretty well, definitely grab a friend to help you lift it...don't chance it and risk hurting yourself. All of the components are very good quality. The design of the inside ring is 5 ceramic pieces that fit together and are held in place by an aluminum ring. Not the best design, and it was challenging to assemble it at first. Have the friend that helps you lift the grill into the cart also help you with this part of the setup, too...it will be easier and take less time.Overall...5 stars! Best $1,100 I've spent in a long time. Make sure you get the Kamado Joe Grill cover to protect your investment from the elements. Highly recommended. I've only done two cooks so far, but can already tell the difference.",

So far we have produced meltingly delicious pulled pork (an 18 hour low smoke we could never have attempted before); creamily tender brisket; the moistest, tenderest roast chicken ever; and drop dead gorgeous pizza. Even relatively mundane dishes like pork chops and steak are elevated by the Kamado\u2019s fierce but controllable charcoal grill.We bought this because we wanted to do a better job of hosting summer parties in our garden. Now we can cook for 20+ at a time with much less stress, and people love the wonderful smoky flavours we produce. But we\u2019ve discovered that this BBQ isn\u2019t just for summer: I have no spent several Friday evenings outside with a hea torch and an umbrella: I think we may end up slow roasting the Xmas turkey too.If you decide to treat yourself, invest in some good supporting literature. I recommend \u201cPitt Cue & Co\u201d, \u201cThe Hang Fire Cookbook\u201d, and \u201cBerber & Q\u201d.",
