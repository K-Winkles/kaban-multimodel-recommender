                "reviewText": "This is a heavy duty cast iron stove top for propane. I was so excited to get my hand on this because, in my mind, this is a great option for if our power goes out and it occasionally does, we have an additional option to cook food, heat/boil water, and provides some heat. We usually take a propane stove top when camping but ours is a lot more bigger and takes a seconds to set up, pack up, and move. This is fantastic option if you are just going for an overnight stay or if you do not need to bring a whole lot with ya. I have not cooked anything on it but it hooked up to my propane tank with no problem at all and we were good to go.There are legs that prop the stove up, it is cast iron so it has that heavy duty weighted feel, the instructions are simple and easy to follow, overall it is a great stove top. I cannot wait to use this this summer especially when we go to spend a day at the lake, we do not need to bring the kitchen sink with us, but this will make it easier to bring good food without the hassle. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Made from heavy duty Cast Iron, this single burner can handle even the heaviest pots or pans. Some assembly is required. But seriously, it only took me about 10 minutes to assemble this cast iron burner. I added the legs first, then the burner. After that I added the fully adjustable brass valve and knob, then finally the hose and regulator. And it couldn't have been easier. All the parts were there and they even give you an extra screw, washer and nut. In case you lose or drop one. I double checked all the screws and nuts to make sure everything was tight. Then I connected the black plastic fitting on to a 20lb propane tank and lit the burner with a long butane lighter. The flame is adjustable from a low simmer, to a pretty decent medium flame output. The last three pictures were taken with the valve fully open, on it's highest setting. This single propane burner is easy to assemble and easy to operate. And when your done, just take the unit apart and store it back into it's heavy duty cardboard box. Be mindful when assembling this unit though. Some of the cast iron edges are sharp and could possibly cut you (although I did not have that problem).",

The problem there is those things are unwieldy, sit high off the ground, and have regulators that have auto shut off features that are a pain if you\u2019re trying to run them for longer than it takes to deep fry a turkey. This little stand is perfect. It sits low to the ground, and it doesn\u2019t have an auto shut off. It works perfectly with a standard US grill sized propane tank. It\u2019s sturdy cast metal, not pressed aluminum, so we anticipate it lasting a nice long time and not getting easily bent out of shape.",

Once that is done you can test for leaks and then tune the air intake on the burner. I had a few burner ports that did not light until I cleared some paint from the port with a nail. It came with the air control bolt backed out all the way so I had to screw that in by hand to achieve optimal blue flame. Very happy with the performance. Using with a large lobster pot.",
