                "reviewText": "This is a nice stove for the price. Very thin gage and light. Bought 7/22 and tried in yard. Takes a little finagling to put together, about 2 minutes. The hole in one side used to feed sticks into it seems big and the bottom edge is to close to the bottom plate so that the ashes tend to fall out. Bottom plate has holes for air and to let ashes through, they fall to ground. Bag it comes in is the best part, has plastic coating inside and is well made. You could also use an alchol stove in it, as you can raise bottom plate up, has three levels for plate. Good for beginner or novice hiker. Price is right and does the job.Update. I added a piece of metal to the hole that is in front, not quite half way up. To keep it in place I cut 4 slots in the added piece to make tabs on bottom. See photo. The hole doesn't need to be so large, not feeding it logs. Now when burning, ashes don't fall out. I had a piece of stainless steal but a soda can or any tin will work.",
