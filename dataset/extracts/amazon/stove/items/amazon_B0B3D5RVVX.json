It was installed before the dent was noticed, but I see it every day.",

                "reviewText": "The install was pretty straight forward. I had to do some finagling to do it all be myself, but a pair of quick-grips did the trick! So it is all installed...I turn on the power....push the fan button...and i get a inconsistent \"chatter\" of metal. I believe it is due to the buttterfly damper kinda flailing about. Other than the fan, the damper is the only other moving part - but it is enclosed within the unit and the exhaust stack so there is no way to verify that doesn't involve completely un-installing the unit.Other than that - it looks quite sharp, the suction power and fan noise are good (not excellent), and the lighting is exactly what was needed! All-in-all, a good value buy!UPDATE! The chatter is fixed!!The \"chatter\" was NOT the damper! It was the grease grates!!I was on the verge of uninstalling the whole thing...and I just happened to reach down for a tool, and from the corner of my eye I could see the right grease grate jiggling up and down - just enough to make the \"chatter\" noise. I removed the grate and ever so slightly bent the back edge by a tiny smudgeon - a very long smooth arc sp that the back corners would 'wedge' a bit against the top frame. I put the grate back in - and no more chattering !!! Took the left grate out and repeated the ever so slight bend just to be sure. Put everything back together and tested on all three speeds - and not one time did it chatter anymore. YIPPEE!!!",

                "reviewText": "Two years ago, I purchased the 400CFM version from Amazon, and it has been running smoothly. Recently, when the upgraded 800CFM version became available, I decided to make the switch. The 800CFM model shares the same dimensions as its predecessor but offers significantly more power. While the noise level is somewhat loud, it is within expectations for a unit with twin fans. The installation process is straightforward, although the manual is quite basic. Notably, the customer service is impressive, responding to emails promptly\u2014even at 10 pm PST. They promptly sent a free replacement bulb for one that was not functioning properly.",

There is also a visible workmanship imperfection, if you look close enough. The installation booklet is useless, but the installation is pretty straight forward. On the lowest setting the unit is moderately loud, but not terrible at all. Overall, I would recommend this unit.",

The multi-speed fan works well and the light bulbs are easy to change (we installed 3000 K bulbs for a warmer look). We hardwired the hood and only wish there was a small junction box at the back of the hood to make connecting to the power supply easier but managed to get the job done. The connection plates that were included made installation simple. Hope this helps anyone interested in this hood.",
