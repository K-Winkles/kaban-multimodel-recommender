I have used it once to boil a big pot of peanuts. I found that it only takes a small flame about 3/4\" to boil water. The 200K BTU would probably melt the pot. The good news is the flame is very easy to adjust form barely on to the fires of hell by simply turning the regulator knob. The only assembly is connecting the hose to the tank and the burner, both hand tight. The frame is well built and very sturdy and stabile. I wanted something that wouldn't easily tip over and this fits the bill. It looks like it would be easy to adjust the air intake but there was no need since it was good out of the box. I read comments about the paint burning off from the heat but I didn't experience that with mine. But I have only used it for about 3 hours so time will tell.",
