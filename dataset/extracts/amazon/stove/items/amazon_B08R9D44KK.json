                "reviewText": "Pro tip: the drip pan goes BELOW the ring, not on top. You will think it goes on top, because then it looks like all the one-piece options, but no, you will end up with wonky burners that won't lay down flat. Lay in the drip pan first, plug in the burner, then wiggle the ring over & under the burner. Viola, perfect!",
