                "reviewText": "I am revising my review based on my experience with Amazon.Amazon delivered this three times, but no camp stove, which I had to return three times. However, I finally did get it and in time for my weekend hiking trip. During my trip, I found that I was very happy with everything in this kit, it's compact, very durable, and easy to clean. It's great for regular camping, car camping, etc. It is not ultra light for backpacking, unless you only take a few of the items.",

The tea kettle worked amazing to heat up water for coffee in the morning which we used the cups that were provided and they made great serving sizes. Doesn\u2019t get too hot. Pans worked great as well. Made some soup other meals in them. Overall great purchase and would recommend if you\u2019re looking for a nice mess kit that\u2019s on the cheaper side!",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this for our very first camping/backpacking trip. Mainly we are boiling water for our camping meals, and it did that perfectly. The burner unit with it's built in igniter took a few tries at first. There was a point of just enough fuel flow that would ignite the burner. It took some practice, but we got it. We may pair it down to just the larger pot and kettle based on the meals we may prepare in the future. My wife used the smaller pan to eat out of. It's hard to pack up, so pay attention as to how you take the kit apart. The insulated cups were great for our morning coffee, and our evening Fireball. This cook set would be great for a two person multi night camp, and is plenty small enough to take in your backpack. Lightweight hikers could easily take it down to a cup, the burner, the kettle, and maybe the utensils. Otherwise the whole kit has value. Measurement markings would be great in the kettle as a future improvement.",
