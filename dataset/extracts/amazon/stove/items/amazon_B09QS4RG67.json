                "reviewText": "I researched a number of these before choosing this one. I recently switched from a coil burner electric range to a ceramic flat top. I always used my stove as an extra countertop but, after reading all the warnings about everything that can damage or scar the ceramic top, I didn't dare do that anymore and lost a convenient 'counter' space.This is a well made sturdy silicone mat. It covers perfectly, holds in place and is attractive. I read reviews for less expensive mats with a common problem - wrinkles that don't flatten. This mat lies flat with no wrinkles. A great value.",

I simply fold it and place it on the counter when I use the stove. (Which is not THAT often).",
