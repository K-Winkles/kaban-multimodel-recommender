                "reviewText": "I bought my Solo Stove Bonfire in 2022. My wife and I have LOVED sitting next to it in the evenings in the summer. One of the biggest complaints I had about it was that it was awkward to carry it across the yard to dump the ash out of them. Without a handle, you have to wrap your arms around it and carry it against your body, which results in ash coming out of the small holes along the bottom coming out and getting on your clothes.This handle makes it so much easier to carry. You just stick in one end, insert the other into one of the holes near the top and then lift it up. Now it can easily be carried with one hand to your dumping grounds.This is the most reasonably priced of the Solo Stove accessories too. I would recommend this to Solo Stove Bonfire users.",

                "reviewText": "This little handle is really simple. There are no springs, motors, or sensors to wear out. Just a brilliantly designed, attractive, and well made accessory for the also-awesome Solo Stove. Does this stuff cost you? Yes but you are getting nicely made products that serve a useful purpose. Carrying around the stove with two hands kind of sucks. People ask why there's no handle on the stove itself? Well one hot smoldering fire, a five year old's hand and a searing third degree burn you cant even feel because it damages the nerve endings is all it takes for Solo to lose their rep and their increase their liability. So until someone invents a cool-touch handle this is the next best thing. I only hope Solo makes it a standard accessory included with their stoves in the future.",
