I chose this one because of the wattage (1500).Everything works as expected, though the numbers on the knobs are little hard to read in bright light though, at least they are if you have a bit of issue with close up reading.The heating element does heat up, though it takes a little longer to boil water than on my induction stove top. This is not a flaw, and is to be expected from an item that is being used as an \"extra heating surface\".Overall, this is a good hot plate, not heavy at all and easy to pick up and move so it will also work well for travel.Easy to clean, too.",

                "reviewText": "Temperature control and use is very easy with this burner, we don\u2019t have a stove currently so this does a wonderful job to cook anything that\u2019s needed. In fact, it almost feels like buying a whole stove would be unnecessary! It heats up quickly and is easy to clean, just be sure to let it cool off before you touch or clean it as it remains hot for quite a while.",

                "reviewText": "I had another like this that stopped working, this is replacement. I cook on top of my rollator ( a walker w/ seat) and I got a large plastic cutting board from Amazon to put on seat, then I put that webbed vinyl shelf liner you can buy cheap( it\u2019s to prevent the unit from slipping on the plastic Put the hotplate on it, and go to town! I have done big pots of chili, fried foods, omelette, burgers, chicken cacciatore, you name it! It is wonderful. Note: it only takes a 3 prong( polarized) outlet ..the food tends to cook on to the outer metal surface near the heat when you have a spill and it is NOT easy to clean. I\u2019m sure I can find an easier way to get it off, but I got the red, and since it\u2019s painted it\u2019s at more risk of scratching off",

                "reviewText": "They claim it heats up fast and it does if you just heat a spoonful of water as they do in the video. But if you put on a small pot with a couple of quarts of water it takes a long time. With the thermostat (not rheostat) set to max the light was on (indicating the burner was heating) 1/3 of the time so it might as well have been a 500 watt hot plate instead of 1500 watts. When I put it on max I expect it to be on all the time if not most of the time.The burner surface is connected to the body. This is inefficient and makes the whole body and the knobs too hot to touch. Are we trying to heat a pan or the whole room? If you spill or have a boil over the burner surface will rust.The numbers on the knobs are too small plus the on/off lettering is on the sides of the knob where one grips and thus they wore off quickly.I noticed later on that the claim is made that it will keep food warm a long time. The other side of that is that it is extremely slow to respond when the temperature setting is reduced. The way to keep food warm is to set the temperature to warm.I suppose I could say it is nice looking and easy to clean.",

It's perfect for the job - it's very stable on the counter and the controls are very clear with a separate on/off and temperature knob; it gets extremely hot for stir frying/or a steak etc if desired or boiling water for pasta; and on a low setting it's suitable for soups or a slow-cooking stew. I placed it on a large baking sheet covered in tin foil to help make any splattering easier to clean up.",
