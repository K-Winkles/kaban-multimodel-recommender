I started searching for an alternative to stove paint (which stinks and doesn\u2019t last). We sanded the stove down with steel wool and applied the polish. So easy to apply and dries quickly! I had to use two coats on the top, but the rest of the stove looked great with only one. We\u2019ve used the stove repeatedly and it still looks brand new. Very little smell with the first burn. Highly recommend this product!",

                "reviewText": "Sorry for length, but wow, I was absolutely thrilled with this product and I really wish I had taken before and after pictures!!First, the items needing polished/refinished:1. Wood stove installed 2 years ago. Had a water leak above the stove which caused bad rusting on the top.2. Cast iron skillet was on the stove and rusted bad inside and on the bottom.3. Cast iron tea kettle badly rusted inside.(All of these have been sitting like this and not been cared for, for about a year. So rust set in good)Procedure:1. I wore chemical resistant cleaning gloves. This process can get messy, so wearing the gloves is very helpful for all parts of this. Also have a shop vac, or other vacuum handy.2. I used Steel Wool #000 to get off the rust on all of the items. This takes some patience but I was surprised after scrubbing off the rust that there was still a black finish underneath and not bare metal. All of it (except for the tea kettle) was surface rust.NOTE: I was going to use a loose wire brush on my grinder, but after doing it with the steel wool I realized that would have been way overkill and would have probably damaged more than helped. I could see it being useful for somebody with a completely rusted item that goes to bare metal and needs some hardcore cleaning. Still recommend starting with steel wool, maybe coarser grain.3. Vacuum up multiple times after using the steel wool to clear the surface so you can see what still needs to be done (brush tip works best). I used the steel wool, vacuum, steel wool, vacuum, probably 5-10 times before I was satisfied on each item.4. Take a cotton cloth dampened with hot water and get any dust residue still on the surface. Wipe down with dry towel.LET DRY COMPLETELY!!!!!5. Take a soft cotton cloth, apply the polish directly to the top of the stove or to the cloth and spread it around. Work it in good. Let dry.6. You can polish it up after it dries if you want with a soft cotton cloth. I started to, but I liked the finish without being polished, very deep black look.7. After it was dry it didn't really smudge off unless I applied a lot of pressure. I didn't need to use the wood stove that day, but decided I wanted it to cure so I could put the kettles back on. Got it up between 350 degrees and 400 degrees for a good couple of hours. It had a mild odor, but no smoke.KETTLE AND SKILLET: I did the same steps 1-6 for the kettle and skillet, but here are a few added steps after #6.1. Heat oven to 350 degrees and put both in upside down to cure inside for 1 hour.2. Turn off oven and let items cool down in oven. This took along time because they hold heat very well, just go do some other things for awhile.3. Take them out and lather on some shortening on the cooking surface of the skillet and inside of kettle. I lathered on pretty thick, so they were pretty much a cream color where it was applied.4. Let sit for 10-15 minutes, I let sit for 30 minutes for good measure :).5. Take cloth or newspaper and wipe off the excess so your finish looks black again.6. Put back in the oven at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Turn off oven and let cool again.7. Take them out and they will look as good as new and ready to be used for cooking!I will probably refinish the pan and kettle every year with the shortening technique because it creates a nice layer between the cast iron finish and your food.I honestly was so proud at how everything looked I kept telling my wife and she kept laughing, but had to agree that all of the finishes were fantastic.Still have a little over half the bottle left.Highly recommended if you couldn't tell. If your situation is similar, do not hesitate with this product!",
