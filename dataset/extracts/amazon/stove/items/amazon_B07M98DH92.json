                "reviewText": "I have used this burner set for a few days and I'm farely impressed. It seemed like a steal for the price.Top Pros:1. Very seemless and sleek build which makes for a ver easy cleanup. I like that I can just take my dish rag to the tough stuff. It feels and looks sturdy. It's also not very heavy, so very portable.2. It comes with a safety knob to set it to a shut off mode when not in use.3. It has a way sturdier cord than my last burner.4. I like how tall the legs are because it sets it up off of my counter more efficiantly for airflow in my opinion.5. Easy turning knob feature.6. It cooks really well, especially with pots and pans that match the 7inch burners. I use a 10inch cast iron skillet on it as well. It takes just a couple extra minutes for the heat to reach the edges, but it cooks evenly once it's up to temp. I suggest always preheating your pans. Especially if they are thicker cast iron.Top Cons:1. The knobs take nothing to turn them. So if you acidentally bump them without paying attention and you're safety shut off isn't activated, \"them btchs be turnin on\". So I suggests unplugging it when you aren't home especially, if you have crazy cats. LOL!2. I wish the cord was a few more feet long. It's not even 3 feet.3. There is no temperature indicator on the knobs or thermometer anywhere. So while it will cook your food, you never know what temperature it reaches. Although you can definitely figure out the sweet spots once you get a feel for it, I just think it would be helpful. It reminds me of a portable propaine camping stove, but electric.Suggestions:1. Use 7 inch or smaller pans for quicker boiling.2. Splash guard. As my burner set just sets on my counter, the grease gets everywhere. A splash guard isn't a have to, but would cut clean up time down.All in all, it is perfect for me and my partner. We have a small apartment with no kids so this thing proves worthy. I only hope it doesn't poop out after I upload this review.",

                "reviewText": "Arrived quickly but was damaged in the shipping. I contacted the company and they were amazingly helpful and had a new one on the way to me almost instantly. The second one arrived without the shippers crushing it, thankfully. It is very easy to use and easy to clean. Heats up fast and cooks well. The only thing I would point out is that if you are going to try and boil a large pot of water, it may take a while. A smaller pot boiled quickly, no problem, but I had a larger pan (that was probably too big to be using on the hotplate in the first place) and it took a long time to boil. Just fyi. I really love using it, and it is nice to be able to store up and out of the way once it has cooled.Unless you constantly boil huge pots of water, I would definitely recommend this!",

                "reviewText": "Very disappointed in this stove, would never buy again and I do NOT recommend it to anyone. I used this as the primary stove in my kitchenette, and it stopped working without any warning after owning it for just 14 months and using it about half of that time (warranty is 12 months). It's been sitting in the same spot on my counter since I set it up, and there was no damage done to the stove. I unplug it when it's not in use, so there was no chance of a power surge or electrical issue. I never really liked it (see more extensive pros and cons below), but while it was still working, it didn't seem worthwhile to write a negative review. I thought spending a little more money than similar stoves would get me a better product, and for $87, I expected a much longer lifespan.Pros:-slim profile-relatively easy to clean-heated up small items quicklyCons:-on/off markings and heat setting markings rubbed off within 4 months (only dish soap used for cleaning)-took a very long time to heat medium or large amounts of food or liquid (even when using pots that fit on the burner). Once took over 30 minutes to get two quarts of water up to a boil on \"high\" setting with the lid on-left burner and right burner do not heat up at the same rate - right burner was usually hotter-entire unit gets very hot when cooking (maybe all hotplates do this?)-inconsistent cooking times-stopped working after only 14 months",
