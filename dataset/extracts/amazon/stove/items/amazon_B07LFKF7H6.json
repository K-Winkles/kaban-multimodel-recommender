It does a great job of keeping my glass top stove clean and the scrub brush that\u2019s provided and the single edge razor blade that has a handle makes it very easy to scrape off anything that spilled over and needs to be scraped off before you put the cream on put the cream on with the scrub brush that they give you rub it around it does a great job of cleaning up all of the residue from whatever you were cooking and then just wipe it off with the damp cloth, and it looks like brand new, we\u2019ve ordered this a couple times before I will continue to order it as it does a great job for my needs. Also found that it works on my gas fireplace. That\u2019s a sealed unit when I takeoff the the front I can clean it with the same cream and also the inside of my oven door so it\u2019s got a lot of excuses . Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I made the huge mistake of putting water to boil and then getting caught up in a work call. My copper kettle boiled dry and some of the metal left a film on the glass top stove. I did an online search and found most information said this would be a permanent mark - not good, especially in a rental situation. Thankfully one poster mentioned Weiman Cooktop and Stove Top Cleaner had worked for them so I ordered it. It worked! It took a fair amount of elbow grease and patience to work off one layer at a time, but within about an hour I was able to get all the metal film off without damaging the stove top. The pads and scarper worked great. I found it went faster when I let the paste sit a bit before trying to scrub it off. There is no mark left, which is way more than I hoped for. This stuff really works!",

This polish/cleaner works words on food and ward cooked to the range. I use this at least once a week and use their daily cleaner EVERY day. The cleaning pad is great for scrubbing stuck on stains and it dries really quickly; however once you have rubbed this off, the shine is back without a scratch. Keeping the scrubbing pad clean is tricky but I love that it leaves no scratches on your top. This brand is excellent.",

                "reviewText": "This glass top stove cleaner set is perfect. I have a white glass top that gets dirty ridiculously quick. It\u2019s absurd. And because food gets stuck on there so easily, I really needed something rough enough to unstick the gunk, but gentle enough not to scratch up my stove top (esp cuz im in a rental!). This set of cleaning supplies is just right.I will first wipe my stove down with a wet paper towel. I\u2019ll then use the cleaner (a little goes a long way), and I\u2019ll scrub it with the sponge/brush provided. If for some reason that still doesn\u2019t get everything up (which will happen with stoves like this), then I will take the little edge cutter/knife provided and scrape up any remaining bits. After that, I spray it with regular disinfectant as a finishing touch. Works like a charm!I found that if you leave the sponge/brush in a large cup with hot water and dish soap (covering the whole sponge), it\u2019s good as new by morning! At first I wasn\u2019t sure how to clean it because NOTHING comes off of it when you rinse it under water. But soaking it works! Simple. Worth it.Great product, true to description, and easy to use. Def recommend!",
