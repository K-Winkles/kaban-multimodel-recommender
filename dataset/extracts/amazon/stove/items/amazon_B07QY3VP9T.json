The first order came smashed nearly flat and bent/folded, so I returned with request to please replace in box shipping. Return process was smooth but inconvenient to UPS store 17 miles away. The second/replacement order also came in envelope smashed not quite so flat and not bent. I will keep but not ever order again because of shipping method. The liners can\u2019t hold spilled liquid when flat. Plus, they look horrible all crumpled up instead of smooth.",
