                "reviewText": "Yes, this stove tilts. Yes, it's rather light weight. However, it's highly compact and has survived several trips already out into the wilderness. It's simple enough to buy a small rig out of plastic or metal that will hold the propane tank (mine is simply an angle strut support purchased from Home Depot for ~$1.50) that the tank sits on top of for support, and I have no issues afterwards. Before I got the strut, I merely elevated the stove so the propane tank could sit completely vertically and had no issues with that either.The 5,500 BTU seems accurate. I am able to set 1.7L water at a rolling boil in about 7 minutes with the weather at about 55-60 degrees. This is faster during warm weather. We used one propane tank for a good 1.5 hours worth and still had plenty left over at the end of the trip. Excellent deal, and more efficient than cooking over camp fires.I plan on buying a second one to store in case of emergencies. No need to buy sets that are more expensive when this will do the trick nicely. I was able to put on a 12\" skillet without any balancing issues, I'm sure up to 15 inches will fit fine (though the reach of the heat will be limited.. I would keep it at 12\" maximum just for efficiency).I chose this over a butane or mixed fuel just because propane is so much easier to get your hands on, and in a pinch you can also use a blue rhino 5 gallon tank with an adapter to run into this if you want (but that should be stored outside)",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Much better than Coleman products.",
                "reviewText": "Just back from a one week camping trip where we used two Stansport single burner stoves for at least two meals per day as well as additional coffee breaks and heating dishwater.After having problems with various Coleman stoves, both multi-burner and single burner, I chose this model due to the consistent good reviews on Amazon.The fact that the stove doesn't take much room makes it a winner when packing a passenger car with a week's worth of camping gear.A huge plus was the overall stability of the stove. The combination of the stabilizing feet and wide burner easily handled an 8 qt. pasta pot and a 12\" cast iron pan.Burner output was as good as any camp stove, and better than many. It quickly heated coffee water, heated 3-4 quarts of water for pasta quicker than most camp stoves. Additionally the heat control was superior to a number of Coleman propan stoves used over years more reflecting the temperature control of home stoves.This was particularly noticeable when using a cast iron pan, which once heated requires a low, steady heat.A few additional notes: The Stansport single burner stove comes packed in box that is adequate to store the stove in. The base fits over the bottom of the burner providing some protection for the brass nipple that fits into the 16 oz. propane tank. Stansport provides a small protective plastic cup that snugly fits into the female propane fixture of the burner protecting the nipple that pushes into the tank.Unlike other customers my two stove burners were perfectly level and in the future will perfectly hold a two-burner cast iron griddle. I did notice when I set it up at home that I had not seated one propane tank fully in it's base and had the appearance of a bent burner. Once I double checked that the tanks were firmly seated problem was solved.Overall I'm very pleased with the quality of this product.",

                "reviewText": "I like the amount of btu's it gives out. Can boil water in a small kettle less than 5 minutes. You can bring the flame down a very low simmer and doing can fry eggs without over cooking them. Can heat up a skillet to a smoking point to sear a steak. Make sure you check your 1 lb cylinder for leaks before you use it. The stand could be better to a point where I like to see it lock in to the cylinder as a safety from not falling over but I never had it happen. Cooking for longer periods of time the neck of the burner connecting to the cylinder does get warm so becareful. Let it cool off.",
