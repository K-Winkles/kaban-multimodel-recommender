                "reviewText": "Can't do without it! It's flexible, durable and a glasstop lifesaver! Not sure why it is not pre-cut an inch or two closer to 30\", but it effectively covers if centered. For a 30\" glasstop stove, buying the larger size seems pointless just to cover the 1\" edges not covered by this size. It provides a sort of extended counter for lightweight, temporary kitchen itens that otherwise might scratch or stain an unprotected glasstop. It also allows warm pots & pans to be moved around with no sliding or usual scraping of the glasstop. After cleaning my glasstop, this mat covers to prevent nearby splash stains that often make glasstops appear nasty or half cleaned. Crumbs & stains land on top of it, but it's so easy to pick up and clean. It maintains its dark appearance, as the heat dissipating pattern is both efficient & subtly attractive. Not cheaply made, and highly flexible. It's not too heavy, and easy to center for just the right amount of protection. No foul odor noted.Use Zeiss' 8oz mild glass Spray Cleaner liberally on glasstop to eliminate smears & stains seen in most videos. This mat cover protects smear-free sp gloss-top with ease!",
