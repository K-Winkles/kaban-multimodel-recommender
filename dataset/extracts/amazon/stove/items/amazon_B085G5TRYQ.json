                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. After binging some YouTube cleaning videos, I decided it was time to clean behind my stove. I had never moved it during my almost 5 years here, plus who knows if anyone ever had! Of course there was a ton of food particles and dirt, but I felt so much better afterwards. Then I realized I should probably look for something to prevent food from falling in the cracks.When I first bought these, they weren't what I was expecting. I was expecting it to be made of a hard plastic like my parents had growing up and not silicone. Also, it was slightly wider than I thought and I didn't really like the look. After having it for a few weeks, I've grown to like it a lot more! I now appreciate the silicone material because it makes it really easy to wipe clean with a damp cloth. The flexible material makes it easy to readjust as needed. Also, the added width helps cover more space and helps when one side has a larger gap.Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase and hope these will help keep the stove gap clean.",
