                "reviewText": "The clamshell design has been great.The Safety 1st, since it wraps behind the knob, works in a very simple and robust way: pull off your stove's knob, open the safety clamshell and place the metal spindle of the stove knob through its hole, and replace the stove knob on the spindle. Close the clamshell and you are done.I tried some other brands that I would not buy again. For those, the safety mechanism was more complex and depended on the oven knob being prevented from being pushed in before turning. That's when I noticed my burner knobs work that way (push in, then turn), but my single oven knob did not need to be pushed in to turn. Therefore that other brand didn't work on my oven knob, and even on my burner knobs, there was a problem: this kind of mechanism requires on part of the safety unit to be securely stuck to the stove with adhesive, and those on my burner knobs inevitably became loose and came off in short order. Therefore I have repeated my purchase of the Safety 1st clamshell design instead.There are two minor inconvenicnces, forwhich I rate as minor but took away a star:1) The hinge on the clamshell is somewhat vulnerable to heat. Therefore if I broil with the oven cracked open, the bottom side of the safety knobs (facing the oven top) become hot. After a few months, the hinge area become soft-- if bumped awkwardly, they may come apart while hot, otherwise will slowly deteriorate over months. To prevent this, I no longer broil with the oven door held open, and I also rotate all five covers so the hinge faces up away from the oven heat. This problem is not as bad as it seems-- by the time a year or so goes by, the knobs can get dirty (being exposed to stove splatter), so cosmetically I'm happy changing them out.2) In real life use, sometimes you may leave the clamshells open. When open, these hang downward. Depending on your oven, if you open and close your oven, the top of your oven door lip or handle may catch, so if you slam the oven door, it'll crack the hinge off the clamshell. Has only happened twice in two years to me.For the reasons above I just buy a spare set, and once every 4 months or so a single unit breaks, so I replace that from the spare set. I don't mind-- it works and does what it's supposed to do, and would not buy another brand.",

These are big enough that if someone bumped into them, they wouldn\u2019t be close to moving the dial, and they\u2019re super easy to use. Honestly it probably saved us from a bad gas leak. And it makes me feel more safe in case I bump into it. Love them!",

Product seems like it would be good to prevent accidentally turning knobs but because it fits our stove wayyy too loose it feels more dangerous knowing our toddler can just pull the whole thing off. Maybe with comand strips it would be more sturdy. Not sure if Im going to return due to it not safely fitting my stove. The covers themselves seem good hard material, the clear makes it not noticable, and it opens/closes easily after the first few tries straight out of the box.",
