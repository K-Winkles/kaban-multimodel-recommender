Most of the wrap peeled off leaving white colored knobs with blotches of silver finish. Replacement knobs from the manufacturer are $25/each.. $125 plus tax and shipping for 5. I thought I\u2019d try these and they fit perfectly and our stove looks new again for a fraction of the price! Very pleased with this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "Light plastic with metal color coating. Compared to my original GE knobs, they are really cheap feeling. Also, the arch over the **OFF** setting faces the wrong way, even though the are listed as compatible with my stove. I could use them, but they would be upside down with setting **8** where **OFF** belongs. Check which way the D shape on your knob posts faces before ordering and then look at the pics of the knob carefully to make sure they will work for you. The only metal part on what recieved is a small ring inside the artificial metal finish plastic knob, that firs it onto the post. I bought them used, Like new condition. The knobs do look brand newl, but are not metal, don't fit and will be returned. It is notable that there are two (very cheap) metal screws in back, and you might be able to reverse the knob on the back, to make the **D** shaped (that sounds bad but you know what I mean) hole face the correct way, bit the screws look so cheap I think I'd strip them just trying to take the out. They look like aluminum screws. For 30 bucks (used, like new price) It's not worth the effort. I found some on Amazon with a universal D fitting kit, in an 8 pack so I will have spares. Overall. These are NOT better or equal to the heavy knobs that came with my stove. I put those ons in the dishwasher (never do that, oops) and messed up the finish, the plastic clear coat is flaking off. I think these are even lower quality than those. I see many reviews saying numbers and silver color flakes off, I ordered uncoated solid black this time...to avoid that. These did fit on the power burner, thas one plus (some knobs do not, there are 2 posts for that type of burner).",
