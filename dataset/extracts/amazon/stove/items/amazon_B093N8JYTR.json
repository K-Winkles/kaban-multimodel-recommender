Very disappointed the manufacturer cheaped out on the brass gas valves. There is no positive off position, only snugging it up finger tight. From that position it takes moderate force to open valve that does move smooth after that. I would have paid another few bucks for a quality valve(s). Other than that, excellent survival cook top.",
