Our carefully crafted design and flexible silicone material means that our gap covers conform to your gap, regardless if your stove and countertop are level. However, for a better and more snug fit, we recommend that the height difference is minimal. Do they melt on a stove and are they safe for my gas stove? Our premium silicone offers a high level of heat resistance, ensuring that they do not melt if used properly. Our design is such that there is a shorter flap which sits on the stove, with little exposure to any heat / flame produced by your hobs. Are they dishwasher safe? Absolutely! Simply stick them in the top rack of your dishwasher, and they\u2019ll be good as new! Alternatively, you can simply wipe them down with a damp clothe. Can these be used for other appliances / uses around the house? Our gap covers can be used all across your home and the limits are endless. Wherever a gap exists in your home, our gap covers can come in handy. For example, a common use is to cover the gap between your washing machine & countertop or dryer. What size should I choose? It is important to measure your stove length before choosing your size. If the length is over 21inches but under 25 inches, simply opt for the 25 inch and cut to your desired size. We always recommend going for longer to avoid it being too short!",
