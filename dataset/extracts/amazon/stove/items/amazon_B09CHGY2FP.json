                "reviewText": "Since I live in Florida where hurricanes and tropical storms are a regular occurrence this stove can come in very handy in the event of a power outage. Fortunately, in North Florida where I live that hasn't happened in a while but I find this stove is nice to have for other uses. Can also be used for camping or picnics. It's lightweight and easily portable in the included plastic carrying case. Works well with all types of pots and pans just be sure not to use too large a pan that extends over to the canister area or it can cause the butane canister to overheat. Although the manual states this stove is for outdoor use only, I have used it occasionally indoors with no issues. If used indoors just make sure you have plenty of ventilation and don't use it for extended periods of time. I'm not recommending you use it indoors just sharing my experience.This stove is very easy to operate. Just install the canister like in the picture and align the notch on the canister with the tab on the stove, close the lid and ignite by turning the control knob all the way down. The piezo igniter will light the stove so you don't need matches or a lighter. The control knob makes it easy to adjust the flame. Since I have a glass top electric stove this thing comes in handy when I need the quick high heat range of a gas burner. It's also good for seasoning your cast iron or carbon steel pans outside to avoid smoke buildup in your house.The only downside is finding the butane canisters at a reasonable price. They can be pricey on Amazon and hard to find at major retail stores. Have had some luck at Walmart but it's hit or miss as to whether they are in stock. Since these stoves are a staple in Asian cultures you may be able to purchase canisters at a local Asian food market but I've yet to explore that option.The included case has the same labeling on the top & bottom so to make sure I open on the top side of the stove I placed a couple of marks with a sharpie to remind me of the orientation as shown in the picture. These stoves are not expensive and great to have around in the event of a power outage. I think every household should have at least one. Gives you peace of mind that you don't have to miss your morning coffee, breakfast or other meals because of a power outage.",

                "reviewText": "This was actually exactly what we were looking for. We mainly use this for HotPot dinners and some outdoor cooking. It was easy to set up and use. The only con is that I wish it had a case to store it in or some kind of lid to cover the cooktop when storing. Other than that, we are happy with the purchase.",
