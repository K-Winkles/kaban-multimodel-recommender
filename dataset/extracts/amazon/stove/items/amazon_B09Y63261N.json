                "reviewText": "When our kitchen was being renovated, I bought the Cukor hot plate with two burners. It has worked perfectly. It gets hot quickly and stays hot, so the food gets cooked properly. It is as easy to use as anything can be. Just turn the knob under the burner you want to use to high, and you are cooking in no time. It got the water boiling in my 8 quart pot about as quickly as my gas range did. The only issue is that the temperature is either high or off. Turning down the knob just turns the heat off. But that wasn't a problem for us. We just adjusted our cooking time and strategy. The hotplate is easy to clean, and after 3 months of heavy use, it still looks new, and it works just fine.",

                "reviewText": "01/31/2024 UPDATE UPDATE:This little hot plate worked just fine for a little over two years.Then the PLASTIC control knob started getting loose due to the heat distortion and I ended up using a small pair of vise grips to control the temperature.Really?You use plastic for a heat adjustment knob on a stove?How tacky is that?Then it sometimes would turn down/off when I needed it to and then again, sometimes not.Now it will not turn completely off. It gates down to what I would estimate to be about the number 2 setting.So,,, I'm taking back two stars and saving them for something that will last more than a couple years.12/13/2022 UPDATE:Well, it's been almost two years now and this little gizmo is a workin still.I am more than a little surprised that for about $32, this has held up so well./Before this, I bought a Duxtop for about $75-$80 and it only lasted about two months. A total turd!I guess I'll mention that the paint around the heat control knob is coming off which is no big deal at all.And, the control is starting to feel a little wonky but it still works just fine.It still boils a 2-quart kettle of water in about five minutes (about like when it was new).After two years, I have absolutely no complaints about this hot plate.Original Review:09/19/2021 AU:WELL, I'VE HAD THIS COOK TOP FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW AND WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS, IT STILL WORKS VERY WELL. IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO FIND A COOK TOP THAT WILL HOLD UP FOR MORE THAN A MONTH OR TWO.I STILL LIKE IT!!!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've only had this single burner hot plate for one day so this review is an initial observation.It has a weight and feel to it that makes you think it is a high quality product.The heat control moves smoothly and does not feel loose or wobbly.The plate heats up reasonably quickly and boils a 2-quart pot of water in just a few minutes. I even used my cast iron wok on it and it performed very well.The non-slip feet all touch down at the same time so the appliance is not wobblyI have gone through a few hot plates with less than stellar luck over the last two years so I will monitor this one and check back with a review update from time to time.For now though it seems like an all around winner.Thanks//(~_~)\\\\AU",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this hot plate just a few days ago. I am very impressed with the fast delivery and quality of the package! Hot plate heats up quick and holds the heat for a while after it turns off, which is great when you want to keep something to stay warm until you are ready to eat. This will be great for carrying in the trips during hurricane season and also will be great for college kids. So far I am very happy with the product. Cord is also a nice length.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a small size kitchen or kids in collage.",
