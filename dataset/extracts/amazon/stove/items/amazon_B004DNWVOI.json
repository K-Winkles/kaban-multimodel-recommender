That said, these are a perfect fit for my 1980s dinosaur Kenmore. I have tried multiple \"universal\" type replacements with poor luck. The burner coils never seated properly resulting in tipping pots, wobbly pots and uneven cooking. These are absolutely perfect, well made, attractive and best of all, level, stable pots and pans! I have used the large burner on high heat and noticed no discoloration. And with this exceptional value, especially with prime, I will no longer be spending hours with Brillo pads or steel wool attempting to get them shiny again. I am going to order a back up set and simply replace them. I will provide an update if any wear problems pop up, but so far so good. Thank you whirlpool and Amazon!( I may try the black next time to match the black oven door and make a fashion statement! )I forgot to mention that I received these a day prior to the estimated delivery date, couldn't be happier. Amazon prime is the best.",
