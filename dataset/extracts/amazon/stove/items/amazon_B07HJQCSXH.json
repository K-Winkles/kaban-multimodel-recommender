I'd say the only thing that's less than ideal is that it takes a long time for water to boil for things like rice or pasta, but it will get the water to boil if you give it time. I love it for the rest of my cooking!",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Poor design for heat transfer",
                "reviewText": "I bought both products below:1. The Proctor Silex Electric Single Burner Cooktop, Compact and Portable, Adjustable Temperature Hot Plate, 1200 Watts, White & Stainless (34106). ASIN #: B086BYH8LJ2. The Ovente 1700W Double Hot Plate Electric Countertop Coil Stove 5.7 & 6 Inch with Dual 5 Level Temperature Control & Stainless Steel Base, Easy Clean Portable Cooktop Burner for Cooking, Black BGC102B. ASIN #: B07HJQCSXHThe Proctor Silex pros:-Heats significantly faster, and water is actually boiling-Easy to clean (you can lift up the coil)-The coils have more surface area (i.e. more coiled metal) so it heats faster-The coils have a flat top, so pots/pans stay on it much betterCons:-The power cord is very short. I had to get an extension cable (as you can't use a regular extension cable or you can start a file) with enough electrical capacity to carry the juice, such as this item: 12 Ft Appliance Extension Cord Heavy Duty, Gray - 14 Gauge 3 Prong SPT-3 Cable for Air Conditioner or Refrigerator (ASIN #: B07ZS2X5VB)-The power LED comes on the moment you plug it. But to be fair, this is working as designed because it's a \"power\" LED that shows when it has power and NOT an LED that comes on when you actually have the knob turned to on. It's a poor design, but it is working as designed.The Ovente pros:-It has two burnersCons:-Cooking things on top of it, sometimes the pots and pans move so you have to use one hand to hold the pot/pan, such as when cooking eggs. This is because the top of the coils are not flat, and some parts stick slightly up higher.-Water did eventually boil after a significant amount of time longer than the Proctor Silex, but the water appears to \"simmer\" more than boil. I believe this is due to the fact the coil has less surface area to make contact.-Power cord also very short, but slightly longer than the Proctor Silex. Still, it's too short and I needed a powerful 14 gauge power extension to use it under the vent.-The unit itself got much hotter than the Proctor Silex, so you can easily burn yourself if you're not careful.I would purchase the Proctor Silex again. I wouldn't purchase the Ovente again. In fact, since it's dangerous as things can fall off the coils AND it doesn't seem to heat as well and takes a long time before water actually boils, I'll be returning it.",
