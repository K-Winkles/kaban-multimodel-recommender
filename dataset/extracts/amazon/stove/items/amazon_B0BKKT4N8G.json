In my case one grate was still off balance. I proved by switching out grates, it IS the stove area is not level. Here's my hack if this happens to you: Using a correct blade, slice off the head of an old foot. Then turn the sliced off rubber head upside down (so the cut side is upward) and glue it to the foot or feet that shows up uneven. Viola now level. I soaked the old worn out feet in water and saw the that small crumbs got in around them. For my stove, had to push down hard with the silicone in place to get them to pop in",
