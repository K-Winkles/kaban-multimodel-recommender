                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to replace the sturdy but irregular propane two burner Coleman stove that was handed down to me and is at least 25 years old. I read the reviews on this and decided to give it a shot. I took it camping and was blown away - the igniter works fine for both burners; the heat output on high is phenomenal and it went down low enough for me to cook eggs. The quality seems excellent to me and it\u2019s so super easy to clean. The two wind guards folding out from the sides are held in place securely by the same two clips that secure the lid for transport. The top will fold down completely if needed for larger pots/pans. It looks so nice that I\u2019m hesitant to leave it out in view when I\u2019m not in the campsite. I do hook it up to a 5 gallon propane tank because I know it will blow through the gas. I run it off of a multi connection propane tree mounted onto the 5 gallon tank. Im able run both my lantern and the stove going on full power. I do recommend getting a filter between a tank and the stove. My only regret is that I waited so long to buy this!",

                "reviewText": "After years of use, my old Coleman camp stove finally reached the end of its useful life. The hose connection between the stove and propane tank had either been damaged or was simply worn out from usage and had sprung a leak.Replacement parts were no longer available.I was about to order a new Coleman stove but decided to check some online resources for reviews on camp stoves.In six different reviews, the Camp Chef Everest 2X rated #1 (4 out of 6), #2 (1 out of 6) or was in the top four (1 out of 6).I was particularly attracted by the products high BTU ratings.I decided to purchase the Everest 2X.Being late in the camping season when I received the unit, I did not immediately open the carton to inspect and try-out my new stove.However, before stowing the camping gear completely this year, I decided to check out the new stove.Sometimes, despite our best efforts, things just don\u2019t work out as expected. The new stove was received with some manufacturing defects.These things happen.I contacted Camp Chef, and they replaced the stove with a completely new and different unit.Upon receipt of the replacement stove, I took it for a trial cook-out and it performs beyond expectations. The high BTU capability is great, and the materials and workmanship of the product is outstanding.When things go wrong with a product or service (and they will from time to time) how the issue is addressed is what differentiates manufacturers and service providers in their customer service level.I recommend the Everest 2X for those in the market for a camp stove. I also recommend Camp Chef as a company with outstanding customer service.Check out their full line of products on their website.",

                "reviewText": "We have used this a couple times. As has been noted, it could use levelers, but that's an easy workaround with anything handy to use as a shim. The controls are very precise. My previous, cheapy stoves were hard to adjust and just wouldn't turn down low--they'd either fade off or run too high. Not the case with this one. We were surprised that the fuel consumption was not as bad as we expected. We just use the green disposable cans (actually, we recycle them), instead of connecting to a refillable large propane tank. On a three day, two night trip, with five cooked meals, I think we only used up one can. (However, we heat water for coffee on a separate jet-boil system).I would say, on the downside, the stove is fairly bulky and heavy, and a little difficult to carry, but the positives far outweigh these negatives.",
