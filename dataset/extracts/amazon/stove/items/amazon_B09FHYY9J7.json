                "reviewText": "This stove worked very well, with plenty of space for larger pans. However, becareful with the brass connection for the propane bottle--Mine came slightly bent. (The box was damaged) I was able to bend it carefully, by screwing the connection tube/fitting on it. It passed the soap bubble test. I also had to use plyer to squeeze the locking clamps as they very easily came detached. So there are build quality/packaging issues. Overall, it is an attractive stove, that lights very easily using the ignition. It cooks/heats quickly. The middle (3rd) burner does toast well, though you have to rotate the bread as you go. It's still a better option than the traditional stove top tool for toasting.",

The controls are difficult to operate and sticky. The \"toasting\" feature underneath is basically unusable. Unable to support heavy cookware such as cast-iron. You would have to use lightweight aluminum to cook on it or it might crush it.",
