She was a Hairdresser, and did people's hair from home when I was a little girl. I do my own hair now. So I don't have to use my daughter's gas stove for my hot comb anymore. Makes her happy.",

                "reviewText": "This oven gets really hot and fast. It works just like the ones in salons I\u2019ve gone to. I also like that you can extend the part that your hot comb or curling iron handle rests on - I use it to rest the comb on it when the comb is too hot. Definitely recommend this oven - a real time saver.",
