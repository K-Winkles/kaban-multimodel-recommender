But from 5' away I can feel a draft. Pair that with a a ceiling fan in the next room and the two together move the heat throughout my entire upstairs living space. The only thing that disappoints me is that it now makes a rattle sound. It was totally silent the first two uses and now rattles. It's not a big deal to me. But when it's advertised as silent, and is silent at first, it's a bummer when it makes noise. Its not that terrible of a rattle though. That's the only reason I deducted a star. Otherwise it seems quite reliable. Oh and the oscillation is wonderful. This little guy starts spinning and oscillating when it's thermometer hits 190\u00b0 every time. As soon as it starts spinning I know my wood stove is ready to latch the door. I would recommend this product.",

It\u2019s got very little power, barely feel air movement when my hand is 3\u201d from it!!To check I placed a thermostat in the middle of the room ( 12\u2019) from the fan. Noted the temp before fan, then placed the fan on the wood stove, after an hour there was no difference in temperature. If the fan was doing its job it would be moving the hottest air from the stove into the room . It does NOT! It\u2019s virtually useless and I don\u2019t know how people review anything otherwise!!",

A couple of the fins were bent backwards against the unit, so it would not move when I first pull it out of the box, got it as straight as I could. Not sure about the longevity of the quietness of it because of the fins. But it\u2019s a cool little feature and I\u2019m sure it moves the heat a little bit. You can\u2019t feel it from more than 10 or less inches away though.",
