                "reviewText": "After 6 years of using a wood stove, it was time to give it a makeover. With litle bits of rust showing here and there, I needed something to bring back that \"new\" look it had when I first bought it. I found this polish and thought to give it a try. After a light scrubbing with a scour pad and a good wiping down, I applied the polish with a small brush and then rubbed it in with a piece of cotton cloth. I did this about one week before I was going to use the stove as the weather got a little colder. As expected, the stove smoked a bit as it did when I first bought the stove, so, I opened the windows to allow the smell and smoke to exit the room. The smoke and smell burned off after a couple of burns (as it does when new) and now the stove is so beautiful and without smoke and smell. The polish is just what the wood stove needed and sure does put that \"New\" look back to my stove. I have a medium size stove and the 8oz bottle has enought in it to polish the stove several more times. This polish applies easily and though I don't know how long this first application will last, I'm very happy with it. This polish is in a liquid form and not like shoe polish (paste). It easily gets into small cracks and crevices and works as intended when applied correctly. Yes, it smokes at first, but the end results are worth it. Y'all take care.",
