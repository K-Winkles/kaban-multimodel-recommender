I kneeded the tube a bit, as per directions, then I put a generous bead around the stove door and pushed the seal back into place. I closed the door & let it sit for the rest of the day. The next day, I fired up the stove & checked to see if it was over the temp required to cure this stuff. (Over 550\u00b0) No fuss, no muss. No cleanup due to being careful with the application.

                "reviewText": "We use this to fix leaks on our wood stove as recommended by the shop we bought our stove from many years ago. We cleanup best we can, then squirt this stuff into the seam to fill in the gaps. Then let it cure per directions on the package. The liquid texture is great for small gaps down low, but a huge pain for top outside gaps where it drips all over the place.I just pulled out a tube I bought over 5 years ago and it dried into a paste. I ended up having to slit open the tube to scoop it out, and use my fingers to spread it into the gap.I wish they sold this in a spreadable paste since this semi dried up version was far easier to work with. I hope this old stuff sets and holds!",
