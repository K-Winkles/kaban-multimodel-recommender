                "reviewText": "I almost cancelled the order when I realized that my stove wasn\u2019t flat on the top, but I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t! Because the shelf is an adjustable length with two pieces that slide together, I was able to extend the shelf enough for it to bend downward just a little at each end and still stick very well to the top. I did have to do extra adjusting to make sure the back of the shelf was flush to the wall so that it couldn\u2019t move as much, but it wasn\u2019t a problem and only took a few minutes. I think some extra sticky pieces I received might be to hang the shelf less permanently on the wall instead, as well since there were holes where it could be hung on the wall traditionally. It\u2019s long enough that I could have it hanging off a couple inches on either side if I wanted, so it\u2019s pretty big! As the picture shows, it holds a lot of spices in all different sizes, even my large salt cellar. The metal is thin enough to be lightweight, but thick enough not to easily bend, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s fairly sturdy material. I feel it was well worth what I paid!The only downside I see is that the magnets have a peel-off back and are meant to be stuck to the stove. My partner and I may be moving soon, which means the magnets will likely need to be replaced, and I like the firm stick the magnets give over the idea of sticking it to the wall because of the weight. I may try to take them off and stick them on wax paper to see if they\u2019ll work after being moved, but if that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll be a little bummed to have to buy more magnet strips to stick down. Still highly recommend this product though!",
