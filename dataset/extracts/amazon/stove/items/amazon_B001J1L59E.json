Next, fill base with water to the level of the safety valve. Replace the funnel into the base and fill it with ground coffee; do not press coffee down. For best results, use fresh roasted, finely ground coffee. The recommendation is to use a 6-to-1 water to coffee ratio. For each tablespoon of coffee, use 3 oz. of water. Tighten the top to the base. Make sure the top is completely screwed on to the base before putting on the stovetop. Heat coffee until coffee percolates to the top. Make sure the handle of the espresso maker is not over the heat source. Remove from heat and serve. Enjoy!",

I like cappuccino \u2018s mostly , but the most important thing use good strong coffee. I also have a Nespresso machine but it\u2019s fun to try different types. I would buy again I have the six cup one. It\u2019s also easy to clean. But the handle is plastic so don\u2019t put on the heat I have an electric stove I just put it on the outside and use a mitt when pouring in cup. I think it is well made and not too expensive.",

                "reviewText": "This Primula 12-Cup Aluminum stovetop Espresso coffee makers is a copy of Bialetti Moka Express Stovetop Percolator at half the price. I have used Bialetti for almost all of my life until I moved to the U.S. I used Bialetti for a while but was disappointed with the coffee quality (due to the beans, not the Bialetti per se), so I switched to different other systems trying to get the perfect cup of coffee (I have actually tried them all, so I really know what I am talking about). I finally settled with Nespresso, which is the absolute winner in coffee making around the world. As I wrote someplace else, the only better coffee you can get, better than Nespresso, is at a coffee place in Rome named La Tazza d'Oro, near the Pantheon -just google it up and you will see pictures, etc.If you want to know my opinion, Bialetti system comes #2, very very close (to the point that if you do not want to spend big money on Nespresso machine and/or be forced to buy their capsules, Bialetti IS the way to go), but it all depends on the coffee, obviously. Something you do not need to worry with Nespresso because you always get consistently the best possible coffee, every time, no matter what (this is a very important consideration, because depending where you live, you may not be able to buy excellent/outstanding coffee beans, so you will never get a great cup of espresso with this machine. Also, I do realize coffee is above all about personal taste, so you may be happy with a regular Joe at your local convenience store ... nothing wrong about it, it is your coffee, I am just talking from the perspective of a European person who is absolutely obsessed with coffee and tried dozens of varieties and systems ... the only part of the coffee industry I am not familiar with is the actual growing of it, but I am actually planning on to join an enterprise venue in Guatemala and Costa Rica so I can also speak from that perspective as well).Anyway, now to this Primula. I have tried it with Costa Rica coffee from cost co, and with and the results were great, as far as I can tell, same as I remember with Bialetti, The difference of the prince may be due to this being a new brand (for as far as I can tell), so they want to get some share of the market and their products are being marked down. Also, this is made in China, which is a bummer to tell you the truth. Bialettis are made in Italy, and you can't beat (you can get close, but not surpass) the quality of aluminum products made in Italy. Finally, I jut got this machine a couple of weeks ago, so I can NOT tell you if this is durable, or speak about the quality on the long term. Usually, all the Bialettis I purchased and used in the past lasted forever, literally, and me purchasing a new one was because of gifts, or because I needed a smaller/bigger one, etc. As a matter of fact, these things make better coffee as they get older.If you are planning on purchasing this, I absolutely recommend you to do so. Go ahead, you will get great espresso coffee on your stovetop IF you spend some good money on good quality coffee (most of the coffee sold in the U.S. does not fit that category). Also, beat in mind that this is a huge coffee maker, for 12 cups of espresso which is designed for family breakfasts (6 people or more). If you are planning on using this coffee maker for 2/3 cups of coffee, get the smaller one.I hope my honest review was helpful. If you go to Spain, France, Italy, almost everybody has one of these (Bialetti, most likely), and nowadays people also have bought a Nespresso machine in addition to this one, but this one is still being heavily used.Enjoy!",

                "reviewText": "After working as a barista for several months, I quickly discovered that I was addicted to espresso, be that in shots, mochas, or lattes. However, upon seeing the price tag for espresso makers (and for drinks at Starbucks), I realized that I'd have to be creative to get my espresso fix at home.I shopped around for alternatives and I quickly settled on moka pots. Something you don't have to plug in? Something that's cheaper and much less wasteful than a K-Cup maker or a coffee brewer?? Something that does espresso-style coffee (or close to it) that's NOT $1000??? Sold! I resolved to give it a whirl, and looking around, found this maker.I'm confident to say that this was a pretty good buy, especially if one wants to have a moka pot that doesn't break the bank. It's quite reliable and straightforward to wash, though there are a couple of things that do get in the way:- First of all, the size (3 cups) is MERCILESS with handling. It's definitely a little dance to try and get a good grip on the handle after it heats up. I usually wore an oven mitt when I picked this off the stovetop since I was sure I'd burn myself otherwise.- Second, the plastic handle partially melted over the stove when I put it too close to the center, so it's pretty cheap in that regard. The rest of it's solidly built though, and hasn't rusted or anything despite my not cleaning it too often.- Most importantly, though, it's a bit too small! While a lot of that's on me, the other part of it is that the coffeemaker stays too hot to make myself another batch right away, to strengthen any drinks I've made.Another thing that needs to be said, too, is that you've got to be a bit picky with the grind of your coffee as well. A moka pot needs a medium-fine grind - somewhere between regular coffee and espresso. I'd recommend you buy pre-ground coffee at first (Lavazza Qualita Rossa is a great one to start with) and if you're willing to commit, then get a coffee grinder and go nuts!With that all said, I'm likely to try and pick up a better quality one sometime soon that's a bigger size now that I'm a full convert. Still, this is by no means a bad product, especially if you're unsure whether a moka pot's right for you or you have a college student budget.",
