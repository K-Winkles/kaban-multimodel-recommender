                "reviewText": "First of all, depending on how you intend to use this, consider the 15,000 BTU unit instead. This works OK and will certainly come in handy if/when I ever suffer a prolonged power outage. I should have bought this years ago since I live in Florida, but thankfully, I have not been affected by a power outage after a hurricane. One of the primary reasons I purchased this unit was to be able to do some hot water bath canning. I have a glass top stove and they are not recommended for hot water bath canning. It's very hot here right now and I really didn't want to use this outside to do a batch of jelly. After doing quite a bit of research I felt safe using it inside. I did purchase a carbon monoxide detector 'just in case.' I also opened a couple of windows to created a cross draft and had no issues at all. My daughter also told me she has seen cooking shows on TV where they use this type of stove. I realize the manufacturers have to put the recommendation to only use outside due to liability. And I certainly would not use it in a small, enclosed space like a tent or shed. I'm not recommending anyone to use it indoors, but just saying do your own research and then make an informed decision. My only issue is that even using the propane fuel it took a very long time to get the hot water up to the temp needed. I don't blame the stove for that .. it's rated for only 8,000 BTU I believe and I thought that would be sufficient to use with a hot water bath. It did get the water hot enough to boil, just took a long time to get to that point. It seems well built for a camp stove. I have always preferred gas stoves to electric so I will probably use this from time to time depending on what I'm cooking. I ordered the 15,000 BTU version of this stove after making the jelly since I intend to do more hot water bath canning. While I have never used the butane canisters, I like the flexibility and option to use butane if I so choose. The storage case is nice to have and the set up is fairly easy. I do think the instructions could be a little more clear about setting up the propane option. Watching some YouTube videos it appears they have made changes to this unit over the years and I was unable to find a recent video that matched the propane connections exactly that are on the unit I received. I think this would make a great camping stove. It's small, lightweight and can be set up in just a few minutes. It may not last as long as a Coleman, but it's not priced like a Coleman either.",

                "reviewText": "Bought it for 32.99 at time of purchase. I was looking for a backup alternative to heating things up while camping.The cool bits:-This thing can pump out a good amount of heat. I've used it on a couple camping trips and mainly used it for boiling water and heating up food in a pan. I've yet to make a gourmet multicourse meal with it but, hey, why would you buy this for that? Brings water in my aluminum kettle to a boil very quickly. I swear I turn around for a bit and its spitting steam out by the time I look back.-Portable. Take this with a grain of salt because that can mean different things in camping. I'm not saying this is your next backpacking buddy. I'm saying comes in a nice black plastic carry case for your carry-to-car convenience. You flip the top grill upside down so it goes into the unit and its snug in its little black house.-Easy to use. If you even just glance do a passing glance at the manual which is like 1 page with pictures, you'll be able to understand all of the TWO things you need to know about this gas stove. I've yet to try out the propane mode of this but the other reviews says it works perfectly. Butane is so cheap and available.The ehh bits:-Honestly not really anything bad to say about the unit. It does what it needs to do and it does it well. You'd really have to TRY to mess this up for you to have complaints.-The grill top is a decent size but if you're trying to heat up something with a small diameter, it may not sit on the grill top. Keep that in mind if you want to heat up your aluminum camp mug with it.TLDR: Its a simple machine for a specific purpose but it does it very well. Not really anything to speak badly about as long as you're not unreasonable with your demands. Its a steal at around 30 bucks. You can use if for camping, emergencies, cookouts etc. World is your oyster.",

Although I haven\u2019t used butane with it, using a 1 lb bottle of propane gave me consistent flame. The igniter is always positive and lights up at every turn of the knob.2). DurableIt\u2019s mostly made of sheet metal, but pretty strong to my experience. Although I haven\u2019t dropped it & won\u2019t do so, nothing is falling apart. It is very well made.3). VersatileEven though it\u2019s only a one burner, having the versatility between a propane & a butane is a must for me. I can use whichever is available & less expensive.4). CompactIt\u2019s small, squarish design is extremely necessary for me since I have very little space in my trailer. When not needed, I could quickly remove the propane bottle & place the burner in it\u2019s carrying case to store in a cabinet or just anywhere out of the way. If using a butane, no need to remove it from the unit to stow away.5). Highly PortableNot only that the design is compact, but it\u2019s pretty light too. Even with the additional weight of a one pound bottle of butane, I had no problem taking it anywhere I set up camp, even in my backyard (lol).6). Fair ValueBecause of all the positive things I mentioned above, I believe this purchase is at fair value. Other brands or even just other sellers charge at almost twice.SHORTS1). Only One BurnerUnfortunately, it\u2019s not available in a two burner set up. That would make life much easier. Good thing that I also have an electric induction cooktop. I use it along this unit when demand dictates it.Thanks Gas One for not regretting my first purchase of your product. I\u2019ve been recommending it to everyone I talk to regarding camping or survival.",
