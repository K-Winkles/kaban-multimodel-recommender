                "reviewText": "I was surprised at how well this gasket worked. I was able to easily measure and cut it to fit using a regular pair of scissors, and it tucked right into place. It stayed put too. It does not come with directions, but there is a yellow backing to the strip of adhesive that you will need to remove prior to placing it. That is pretty self-explanatory, but it did take a little bit of work to get the backing off of the gasket material and that can make you wonder for a second if it needs to stay. There was plenty to fully enclose the channel for our vintage wood stove's door with two layers for me with a few inches of material left over. It is thinner than expected as it does not completely fill the depth of the channel as the older gasket did, but what it lacks in bulk it makes up for in function and performance. It works really well and makes a much tighter seal than the one I replaced. If you prefer to have a thicker gasket, simply purchase two of these and run 3 or 4 layers through your channels, and you will be pleased. I am so far. It adheres well to the metal in the channel, even when it is hot, and it also adheres well to itself. I'm pleased overall. I am docking it a point for not including any sort of directions as a lot of people probably wouldn't realize that the yellow strip needs to be removed first, particularly if you are replacing a rope-style gasket that does not use adhesive, and this would prevent it from adhering. Keeping the strip intact would certainly lead to poor performance and unnecessary frustration.",
