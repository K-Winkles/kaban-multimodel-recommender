                "reviewText": "This camping stove is really cool. On the left, you have a traditional stove burner that will heat up a small pot, pan or skillet. The manual recommends a 10\" vessel as the maximum size. On the right is the grill. Unlike the other Coleman stove with two burners, this one comes with feet that can be attached temporarily, or screwed on for a more permanent arrangement. The feet elevate the stove above the surface of whatever it's sitting on. This allows a small grease tray to be fitted under the grease drain hole in the grill.It cooks quickly, so keep in mind that you will need to be pretty attentive to whatever you're grilling. This is not going to be a \"low and slow\" cooking method. The grill is designed to be compact for camping, so the heat source is very close to the griddle. Don't burn your weenies! Attached is a photo of both the burner and the grill in action. Overall I was very pleased with the performance of this item and would definitely recommend it. We actually own both the more common Coleman 2-burner stove and this one, so when camping we can cook on three pots/pans/skillets and a grill all at once. Camping is not an excuse for poor food. :)",

For just a couple of people this grille seems perfect, it gets very hot and searing should not be a problem, I have not actually used it but did a burn in on it for 15 mins to burn off any residue left inside. Takes up very little space storing in the RV... I placed a pan of water on the burner and it was boiling in no time. I think it will be a keeper and will update this when I use itUpdate.... I am camping now and this grill is wonderful... on the lowest setting it will sear a steak and grilled chicken breast is wonderful... it is perfect size for 4 people... the side burner percolates coffee fast... this grill gets very hot so watch the food closely.. I put a sheet of foil under the heating element for fast cleanup... takes very little room... you have everything you want in a grill Compact and gets very hotOk I don't know how long I had this thing but I used it about 10 times and then the flame started acting weird... The grill would work but if you turned on the burner the flame would go real low... Guess it was a regulator went bad or something, anyway , I trashed it and I am now in the market for a more reliable one. Your results may vary, I loved the design but it just didn't last for me.",

I have used their products since I was a little boy hunting and fishing with my father and grandfather.I bought this style while living in CO. and have used it in more places than I can mention, camping just below tree line at tree line (13000 ft.) while elk hunting, fishing the Flaming Gorge in Utah, riding through the desert jeep trails of Moab, taking it on my raft for week or more long floats down the CO river starting at Pump House, camping in Yellowstone and even cooking in site view of Mt Rushmore. I took this thing around the country many times. It will keep working through snow storms, light rain falls, (you won\u2019t be grilling in a down pour!) pretty much anything nature has to throw at it. It has been flipped, kicked, submerged, ETC\u2026 I literally abused it for years. We have now moved to HI and left most of my gear in storage. I had to purchase this again so we can BBQ on the Black Sand Beach in Hana, and when taking my son hunting on Lanai for axis deer, so we can cook the strap and he can get the real taste for freshly grilled meat. We just used it to make breakfast up on Haleakala watching the sunrise a couple of days ago. This is also the perfect thing to have for emergencies, we all know they happen, form power outages, hurricanes, blizzards, and many other natural disasters. Shipping was on point, living on Maui that is not always the case. The site said a day and between certain times. It was at my front door exactly as promised! When taking it out of the box it is as shiny as a brand new car. Now, I am a father, a chef, and a more than average outdoorsman, so cooking and participating in all outdoor activities with my family is a very big part of my life as you may be able to tell in reading this. If you can\u2019t count on your gear when you are out miles away from anything and anyone, you are up the creek without a paddle per say. Having this item and knowing the Coleman line, I can honestly say that I do not worry about it what so ever! Do yourself a favor, if you like the outdoors and are out as much as we are and you like to cook your catch the way that it should be, then buy this. Thank you Coleman for making your products reliable and something that I can trust always working!",

One burner is 14,000 BTU and the other burner is 20,000 so if you purchase one and see both BTU's on each side of the box, that is why is there are two burners..",

                "reviewText": "Nice little grill stove combo, I think Coleman is spot on with this product...Recently got back from a 2 week overlanding trip thru the Yukon and down the west coast of B.C. and the grill stove was my only cooking appliance aside from fire pits at campgrounds.During the trip I used it to grill steaks and chop\u2019s, fry potatoes and make toast, boil water and fry bannock... the side burner is very typical of a Coleman burner where it takes a gentle steady hand to get a low simmer from the control knob, the grill side is much easier to regulate temperature but partially due to it being at times marginal to produce \u201cenough\u201d heat... don\u2019t get me wrong it does a great job cooking steaks and burgers but if you want a nice sear make sure you pre-heat the grill for a bit... it\u2019s not a typical patio BBQ with BTU\u2019s to spare.Cleaning is not the most convienient feature of this grill but it is manageable with some practice.I did use a large aluminum frying pan on the grill side of the stove many many times and dident have any trouble however I wouldn\u2019t put a cast iron pan on it and you need to watch how hot it\u2019s getting closely to avoid melting the grill.",
