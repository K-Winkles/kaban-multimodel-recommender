This is a nice way to protect it and keep your kitchen looking beautiful at the same time. When not in use you can hang it on the wall next to your stove like I do. it has a little loops for hanging and it looks great. I do recommend this product. I did also purchase another silicone mat to put under it because I didn\u2019t think it needed extra protection with me dropping things the way I do. It\u2019s not as thick as it could be , but it\u2019s still well worth it. I was on the fence about giving it five stars, I went with four because I think it would be really nice if it were a little thicker for more shock protection if you drop something. But if you\u2019re just looking for scratch protection, then this is five stars.",
