                "reviewText": "Our little iSiler induction burner gets used virtually every day, often more than once. It gets used more than our Bosch gas cooktop. Why? 1) It is just as fast or faster than the gas burners. It's a lot faster heating oil in a fry pan, and a little faster boiling water. 2) It has tremendous precision. I set the temperature and don't have to worry about whether I'm using a better or lesser pan. 3) It's much, much easier to clean. 4) It improves our indoor air quality.I make omelettes most mornings and it's awesome for that. I can set the temperature to 200, put in some frozen, add a little oil, and thaw frozen garlic. While I chop veggies, the garlic thaws, turn up the temperature to 320, and in a minute, it's ready for onion, peppers, etc. When the veggies are ready, I turn it down to 300 and put the eggs in. It's sooo much easier than cooking on gas. We stayed in a condo with a smooth (non-induction) electric cooktop. They had a better pan, but I couldn't get used to how long it took to heat the pan or how long to drop the temperature.18 months later, well 19 months, it still works just like it did the first day. I wholeheartedly endorse this product.",

                "reviewText": "I originally purchased this to replace an old butane fondue burner. It worked great for that application though the fan can be a little noisy at times. I started using this as an extra burner when making complex meals. I really like the heat control so have tried using it a couple of times to make stock. You can precisely control the simmer but unfortunately the unit shuts off after an hour or so, so it's not applicable for dishes that must simmer for a long time.",

                "reviewText": "A conditional good review based on my first impressions and a short time of use. I bought this after using the Nu-Wave induction product of somewhat different design.First,the isiler has a robust heavy cord, plenty of length. I was really looking for the \"touch screen\" style control which this unit has. Everything is under the glass top.The new wave had push buttons underneath a non replaceable plastic protective flex cover that ,on both units, cracked where the buttons were pushed on both units after a relatively short period of time(1 year or less), obviously making the control susceptible to any boilover or spilled liquid. A very serious design flaw which seriously shortened the usefull life of each unit. So I was sold on the underglass touch controls of this unit. I had a little trouble at first until I realized that you have to linger for a split second each time you want to activate a button, a wise safety precation to prevent changing your setting by just brushing against or dragging a pot accross the top. It's probably in the directions , but once I figured that out it it works great, just what I was hoping for. Power output is fantastic, it will boil water suprisingly fast, and the output is as good or better than the nu-wave, which is more expensive. As others have stated, the 40 degree temp jumps just doesn't cut it as my old one would do 10's and that does matter. It's not a deal breaker for me and if it's durable I'd take this over the nu-wave anytime.Fan noise is completly acceptable to me but I'm pretty deaf.It has a very neat ,simple,functional look which I really like and it looks great on my counter.The whole top is a flat rectangular piece of glass, so it is super easy to clean.If you have never had an induction countertop cooktop like this they are a fantastic addition to any room you might want to use as a \"kitchenette\" occasionally. I use mine to cook smokey foods like bacon even outside sometimes although they are not meant to be used outside I guess.This unit is a little more money than some of the other units sold here at Amazon, but I like the look of this one, the reviews are very good and I think genuine, and you will notice that any issues are addressed or at least acknowledged by the seller which counts for a lot when I purchase.I really used my old ones a lot and I would be satisfied with 2 or 3 years use the way I use them so I'll be finding out.12/12/2019Ater using this for a few weeks I wouldn't knock it down any but certainly would have to say it needs more power settings, say, every 20 degrees instead of 40 within it's total range. Also I find there is really no \"keep warm\" setting as the lowest temp setting is too hot for my smaller pots The wattage readings are very close to actual draw as I tested them. A \"pause \" function would be great. That being said, I very happy with the flat glass top with all the controls underneath, which looks great and is really easy to keep clean. Overall it works very well.It has it's own learning curve, which I'm sure is a little different for each brand.It's a little noisy, but no more so than the microwaves that I use.Touch contol responsiveness is just right. I thought it might trip when wiping down the top but it does'nt. Looks great on the counter.It' a good deal for the price and maybe future versions will incorporate more settings range.10/17/20Had this about a year and it's held up very well. I use this unit a lot-I mean I do most of my cooking on it in a small kitchenette in the upstairs of my house so it's really had a lot of use.If I got a couple years out of it I'd be happy for the amount I use it. Wouldn't change any of the observations I made.Still love the flat glass top,so easy to keep clean, and definitely needsmore power setting increments.It was a good purchase .",
