                "reviewText": "I find the ecozoom versa and its clones like this product to be a little mis-marketed: the true niche is camping, specifically car camping. I cooked for 3 days using just this stove, no jetboil, did not use my BioLite camp stove, didn't cook over the campfire at all. This thing is very simple and very robust and produces an enormous amount of heat. I kept 4 liters of water at a rolling boil in a wide pot with the lid off. Only major challenge is dealing with the hotspot in the middle of the pan, but a cheap stainless steel heat diffuser has really helped with that.TLDR: a great piece of camping kit.",

                "reviewText": "It appears to be sturdy. HOWEVER...it arrived damaged. There was no damage to the shipping box so the best I can think of was that it happened in the factory. Amazon wouldn't let me return it and deferred me to the manufacturer. Emailed a few times. Got a couple of responses and now they've been radio silent. Haven't tested the stove yet because I want to replace it so I have no say on how effective it is as a stove. Will update if I get a response.",
