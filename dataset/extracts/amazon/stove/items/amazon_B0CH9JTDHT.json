It looks like the fireplace protection mats. I don't love the way it looks on the stove, so if you have a nice looking kitchen not sure it makes sense to keep it out as it ruins the look. It's also wrinkled (shows the folds) and it's been almost two weeks, so I am not sure when they will come out (I roll rather than fold when I put it away to cook and it still shows the fold marks).Other than that, it does offer extra working space and you can use the stove top faster (don't have to wait for it to fully cool, just to cool down a bit). Easy to put away as it's simple to fold. Easy to clean by just wiping off (though it has a slight texture which makes things stick more to the surface). Fits well, more or less (not as nicely as in the listing photos but not bad).It's ok, gets the job done, if visual aesthetics is not a concern.",

                "reviewText": "I use silicone mats on my induction cooktop to keep the surface clean and scratch free. Although this mat works on some kettles it didn't on the smaller ones. The mat is too thick and not made for that purpose. This is a great cover for smooth top stoves when you need additional counter space, or when company comes over and your stovetop needs cleaning and you want to hide it. We've all been there.",
