                "reviewText": "Yes that burner has a little issues, but very minor if you own hummer you can fix it easy, I had the same problem as someone who gave 1- star for the uneven surface, meaning the pot is wiggling on those 4 metal support rods, but if you have basic hummer using skills you can fix that in less that 5 minutes, just give few gentle bangs with the hummer to lower one or two of those uneven rods, and your pot will stand perfectly stable. Also the round burning part was not properly leveled, but I fixed it by adding 1 extra washer under the assembling screw and I was able to adjust the burner with one additional washer. to perfect level.Other than that the burner work very well and even on low to high flame, browning my onions golden brown in few minutes. I couldn't wish for better deal for this low price. One person complained about slow cooking, well, I think, he probably had low supply of propane gas so his flame was low. I love how well is made and how well it cooks for that low price. I must say I got more for what I payed for. come on people! be realistic, if you want low price you have to lower your expectation!!! I am very happy with this purchase.",

This is compact, strong enough to withstand my clumbsiness, and gives better than expected heat (if you remember to bring fuel). Not perfect, and not handsome, but way good enough.",
