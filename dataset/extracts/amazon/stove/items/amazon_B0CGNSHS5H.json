                "reviewText": "I haven't tested its heat resistance yet, but it was very easy to flatten it out on my table for a couple hours (it arrives rolled up into a tube), and then install it under my gas burners on my Samsung 5-burner gas stove.I was skeptical, because I wasn't sure how many models of Samsung there are, and I don't even know what model my Samsung stove is, but I hate cleaning and polishing stainless steel, so I wanted to take a chance and get this cover for my stove.It is perfect!!! I'm so excited to see a future of not having to polish my stainless steel stovetop anymore, since this thing is very clearly a wipe-clean type mat.If I notice any issues with heat damage or scorching on the mat, I'll come back and edit this review with an update. But so far, 5-stars!",
