I opted for this 1\" wide to be sure I had enough material stuck to the glass in case the adhesive wasn't the best. Thankfully the adhesive stuck very well ! A couple helpful tips are to thoroughly clean the glass it attaches to, and to warm this stuff up a bit before peeling & applying, thereby ensuring the stickiness.",

We found a vintage oven after a year of searching but the only thing wrong was it lacked a gasket on the door to keep the heat in. Since the gasket was unavailable by over half a century, I decided to try this tape.Not only was it easy to install and trim to size, it also works wonderfully! I\u2019m so happy the oven now heats in 10 minutes instead of 45 minutes, also the outside of my oven stays cool now that is to this product.",
