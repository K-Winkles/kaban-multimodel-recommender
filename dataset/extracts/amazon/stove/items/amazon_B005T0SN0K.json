                "reviewText": "As a college student, I can confidently say that the IMUSA USA GAU-80305 Electric Single Burner is a lifesaver. When my roommate and I first moved into our apartment, we quickly realized that the stove was in desperate need of repair. We were stuck with no way to cook our meals, which was a problem since neither of us wanted to live off of takeout for the entire semester.That's when we stumbled upon this electric burner. At first, we were a bit skeptical - could something so small really cook a full meal? But we were willing to try anything at that point, so we ordered it and crossed our fingers.When the burner arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by how compact and lightweight it was. It was easy to set up and plug in, and we were ready to start cooking in no time. We decided to make pasta for our first meal, which was probably a bit ambitious for a single burner, but we were feeling optimistic.As we waited for the water to boil, we started to get a little nervous. The burner seemed to be taking longer than we expected, and we weren't sure if it was going to be able to handle the task at hand. But just as we were about to give up hope, the burner suddenly kicked into high gear and the water started boiling rapidly.We quickly added the pasta and were amazed at how well the burner was working. It cooked the pasta evenly and quickly, and we were able to make a delicious meal in no time. We were so impressed that we even decided to make garlic bread on the burner, which turned out perfectly crispy and golden brown.Of course, there were a few hiccups along the way. At one point, we accidentally spilled some sauce on the burner, which caused it to start smoking and set off the fire alarm. It was a bit embarrassing, but we couldn't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation.We found that the burner was also great for making breakfast foods like eggs and pancakes. It heats up quickly and stays hot, so we were able to cook our meals without any issues. We even experimented with making stir-fry, which turned out surprisingly well. Of course, we had to be careful not to overload the burner, but we were able to make a tasty meal nonetheless.One thing we did notice was that the burner can get quite hot, so it's important to be careful when handling it. We accidentally touched the side of the burner while it was on, and it was definitely hot enough to cause a burn. But as long as you use it with caution and common sense, it's a safe and effective cooking tool.The only reason we didn't give this electric burner a full 5 stars is that it does have a few limitations. For one, it's not very powerful, so it can take longer to cook certain foods. We found that it works best for small meals or for heating up leftovers, but it might not be the best option if you're cooking for a large group of people.Another limitation is that it doesn't have temperature control. There's only one heat setting, so you can't adjust the temperature based on what you're cooking. This can be a bit frustrating if you're trying to cook something that requires precise temperature control, like candy or other confections.That being said, for the price point, the IMUSA USA GAU-80305 Electric Single Burner is a great value. It's affordable, lightweight, and easy to use, making it a great choice for college students, campers, or anyone who needs a portable cooking solution. Plus, it provided us with plenty of laughs and memories during our semester of cooking adventures.In the end, we give the IMUSA USA GAU-80305 Electric Single Burner a solid 4 out of 5 stars. It's not perfect - it can be a bit finicky at times, and it's not ideal for cooking large meals - but it's a great solution for small spaces and temporary situations like ours. Plus, it provided us with some much-needed entertainment during an otherwise stressful time.",

                "reviewText": "This product doesn't last long. First two I got one didn't work at all brand new and the other stopped working after tw uses.I received an exchange. Got two other ones. I tested it out and they both turned on and off after trying it four times. Not using it but just turning it on and off. Well. My 3 of my 4 burners died out. I am using 1 and the imusa electric stove top. Well...it lasted for 2 weeks. 2 uses a day. That's 14 uses then it just completely died. Not sure why. It's kept clean. Not kept plugged in.Poor quality. Glad I got it when it was half what it is now. I personally don't recommend this product. Too many issues and the fact it doesn't last longer than it does. Buy something with better quality.",
