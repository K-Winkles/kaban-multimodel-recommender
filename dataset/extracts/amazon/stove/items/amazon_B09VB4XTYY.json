                "reviewText": "We use this two burner cooktop at our beach apartment in Mexico. It sits right on top of the counter and the sleek design looks beautiful in the kitchen. We never use more than two burners at a time, so for us, this is perfect. These burners are powerful as well as totally adjustable down to the simmer setting, which reduces to a small concentrated flame in the center of the burner (perfect for making rice). This cooktop cleans up so easily it is rediculous and the black, mirror like surface does not scratch! Some have expressed concern over the grates that the pots and pans sit on while cooking, but we have had no issues regarding this. Large pots for cooking pasta or making soup sit right on top and smaller pots are able to be centered on the \"teeth\". Awesome cooktop, especially for the money!",

My mistake. Contacted the seller. Seller said to keep the original and sent me another. That one came in damaged too. After fiddling with it a while I realized it was not worth the time to fix. Cheaply made. Burners were crooked etc. Couldn't straighten them. Press on the burner it moves up and down. Hmm? Never even tried to cook on it. I my view its junk. I guess there is a reason you cant return it for a refund. Wont make that mistake again.",

                "reviewText": "First, let me say that this worked good. I had to use this the other day for the first time and it got the job done. It looks nice and both burners work well, even when using them at the same time. I had 2 issues. There was a rubber like seal around each burner plate. These were torn when i opened the box. I don't know if this is supposed to protect the glass top from the heat or what but the edges on the silver plate are so sharp, I am unsure on how any seal would hold up over a period of time. The only other issue i had is the pot holders. They did not fit any of my pots very well. Because the pot holders were angled inward, I had to stand there and hold the pot the whole time to make sure nothing slid off the burners. This was kind of a pain but it still got the job done. I like the way it looks so i will start looking around for larger pots that fit better than \"Normal kitchenware\" And no, i don't have any weird pots and pans. Just a normal set that you would pick up from wal-mart, sams, or even on amazon. Although the hookup was very easy, having to stand there and hold my cookware, or even having to buy specialty cookware is not a great experience. If they changed the pot holders to work with standard kitchenware, then this would be a 5 star no doubt.",
