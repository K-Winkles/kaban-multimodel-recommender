                "reviewText": "We live near the coast in Florida, so hurricane evacuation is an all-too-frequent occurrence. We have our go-kit stocked with non-perishable, survivalist-style freeze-dried foods. They are only edible after mixing with water and bringing to a boil. So, a reliable stove and one that is easily transportable is a necessity. I am nearly 80 years old, so carrying around heavy things is not something I enjoy. This small stove is light and easy to handle.There are some issues with the stove, like not having a wind deflector and not being a high-output stove, but for our needs, it is perfect. When we evacuate, it is not to a shelter, but a nearby hotel or motel where I can take the stove outside to set it up and prepare the freeze-dried foods.One more thing, and it is very minor, but I love the bright color.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice small simple burner stove, portable -practical. Used on 4 day camping trip it cooked great! The wind will slow cooking time and make heat uneven, quick fix I used aluminum foil baking lids to make a wall around the stove or if only a single burner used i left one side up. The tall grates are somewhat awkward, especially for a clumsy person who does not cook -writer of this review, its very easy to knock the pan off balance and the eggs fall on your shoes. The only other negative i found is the clip that is supposed to holds it closed is not good it does not work or mine is just broke. This stove is ideal for me, simple, lite weight and small, fold and go eat.",

You have to wiggle it around to fit the two sides together. Just seems like they could have designed that better. Also, the video review that mentions the closure latch is right: the latch comes open as soon as you grab the handle to pick it up. This is a small thing tho; hardly worth mentioning.",

                "reviewText": "This product design itself is awesome. It's like a pancake maker, folds away nicely and fits in small plastic bins. Lots of space for larger pots and pans since it doesn't have a wind guard. Of course it also means you haven't have a wind guard....The placement of the propane tube is in the back, which requires you to have a deeper table to place it on. Most stoves have the connection on the size, which requires you to have a longer table. So it's based on your situation, that makes this an advantage or disadvantage.As with all coleman stoves I've had to date, the know to control the flame suck. It's too high, or off... there are youtube videos to show you have to take it off and wipe off the grease and put on different grease in less quantity. But we shouldn't have to do this.One side of the click lighter stopped working and coleman sent me a new one to replace it. So for customer service, it's the best.",

                "reviewText": "This worked better than expected with a camp travel stainless steel pot. But the shape of the burner wire stands for use with anything other than a pot or cooking container with a completely flat bottom surface is difficult. I tried an aftermarket folding camp oven with this burner and the 3-loop grate against the bottom of the oven which was contoured made the oven rest unevenly/angle not horizontal which was dubious at first but got my food cooked without the oven falling off the stove grate top. As for the stove operation itself, the burners were fine using a 1 lb propoane tank for flame height and heat force. The only suggestion is whether folded or opened the thickness of this stove is a bit thicker than desired for easy travel such as storing in a bin because it is so thick and the width/length is maybe a couple of inches longer than ideal but guess better for use with large pots too. Would buy again, but wish had different product sizes/thickness for space saving. The opened unit plus space for propane tank and metal hose does take up a good amount of tabletop surface space.",
