                "reviewText": "This stove was not easy to assemble because it did not have any instructions or pictures. The pre-cut holes were not aligned or either not pre-cut all the way. So we had issues putting the screws in. If we did get the screws in, it would not be aligned. The shelves are flimsy. The stove comes with a propane hose and valve connection. Overall it is decent for when the electricity goes out and you need to be able to cook. We are a family of 4 and it helps in emergencies but I would not use it on a regular basis. We did finally find instructions on the description of the item on Amazon, you'll find a pdf file with the instructions. I wish we would have known that sooner.",

                "reviewText": "This really helped out when we needed something to take with us for our road trip as we camped around. The extra shelves really come in handy to store food especially if you have a net to cover your food. It heats up well and is sturdy enough for what we need it for. Setup was a bit difficult, we managed to figure it all out in the end\u2014 well, my husband did. Great for camping or if you\u2019re doing long road trip across country and avoiding hotel stays. Overall it\u2019s a good stove to use. I took a star off because it\u2019s not as sturdy as other models I\u2019ve seen, and could be sturdier with better materials. I still would recommend this though because it does cook meals well and it can be travelled without taking up so much space. It\u2019s still a win in my opinion.",
