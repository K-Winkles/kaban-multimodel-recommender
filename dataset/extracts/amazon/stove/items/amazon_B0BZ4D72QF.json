            "Excellent Structural Design:The structure of the rocket stove achieves a chimney effect by allowing hot air to rise and sucking in more cold air at the bottom, improving combustion efficiency and making the fire more powerful!",
            "High Quality:The rocket stove is made of 0.072\u2018\u2019 thick Q235 steel, which does not deform even at temperatures over 1500\u00b0F, with a stable structure and a load capacity of over 130 pounds at the top, making it very durable. The surface of the rocket stove is sprayed with a high temperature resistant fireproof finish that will not peel even at temperatures exceeding 1500 degrees Fahrenheit.",
            "Ease of use:This wood-burning stove can be used by simply installing a pot holder at the top and an anti-tip bar at the bottom.The wood stove combustion chamber is tilted, and the wood ashes will automatically slide out after burning, making it easy to replenish the wood.",
            "Easy to carry:Equipped with a storage bag, measuring 8.85 x 13 x 3.93 inches, the woodstove can easily fit into the bag, which weighs only 5.62 pounds when loaded.It is convenient to carry and does not occupy much space. It is an ideal choice for outdoor use.",
            "Wide range of uses:Suitable for camping, hiking, outdoor cooking, mountain climbing, and disaster prevention. The materials to fuel this wood stove can be found anywhere, such as twigs, leaves, weeds, sticks, etc."

Burned off any oils and suck from manufacturing. When the smells burned off I threw my cast iron skillet on it and fried up some fish. Used nothing more than the twigs from the trees in my yard.. I think that it would be great for camping for 1-2 people, more if you have the time as you can only use one pot or skillet at a time.. I'm happy with it",

We had a pleasant experience with our grands grilling cheese sandwiches with our new stove. They had so much fun gathering twigs and it only took about 15 minutes to start grilling. I was very impressed with the quality of the stove and the ease of use strong construction and thoughtful design impressed me! You won\u2019t use this for backpacking in the wilds it\u2019s too bulky to carry far but that\u2019s a good thing as it shows the quality of the construction. What does it need? Not much! The paver was a handy solution to prevent the deck from the heat.",

If you need to boil something for a few minutes like pasta or rice it is a bit flaky. At least on my stove the air vent always flips back open meaning if you have enough fuel the flame may be too hot. I had a hard time to keep the heat controlled causing the pot to boil over every so often.Best used with a wider pot or pan with metal handles.Vent / flame control is marginal at best. A tray for the ashes would have been nice.",

                "reviewText": "If you like camping this thing beats the hell out of a propane stove. It doesn't get as hot but you don't have to worry about stupid propane bottles running out and all that other nonsense. You could push it into duty for backpacking if you wanted to carry it it's relatively small I doubt it would fit in your pack but it comes with a nice little carry bag and it doesn't weigh anything especially since you don't have to Lug fuel around with it. And it's considerably better than those little folding junkers they sell for backpacking. I have had no trouble cooking meals for three on this thing. The secret is don't overload it it will choke and keep the ash area clear so it can properly draw. Playing with this thing I've used sticks I gathered up in the desert I cut down store-bought firewood into chunks about 1 in by 3 in and I tried charcoal briquettes and even Cow Patties this thing Burns it all.. it took me about an hour in a light Breeze to cook a 20 inch cast iron skillet full of burrito Stuffins. Was about two and a half pounds of ground beef onions refried beans seasoning. And it did it on three loads of the 1x3 inch cut up seasoned firewood. And I didn't have to hunch over a campfire getting smoked out to do it. I'm probably going to buy one or two more of these things to squirrel away in my prepping gear. I like this one over the others because this one you can dampen down and simmer stuff or keep a pot of coffee warm.",
