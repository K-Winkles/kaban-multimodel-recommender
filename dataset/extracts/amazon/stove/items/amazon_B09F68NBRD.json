This is due to the depletion of the protective coating on the heating element. After 1-2 normal uses, the smoke will automatically dissipate (usually within 30 minutes). This is normal and no need to worry.The burner transfers heat to the pot by heating itself, so do not directly touch the stove surface during use (Note: Heat will also be transferred to the knob, causing the knob to become hot).After the burner stops working, it takes about 20 minutes to cool down, which can better keep the food warm.To make the burner work quickly: 1. Preheat before use; 2. Use a pan to cook as much as possible; 3. Use a lid when cooking.Since the hot plate emits heat when in use, please place it on a high temperature resistant surface!",

                "reviewText": "Ok. I have no stove in my basement apartment. I was using 1 of those cheap electric burners from the big blue box store (you know the one) and it could barely boil 3 cups of water. Not only that but it was impossible to clean.This 1 is soooo much better I can't beloeve it. When I boil my 3 cups of water I have to turn it _down_ because it boils so hard it splashes everywhere. I have boiled 3 quarts of water with no problem. I have not tried more than that. The knobs do get hot, but not so much that its usually a problem for me. I also set it on a cooling rack inside a cookie sheet so the fact that the whole thing is hot is a non issue for me.The user manual warns about the device smoking the 1st time you use it. IT DOES!!! It set off the smoke detector, and my upstairs roomate came downstairs to find out what the smoke smell was. There was smoke coming out of every single opening, even from behind the knobs. It did not all burn off with the 1st use either. It took several uses before I no longer noticed the smell. My advice, take it outside, plug it in, and let it go until the smoke is all gone before you use it inside.Now it's something I use daily and am so pleased with that it makes me smile every time I use it.Im thinking about buying another...Highly recomend!!!",

Had it one for about 5 hrs continuous use. Medium high temp. Did GREAT! Plate burner is big enough for my all American pressure canner too.Very happy so far with its slim design and ease of use. Sturdy very nice quality.",

Although the lodge had a separate communal microwave and refrigerator, it was more convenient to use the CUSIMAX Electric Hot Plate in our room to heat our dinner, which worked very well, and can be used for other hotels that do not offer heating or cooking capabilities.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this hot plate on sale and because our oven was on the fritz. While we were waiting to get the oven fixed, we decided to get a hot plate to get some semblance of normal back in our home with cooking dinner vs. ordering out. I also can tomato sauce and pickles in the summer when the garden is in full swing, so I can always use another burner. The good: It heats up just fine and can be adjusted to a decent degree of accuracy, just takes some getting used to. A pot of hot water to boil 2lbs of pasta took about 8-9 minutes and then it took another 12-14 minutes to get to al dente. A bit longer than a regular burner, but as a backup, it worked great. The not so good: The labels on the unit seem to have been written in erasable ink because they\u2019re all but wiped off, and we haven\u2019t really cleaned the unit yet (have only had it for about 2 weeks). Also, the warning light only goes in when the unit is powered in, however the hot plate stays very hot for quite a while. Be careful not to touch, I already burned my fingers twice because I didn\u2019t realize my wife used it to make tea. Finally, the unit gets hot, so if you think you can pick up the unit while it\u2019s on or shortly after turning off, think again. The sides get just as hot as the burner. Otherwise, it gets things hot, so it works as we need it to.",
