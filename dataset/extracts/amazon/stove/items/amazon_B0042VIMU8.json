Using this high quality material makes the grill both sturdy and highly resistant to rust and corrosion. Includes a full size removable grease tray for easy cleaning. Dual Lined, Single Piece Hood The hood on the Bull Grill is a dual lined single piece construction that eliminates weld spots which could potentially cause rust, helps insulate the grill to keep the heat tapped in, and keeps the grill looking great by protecting it against heat discoloration which is achieved by keeping the external surface away from exposure to direct heat ensures the grill will stay beautiful for years. Solid Stainless Steel Grates The Bull cooking grates are solid 304 stainless steel all the way through. Solid 304 stainless steel construction, as opposed to hollow, transfers heat better for more consistent cooking and will last a lifetime and are guaranteed for life. Piezo Igniters On Every Burner Piezo Igniters are simple, independent ignition systems that are designed with the least amount of wiring to directly ignite each burner. Each Piezo Igniter is protected by a stainless steel housing so food drippings do not interfere with the spark igniting the gas from the burner.",

I made a silly assembly mistake with the shelves and contacted the seller, who responded promptly with the fix ... which I really SHOULD have caught myself. Totally my own error and one easily rectified.A suggestion: the electric transformer (for internal lighting), if purchased, would be much more easily installed at the BEGINNING of the assembly, with the cart laying on its back, maybe before or right after the casters. At the end of the assembly per the instructions, with the cart vertical, it's pretty awkward contorting to get those four screws in. (The buyer just needs to be advised which box the transformer is in.)",

Very impressed for the money. Way out performs anything that Weber makes.Updating after significant use. My initial review was tainted by past ownership and little use. The grill has serious cold and hot zones. NOT what I expected at this price. I\u2019m constantly moving items from back to front to center. I thought it was caused by wind but ruled that out after blocking the grill from any wind. The flame appears to be consistent along the flame tubes but the heat is totally inconsistent. Won\u2019t buy another one.",

                "reviewText": "This is for the propane version.It gets up to max temperature (550+ degrees F) in about 5 minutes.Assembly was fairly easy as the grill part is assembled except for putting in the heat shields, flame tamers, and cooking grids. The bottom part requires some simple assembly. In all, it took about 2 1/2 hours to assemble. It does require two people as the grill assemble weighs about 140 lbs.As far as grilling, it did fine with to nice porterhouse steaks. It is hotter than my previous grill, so I had to learn to turn the temp down after getting the grill marks on the meat.I also bought the griddle accessory which takes up half of the cooking area. It is a great addition as we use it to grill fish and vegetables.I am happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I asked a friend of mine, who loves to research before purchasing big ticket items, to find me a grill. This is the one he recommended. He was spot on! This grill is amazing. However, if you are used to cooking on a grill that barely gets hot on high...use caution. This grill gets very hot on high! I have not found any spot on the grill where it does not cook evenly, except perhaps an inch from the edges. The drip pan is the full length of the grill and very easy to slide out and clean. The grill came with both the infrared burner and rotisserie. I have not tried them yet, but I am looking forward to making a rotisserie chicken soon. I agree with the other reviews, this is the last grill you will ever buy.",

                "reviewText": "This was my mid-life crisis grill so I spent a lot of time researching different brands. For full disclosure I did not purchase the grill from Amazon but rather from a local dealer.My last grill was a Weber and it lasted 15 years so Weber was my first thought when it was time to be replaced. I considered the Summit S420 and the S470 but after doing my research and looking them over at Home Depot I ruled out Weber because IMHO their quality has suffered the last 15 years. For example they're now using a lower grade of stainless steel and the interior frame of their cart is painted steel. It's painted the same color as stainless steel which I found a little deceptive and when others have questioned them about the specifics of where/how they use stainless steel the company's answers were evasive.Now, for my thoughts on the Bull Angus cart:First of all this the strong points for this grill are that it's incredibly sturdy and cooks very well. It doesn't have lots of frills like light-up propane gauges and dials. I wasn't too interested in frills because they break or quit working.The shipment arrives in 2 boxes both of which are heavy so you'd need help/dolly when moving them around, one box contains the cart the other the grill. They were both very well packaged both the cart and the grill had styrofoam inserts and were wrapped in a thin foam liner as a protectant. They also used steel brackets to brace the edges.As I assembled the grill I kept looking for the ways that I thought that they saved money during the manufacturing process and honestly I was impressed. The nut/bolts that they use are large and all stainless steel, welds are smooth, even the wheels are high quality. Everything in the cart is stainless steel except for the door handles and towel holders. Those are chrome plated something. The cast stainless steel burners are incredible, they weigh about 7 pounds each and the 20 year warranty on them could easy be a lifetime and you'd probably never file a claim. I took a flashlight to see how thick parts of the burners were, thinking that they would save money by making them thin in places. I didn't break out my micrometer but everyhere seemed to be at least 1/8th of an inch, hence the overall weight. The flame tamers and bottom covers appear to be about 1/16 of an inch. If I get ambitious I'll use the micrometer and post back specifics.The grates are solid SS and heavy.The interior lights are just bright enough to cook by, you won't be reading by them but they'll serve their purpose. The transformer is heavy duty and should last a lifetime.The knobs are big and the grill lights easily.I cooked hamburgers as the first meal and found that the grill cooks evenly to within about an inch of each of the edges. It does cook hot so this grill is probably not for low & slow foods like ribs/butts, but those are best over charcoal anyway. The fact that it gets hot quick is an advantage both in being ready to cook faster and waiting for it to heat up after cooking to burn off the gunk. I don't know how many times I forgot what I was doing and left the old Weber going for too long. I have not tried the rotisserie but I did fire up it's burner and it appears that it will do the job. Another cool thing is that since the cover is double-lined it does not get super hot while your cooking.Clean up is fairly easy (for a grill), grease and other droppings fall through to a shallow/wide pan under the bottom covers. The catch pan is easy to remove but washing it is a little more difficult because it is wide and doesn't fit our sink very well, don't even think about getting it into a dishwasher (which would be bad for it anyway). The burners, the flame tamers, and the bottom covers are very easy to remove and re-install but I have not removed them for cleaning yet, just hit them with a steel brush to get the gunk off. If you do that first then all the mess is in the catch pan.Overall, I've very happy with my purchase and I figure it's the last grill I will ever buy and it will probably be in my will.",
