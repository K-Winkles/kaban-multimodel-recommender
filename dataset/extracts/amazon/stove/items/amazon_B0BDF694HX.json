                "reviewText": "This product performs pretty much as I expected and I am pleased with it's performance. I heat my house with wood and have some experience with wood fire. Some say it burns to much wood to quickly. The design of this product with bottom forced air is what causes the hot flame that we enjoy watching. It also causes the wood to burn faster. This I kind of expected and have no issues with it since I harvest my own firewood and kindling. I can generate a nice fire for about 30 minutes with about 6 pieces of hardwood, using small branches for kindling. My only issue is I believe it to be a little pricey and I would not want to have to buy wood. For me it is a relaxing little fire that goes well with a Bourbon while sitting on the front porch.",

The next, the fire was out and there were huge plumes of smoke that were making my husband, our 1 year old, and I cough a lot. We did everything right too (my husband is a former Marine and an engineer-he does everything by the book) so it was shocking when this happened abruptly. I\u2019ll update this after a third burn (another one with pellets and one with wood). The one really good thing is that it doesn\u2019t get hot on the bottom and our table remained cool to the touch. The stainless steel also matches our big outdoor heater and Weber grill.",
