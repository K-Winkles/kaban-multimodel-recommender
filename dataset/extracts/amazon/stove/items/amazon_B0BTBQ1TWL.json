The drawstring really helps secure the cover.The only thing I am not sure about is that I was expecting more of a canvas-like texture. The material the cover is made out of is more like a heavy plastic. That may be good as I think it will be better for protecting the fire pit from rain and snow. It's nice, just a bit of a surprise.",

I would suggest the matching stainless-steel cover, so you can keep rain out of the unit as you let it cool. Then I would highly recommend a water-proof cover like the one I bought. I was going to buy the one that let everyone know I had a Solo Stove firepit, but this one is just as good, and fits perfectly for almost half the price. Depending on what you are sitting your firepit on... you may want to also get the bottom ring to get it off the ground or wood patio. I have a cement patio and I didn't want to take the chance that the heat would crack my patio.",
