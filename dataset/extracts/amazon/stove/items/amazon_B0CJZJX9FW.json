                "reviewText": "After a recent \u201caccident\u201d this became a must.After replacing the hob (with knobs) with a touch activated hob I came home one day with a lot of shopping. I placed the items across the work surface and as there was so much I placed some on the new hob.However, I had inadvertently switch the hob on as it is not a rotary knob now but a touch sensitive sensor. By the time I had come back from the car I could smell oranges for some strange reason and see smoke.I then realised that the hob was know on and cooking the fruit I had placed on it.A few charred oranges later things were under control, but it could have been worse.If I had had one of these electric hob covers at the time this would never have happened as the touch button would be inaccessible with it on. C\u2019est la vie.Anyway now I have the perfect solution which protects the hob from my careless actions.Another nice feature of this is that once you are cooking you can use it as a heat resistant table mat or to use to reduce slip or noise when on the normal kitchen work surface when undertaking cooking tasks.Apparently it can also be used as a mini ironing board (whilst it is sitting on the hob)\u2026They do indicate that you can use it for direct food prep but I think sharp knives would make mincemeat of this so I would not go down that route if I were you.All-in-all a good product that and protects you hob and also increases the work space (safely)",

                "reviewText": "There is a picture of a woman cutting an apple with a huge knife on this mat. I wouldn't recommend that unless you want to ruin the mat!I am confused - the title says 'fireproof' yet it says to ensure you let the stove cool down before placing it on top... so which is it? Seems muddled. Why describe it as 'fireproof'?Anyway, I might use it in the middle of the dining table when I bring hot dishes in, to stop the wood being marked. I won't be cutting up fruit on it that is for sure! None of the photos get up close so you can see the material/texture, so I have taken photos. The back is non-slip rubberised, the front is a bit like a mouse mat, in fact it looks and feels like my big mouse mat, just black. It smells unpleasant, hoping that will disappear now it is out of the box it came in.If you have a large hob and want to create more work space then this can be put on top of the glass (cold) hob and it becomes a free surface, then you can either hang it up, or roll it up. However, it is black, I wish it was a nice pattern or at least a cheerful colour. It is useful, but I think the simple fact that it is black is going to put me off. I have a fabulous large mouse mat, with a vivid print on it, maybe they could come up with a whole load of different designs or even put jokes on them, like, 'the dishes are looking at me dirty again'.... that kinda thing, black is just so boring.\u00a314 at time of this review.",

                "reviewText": "I quite like Linda\u2019s essentials electric stove top cover, it is fairly thick, it has a non slip coating on the underside and it has a nice smooth surface on the top side. Lengthwise it is longer than my hob, which is good because I can cover the control knobs and widthwise it is marginally wider, but because it doesn\u2019t slide around, that isn\u2019t a problem.My hob has small channels around the edges where food particles can collect over time and it is difficult getting them out, so this mat will stop that problem and hopefully provide some protection for the hob as well, especially since the hob is the best place for my air fryer at the moment.The mat is quite heavy, so I will probably not use the hooks to hang it up, I will probably just roll it up and stick it in a drawer when I need to use the hob. The vertical space between the hob and the extractor fan in our kitchen isn\u2019t wide enough to hang the mat there fortunately, I would not like having something that could possibly fall off the wall onto the hob, because the heat from the hob has weakened the glue on the hooks.Due to the high quality of the mat, it can be used for other things as well, such as protecting the dining table if you need to put hot pans on it, for instance when you have assemble your own type meals (i.e. Fajitas), it could be used as an ironing mat as well.",

                "reviewText": "I expected this to be like most protective mats for cookers in that you can use it to protect the surface while cooking - at least for an induction hob, which is what I have. I probably should have read the blurb more carefully because, although this cover is heatproof, it states on the box that it should not be used while the cooker is actually on and, indeed, you should let the glass surface cool. The mat is 72 x 52cm which is just about the size of a large sized induction or ceramic hob. It comes with two hooks, the idea being that you hang it on the wall at the back of the stove top - which will also then catch any splashes from your cooking - and put it down on the glass stove top when you have finished, thus giving you more worktop space. The mat is washable/wipeable but is quite soft textured so you certainly should not use it as a cutting surface in any way. Useful to put warm pans, using it as a large table mat. You could use it as an ironing mat or just a surface protector for any table or worktop. You can hang it up, roll it or fold it to stow it away. It's going to be quite useful but it isn't entirely what I thought it was.",

                "reviewText": "First off, I mainly ordered this for its ability to use as an ironing mat. I'll come to that later. As a stove top cover, this would be perfect it is plenty thick enough that it has a bit of weight to it. This does not slip and stays firmly in place (fair warning, when taken out of the packet, this does smell of rubber, but it does pass). It comes with two hooks so can be used as a backslash protector. It is not oilstain resistant, the oil doss soak in a little bit so don't assume that it doesn't need a wipe down, give it a wipedown after every use.As an iron mat this perfect for small items. It sits on the table top and carpet perfectly without slipping. I found it perfect for ironing down material when sewing. It's can the perfect addition for travelling as well if need to do some ironing whilst on holiday.I'd recommend it to others.",
