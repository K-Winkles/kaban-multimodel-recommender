A simple lesson on consequences for taking them off should fix that right up! It was the best option for me,I don\u2019t have full time little ones in the house. They do sell things that cover the whole entire burner,but they are very bulky and in many cases would cover up the dial numbers as well. Just something to think about before you decide. Hope this helps",
