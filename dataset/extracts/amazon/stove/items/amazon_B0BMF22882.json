                "reviewText": "I bought these because the description said it fits RV Magic Chef stoves, among others. I have a 30 year old RV with the original Magic Chef gas range. These grommets are NOT the correct size for older stoves. They're too small in diameter, both the hole for the grate and the diameter for the stove top hole. They will somewhat work because the grate stretches out the grommet, but rarely hold in place when removing the grates to clean the stove top. Or if they do stay in place, the grommet gets pushed through the stove top hole when trying to insert the grate after cleaning the stove top. I have replaced these before with no issues like this, but I tried this brand this time and these are NOT a good fit. Sometimes cheaper isn't better at all!! Just a heads up to everyone that has an older RV like me.",
