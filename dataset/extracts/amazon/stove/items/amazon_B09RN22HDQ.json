The stove itself is of sturdy construction. Small propane canisters can be purchased from Home Depot for a good price. Will eventually get the 20 lb and the attachment for refills (both at Home Depot as well). There is no waste or gas residue when using except when you disconnect the fuel canister, there might be a little bit of a leak as you do that. But it's completely practical to use this inside the house on an appropriate counter or stovetop with ventilation.",

The stove proved I don\u2019t need max flame to cook. It seems efficient, so gas use seemed less with this stove.Seems well constructed, easy to clean, a win. Achieved the goal to reduce the use of space with a good quality stove. Would recommend buying the windscreen, it fits nicely in the stoves case and does it\u2019s job in windy conditions",

                "reviewText": "Took it on a two day camping trip and it worked out well. Light weight, lights easy, heats well. Overall I\u2019m happy with it. Case is a little cheesy but I\u2019m sure it will last and be fine. I don\u2019t toss my stuff around too hard so it should last a while. Used it with a Lodge griddle/grill and it worked great. For the cost I\u2019d say it\u2019s a keeper! I also have a 10k btu gas one stove and the built in wind screen on this one seems to help. Had some wind and no flame out so that\u2019s a plus. I\u2019ll pick up a folding wind screen just to have it. Appears well made and should last a while. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy another.",
