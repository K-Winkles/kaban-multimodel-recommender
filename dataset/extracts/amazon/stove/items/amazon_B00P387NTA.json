I contacted the mfr as all I wanted was some factory touch-up paint since the stove worked perfectly. The mfr referred me to Amazon who gave me a credit which was more than what the touch-up paint will cost. Then I got another message from the mfr that they want to send me a new replacement cooktop panel which I thought was more than generous. Even though the stove arrived damaged, it wasn't the fault of the mfr or Amazon. The stove itself is wonderful, and I'm happy with how the mfr and Amazon handled the situation.",
