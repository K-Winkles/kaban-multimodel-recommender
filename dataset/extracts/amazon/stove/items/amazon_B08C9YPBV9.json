Luckily mine was great and didn't have any of the issues (leaking, peeling paint, etc). However, I do have issues with the knobs as they are hard to turn counter-clockwise, they are NOT like the knob of regular kitchen stove-top knob where you can turn easily. (or maybe I'm supposed to press in then turn, I have to verify that.) I just feel like one day the plastic knob is going to break. Until then Mr. Plier will always be a reach away.As for the burner, it burns high, and boils water/cook quicker than the inside burner (very old). Food now tasted like they're being cooked.",

                "reviewText": "I would give this 0 stars if I could. I bought this specifically for canning. I have canned on other camping stoves previously, but wanted one that wasn't so old. It was easy to assemble and sturdy enough, although fairly cheap looking. However, from the first time it was turned on to use it had an extremely loud hissing type sound, as if it was putting off excessive amounts of heat at the burner. We triple checked that the regulator and hose were correctly assembled. The noise continued, but we used it to can anyways, figuring it was just loud. I canned a total of 4 hours over a couple weeks and it completely drained my new propane tank. I never turned it on more than the lowest setting and it still heated up crazy fast. I made sure to close the valves and shut off the stove after each use. Obviously it has a flaw somewhere or leak because my propane should NOT have drained after only 4 hours on the lowest setting. I also did not like the paint smell during the first use, or the paint that peeled on the outside of the wind guards because of the dangerously high heat put off when on the lowest setting. I would be scared to try this on the high settings. Unfortunately I bought this during the summer, but didn't start canning until the fall, so it is too late for me to return. This is useless to me. I wish I could get a refund, and I will be sure to steer any family and friends away from buying this camping stove.",

Really disappointed, I have 2 Coleman stoves that never have done anything like this. The burners are either 100%-10% very little adjustment. OVERPRICED JUNK. This is now at my work in the scrap metal pile. BUYER BEWARE, fire hazard. There's a reason they don't accept returns.",
