                "reviewText": "We've used this every day for the past few months. It boils water faster than our microwave, and much faster than our gas stove. We use a round cast iron skillet for pancakes, a camping stainless steel cup for individual water heating (even though it's not super magnetic- it still works with induction), a regular size pressure cooker, and a very large 22qt stock pot for most of our cooking. So far the unit works great and heats quickly and efficiently. It hums and has a fan when it's on, but is quieter than our microwave. One of the larger skillets or pots got off center once and the plastic melted slightly on the side, but the damage was barely visible and didn't affect the function. On the lower settings the unit will switch on and off periodically to adjust the temperature. This works fine with thicker pans, but with thin pans frying items cycle repeatedly between a strong sizzle then stop- it would be nice if it had a more constant lower power setting. Overall we are very happy with having an induction heater for much less than a full stove. Controls are easy to use once you learn which buttons mean what. One setting stays on longer than the other, and the +/- allows adjustment of the temp. Easy to clean.",

                "reviewText": "This was a great purchase and a good bargain. Had it 10 months so far with no issues. At home we use it instead of the gas stove for quick boiling and cooking without fumes, with no need to run the exhaust fan. We also took it on a cross country RV trip this summer (very portable) and used it whenever we had electric hookups (cooks faster than the propane stove). It seems to draw less current than regular electric cooktops as it uses electromagnets instead of just a heat coil; it never overloaded a circuit yet in our old house or in the RV. After use it cools down quickly and can be put away in about a minute after the fan turns off. The glass top is easy to clean, and the controls are easy to use. It obviously does only work with induction-compatible pans (if a magnet sticks to the pan bottom it should work), but most of the pans I already had were compatible. Works best when the pan bottom fits within the circles as that's where the heat is generated.",

                "reviewText": "Our kitchen was being remodeled last summer and we needed a substitute for our range. What I love about this is it is very safe. Any pan you have that a magnet will stick to works on this plate. Even though it\u2019s black, the display is large and well lit. I even used it to boil water in my bedroom when I had Covid and was congested bevause my humidifier always gets the floor wet. This does nothing of the kind. It doesn\u2019t heat up the tabletop nor the floor. It\u2019s very well made. If you want to cook outside because you\u2019re frying I think it\u2019s great for that too. And it fits in a drawer.",

                "reviewText": "Update on Oct 29, 2023: I contacted the manufacturer\u2019s customer support and after 4 emails back and forth on the same day they initiated a replacement of the product. It arrived in 3 days and I\u2019ve used if 3 or 4 times since.It works well, I like that it heats up very quickly, much quicker than the gas stovetop. One downside is it has limited temperature controls, but I\u2019ve learnt how to manage them.Initial review: I used it probably 8 times, 15-20 minutes each time and then it died. It started to smell like burnt electronic circuitry and stopped working.",

                "reviewText": "This unit was larger but nicer than expected. It looks really clean with its design, works incredibly well and seems to be energy efficient. We don't have many pots and pans to use with it but wanted to test the induction system prior to buying a stove; highly recommend people do that as the learning curve is there for induction! Water boils fast, the safety features work perfectly and the unit is great. Nice unit especially for the price!",

                "reviewText": "I use an 11 in cast iron skillet and was hoping this would work for frying bacon or fish outside on my patio to keep from smelling up my house and splattering up my kitchen. Unfortunately the hot spot on this is only about 6-7 inches, so things in the middle burn and stuff around the edges does not cook, even on cast iron. A strip o0f bacon will burn in the middle and the ends will still be undercooked. Furthermore, the hot skillet extends dangerously close to the plastic control panel causing some discoloration and a crack on the corner. I'm going to start looking for a larger one that will have a larger hot spot. That said, it has been over a year that I have been using this and it has held up.",
