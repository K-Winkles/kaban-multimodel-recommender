This cooktop unit is great for me. It heats up fast and does not heat the room. Easy to cook on with dialing temp control. It uses all pan types. Takes a bit to cool down of course. Like this unit.",

                "reviewText": "I like the overall look and maybe because I\u2019m used to cooking with gas this seems to take forever to heat up. I don\u2019t like that you can\u2019t visibly see if a burner is on. The old coil ones you could see they were red when in use. These are just black round discs that sort of look like rubber. Idk if other ( new versions) hot plates have burners that change color when in use or not but I would recommend the manufacturer include this feature in its design. Or even a light next to the burner in use. Other than that it looks nice and works well if your use to electric.",

I would have given another star if both burners functioned equally but the smaller burner does not cook as hot as the larger. Great for warming or something along those lines but not great to say prepare pasta while making sauce on the larger burner. It does however give an added dimension to meals I can prepare in my small space.",
