This item here is magnetic and sticks to her stove and with the lip to the front, nothing can fall onto the stove and with the small \u201cwall\u201d or \u201clip\u201d on the back, nothing can fall behind the stove again. Everyone who has came into the house has commented on it. I think even my sister has bought one and I plan on getting myself one. Too bad I can\u2019t get commission for helping to sell more. Lol",
