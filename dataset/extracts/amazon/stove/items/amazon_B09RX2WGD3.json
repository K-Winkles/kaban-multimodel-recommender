                "reviewText": "My glass cooktop recently died and a new one of the right size is on backorder! So I needed a solution that could allow me to cook for my family for the next month without breaking the bank (I just paid for a new cooktop so I didn't want to spend too much). I have been pleasantly surprised by this little unit. For the price, it's awesome.What I love the most: price is great! It does work well - I have used it for just over a week and cooked dinner on it every night. I've boiled corn in a large pot without a problem, cooked up hamburger and chicken, made rice - just about everything. It definitely gets hot enough to boil and fry things. It's also easy to wipe down/clean.What I didn't love: The two burner pieces are close together and so you can for sure use two medium size pans at the same time, but you would struggle to use a large pan and another pan at the same time. Often I have to cook one thing, then the other - or I have to do smaller portions and use small/med size pans. Not a big deal, really.I noticed reviews spoke about the light going off. It's good to know it goes ON when it is heating and OFF once it reaches temp - so don't think the unit is turning off just because the light goes off. It just means it is at that set temperature.OVERALL: A fantastic solution for my problem and 100% worth the reasonable price. I plan to gift it to one of my adult children who lives in a small apartment once I am done - it's great for that situation, too.",

                "reviewText": "Our stove/oven died recently and I decided until we can buy a new one that a double burner hot plate just might suit our needs. I am so glad I bought this for my kitchen. The burners could be spaced further apart as others have mentioned but I am able to use my large skillet and a small pot/skillet at the same time. I have no problem boiling water and frying foods. The temperature setting gets plenty hot for me. I do a lot of from scratch cooking. I am a bit clumsy and uncoordinated so I have to be careful because it\u2019s easy to knock your pot/pan off these burners. Also if the bottom of your pots/pans are warped in any way and not flat on the bottom you will have issues keeping them on these burners, in my opinion. So just be aware of that. This product is very easy to keep clean and is lightweight. Making it very easy to move.I place mine on a heat resistant mat while in use just for safety because the entire thing does get hot. Highly recommend you do the same.",

                "reviewText": "I personally used the portable burner for a hotpot and it worked just fine. It is very standard and gets the job done.Features: The burner part is a standard spiral, the knob goes from: OFF, 1-5, and MAX, and the there is the small light that indicates I\u2019d the burner is off or on.Likes: It was cheaper compared to all the other ones and gets the job done with no issues.Dislike: Not much, only complaint I had was the cord is pretty short, so expect to use an extension cord if you plan to have it in the middle of the table.Overall would recommend if you need a cheap burner for smaller events or just to cook one thing.",

I find it really no different than a stove other than it is a bit slower to boil but not that much to complain. I just put a lid on the pot and it boils a little faster.
