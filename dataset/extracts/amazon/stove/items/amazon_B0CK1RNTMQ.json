I also didn't want to sacrifice appearance and quality. I came across this one which balanced the need for a great price and quality. It arrived undamaged. There was a minor spot that I feel that could've had a little more stain but it's not enough to dock off stars or make a huge fuss over. The handles on the board I may replace in the future because they are a little thin and I was looking at a different style to match my preference, but the board itself is solid. I like the ability to place the little pad protectors underneath to help prevent sliding. I purchased the board to go on our new flat-top range. This serves the purpose of protecting the glass top and provides me a little extra space while making the kitchen look classier. Don't hesitate to purchase this board if you want something simple and functional.",

I started looking for alternatives to cover the rangetop, while not in use. There are many choices, ranging from silicone, to wood, to stone. We chose this rangetop cover based on several things: looks (it is beautiful), durability (acacia hardwood) and adaptability. It looks beautiful sitting on the rangetop. It can be used as a cutting board. It can be used as a charcuterie board. It also fits the sink top. The handles make it easily portable. This was a great find at a great price!",

Easy to lift on and off for stove top use, but you do need a handy place to put it while cooking. Bought one for us and one of our daughters and we both are impressed with usefulness. Can also be used as large serving tray for larger gatherings.",

The order came quickly and I actually bought 2, one for me and one for my daughter\u2019s stove top. Both pictured with my review. I would absolutely order from them again or recommend them.",
