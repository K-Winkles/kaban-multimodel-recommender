Fire department had to be called it was a whole thing! Purchased these right away and they are easy to install, they do get kinda warm if oven is on and your using stovetop and they are hanging. Be careful not to close in oven when using stovetop and oven.",

                "reviewText": "We have an LG electric stove with the knobs acrross the front. The knobs turn very easily and after one got bumped and started a fire, we started searching for something to prevent this from happening again. We tried many different styles and brands before we found these. These little inserts work great. They keep the knobs from being turned accidentally but allow us to use the stove without removing anything and without being an eye sore. I highly recommend this product.",

They are also very annoying in that when you're using a burner, they hang down into the oven door area. So they catch in the oven door when you're opening and closing it. Other than that, they do keep from accidentally knocking the knobs on. I wish there was one more in the set for my oven temperature knob, because I keep hitting that and turning it on.",
