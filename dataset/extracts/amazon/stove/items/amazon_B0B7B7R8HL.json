Cool air comes in the bottom vents to feed the fire and enters between the two layers of stainless steel to be heated up. Having cool air come in the bottom vents allows the fire to always plenty of oxygen. Since more oxygen can reach the fuel source, fire wood is burned more efficiently than traditional fire pits. The air that enters the double wall warms up and is pushed out over the fire. This creates a second burn that burns off the small particles of wood that would have been smoke.",

It doesn't take much kindling to get it going and it throws a lot of heat. You should be aware that you need smaller firewood for it. It also tends to stop working after about 2 hours when the aeration holes in the bottom fill with ash. Cleaning up is easy since it reduces your wood to very fine ash. Make sure you get a long neck lighter to get it started.",

For years it led to frustration and discouragement whenever we tried to get a fire started. We had a fire within minutes with this product and the fire got big. This size is perfect and has a lot more room than I originally thought. My husband can't handle smoke smells and this truly is smokeless!! So happy my husband can enjoy the fore with us now. This is worth every penny. I am so excited our family can have a lovely campfire and experience this together now, with ease!! We had some fire starters and a little plain mulch kindling at the bottom and then put the logs on after the kindling got going a little bit. So effortless!!",

                "reviewText": "I've always been wanting to get a fire pit for my yard one I've got a bunch of old water damaged wood flooring that came with the house stored in the garage, this woods probably from 1940 since the house was made in 1930. Super easy to light just used some paper and cardboard no starter fluid and some small sticks to get it going once it starts up there's no smoke or hardly any at all. The way that it projects straight up it's almost as if the secondary burn creates a vortex or upwards pressure that keeps the smoke if any up high and out of any faces or people. One of the photos are if the bottom of the removable ash pan it turns a nice burnt titanium like color and some other parts of the stove turn this great color as well. Amazingly painless clean up pull out the pan (where gloves to not get soot on you) dump the ashes responsibly i through them in my shrubs to help them grow. Pull out the actual ash pan dump and then flip the stove upsidedown to get any remaining out. Then put it in the storage bag and store it either in the garage or somewhere else. I did purchase an off brand grill top / stand that works really well for cooking and keeping it off the ground. All in all it should be 6 stars for the memories created the ease of use and just overall very well built product for the price worth every penny!!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I still think this is one of the best fire pits on the market. However, you need to constantly have the right amount of heat and wood or it becomes just another nice looking fire pit.One truth we continue to struggle with is how to let the fire die down without being very smokey. Our first couple fires we followed the directions and then let the fire burn out by itself. This causes tremendous smoke that is quite embarrassing after telling neighbors and friends that you have a low smoke fire pit. It smokes more than our prior $30 fire pit because we could at least spread out ambers and it would die quickly, but the solo allows great airflow which allows embers to continue to smolder for an hour or more. Again, not enough heat and not enough (or too much) wood and the solo smokes like anything else.Luckily, there is a serviceable solution, but of course it costs additional money. We went with a commercial 16\u201d pizza pan which really helps. I hear solo\u2019s lid is even better, but is 6x as expensive. So if you buy this, a high temp tolerant lid of some sort is a necessity. 4/5 stars, as a lid should be included so you don\u2019t have a long smokey ending to your \u201c low smoke\u201d pit fire.",
