                "reviewText": "Finally !!!.....someone was smart enough to add a propane adaptor to these type stoves. Sometimes, I go camping or prospecting and have to bring the propane setup for colder weather, but it sits taller and a little unstable. I like using the Gas One model, because it has a stable platform, but, the butane doesn't work well in colder weather. Nice to be able to attach the hose, and use propane...Thanks to whoever improved upon this...Update 12/5/23. When disconnecting the propane from the stove, make sure you do it from the tank end of the hose. The propane bottle has a shut off valve that closes when you unscrew the bottle. If you try to unscrew it at the stove end, gas will leak out because there is no shut off valve at that end.Also, when moving the stove about to either change the bottle, or place it elsewhere, make sure to re-check the fitting at the stove end, and re-tighten if needed, as it comes loose a little when you move it around.",

I have not tried propane but feel sure it's going to be a winner. Nice blue flame with the butane. I also got a hose to attach this unit to a 20lb propane tank. I also have a few 1lb cans of propane. I didn't \"USE\" the product. I only tested it to be sure it would work.The case it came in was a creme color probably called white. Rather thin and the latches are rather flimsy but adequate.I'm quite sure this thing will perform as it's advertised. Flame on the very first attempt.All in all... exactly what I wanted...",

                "reviewText": "Butane cans are impossible to find around my area, so I use only the propane feature.. (Plus propane is wayy cheaper).. and my experience has been nothing but positive. I use it as my main gas cooker in my apartment. They warn you to only use it in well ventilated areas... but that's just lawsuit prevention..The materials its made of seem no more or less flimsy than others I have owned.. They are all made to be light-weight and portable for camping and whatnot. The hose is long enough to not be a nuisance, and easily connect to a 1lb propane cylinder standing upright. The hose connections fit tight and do not leak (I'm a licensed plumber, so i know all about gas leaks)..The flame adjustment is actually better than some others that cost more. You can adjust it easily from full boil to barely a simmer, and it stays where you put it. (I have owned ones that didn't)Everything arrived un-damaged.. I'll never use the plastic case, so I cannot attest to it's durability, but I suspect it is as fragile as all the rest on the market.Overall, for the price, you really can't do better for a dual-fuel burner... I'm likely going to buy another.UPDATE: 3 months later and I'm still using it every single day.. My local Walmart finally got some butane cans in stock, so I've been using those lateley (they seem to burn hotter). This burner is performing FLAWLESSLY... You can seriously stop shopping around now... Buy this one!",

                "reviewText": "I received my camping stove the day I left for a 2 month camping/roadtrip. The box was smashed, wasn't expecting the product itself to also be damaged & did not find out until after my 4 hr drive to my destination and I was completely unpacked & setup. Dinner time rolls around & I opened up the box to find the case & camp stove crushed/bent completely on one corner. The door that opens for the cylinder barely hanging on & the cylinder unable to fit in the chamber. I not only was unable to use my camp stove , but unable to make a return for a new one within the 30 days because I was out in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the forest 2-1/2 hrs from a town, with no service/internet.I was NOT about to drive to the nearest town just to make a complaint/return so I waited until I needed supplies 3 weeks later, did the formalities with explanation and pictures, but was denied & told I could not do a return.So I'm stuck with a broken unusable camp stove. \ud83d\udc4d\u2714\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "Needed a butane/propane camp stove and decided to try this apparently new, unrated product. Have a butane-only stove of the same design for about 25 years that worked so well inside and outside that I wanted to try the added propane option for times when butane is unavailable. Propane tanks are always around, whether smaller 1lb or the larger 20lb type (use a downsizing hose adapter, e.g. GasOne 50143-08 16.4 oz to 20 lb Tank QCC1/ Type 1, 4-12ft) so this model serves as most versatile for outdoor use. In a crunch it will work inside at home too (with good ventilation ONLY, to prevent CO poisoning) and a good backup for emergencies. Happy to have gotten this stove, though have as yet not used propane. The plastic carry case is a bit flimsy but its contents are not heavy and it serves to neatly pack the stove away. The only precaution--when new, open and air outside because burner and/or case offgas volatile organics that may not be pleasant. Wind shielding is also not included, so that would be a plus, if included.",

But with the proper hose, everything works fine.",
