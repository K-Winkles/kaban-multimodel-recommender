                "reviewText": "This product fits well and looks nice. I don't use the glass top on my stove very often because using it for anything causes it to scratch and develop a gray discoloration on one burner. Don't know what that is from. Bought in 2021 and have had it covered a lot of the time. Also purchased pots made for glass but the cover is best. Since the glass top needs to remain covered, at least I can use the top as more counter space This product is perfect for additional counter space",

Size fits perfectly, looks nice, neutral gray color and easy to clean. I was a little sceptical, so I turned on the stove for about two minutes to check out how durable it was. Passed the smoke test! It buckled a little bit but returned to normal after it cooled. Many old folks, like me, drop stuff all the time. This helps a whole bunch. Absolutely worth it.",

Although, in time, I think I might because the feet will make it easier to move the piece as it goes on and off my stove. It\u2019s a beautiful piece of wood. There are many stove top covers out there, with many different price points. Maybe I\u2019ll get fancier in the future, but this piece is pretty, functional, and I\u2019m thrilled with it!!
