Cool air comes in the bottom vents to feed the fire and enters between the two layers of stainless steel to be heated up. Having cool air come in the bottom vents allows the fire to always plenty of oxygen. Since more oxygen can reach the fuel source, fire wood is burned more efficiently than traditional fire pits. The air that enters the double wall warms up and is pushed out over the fire. This creates a second burn that burns off the small particles of wood that would have been smoke.",

I ordered it for short term rental guests and it came late so it arrived the night before the guests arrived. I could not return it because the guest wanted to use it. I should have returned it and bought it at a local store.",

Why would you not make the ash pan accessible?Also the stove was designed to incorporate all of these ridiculously overpriced add-ons , namely the lid and heat diverter, which is necessary because all the heat goes straight up.Never would have purchased it for myself but I\u2019m glad the kids did, it does work great otherwise.",

                "reviewText": "I like the 2.0 stove because it is large enough to accommodate standard fire log lengths. Access to the spacious interior makes lighting a breeze. After the embers are formed and the main logs start to burn, the stove produces very little visible smoke or burning ashes escaping into the atmosphere. The stove produces an amazing amount of heat that radiates in every direction. Clean-up is easy and the weight of the stove allows for effortless transport to other locations. I recommend buying a cover if the stove is kept outside since it will fill with water if left in the rain.",
