When you use it for the first time, the protective silicone oil on the outer layer of the item breaks down at high temperatures, and produces a little smoke. After it is fully burned there will be no more smoke. 8 About the size There are 4 burners in the package, 2 are 6 inches and 2 are 8 inches, if your old burner size doesn't match this, please don't buy it, even if your model is listed. 9 I bought a black one, why did I receive a green one?
