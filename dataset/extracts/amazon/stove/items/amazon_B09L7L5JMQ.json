                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Works great but beware: This is not preset for hardwiring",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The first thing buyers should be aware of, which is NOT listed anywhere I could see in the listing, is that the unit has a three prong plug. If you're building your kitchen from scratch, wiring is easier because of the location choices of hikes in the wall.Otherwise, if you're like me, and replacing your hood unit, I would have liked for the company to note whether it was bare wire or plugged. The reason being, if there's something wrong after install, and you need to send it back for replacement, they might refuse if you have cut the plug off. That said:If you're not comfortable with bare wiring/electricity, get a handyman to do this for you. I'm not an electrician, but don't mind dabbling. It's actually extremely easy to do. Here are the steps:1. I made sure to plug it in and test the fan modes and lighting before snipping the three prong plug off.2. Turn off the breaker to the oven hood in your electrical switch box. DO NOT SKIP THIS PART OR YOU CAN DIE.3. Now that you're safe to work, cut the three prong plug off of the power cable. Take a razor and slice the black shielding. About 2 inches long. This will expose 3 separate wires. They will be black, white and green.4. The BLACK wire is the \"HOT\" or \"live\" wire. Green is ground and white is neutral, which takes any unused electricity back to the circuit box. These colors will match up to the wires coming out of your wall.Basically, strip each wire so you have about an inch worth of copper, twist said copper so that it is all taught and not frayed. Then match the like colors and wrap the copper wire you just twisted, around the thick bare wire from the wall.5. Put electrical tape around the wound wires, but not too much. About 3 wrap arounds. Put a wire cap on the joined and taped wires and twist the cap on until it is snug. Repeat for the other two.6. Put excess power cable back in the wall.Done. Pretty much. Mine is ductless, and I chose to use the top screw holes rather than the back facing ones because I didn't want to drill into my tile. My previous unit was screwed to the top, so I knew that the same screws were just the right size.If you do want to drill into tile, make sure to have the proper drill bit type. Probably carbide. (Masonry)I did have my wife hold the unit up for me until I was able to get 2 screws in to where I marked the holes with a pencil and drilled a pilot hole, and highly advise you also get someone to give you a hand as well. Just a PITA otherwise.Works great. Lights are bright, fan isn't crazy loud and looks great.I would maybe take half a star off for the fact that there's no information about the wiring, but I'm not even sure if that's fair considering it's not necessarily in terms of product usage, useful. As far as usage goes five stars so far.",

The charcoal filter that is recommended to use with ventless hood does not come with it so you have to buy separately but is easy to install. It is a slim hood if you need more clearance.
