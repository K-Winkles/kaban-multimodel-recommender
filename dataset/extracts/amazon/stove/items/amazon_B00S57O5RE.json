                "reviewText": "The product itself is overall decent. I have been using a couple times per month for about a year now, and the stove puts out lots of heat pretty evenly with a good amount of room overall. However, as others have mentioned, the controls are not very exact, and it is difficult to get a low flame out of the stove. What really makes this 5 stars though is the warranty support. I had an issue with a leaky regulator pipe come about in the past few months and needed a replacement. I was able to submit a warranty claim through Coleman's website, and after just a few days with one or two emails for some additional details, I was sent a whole new stove, which was above and beyond just the replacement regulator pipe that I needed. For fast and easy warranty support above and beyond what was needed, they have my endorsement.",

Just got a new one today, hopefully it will last just as long. The old one still works, but it's starting to heat unevenly and it's pretty much impossible to clean now, even though we always put foil on the bottom. Only negative quality issue is that the grate has thin chrome plating and will rust. Wish it had thicker chrome plating. Would pay more for that feature. Overall, it's just a great stove.",
