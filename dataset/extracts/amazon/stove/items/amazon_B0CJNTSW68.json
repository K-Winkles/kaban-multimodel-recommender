                "reviewText": "I bought this because i urgently had to clean my bathtub as it gets dirty super fast and I reccomend this completelythe reason of why I bought the plastic blades and not the metal ones was because I read here that they can scratch the surfaces and that plastic blades were difficult to get, so I believed it and I'm not dissappointed. Also these have 2 sides so it's like getting the double for the same price! (i just compulsively buy) but wtv this is an amazing product, I'm in love.The handle was a bit tiny at first but I used it and it's not uncomfortable, and well also sometimes the blade moved into storage mode but I think it's because I was too rough. I mean it's only 10 dollars and it's made of plastic, if you want something to last longer prob invest in a metal one, but for domestic cleaning I think this is more than enough :]I only know that this works well with soap stains, if you need it for the stove you should prob read other reviews \u2661",

My oven is fairly new so I wanted to keep it in tiptop condition for a long as possible but inevitably there is always some burnt on residue that just will not come off. I also didn\u2019t want to scratch the oven interior so I\u2019ve been careful about what I\u2019ve used to clean it. I read some reviews on another site about these miracle scrapers you can buy, found similar on Amazon at amazing prices and decided to give them a try. What a game changer! I wish I\u2019d known about these years ago, I could have saved myself a lot of time and energy! Within minutes of taking the scraper out of the packaging, I had removed all those annoying residues\u2026.with no effort\u2026.or scratching. It\u2019s easy to change the blades over, they just slide in and out. I plan to use the scraper on my upvc doors where the previous owner has left some sort of sticky backing tape. I\u2019m guessing the scraper will work miracles again.",
