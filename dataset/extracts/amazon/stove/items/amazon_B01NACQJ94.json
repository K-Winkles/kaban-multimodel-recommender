I like the modern slimline look, the two lights in the front are nice and bright and there are 3 fan speeds. Install was easy enough. It did take two people and I would recommend an extension on your drill. It's lightweight, I was able to hold it in place while my husband screwed it in. The hardest part was removing the blue packing film. The filters for the 30\" Slim (CFK3-TM) are not included but in the box is a link to a form for a free filter kit in exchange for a review or you can purchase one on their website. From what I've read, the other filters do not fit so don't order the one off Amazon that is not the right one. So far I am thrilled with my purchase. It's beautiful, functional and affordable.Update: I received my free filters!!",

Under Cabinet Range Hood for my kitchen, and I couldn't be more pleased with its performance and design.First and foremost, the ductless convertible feature is a game-changer. It provides the flexibility to install the range hood without the need for an external duct, making it easy to fit into any kitchen setup. The slim design is perfect for saving space while still effectively removing cooking odors and smoke.The 3-speed exhaust fan is a great addition, allowing me to customize the ventilation based on the cooking activity. Whether it's a quick stir-fry or a slow simmer, this range hood has the power to handle it all.

The materials used feel premium, and the overall build quality is impressive.Installation was straightforward, thanks to the clear instructions provided. The range hood operates quietly, which is a significant plus in a busy kitchen environment.In conclusion, the COSMO COS-5MU30 30 in. Under Cabinet Range Hood has exceeded my expectations.

                "reviewText": "if you have older 12\" deep cabinets, mounting could be tricky because you need nearly 1\" for the power cord. it is feasible to adjust the plastic piece holding the power cord straight but that's a 'better know what you're doing' type issue. power is 44\" long maybe in the factory, after internal routing you get about 35\" (in my case)half an hour or so peeling off blue stuff and under 10 minutes to mount it.As someone looking for as simple an install as possible i scored 100% with this unit. Install was easy, i measured and drilled the holes for the front first, sat the unit on the screws (its lite enough) and quickly mounted the rear pair of screws. The front and rear have the wide holes that narrow so you can slide the hood on and off, i didnt want that and the rear has permanent holes so i used those. i was worried about vibrations and 'keeds' :)It looks nice and clean and i never thought about it but i appreciate the lack of some big stupid logo on the unit. its just the buttons and looks clean. the metal is thin but decent, doesnt bend or ding easily.The leds are nice, good amount of light, i got the 6500k to match my kitchen.The blue stuff wow, I ended up being impressed by how scratch resistant it is. its too bad they couldnt wrap my car in it.fan is good, its what i expected, its not silent but even on low the steam etc from the stove immediately flows up and out. there's a low whine, its low though so fades into the background easily. its there but low and i dont have to adjust my volumes when its on low or medium. I didnt test high, low-med gets me what i need.super happy, totally recommend.",
