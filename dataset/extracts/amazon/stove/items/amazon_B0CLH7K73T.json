                "reviewText": "These are nice size chunks of pine for a tabletop fire pit. The 7 to 8 pound box is a nice size to store and carry (even in an RV). The thing is, what you are really paying for here is the labor in cutting and packaging these 3\"X1\"X.75\" chunks; the convenience. The size is perfect for burning and controlling how much fire you want and for how long you want it. The price? Whew! $36 is definitely not for the faint of heart. For city folk, and for those who only occasionally use their tabletop pit, this is probably fine. For those of us who have access to disposable lumber and a saw, this would be a pass. I will enjoy this box and then get back to searching through the disposable lumber bins at Home Depot (when I am there shopping for other stuff) and cutting my wood myself. I should note, however, that this attractive box of wood would also make a great and unique gift if you are giving someone a tabletop wood-burning fire pit.",

                "reviewText": "You'll still need larger firewood of course but this is great to get things started or even for a quick emergency or creating a small fire for the tabletop/portable firpits!I ordered two different sizes of these firewood blocks, a 3.5 inch box and a 5 inch box. I couldn't really find any information of how many you'd recieve so here is what I got:\u2022 Both boxes (3.5\" and 5\") weight 7-8 lbs\u2022 For the 3.5\" blocks, you will revieve 90 blocks total and 8 firestarters\u2022 For the 5\" blocks, you will revieve 54 blocks total and 8 firestartersDue to them being similar in weight I don't know if you necessarily get more volume choosing one option over the other. However, if you dont need the larger blocks (if you already have good kindlers, firewood, cardboard, etc.) I'd go for the smaller 3.5\" blocks since they'd probably last you longer! The firestarters are easy to take apart too, I dont feel like you'd need the whole roll to get a kindle started so you could probably cut them in half and get double the amount . These wood blocks are super dry and splintery so definitely be careful when handling. Otherwise the value you get from a box like this is in my opinion worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "My recent order of WFLUOLUO Mini Firewood was nothing short of impressive. It arrived as a box of perfectly sized firewood chunks, measuring about 3 to 4 inches in length and roughly an inch square. These kiln-dried pine firewood pieces are ideal for various applications, and I primarily use them for my desktop smoker.One of the standout features of this mini firewood is its exceptional quality. Kiln-dried to perfection, these pine firewood chunks have a moisture content of less than 6%, ensuring they burn efficiently and cleanly. They are bark-free, making them even more convenient to use.I find these mini firewood chunks to be incredibly easy to ignite, and they produce a steady, hot flame with glowing embers. The aroma they create while burning is delightful and adds a wonderful touch to my smoking sessions.While I primarily use them for my desktop firepit, these firewood chunks are versatile enough to be used in various outdoor products, including barbecues and smokers. When used with the centerpiece in place, they burn virtually smokeless. However, it's important to note that they should not be used indoors, as they do emit some smoke, and there's a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.Whether you have a desktop fire pit or a larger outdoor fire pit, these mini firewood chunks are an excellent choice. They provide a fantastic alternative to wood pellets and enhance your fire-burning experience.In conclusion, WFLUOLUO's Mini Firewood is a perfect addition to any fire-burning setup. Its quality, ease of ignition, delightful aroma, and versatility make it a top-notch choice. If you're looking for a convenient and efficient firewood option for your desktop smoker or outdoor fire pit, look no further. I highly recommend giving this product a try and elevating your fire-burning enjoyment.",

                "reviewText": "I began ordering kiln dried firewood years ago and had never seen mini version so had to order for our tabletop where we roast marshmallows with the kids. What I love about kiln dried is no risk of insects or eggs on the wood to store indoors and makes easier to light and burn. This is a great set ordered the box that comes with 8 fire starters (look like little nests) and 3.5\" long pine firewood roughly 1\" thick. Easy to light and burns great! Will be ordering again! Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This is a great set of firewood sticks. You could use them in any fire but they are perfect for camp stoves. They burn really nicely and evenly, and the pine smell is wonderful. I have an ATiAP titanium wood stove that is 4.5\u201d x 4.5\u201d and 7\u201d high, and these pieces of firewood fit perfectly. They catch and burn pretty good, although you do need some kind of separate fire starter to get them going. The box I ordered had a set of 8 wood-wool type fire starters which paired perfectly with the firewood. You just need a fire starter that burns for several minutes in order to get the fire sticks to catch and start burning on their own. Overall, this is a great set and I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Used these for this last winter storm here in the midwest in our wood burning fireplace in place of newspaper and they worked beautifully! Wood fired up quickly and got us warm in minutes. I used 2-3 pieces of firewood and one single mini firestarter. I probably only needed 1 piece of wood. These would be amazing in a hiking pack or for camping when firestarter or dry wood is sparse. Very compact, about the size of just your palm but thick. The firestarter looks like a clump of dry angelhair noodles (it isn't but it just looks this way) and melts quickly into the firewood to make a blaze. Next time I will try just the firewood as a starter and see if it ignites just as quickly. The firewood can easily be put into a beautiful decorative box to set nearby the woodstove for ease of use and ornamental. I will be putting several of these little blocks in each backpack for hiking! Love that it is natural and no added chemicals.",
