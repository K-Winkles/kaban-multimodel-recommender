It is expensive but the convenience of it and it has its own pot and pan is worth it. Each burner was easy to light and control the flame. The pans are non stick and cleaned up easily.",

                "reviewText": "I have used this stove a few times since purchasing it. Here are a few thoughts.Pros1. It is very compact and easy to transport. Takes up very little packing space. I actually take it with me when I go on day fishing trips and I can easily take it out and make lunch on my tailgate.2. Easy to control the heat. The knobs for gas control make it very easy to control the flow and thus the heat very precisely.3. It is very well made. My buddies all have the Coleman stove that is similar and now are drooling over this.4. I haven\u2019t yet found the need to, but it is expandable.Cons1. I actually read this before buying it and found that with the stove directly in the pots it actually can scratch and damage the pots, so I followed one bit of advice and just put an old dish towel in around the stove to protect the pot.2. The windscreen is a little difficult to use and I feel as though it might just blow away in the wind it is trying to block.Other observations1. One other camper that I was with last weekend made the comment that you can\u2019t put a griddle on it like you can a Coleman two burner stove or a camp chef. My response to that was, if I am going to be cooking for enough people that I really need a griddle like that, then I will just bring my camp chef. Otherwise, when cooking for myself and my family of 5, this works perfectly. It was never intended to compete with the camp chef line of stoves anyway.",

                "reviewText": "picked up the Genesis as a way to make my pack out a little smaller over my current stove setup. its nice and compact how everything fits together. i like the pan but i think the pot is a little too big for most camp needs. I see the reason behind it though as it allows for everything to be all in one piece. i do find myself taking an additional smaller pot to cook with as im not making family sized meals. the flame is kind of annoying as you have to spin it several times to even get it to light. the caveat is that you have more adjustability to control your flame other than just being on and off. what i find annoying is in brighter settings i cant see where the flame is - i guess i can try to count the turns? anyway, its a nice compact size but should be $100 less than what i bought at. that price is more reasonable in my eyes. YMMV",
