Got the semi-opaque ones and they look ok, probably should've got the white ones to match my stove for color consistency but wasn't sure if they'd stain, so the opaque ones are it . They were extremely easy to place between the stove and counter/cabinets and has been doing the job very well so far. Be sure to measure before ordering though. I left a hot item on a portion of one strip and it didn't harm it in any way, so that's a plus. The price was decent from this company. Happy with this purchase.",

It would only fit a surface that's very close to even and flat to each other (stove surface even with the counter top) our counter top is a little higher than the stove top and it's not conforming to the difference. The only thing it's doing for us is keeping splash out of the open space. If something was to spill it would'nt help any.",
