We still had butane left over in the first bottle we took. It was super easy to use, has a very quick and easy to use starter, the flame control is great, it was easy to clean, and it was big enough to hold a decent-size skillet. It also heated water in my kettle up to boiling in less than two minutes. It comes with a plastic case that is a little cheap and hard to close, but the stove itself is well-worth the price! It's probably worth more than I paid for it quite honestly!",

                "reviewText": "another update (Dec 2018)Power outage in Nov (15 hours) due to ice storm. This was the reason I originally bought this little stove, after all.Put some water in a camp coffee pot (without the inner components), and boiled it to make tea before I left for work (gotta have my tea before I start my day!). Worked great. It came to a full, rolling boil. Was planning to make some pasta for dinner on it when I got home (checked in with the parents all thru the day, power was still out), but then power came back on about a half hour before I got home. But I know from the rolling boil I had that morning, making pasta or rice would not have been a problem.Still on that first can of fuel.-------------------------update (Feb 2018):Have used this 3 times to do a fish fry outside (easier clean up than using the stove inside, since boiling oil tends to splatter). Still on my first can of fuel. Works great! Oil in a 10 inch cast iron skillet gets plenty hot. Fish is delish! Very pleased with this stove.----------------------original review:Bought this to have as a back up in case of a power outage (microwave and stove/range both work on electricity). Don't plan on using this a lot, but wanted to try it out when it arrived, just to make sure it worked, and be sure of how it works.This little thing is amazing. It lit really easy...on the first try. I'm not sure if you can use a regular Teflon skillet on a gas flame, so I used a 10 inch; cast iron skillet. It got really hot! I fried up hot dogs (first) and kielbasa after that. Took only about 20 minutes. I'm thinking you can probably fry up eggs, sausage, boil water for tea or coffee, maybe even boil water in a small pot for pasta or hot cereal. It has a dial to be able to adjust the flame, low or high. Just be sure to stay above the minimum...I went a little below that, and the flame went out. But, re-lit with no problem.In my research to find this item, it seemed like there were many brands that basically work the same way. I went with the Coleman version because I know they have been making products like this for a long time...well known name. The one thing that this one doesn't seem to do that the other ones do....others apparently come with the black burner turned down (space saver?), and when you get it, you have to flip it over. This one is already flipped, and it's secured in place. Nice and stable. My only problem with that is that you can't remove it to clean under it. I don't see any way to release or remove it.Uses butane canisters...really easy to insert. They look just like an aerosol can. I bought a pack of 4. Averaged $4 per can. If you plan on using this stove a lot (camping, tailgating, picnics, etc), then buy the large quantities available...price per can will be lower. The canister lays on its side, and goes in the compartment directly behind the dial. It has a hinged door that hides it away, and keeps it from being exposed. Unit is all-in-one, easy to move.Of all the different styles of camp stoves I researched, this one seemed to be the easiest to use, and appeared to be the safest. (There was actually one that was 'dual fuel' - one of the fuels available to be used was gasoline. I thought that was great, since fuel readily available, until I saw the tubing that carried the fuel from the tank to the input actually ran thru the flame on the burner!). This one has uses no tubing, no regulator, nothing like that. It snaps in one way, and locks in place. I didn't use the entire can, so I disconnected it, put the cap back on, and will be able to use it next time.Comes with a nice little carrying case for transport or storage. Plastic box with handle...like a mini briefcase.",

                "reviewText": "Style: A-Pro: This blue butane single-burner stove is small and stylish and gives car camping a super fun home-away-from-home kind of feel.Con: The minus is not because of the stove, but because the carrying case is made of rather cheap plastic, though it is light enough and does the job of being protective and easy to tote along with other camping gear, so it's definitely not a deal-breaker for me (and the stove is so cheap that one shouldn't expect much in terms of \"extras\").Ease of use: A+I watched a couple of videos to learn how to install the butane gas and turn it on and off, but honestly, this is so user-friendly that even a kid can do it.Cook Worthiness: B+I love gas stoves! I titled this review \"better than my stove at home\" because I'm cooking on an electric range at home right now, and it's just not in the same league as cooking over gas. However, I did knock a few points from this stove's cook-worthiness because it's a little tricky to get the gas at just the right level so as not to burn the pancakes/eggs/whatever you plan to cook. What I typically think of as needing medium-high heat at home seems to need more of what would be medium-low heat for this stove. The benefit of this is that it's super easy to get a good hot flame for quickly boiling water - hence coffee making can happen with ease!Stability: A+This is my first camp stove and I have to say that I felt pretty savvy being able to cook with my cast-iron skillet while the folks that I was camping with were having trouble with a rickety metal pot toppling over their old-school style screw-on-the-gas-can single-burner stove.Versatility: AI took note of another poster's comment about using their stove to cook frozen meat and keep food from going bad during a hurricane, and I plan to do this too. Not that I'm looking forward to our next hurricane, but I'm super glad that I have this stove and I've stocked up on butane gas to make sure that I'm ready for when the next one arrives!",
