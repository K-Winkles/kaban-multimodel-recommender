                "reviewText": "I got two of these burners (2burners on each) after I tried the first one out and loved it. The reason I got it to begin with is that I have a very large glass cooktop made by GE which was very difficult to clean. And when our son left home and my husband took over his duties of cleaning countertops and the stove top after dinner, he hated it so much, I began to investigate what alternative methods I could use to cook a meal.I first tried cooking everything in the oven and burned myself badly twice! That\u2019s when I investigated getting a burner that I could plug-in like this one. I love it! Yes, it takes longer to heat up to high but I just add time for that. I have never made better omelettes than using this burner and the reason is I can\u2019t hurry along like I used to try on the stove top and then get it rubbery and overcooked! It cooks eggs absolutely perfectly.And everything else perfectly too. I even used it to boil pasta and it worked out great. I just had to give it extra time to come to a boil. So now I use two of these every evening and in addition, an incredible large electric pot for large meals that I want to simmer. For searing and browning food, I have another very large electric pan, as well, so the only time I\u2019ve had to use my glass cooktop was for Thanksgiving when I was making too many items to use the burners. Cleaning that terrible cooktop twice a year for holidays is not too much for our family!So what you should know about these burners, is that they work perfectly, but you will need more time to get it hot to begin with. They are extremely easy to clean and there\u2019s no place for anything to go underneath something that is unreachable. I overboiled some soup and thought that it would be a mess to clean up, but it wasn\u2019t at all! I simply got a sponge and wiped it off. I can\u2019t think of a single thing that I don\u2019t like about these burners which are so incredibly reasonably priced. I hope if you get them that you enjoy them as much as I do!",

Functions basically the same and it heats things up just like a regular stovetop. My only critic is that the heat settings are a little hard to get used to and it takes a while to heat up but all in all, I don't know what we would've done without it in the meantime!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this in order to cook in my room as most of the house I'm staying in is shared space and my job keeps me up at odd hours. Honestly it's worth it, but it does have pros and cons.Cons:Chassis is just cheap, easily dentable and can be pulled apart easily if you try. So if you don't have a safe area to keep it, it can be destroyed if dropped.The right burner started rusting basically immediately. No amount of immediate clean up or Bleach or other cleaners are helping, it's just slowly rusting.The burners themselves are a little small, if that's something that'll bother you. I cook for one person, but cooking many things or for many people will start causing issues.Pros:It gets pretty hot, I have no issues cooking anything I need.While the Chassis feels cheap, the burners are built fine and I don't have any safety issues using them.1500 total watts, one burner is 900 and one is 600, so if you're worried about flipping any breakers you can adjust which side you use.A good purchase for the price, something for college students or camping gear if you expect to have power.",

                "reviewText": "My built in cooktop died, and repairing it is gonna be costly, so I picked this up to have something in the interim. I've been using it every day since it arrived (about 3 1/2 months, now). I can cook on both burners at once, and boil on both. Time to boil is good, and the thermostat seems to keep a pretty steady temp.There are a couple of minor drawbacks.The burners are ridged. While this doesn't (as far as I can see) adversely affect cooking, it does make them more difficult to clean. Wiping them with paper towels gets you paper fuzz rubbed off the towels and left behind on the burners. Same with sponges.There are no shields or guards over the knobs, so if you're simmering or something spills, whatever hits the body of the housing can just run down the side and get behind the knobs. They stand clear from the body, so you CAN get back there to clean, but it's kind of a pain.Other than the cleaning issues, which are minor, I'm completely happy with the unit.",

                "reviewText": "After a year of using one of these as the only cooking appliance for a family of foodies, I can say it is an excellent choice. Good and bad follows, mostly good.This thing is great for what it is, and what it does. Just bought a second unit to have 4 burner ability...OK, up front - some are defective, if you get one with issues, just return it.(Hey, it costs about one pizza, delivered, after all!)It is a 1500 watt cooktop, reasonably priced, with cast iron burners. The 1500 watts means a bit slower heating than an 1800 watt unit - but if you are in a place where you can't put it on its own 20 amp circuit breaker, you stand a better chance of actually using it. Divided into 900 and 600 watts means left side is nearly a thousand watt cooktop, right side is 20% hotter than a 500 watt cooktop. Good compromise.It gets hot, it controls the temperature reasonably well for what it is. Coil cooktops are notorious for boiling over or just sitting there, cast iron mellows out the temperature fluctuations. Countertop doesn't get too hot, and we've used much larger pans than the size of the burners - though if pushed to the ridiculous, the outer edges of a big frying pan might not be quite warm enough. To be expected.We've prepared just about everything under the sun on these things - and it's more economical and generates less humidity in the house than a gas stove - efficient with all pots and pans, not just the ones that are induction capable - and just as efficient - the only thing I can say is \"well done\"...Small, easy to transport, good for travel, too.Recommended.",

It started heating up within a couple of minutes. Full boil at over 200 degrees F by the 10 minute mark as shown on the video. I think it will be fine for coffee, drinks and boiling eggs or soup. I didn\u2019t put both burners to use at the same time except to follow the instructions to put them on at Level 1 for 15 minutes to burn off the initial smell. The smell wasn\u2019t too bad. The whole unit does get very hot so be careful ( not safe around young children). The burners have fine grooves so are harder to clean and you need to wait a while for them to cool down before you can wipe them down. Still, for a camping stove (at an electrical site) or maybe a dorm room, it works fine for the low price. Looking forward to use it for our winter camping trip in February!",

This is when I decided to get this model instead and im so happy I did. The cast iron plates are perfectly flat and now I can leave stuff on it to cook unattended while I do other stuff around the house. The iron cast surface is a bit bigger then the electic burners of simiar size stoves, heat is well evenly distributed and I am not restricted on what kind of pots to use like convection stove options. It is very easy to clean, light-weight, takes very little space and the rubber legs keep stove safely in place. Temperature controls work well, temp is increasing/dicreasing accordingly. It is of great quality and I find it very affordable. I would not want a fancier one, this fits all my needs and expectations. Even funner for me is that I can take it with me camping summers. I'm definitely getting my money worth with this baby.",

The bottom legs also left marks all over my rental counters and after scrubbing I got them pretty light but even the magic eraser did not remove what\u2019s left. Will be returning. We have had it less Han a month and it\u2019s breaking. The heat intervals are also not accurate for easy cooking, constantly adjusting them to keep my food cooking at the temp I need. And it takes over 15 minutes with hot tap water to boil. My foods take way too long on here it just can\u2019t get hot enough. My old cooktop boiled water in 5 minutes so the technology exists but not in this poorly built item",
