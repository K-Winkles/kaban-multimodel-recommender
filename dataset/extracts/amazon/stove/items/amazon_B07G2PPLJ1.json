                "reviewText": "I refurbished a used wood stove I bought from Facebook Market. I used an angel grinder with scotch bright and steel wire attachments to fully remove all rust. I then used the Imperial polish over the entire surface. It failed for this reason. Any very flat surface without texture it doesn't stick very well. Most importantly, any surface you go down to bare metal and see silver metal, it will not cover that. You will see those blemishes very noticeably. It took three hours to take both coats of polish off. I found the best way was scotch brite with Comet and a little water. I power washed it prior to that. Then took a steel wire brush to get all the crevices. I bought Meeco Wood Stove paint and painted the entire thing. It looks great. Now that everything is covered and solid black, Imperial polish is what I will use to maintain it. So, my advice is to be careful when taking the rust off, to not go down to the metal. If you can do that then go with the Imperial polish, if you see silver showing, paint the entire thing or touch it up with paint and then polish.I hope this saves someone a little time. I think it is a great product, but it won't cover raw silver colored metal and make it black.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my wood stove, and granted, have not tried that yet. But I had this old kettle that got SO neglected over the years so I decided to use it as a test piece.The internet has A LOT of opinions about what to do with rusty cast cookware, but I first wire brushed this inside and out (a lot), then used steel wool after that, and lastly washed in warm water. I let it dry thoroughly outdoors, then seasoned with canola oil inside and out. Then baked at 400 degrees for 2 hours (sitting upside down with tin foil to drip onto if necessary). Then cooled overnight. By this time, it looked much better already but more grey than black with hints of rust. So finally, applied polish to the outside only with a damp baby facecloth, waited at least 10 mins, then easily polished and buffed it with a dry old dish rag. After I was done, I boiled water on the stove and noticed no odor at all. What a change! Can't wait to try the stove!",
