I saw these and decided to try them and I think I'll recommend them although I may experiment with some other products later. The good, the cover the area well, they take the heat with no problem and they've been easy to clean so far. The not so good, they are a bit of a pain to fit to your burners and get to stay in place while you put grates back in place. You have to cut them to size which is a bit of a challenge around the round burner and then once you do cut them (you have to cut inside circle to fit and the outside edges as well) they want to slide all over the place while you are reinserting the grates. I will say that once you have it reassembled there's no problem with them moving. While I hope to find a better product I will say that this product does work and is worlds better than having nothing covering your stove top.",

What they won't do, is to keep a larger spill from leaking under the covers, but I didn't expect them to. They'll help keep most splatters off the range and if we have people over, we'll just remove them. I'm happy with them.",

Anything spilled on them and seemingly baked onto them comes off easily! It's amazing hwo easy they are to clean. You can also run them through the dishwasher. They are made of fiberglass so they withstand any punishment, I highly recommend!",
