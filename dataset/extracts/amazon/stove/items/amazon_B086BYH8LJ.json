                "reviewText": "For years I had wanted to need one of those way cool induction cook tops. Now finally, there was a need, but when I read the 1s and 2s reviews, this was the no-brainer choice for me. The complaints were that the induction cook tops only have @ 3.5\" heating surface, and I needed to be able to cook my 2 eggs over easy just right. This has over 5\" of heat coil, tried and true technology, and does the job nicely. Plus, the price is incredible, and it heats and cools quickly. The thing they conveniently forget to tell you about the induction cook top is that as the pot heats on it, the pot heats the glass surface as well, so it becomes very hot. My experience is that glass holds its heat. When is someone likely to be accidentally burned? Before putting on the pot or after taking it off? One need only remember to turn on the heat after putting on the pot in order to be adequately safe. The knob turns easily, so one must get into the habit of checking it is off before plugging the unit in.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this to try boiling about 20 gallons of maple sap into syrup in a purely hobbyist endeavor. (This boiling had to be done outside. You can't boil that much water in your house without drywall slumping off your walls or ceiling!)This was probably not what the manufacturer had in mind... still, I wanted to give it a try after spending a ridiculous amount of money on propane to do the same thing last year.I really appreciated the metal construction. It held up well under a pot filled with 1.5 gallons of sap (about 13 pounds including the pot). I'm sure it could have held more weight than that without a problem. It heated up very quickly and stayed hot during an average 4 hour boiling session.1200 watts is enough to boil a pot of sap (which starts out 98% water) but not boil it away very quickly. I can get a 1500 watt space heater, and my wife owns a 1875 watt hair dryer. Why can't I find a hot plate with more power than 1200 watts?It eventually took about 30 hours to turn 19 gallons of sap into steam. I thought I might very well kill this thing before I was done, but it still works (and looks!) like new.",

I've used a tea kettle and medium pot. It boiledpretty quick, but, not now....The base is pretty hot to the touch, so, don't.... Total disaster of a product.

                "reviewText": "I bought both products below:1. The Proctor Silex Electric Single Burner Cooktop, Compact and Portable, Adjustable Temperature Hot Plate, 1200 Watts, White & Stainless (34106). ASIN #: B086BYH8LJ2. The Ovente 1700W Double Hot Plate Electric Countertop Coil Stove 5.7 & 6 Inch with Dual 5 Level Temperature Control & Stainless Steel Base, Easy Clean Portable Cooktop Burner for Cooking, Black BGC102B. ASIN #: B07HJQCSXHThe Proctor Silex pros:-Heats significantly faster, and water is actually boiling, however will have problems with medium and larger pots with more water.-Easy to clean (you can lift up the coil)-The coils have more surface area (i.e. more coiled metal) so it heats faster-The coils have a flat top, so pots/pans stay on it much betterCons:-The power cord is very short. I had to get an extension cable (as you can't use a regular extension cable or you can start a file) with enough electrical capacity to carry the juice, such as this item: 12 Ft Appliance Extension Cord Heavy Duty, Gray - 14 Gauge 3 Prong SPT-3 Cable for Air Conditioner or Refrigerator (ASIN #: B07ZS2X5VB)-The power LED comes on the moment you plug it. But to be fair, this is working as designed because it's a \"power\" LED that shows when it has power and NOT an LED that comes on when you actually have the knob turned to on. It's a poor design, but it is working as designed.-It won't be as powerful or as hot as a typical stove, so don't whine about it. A typical stove has its own dedicated circuit. That's like buying a scooter and complaining it doesn't go as fast as your car.*************************************The Ovente pros:-It has two burnersCons:-Cooking things on top of it, sometimes the pots and pans move so you have to use one hand to hold the pot/pan, such as when cooking eggs. This is because the top of the coils are not flat, and some parts stick slightly up higher.-Water did eventually boil after a significant amount of time longer than the Proctor Silex, but the water appears to \"simmer\" more than boil. I believe this is due to the fact the coil has less surface area to make contact.-Power cord also very short, but slightly longer than the Proctor Silex. Still, it's too short and I needed a powerful 14 gauge power extension to use it under the vent.-The unit itself got much hotter than the Proctor Silex, so you can easily burn yourself if you're not careful.I would purchase the Proctor Silex again. I wouldn't purchase the Ovente again. In fact, since it's dangerous as things can fall off the coils AND it doesn't seem to heat as well and takes a long time before water actually boils, I'll be returning it.UPDATE: Bought May 31, 2021. Dead 9/20, 2021. Oh well, I did use it multiple times a day. I guess the heat eventually killed the unit. The red light still works though :) For under $20 bucks, what did you expect?UPDATE Nov, 2022: Rebought Oct, 2021 because had no other alternative. 2nd one still working a little over a year later.UPDATE Dec, 2022: I just bought the New Wave induction cooktop to try. So far that one is great and boils water very fast and well, and doesn't generate heat (during hot summers). If you need water boiling well for pasta, go induction. You'll need special cookware though.Update August, 2023:For a year now I've been using the Nuwave induction oven and haven't looked back. It doesn't generate unnecessary heat, and best of all, it boils water like 4x faster AND maintains water boiling. I had to purchase a few induction capable pots and pans, but it's completely worth it. To put it into perspective, it's like riding a bicycle vs a car, or walking vs a bicycle.",
