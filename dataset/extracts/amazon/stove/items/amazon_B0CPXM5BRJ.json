To keep this grate from rattling and hopping out while driving, the holes in the stovetop are equipped with little rubber grommets that just snap into place. They work great, until they disappear like socks in the dryer. Sometimes they can be located by lifting the stovetop and peering underneath. Sometimes not. It's a mystery of RVing where those things disappear to. When all else fails, buy new ones. These replace the factory-issued parts perfectly.",
