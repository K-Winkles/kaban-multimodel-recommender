                "reviewText": "My parents have to pick up a new grate for their wood stove every couple years due to the stove getting really heavy usage. They burn through close to 8 cords of wood in a year as the wood stove is used as their primary heating source. These grates are pricey no matter where you buy them, but you definitely get them cheaper on Amazon then you can at the local hardware stores. My mom had commented that they were going to need a new grate for this season and that my dad was going to look for one at the local store. My parents are old school and don't look for things online. So I looked on my phone real quick and told them what the price would be to get one here on Amazon, my dad went by the local hardware store and returned empty handed. The local store was close to $50 more expensive than what was available here on Amazon. I ordered this up for them and in 2 days they had their grate. They were super happy to get it cheaper and see that it came directly from the stove company made them confident it wasn't a cheaper junk version.Definitely worth grabbing this if you need a new grate!",
