April has nice joint tolerances, no loose joints, the plastic feels good, although the elbows are dainty and very fragile looking, and not painted well either, move them with caution. She has a nice assortment of accessories, and as my headline states, I love the alternate scared/suprised head. The headset doesn't fit on her head, though I've seen some people force it and it looks kind of silly. The other accessories are nice. I like the packaging style in this series with nice window boxes, and April's box art looks great.",

                "reviewText": "Hi! This review is of April O\u2019Neil :)I shot some silly pictures to show some of her articulation and most were taken before the below fixes; no tape, etc. was used. After the fixes, she was able to hold poses better. The picture with her arms in the air is with her fixed bent knee (tightened with liquid floor polish), which supported her weight without collapsiing. (I don't know how to load pictures in a certain sequence... sorry) Hope the pictures help :)Her head swiveled 360 degrees and mine had almost no ability to look up, down nor side to side.Her Left Butterfly Joint, Diaphragm Joint, Hip Sockets (Left was much worse), Knees (both, but Left was very loose) and both ankles were very loose.I had a little bit of experience with a different BST AXN figure (Aang), so I checked April\u2019s joints and her thigh-cut swivels were pretty tight, but not nearly as stuck as Aang\u2019s. However, her Left Hip joint popped off quickly. At first, this was okay because I wanted to remove her legs and put them in hot water for a couple minutes, to free up the thigh-cuts and the hinges on her hands. After I did that, all those joints moved much easier.To address joints the loose Hips and Diaphragm Joints, I took off her legs, put a small Kleenx-type tissue (folded in half) over the ball joint in her hips and then put the legs back in. That tightened the hips up enough, for me. The Diaphragm was \"fixed\" the same way, as well.I used several drops of floor polish to tighten her knees, elbows and and ankles... that held them \u201cokay\u201d, but I think this will need to be done often. I don\u2019t want to say what brand, as I am not trying to promote any brand of floor polish. But, if you choose that method, best to research to see which might be best for your needs or even a better method.Her waist looked like it could swivel around, but I was not able to get it to move, so figured the waist wasn\u2019t meant to swivel. This is not a complaint, but an observation in case anyone tries to swivel it and might break theirs.- Overall thoughts -One thing I really liked was how posable her legs were, even though they came off easily. The Hip Joints were able to turn 360 degrees and turning the legs 180 degrees via the Thigh Cuts didn\u2019t look horrid to me, but might to some other people.Although the hips popped off very easily and other joints were floppy, I figured I\u2019d rather have that happen than have joints bend or break because they were too tight or stuck. The temporary fixes for the joints were easy to do, but will need to be redone as needed.I almost forgot... I really appreciated that her trigger finger is soft, so was easily positionable to get the finger into the trigger well.Rating...I feel the ranges of motion inspired creative posing that I\u2019d not been able to do with most of my other action figures in this price range. However, the loose joints detracted from the fun factor; doing DIY fixes didn\u2019t bother me. The result is a 3.40 out of 5 stars. Due to the whole star rating system, sadly dropping to 3 stars.",
