This is a character that I wanted in figure form for a while and I'm glad to finally get her. The sculpting and detail is great and she has all the articulation that you come to expect from a six inch Hasbro figure. Her accessories aren't bad either. She's atad on the small size but still scales well with other figures in this scale.",
