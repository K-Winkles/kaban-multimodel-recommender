                "reviewText": "'Epic' and 'so cool' were what the 7 year old described Bane and Batman figures as. They're quite sturdy and very large at about a foot tall! They come with several bits and bobs to attach to each of the figures. We liked that there wasn't anything attaching the figures to the box - you know how sometimes you feel like you need to have a degree in engineering to get into some kids toys - this one you don't! Each part of the limbs is moveable which is great for more action shots, this does mean that you need to position the figures carefully to balance them for standing. Perfect for Batman fans.",

                "reviewText": "This comes from a person who hates plastic toys: I was so impressed with these, I spent some time playing with these when the children opened the box!These toys do look very impressive. The Batman does have a permanent body-builder-in-a-competition stoop, like chin to the chest, shoulders forward, fist together in the crutch area, but he is still one of the best action figures we have had. The chunky villain is well made, too. He does drop his tnt's (or whatever those things are) easily - they just do not stay in place and with the lightest touch detach themselves - but the rest of the accessories are quite difficult to remove on thus figurines. A better balance of ease/difficulty would be more preferable, but they might as well have improved the next batch, maybe.The points of articulation are very impressive, well, ex hockey player level. So, yeah, they won't do all the yoga stuff, but then they won't wobble about with every shake, so they are sturdy and you can pose them quite well.I find these really well made and the best action figures that I laid my hands on, and I am really not a fan of this stuff in general.",
