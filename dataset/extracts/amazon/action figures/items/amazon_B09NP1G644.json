                "reviewText": "The lights and sounds work well and the toy is rather loud. It reminds me of the electronic Batmobile made for The Batman. Personally, I would prefer it quieter or with an option for a muffled mode, but I understand why they want it loud to impress the kiddies.The plastic of the vehicle feels fairly solid and it looks nice overall. The cockpit is definitely cramped. (As photographed, you have to twist the figure's legs into an awkward position in order to close the vehicle.) I wish a little more effort was put into planning Spin Masters's vehicles' interiors and scale. The aformentioned Batmobile from The Batman felt a little too big for its figures. The Hawk plane from Black Adam had lame lay-your-figure-down spaces. And now this submarine requires figures contort to be seated inside it.The figures are of reasonable quality for the scale, but it did feel like I was going to break the knees the first time I moved them. If getting these for a child, it might be a good idea for an adult to carefully loosen the joints first. Otherwise, I worry that the thin joint pegs may break as the plastic of the joint tends to \"stick\" to the limbs.The figures are painted well and scale with other 3+3/4 - 4inch figures such as Hasbro's recent X-Men releases.Overall it is a nice toy. You are essentially getting two $10 figures packed in with a $10 vehicle. And, if you look at it that way, then it is a really good deal. However, these figures seem to be in plenty of other multipacks, and the box is way oversized. So, I wonder if there wasn't a way that the vehicle could have been sold separately for a lesser price-point.One big missed opportunity is a lack of handholds for Aquaman to grab onto the sub or a stand so that he could be placed underneath as if holding it above him. It also would have been fun if there was a break apart feature. Like if his trident could have been stabbed into the vehicle in a particular spot to activate a spring that blew the vehicle in half. I don't know if any scenes like that will end up doing in the film. But most toys don't care about screen accuracy to that extent, and they would have been fun features to include.As it is, the vehicle is too small to be impressive on size alone, doesn't have engaging physical play features, and features figures that will probably be packed in many other sets. However, the price you pay isn't unreasonable. At about $30, the set is a fair value. And the lights and sounds work well and are clear and loud. The box is probably too oversized versus the small basic sub for this set to be very attractive to collectors. However, for the kids' market, I think it is acceptable, especially if you are just buying one Aquaman toy for them and not every figure/multipack. For a film releasing during the holiday season, I feel that this set would make a really great Christmas gift for any kid that is a DC fan.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019m familiar with the DC Comics figures and I love how Spin Masters continues to make these 4-inch posable figures. Even though I haven\u2019t seen the Aquaman films I always loved the look of Black Manta, so it was great to see an action figure in the line for this character.It\u2019s a little tricky removing the figures and accessories from the package because of the tight plastic ties they use. When finally removed you\u2019ll notice the figures have decent articulation with movement of the arms, legs, elbows, knees and thighs. Hands can easily grasp the included weapons. Paint application is simple, but consistent and resembles the characters very well. I did notice my Aquaman knees and elbows were a bit stiff at first. The 2 weapons are a softer plastic and bend. Which is good since they won\u2019t break easily, however they did come a little malformed out of the box and might require some hot water to straighten them a bit.The submarine is fairly simple with no moving parts other than a cockpit door and back fans. You can fit either figure inside, but not the weapons. The sub lacks some detail, but underneath has some nice bright orange matching with the flat black of the hull. The ship also has lights and sounds (batteries are included). When activated the eyes of the sub light up and flash depended on the sound effect that is played. The sonar or laser gun on my sub was also a softer plastic and was slightly bent out of the box. Because of the electronics you cannot submerge this in water. I would have liked to see a stand included or a way to display the vehicle on a shelf.While I like the Black Manta figure a lot, neither figure is an exclusive to this set. The ship is a nice addition, but the plastic doesn\u2019t feel as solid as the figures and lacks some details to really make it special considering the price point. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll regret adding this to your collection, and fans should enjoy reenacting their favorite scenes of the movie.",
