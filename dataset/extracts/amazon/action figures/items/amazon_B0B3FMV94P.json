                "reviewText": "The resemblance to Vincent D'Onofrio is so uncanny with the face scan. The only thing that doesn't match is the body mold. Kingpin should be towering over the likes of Daredevil and Elektra. It is quite unfortunate the body mold seems to be a Happy Hogan which lacks the size of a proper Kingpin. I'm just happy I have this version of Kingpin and not having to pay a ridiculous amount for the retro wave one. I just wished it was a bigger body mold with better articulation. I highly recommend this figure if you're a fan of the Netflix Daredevil series or if you're a MCU collector. If you're on the fence, wait for a sale.",
