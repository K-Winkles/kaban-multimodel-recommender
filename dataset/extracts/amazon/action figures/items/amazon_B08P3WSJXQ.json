                "reviewText": "I bought the Thing to use for a photo project. I like to keep figures stored in the package, so I cut the bottom panel where it meets the card, and two more cuts on the sides, just around the bottom corners. This allows me to bend the panel upward, and slide the inner tray out and re-use the packaging.The joints were really stiff, so I gave him my usual boil and oil treatment: Dunk the figure in a pot of boiling water for 30-45 seconds. Turn the heat off, transfer the pot to the kitchen sink, and empty the water and figure into a plastic colander. While the figure is still warm, apply one or two drops of silicone shock oil to all of the joints, and carefully move them back and forth.Once I got all of the joints working, I upgraded him with a pair of dark blue fabric shorts, and gave him a slice of pizza. He has good articulation, but doesn't have double jointed elbows or bicep swivels, so eating that slice will be a challenge! He has a decent weight to him, and holds poses very well.I like the orange shading used on him, looks like a comic book image I found online, of the Thing taking a pepperoni pizza out of the oven, wearing a chef's hat, apron and oven mitts..a nice touch for a \"retro\" figure.I'm very happy with the Thing, great price, looks good and feels sturdy...it's clobberin' time!",

But Ben Grimm aka the Thing was not among them. So, resorting to Amazon, I ordered the figure. And wow, all I can say is that it's really nice looking, love the vivid orangeness of it, heavier and more solid then I expected; great sculpt with similarities and differences to the previous Marvel Legends release being noted. It comes with another head showing Grimm GRIMacing (sorry, had to do it) as he would in the heat of the fight. I really like the packaging as well; the bright colors on the stiff card, the round plastic bubble, cool looking. Quick delivery, on time, great to give as a gift, or to keep in your own collection!
