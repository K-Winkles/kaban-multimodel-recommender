They also have suprisingly good articulation in the knees and elbows. The clothes and weapons are a bit flimsy but this allows for more flexibility in posing. I would recommend being gentle while handling them since they are more delicate than your average action figure, but I've had no problems so far.ps: I used sticky tack to secure the arrow on Legolas's bow.",

It's not like those cheap figures that only subtly look like the character. The detailing to match Gandalf is fantastic! The most impressive thing about this figure is that it has spectacular articulation! Pretty much every single joint has articulation like it should so the figure is highly possible or playable. He stands freely and easily! He has good accessories which include his staff and sword. We did order this figure for our son who LOVES figures but, honestly we want to order a second for our own LOTR collection. He looks so cool next to our LOTR pops. I can't recommend this figure enough! It looks great and its beautifully packaged and well made! Seriously, couldn't be happier with this figure or recommend it more! Like I said we'll be ordering a second for our own collection! Seriously, Don't hesitate! It's worth the costs, looks good and is well made! (even our toddler son kept the box because it looks so cool and has character to it!)",

                "reviewText": "I was excited to get this figure but was disappointed right out of the box. The figure is very small and has bad articulation. I actually broke the right arm when moving the figure\u2019s elbow joint. I was upset to say the least. I give the figure a 2 because (1) it\u2019s hard to find an affordable Sauron figure and (2) the detail is amazing. I honestly wish they made the figure a 6 or 7 inch since the armor has many little parts that many actually broke off mine. I did reglue them though. Besides that I kept the figure as I didn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of getting a return at the time. In any case the figure is only perfect to display in the box.",
