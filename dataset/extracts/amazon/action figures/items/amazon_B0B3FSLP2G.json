I am extremely happy it isn't, because I didn't like the look too much. This is my first Nick Fury figure, and it does not disappoint! His beard is a bit long if you intend on displaying him as an Avengers (2012) Nick, but it will work. One complaint is the legs and arms are a little warped out of the box and a the legs are a bit hard to pose because of the trench coat. Also, I don't understand Hasbro's choice of pistols. They seem a bit too Star Wars influenced. In the show he uses Glocks. One cool touch though is the different variations of smoke and blast effects. The smaller smoke and blast effects are intended for the suppressed pistol. The other two are for the unsuppressed version. The BAF piece also looks nicely done.",

                "reviewText": "The Nick Fury Head sculpt is nice. And joy of joys the stocking cap comes off and fits other figures.Everything from the Neck Down in encased in this stiff unyielding rubber trenchcoat. Making articulation pointless. Did the guy who designed the D&D Movie line make this figure?The accessories are good. A silenced pistol, regular pistor, 2 smoke effects and 2 gunshot effects. Which are nice... but why do Marvel Legends effects parts have a different peg size than GI Joe? Or Indiana Jones? Hasbro makes great smoke effect parts but they don't work with any of their lines that use guns! GAAAHHHH!Still a good Samuel L Jackson head and hat. I put it on a Valaverse Action Force body.",
