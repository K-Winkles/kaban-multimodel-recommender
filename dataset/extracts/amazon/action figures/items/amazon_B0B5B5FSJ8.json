It appears on the box that he can be on all 4s but this is not possible, as nothing else bends or moves on this figure. He doesn't even stand because his legs cannot be adjusted to help him balance. If you are buying this as a collector and plan to not open it, it is detailed and looks nice, but as a person who wanted articulation and movement of a toy, this would not be for you.Arrived broken. Unfortunately I did not have time to return this item and wait for a return and I had to super glue his face back together.",

Quindi pagato caro, tempi di attesa lunghi e neanche funziona come dovrebbe! Chiederei il reso, ma mio figlio ha gi\u00e0 atteso tanto per averlo e non vorrei rovinargli ancora di pi\u00f9 la \"sorpresa\".
