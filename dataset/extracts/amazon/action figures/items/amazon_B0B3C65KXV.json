Unfortunately it was pretty hard to find and was a bit pricey for the time. Nowadays the original goes for upwards of $200+ and I was always disappointed by the scale of the original, which seemed very oversized compared to the other TMNT figures.I just happened to stumble across this version of Krang's Android Body by Loyal Subjects and immediately had to have it! I didn't even know this was coming out but the sculpt, features, and XL size hypnotized me with it's Utrom powers! It not only looks great but it fits perfectly among my old school Ninja Turtle toys!The $30 price tag seems perfect for this figure! This is a lovingly crafted product which can be equally described as a collectible or a play thing. I may end up buying a second one for my kids to play with!",

                "reviewText": "First, this thing is freaking huge, and it is heavy. That's in no way a bad thing though, the weight definitely helps make it so he won't topple on the shelf. Also has a ton of cool swap out weapons to replace both hands which is a nice touch. The figure also comes with a removable Krang, which sits inside the chest cavity by cracking the entire figure in half, pulling his tentacles off, and sitting him inside. That's also one of the complaints I have about this set though, while he's sitting inside they designed it so that he has a smaller set of tentacles that are operating the controls of the suit, and those are non-removable, so if you want to have it posed so that he is outside of the suit it does look a little weird that he still has disembodied tentacles wrapped around the controls. Also, the antenna forks on top of his head are made from a really soft plastic, and on mine they arrived kind of bent over and laying flat against the top of his head instead of pointing up. Not necessarily a deal breaker, but still something worth noting. Overall, definitely an awesome looking figure and worth picking up.",
