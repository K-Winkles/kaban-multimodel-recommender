                "reviewText": "I'm surprised how much this Grail Knight figure jumps off the screen into action figure form. Adventure Series has been a pretty good line but this knight is top tier. His detailed sculpt looks just like the actor and covers a good range of his expressiveness.The accessories are surprisingly nice, the sword looks good with its subtly-painted hilt, the scabbard looks good and works very well, the true grail looks just like the film with that subtle gold interior, the other pieces look nice too; the only thing missing is an alternate right hand for that wave he does in his final scene.The paint seemed simple at first, but there's a lot going on, and the knight kept clean so he didn't have any weathering, although a subtle wash might have been nice for realism. Silvery plastic handles the chainmail, and looks better than most armored figures using this technique. The face is painted surprisingly tightly for a mainstream figure with a beard and expressive eyes. There's a lot of paint on the accessories, and even silver painted details on one of the belts, though not both. There's even a gilded painted edge to his crossed sword chest emblems, that's a lot for any company selling mass market figures.Articulation is less restrictive than I expected, the slits in the skirt mean he can move outside it to some degree, the butterfly shoulders move pretty well, the ball-jointed wrists move better than on Indy figures in this line, the elbows only go to just above 90 degrees but it's enough for me, the ball-jointed waist works well, the knees go to around 90, the ankles have good rocker joints and a deep hinge but no boot rotation. The neck is ball jointed and a little limited by the design, but moves more than I expected. His left hand holds the sword quite tightly, the right hand holds it a little loosely I suspect because the designers wanted it to double as the waving look.The cape is large and static, but it fits well, has a nice sculpt, stays in place from a peg into the back, and has nice paint on the tie and the shoulder emblem.All in all, I'm surprisingly happy with this figure, I think they did a tremendous job with the Grail Knight even above the other Adventure Series figures.",

                "reviewText": "The level of detail on display is the main selling point of this figure, as well as being a high point of the Adventure Series overall. In particular, the facial likeness and the chain mail armor are outstanding, with surprisingly little \"marbling\" that so frequently comes with using metallic plastics. Perhaps the tunic could use some weathering, but overall this is an excellent representation of the Grail Knight.What kept this figure from getting five stars is that the articulation is hindered by the stiff PVC skirt, but my main critique is that the stiff PVC cape is so long that it can actually prevent the Knight from standing. I'm a big proponent of PVC capes instead of \"soft goods\" that don't wear right and aren't durable, but Hasbro generally doesn't use the right kind of PVC for the right job. McFarlane Toys has nailed this issue with their recent Batman figures, where the cape is made of a very flexible, yet durable, PVC.",
