They are much less expensive than the acrylic display cases, yet made of a think, heavy material that protects the contents very well. The size of the protector allows for a very slightly loose fit for the card with plenty of room for the blister, but the four folding tabs inside hold the card firmly in place. Also, the locking tabs are in the front which allows for clear and unimpeded viewing of the card back. The design is brilliant! If you want to save a little money, but still protect your carded figures well and in a way that allows for a nice display, then these protectors are for you!",

They do not tip over once I figured out to put the plastic flap of the closure in front of the card. I ordered another brand to see how it matches up (Star1 case)... I will let you know which one works better once they arrive. A final tip here... these come with a thin layer of plastic which makes the plastic look cloudy. If you want to display your figures, make sure to peel it off before putting the box together. Final Summary: I like them for storage protection for my figures... but expensive for plastic boxes with no choices to get a discount if you decide to buy bulk.EDIT: I think I prefer the Star 1 Case.. easier to assemble and the cards fit nice and snug. Its not as rectangular as these, but you get a good discount if you buy more than 20.",
