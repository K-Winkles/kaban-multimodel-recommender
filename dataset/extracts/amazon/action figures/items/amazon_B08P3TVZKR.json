A must have for fans of Transformers, especially fans of classic G1 era characters. Like much of the Siege/Earthrise/Kingdom line, this is Masterpiece level engineering at a (roughly) fifty dollar price point.Good accessories too. Galvatron comes packaged with the Autobot Matrix of Leadership on a chain that the figure can wear in both robot and laser cannon mode, as well as a pair of rifles that are the same shape as the ship Unicron gave his new minions in the \u201886 movie.",

Also, it\u2019s priced as a $50 toy, but really it\u2019s about a $30-$35 toy. They throw in some extraneous accessories, but they are cheaply made and barely interact with the figure. Also, the battle damage paint should have been skipped in favor of a more detailed paint scheme.",

                "reviewText": "It's nice to see Hasbro finally allow an animation-accurate toy for Galvatron (and back into space cannon alt mode!). The drawbacks of the Titans Return figure were the excessively massive cannon on his arm and.......the very ugly head (with the crown motif held on by a post), but this has been changed with the WFC: Kingdom Galvatron.With them moving towards these animation accurate figures, to match what Takara's been doing for years, let's hope that the next change we'll get will let all figures have hands that can open and close, instead of the standard closed fist with a hole in the center. Otherwise, this is a very great Galvatron figure.",

                "reviewText": "Great looking Galvatron. The alt-mode, the chain matrix, and the general look makes it the best movie-like version available. Hopefully one day there'll be a materpiece but for something toy sized, it is the best out there currently. The tiny guns resemble his original ship. Only complaint is that Galvatron shouldn't be battle damaged. He's newly created so his toy should reflect his pristine condition.",

Tiene un problema de ensamblaje en los hombros como muchos otros ejemplares, sin embargo no es nada del otro mundo y no debe ser un decremento a la hora de comprar, adem\u00e1s que realmente no afecta en absolutamente nada fuera de un ligero detalle est\u00e9tico y un par de movimientos extra a la hora de transformar",
