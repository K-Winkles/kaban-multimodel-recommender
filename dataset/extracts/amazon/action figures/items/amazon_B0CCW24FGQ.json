                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I am really pleased with this Paw Patrol Jungle Pups fire truck. It is a gift for my nephew, who turns three next month and it\u2019s entirely age-appropriate. He watches Paw Patrol and is obsessed with fire trucks so this will be a hit for sure. It\u2019s a sturdy, colorful, well-made toy. Placing the water balls in the launcher is great for small muscle coordination. And running to retrieve all the balls or just pushing the truck to a pretend fire might tire him out enough to take a nap. It is the type of simple interactive toy he likes best. His parents will like that it requires no assembly, no batteries or charging, makes no electronic noises and the water balls store neatly in the tank in back.The instructions warn of choking hazards, but those plastic balls are pretty big as is the action figure, so I\u2019m not really seeing it as potentially hazardous. However, there should be some adult supervision with this toy so it is not aimed at pets or siblings. Plus, dogs could do a number on those balls if they think this is a fetch game for them.I am excited about finding the perfect gift and highly recommend this toy",

                "reviewText": "I gave this truck to my three year old on a day we were expecting company, and I was busy preparing food and cleaning the house. He loved it, and it not only kept him busy while I was working, he played with it all evening while the guests were conversing. This is a lot of fun because it not only encourages imaginative play, but it also encourages movement and physics reasoning skills. At first my son just launched the balls down the hallway, but later he figured out that if he positioned the truck in just the right spot, he could consistently launch balls into a bucket. He spent a good portion of the evening running up and down the hallway retrieving and launching balls and repositioning his bucket. I didn't notice him playing much with the figurine of Chase, but he was excited when he first saw the familiar pup from Paw Patrol. This is a very engaging, fun toy.",

Los cachorros miden 6 cm de alto y solo tienen articulado el cuello, lo cual permite que se pueda girar la cabeza hacia los lados.
