                "reviewText": "I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect when purchasing this figure, as this is a new line by Bandai. But it blew my expectations away immediately. It\u2019s a simple figure, but has a lot of cool features that sets it above the rest at this price point. The articulation is amazing, he can pull off most poses seen in the game. A drop down joint in his legs allows for a high kick, and the soft plastic material of his tunic doesn\u2019t hinder any articulation. The joints are nice and tight, no loose or floppy parts here! His hands are easy to interchange and he feels very durable when posing, even more than the typical high-end import figure. Not fragile at all. He\u2019s a tad short compared to the figures we are used to seeing on the shelves, but should fit right in with the standard 1/12 scale. He stands about the same height as a regular Marvel Legend figure. The face sculpt, while very simple, has a lot of personality to to it, wether I\u2019d be from his stoic frown or wrinkled brow. Compared to Bandai\u2019s other budget lines like the Dragonball and Naruto ones, I think this is miles better than those ones. This is a big step up.Pros:-Sturdy joints, durable plastic, no loose joints or defects. The legs have quality ratcheting joints that allow for some great poses-Soft plastic tunic allows the waist articulation and ab crunch to be very affective with little hindrance.- A good amount of accessories- Tons of play factor as it\u2019s durable enough for a kid to play with without feeling cheap- Import level articulationCons:- Only 1 headsculpt and 1 set of hands. It could\u2019ve benefited with some more options but is understandable at this price point- foot and Ankle articulation is a weak point, while nowhere near terrible, it could of benefited from a toe-crunch and a better pivot to achieve wider stances and poses- No Paint wash, not a very detailed figure",

Overall the figure articulates well but having pinned shoulders and elbows I'd weird in this age especially when the knees are pinless. My copy had an issue where the wrist joints were fused but that was fixed with a hot bath. Good figure with improvements already seen in wave 2",
