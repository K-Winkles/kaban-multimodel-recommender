The o rings that kept torso, hips, and legs together had deteriorated. After some investigating I found and ordered this kit, received it the next day, and had all of them repaired in a couple hours. I only needed to replace one of the metal hooks but was glad this kit included them for future use. Since some of the original screws were pretty rusted and difficult to loosen, I ended up using my own longer and more sturdy screw driver. I am very happy with this purchase than enabled me to preserve my son\u2019s childhood toys for him. If you are uncertain how to use this kit, there are GI Joe repair videos on Youtube.",
