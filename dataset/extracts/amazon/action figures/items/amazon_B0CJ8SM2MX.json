The pose stands are rather cheap, I put a small figure in one and suspended it, only to have the stand sag with the weight of the figure. Might be better for just standing, rather than action posing. The peg stands have worked great so far with two lines of figures - Star Wars 6\" black series figures and some Four Horsemen Studios Mythic Legions figures. There were times when I needed to warm the foot in order for the peg to fit in, but otherwise, these provide a nice tight fit and a stable stand. Happy with the purchase.",
