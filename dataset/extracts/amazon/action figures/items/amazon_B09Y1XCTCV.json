I definitely didn't expect the cake to be so small (like the size of a 1 year olds smash cake) my sister purchased it and I just knew it was going to be round white and red icing on top made to look like it was dripping down. It was actually a really nice cake. But since the characters were also surprisingly bigger than expected (which was the best part) they instead went around the cake. I think I got 5 or 6 in the pack. All we made great and he loves playing with them. They are all about 6 inches? Very good size for only about $20! They also each had a cool light on the front middle that flashes when u hold the button on their back down. Either way the real characters (him and the other kids def noticed right away) or not I'm super happy with my purchase \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

He plays with these things on a regular basis and was super impressed by the cool light feature you get when you press the button on the back of each figure.Three things you should know before you order: First, these figures are not fully articulated but have basic points of articulation at the neck, shoulders, and hips. My son couldn\u2019t care less that their waists, wrists, elbows, ankles, and knees don\u2019t move. He says it makes them even more believable as animatronics! Second, we have had these about three months and a couple of them have small scratches on the surface paint, showing the base color underneath. Considering the hours of play he has put on them, the scratches are minimal. When I pointed them out to him, he rebutted, \u201cFNAF animatronics aren\u2019t supposed to look brand new. They\u2019re supposed to look worn and torn!\u201d Third, these aren\u2019t licensed toys, so if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, keep on looking! My child is pretty picky when it comes to brand name products and has licensed versions of all of these characters but these are still his go-to for play (and even display)! An excellent deal for the price, and FNAF fan approved. 5 stars!",
