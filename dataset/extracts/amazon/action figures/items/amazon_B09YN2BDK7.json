                "reviewText": "If you're a fan of Stranger Things like me, then the Bandai Stranger Things Eddie Hawkins Figure Collection is an absolute must-have for your collection! I recently purchased this 6\" figure and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.First of all, the attention to detail on this figure is truly remarkable. From Eddie Hawkins' iconic costume to his perfectly sculpted facial features, it's clear that Bandai has put a lot of effort into recreating this character. The paint job is flawless and the figure feels incredibly solid and well-made.What really sets this figure apart from others is the number of accessories it comes with. Eddie Hawkins is equipped with a walkie-talkie, flashlight, and even a miniature copy of his beloved Dungeons & Dragons game. These accessories add an extra layer of authenticity and allow for endless display possibilities.The articulation on this figure is also top-notch. It has multiple points of articulation, allowing you to pose Eddie Hawkins in various dynamic positions. Whether you want him to be battling the Demogorgon or just casually standing with the rest of your Stranger Things collection, the possibilities are endless.Another aspect worth mentioning is the packaging. The figure comes in a beautifully designed box that is sturdy and collector-friendly. It includes a window display, which allows you to showcase the figure without having to open the box. This is perfect for those who prefer to keep their collectibles in pristine condition.In terms of price, I believe this figure offers great value for money. It's reasonably priced considering the quality and attention to detail it offers. Furthermore, Bandai is a reputable brand known for producing high-quality collectibles, so you can trust that you're getting a product that will stand the test of time.Overall, I couldn't be happier with the Bandai Stranger Things Eddie Hawkins Figure Collection. It's a fantastic addition to any Stranger Things fan's collection and is sure to impress both avid collectors and casual fans alike. If you're a fan of the show, don't hesitate to add this figure to your collection \u2013 you won't be disappointed!",
