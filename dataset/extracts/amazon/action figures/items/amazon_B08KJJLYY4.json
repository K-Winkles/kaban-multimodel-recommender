                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars His training may be complete, but this Jedi Luke is suited more for display than play.",
                "reviewText": "The removable lightsaber accessory that comes with it not withstanding, this hard-plastic \"toy\" is much closer to being a figurine primarily designed only for display than an actual action figure for play. The figure's articulation is limited to his two arms that can be rotated up or down at the shoulders. Unfortunately, there are no other moving parts on this figure. That limitation aside, the sculpt and colors used for the figure are attractive. Although the head and face details are not a perfect likeness of actor Mark Hamill, they are decent and generally much better than what I have often seen depicted on many other earlier Luke figures. The black outfit worn by the figure as part of its mold has a subtle sheen, evoking the image of a form-fitting leather body suit clinging tightly to the character's lean toned body. The long green-bladed lightsaber accessory that can be held by the figure only in his gloved right hand is the finishing touch that really seals the deal for this collectible. When viewed from certain angles in relation to a light source, the green blade appears to be illuminated from within as if it were part of a genuine working lightsaber. For whatever reason, Hasbro produced this figure at the unusual scale of 9.5 inches, so it is not compatible with any of the more common 3.75\"-scale, 6\"-scale, or 12\"-scale Star Wars action figures. The only other 9.5\"-scale figure from this line that I could find currently available was Darth Vader, so I purchased him also at the same time. These two character figures are companion pieces that really should have been packaged together readily enabling the recreation of their famous duel from the film Return of the Jedi. For this reason, if you are planning on presenting this Jedi Luke figure as a gift for someone, then do the intended recipient a favor by also including the Vader figure with it, especially for a child who will need to have at least two characters for interacting with one another in any play scenario. Because I, admittedly, am a sucker for nearly any toy and/or visual representation of Luke wearing some variation of his black Jedi outfit, I gave this figure what is perhaps a slightly-inflated overall rating of four stars, but he does look really good exhibited on my nightstand with his big iconic green lightsaber. I imagine that all other fans of Jedi Luke would likewise greatly appreciate and enjoy having the opportunity to display this figure somewhere close to them.",
