                "reviewText": "As a child, I was completely addicted to Ghouls N' Ghosts on the Sega Megadrive and was really excited to see Goodsmile tackling Arthur in Nendoroid form. I did hesitate when I saw this though, as I already have Union Creative's Arthur and to avoid clutter, I usually only like one representation of a character in my collection. I couldn't resist once he dropped to $50 though and I'm so glad I picked him up!Though I have him displayed very simply in my collection, he does come with some really fun accessories, like the blue flame attack, dagger and treasure chest. His mouth articulates a little too which is so cute.I'm usually not a fan of cute, simplistic or chibi style figures (cannot stand Funko Pops or Youtooz for example) but the Nendoroid designers make these like they actually care for the franchises and it shows.",
