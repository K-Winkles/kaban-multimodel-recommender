The side compartments come down but it can really only fit Chase\u2019s vehicle. I bought the rest of the team separately but none of them fit inside so storing them together was out of the question. The Chase that comes with it doesn\u2019t light up like the one sold separately so if you buy them separately I\u2019d suggest getting Chase too.",
