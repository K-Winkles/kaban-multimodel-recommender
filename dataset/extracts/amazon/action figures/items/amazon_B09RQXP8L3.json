They LOVE Spiderman and when I saw the Spiderman and friends characters for 12 inches I grabbed them all. I was originally looking at the older kiddo action figures that are scarier so this was perfect for my kids ages. The size is perfect so I don\u2019t have to worry about choking hazards too. I\u2019m hoping they come out with a doc ock and other villains like Rhino before Christmas I cannot wait for them to open them on Christmas morning. They are going to be so excited!!! The colors are bright and match the tv show Spiderman and friends perfectly. I don\u2019t know about performance yet as we are waiting until Christmas to open them but I scanned it over as best as I could without opening it and didn\u2019t see any damages. Im excited for my boys to play with these.",
