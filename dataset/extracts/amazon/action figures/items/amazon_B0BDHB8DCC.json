He has the Stalker hips and upper legs. But his knees and lower legs and boots might be new? The lace up boots seem higher than others in the line.Paintwork is excellent and there is plenty of it. Most distinct is his weathered leather bomber jacket, which also has individual markings for his medals and ribbons, his wings, his name plate, an American Flag on his Left shoulder and a GI Joe logo on his right. He has a removable helmet with gold star. 2 pairs of goggles with silver lenses. One for stowing on the helmet, one for wearing. His belt has some silver and gold paint work. His pants have a camo print and you can see the collar of his khaki uniform shirt with his gold generals stars beneath his jacket. Plus his delightful hair. Brown streaked with grey. A weathered warrior.Additionally he comes with 2 pistols. One in a shoulder holster one at the hip. A grenade launcher with shoulder strap, and the same shotgun Covergirl came with. Plus the 2 pairs of goggles.I would consider him a Must Have figure for GI Joe collectors. And a useful to have one for other collectors such as Marvel Legends. He's a nice well decked out General. Great for Hulk Hunting.",

                "reviewText": "I like the figure overall; and as I've stated before, I wish Hasbro would come out with the original Adventure Team in this figure; so far, only the GI Joe Club did a variation, in 3 3/4 size, and Hasbro shut them down for their own reasons, none of which had to do with quality. I used to be totally against smaller figures, since when I was a little boy I had the 1/6 scale. But in t his case, I like this 1/12 size figure.My only concern is whether the joints can hold up to bending without breaking, especially in the hands of a boy or girl too young to understand what might happen. In my case, the right arm, which has that very nice double-joint so you can bend the arm enough that it goes way beyond 90 degrees, is so stiff, I'm afraid to \"flex\" the elbow in fear of it snapping; not without first heating it up (either a hair blower or hot water from the tap), that may be the answer for an adult collector. Otherwise, the figure is really nice, with great detail. I really like how the box it came in has its own little cardboard \"footlocker\" of sorts, where you can store the figures weapons and equipment while not in use. You simply put it, as well as the \"coffin-style\" box the Joe is in when delivered, back inside the outer box for a convenient way to store them. The outer box has very nice graphics depicting the Joe inside, and some of his equipment and weapons. Nice.",
