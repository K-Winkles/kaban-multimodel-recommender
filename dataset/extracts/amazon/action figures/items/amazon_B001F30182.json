                "reviewText": "I am impressed with this figure. The sculpt is great, the paint for all the silver (there's a lot of silver) and the red eyes and chest lights are well done, and the figure's joints have more swivel points than I thought possible. The forearm swivels separately from the elbow, and the wrist joints swivel separately from the forearms. The knees swivel separately from the thighs and calves too. The wrist pegs are at the wrist joint itself, can swivel all the way up and down, and they feel a bit fragile. If you go really twisting around on the hands you could damage them. I popped the hands off and moved the pegs up and down to break them in. The chest overlay floats pretty freely and doesn't get in the way, but it almost floats a little too freely and likes to settle at awkward angles. The shoulder pauldrons are hinged to the chest overlay and they move separately from tbe overlay. I was surprised at how short the figure is. It is not really any taller than the standard stormtrooper, and it blends in pretty easily compared to the KX series droid (it stands a lot easier too).The figure comes with its blaster rifle, two fists, an open left hand and a trigger right hand, and two jet effects that plug into the heels of the feet. The jet effects are ball pegs instead of standard pegs. They plug in very easily and are compatible with Mandalorian jetpacks, even beskar Din Djarin's jetpack.I like the figure but I am no fan of the price point. I am not a big fan of army building droids anyways, and that price point really hurts. Two is enough for me, at least for now.",
