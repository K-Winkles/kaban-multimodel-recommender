Amazon did great as they sent a second package. The second package was still missing instructions and some pieces, I had to use first package instructions and combine parts and pieces. Instructions are 90% clear. There were a few missing steps (it literally it jumped from step 6 at the end of page 1 and resume at Step 10 on the other side). Somehow I was still able to put it together based on the picture itself. Overall the toy is not bad, but always could be better. Note to people buying for the first time, these toys require time to assemble, they are very small, so assembling tiny pieces can be an art of patience.",
