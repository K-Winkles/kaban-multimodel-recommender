                "reviewText": "Originally, we'd planned to repaint this guy or make him some clothes or something, but then life got in the way and he's still nude. But my dad seems to find that VERY amusing and loves to prank the rest of the family with the Naked Man action figure. It's not unusual to find Naked Man in the pantry, sobbing nudely in despair next to the canned fish...It's a pretty good figure, oddness aside! lol. He's VERY posable - almost as much as the Marvel Legends figures - which is awesome. But he's also very delicate and you need to put him into poses slowly, with a gentle hand, because his parts are prone to pop out. His chest dislodged itself from his abs just taking him out of his box!He comes with different hands, some extra neck pegs, a handgun, and a pair of shoes. I want to give him five stars, but they're asking for nearly $30 for Naked Man and that's a bit steep for what he is. The average for Marvel Legends figures is around $25 and those are fully painted and have clothes other than shoes lol.",

Every single joint on him can move.And he even comes with replacement feet and hands!The figure has good tension in the internal stringing, so if you pose him, he can stand and hold pretty much any stance all by himself. I had a lot of fun making him do Tae Kwon Do forms and Arthurian knight poses.If you like to draw, it might be useful to have a muscled figurine like this to use as a small reference for the whole body.It should be noted however, that the joints on the hands are more fragile than they appear, and can be slightly chipped if you rotate them too roughly.I'd recommend this to younger adults and older collectors who like cool action figures and wanted a blank slate to customize.",

I like that it comes with both bare feet and booted feet, as well as 3 different sets of hands, not to mention a pistol accessory. There is enough detail here that I can see this used as a better quality artist's mannequin for a drawing reference. It's also just a lot of fun. This one is even well enough made and articulated that as you see in my photos, it can stand on its own without support (clothing for reference; these are not included).For around $27, this is a good value.",

                "reviewText": "This 6\" action figure blank comes with a nice selection of extra hands, booted feet, and a small weapon. It scales nicely with other 1/12 scale figures and accessories. Figure is typically \"buff\" (nobody makes a \"dad bod\" action figure!), and is molded in a nice flesh colored PVC that is relatively accurate for a skin tone. I wish the head/face/hair had more paint detail, but in all honesty, I will probably just use the body and swap the head from another similar figure, though the head and face could be painted. For less than 30 bucks, it's a nice quality figure that could be used by artists for model drawing, kids for playing with other 6\" figures and accessories, or toy collectors/photographers.",

                "reviewText": "This male action figure is great for practicing poses on, or using as a reference. He has a lot of articulation and snaps together easily. Like most action figures, his body is not terribly realistic unless you are body builder ready to enter a competition. He comes with shoes and a various hands. You can also change his height at the ankles by using smaller included pegs. Here we see Jean doing yoga as best he can. It's OK if you topple over Jean! Just begin again!",
