                "reviewText": "wow. the figure is great im surprised i have not seen it in other collections. definitely a smaller fig but not THAT small. its perfect for collectors or people who like to have figs because its in perfect condition. the box is in perfect condition too, the only thing id say this figure needs is more accessories, like blade effects or more hands, maybe a broken sword or maybe the sword of hope. other than that its perfect, if you can i definitely recommend buying \ud83d\udc4d",
