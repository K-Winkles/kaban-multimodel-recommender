Die Figuren sind optisch ansprechend gestaltet, und die Bemalung ist wirklich gut umgesetzt. Die M\u00f6glichkeit, die Figuren vollst\u00e4ndig zu bewegen, erm\u00f6glicht spannende Rollenspiele.Das mitgelieferte Zubeh\u00f6r ist vielf\u00e4ltig, jedoch manchmal etwas schwer anzulegen. Dies k\u00f6nnte f\u00fcr Kinder ab 4 Jahren eine kleine Herausforderung darstellen. Dennoch \u00fcberzeugt das Set insgesamt durch eine hervorragende Preis-Leistung. F\u00fcr Batman-Fans ist dieses Spielzeug definitiv eine Empfehlung wert!",
