Over all the figure is nice, but he\u2019s hard to stand because of the feet. The glasses stay on nicely which was a big surprise.If you already have the first Grey Hulk, you don\u2019t NEED this set, but I will say that this one looks a lot better.",

                "reviewText": "Unhappy with the price point of Marvel Legends currently, but I think the price point is just about right on this two pack. I love this Hulk figure. A great piece for the collection. Heavy like you\u2019d expect the Hulk to be. Great articulation on him. Banner is a nice inclusion but could have used some extra accessories. Maybe a head with an open mouth or yelling, a clipboard, etc. Overall, very happy with this pack.",

                "reviewText": "This is an awesome two pack for collectors that have yet obtained the retro Grey Hulk. Not sure if this is the same body mold as the previous one but the detail is definitely a lot better. It also comes with a second head sculpt which is great. It also comes with four interchangeable hands and one weapon. I definitely recommend this figure for collectors; new and old. Sale or not, the Hulk figure alone is pretty much worth it. The Bruce Banner figure is also great. I do wish it came with some extra hands or maybe some lab cylinders like the retro Lizard figure from the Retro Spider-Man wave.",
