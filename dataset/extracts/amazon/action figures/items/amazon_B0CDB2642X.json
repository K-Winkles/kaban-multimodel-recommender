He had a sword and sheith, and it was just a really detailed figure. They even got the scars right! After i opened it, i realized that it was good but it wasnt as good as i thought it would be... His wrist and elbow articulation was really good! But his cloak made it hard for his shoulders to move (kinda). I cant believe they even put a sheith! But when i put his sword through the sheith, it had to go through the CLOAK. So, when i took it out, it was kinda bent. His knees and waist articulation was just awesome, but his ankles were kinda wobbly. So, it was a pretty good toy OVERALL, but think before you buy it. Because if youre gonna move it a lot and articulate it, it may not be your dream toy.",
