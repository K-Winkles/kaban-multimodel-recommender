                "reviewText": "A lot of toy companies are doing amazing thing, but no one is doing what Jada Toys is doing with their Street Fighter 2 line.Sculpt: 10/10Articulation: 10/10Value: 10/10This is the best Ryu action figure we've ever gotten. I love the sculpt which is a hybrid of classic SF2 art and inspiration from SF5. While I would have preferred that it was more vintage inspired, I can live with some of the modern deco updates (i.e: red gloves instead of brown. and a slimmer build). Of all the Ryu figures that has been made, I do prefer Jada's take the best. The portrait is phenomenal does its best trying to capture the look from the in-game select menu.Perhaps the most superior thing about Jada's Ryu is its articulation. For once, we're able to hit just about every one of Ryu's iconic game sprites. The attention to articulation engineering is masterful and you can tell serious love was put into it. The gi is also made out of an incredibly soft flexible plastic that doesn't hinder waist and torso articulation. From the hurricane kick, Hadoken to the Shoryuken, Ryu can do them all! The joints might feel a bit stiff at first, but once you break it in they are purposeful and smooth.In terms of value, you're getting a once in a life time, end all be all, Ryu figure along with Hadoken hands, a fireball and fireball stand, and an angry screaming head for $27 and some change after tax. Could there have been more accessories? Probably? But we have all the essentials and I am more than satisfied with the pack out.If you're a SF2 fan or just a figure fan, Ryu is a must get along with Jada's entire SF2 line up. The figure is hand candy and I will be all in with this line as long as the same craftsmanship and love continues with it.",

The most important part is - the seller contacted me and gave me a heads up that my package will be a bit late, I appreciate that, I like the fact that they also monitor and tracking the deliver.About the item itself; The item arrived in a perfect condition. As described on the picture. Not a single damage or tear or rip on the package. As a collector I prefer keep my action figures in packages, they preserve well. Basically, Well done to the seller! Definitely recommend!",
