Next I got Bobby and Uni, also great. Then Diana (acrobat) she is so cool and her accessories are great. Sheila is the one I've been super looking forward to the most (fellow redhead) anyway she is just not made as well. Her feet are wonky and you cannot make her stand (at all) on her own. Maybe it is just mine? Anyway I am still happy to have her and to have this collection. Next up, Eric and Presto.",

Sheila a mi gusto es la mejor! el peor es Hank :( esta linea se ve buen\u00edsima en la estanter\u00eda, pero como figuras de acci\u00f3n son malisimas, la calidad deja mucho que desear, las articulaciones son p\u00e9simas y accesorios pobres... sin cabeza extra, manos, u otra cosa que valga la pena, si realmente sos fan de la caricatura aprovecha pero no pagues mas de 25 por cada una, aun as\u00ed es demasiado para estas figuras, para concluir, estoy contento de tenerlas, de ni\u00f1o esperaba con ansias el s\u00e1bado para ver la caricatura y ahora de adulto veo uno que otro episodio con mis hijos, eso es agradable, saludos!",
