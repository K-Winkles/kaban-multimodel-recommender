The details are very nice from the hands to the head sculpt. Everything is very spot on and accurate to what you\u2019d expect from a figuarts product.Although I do have a few gripes about this Goku Black figure. I\u2019m not a fan of the pearlescent coat that\u2019s on the figure, looks very tacky. Also in the Amazon listing you can see the colors are very different from the actual figure. Would of much preferred the colors shown in the images. I know this is a reissue from sh figuarts but still worth pointing out.My biggest issue with this figure is the range of articulation in the legs. First of all when I first unboxed the figure I noticed the left leg was very loose and wasn\u2019t long till it popped off and will not properly pop back into place. Not sure if I got a lemon but after seeing other reviews of what this figure\u2019s articulation is really capable of, it really seemed off to me.All and all the figure is nice but may have some flaws to be found. Would still totally recommend it for how much value you get. Especially for an official figuarts product. Enjoy.",

Goku black is on of my favorite characters anyways! The box came in perfect condition and I really suggest getting it. Notice it is for posing and stop motion not for throwing around and horse playing with it. I\u2019ve seen too many reviews about \u201cI GaVe tHiS tO mY 3 yEAr olD AnD iT BroKE!!\u201d Yea that\u2019s because it\u2019s for 15+. Even if your 12 or thirteen years old you should still be able to use it to its extent if you are carful. So yes buy this item if you are thinking about it!!",
