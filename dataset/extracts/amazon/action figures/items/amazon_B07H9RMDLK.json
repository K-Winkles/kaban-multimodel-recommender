The weapon is fun to play with when he is fighting other guys. I bought this with my own money so I was very glad it wasn't very expensive. Some of them are very expensive. This looks very realistic but not for a lot of money so I think it is five stars. My little brother also says it is a very cool figure.",

Like, it just popped. Off. No worries, I said, we can just pop it back on, right? Not right. Like some weirdness that defied all of the laws of physics, the leg simply refused to attach. I had to make up something fast to avert a major meltdown and preserve my reputation. This was Black Panther Amputee. A special version to teach kids about living without one of their limbs. Very rare. Did my young friend believe me? No. But he appreciated my effort, and black Panther Amputee resides in his special superhero box, sans leg.",
