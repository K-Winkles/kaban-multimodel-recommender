                "reviewText": "Ello Asty is a Resistance X-Wing Pilot. To clear confusion for some people, the \"Resistance\" is to this new trilogy what the \"Rebels\" are to the original trilogy. He is the first non-human X-Wing pilot that has been issued. As with all The Force Awakens Figures, he comes on a really beautiful card back that pictures the character in stunning detail. This Ello Asty figure has very clean paint apps. The aurabesh & other symbols on the helmet are clear & legible. He also has 5 points of articulation (if you want more than 5 POA then, you are going to have to buy TFA Black Series 3 3/4\" or 6\" figures). Also, the pilot helmet is non-removable. To be honest, my figure is going to be sitting in an X-Wing so, he won't need more than 5POA or a removable helmet. Asty does come with a hand blaster. Each hand holds the blaster snugly. He has a working holster which this blaster fits in nicely. In addition, he comes with a build a weapon piece. It doesn't add or subtract anything from the figure. You need the Snow Mission SnowTrooper & StormTrooper to complete the BAW piece. I wish a figure stand would have been included even though, he stands fine without it.All in all, he's a great figure. The card back is really well done. Amazon shipped him quickly & the card back wasn't damaged in any way.",

Asty is one of the cooler ones- what he lacks in posability, he makes up for by being a well-sculpted, detailed figure. I wish his visor were translucent- the solid visor looks a bit cheesey. The ski-backpack combining accessory piece is a bit odd, but has more play value than some that come with other figures. He also comes with a small blaster pistol, which fits in his holster.",
