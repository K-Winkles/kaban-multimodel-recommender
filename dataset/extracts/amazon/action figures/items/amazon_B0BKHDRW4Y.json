For the most part, it's pretty basic but this is what Sandman looks like for the most part. It comes with 3 sets of hands, two standard size pairs and one large pair which I have taken pictures of. It is also entirely pinless which is surprising but totally a positive. I will be honest, it's a great figure but it's not worth the full price. I highly recommend a sale unless you need to complete the wave.",
