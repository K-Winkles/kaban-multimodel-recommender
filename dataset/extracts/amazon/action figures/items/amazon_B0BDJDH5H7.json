Knee and elbow articulation would be nice, but it can't stand on it's own, while holding a 4\" figure in one hand...and all for twenty bucks?!? Their have been better sentinel figures in the past, but bang for buck, this is the best. Does everything you want it to do, and is cheap enough for me to impulse buy another one. If you were a robot-kid, and a x-men fan, grab this. 5/5",
