It is considered a deluxe figure because it has a couple of extra accessories. Hasbro, give me a break!! They price these things out of the range for kids but they don't realize that adults do not make one a priority! It's no wonder they had to lay off half the company. I waited until it was on sale for $14 on Amazon and even that was pushing it.",

The cloth cape is nice to have as I think it won't restrict the figure when it comes to posing. You can use the two storm trooper helmets as heads on other figures if you want so that's kind of nice. At the time I purchased this the price had come down from the original price and that made me pull the trigger and made this a better value.",
