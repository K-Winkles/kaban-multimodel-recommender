                "reviewText": "For a $9 \u201cposable 3-D printed robot\u201d action figure, it\u2019s really not that bad. Some of the reviews I\u2019ve read state that it doesn\u2019t come with the instructions so I put a picture of the instructions in the review hopefully that helps. I live in the north eastern USA so when I got delivered, it was out in the cold for at least 12 hours which I\u2019m assuming some of these reviews that say it broke upon assembly might\u2019ve suffered the same fate. so when I opened it up, I put it in a bowl of warm water to loosen up the plastic and I was able to put it together without anything breaking. I highly recommend laying out all the armor pieces first and getting a general idea of what the figure looks like And then pull out all the joint pieces and separate them accordingly. Put the head and torso together first followed by the legs and then the arms and voil\u00e0. They have it take about three weeks or so to get here cause I\u2019m assuming it came from China. But like I said, for $9 it\u2019s a pretty cool little action figure",
