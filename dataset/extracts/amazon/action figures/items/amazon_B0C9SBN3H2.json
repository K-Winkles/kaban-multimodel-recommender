                "reviewText": "Forest & Twelfth have really found a pattern they like, seeing as every one of their transforming animals uses basically the same transformation with minor changes to how various parts are hidden. This results in a number of hilariously flawed robots with questionable design choices, but frankly I don't much care about that. These bots are full of character, and their animal forms have a far more animalistic shape than a good chunk of the classic Beast Wars models managed. It's debatable whether they're really worth an average of $15, but when you take into consideration that Hasbro's offerings in a similar size category run upwards of $25 the disparity seems fair. Definitely looking forward to expanding my collection of \"deformers,\" if only because just trying to make them stand up and look presentable is comedically difficult.",
