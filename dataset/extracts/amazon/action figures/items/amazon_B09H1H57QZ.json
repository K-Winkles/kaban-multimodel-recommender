                "reviewText": "The Legacy line takes old figures that we (used) to know and love and spins them in a modern yet simple \u201ctransformation\u201d. (Get it?)This specific example of the Legacy line takes Knock Out from the Transformers Prime and gives him a simpler, sturdier, yet slightly blocky proportions of a remolded Studio Series 86 Jazz. As a result he remains slightly stocky but well poseable due to modern manufacturing techniques vastly improving playability of toys nowadays.This works in Knock Out\u2019s favor, as the original release has slightly looser shoulder pivots and issues with how flimsy the back glass backpack was. Not only does it result in a sturdier feeling robot mode, but a fantastically solid brick of a vehicle mode. Transformation is still fun and easy, but sturdy enough that you won\u2019t rip off the backpack\u2019s hinges, since the windshield was thin and molded of mostly clear/translucent plastic on previous iterations of both G2 Jazz from Studio Series 86 and the \u201clatest\u201d release of G2 recolored Jazz from Legacy in his new orange paint job.You really can\u2019t go wrong with picking this figure up. He has customizable weaponry, either getting a spear or a gun, or even a wrist mounted blade depending on how you want to configure them. He\u2019s got a solid (and I mean it) vehicle mode that rolls very well, and the figure itself often goes on sales well below its original MSRP of $24.99 (before tax).All in all, he\u2019s a solid addition to your collection and a bargain if you shop wisely.",
