                "reviewText": "He\u2019s extremely well articulated for only being around 6 inches, I think he has 16 points of articulation with is crazy tbh. The sculpt is amazing as well, there\u2019s a surprising amount of detail for how little detail he has in the movie, he comes with two sets of hands, the default ones have their own unique sculpt, instead of just the same one mirrored, and the other set has the same sculpt, but their fists so it makes sense. Paint job is good, though I assume most of him is unpainted since he is mostly just white. The paint job on the miles bits that come with him are great as well, the lines on his face mask are crisp, while the palms of his hands look airbrushed just like the movie, he also even has that carbon fiber suit texture. There was a lot of detail put into this, even the accessories are super detailed. I see no flaws in this and I would definitely recommend. Totally worth the price.",

He's just so much fun to take photos of because of the amount of joints and movement range!! I feel like yes they could have given him more hand options probably, but I really enjoy this figure and can't help but take him to every scenic place I go to for some cute pictures.

This one is no different, but compared solely to other Marvel Legends, the limbs are very thin and the sculpt is odd - though accurate to the film. The joints feel like they \"could\" become weaker with repeated play, but haven't so far. All in all, it's a good version of The Spot. I just with they'd made it a little more sturdy feeling.",
