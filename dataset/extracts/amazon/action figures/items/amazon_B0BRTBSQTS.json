The toy seems pretty durable. As a car alone, it would be a good toy. But with the shooting projectile, it\u2019s awesome! A definite hit!!!",

                "reviewText": "Two nitpicky on this.First, the lesser. Paper villains? Really?Ok so, this can actually be taken as Spinmaster being really cheap, or, hey Spinmaster was cool to add a couple extra villains; even if they are paper/cardboard. One way ids a negative, the other a bit more positive.The second matters to only retailers and collectors. And that is the retail box it comes in. If this is a gift that will be opened by a kid (regardless of age) then it's not a problem. If you are a collector, you already know this has been a problem the past several plus years. Rather than enclosing the entire Batmobile, they leave it open (to collect dust) and impossible to stack; leaving retailers to wonder how to effectively stack a pile of them, and collectors unable to display it properly.To deal with the dust issue, Spinmaster did wrap the Batmobile in plastic, so, that was kind of nice.My sole purpose to even bring this up, is the hopes Hasbro, Mattel, Spinmaster and even McFarlane read these reviews and realize the three pennies they save is annoying to collecters.As far as the Bat mobile itself goes, its not really any kind of a super upgrade from anything we've had in the past decade, really. But, WARNING! it is the first Batmobile that I recall having a projectile since the first Batmobile Mattel produce some 20 years ago. So, please, don't give this to a bratty or clumsy child who will use it as a weapon or hurt themselves.No point in grading paint. Its the usual paint job.Displayability: in box 60/100. Because of all the suffocation warnings, the plastic does not help the display much, but does help with dust control.Fun Factor: 90/100. Its the Batmobile, its fun to play with, of course!Collectibility factor: 85/100. Of course, time and desirability will be the ultimate judge here. Its large, so unless you're me, and can find more spaces in your house to display things, then space will be an issue. But, if you collect Batman, and make room for these things, oh yeah. Who can't live without another Batmobile? I couldn'tRecommendation: 90/100. Especially if you get an excellent price, I recommend this. Even if you don't its still a cool Batmobile.",
