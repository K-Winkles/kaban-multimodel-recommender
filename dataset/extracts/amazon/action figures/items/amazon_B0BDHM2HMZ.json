                "reviewText": "I got grunt along with LowLight and Tunnel Rat. I fully expected Grunt to be the weakest of the 3. Boy was I wrong. He's fantastic.While he basically uses Stalkers body with a rubber Plate Carrier armor overlay, it looks good. He has amazing detail He comes with 2 rifles which attach to his backpack. A NATO issue M=16 classic weapon and the official GI Joe Laser Rifle from the Sunbow Cartoon. His loadout includes a knife and what I assume is his Gameboy 3Ds strapped to his chest so he can find pokemon on his long marches.And Grunt include an extra head. A game changing piece. A Green and Gold Steele Corp head. This means Grunt is GI Joes forst ever mainline Army Builder. You can have Robert Grunt Graves (Later Lt. Robert Grunt Graves) leading a squad of 2 or 4 non flying Ground Steel Corp squad The only downside is to army build him you need to remove his name tag and dummy up some other name for each.Be warned the Green and Gold Steel Corp Helmet that comes with Grunt does not fit the STeel Corp figures that come in the 2 pack. Nor do those helmets fit Grunt. The Green and Gold STeel Brigade Grunt Helmet does fit the Valaverse Steel Brigade figures..Grunt looks a little dull at first. But you quickly realise that he forms the centerpiece of your GI Joe Team. (Original 13 4evar!)Edit; Just a slightly mild negative followup. I ended up getting 2 more Grunts and an extra Stalker to use as part of my Steel Corps. They look good in a group especially alongside the steel Corp Jetpack 2 pack. I actually like the green fatigue look better than the blue and tan. But the one thing I notice with the 2 latest Grunt figures is I can see that the \"Stalker\" body mold that these figures all use, is starting to show signs of wearing out. The Bicep Rotation Joints on both figures seem to be very gappy and have a hard time staying together. So buyers be warned you may see some gapping at those joints.",

Except the thumbs don\u2019t immediately break off like the original.Paint apps great.The 3/4 helmet felt off because 1) not as detailed as the rest of the gear. 2) it\u2019s a different shade of green than the uniform. But if you think about it, irl those two things are made from different materials so it makes sense. The Steel Brigade/Corps.full face one more than makes up for it.",
