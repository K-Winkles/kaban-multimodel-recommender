I thought that Superman could beat most characters in a battle but my son said he lost to Thor and Black Adam. It was not a quick battle and Superman did his best. He has survived many kicks, punches, and Nerf gun blasts. He has not lost any parts. His cape must be attached well because it has been used to hold on to and fling Superman all over my house. I have not played with this character yet but will update if something changes.",
