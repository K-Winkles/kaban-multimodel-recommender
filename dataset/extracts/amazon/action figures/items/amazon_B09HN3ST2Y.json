                "reviewText": "I love this figure but boy oh boy are Crocmaster's hand and Fiona's joints tight! I needed the hairdryer to soften up a lot of plastic. The sculptwork on both figures is amazing, and the paintwork is top-notch too. Crocmaster comes with a lot of accessories: 2 baby crocodiles, a permanently coiled whip, a hook, his revolver and knife, and Fiona's collar and leash. The collar is permanently attached to the leash, and the leash does have a little flexibility but don't expect anything crazy from it. The collar is extremely tight, and had to be heated up in order to slide over Fiona's head. The knife sheath was also insanely tight, and a flexible plastic knife just wasn't going in there without the hairdryer treatment. Crocmaster's hands weren't opening up for any accessories without that hairdryer either. The baby crocodiles are adorable as heck, and add a bit of cuteness to the set.Fiona has a flexible tail that you can bend just a little bit. The tail's ball socket joint at the base does most of the work. The legs have joints at the base of the body and the feet have forward joints and ankle rockers. The foot joints are super-tight, and once again I had to call on that hairdryer to break them loose. She has a diaphram-like segment that allows for decent forward legs and head movement.I'm really happy with this figure. I had initially planned to pass on it because I don't remember Crocmaster being in the original tv show, but I'm glad I finally decided to buy. Just make sure you use hot water or a hairdryer to help with a lot of tight plastic going on with this set.",

Figure is a good representation of the character. The giant crock is full articulated. My issues was there were not enough items to warrant a deluxe price. I feel they could have included the a few more weapons like his rifle and giant manchette that the venom vs valor version of this figure had . I do recommend picking this up but wait till it is on sale as they are want too much for a figure that does not come with enough accessory's to warrant a deluxe price.",
