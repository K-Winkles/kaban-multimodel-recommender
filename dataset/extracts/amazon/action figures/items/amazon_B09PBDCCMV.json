He fits perfectly in the ship and I'm thrilled to see him happy. We've had this one for a month and so far he's held up great, and he goes everywhere with us.

                "reviewText": "Disney Pixar's first Toy Story film was released in 1995 - which is when lantern-jawed, blue eyed boy Buzz Lightyear first made his appearance. Since then, he's come a long way and starred in his own film and TV series.If this version of Buzz - named after US astronaut Buzz Aldrin - seems a little unfamiliar, as he was to me, that's because he's ventured into prequel territory. This articulated 5\" tall figure represents an early version of Buzz - the XL-03 pilot.For a small figure, this Buzz has considerable play value. Not only are there 12 moveable joints to put him in a range of poses, his helmet and flare gun are removable - and the gun can be placed in his hand or can snap onto his hip. The toy's suggested age range is 4+ which I assume may be because the gun may be swallowed and even the helmet could be put in the mouth.As you'd expect from Mattel, this action figure is well made, superbly detailed and should prove durable whatever adventures he gets taken on. He'll stand up without support so could be displayed effectively too. Well presented and very popular, he'd make the perfect stocking filler for Lightyear fans.",
