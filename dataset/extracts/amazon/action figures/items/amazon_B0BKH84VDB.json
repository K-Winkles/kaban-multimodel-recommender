The only thing I don't love about them is they come with lots of little things (like small slice of pizza, little turtle, and various other small accessories) which are super cute and fun to go with the figurine but will last about 3 seconds in our house and then will be lost forever. My son still loves them though and doesn't even care that he's already lost about half the accessories!",

My son has loved TMNT since watching the original with me on DVD. He has just about every iteration of them. So, when I tried to buy him another set, he said I have those already, I want the Mayhem version because they look different. Ok son, SOLD! He's happy, so I'm happy! Well-constructed. I know because he makes them fight the villains. He loves the accessories and toy weapons that are included also.",

The details are amazing, each TMNT has his own weapon that is detachable and the ninja turtles can either hold it or fasten it to their belts. Very adorable. It was fast shipping and delivered on time. I would buy again as a gift!",
