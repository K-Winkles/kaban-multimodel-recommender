Prince Zuko is the oldest son of Fire Lord Ozai, ruler of the Fire Nation, and the great-grandson of Fire Lord Sozin, who conceived the war. When Prince Zuko was 14, he spoke out against his father and the Fire Nation\u2019s conquest. To teach his insubordinate son a lesson, Fire Lord Ozai forced his son to fight him in a traditional Firebender duel. The Fire Lord defeated his son in front of his royal army, stripped the Prince of his birthright to the throne and banished him from his homeland, telling him the only way he will allow his return is with the Avatar, dead or alive. This is now Prince Zuko\u2019s mission. Each day, Zuko studies Firebending with his Uncle, the Fire Lord\u2019s brother. Zuko is a powerful Firebender for his age and eager to develop his skills. Zuko\u2019s greatest weaknesses are his arrogance and impatience. He believes Firebending is the most dominant art and can never be bested by Water, Earth, or Airbending. Zuko\u2019s teenage overconfidence makes him believe he\u2019s invincible.",

They\u2019re a really good quality and are painted so true to the show. Aang is an incredibly articulated action figure - he can move and shift down to positioning the balls of his feet in a certain way. Good quality, good price, and safely packaged. Highly recommend.",

Tail is somewhat bendable.Overall I am very pleased.4/5 ****",
