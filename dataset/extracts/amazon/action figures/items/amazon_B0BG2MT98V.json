                "reviewText": "I bought these for Classified figures. I had a few figures out (classified, 1 black series, one ML) and the pegs didn't work. The build quality was good. Solid plastic, didn't feel cheap. But the pegs just weren't the right size. Tried a few more figures and I found a couple that worked. Figured I'd write a review for 1 or 2 stars and return them. Decided to check out a few more Marvel Legends figures and got a lot more that worked. Tried multiple bases on figures that worked and they'd always fit that figure. So the build quality and tolerances on these stands is great. It's just the peg hole size consistency between figures is not the same, so some will work and some will not. You could probably sand the peg down or drill out the foot if you felt like putting that much effort in. It appears the peg is metric and US drill bits are imperial so it won't be a perfect fit. I did drill out one foot and wasn't too impressed with the results.",

                "reviewText": "After reading the reviews I was a tad sceptic to buy these. I read the pegs were too big for GI Joe Classified. One guy even said that he drilled out the feet of his figures. I got these anyway because I know how to fix these sorts of issues with Joe stands. That said all of these fit exactly as the are supposed to. All you need to do is press down & lightly twist back & forth a tad & they go right on, no heating required, no drilling, exc. In fact they fit exactly like the stands that come with the Walmart exclusive cardback 6 inch Joes. Because these figures use soft flexible plastic they need the stands to be somewhat tight on the feet. That is just the nature of the beast so to speak. I have to question the motive behind some of these comments because the reality is that these stands are near perfect.",
