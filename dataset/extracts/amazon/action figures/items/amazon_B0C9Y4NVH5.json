I didn't have any trouble swapping hands I know some people have issues with the wrist joint breaking off even in mafex or revoltech figures but If you throw them into hot water for around 30 seconds it will loosen it up. So you wont have such a hard time swapping them.EDIT: 11/03/2023 I decided to try to do some cool poses with it and the arm completely came off and won't comeback on. I am not too disappointed because with KOs it's a gamble on how long they'll last. Unfortunately for me it didn't last too long, will use as fodder for customs or something.",

Also it comes in Japanese or Chinese so instructions are useless .Will I buy this again? No I would not, not for that price maybe for like 10$ it remains me of the one of those toys you get at the swap meet.",
