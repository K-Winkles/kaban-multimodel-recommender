                "reviewText": "My son LOVES these little guys.Devastatingly, a few months ago my son lost his Iron Man character from a single pack set that just contained Iron Man. Searching high and low we could not find the same one anywhere. However, he was included in this excellent set so we pulled the trigger.These little guys are durable! He whips them around not a single broken piece on any of them. They are made of a plastic/rubber material that is bendable, but still hard. We have a <1 year old daughter who plays with these as well and we are never concerned that her little razor sharp teeth will bite a piece off. They are made well.The characters are really cool and cute, and perfect for bringing with in the car. Each character is unique except for the two Ultrons. They are the same mold, just different colors. My son likes the Silver Ultron out of all of them!I would definitely recommend these to any Avenger lovers out there. Great quality little action figures that spur the imagination of boys and girls!",
