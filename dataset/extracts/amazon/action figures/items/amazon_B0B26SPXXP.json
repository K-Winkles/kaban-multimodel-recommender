I've never had the chance to purchase the Marvel Legends version so this was the best opportunity to add one to my collection. The size is very threatening and he towers over everybody as Red Hulk should. The price is reasonable and would be a great gift for any Marvel collector. The only thing I dislike would be the lack of articulation points. However, even with the lack of articulation everything else is near perfect. All in all, I highly recommend this figure because the good definitely outweighs the bad.",

My only disappointment was the condition of the package. Several creases and scratches on the figures package. For collection purposes, this kinda stinks, but I cannot really fault the shipper since they don't know who's getting the item. I won't deduct from the rating and I'm not returning this great looking Red Hulk.",
