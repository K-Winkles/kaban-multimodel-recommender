                "reviewText": "2.5/5 stars (I couldn't give it half)I'm a huge Uncharted fan - game lover, movie apologist - so I had to get this, even though it's pretty clear from the pictures that it's not fantastic, which is DST standard at this point. The articulation scheme was unsurprising, I liked that none of the joints came floppy, all of them were decently stiff without being concerningly so. I'm not one to complain about pins, but when the rest of the scheme is so mediocre, a perk like that would've been nice. The stomach and head movement are of course, limited and dated. Speaking of the head, the sculpt is better in person but still pretty rough. You can tell that there may be something to the sculpt, but it's smothered in the stodgy paint and any resemblance to Holland becomes purely residual by the time it's in your hands. A very pleasant surprise was that the gun is actually removable from the holster, which I'm assuming they couldn't advertise, and it fits nicely in Nate's hand (although mine came out warped to a morbid extent). The other accessories are appropriate, if uninteresting, but end of the day I'm glad they included them. The crosses don't fit well in his hand and they fall out very easily. Still, I wish a sword or something else was included, because $25 for this in 2022 (2023 now) is just rough. If I wasn't such a fan of the IP I wouldn't have bought it at retail, but I think casual fans of the movie may end up pleasantly surprised by this figure at a very steep discount.",
