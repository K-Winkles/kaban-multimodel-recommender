                "reviewText": "For my goals -- a large number (roughly 200) medieval soldiers in different colors of plastic -- which I use unpainted for different armies -- at a very reasonable price, this was almost perfect. It gave me 4 groups of 50 soldiers in blue, white, black and gold at roughly 1/72 scale -- slightly larger than the old 20 mm Airfix soldiers but slightly smaller than more recent ones which run up to 28 mm. The plastic they were made of was more brittle than some, but if used with care (probably better by adults) they should last. They were not on sprue and did not require cutting out. A perfectionist might note a few figures had small holes in their chests, apparently from imperfect casting. I only regret that there were only 8 mounted figures, all roughly 54 mm scale, half black and half silver. These are compatible with similar black and silver mounted soldiers in that scale available elsewhere. My only serious disappointment was that the large, fortified gate was only made of thin cardboard, though there were two very good plastic roughly 1/72 scale two-story towers, with flagged floors, flagged turrets, and open arches permitting soldiers to be placed inside. There were also two tall vaguely Gothic ruins (the only items on sprue) and two walls (assembled from several pieces). In addition, there were several dark plastic rockpiles, almost the height of the 1/72 scale soldiers, and two light grey piles, apparently intended to hold two small green plants.Overall, considering that I usually expect to pay $18 -20 dollars for one roughly 50-piece set of 1/72 figures, or nearly as much for one fort or ruin without figures, I think this is a great bargain.",

The pieces break and snap easily. Even with all these frustrations, my son had fun using his imagination and playing. This set would be a good deal for $5-$10, not $20",

                "reviewText": "I received this toy soldier, castle play set specifically to write a review. That said, I try to be honest and open in all my reviews.(Please see the enclosed pictures.)You get a lot of pieces for your money. If you are just learning how to play miniature games or need some bolstering for your medieval army then this is the perfect set for you.There are towers, rocks, standards, mounted knights and a ton of infantry soldiers.The knights are about three times as big as the infantry, and the units are not evenly distributed by color. These are minor things when you look at the value you get from this set.I used the Warhammer Fantasy Miniature game (early edition) to play a couple of battles with the grandsons, and they were delighted. It was bedtime that intervened and stopped the on-going war.I love this set, and I think that you will too.I give this set my highest recommendation.",
