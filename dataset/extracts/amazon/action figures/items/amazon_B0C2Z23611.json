The figures fits in his hands which is great. They are bigger then the old ones he had (different brand and seller). The figures has joints which I like a lot, you can move and bend thier limbs and waist. My two isses are with the lights and Black Panther's right leg. The figures all have buttons on the back to make thier chest light up, ( you have to hold it to keep it on, it's not on a short timer). Black Panther's light doesn't work at all, Thor's light is very dim verus the other working lights. Blank Panther's right leg came off as soon I took it out of the bag it was in. I popped it back on twice and currently it's on fine but I am worried that it won't last. The little boy playing with them seems to like them but next time I wouldn't get this set again.",
