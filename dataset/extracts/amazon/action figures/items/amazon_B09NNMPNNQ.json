I have an entire wall of Batwing toys, including the new Gold Label McFarlane one. Spin Masters\u2019 design is excellent here, and the new figures are a cool bonus. And, inexpensive, too! This new Batwing toy is one great example of how to make a great toy without breaking your wallet. And the figures will fit in the cockpit, one at a time. It has retractable landing gear, too. Quite a lot of play value here, and for us collectors, it\u2019s a great display piece. Easily five stars! Thanks for reading.",

                "reviewText": "Simple product but nice. Not a lot of detail to be had on the batwing to begin with but I bought this because even though it comes with two 4-in figures, the overall size of this alternate batwing is bigger (and shaped differently) than the original 1989 batwing and scales pretty well with the Batman figures that come with the Jada 1/24 batmobiles, which are just under 3 in. The cockpit is oversized to house one 4-in figure but from the movie we see it can hold three people, one in the front and two in the back, and those 2.75-in figures seem to be about right for this model. Obviously you can't seat those in the Batwing but standing next to it, it seems to be the right scale. So that's basically why I got it and I'm happy with it",

That's why the 4 stars. But I guess therein lies the potential beauty of this model, as it allows me the freedom to add the details that I want, with touch up colors, weathering and adding LED lighting effects. Even though there's a larger version from Spin Master, I actually prefer this smaller version where Batman actually sits properly inside the cockpit. I can't wait to transform this!",
