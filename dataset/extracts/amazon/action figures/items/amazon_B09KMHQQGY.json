                "reviewText": "For fans of the 25th Anniversary revival of GI Joe, one of the great injustices was how many big name characters were only available as convention exclusives. Zartan's evil sister was one of those big name characters who was sadly priced out of reach for most fans because of this. But with GI Joe Classified, Zarana is available at retail for a price that won't bust your bank account.But while beautifully designed and sculpted, the figure has two big problems: Zarana's shoulder pads limit your ability to move her arms up and down, while the character (like Lady Jaye) suffers from the fact that rather than giving her two head sculpts (one with her butch haircut that her original action figure had and one with the more feminine pixie cut that her cartoon and comic counterpart had), Zarana instead has two hair pieces that can be switched out depending on how you want to display her. A shame, as Hasbro has shown willingness to do alternate head sculpts for their Marvel Legends line.But problems aside, it's a really decent figure and a worthy addition for one's GI Joe Classified collection.",
