A shame, then, that the figure is a bit too small compared to the Turtles from the same series. It also doesn\u2019t hold the poses well as the joints are too loose.As a result, my boys play with the Turtles more so than with the Shredder. I\u2019d recommend giving it a miss and perhaps looking for a different \u201cvillain\u201d figure for kids to play with.",
