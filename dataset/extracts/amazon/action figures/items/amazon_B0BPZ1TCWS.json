Dont be fooled by some reviewers that arnt willing to put in minimal effort .This figure pack has nice value, and compliments the line well. also marions hair on mine is soft enough to get some head movement,It hinders a bit but not what I would call \"Hard Plastic\".",

Indiana Jones is already costing $40+ on the secondary market.The Indy is the first to sell/a high demand figure to collect, then the other figures.But you can still get the Indy so far at Hasbropulse online store at the retail price (the Spring of 2023). Act quickly before they are all gone.A Indiana Jones fan since 1981, Joe NY",

FINALLY having a wonderful line of figures obviously crafted by fans of the series is something I have waited for since I was very young, and to share that with my kids, down to the little monkey Marion comes with is truly a joy!",

I do have a 3.75 inch Mutt Williams, her son by the way (spoilers!) but never had his mother as a kid when crystal skull came out in 2008.This action figure has a MONKEEEEY! THE MONKEEYYY! YAAAY! Sorry about that. It also includes her frying pan as her items that came in the box.I can barely move her head because of the hard, plastic black hair in the way, & I had problems trying to get the monkey on her arm like in the movie so I had to put the little boy next to her. I also had trouble trying to get her two hands holding the pan.I wish she had more than two hands and more accessories to her figure\u2026Still a good figure, I highly recommend to fans.",
