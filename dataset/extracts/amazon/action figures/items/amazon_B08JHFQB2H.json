I found this marked down, and as such, it's been a terrific addition to some of our Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes this year, now at the beginning of their journey to make many children unfamiliar with Western expectations and understanding of our rather (!!) materialistic culture. Guaranteed to please in almost any case, I'd think, and definitely good for a chuckle for the uhm...maturing dads attempting to fit in yesteryear's suit! Grin. The only downfall I can see was pointed out by sophomore in HS as he helped pack. \"With all those big muscles, the poor guy can't flex!\" True if you're focusing on the physics of the thing.
