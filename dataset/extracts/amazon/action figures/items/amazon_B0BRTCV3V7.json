                "reviewText": "Wow okay so first review ever but ya this set was stunning. Spinmaster is evolving and redefining themselves ever since the release of their \"The Batman\" movie line. Things just keep getting better.Croc looks amazing. I prefer his more human look but this version is so cool, perfect articulation and very stunning details.Batman looks badass however I feel spinmaster could make arms more muscular for this and even their batfleck version from the flash line. I also find the arms in general have been pretty short and not as proportional as I would prefer with most spinmaster 4inch/3.75 figures.Also the cape could be attached a lil better for this toy as well as for all the spinmaster figures so far. I think Mattel did it better with their Arkham multiverse line but Spinmaster is killing it and I'm so for it!I also want to say that the motorcycle is pretty neat but is overall mediocre but I also don't think any of us collectors/figures fans bought it for that. Still a cool accessory to the collection.",
