                "reviewText": "This Black Series Mandalorian looks great with my Black series Baby Yoda, The Child, Grogu, whatever you want to call \u2018em! He has nice paint on his long rifle and pistol. Which also continues onto his armor! He also is equipped with a soft plastic cape. It is better than some of the older fabric ones and plastic ones because it is controllable and soft. The articulation is good as well! In addition to that, his rifle can be stored on his back, and there is a big enough gap from the back to the cape so it can be stored over the cape. The pistol also has the ability to be stored in a holster. The strap that is meant to close the holster doesn\u2019t work too great when the pistol is in it. One tip I can offer is inserting the pistol half way and then insert the strap peg into the trigger hole then continue to push the pistol in the rest of the way. Make sure the strap is pushed in with the gun. The packaging is the same old same old. Still looks cool though. I highly recommend this for any Star Wars/Mando fan! I bought mine from the seller \u201c707 Street.\u201d It was in excellent condition which is important to most collectors. 10/10 experience!",

I really do like the Black Series products too, reminds me of being a kid in the 90s and getting occasional gifts from my mom of a few action figures from the local Walmart back then or Target or elsewhere, we would travel together and was lots of fun. Once got the X wing with Luke Skywalker Pilot. really miss those days, things were happier then. and there was more hope in life, mostly through ignorance, but there's some hope still and I truly believe things will get better somehow.Right the product. Well, I was thinking about toys in general while looking at it, and thinking about what it means to get a product from a favorite TV show or movie. It's like a living piece of that movie right there with you in your room always. Probably the biggest part of the magic is it was sort of a gateway or key to reliving the magic world you saw in the theaters.",
