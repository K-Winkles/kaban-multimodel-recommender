I wish there was a bundle of the all black circles but the clear ones also work. Highly recommend for any collector who displays their figures.",

I do not like how the circle stands and the rectangle stands are the same cost for half the standing capacity. They sell them by the piece, but when ordering the 56 piece mixed bag, you get 28 pieces of each, but since you need 2 circles per figure, it feels like you get half the standing power with the circle stands. They are more versatile, but a 100% premium seems excessive.",
