Wish more than the soldier was a darker skintone, but at least one is. Its great that that half of them are women. My husband says no one in U.S wears military fatigues in that style anymore. He appreciated that the left arm band American flag on astronaut is in \u201cright direction,\u201d he isn\u2019t sure right wrist one is in correct direction though because it\u2019d be backwards if shaking someone\u2019s hand. Do people shake hands in space? We seriously love these. Such great craftsmanship and attention to detail! Really wish for more diversity though. Only 10% POC?! C\u2019monn",
