Even my old childhood hollow Chewbacca seems more substantial. I guess I might still buy a 12 inch action figure if I live to be 90.There just fun. They look nice on a bookshelf. They're nice to hold in your hands. Very detailed and a decent price.This one is jointed at enough places that really.....it's a great deal. And it's Batman. Not a lot of heft or weight but then I don't have kids who might hit me with it......This is a very nice poseable figure. My 10 year old self would've freaked out....my old self is....kinda close to that. It's good. Joints are kinda loose but....I'm satisfied. It ain't Johnny West quality but nothing is any more.Nice modern toy for the money. I think any Batman fan at any age would like this.",
