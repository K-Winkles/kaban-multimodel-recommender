                "reviewText": "These are really cool figures that have a great feel to them and are a little thicker and more sturdy than the Imaginext characters we pair them with. These have a bit of extra personality in their exaggerated shapes compared to a lot of Imaginext figure that are worthless if the pain on their face wears off. These have a face shape, making them safer to not look scary if the paint comes off with age. These will be among a small batch of my son's toys that I aim to keep in storage if he ever outgrows them. They seem like the sort of toy that will take quite a while to outgrow, considering my son is only three. My only qualm with the Playskool Heros line compared to Imaginext is that the Heros usually come with weapons that do not fully detach unless it's a projectile weapon. This set has zero accessories. The bow and shield remain attached. I can only assume that the lack of accessories was something to keep the age range broad. My son is three and he needs some swords and stuff so he can get them lost in the classic way. These are really cool character to hold though. The feel of them in your hand is gratifying. The Imaginext variety are not sculpted with this level of detail. The packaging has a good feel too, for gifting.",

He plays with them more than the 5in ones or the full size ones (yes we have almost every single one in this brand) were only missing about 3 more to the set which will be buying soon because they are just that great. None have broken. None have given issues -- in any of the sizes. Playskool Heroes are an A+ 5 STAR FROM MY FAMILY.",
