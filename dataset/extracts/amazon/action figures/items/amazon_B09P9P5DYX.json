Tiene mucha m\u00e1s articulaci\u00f3n que las que salieron antes de la Jr Zap Patrol adem\u00e1s de que el esculpido es mucho m\u00e1s proporcionado y tiene muchas m\u00e1s aplicaciones de pintura.Me agrada mucho que hayan mantenido cierta escala, ya que es significativamente mas grande que Izzy Hawthorne, por ejemplo.",

The joints are chunky and offer a good range of posing options. It's definitely a toy that can stand up to being bashed off other figures. It only comes with the spear accessory, but it's pretty cool and fits securely in the figures hand. Recommended for anyone who likes the character.",
