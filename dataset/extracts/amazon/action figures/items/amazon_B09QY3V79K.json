                "reviewText": "I bought this for my kid who loves the Super Mario movie along with Luigi. Both arrived quickly and the quality was great for the price. The ability of the characters to move and the detail in them is what got me to buy them. The nostalgia of seeing them and the movie has gotten me to purchase a few others.My hesitation in these for ages 3+ is the accessory could become a choking hazard. My kid hasn\u2019t been big into putting things in his mouth and is older then 3 suddenly popped the plunger Mario has into his mouth. Luckily I was within feet of them and immediately got it. While I like the figures I wish the accessories that came with them were better thought of and reason why I took a star away from this item.",
