                "reviewText": "I bought these for my son. I figured eight, 6 inch, figures for the price was a steal! Be warned these figures are hard plastic & have very limited articulation. Basically only the heads and arms move. Not ideal for older kids who\u2019d enjoy more sophisticated play. My son is only 3 & often uses his toys as projectiles. So, these are perfect for him. He can hold them easily in his hands, they\u2019re sturdy with little to no moving parts, and other than Captain America\u2019s shield none of them have weapons or removable parts.In short these are great for my 3 year old who loves superheroes, but is too young to play with the more expensive & sophisticated toys that are often more expensive & even collectible.Lastly, I like this set of toys because it features several of marvel\u2019s black characters such as Falcon, War Machine, & Falcon. It also has Spider-Man, & because he\u2019s in costume he could be Miles Morales or Peter Parker depending on child & preference.Overall I happy with the purchase, but only gave it 4/5 stars because it would be nice if some of the characters could turn at the waist & bend at the knees, etc.",
