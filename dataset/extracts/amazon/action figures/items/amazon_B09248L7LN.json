My earliest figure is Rey and Kylo Ren from The Force Awakens up to the current Ahsoka Tano VC 202. These work for the repacked figures as well. I have currently on stands all The Vintage Collection as follows - Luke Skywalker Crait / The Mandalorian / Chewbacca from the Target Millenium Falcon / Bo Katan / The Armorer / Arc Trooper Fives / Arc Trooper Echo / Chirrut Imwe / Tuskan Raider / Captain Phasma / Luminara / Aayla Secura / Battle Droid ETC. These work excellent at keeping the figures up. You do NOT have to put both foot pegs from the character in each stand. I have several characters like Chewbacca from the Target exclusive Millenium Falcon with only 1 foot in the peg and he stands very easily!!!",
