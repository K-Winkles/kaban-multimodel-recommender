Kid and fans can recreate the action from the world of Sonic the Hedgehog with the Death Egg Playset. Sonic faces Dr. Eggman again, but this time inside the Death Egg for an epic battle!

                "reviewText": "This Sonic playset is a dream come true for Sonic fans, but it comes with a few challenges. It arrives in a large, branded box that hints at the adventures inside. Assembling it can be a bit tricky, and the instructions aren't the clearest, making adult assistance essential, especially when putting the rings together. Don't toss aside those gray plastic pieces in the packaging \u2013 they're crucial for building the egg!Once you've conquered the assembly, this playset truly shines. It includes two figures, Sonic and Dr. Eggman, perfect for igniting your child's Sonic passion. The Death Egg's attention to detail is impressive, and it stands as a solid, eye-catching centerpiece. While the track assembly might pose a challenge for a child, it's nothing a bit of teamwork can't solve.This playset's size may surprise you, requiring a larger shelf for display, but the end result is undoubtedly cool. The Death Egg's size is impressive, and its goal is to reach Dr. Eggman's heart \u2013 a thrilling adventure for Sonic enthusiasts. Watching your child play with it is a joy, and it'll keep them entertained for hours.In the end, it's a fantastic addition to any Sonic collection, both as a plaything and a display piece. If you know a Sonic fan, this playset is an ideal gift that will keep the Sonic magic alive in your home.",

You also have to manually switch the direction of the tracks/sonic. The tracks do twist, but I don\u2019t see the reason.

He doesn't really play with toys anymore, so he is displaying this set with his other Sonic figures he collects. It's a lot bigger than I was expecting, so his dad had to add a bigger shelf to place it on, but so worth it, it looks super cool. The death egg shell and tracks were a bit of pain for my son to assemble by himself, but we got it done together. So if you buy this for a child, they will most likely need help building it. The death egg looks amazing, very detailed and it's definitely solid. It comes with two figures, Dr.Eggman and Sonic. The track works great, Sonic runs around it very smoothly. My son loves it, the playset is his new favorite piece to his Sonic collection. Overall very happy with it and would recommend.

                "reviewText": "My son who turned three recently has been into Sonic the Hedgehog for quite some time now. He loves watching him on television and watching me play the video game since he is not old enough yet to play himself. When I saw this pop up in my feed, I knew this would be the perfect gift for him to have the opportunity to play with Sonic.The death egg itself is pretty large. I have a good spot for it in his room and it is pretty awesome. It comes with a little Sonic and the aim is to get to the heart where Dr. Eggman is living. It is a joy to watch him play and it keeps him busy for a good number of hours.",

Gioco difficile da montare (le istruzioni dei giochi di sonic a quanto pare sono tutte scritte male e non intuitive) quindi ho dovuto vedere un video su YouTube per capire dove fosse l'errore, ma anche il ragazzo che faceva la review ha ammesso che \u00e8 un gioco senza senso, soprattutto contando quato costa.Sonic si deve muovere con le mani, ma, solo una delle due \"scie\" funziona (questa \u00e8 una parolona, perch\u00e9 non funziona niente in realt\u00e0) o comunque ci si regge meglio la statuina di sonic. Quando questa arriva in basso, premendo un bottone con difficolt\u00e0 si riesce a toccare un pulsante sotto ad Eggman e finalmente il robot - uovo nel quale si trova, si disassembla. Di un meccanico e poco intuitivo unici! Tra tutti i giochi di sonic l'unico carino \u00e8 davvero funzionante \u00e8 quello di Gian Eggman che si vede sullo sfondo del tavolino. Sconsiglio il gioco. Non metto una stella solo perch\u00e9 i due personaggi all'interno almeno si possono usare per altre avventure di fantasia e mio figlio, per fortuna, ne ha molta quindi li user\u00e0 in altri modi!",
