Some of these were easier to attach than others. I couldn't get the armor/skirt on securely.The helmet is a bit misshapen, it is also flexible material and one side kind of sticks out away from the figure's face.The openings in the right fist is too small to really get the hammer in to, again you will need to wrestle it in to get the figure to hold it even a little. It fell out shortly after the picture was taken, because I was only able to squish it into the hand a tiny bit. The handle for the hammer is thicker than the axe handle. The axe fits in either hand.I can position it in a way where it stands on its own without falling over at least.Some of the joints articulate better than others, the shoulders went more than I wanted while the elbows barely move.Overall I would have to give this a pass, you can buy Marvel branded figures for less than the list price on this that are better made.",

                "reviewText": "This action figure is definitely a heavy duty and sturdy toy! He nearly feels indestructible and quality made. The clothing of the outfit along with accessories all have to be put on him, as he comes without a stitch. Some of the clothing was a tad bit tricky to get on, but once everything was on and assembled it definitely looks like a much more high end toy. While I think this is a great toy to play with and will bring lots of fun and quality- I'm not sure about how you would gift it, as it came in a see through plastic bag within an unmarked cardboard box. It honestly looked as though someone bought this took all the accessories off returned it in and threw into a bag to be re-sold. Otherwise it the item itself is great, just not sure about it being necessarily giftable.",

First thing about this figure is its big, bulky, and has some weight to it. The attachments aren't poorly made, but they don't really work either, like his outfit. It doesn't fit him well. Definitely not like the picture on Amazon. The weapons came bent and the figure was definitely used as it had stains and cuff marks like it had been scraped on the ground, and it was dirty and greasy upon opening.This was intended to be a present for a kid, but no.Not worth it.",
