However if you do buy two you get to unique looks. Win/Win This is a good modern homage to the original cartoon. The inclusion of a second set of hands, and weapons are great considering the other parts. McFarlane take note. At the retail price, Zodak is a good value compared to Marvel Legends or McFarlane from an accessory perspective. It has better articulation than Super7 and SOME NECA and very vibrant. only downside is lack of paint, but acceptable at this price. If you haven't started collecting Masterverse yet, this is a great figure to start.",

Moreover, hers is a simplistic enough design that this figure somehow feels especially well done (in that there weren't many compromises translating her to plastic). It's not a figure that's going to blow your mind, but it's more than just a figure you won't be disappointed to own. Definitely worth picking up if you collect the Masterverse line or need to fill a hole in your Classics collection.",
