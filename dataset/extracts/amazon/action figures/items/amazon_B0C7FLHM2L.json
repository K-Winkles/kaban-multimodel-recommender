My main issue is that there is no mention of Marvel anywhere on the packaging and it actually says SH Figuarts in several places despite not being a Figuarts product. There is poor paint throughout, the color of the plastic and paint change from piece to piece, and the figure feels frail in hand. Spidey is also undersized compared to most 1/12 scale figure lines so he'll seem small in most displays. That said, there are very few figures of Gamerverse Spider-man and the sculpt and articulation on this figure are miles better than what Hasbro put out for Marvel Legends. It includes a ton of accessories and is fun to play with. If you're looking for a fun figure of Gamerverse Spider-man to add to your shelf you could do worse.",
