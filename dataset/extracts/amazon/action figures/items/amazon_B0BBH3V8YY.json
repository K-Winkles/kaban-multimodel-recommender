First, you must take the head off to change out the arms and after the first night of play the head was no longer stable. It would spinning in circles every time my son held it which was frustrating for him. Then within a few days the nose popped off and even after trying to glue it back on with gorilla glue it still would not go back on. I am now in the market for another Shadow character and it's only been 5 days since I bought this one. I will never buy a character like this again. He has a huge collection of sonic characters from all different companies and this is the worst one .",
