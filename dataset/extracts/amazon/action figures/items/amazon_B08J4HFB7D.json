Only thing is it can only be truly enjoyed after you remove the hard rubbery jacket (which isn't easy to remove nor practical). Mattel you should use cloth goods or variations of, you have done good with this before and should always default to clothy materials. Even with that mistake it easily one fo their best female sculpts with great accessories. I do wish a title belt was included just for the pure flare of the figure.",
