                "reviewText": "PROSIt is obviously a high quality toy with a high quality hat. His recordings are from the different movies. His pull string only comes out about 4 or 5 inches, but it comes to a complete stop, so I don't believe anyone will accidentally pull too hard and break or dislodge the string. I love that it will be interactive once we get our grandson Buzz Lightyear for his birthday. After all, that is what the Toy Story movies are all about, the toys talking to each other when no one is playing with them. This toy will be able to withstand years of use because he was built to be durable. His clothing is made from quality material. This was a great gift, a smart gift. My 3 year old grandson LOVES it.CONSIt is ridiculous to get out of the box. It took an intelligent 33 year old man about 10 minutes. He may have been being careful not to rip or ruin the colorful surround that shows as the inside of Woody's box. The box Woody came in did not have a front (clear) protective film over the doll. Woody isn't breakable, so it would have just kept Woody from getting scuffed up or dusty if it was there. There was no name written on the bottom of his boot. But, it does offer the opportunity to put your child's name on there. His hat fits tight and only in one spot, so I see the hat as being easily lost or tossed aside in frustration.CONCLUSIONI love this toy. It is well made, using high quality materials. I heartily recommend purchasing as a gift for ANY child.",

This Buzz quickly came to the rescue and my son is over the moon, bonus he's CHEAPER! He's more interactive, larger and has definitely made my 3 year old much happier. He watched out the window waiting for the delivery van with his new Buzz. Now he's ready for all the characters so he can play \"just like Andy.\" Highly recommend this Buzz over the walmart one anyday!",

                "reviewText": "I spent a lot of time looking at the different Buzz Lightyear toys since 1995 to find the most \"authentic\" one that's not $300 on eBay. This is it! He does pretty much everything in the movie, even better than those $300 ones. Wings with lights, helmet that does the \"whoosh thing,\" laser light and sound, wrist communicator, and his phrases are the actual toy phrases, not lines spoken by the character in the films. No name on the boot. He does the karate chop action, which is cool, but it does make his right arm more difficult to pose, but that's fine. He has the interactive feature where he can talk to other toys, but I don't use it. I really like that Disney stuck to keeping his phrases as the real toy phrases so he doesn't \"break character.\" Best Buzz Lightyear you can get for the money, maybe the best one you can get, period!",

When you pull the string on his back, you can't barely hear his voice lines unless you're in a completely quite place.I wish the speaker would've been a little louder to appreciate the sound and the movie quotes",
