                "reviewText": "Please make sure you understand what you are buying. Some reviewers complain about this being fragile and it can be if in the wrong hands. You need to realize you are buying a collectible to be displayed, not a toy to be played with. Pros: The item itself is very cool! Much attention to detail and easy to assemble. It is a good size scale and makes it easy to display with or without a display case. Cons: Though it is much more affordable than the 1/6 scale version, it is still way overpriced, especially considering it does not have any metal parts. The figure included has no lighting features. The base has lights that are not bright enough and are located under the foot pads so most light is directed to the sides. There are no lights aimed at the figure which pretty much renders the present lighting mute. In a lighted room, the included lighting is useless. In the dark, most of the entire display is left dark and again becomes wasted lighting effort. In summary, very cool to display but needs improvements and definitely over priced.",
