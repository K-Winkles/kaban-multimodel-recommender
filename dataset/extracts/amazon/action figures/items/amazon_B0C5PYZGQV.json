                "reviewText": "Yup, I committed a cardinal sin of opening the package so my daughter could play with him. Shockingly I have opened every one of my Super7 toys so my kids can play with them, and it's always 100% worth it!The packaging is beautiful, it really is a shame to rip it open, but seeing my kids play with toys that I can wish existed back in the 80s, is all worth it.Like all Super7 action figures, the fit and finish on this guy is fantastic. Beautiful colors, no rough edges, etc. As some mentioned, Mr. Bones doesn't move as much as the false articulations might lead you to believe. His arms pivot at the shoulder, his legs pivot at the waist, and his head can turn. Not much but it's enough to make him sit and balance him to stand.It would have been fun if he came with a little red plastic coffin like the candy used to come in, but that nostalgia would have been lost on the kids anyway.Bottom line: fun nostalgic memories for me, something I hadn't thought about in decades, and a weird little skeleton toy for the kids to incorporate into their playtime. Absolutely love all things Super7!",

It would look wonderful on a shelf like that. We however opened ours and our little one loves him. The build and paint are great and it is durable, no issues with a little kid playing with him. I was slightly disappointed with the articulation, and I thought his knees and elbows would bend, but they don\u2019t. I was also hopeful that he could be disassembled and reassembled, as the packaging shows all of his parts disconnected, and floating around. Even those those features would be rad, it doesn\u2019t take away from the fun we have playing with Mr. Bones.",

Mr. Bones is from a nostalgia candy that is no longer made. In candy, it would come in coffin with various colored skeleton parts you could put together. (Of course, there was never enough to make a whole Mr. Bones)Alas! The Mr. Bones Action Figure.While this is far from pulling apart, the look and colors of the original candy is pretty spot on. It is really cool to see a lifelike action figure of a Mr. Bones that will not fall apart. This looks to be slightly articulated. One of the most classic things about Mr. Bones was the heart in the center of the chest and the coffin. The coffin is printed as a picture on the package. This is one of the most randomly great nostalgic toys that you could gift a sibling or friend. Recommend!",
