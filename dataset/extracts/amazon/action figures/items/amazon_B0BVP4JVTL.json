Stands nicely without assistance and holds her arm position well. The flaming torch is a little loose in her hand. It would have been nice to include a green orb with mist as it is in the original artwork. The paint job is clean and good. Her cape is constructed of vinyl.The figure packaging is good with the original artwork on the card face. Now thinking of it, it would have been cool to have the treasure chest included with her too. Oh well!The only problem I have is that when packaged for mailing, a large piece of tape was stuck upon the face of the blister card ... ripping off a portion of the image. If I was a collector wanting it keep it ... I'd be very upset.I hope they continue with this line and create the fighter that's with her.",
