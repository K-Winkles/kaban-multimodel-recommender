                "reviewText": "While browsing, I came across this version of the character, as seen in the streaming show, rather than any of the cinematic movies. This is a great iteration of the character and the sculpt is amazing. I love the details and the overall solidity of this action figure. This is a highly-detailed sculpt, especially for a 3.75 inch figure. I'm pleased with my purchase, even though I wish I didn't have to pay as much. Still, I feel that I got what I paid for, and so I can't complain, no matter how cheap I am. I'd say that this action figure is a great addition to any collector, but it's also suitable for play. The figure has great articulation and no balance/standing issues. I'd say that this one is great for dioramas or display, more than anything. Given the 3.75 inch scale, this take on Obi-Wan is probably fantastic for diorama builders.",

He has a range of accessories such as gun and fold up droid as well as his trusty light sabre for when an old friend comes calling......He also has his old robe which is really neat. The figure is another great sculpt, a far cry from the original kenner/palitoy figures, looking at you, big headed Solo!It's also a super articulated figure meaning in his quiet moments he can do some actual jedi exercises. Very good figure.",
