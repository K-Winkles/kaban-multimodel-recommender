You know ... some toys come with all the pieces in a bag or such like. This was in a box with the accessories nicely displayed beside Superman. To a 9 year old boy, he just wanted to get into that box and play with it from the moment it was opened. I would recommend this item for any child who enjoys the taller 12 inch action figures.",

He said wow, he's never seen this toy before and was happy to receive it as a present. It doesnt have much to it just the action figure, helmet, hammer, and shield. This would be a great present for any younger boy that is into superhero and action figures.",
