                "reviewText": "Kenner, Hasbro, Mattel all made Batcycles, and the Batman figure never quite fit right. Why not?Spinmaster has made one; a bit unusual, but, Batman actually fits and quite nicely. THANK YOU SPINSMASTER!Design: 90/100To me, this is an odd design, with the cloth wings and all; but, then again, it's supposed to be a glider too. (Seriously?) Ok, for a toy, I guess it doesn't have to make sense; just be cool.Well, if nothing else, the wings make for a good kick-stand.Aside from the wings, it's an otherwise cool design.Paint: 90/100Not much really; but, like the figure, it has a contrasting black, matte and gloss to keep it from being too shall we say, boring?Fun-Factor: 91/100I guess it has a fun factor, I would think kids would enjoy. Popping buttons to undo things is usually fun. My Batman didn't flip; I think he's supposed to, so, that may be a detraction. And any kid playing with it, should enjoy crashing it :DDisplayability: 100/100With a 12 inch Batman that actually fits pretty close to the way he's intended, without having to be preinstalled to the cycle, is in and of itself pretty awesome. Most Batcycles are 1/4-1/3 the side of this one, so, with that in mind, it's rather massive. The Batcycle itself is about 15-18 inches long, and about 5-7 inches tall. Like I said, in terms of Batcycles, pretty massive. It will make for a very impressive display piece.Value: 100/100One thing I feared, when I ordered it, being Spinmaster, maybe it would be dull. Like the Flash Batwing. No, this is actually a decent value; esp. when you consider the McFarlane one's are much smaller.Overall: 96/100A little unrealistic, in that even Batman using a motorcycle as a glider; but, it's still pretty cool. No, it's not the same as the Kenner \"Bat\" Batcycle from the 90's, or McFarlane's \"skull\" Batcycle, from a year or so ago; those had it's own unique coolness factor, but, this stands on it's own-- figuratively, and literally. And the retail price is not unreasonable, either.Recommended: YES!",

                "reviewText": "He's the first of the DC dolls I've seen that has full articulation and he looks fantastic on his own. The armor pieces aren't the most sturdy and are definitely difficult to get on even for an adult. Similar to more complex GI Joe and GI Joe adjacent dolls. But aside from a few pieces not wanting to stay on, it all works fine. His accessories can be clipped on in various places allowing for more modular play as well.",

It is presented in a good looking box and is really good value. The Batman figurine is strong and sturdy and was still intact after leaping from an upper story window ( I was assured he was not thrown- he jumped) and landing on concrete. He survived being partially buried in a flowerbed and was still ready to save the world after a good hose down with warm water. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this toy and feel he has more than earned his 5 star review.",
