I still wish it was a little bigger to fit two figures in the cockpit instead if just one, and I wish the rear extended out a bit more. With that being said it still looks really cool and I like it overall.The Storm figure is what brings this purchase together. The fact that she comes included is truly awesome because these days action figure lines don't often include a figure with their vehicles, at least not as much as they did in the 80s. Storm is a good size, a well made figure, and a good quality sculpt.The original price is way to high though ($34.99) and it isn't worth it in my opinion at that price. However I grabbed it at the sale price ($15.83). That is a more than reasonable price and if you can get it for that I say jump at it. A good solid set overall and I am pleased with my purchase.",
