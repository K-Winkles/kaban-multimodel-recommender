I think the real fun for this toy is in some teen or Spiderverse-loving adult changing out parts and then putting them on display and not touching them. I thought it might be fun to swap some out and give to my 4 year old, but I think I'll just hold onto all the parts and give him the basic Miles and let him have fun. If he happens to rip an arm off or something, I'll grab one from the box and throw it on.I'd give it five stars if the pieces were easier to put on. There are a few pieces I'm not sure I could get on with pliers, and the pliers might damage the other plastic. I'm sure I'm doing something wrong, but it didn't come with instructions or best practices for some goober like me. If this is supposed to be some manner of collectors' toy, then my personal one will be worth less as my child plays with it. More's the better for making all of yours worth more. Happy posing!1 Star = Safety Hazard, or Gross misrepresentation of product2 Stars = Needs improvement3 Stars = Meh, likely wouldn't buy again.4 Stars = Meets expectations5 Stars = Exceeds expectations",

It comes with so many interchangeable pieces so that I can give him different movie poses. I can also have him bare foot or with sneakers, and I can switch his face out and put on his mask. This is well worth the money and great for collectors. This will really stand out on my son's shelf.",

It has lots of parts so you can dress up your Spidy to your taste. This includes 6 (yes 6) pairs of hands.On the downside, there are no instructions in this box, so you have to guess on how to remove the parts , and which parts are removable! It was fairly easy to remove the hands, the legs, and even the head. However, the arms were impossible to take off. We didn\u2019t want to break the toy so we didn\u2019t use max force on thinking the arms might not be removable, even though a set of green arms are included which implies you should be able to swap them out!Other than the lack of instructions and difficulty removing the arms, this is a great toy for web-man fans. Just make sure they are old enough so the small parts (hands, head, etc) are not a suffocation hazard for them.",
