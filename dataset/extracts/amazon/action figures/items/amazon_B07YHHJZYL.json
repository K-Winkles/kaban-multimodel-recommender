There is a knife sheath on his right hip, but not a knife (maybe he lost it in a fight). His jacket is removable. His shoulders, elbows and wrists. hips, knees are all moveable. His chest even is able to twist a bit. His head turns left, right, up, down and tilts, His hat comes off and fits nicely in his hand. All in all, I am very happy with how detailed this action figure is. He is a very nice addition to my collection.",
