                "reviewText": "I was purposely looking for a very low output bedside humidifier with a directional delivery spout, to help with my sinuses at night and nosebleeds in morning. On the 'low' setting this one is perfect for that. On low it puts out a fine mist that I can aim towards my head, yet it doesn't wet my head or pillow- it just gives a little (but noticeable) humidity boost to my breathing zone.It is ultrasonic, so those (me) with high water hardness must use distilled water, or will be breathing in micro particles of minerals and chlorine. In my use case, the low output is very helpful, as I don't have to go through gallons of expensive distilled water to get the job done. In 3 nights, I think I've only gone through half a tank or less. That said, if you use the high setting, the output volume increases dramatically, maybe 2 or 3 times low. Still, I don't think it would humidify my entire large bedroom with forced hot air- there is too much airflow there.Operationally- The spout is a little hard to rotate (sticks a bit), but presumably you only have to do it once and you're done. Or use a pencil in the output hole- easy.Small footprint- it fits well next to my clock radio. You turn the device on, and cycle through 5 modes, by just touching the 'on' button in front. Very sleek, and easier to clean than an actual mechanical button. The 5 cycles are low, low with light, high with light, high (no light), then off.A small point- I find the nightlight more annoying than useful. It is a pale blue color that bothers me at night (unlike orange or red), and so I don't plan to use it, but some may like it.",

                "reviewText": "I received this humidifier as a Christmas gift and I love it. The instructions are simple to understand, and using the humidifier is a breeze. I use this humidifier almost every night, and it's mostly quiet as a whistle, except every now and then it makes a draining sound (I can best describe it as a bloop sound). I also love the nightlight being part of the humidifier. It's a very dim, soft blue light, but it still gives enough light to where you can see your surroundings. The water tank holds a great amount of distilled water. If I fill it halfway, it lasts an entire night and halfway through the next morning. If I fill it to the maximum (I recommend just filling it halfway), it lasts even longer. In conclusion, I highly recommend giving this humidifier a try!",

You can also choose whether to have the night light on or off - and it is pleasant/not overbearing when on. I feel I got a great value.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the MistAire Silver Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier for my bedroom. This model is smaller than I expected; however, it works equally well as the last humidifier that held almost 1 gallon of water. I keep my humidifier running all night long and the MistAire tank still has water in the morning. It is very, very quiet and you can elect to either have the night light on or off. It has touch control versus turning a dial. My cat likes to sleep next to the humidifier; so, I need to be careful where I place it so that she does not accidentally touch the control setting when walking/rubbing next to it.One thing to note is that I also purchased the Protec Humidifier Tank Cleaning Fish; it is too large for the opening into the water tank. I was able to find the Protect Humidifier Tank Cleaning Cartridge (shape of small ball) that fits fine. Regardless of brand of humidifier, I recommend using these as it prevents the pink mold from building up. It also helps to use distilled water. Note that the Pure Enrichment\u00ae MistAire\u2122 Silver Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier includes a cleaning brush. Too early to comment on cleaning!Definitely Recommend!",

There are two humidifier settings, and I like the fact that I can also choose to illuminate the nightlight or not. It's small with a clean, modern design and a beautiful color. Five stars!",

Unfortunately the reservoir is almost impossible to clean because the only opening is to put water in despite mold collecting all along the base. We've run distilled water though it only, tried the mildew reducing tabs, etc. and nothing seems to work. It wouldn't be such a big deal if it weren't so difficult to clean.",

But I want to point out one thing is that I really wish that there is another mode, a medium level that's between low and high. Low was sufficient for me, but sometimes I need more humidity level. When I tried high mode, it was strong, it did help my baby nephew with her cold a lot, her nose was stuffy. However, it got my floor soaked. I think it was because I put it on low surface. If anyone wonders about cleaning brush, well I do wish that there are more different than just one cleaning brush like I think the current one is slightly short to reach inside the hole to clean the top plastic part.",

This is an absolutely amazing purchase. I love that you can disconnect the cord, that's a huge selling point. Putting the water in is a little strange but I am completely used to it by now. I have only had to clean it out once so far (but I put already-filtered water into the container). And the fact that you have the option of it being on with no light is amazing, I usually have to tape sticky notes over things I use at night. It does make a loud gurgling noise when water moves down to the base, but otherwise I honestly forget this thing is running all the time, it is SO quiet! Aesthetically pleasing, easy to use and clean, has a warrantee option available, super quiet, no or blue lighting. And most importantly, it works! My apartment is usually so dry and this helps me sleep through the night without my entire mouth and throat drying out.Not sure why it's asking me about warmth - it has no temperature. I put a couple things along with in the photo just for a sense of its size. I would definitely recommend this one.",
