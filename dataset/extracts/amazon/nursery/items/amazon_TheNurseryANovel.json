I do remember the very difficult early days after bringing my first-born home, and remember the exhaustion and hormones raging through me as I tried to make it through some days, but I believe my baby himself l, as well as the support I received from my husband and family, kept me from suffering from depression. I am lucky to be able to say this, and so very thankful.It was hard reading about this poor mother\u2019s mental state and how she felt about and towards her baby. There were even times that I found myself feeling emotional, upset, and angry to read what she did, said, and thought. To not have support from even your husband made her suffer even more, and my heart did ache for her.This is a dark and difficult read, mostly because of the topic, but it was written well.",

                "reviewText": "My son is nearly two years old and let me tell you, The Nursery by Szilvia Molnar took me right back to those early days when he was attached to me more than he wasn't, I didn't know what time it was, and sleep came in minutes, not hours. There were parts of postpartum life that I think I blocked from memory and The Nursery, for better or worse, brings it all back.The Nursery is a hard read. It's a very intimate look at a woman in the throes of postpartum life. Call it PPD, call it PPA, call it what you will. I will be shocked to meet a woman who has had a newborn and doesn't relate to this novel at least in part.There is so much symbolism in this book to be explored. Most glaring is the fact that the mother is simply an unnamed woman, the baby is referred to as Button, but the men in the novel both have names.Overall, I needed a little more from this novel. It's short, which is good because the subject matter is often dark, but I could've used another fifty pages or so.One aspect that really could've used a more real estate for me was the mother's feelings toward her husband and the impact on their relationship that the new baby had. I feel that this is overwhelmingly ignored in literature and can leave new moms feeling disoriented and isolated. There are glimpses of how the couple's relationship had changed but not enough, and often what was glimpsed felt slightly inauthentic. For example, though there were passing references of resentment and a lack of interest in intimacy, in the next breath, the woman would comment on how much she adored her husband.The woman's relationship with Peter gave me some Man Called Ove vibes and I was there for it.The moss stuff was super bizarre and that's all I'll say about that.Overall, there is so much to unpack in this short novel. It's emotional, it's infuriating, it's heartbreaking, and ultimately it's very relatable. That being said, it's relatable for a very specific subset of people and for that reason, this is one I'll recommend selectively.Thank you to Pantheon and NetGalley for the advanced copy.",
