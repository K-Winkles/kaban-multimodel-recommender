                "reviewText": "I bought these for my nursery. They are so cute once they\u2019re up, the screws and little leveler it comes with were extremely useful. Ideal size for a few teddy bears or even books. I gave it 4 stars because we started off with one shelf and as soon as we went to attach it to the wall, it chipped on the side as soon on the picture. Very noticeable depending on where you\u2019re putting the shelf. We were even more careful with the second one and it did the same thing. The green dinosaurs arm is covering it.Overall tho, would buy again!",
