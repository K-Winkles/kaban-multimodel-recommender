The comfort level is exceptional, with plush cushioning that is perfect for those long nights rocking the baby to sleep. The gliding motion is smooth and soothing, both for me and my little one.The build quality is impressive - it's sturdy and well-constructed, giving me confidence that it will last through the baby and toddler years. The armrests are at a comfortable height, and the side pockets are a thoughtful touch for storing essentials like burp cloths, books, or a phone.The ottoman is a great addition, providing additional comfort for my legs, especially during longer feeding sessions. It also glides in sync with the chair, enhancing the overall relaxing experience.The aesthetics of the glider are also noteworthy. It fits beautifully in our nursery decor, and the fabric is easy to clean, which is essential with little ones.Overall, the Storkcraft Premium Hoop Glider and Ottoman offer a perfect blend of comfort, functionality, and style. It's a must-have for any new parent looking for a cozy, reliable rocking chair for their nursery. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I used this chair as part of my plan to surprise my husband that we were expecting so I had to set this up myself at a few weeks pregnant. I'm under 5 feet tall and less than 150lbs, so it did not take me much power to put this together before he got home.I received this rocking chair quickly, The box was heavy-ish but I was able to slide it into the house and take everything out of the box and bring it upstairs without hassle. It took me about 30 minutes to set up because you only really put together the back of the chair and the two arm rests. The one bolt/screw combo for the armrests were a little difficult doing it by myself but I was able to figure it out and that was literally the most difficult part. Everything else connected smoothly. The foot rest was slightly uneven making it knock on our floor when rocked. I will place something under the one corner to even it out. Right now I am using a piece of cardboard that came with the box and it is working just fine.The last annoyance was the snaps for the armrest cushions had a very hard time snapping because the material had no give. It took me a few tries to pull it taught enough that it would stay. Again, there were annoyances and not something that would have stopped me from buying this or make me want to return it. Hopefully, they do not unsnap while rocking because that will be a little more than annoying.It feels very sturdy to me. The wood felt solid and the chair did not make me feel like I was going to fall through. We will have my husband try who is a good 260lbs but honestly, I think he would think I paid more for it than I did.It feels comfortable, I am not sure if the cushions will flatten but sitting in it for a few minutes made me want to fall asleep.All in all I would say buy it!",

The holes were not properly drilled, it was just a tiny little indent that indicated where they should go. Hubby had to really force the screws into the wood for me. Other than that this chair had been really enjoyable and very comfortable for me and the little one. Haven\u2019t experienced any damage or squeaking as some others have reported. It shipped nicely. We are happy with it and would recommend to others as it is a nice chair and priced very fairly.",

I ended up just loosening up all the bolts, lined it all up, sinched em back down, no big deal! However, this is still an issue that should be attended to. Mine also arrived with a broken strut on the bottom of the chair, again not a huge deal and more than likely not the companies fault, but rather the shipping company. The snaps are eh, I had to work to keep them snapped, but some super glue otta keep em down. The back rest cushion is pretty nice, the seat cushion is eh, the arms are alright. The ottoman is quite nice! Overall, this thing is super easy to put together with a little trickery, it has some misalignments, but a solid 6.5/10 for a $160 chair.",
