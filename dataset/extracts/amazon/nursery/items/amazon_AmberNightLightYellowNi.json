                "reviewText": "I ordered the amber set of night lights. I really like them & the dimmer feature is terrific, however there is one design flaw on this nightlight. You cannot turn them on manually, they only work in the dark. If they are placed in a room or spot that is dark, they stay on all the time. If there is other light from sunlight or artificial light of a lamp, wall or ceiling light, these nightlights will not turn on unless you cover the light sensor. I cannot believe they designed these without the option of a including an on/off to bypass the light sensor, so you can turn them on or off at will. Really stupid not to have that option. It would make them 100% functional & much, much more versatile. I had planned to use one as an additional nightlight in my windowless bathroom, but it will stay on all the time & even the light from my other nightlight prevents this one from turning on. :( Great overall design, but without a manual switch, definitely limits usage. Wish they would add a manual on/off switch to the design. If they did, I would buy more & give them as gifts. I'm sure the other illumination choices (daylight, soft white & bright white) are terrific. The amber is soothing & has cozy warm color. No idea what the other color illumination choices are like, but I do very much like the amber.",
