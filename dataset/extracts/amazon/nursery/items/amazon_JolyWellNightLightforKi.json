                "reviewText": "This is hands down my favorite and most used baby item to date. We have use this every single night for bottle feeding since birth. Still works great after 5 months. I originally bought an expensive Hatch and couldn't even get the thing to connect to the wifi (and you can't use the light function without WiFi) so I returned that stupid thing and bought this gem for a fraction of the price. Easy to use, battery lasts forever despite having it on for 2-3 hours each night and I maybe charge every three weeks. Will use as a nightlight for baby when he is bigger.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the JolyWell Night Light for Kids, specifically the Egg Light design, and I must say I am thoroughly impressed with both the product and the outstanding customer service.Upon receiving the package, I eagerly set up the night light for my child, only to find that the first one was faulty and didn't work. Naturally, I was a bit disappointed, but my experience took a turn for the better when I contacted JolyWell's customer service.To my delight, they responded promptly and were incredibly understanding of the situation. They offered a hassle-free replacement without any additional cost, ensuring that my child would not be without their new night light for long. The replacement arrived quickly, and I am happy to report that it works perfectly.The Egg Light design itself is adorable, emitting a soft and comforting glow that's just right for creating a soothing atmosphere in my child's room. The build quality is impressive, and the materials used feel durable, assuring me of its longevity.What truly sets JolyWell apart, though, is their exceptional customer service. In an age where customer service can make or break a brand, JolyWell has demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction that is truly commendable. Their responsiveness and willingness to resolve issues promptly have earned my trust and loyalty.In conclusion, despite a minor hiccup with the initial product, I am thoroughly satisfied with the JolyWell Night Light for Kids, Egg Light. The combination of a delightful and functional product with top-notch customer service makes this purchase a five-star experience. I highly recommend JolyWell to anyone in search of quality products backed by a company that truly values its customers.",

After using it for a couple weeks it will just turn on by itself and to the brightest setting which wakes me, my husband and the baby up.",

I bought it for a change table for nighttime diaper changes and liked it so much I bought another for nighttime nursing/feeding sessions. All three functions work great (regular dimming lamp, colourful light and nightlight function) and it\u2019s small and portable. I love that it\u2019s cordless. Can\u2019t recommend this enough! Might be one of my favourite Amazon purchases.",

La segunda la acabo de comprar hace 2 meses y s\u00faper bien aunque no me encanta que sea de colores aunque a mi hija le encanta y extra\u00f1o que tenga tono blanco. Pero es excelente producto",
