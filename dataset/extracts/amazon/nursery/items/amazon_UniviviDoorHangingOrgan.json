One of the \"shelves\" holds about 20 of my diaper covers (we use washable diapers). It would hold at least as many small size disposables. Another shelf holds all my bibs, another has the diaper inserts, one has burp cloths and changing pads, and one has wipes and toiletry (diaper paste, lotion, digital thermometer, pacifiers). I don't use the upper pockets only because they're too high for me to reach. it's been a lifesaver because I don't need to leave the area to get anything while baby is on the changing table. Once I don't need baby items, I think this is sturdy enough to be used for other items like socks, lingerie, etc (but on the inside of the closet door, lol)",

The pockets keep their shape and look great, and the hooks over the door don't interfere with the functionality of the door like some similar products I've had before. It was also super easy to put together. My only complaint is that it does not hold against the door like advertised. It almost immediately comes unstuck when you place anything in the pockets, and I'm only holding diapers so it's not like it's heavy!",
