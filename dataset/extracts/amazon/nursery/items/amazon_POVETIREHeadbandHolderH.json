The price was great and for the most part all the pieces seem like good quality for the dowel rod and the stitching of the ribbon. My only complaint and reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the connection between the 2nd and 3rd dowel rod. I\u2019m not sure why those two come apart and have a plastic connector, when the top and bottom rods are one solid rod so it\u2019s not like they did it to fit into a shipping box or something. The plastic adaptors that came with it were too thick to fit through the ribbon and stuck out and looked really bad. I tossed them away and tried super glueing (I didn\u2019t have wood glue) the ends together and that temporarily is working. I do think I will end up just going to the craft store and buying dowel rod and making my own solid pieces. Other then that I like the display solution for storage and keeping the bows organized instead of in a balled up mess in her drawer",

The wooden sticks that hold up the straps are sturdy but I guess the straps needed to be glued down to the sticks because they just move all over the place. Also the hooks that come with it are not stationary either so it gets a little annoying trying to hang hats from them when they're also moving around and not steady. I haven't tried putting the ribbon clips on it yet but as of now I do have a good bit of headbands hanging on it and also used the bottom level for my toddler's hats and it's holding up okay.",
