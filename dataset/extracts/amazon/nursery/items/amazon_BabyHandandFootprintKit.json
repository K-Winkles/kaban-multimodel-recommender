This frame comes with a letter holder to imprint the letters in the clay. This is essential!! It keeps the letters even and readable. It was pretty easy to use, a little time consuming to cut all the letters off. You will want to trim the letters close to the plastic border or they won\u2019t fit in the holder.The clay was very moldable and was not dried out at all. You will probably need a second person to help wrangle your baby to get a decent impression (but if you mess up you can just reroll it and try again). The clay didn\u2019t have a super chemically smell and the frame is so cute. I love it and it\u2019s a very thoughtful gift that we will have for our lifetime. I will probably buy another to get paw prints from my dog.",

                "reviewText": "It was definitely difficult to get the print itself because my daughter was less than a month old and not use to being touched and having pressure on her hands or feet, but we got it done.I am thoroughly happy with the end result. I would highly recommend this purchase for any sentimental parent.The clay was easy to manipulate but I don't recommend the roller at all. Just use your hands and put pressure down on it. There is some curvatures from your hand but much less noticeable then the rolling pin marks which become more prominent. Also, I didn't have any cracks and I believe that is because of the pressure I put down on the clay and the amount of time I took kneeding the clay.I also recommend painting the negative space as if you paint the prints themselves you lose the indentations and wrinkles of the hands and feet, as the paint helps even things out. Case in point the negative space doesn't look bad at all, in my opinion, when it comes to different levels of dimension.Hope this helps people! I have the original before I painted the negative space to help with that decision.",
