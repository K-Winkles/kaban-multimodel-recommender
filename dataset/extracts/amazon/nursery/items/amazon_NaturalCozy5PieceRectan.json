Looks great! Would definitely recommend. You will not be disappointed!",

There are a lot of different sizes and I haven't found uses for them all yet. I use the largest one to hold skincare and haircare and it fits perfectly on my vanity. I use the other ones for medication and miscellaneous stuff. I love these for meds because the sides are the perfect height for bottles so they don't fall out, but I can still clearly see the labels especially on bigger supplement bottles. I like that stuff doesn't roll over in these because they're fabric. If I tried to store meds in a plastic bin, they'd fall over and roll around. Also they're a great value for the price. If I had bought these somewhere else like Target, I would've had to buy them individually for $10+ each.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a set of these woven baskets, and while I found them to be cute and incredibly durable, I was a bit surprised by their size.Let\u2019s start with the positives. These baskets are undeniably well-made. The quality of the weaving and the materials used is outstanding, and I have no doubt that they will last for a long time. The durability is a big plus, as they can handle daily wear and tear with ease.In terms of aesthetics, these baskets are absolutely adorable. The woven design gives them a charming, rustic feel that adds a lovely touch to any room. They\u2019re not only functional but also decorative.However, my only gripe is that they are smaller than I had anticipated. When I ordered them, I had a particular use in mind, and I thought they would be a bit larger. So, if you\u2019re planning to store larger items in these baskets, be prepared for a bit of a squeeze.Despite the size issue, I do find these baskets to be a worthwhile purchase due to their durability and cuteness. Just be sure to check the dimensions carefully and set your expectations accordingly. They\u2019re perfect for smaller items or as decorative accents in your living space.",
