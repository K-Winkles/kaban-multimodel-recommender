In my mind, the idea of spending money on tags was silly.. however I\u2019m glad I just went ahead and bought them. They\u2019re very sturdy and durable. And so cute! The size is perfect because it was bulky and sticking out to look tacky in the closet, but it stuck out just enough to had separation in clothes sizes. The closet is lots more organized now. And they don\u2019t slip off the rod.I will for sure buy these for every baby shower gift.",
