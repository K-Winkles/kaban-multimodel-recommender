                "reviewText": "We have a small linen closet that also has a dirty clothes hamper in it. So, I was looking for something to get rid of the odor. Pro or con - depending on your preference - they have a slight scent when you open the package, but you don't smell the scent after that....like when you open the closet door (which I prefer). Pro - they work great at eliminating odor. They may be mini size, but they are mighty! I have found that other scented brands can have an over-powering smell that overwhelms me when I open the door, and doesn't do as good a job at eliminating the odor. Con - there is no adhesive for sticking. Although you could probably use command strips or something like to hang. My work around was to place two in my closet - one on the edge of the top shelf, and one on the edge of the bottom shelf, where they won't get bumped or moved. I think these would work well in larger closets too, you would just need to use more depending on the closet size, and make sure you space them out for maximum coverage. I don't know yet if it will last the full 90 days, I'm hoping to get at least 30 days. So far, I think this is a great find, and it's doing what I need it to do. I would recommend this product.",

However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well they block the odor in the diaper genie. I have it stuck in the top where the slot is for the brand charcoal filters and it has drastically reduced the bad smell that can permeate when it\u2019s opened. I\u2019m pretty sensitive to perfumes and I don\u2019t smell whatever the scent in these is supposed to be. As long as I\u2019m not smelling the poo diapers then that\u2019s all I care about.",

                "reviewText": "When looking for the Arm& Hammer deodorant puck replacements for the Munchkin Step Diaper Pail, these are the first things that come up. The image looks EXACTLY like the Arm& Hammer deodorant pucks that came with the Munchkin Step Diaper Pail. The description states \"Great for diaper bags, diaper pails,... \" Unfortunately, the parenthetic warning \"(not for use as a replacement in the lid of Munchkin Diaper Pails)\" is buried at the end of the same bullet touting that these are appropriate and \"Great\" for diaper pails\u2014with the text split between two lines, and the word \"not\" on a separate line from \"for.\" Nothing mentions that they make a miniature version that looks the same in photos as the one that fits the item that you named in the search bar. The measurements are almost unnoticeable. The numbers \"1.97 x 1.97 x 0.79 inches\" are down the page, next to Product Dimensions\u2014adjacent to the item's Best Sellers Rank of \"#1 in Diaper Pail Deodorizers.\" Again, here's the problem: THEY'RE THE WRONG SIZE! THEY'RE TINY! THEY DON'T FIT THE MUNCHKIN STEP DIAPER PAIL! And the warning is hidden in the listing. If you're the type of consumer that has the time and focus to carefully comb through an Amazon page looking for a product's carefully hidden booby-traps, then you might catch this. But if you're the type of consumer that's likely to shop for diaper pail related products\u2014that is, a frazzled parent raising an infant during a pandemic, short on sleep and with a reduced attention span\u2014then there's a good chance that you might miss this buried lead. C'MON AMAZON! This has been called to your attention before, by approximately 10% of the reviews. Your well-disguised, carefully-hidden language, written by lawyers for the purpose of maintaining deniability, isn't working for a significant number of customers. Fix this.",
