The canvas chart is a beautiful addition to the room decor, and the design is both colorful and cute, making it perfect for a child's room. the chart is easy to hang and measures up to 79 inches, so it will last for many years as my child continues to grow. I appreciate that the chart is removable and can be easily rolled up for storage or moved to a different location. The quality of the canvas material is high, and it feels durable and long-lasting. The measurement markings are clear and easy to read, and the chart is accurate. Overall, I highly recommend the MIBOTE Baby Growth Chart Handing Ruler for anyone looking for a cute and functional way to track their child's growth. It's a great value for the price, and I give it 5 stars for its quality, design, and functionality.",

They were!I have young children (I am assuming people buy this are doing do also to document their childrens growth) & I'm a little nervous about how long the top rope will hold up if they run touch or swing it (at some point I'm sure it will happen). So far hanging nicely in its forever home.I gave it a 3/5 for durability because as I was transfering their previous measurements from their sticker measuring chart. I made 2 mistakes. Since it \"canvas\" (which is coated in something) I attempted erasing/cleaning my mistake. The actual black wiped off in both spots. I attempted to make the black darker with permanent marker.Love that it goes to 6ft 5in our entire family's heights can be documented!!Having said all the above, I would still recommend this chart. Good quality for the price. I also love that we can take it with us very easily if we ever move!*Added pictures to illustrate above comments.",
