She is at the point where she is on the move, so I wanted something affordable as well as compact to use on my auntie days.This playpen definitely fit the criteria! It\u2019s large and easy to assemble. It holds all of her toys and has plenty of space to toss in a small furry playmate or two. (Peppers is a GREAT babysitter!) I both like and dislike the tube assembly, and the only reason I dislike is that it\u2019s time consuming for me, but that is not a product flaw so I won\u2019t take away from how awesome this has been. I have set it up and taken it apart several times now and none of the pieces are showing signs of breakage or wear.The only thing I wish this had, and again not a flow of the product I bought because it is listed how it arrived and has met my needs, is a bag to put the pieces in. I kept the box, which is simple enough, but if you don\u2019t when disassembled, it is a lot of pieces.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I have been pleased with this product despite initial misgivings. Since the standard seems to be \"give a 5 if acceptable\", we have our score. Pros: easy to assemble, durable in the right way. Cons: internal dimensions are not accurate. Indifferent: thin flooring.(Assembly, Pro) The play area assembled rather easily due to its rod-and-joint design. About 30 identical metal tubes are inserted into various plastic joints to build the frame, and the frame holds up the skin of the play area. Some have suction cups, some are corners, and they all slide together with a tight friction fit. These tubes and joints are on the outside of the skin, making it highly unlikely your child will ever access them from within the playpen.(Durability, Pro) I see a lot of reviews mentioning sturdiness as a downside, and I can see where they are coming from. A child can shake the walls of the pen, and it will flex slightly. However, I believe this is a design choice. The flexion is from the plastic joint pieces sliding around the tubes. It is not the joint or tube itself bending. Perceived looseness comes from protecting the frame from stress such that the plastic does not bend. All components are readily replaceable or repairable if something were to happen to them, allowing for a fix, not a total repurchase.(Thin Floor, Indifferent) The floor is quite thin. You will want to line the floor of the playmat with something. I used 2'x2' interlocking gym flooring.(Dimensions, Con) The dimensions listed are not the internal size. I purchased the 70\"x50\" play area and 72\"x48\" of gym flooring material. I knew I would have to cut the length and maybe trim material from the edges to get a secure fit. Once installed, I needed to cut 2 inches from the width of the tiles and about four from the length. This is significantly more than expected. If you are using a quilt or fabric mat, the soft materials may help you ignore this.",

It is light enough for me to muscle it around ... I tip it up on it's side and can move it ... this is a tinker-toy type of construction so it took me about 30 min to set up and once together is VERY solid. The 3 year old wants to play in there too so the zipper doorway is kind of a neat feature. I bought this to keep a 1 year old contained ... he is crazy active and I just cannot keep him out of mischief. This way he gets to sit behind me while I work at my desk and he is happy. I have a pack-n-play already but this is plenty of space for toys, he moved around, he can eat cookies in there ... so much more room ... maybe 4x the size of pac n play ... maybe a bit bigger. Really happy with this. I am leaving it up until he learns to mind vocal commands. Probably be awhile. LOLOL",

This is great because then the play yard is a fun place, not a place of confinement. Also, love the mesh - baby can see out and you can see them. Two suggestions: since this yard is pretty easy to assemble/disassemble, I would really have appreciated a duffle bag to tote this on the road. Second, there is pad made for this play yard. It should be offered as an accessory. I stumbled upon it later. Otherwise - awesome product!",

For as taut as the fabric is between the pipes is, I didn't hear any ripping or tearing like the stitching was in distress. One thing that was difficult for me which I probably could have avoided as I was putting the corner pipes in was after they were in I had a hard time pulling the tight fabric over the bottom corner plastic pieces. And don't be a dummy like me and put the corner bottom piece in wrong so that the suction cup isn't on the bottom \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. But ima just leave it cuz it's not a big deal to me and trying to pull these pipes out are harder than pushing them in for me. \ud83d\ude2c enjoyyyy, I think we're about to have a little more free time on our hands mom and dads. \ud83d\ude42",

This is the perfect size and a safe place for him! It was also super easy to put together! I'm 5 months pregnant and I got it together in about 20 minutes!!",

                "reviewText": "The mat is very thin and barely provides padding. It is very light and does not stay in place, sliding around and folding up.The zipper has broken already, we\u2019ve only had it for a couple weeks.Those are the reasons it\u2019s a three star. It does work, though, and the walls are pretty sturdy. The mesh on the sides is easy for babies to see through, and like a pack n play.",
