                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars For the price, this is pretty good! Comes with Allen wrench required to assemble",
                "reviewText": "First off, this was very easy to assemble. It took me only 5-10 minutes by myself. Secondly, it feels pretty sturdy. The feet on the bottom seem level with one another so there\u2019s no wobble. I love when furniture like this comes an Allen wrench or whatever tools you need. It had all the required screws and a bag with a couple extras and the required Allen wrench. All the screws with different heads were easy to tell apart and all the pieces were labeled. The instructions were easy to follow.Aesthetically speaking, I think it looks nice for the most part. I ordered the white and beige, and the white paint job on the top isn\u2019t the highest quality ever but it\u2019s really not that noticeable. You have to be looking at it from a certain angle in certain lighting to notice that it\u2019s not the highest quality paint job. It kind of looks like they painted it with Kilz and called it a day. It could have used one more coat. But the surface is smooth and doesn\u2019t seem scratched. I\u2019ll also be putting things on top of this table, so it really won\u2019t be noticeable.Getting to some smaller details, I attached a picture of the basket and it is able to hang down with about a 1 inch gap between the bottom of it and the legs. I think this looks nicer rather than having the basket wrinkle up and be cramped in the space provided.The only thing I see being an issue with this design, however is that if you put anything heavy in the basket, over time, I think the support rods for the basket will gradually wear at the fabric and possibly cause a hole. I only plan on keeping a lap blanket or something light in the basket anyway. The basket also has a structured base. I\u2019d say the bottom of the basket feels more sturdy than cardboard, however, not quite as hard as real wood. Maybe it\u2019s a thin MDF board?Overall, for 40$, this is a pretty good end table and much more sturdy than a lot more expensive pieces I\u2019ve bought online before.Also, if you order this and it looks like Piece B won\u2019t line up with Pieces C and D- it will. Just look it like a clock and screw in at 12:00 and 6:00, then screw in at 9:00 and 3:00.",

All pieces were labelled and instructions were simple.The only two downsides I noticed are- When you attach the metal ring to the table top, the pre-drilled holes don\u2019t line up perfectly with the holes in the metal ring, so the screws want to go in crooked. You may have to fiddle to get a good fit.- I also noticed this table blemishes very easily. If you tighten the screws into the table top even a little too snug, tiny little cracks appear in the wood/paint next to the hole. Table came with small marks in the paint on the edge of the table top.",
