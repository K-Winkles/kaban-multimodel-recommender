Definitely recommend these if you're trying to get more bang for your buck!",

They look nice and the dividers will help when baby gifts arrive, to put them in the right size slot so baby doesn't grow past clothing that has been gifted. (I did not mark sturdiness or durability because they have not been used yet, but the previous reviews were good for that.)",

I needed a way to keep them organized by size and found this hanger set with the size markers. It\u2019s perfect! The hangers are smaller to fit the baby size clothes well. The markers are easy to slide onto the closet bar and are made of a durable plastic. This predict has helped me keep track of what I have is each size.",
