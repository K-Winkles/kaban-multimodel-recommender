I wanted something that was going to be warm in cooler temps but breathable and cool for hot Arizona summers. This blanket is just that! The pattern of the fabric makes it feel fuller/fluffier but it\u2019s thin enough is cool and breathable. I bought it in the color Oatmeal and it\u2019s a really pretty light beige. Really happy with this purchase and will be reordering in the future.",

I was worried the waffle pattern would \"pick\" easily and so far, we have not had that experience. I can see myself buying more of these for baby gifts in the future!",
