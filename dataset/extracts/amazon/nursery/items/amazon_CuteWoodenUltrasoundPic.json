                "reviewText": "This is a well-made, easy to assemble wooden frame that is perfect for displaying sonogram or picture of baby using adhesive clips on one side, and baby's footprints and birth details on the other side. It comes with clear instructions on set up, and is nicely boxed if you are gifting. One important thing to note is that no pen is included and it recommends NOT using permanent markers, oil-based pens, or pens containing solvents as they might harm, discolor, or smear the wood surface. It is recommended to test whatever you do decide to use in a small area. Personally, I plan to use vinyl and my Cricut- I have used both removeable, permanent, and heat transfer vinyl on similar wood products before and they have all worked beautifully.Also love the ink pad and how it is mess free for baby!!! Of course, if you print directly on the wood, you only get one shot at it, but they actually give you an extra set of adhesive clothespin-style clips, so you could also try doing footprints on a small piece of white cardstock and just clip it to the frame! Then you can have multiple attempts and choose the best print.",
