                "reviewText": "I had been given a diaper genie from a friend. Within 1 week of bringing home baby, my husband insisted the diaper genie was broken and asked me to get something different. The issue with the genie were numerous but the main was the genie was wobbly when trying to pull the bags out, and the bags often tore when replacing.This has solved both problems! Because it\u2019s metal and heavier than the plastic genie, it is sturdier. Additionally, because you can use regular trash bags, we haven\u2019t had any issues with the bags tearing. This is one of my favorite aspects bc it\u2019s 1 less thing to purchase. The capacity also appears to be slightly more. Overall the capacity of diapers on both is somewhat disappointing, as we have to empty it 2-3x a week, and only do about half the diaper changes in the nursery. Although I get the impression we may be going through more diapers on a daily basis than average.I would mention that we have nearly overstuffed it a few times, and I\u2019ve been nervous about ripping the bag. However, if it\u2019s over stuffed, I\u2019ll just tie the bag, and the reach down between can and bag and move some of the diapers up. (The bags we use are always larger than the can since we use the same ones I buy for our kitchen trash.)I have also been very impressed with the smell. We didn\u2019t have the diaper genie long enough for me to comment on smell but I noticed the other day how well this works to keep the smell in, when I opened it to put in a dirty diaper and was overwhelmed by the stink inside! When properly closed you don\u2019t smell anything! However, you will be subject to that stink when changing out the bags.Lastly, I love that it came in colors. The safe green looks adorable in the woodland themed nursery. Being able to get a color was basically just a bonus that put this diaper bin over the top. Would buy again and recommend to friends.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this Ubbi pail for cat litter waste and here is the results.Pros :The pail is thin and compact and holds a lot of waste. Pretty color and looks nice. Uses regular bags and easy to operate. Lid opening is small which is better to not release a huge amount of stink. It\u2019s almost hard to break the only thing you have to worry about is dings and rust. Being metal it doesn\u2019t absorb stink like plastic can.Cons: You will get a small bit of stink when lid is open while that is common, it says to only use a rag to clean it and after you can still smell stink. So rather hard to clean to get smell off of it. If I\u2019m just using a rag how is that going to clean it ?It can rust. If any contents you put inside are damp it will rust, you need damp rid or silica gel packs inside to absorb any moisture! The opening is small, while it\u2019s great stink wise , it could be a litter bigger to accommodate adult diapers or other uses as for pets. I had to get a skimmer for a pet scoop something small enough to fit. The slide door under can get dirty & hard to clean.Overall it\u2019s good. Definitely not perfect and far from it . It does require maintenance so it\u2019s not maintenance free.I chose this one before the pet version because the pet version while it has a bigger opening it Doesn\u2019t have the slide opening like this one.I use a magnetic hook with a opening teabag ball filled with silica packets to absorb moisture. I also hang a car air freshener inside .But overall I give it a 4. It could last years if you care for it weekly.",

Per cui non spendere soldi con bidoni per gatti, ma prendete questo bidone per pannolini. Risparmiate denaro perch\u00e9 i sacchetti mettere a random quelli che volete voi.. non ci sono appositi sacchetti da comprare ogni tot. Per cui ottimo !! E trattiene gli odori",
