This machine has great sound options and different colors, but I only ever use one sound and one light. I like that the buttons are easy and I can turn it off and on in the dark with a baby in my arms. Having the app control is nice so that I can check on it while I'm out of the room, but I hardly use it. My favorite part about the machine is it\u2019s portability. If the power goes out in the middle of the night, I know it will keep going. I can easily take it to grandparents house for a nap and not worry about chargers or finding a plug in. I even use it in the car for long trips.",

Instead of playing that I got this and it worked just as well but now I have a multitude of sounds options, soothing light options, and even a timer. It\u2019s really great! Aesthetically, it looks great in the room too! We\u2019re very happy with our purchase!",

I was hoping to use this as a way to tell my toddler he can get out of bed with a green light, but if he is still sleeping the stopping of the noise wakes him. Also, uses WiFi, so it always says that it\u2019s disconnected even after I have reconnected WiFi a handful of times. Still works without WiFi, just not as useful as I was hoping.",

                "reviewText": "I initially loved this product, especially the extensive collection of songs that kept my baby entertained right from day one. The combination of vibrant lighting and engaging tunes created a delightful atmosphere that my little one thoroughly enjoyed.However, my enthusiasm took a sharp turn when, unexpectedly, the music suddenly ceased playing. The LED lights still function, providing a visually stimulating environment, but the primary feature \u2013 the music \u2013 has unfortunately stopped working altogether. Despite my efforts to troubleshoot the issue using online resources and the product's app, I've hit a dead end.Adding to the frustration is the inability to open the product for a closer look inside. The lack of transparency in terms of design accessibility makes it challenging to identify the root cause of the malfunction. Even with a full charge, the product remains silent, leaving my baby without the soothing melodies that were once a cherished part of our routine.Additionally, the product's app, which I had hoped would assist in troubleshooting, proved to be unhelpful in resolving the issue. This lack of support adds to the disappointment, leaving me with a non-functional product and no clear path to a resolution.In conclusion, while the product brought joy initially, its sudden malfunction and the lack of effective troubleshooting options have left me feeling disheartened. It's disconcerting to invest in a product that seemingly has a limited lifespan, especially when its core functionality becomes compromised.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to buy this machine as I needed a lamp and a white noise machine. And I'm so glad i found it. The 2 white noise machines that I have always turns off its own and it's not easy to move and stretch to turn it back on while carrying/feeding a light sleeper baby. It has many sound options though I frequently use the lullaby option and turn on the white orangey light. I love how I can control the intensity of the light as well, to the dimmest when my 7mo is asleep. And I would lower down the volume before turning it off eventually too. Sometimes when my son is awake, I would play the good morning sound and on the colourful lights just for fun. There's also a timer option for when I want the machine to switch off but I've not use it yet. I wish I have gotten this machine sooner. The only thing that I wish for is for my husband to be able to pair the machine to his phone without the app logging me out automatically. It seems that only 1 person can pair it to their phone. But it's okay, when my phone is out of reach, I can physically press the on button and it will auto on to the previous setting. If you're thinking of a smart white noise machine that doubles up as a lamp, this is it!",
