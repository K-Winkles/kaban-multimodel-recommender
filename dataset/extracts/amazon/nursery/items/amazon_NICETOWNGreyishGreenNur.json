Not only are they thick and sturdy, but they also boast a silky-smooth texture that is visually appealing. From the moment I unpacked them, they were wrinkle-free, and the installation and adjustment process was a breeze. The blackout capability is absolutely perfect, ensuring a pitch-black room. The remarkable quality of this product at such a low price is truly unbelievable. I highly recommend these curtains and am sincerely grateful for such an excellent purchase. Thank you!",

                "reviewText": "These are suprisingly beautiful curtains. They have made my life so much better and they make me happy! I ended up ordering multiple colors and ended up with the natural which is neutral and changes in the light. I have a light blue grey rug and bed set (from Pottery Barn) and they seem to take on a slight grey tone in that context. Also note these curtains are room darkening, not marked blackout. They are absolutely enough to darken my room and create a restful environement beyond the \"blackout blinds\" I had which were not as good as these curtains. It really helps in the morning, if you wake up too early and want to go back to sleep! Added bonus is that my sleep tracker is showing more quality sleep and going into longer deeper sleep sessions. I do owe it to these curtains! Wish I had bought them years ago! I wasn't sure about the grommets but turns out they look good and because they are large it makes them super easy to pull shut. I bought 2 pairs, so I would have a lot of gathering. To me it looks nicer than just having one pair and you don't notice that is isn't one curtain. I was worried about the \"sheen\" but perhaps it's because I ordered the natural, but they don't look shiny at all. These curtains are heavy, so added benefit is blocking drafts (winter here now and hope it works the same in summer). I also noted some noise filtering (I live in the city, so all of this is good!) My only criticism is the wrinkles. this is not horrible or a reason not to order these otherwise terrific curtains, just be aware if you are a perfectionist, you will need to work to get those wrinkles out...they don't \"fall out.\" Granted I did not put iron or ironing board to them. They look like cotton, but indeed are polyester. I used an upright steamer which isn't as effective to get out every wrinkle.",

I feel they would look better if some weight were added to the bottom, such as magnets. IMO these look better with a larger diameter rod. They're still looking good after almost a year.",

I ended up buying another set for my front doors which has back draft problem and we can't change out the doors yet so i decided to put a pair of these on to block and it works well enough. i really do like these. this set i bought to replace my husband's office curtains which are see through but with all the video conferences he really needed to get black out ones. just bought another set for my rental when the tenants moved out and ruined everything. i think i'll buying more for other rooms in the near future as i need them. glad they come in several different sizes.",

These phone cameras are too good at their jobs \ud83d\ude02 I had to do a screen shot of a video to get an accurate representation because even videos once you start recording adjust the light.
