It fits great, provides excellent coverage and is surprisingly supportive. The fabric is also very soft and comfortable against my skin; I hope it stays that way after I wash it. I am not a high impact exerciser and I\u2019m not sure it would be great for running, thought it passed the \u2018jumping test; with flying colors. It will be perfect for my Pilates and yoga classes, and for bricks walks with the dog.",

                "reviewText": "For those with larger breasts, this bra is quite comfortable for hanging out at home, going to the store, etc. I would not consider this a sports bra as the girls bounce with light activity. Perhaps for yoga, stationary biking, and weight lifting it would do just fine. But speed walking and anything higher this bra is not supportive. For that I took off a star. Also, the size chart is off in my opinion. On the chart I should purchase a 2XL. Since I like a tighter fit, I ordered an XL. This one is very loose, but I liked the full coverage for the breasts so I kept it for lazy home days. On occasion, I do need to move the girls back up because the band is pretty loose.Because I liked the coverage, I purchased another one, but this time a Large. This one fits much better for support without the girls falling out the bottom. So if you are looking for something closer to a sports bra fit, I would consider sizing down a couple sizes.",

I do spin classes and this is my go-to! I don\u2019t think this bra would provide the support I need for something like running without potentially sizing down. But for machines/spin it works well. It\u2019s also pretty soft/not itchy and washes well!",

I usually wear a 38I and purchased a 3X. No spillage or riding up in the back. Soft and supportive. The cost seems like a lot for a regular sports bra, but I wouldn't really consider it to be just that. Totally worth the buy.",

So there is a second color coded chart that is more accurate. It is a tight fit for my floppy mom boobs. You can definitely feel the compression but I needed a tight fit around the waist so the ladies didn't pop out below. Overall I am happy with it. I may try a size above for lounging but the medium for 34DD is great for exercising in. The shoulder starps could be longer tho. It gets my shoulders after a while.",

It's comfortable, washes well and moves with me. I'm about the buy another one and hope to buy another color after that. I highly recommend this product.",
