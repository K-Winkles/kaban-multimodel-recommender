I already bought a second one and they arrived just in time for my workout. I will say, it runs small. I\u2019m usually a small or xtra small but I was looking for something that fit comfortably and not super tight so I mega sized up. I ordered a large and found the fit of my dreams. It sits right at my belly button and my sleeves don\u2019t exposed my pits. The fabric is stretchy and thick enough not to show your sports bra color but thin enough that it keeps you warm in winter and cool in summer.",
