The previous material in the earlier years was a little thinner or has worn down due to normal wash and wear but I still loved the pockets and the high waisted fit and durable material. The material in the recent purchases is a lot more thicker and better quality and the fit is still the best. Will keep buying these leggings because the fit, value and quality is perfect.Sizing:When I first bought these I went by the guide and bought and XL but it was too loose. I recommend buying your regular size. I\u2019m 5 ft 5 in and about 205 lb and the L fits me best.",

                "reviewText": "I had no idea they made these type of pants with pockets! It's my BIGGEST gripe with these type of pants, that & being able too see through them...of which these aren't! At first I was thinking there's no way my big Ole phone is fitting in the pockets (I have a Samsung Note 10) and when I see the pocket in the backside waist band I laughed & said ya right! But to my absolute amazement... It FIT! Lol! I couldn't believe it. The phone also fits comfortably in the side pockets, which is where I'd carry my phone anyway, but the back inside waist pocket is my favorite thing about these. You can use it for an ID, Money, even a small carry conceal firearm, which was actually my first thought. You'd just have to practice your draw like anything else! I haven't tried yet, I'm actually going to look for full length pants for that! I've worn these to work where my phone has to be out of site and the side pockets are excellent for that. Also great to wear while doing laundry bc they're not so thick that you're dying to change out of them, but thick enough that you're not afraid to bend over for fear people can see your bottom through the pants (we've all been exposed to THAT look & it's not good...not sure why people don't check for this before leaving the house). They are a great mix of comfort, coolness, and covering with the BEST bonus of all.... POCKETS that Function well! I love these and will absolutely be trying a regular length pair and Def buying a another pair of these. If you rarely order clothes online because of fit, or hate the risk of it not looking like the photos, I feel you and can say this is the first pair of pants I'm not familiar W the brand that I've ordered online. I am extremely happy with them and the fit. I'm normally a size 4 (I normally wear American Eagle jeans) in some brands & a 6 in others and across the board medium in almost everything else and these fit great! I always get regular length and these fell right where they should for capris comfortably.Just DO IT! Lol, you won't regret it.",
