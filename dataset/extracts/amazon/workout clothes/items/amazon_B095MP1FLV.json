                "reviewText": "I wear this set for Pilates. I have tried alo, Ivl, lululemon, Zella, spanx, beach riot, nike, athleta, gap, an alala leggings (probably others) and for the price this set is incredible! The leggings have the perfect amount of compression and the sports bra is both easy to get on but very supportive. The best thing is that these leggings stay up!!! Nothing is worse in my opinion than when leggings get loose and stretch out. These leggings have a slight ribbed fabric which is very flattering on the body. Also, I\u2019ve washed them about a dozen times and they wash and dry perfectly. I couldn\u2019t imagine having the hassle of line drying workout clothes. Lastly, the price can not be beat!",
