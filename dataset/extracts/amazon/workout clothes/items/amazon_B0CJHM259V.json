The material is super thick and has a great amount of compression, with just enough stretch so they are comfortable. They dont budge! I usually am constantly pulling up and readjusting leggings, but these are great quality theres no need for that (: also i'm usually hesitant buying any other color than black because it shows all your bumps and lumps, but these are so thick that they conceal and smooth out all of that",
