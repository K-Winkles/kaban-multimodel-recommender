                "reviewText": "Both medium and small fit me. 5\u20192\u201d 134 lbs. thicker waist and not athletic at the moment. I prefer the small as they have a little more \u201cstay in place\u201d power. The medium tends to slip down a bit over time but still great for lounging. I feel better going out with the small. These both ran long on me, but I just cuff them up by rolling two hemlines. I have a little longer torso and shorter legs. They do not appear to be sheer or see-through, but underwear would be noticeable because of how lightweight the fabric is. Crazy comfortable but actually much more flattering than other brands I\u2019ve tried that had thicker material. Neither size of these bunch or crease in the crotch on me, which is one of the biggest pluses for fit. Very high waisted fit, but the material is so forgiving (yet flattering) that both are comfortable. I usually hate a high waist fit, but my niece insisted I try these and I\u2019m so glad I did! Sticking with black for now because these may not be as flattering in lighter or brighter colors if you have any lumps or bumps due to lightweight fabric.",

Material is lighter than the $100.00 tights available at Athleta, LuLu etc. But if you want to use in gym, running on treadmill, yoga these will be just fine. I especially like the design of pockets. Very sleek; not sticking out like some other types I have. The pockets are higher up on body. I feel this is a nice design. Only drawback is they get shipped with Lasership who I absolutely despise. Always issues with LASERSHIP.",

The length is perfect for someone who\u2019s short like me (5\u20192). The only critique I have is they\u2019re not as tight on my abdomen as I would like and when I have my phone in they fall down slightly. Other than that I will definitely be purchasing more.",

We are completely different body types, but I decided to give them a try.They fit great and were perfectly true to size. The material feels amazing and seems like it smoothes out any bumps. I also am obsessed with the deep pockets - I can store my phone or other random items when I need to be hand free for a moment.All in all, great price, great quality - try them out!",

                "reviewText": "Guess what's been giving my wardrobe life lately? These leggings \u2013 the ultimate Lululemon dupes that won't have you checking your bank balance every time you break a sweat. Let me spill the tea on why I'm absolutely vibing with these bad boys.First off, let's talk about that cozy factor. These leggings are basically a hug for your legs. Super soft, like you're wrapping yourself in a cloud. Whether I'm working out or just Netflix and chilling, they're my go-to for that next-level comfort.But the real MVP move? The fit. These leggings know how to do a waist right. No weird squeezing or awkward looseness \u2013 just a perfect, snug fit that makes me feel like I've got it all together (even when I really don't).And can we talk about durability? I've put these leggings through the wringer, and they're holding up like champs. They bounce back after every wash, keeping their shape and stretchiness intact. No saggy bums or baggy knees here!Style-wise, these leggings are like the chameleons of my closet. Gym? Check. Grocery run? Check. Coffee with friends? Double-check. The sleek design and colors mean they're always ready to slay, no matter where I'm headed.So, in a nutshell, these Lululemon dupe leggings are the real deal. If you're after leggings that feel like a dream, fit like they were made for you, and won't drain your wallet, look no further. They're the unsung heroes of my wardrobe, and I'm totally here for it. \ud83d\udcaf",

I have more athletic thighs that rub together like most women, but I\u2019ve never had leggings that wore in the inner thighs so quickly.Also, the phone pocket is really high, so it is hard to get to.I will say the color is great!

Love the pockets. Oh, and no cameltoe which I get from almost all other leggings including lulu. Survived numerous washes so far, no pilling or decrease in quality. I have a pair of Lulus that I never wear, such a massive waste of money. These are way better. I'll probably end up with every single color before long. Seems perfectly true to size and don't see any differences in sizing amongst my 4 pairs. If you're on the fence, just do it.",

They run true to size. I will definitely be purchasing these going forward over Lululemon.",
