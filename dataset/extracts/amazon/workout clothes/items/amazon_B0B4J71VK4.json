Ill be honestly, When I received my legging I was surprised by the material and I felt I got ripped off BUT I tried them on anyways. I couldn't believe how beautiful they fit, The material hugs your curves. The compress on the tummy is perfect. They don't ris at the ancient whe I'm active, best of all they are NOT see through. These have to be my favorite legging I own. I have since ordered another pair and ordered the body suit this company has. Same thing with their body suit. gorgeous. You will love these leggings. I ordered a med in these leggings, I'm 5'6 165lbs",

I loved they way they fit, super comfortable and not see-through at all which is also a huge plus!Great for working out, everyday wear or even under a dress in the Winter or Fall seasons.",

                "reviewText": "So, I think we all came to purchase these leggings with the same thing in mind. Cute workout leggings that flatter accentuate the booty.Unfortunately these are just not a quality option in my opinion. I bought my normal size and I feel like they fit well, they just didn\u2019t look good. The \u201clines\u201d on the back don\u2019t look the same as in the photos. It\u2019s actually two big circles that go over your butt cheeks and then two lines underneath your butt cheeks of the same material. It\u2019s like a big sign that screams \u201chey! My butt is out! Look at this butt!!!\u201d. To make matters worse, the circles around the butt are also sheer when you bend over lmao so it\u2019s just a lot going on. Personally someone who already has a nice sized behind, it\u2019s too much for me to be comfortable wearing this in any public space.Also, the scrunch in the back just kinda sat on top of my butt if that makes sense lol. The leggings also didn\u2019t provide any lift or shaping so it was very unflattering overall. I was super excited for these so I\u2019m pretty disappointed but I will likely be returning and looking elsewhere for a similar but better pair.**ignore the mess by my door. I came home and immediately tried these on lmao",

Absolutely LOVE!!! My only complaint is that the it doesn\u2019t stay up very well, it tends to roll down if you have to bend. Maybe not great for working out but great if you want to lounge around or run errands.",
