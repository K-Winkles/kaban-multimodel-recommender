But, I knew that when I bought them, didn't see a regular rise option.That is my only dislike.I love these pants, I will definitely be buying more. I use them for work (retail management but I do a lot of physical work there that requires squatting, bending, etc) and they are the absolute best. Comfortable and stretchy... but also look like a regular pair of black pants at a quick glance, and that's what I needed.They've been wash a dozen times. No fading, no distortion of the fabric. No sagging. Seams and stitching still great. Side pockets are deep and they stretch to fit what you need. I also work where there is a lot of grimey fluids that may splash on them.... they never retain any grease like stains.This is a solid buy. I'm 5'5\" (just a sneeze under actually) and 135-140 pounds fluctuating and I bought a size Medium, they fit great. I could probably gain another 5-10 or lose another 5-10 and still fit comfy in that size. Length wise, they fit perfectly and I don't walk on them because they're too long. (an issue I have with a lot of pants lol)",

They are buttery soft, fit perfectly, and somehow make my butt look better than it is. Can't complain about a single thing (other than the lack of color selection in this particular style - but that's probably a good thing. I don't need to be cashing out my 401(k) buying them out).

I'm going to try and stretch them out. However, they only pocket is the small inner pocket that's only big enough to hold a couple coins. I wanted pants for my job that requires me to carry a lot in my pockets, but it looks like I will not be able to use these at work. The pants in a lot of the reviews had big pockets, so I don't understand why my pants arrived without them. The seller should consider adding more pictures and distributing the same pants design to customers to avoid the pocket confusion. Overall, nice pants. Comfy.",

Pockets are great; holds my iPhone 8+ and perfect length maybe just a tad long but I\u2019m only 5\u20192\u201d. They look dressier than regular tights or sweats. Would do it again. Good material.",

                "reviewText": "Was looking for a replacement for my old exercise trousers and hoped these would fit the bill. Was very surprised not only at the quality and fit but also the speed with which I received them. Ordered on Sunday evening and arrived in time for my evening walk after work. They are stretchy but not too constricting and although a little long are fine with chunky trainers. As it is getting warmer they will also be cooler than what I was wearing before, they are also more opaque so no see through. The waistband is wide so more a high rise style and has a tiny pocket, too small for my phone, but I'm sure could be useful for keys or change. I'm a 16-18 and the XXL was perfect.",
