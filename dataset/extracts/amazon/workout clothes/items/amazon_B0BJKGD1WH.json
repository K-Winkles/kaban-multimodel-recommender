Love them so much I got an additional pair and will likely get more! I do get the pilling where my thighs rub but no rips or tears and have been wearing them a month and a half now.

I'm not a huge fan of the scratchy nylon material so these are great in that aspect. Super soft. They are very thin. Almost feels like you aren't wearing them.I wish they provided a little more support, but hey are high waisted so there's that. But with the material being so thin, they don't give as much support as I like. But that's a preference for me. I still like them and will keep them. Not see through at all which is a huge accomplishment.All in all, I like them.",

                "reviewText": "Not sure what to think of these. First off, they're definitely not true to size. I ordered a 2XL. When hold them up, they look like a medium. When I put them on they fit a little bigger than an XL but not much. They do have pockets, which is a plus and they are buttery soft. I'm not quite sure if they're see through or not. I wore them to go get a pedicure but I'm not sure I'd wear these to the gym. Definitely comfy for around the house. For reference, I'm 5'6\" tall and wear a size 16 in jeans and I'm bottom heavy. Big bottom and big thighs.",
