I ordered an XL first, and had to re-order a XXL. I'm a size XL in every other top, however these run smaller than name brand. 2 shirts and 2 gym workouts in and so far the best part is the light weight and moisture wicking properties. The fit still is off; between shoulders, chest and mid-section, even with the upsizing. Will keep them and use them based on price, but will keep looking for other shirts to replace my current daily gym shirt wardrobe.",

It's printed on. Genius.That being said, the reason I said 'almost' new above, that printed tag in the collar - is started to wear off.Who...f'n....cares. That's literally the only thing on these to show any wear.Even the reflective strips on the back and arms are completely intact, not even a wrinkle! That surprised me, usually anything reflective looks like garbage after just a few wash&dry cycles.I kinda wish I'd ordered a multi-color 3 pack other than just black though, just because these are literally all I wear to the gym and I'm worried people think I wear the same shirt every day haha. But I like black.Logo on the chest looks kinda lame, but it's small, and I guess they've gotta rep their brand somewhere.Overall very comfortable, light, breathable, fits well - worth the buy.",
