I was shocked by how heavy the three were when I picked up the package, demonstrating the level of quality before I opened them. They fit well. Booty scrunch is less pronounced than the listing suggests, which is fine though I do prefer a scrunch that really shows those cheeks, lol. You could likely size down with these, especially if you're in between sizes.",

The material has a nice thickness to it, giving the leggings some compression, but not too, too much (it hugs curves in the right places).Wore these to the gym the next day after ordering and I was thrilled that nothing was showing through the fabric even with stretching and bending!The only thing that kinda sucks is that part of the legging, near the ankle, already tore a little because I pulled them a little too tight I guess. The tear isn\u2019t that noticeable, but it was unfortunate.Overall, definitely worth the price. I\u2019m considering ordering other colors!",

I wore them with my uggs and you could see my leg at times above the top of the boot. Um no thank you. But they'll be better when spring starts and I can wear them like low capris. And they look alright with sneakers, but it's been cold to have my ankles and lower calf out",

I got a medium and while it\u2019s a tiny bit tight I\u2019m ok with it just because it doesn\u2019t have flaps around the crotch area and it holds in the tummy nicely also makes the butt look so good. Also no camel toe. I like these for everyday wear (probably would be too hot and sweaty for active wear) I might buy another pair sure but I wanna see if there is any better kinds out there. I also like that the material doesn\u2019t attract pet hair. I live in Michigan so just this pair is perfect to keep my legs warm in fall/ winter as well, no need to double up or buy fur or felt lined kinds that just don\u2019t fit right",

The L felt kind of loose in the legs and the \u201cscrunch\u201d part sat too high on my butt and the waist compression part was too high and made the front really unflattering as it created a severe upside down muffin top lol. The M fit way better and are super flattering so shorter girls may want to size down. The grey ones look good but the scrunchy part is pretty visible (more on camera in real life but still noticeable) whereas the darker colors are better blended.",
