                "reviewText": "I got these leggings based off the reviews saying they didn't go sheer in squats. As a Barre instructor I need to have leggings that won't turn sheer when I plie, squat, bend, fold and otherwise move. This ones fit the bill perfectly. They don't dig in anywhere. There is a light compression but without making me feel crushed, with provides some light muscle support and looks flattering, too. The side pockets are deep and wide enough to easily fit a phone but without being so deep that you have to do a giant side bend to be able to reach anything at the bottom of the pocket. They've washed up well (no piling, discoloration, shrinkage, or threads coming loose) and are holding up well to my multiple times a week use. Really happy with how great these turned out given that they are so affordable, too.",

They are smooth, soft, cozy, with fabulous stretch without any bagginess elsewhere, move with every move you make, those two can\u2019t-live-without side pockets, and all this for a very reasonable price! I\u2019ve paid twice as much for less than half the quality of these and I\u2019m incrementally replacing every pair of excercise & relax time pants with these! The sizing is very forgiving because of the fabulous stretch, the seams are double stitched\u2026I haven\u2019t had a single issue with any of them and pretty rough with them, they wash up beautifully in cold water, I hang them up to dry just out of habit, but I\u2019ve thrown them in the dryer and they were just as happy! I highly recommend them to everyone and can\u2019t imagine you being disappointed!!",

They aren\u2019t sheer at all, but they are slightly bigger around the ankle than I prefer (but that is typical with certain types of material.) The stitching is consistent and the pockets are very well constructed! The pockets do sit lower on the thigh, but I think I\u2019m preferring that more than the pocket placement on my other go-to brand of leggings. If you have a hairy dog, they tend to really grab onto hair and lint, so that\u2019s something to be mindful of. Overall, I\u2019m satisfied with my purchase!",

They do not ride up on my legs like others. I was Leary of the high waist since most are snug and uncomfortable. But they are super comfy and stay in place. The pockets are large enough for my phone without worrying it will fall out. Also has a small bonus pocket on the inside of waist for a card or locker key. Will definitely buy more.",
