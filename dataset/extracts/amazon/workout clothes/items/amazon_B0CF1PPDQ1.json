These did NOT disappoint! They are so soft, so comfortable, stretchy. They don't fall down at all, they actually do have tummy control (I'm post baby currently and loving the tummy control aspect of these!). The high waisted is actually high waisted. They'd work great for taller people, I'm 5'5\" and they're just a tad bunched at my ankles. I'm also 226lb and I ordered an XL (glad I did, they fit great). They're almost a compression legging but not uncomfortably compressed and they're not see through at all. Don't let the price cause you to hesitate, the quality is amazing and the price is great for what you get!",

                "reviewText": "The material is incredibly soft and comfortable, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say these leggings were well suited to the gym. Rather, they\u2019re fabulous for around the house or running errands with a long sweater over them. They\u2019re quite thin, so every little wrinkle, bump, or line shows, so seamless knickers or thongs only ;)All in all though, they will be a wardrobe staple, just not for the gym, and the price for three pairs is very reasonable. Recommended.",
