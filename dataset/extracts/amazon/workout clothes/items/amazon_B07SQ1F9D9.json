Does this tank have a shelf bra? No, but it works well with sports bras, they are super soft, comfortable, stretchy and smooth and cool to the touch. Is white see through? No, the material is not see through, fabric content has good coverage. If you are still a bit worried, we suggest you buy a darker color.",

The large was just right, and the back detail is super cute! Flowy but not baggy, and the length is good. Already purchased a second color and the size was exactly the same fit as the first. For reference I am a 36dd and ordered a large. This will be a go-to summer top!!!",
