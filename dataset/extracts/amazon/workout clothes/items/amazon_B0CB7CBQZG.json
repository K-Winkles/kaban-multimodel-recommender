                "reviewText": "I have this brand of bodysuit in medium so I assumed a medium in this would be perfect. These are definitely on the small side. They are still quite flattering, and I love the compressive fabric. I could probably size up, but decided to keep the medium. Let me just tell you - that zipper is putting in WORK ;)They layer well under things, and I love that you can adjust how much cleavage you wanna show with the zipper. Just consider sizing up if you find yourself between sizes.",
