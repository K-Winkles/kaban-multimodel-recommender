                "reviewText": "I just love these tops. They hug my body with mild compression and do not feel like a struggle to get them off. They are good at wicking sweat away from you body. Dry pretty fast also. It is perfect as a base layer for my work where the temperature fluctuates between 65-75 degrees. My body temperature stays very comfortable doing warehouse work for 10 hour shifts. I do not get as sore either.I have a 39-42 inch chest and weigh 145-155 and a 29-31 inch waist. Depending on the work week if it is a heavy lifting week or more of a cardio week. Or a mix I gain and lose weight frequently depending on the warehouse needs every couple of weeks and these hold up well. I love the length on my body too. I am 5-7 and with the above measurements, they come down just below my crotch.",

                "reviewText": "Hello please excuse my friends room. Anyways i was really iffy about these shirts as i heard it\u2019s really tight and good fitted however if you buy the wrong size you\u2019re kinda screwed. If you normally wear small shirts in men. Get a medium. That\u2019s what I did. If you\u2019re 170 lbs or more. I suggest a large not extra large.How to know your size? Well here\u2019s mine. Over the years of gymming my chest grew. I am 155lbs + 5\u20196 tall. I love tight fitted shirts to the gym. Grab a string or something lengthy and put it around your chest. Imagine a ruler/ 12inch and just estimate on that. That\u2019s how I found my perfect size.I hope this helps! Not many reviews were specific of their heights and weight. Yes it plays a role! The shirts are definitely not too lengthy except the long sleeves. Those sleeves are pretty long so I\u2019ll have to just roll it up as I gym, goodluck!",
