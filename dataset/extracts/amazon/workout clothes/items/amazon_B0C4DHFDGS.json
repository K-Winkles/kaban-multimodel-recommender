                "reviewText": "I usually don\u2019t write reviews just ratings. This is actually the first one I\u2019ve written. I had to write this because I was skeptical of these pants and they ended up being so perfect. I\u2019m 5\u20198.5 and 120 lbs. I ordered XS & 34\u201d. It\u2019s usually hard for me to find pants that fit well. As a taller girly it\u2019s not easy to find pants small enough that are also long enough. I read so many reviews on these pants. Mostly good but some weird and questionable. First of all the crotch is perfectly fine. No camel toe and no large or messed up stitching. I went back and fourth between S & XS but I knew the pants were supposed to be stretchy so I went with the XS. I\u2019m glad I did because they fit perfectly. I will wear them with my chunky sneakers. When I have my shoes on they cover the tops of the sneakers which I love. When I have no shoes on they sit on the ground which I also love. The length is PERFECT. The flare is bigger than I thought it would be but it\u2019s very flattering. When I initially took the pants out of the bag I was worried the flare would be too much but it\u2019s not at all. It\u2019s very nice. No sheer or see through but I also have the color black so it might not be like that for lighter colors. The texture is nice and soft. It\u2019s thin but not as thin as I thought it would be. Just your basic work out material really. I won\u2019t wear these to work out in but they would definitely be fine for that. They\u2019re breathable, comfortable and flexible. If you\u2019re looking for something for cold weather these aren\u2019t it but I\u2019m not. The crossover waist is SOOO CUTE. My waist is snatched in and it doesn\u2019t roll over or anything. Its regular high waist not too high and the crossover makes them show more stomach than regular straight waist pants which is so flattering. The waist isn\u2019t too tight. I probably could\u2019ve fit the small. But I\u2019m happy with the XS and will definitely order more in a different color. I\u2019ll probably gift these for my sister around the holidays as well. I have an event coming up that I needed these for and ordered them later than I should\u2019ve however they came in a day earlier than expected which was awesome. There are no holes, weird spots or crooked stitching. I could definitely wear these to bed they\u2019re so comfortable. I really am so so happy with them and can\u2019t wait to wear them. I already know I will get so many wears out of these. I would say they fit true to size and are nice and stretchy even though they fit snug. If your questioning weather to get them or not I would say go for it! They are PERFECT!",

                "reviewText": "Ok, so these are not going to keep you warm in winter, but they look soooooo good! The fabric crossover at the waist is flattering and gives you that hourglass illusion. Although the fabric is kind of thin, I found that cellulite does not show in the black. The fabric is somewhat slick so pet hair brushes off pretty easily, however, I wouldn't say that the fabric is overly shiny, so I don't feel like I am wearing a pair of jazz pants like I did for dance as a kid. They do not have a front seam. Hooray!!! No camel here! The 32 in inseam worked great for me as I am 5 ft 4 in and like wearing these with a sneaker. I typically wear a size 0/2 or an XS. The XS fit great and was true to size for me. There is plenty of stretch in the fabric, so in my opinion there is no need to size up.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Sunzel Flare Leggings, and I must say, they've become an essential part of my daily wardrobe. These leggings are a real game-changer!One of the standout features for me is the perfect length. As someone who's 5'2\" and weighs 179 lbs, I often struggle with finding leggings that fit just right. These, however, hit the mark. No need to deal with extra fabric pooling around my ankles; they provide an ideal, flattering length.What's truly impressive about these leggings is their combination of tummy control and a high-waisted design. It's like a gentle hug that provides support and smoothes out any areas of concern. These leggings manage to be both comfortable and stylish, a rare feat.The wide leg design is a nice departure from the usual slim-fit options. It adds a touch of elegance and makes these leggings suitable for yoga sessions as well as casual wear.The fabric quality is another selling point. It's substantial and durable, yet breathable, ensuring these leggings hold up well over time.As for the fit, I can confirm that these leggings are true to size. They hug the right curves without feeling restrictive, thanks to the stretch in the fabric. I've felt confident and comfortable in them, whether I'm working out or just going about my daily routine.",

Will be buying more, purchased the dark brown and they are INSANE. Thinner material but its great for keeping cool during leg day or spring and summer workouts/ errands. They are so flattering, so comfortable and i absolutely love. I am 5 feet tall, so I got the 30' inch and they are perfect for me. Love that they have a height range for short and tall girls! I got an XS and they fit flawlessly. Lots of stretch to them. True to size. Get your normal size. If your inbetween, go smaller for the dark colours and up for any light colours.Update: i got them in the black as well: so comfy. Very very very similar feeling as lulu aligns: even better than lulu aligns imo",
