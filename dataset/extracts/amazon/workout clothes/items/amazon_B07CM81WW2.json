Most comfortable leggings I\u2019ve ever owned, much better than some of the more expensive ones. No need to tug, reposition, etc. every time I move around. Loved them so much, I decided to buy another pair- then I bought two more. Very soft; nice compression. The reviews certainly are all over the place on size, so I will give this info in case it helps someone. I am 5\u20194\u201d, and range from 130-135 lbs. The Medium fits perfectly! I typically wear a size 8 petite or MP in almost all clothing. Leggings are often too long in the stride for me, even petite-sized ones, which makes the waist come up too high, and petite leggings are often too short for me.. Not these. Just perfect for me in every way.",

                "reviewText": "In March of 2023, I purchase 4 pairs of leggings that are size small. When I received them & tried them on, I fell in love. I am 125 pounds & they fit amazing. They have tight compression throughout the thighs & legs which I love. They have pockets on both sides that can hold my chapstick, phone, vape & keys. They do not slide down at all, they stay in place on your tummy area. So I decided to purchase 5 more pairs in the same size.. when I received these in the mail, they were totally different. They weren\u2019t as long, or tight fitting. It was kinda loose in the thigh & leg area. It also included an extra pocket which is cool but I didn't like how loose they fit. So I am exchanging them for a smaller size & hoping these work better for me & which they did, they fit like the first pairs I bought! But overall, this is one of the best leggings I\u2019ve own. I\u2019ve worked in many high end retail stores & these Amazon leggings are amazing. I\u2019m a professional house cleaner & deal with bleach & other chemicals and they have not bleach once, they are squat proof & just comfortable! They are extremely soft as well.",

I definitely want a snug /tight fit; so I will be ordering a size small . I'm keeping the mediums for my \" fat days \" - lol !The material is not see through, which is great. They seem like they will not collect lint , and probably not likely to pill or collect sweater balls unless washed with towels etc- will maybe collect on the seams if so. I wear black stretch pants almost daily. These are definitely comfortable , they are high rise to my natural waist , are breathable yet thick enough to not be considered thin. The pockets are great perfect to carry my phone or small items in a pinch. I think the smalls will be more smoothing + snug for me . My hips/butt are 42\" and my natural waist is 32\" . My butt fills out the pants , my waist fits perfectly, my thighs fit , legs could be more snug... And the pants are loose at my knees - and are loose at the groin . If you have bigger thighs + hips , and knees than me- you will fill the looser areas out . The pants are definitely stretchy and long enough they reach my ankles .",

They are made with very good quality material, they are high waisted and hold very well while I'm running. The side pockets for my phone is very handy for a hands free work out. I absolutely LOVE these yoga pants for anything and everything!!!! You will LOVE them!",

                "reviewText": "I will not spend inordinate amounts of money on name-brand athletic clothes. I want high quality without paying for the celebrity endorsements of name brands. These do the job, although I think they should cost $15-$20. They're still not worth $28. They are flattering, comfortable, compression is just right--not too restricting. I just looked down at my seams and I see the seam is frazzled at the knee and this is the first time I'm wearing this pair (blue), so not sure what that will lead to. Overall I like the look and feel of these. I ordered 3 pairs so far: black, blue, and olive. Colors are like pics. I'm withholding five stars given the seam issue (given the price) and I'm going to see how they do after a few wears and washes.",

                "reviewText": "These are perfect for winter sport as they are thicker than cheap leggings. the pockets are nice and phone friendly. These are my favourite leggings bar lululemon and are so much more affordable! They last a good amount of time and when they eventually bobble it isn't extreme or bad. I have four pairs of black ones, I used to wear them while working with children and removing stains was super easy. They are too thick for mid summer wear but will be fantastic through the autumn, winter and spring. They are flattering, not baggy and the medium is perfect for a size 10/12. They are a little long on the legs if you are under 5ft 4 but not in a bad way, you cannot really see it and I don't worry about it, it doesn't look weird or mess with my footwear. I'd so go for it! None of my pairs have ever split! I also have 4 dogs and removing hair from them was nice and easy!",
