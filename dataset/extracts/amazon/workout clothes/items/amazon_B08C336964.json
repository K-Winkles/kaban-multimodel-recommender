Has a great look.Super comfy, really holds me in in a professional athletic way. I like the grippiness of the fabric \u2014 it makes doing yoga, and things like arm balances or tree posture very good, because the fabric nicely holds stickiness in a way that promotes the posture.Many leggings are too slippery or pull when I\u2019m tree post or they fall down etc. not these.I am a professional yoga teacher and workout almost every day. I love wearing these sets for a comfortable and professional looking practice.Waistband stays high. Colors are good. Sports bra looks great and shorts are sexy while not overly revealing. I use them with a bohemian skirt coverup and seamlessly go from gym to classy coverup in moments. Jacket feels great and is lightweight.Overall I\u2019m very pleased. I have this set in multiple colors. Feels sturdy and adds to my confidence in the gym and studio. I\u2019ve never once had to compromise with a wedgie nor any underwear or waist band showing. Shirt stays in place even in inversions. Looks good. Professional set: would buy again and in more colors.Wardrobe staple.",

                "reviewText": "If you are large busted\u2026 better size up. Normally I can wear a medium or large. I decided to go with the large since I now mostly wear 8/10 or 10/12 tops and bottoms. The large top is VERY form fitting and the sport bra does not fit at all on the sides. My breasts are exposed on both sides where they should be concealed. Would be better if maybe the set was split up by tops and bottoms. Bottoms are fine. Jacket fits fine. Just the top and sport bra seem a size small, mainly the bra. If in doubt, size up and just have a bit looser bottoms.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the 5 piece exercise yoga outfit set and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! The set includes a comfortable and stylish yoga top, sports bra, leggings, shorts, and jacket - all made with high-quality, breathable materials that feel great on my skin.The yoga top is flowy and lightweight, making it perfect for a variety of workouts, and the sports bra provides the perfect amount of support. The leggings and shorts fit like a glove and stay in place during even the most intense workouts. I love the high-waisted design, which provides a flattering and secure fit.The whole set is so comfortable and functional, and it's become my go-to for yoga, Pilates, and even running errands.Not only is the quality of the set fantastic, but the price is unbeatable. I've seen similar sets for much more money, but this one is just as good, if not better. I would highly recommend this 5 piece exercise yoga outfit set to anyone looking for a comfortable, stylish, and affordable workout outfit.",
