                "reviewText": "I do like these Real Essentials Dry Fit Women's shirts; they\u2019re not amazing or anything, but for what they are and for the price, they\u2019re nice. They\u2019re comfortable, and they really are cool! I live in Florida, and I have to be outside several times a day to tend to my piggy. I have been delightfully surprised how much cooler these are than any of my regular shirts. And I got all black, by the way.The material is kind of on the thin side and doesn\u2019t have the full opacity of a cotton tshirt. But it\u2019s not sheer or see through; let\u2019s say, it\u2019s opacity is about 90% or something like that. So if you need that full opacity, the black (and maybe other darks?) might be okay; or you might want to just pass on these. (Holding fabric up to the light isn\u2019t at all an accurate test of how it looks being worn, unless you plan on wearing a string of xmas lights underneath\u2026)I\u2019ve been wearing these shirts basically everyday for 5 1/2 months now, and their durability thus far is good. I have not had any issues with seams; nor with holes, snags, or runs. I use a front-loader, but if you use a top-loading washing machine, I suggest either washing on the gentle/delicate cycle, or put them in delicates/lingerie bags, just to be on the safe side, because agitators in top-loaders can be rough on clothes.Regarding sizing, I think this will depend on how you want the shirt to fit. Since so many reviewers said they run small, I first got the large, and it was larger than I was expecting based on the reviews. So I then got the medium, and I have to admit I was surprised it was only a little smaller than the large. The length is fairly similar; the shoulders and body of the medium are narrower by maybe a little less than an inch on each side (laying flat). At some point in the future I will probably get the small too.If you want it to be a little fitted while still being a little loose, then I suggest first just going with your normal size. If you want it to be more loose than fitted, go one size up. If you want it to be more like a classic tshirt fit but without the extra wide shoulders of regular \u201cunisex\u201d tshirts that are really just made for men\u2019s bodies, then go two sizes up.So\u2026 is it flattering? Honestly, if this is something you care about, I think this is one of those types of things where you just have to get it and try it on and see how it looks on you. Because on some bodies, it will look nice; but for some people\u2019s bodies, it just won\u2019t work well for them (according to their preferences).Last point: I\u2019m not sure, but they might have bled in the wash (at least the first time anyway), and that was with cold water. If you get dark colors, it\u2019s probably a good idea to take precaution just in case.The material does dry fairly quickly, and it is polyester after all, so dry on low heat, or just hang if you prefer.",

I love the v neck and the feminine cut of these shirts. Even though I'm wearing a workout shirt, I still feel like a girl. I have embroidered our company logo on these, and they stood up the the embroidery needle just fine (though I did use a good facing so that they didn't pull and bunch). I like the colors, the fabric, the cut and the price.",

                "reviewText": "It's always interesting when I try to base my purchase decisions by balancing what I Want with Buyer Reviews and Question/Answers. First, I was looking for comfortable shirts. Then I was looking for fit. Then I was looking for thickness. In addition, I was looking specifically for inexpensive, quality shirts that would fit and be comfortable enough for me to SLEEP in.Sheerness first because that's what made me laugh. The first shirt I held up (lavender from what's currently listed as Set 1) was so sheer that I could see my entire living room through it. However, let me qualify my lol by stating that I was holding it up to a light because I was looking for cosmetic blemishes (I didn't find blemishes in any of the 5 shirts). That said, if you're going to be out and about during bright daylight, it will be somewhat see through. In addition if it fits you tightly around the bust or middle, it will be see through indoors as well. My concerns about sheerness had mostly to do with the fact that I'd be braless in them.The fit is always hit or miss. I have to look through a ton of Reviews and Question/Answers before I decide whether to buy a S, M, or L. There were enough comments to convince me I'd be safest ordering 1 size up for comfort. Even if the shirt turned out to be a bit large on me, that probably would be okay because it wasn't something I'd be wearing out of the house. As long as I can keep the clothing item on my body, loose is most comfortable around the house for me. If I was going to wear these out, I'd order a medium (I'm 5'3\" 135lbs mostly pear shaped). I'm not large-breasted, so I probably wouldn't stretch out the shirt enough for my bra to show through it...on a cloudy day.Regarding comfort: I was looking for lightweight, and soft. Some might automatically go for a cotton blend, but I have other shirts of this blend (that are NOT see through), and I find them extremely comfortable to wear and simole to care for. They also don't wrinkle. These met my criteria in this category.For the price point when I bought them, it think the overall quality looks pretty good. There weren't loose threads on any of the seams or cuffs. In my experience, whether that holds up through laundering will have mostly to do with the quality of thread the manufacturer uses. I keep a simple sewing machine in my utility room, so I can do quick zigzags to help with further unraveling. For this price, I expect one or more of them will end up beneath the needle at some point; although, the thin fabric could deteriorate first.I'm keeping them for the reasons I bought them, but I won't be wearing them without a bra if family or friends stop by for a quick visit. One turn sideways from a lamp, and the transparent silhouette of the girls would make my adult sons uncomfortable. I have cotton blends that will work better for those occasions. I do expect they will be very comfortable to sleep in. If not, I'll be back.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these shirts for a long staycation In Arizona. My husband ran out of clean T shirts and so I let him wear one of these. He loved these so much that I had to order more! Actually we BOTH love them. I was surprised that these ones fit him better than the ones for men that I had just ordered for him. They look more \u2018hip\u2019 on him, with a shorter sleeve and a flared bottom that helps to hide his slight paunch! The color blocking inserts in the side also help with slimming. Also, he says: The material is cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s cold outside. Plus, he loves the fact that his underarms never seem to smell in theses shirts!So, if your guy is looking for something with a little better fit and style, that you can\u2019t get in a \u2018regular guy tee,\u2019 order him a set if these! No one will ever know, unless you write a review like I did!Also, these tees are great quality. They launder well with no shrinkage or fading. They fit us true to size and are a great deal for the price. I would highly recommend!",
