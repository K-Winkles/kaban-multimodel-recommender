I ordered a small for more of a snug compression fit. The small fitted so lovely! I wore mine at work all day, and the waist ddnt roll down not once. It's that tight hold the material has to the body.The material is soft and delicate, it has a firm, tight, stretchy hold to the body. A medium would be ok, but bcuz it stretches the small worked like a charm.The material isn't cheap looking, and has a lined feel to it.I am in love, will be ordering again.",

They are really soft and the fit is great but you will spend a lot of time picking off hair, lint, and whatever else you come into contact with. They do run a bit big and I should have ordered a medium and even though the large fit is okay, the medium would have been a better choice. It's really too bad as my first impression with them was to order run back and another pair asap, but after washing them, that is not going to happen.",

                "reviewText": "The inseam was very far forward towards the front of my thighs, and it pulled the gusset forward along with it, leaving a large gap between the front of my crotch and the leggings. When I did some test squats, the fabric made an audible sound like someone snapping a belt. Even when I tried to rotate the leggings legs around so the inseam was closer to the interior of my thighs, it just pulled forward again. Pulling the pants up high on my waist had no effect. This issue led to me returning them.There were also some other fit issues that would not have lead to me returning them. The waistband elastic is a very small portion of the 4-5\u201d waistband fabric, which causes the leggings to be very tight where the waistband is and then balloon outwards for the rest of the fabric, unenforced waist. This emphasized the appearance of fat on my lower belly and was both uncomfortable and unflattering. The leggings were also very tight from the knee down, which is not a problem I\u2019ve ever had before.",

I also had a baby a few years ago and didn't drop the baby weight (20 pounds heavier then I was before and was average to thin before). On top of that I have super sensitive skin and can't handle a lot of tight clothes or itchy materials. Well, I decided to give these a go because the reviews were really good. When I first opened the bag, I thought they looked kind of small and a different material than I am used to. But then I put them on, and they were perfect. They held my tummy in gently and fit so well all over. The material does not irritate my skin at all and is the perfect thickness. Not too thin, not too thick. Definitely happy I bought them.",

They are compression and give enough support without being too tight. I find them to be a bit too long for me. I'm 5\"5 but with they were available in a 25\" leg. I also did not find them to be squat proof. I got the white pair so perhaps other colours are not as see-through. They are find for upper body days for sure! I love them!!",
