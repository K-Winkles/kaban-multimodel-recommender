                "reviewText": "TL;DR: Nice androgynous square cut; light, cool fabric wicks really well. Sizing is bigger than I expected. 10/10; highly recommended; will buy again.I'm a guy, but it's hard to find inexpensive mens' wicking tanks in sizes suitable for ballet dancers (US men's small is often too big; children's sizes can be too narrow in the shoulders), so I figured I'd give these a shot.As pictured, the cut of the tanks looked pretty gender-ambiguous, and I'm happy to report that it definitely is in real life. If you're looking for a curve-enhancing cut, this tank isn't the best choice, but if you want a straight, fairly boxy cut, you'll be quite happy. The taper of the front seams is actually pretty flattering on a guy with a tapered torso, in fact.For the price, I wasn't sure what to expect--but the fabric and finish is surprisingly nice. These tanks are light and breathable, and more importantly they do a great job staying cool in a hot ballet studio and wicking away the ridiculous, embarassing quantities of sweat that my body insists on producing ( TMI? ^-^' ).Sizing is more generous than I expected. In US ladies' sizes, I'd normally choose a S or M for a tank top depending on the fit of the armholes--I'm slim but quite broad-shouldered. for some reason, I decided to go with XL for these. I think maybe I confused them with a different tank I was considering that was reported to be tight through the armholes?Anyway, at 5'8\", currently 160 pounds, broad-shouldered (19.5\" from point to point), but measuring only 36\" around the chest, I have quite a lot of room to spare in size XL. The length is quite generous--it will stay tucked if you tuck it in, and if you don't, it will keep you covered. On me, it could definitely be a little shorter and still be fine.These are very definitely my new go-to for daily classes and rehearsals. I will order a second set of these as soon as there's room in the budget, but I'll probably drop down to a size M to achieve the really close fit.Overall, a pleasant surprise, 10/10, highly recommended and will definitely buy again.",

                "reviewText": "These are my new preferred workout tank tops. I typically wear size 8-10 in tops and choose medium sizes in most cases. I'm in my mid-60's, 5'7\", 125 lbs. with an athletic build. After reading several reviews for the IcyZone workout tank, and being unfamiliar with this brand, I initially purchased these in a size large. The large size fit somewhat loosely at the bust, but they were way too big around the waist and hips and not at all flattering. Since I'd already washed the tanks and couldn't return them, I gave the large size tops to a friend, who normally wears size 12, and they fit her perfectly. I purchased another set in a size medium and they fit great. These tanks are well made and come in an excellent selection of colors. I also like that they are cut longer to the hips ...those days of wearing tops that expose my midriff are long gone :`)",

                "reviewText": "3.5 stars, almost a four, but not quite there!To start with the positives:These tanks are extremely well constructed, with reinforced stitching and perfect cuts.They look amazing, even though I would prefer them a little larger. For perspective, I am 5' 11\" athletic build and a 36C/D, I typically wear a large, but sometimes need XL. I wanted this to be looser. It was not. Still wearable, just snugging the chest and sits right up close to your body. I have ordered another set of colors in XXL to see how it fits, I suspect the fit will be perfect.Excellent value for the price.The colors are true to the pics and beautiful.They are stretchy, but hold their shape. Will not stretch out.Negatives:If you want them to not be flush to your skin and chest you will have to order up a sizeThe material is not silky or like typical dry fit material, it is thicker. The inside is rougher and a little scratchy. The outside is smoother, but still not a smooth as I was expecting. It isn't a deal breaker, but if you have sensitivity issues it might irritate you, I am hoping the larger size will feel better against my skin because it won't touch constantly. It reminds me of old volleyball uniform material from like the mid to late eighties! If you are old enough, do you remember those long sleeves on your arms? Like that!Slight variation in sizing, another reason to size up if snug fit is a no go for you.If they had been a little less fitted I would have given it four stars, maybe a five. I am not a fan of the material, for something that is meant to be against you skin it is a little to scratchy for me.",
