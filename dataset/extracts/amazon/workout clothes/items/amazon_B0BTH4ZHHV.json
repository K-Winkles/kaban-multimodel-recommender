                "reviewText": "So tired of not having pockets in dresses! When I go out, I do not want to babysit my purse or get annoyed by a wristlet. These shorts were reasonably priced, fit well, preserved modesty (but didn't show under a babydoll-cut mini dress), were soft and comfortable, and held up to hours and hours of dancing (woo! Club/Rave night) without being too warm. I had my cell phone in in one pocket, and my slimline ID/card holder wallet and lip gloss in the other pocket, and I was good to go. Normally wear size M/L (US size 8/10 with curvy, muscular hockey-butt and quads) but I do not like super snug clothing. I ordered a large, washed them in cold water and dried them on medium heat, and they were perfect. Highly recommend for anyone who has a similar dilemma \ud83d\ude02",

                "reviewText": "I am 100% in love with these shorts, please don\u2019t ever quit making them! I have purchased so many pairs of campsnail shorts, and leggings. I\u2019ve even introduced my friends and these are our favorite go to leggings/shorts! Keep \u2018em comin! I do wish they made some in this material with the butt ruching though. But on to the review-Pros: These buttery soft bike shorts with pockets have light compression and are a great choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and supportive pair of shorts for cycling/yoga/gym etc. The soft material feels great against your skin, while the light compression provides just the right amount of support for your muscles and lower tummy, without giving you a muffin top. The pockets are also a great feature, providing a safe and secure place to store your phone, keys, or any other small items you may need while on the go. These last well over time. They are breathable and have not caused any sweat buildup or chafing for me. I also wear the shorter versions of these under dresses to help prevent thigh chafing. These are so versatile and definitely are well worth the purchase.Cons: These may not be the best choice for folks who prefer a more snug and supportive high compression fit. Additionally, the pockets may add some extra weight and bulk to the shorts, which can be uncomfortable for some folks who prefer les fabric.",

I got them specifically to wear at a music festival and they were great. However, I was sweating in them and some dye seems to have transferred to the white body suit I was wearing underneath, leaving a stain that barely lightened after bleaching. I could see them stretching out and losing shape in the future.",

I pull them up to practically my boobs, but you don\u2019t have to do that, I just love the support from it, and you can\u2019t even tell I have them up that high. They aren\u2019t too short and are not too long either, which was so important to me because these days all shorts are too short for us moms that still dress like this and aren\u2019t stuff suit types or who just want to feel cool in this heat and look good doing so. They are cute with sweatshirts, tshirts, they do show a panty line but that\u2019s honestly never really even mattered to me because my shirts are usually longer anyway. The pockets don\u2019t make them sag or fall down either!! I promise you won\u2019t just buy one pair!",
