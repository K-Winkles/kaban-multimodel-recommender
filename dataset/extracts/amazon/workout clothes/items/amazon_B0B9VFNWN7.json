Their size chart does not reveal the 4XL Tall so can't really see what the length will be. Will try them, and hopefully will have the extra length needed since I am over 6ft tall.",

                "reviewText": "Opened them up and was surprised how sturdy and nice they were. Fit great. Wore one pair to the gym and loved them. The next day I wore the second pair and when I got to the gym and sat down, I realized that the inseam from just below the crouch had not been sewed together for about 6 inches.A bit embarrassing. Contacted the company directly and were out of the color I needed. They promptly gave me a partial refund. Quick and accommodating customer service. Would have been 5 star if not for the faulty pair.UPDATE: well I wore the two pair that were usable and they seemed fine\u2026\u2026until\u2026.i washed them! Both pairs coming apart at the waste band. It is unfortunate because the material they are made from is great. The manufacturing and assembly is atrocious. They probably won\u2019t stand up to too many washings seeing that are Leeds coming apart on the first wash. So disappointed!! Changed review to one star. I\u2019d stay away from these if I was you.",

                "reviewText": "I purchesed two sets, so a total of 6. The pants are comfortable but for me, they could have a longer crotch so they are not pulling up aginst the scrotum every time I sitAfter the very first wash one pair had the stiching of the waist start to undo and fall out. After the third time washing a couple more did the same.Now, the pair in the photo was one of them. After getting home I noticed the hole in the pocket and the stiching again coming outSo of 6 pairs I have 4 that are losing the stitching. The blue pair being the worst so far.As I said, first impressions they were comfortable and then the stiching started to undo.On a different note, the shoestrings used to tighten the waistline is much to short if you are on the larger side OR you just leave them untied when not wearing them. Just a slight pull on the waistline will cause the dtring to varnish into the pants. Now you need go fishing for it.",
