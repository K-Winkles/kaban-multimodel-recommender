                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying, I never knew a pair of leggings could change my life \u2013 until I met the NORMOV 4 Piece Butt Lifting Workout Leggings! These leggings are like a magical combo of comfort, style, and a little extra lift in all the right places.First things first, the comfort level is off the charts! I've worn leggings that felt like I was wrestling with a boa constrictor just to get them on, but not these beauties. They slide on like a dream, and once they're on, it's like being wrapped in a cloud of butt-hugging joy. I could practically do cartwheels in these (if I could do cartwheels).Now, let's talk about the tummy control. It's like having a personal assistant for your midsection. These leggings have this magical power to smooth out any lumps and bumps, making me feel like I just stepped off a runway instead of out of the gym. The tummy control is so good; I might start wearing these to Thanksgiving dinner!The booty lift is no joke either \u2013 it's like a little workout miracle. I put these on, and suddenly I've got that gym scrunch booty without even hitting the squat rack. Who needs lunges when you've got NORMOV leggings doing the heavy lifting for you?And the colors! Oh boy, the colors. It's like a rainbow exploded in my closet. I've got options for every mood and occasion. Feeling sassy? Go for the bold red. Feeling chill? Opt for the calming blue. They even have a shade for when you're feeling mysterious \u2013 because leggings should match your enigmatic vibes, obviously.And let's not forget the sizing \u2013 true to size is an understatement. These leggings understand my body better than I understand it myself. No guessing games here; just order your usual size and prepare for the leggings of a lifetime.if you're in the market for leggings that feel like a warm hug for your legs, sculpt your booty into a work of art, and come in more colors than a crayon box, look no further than NORMOV. These leggings are so good; I might just buy a second set to wear while doing my laundry in the first set. They're that fabulous!",

                "reviewText": "I was really looking forward to getting these. The amount for the price is great, the color options are good, and reviews are convincing. I opened the box immediately and when I pulled out one pair, I first thought I should have ordered a bigger size (I ordered large) because they seemed small. My second thought was how great the material is, thick enough. I tried one pair on and they slipped on just fine, They felt comfortable, I loved the high waist, and my booty looked pretty good, and then I turned to look at the front in the mirror and there it was, the c\ud83d\udc2bmel. I tried adjusting the area, but it was just too obvious. It's not the pants fault lol I'd still recommend them. Give it a chance, it might work for you.",
