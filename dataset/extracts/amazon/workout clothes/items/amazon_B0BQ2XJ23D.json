I find them thick enough to not be sheer, but not at all hot. Having pockets are excellent, and as they\u2019re high-waisted, they help me feel more smooth and lean.For reference, I am 5\u20198\u201d, 215lbs, and \u201cpear-shaped\u201d and ordered a size large.The legs do ride-up some as I have thick thighs. But this doesn\u2019t bother me as I ordered the shortest inseam, and they never expose my rear.Altogether very satisfied, lightly recommend, and will buy again! \ud83d\udcab",

Very stretchy but fitting as well soft to the touch. Would definitely recommend and I will definitely purchase again!!",

I have super sensitive skin and I loved these shorts. I bought 3 sizes. Small for my daughter who is 5ft and slender. Large and xl for me. Both fit me but I felt more comfortable in a xL. I\u2019m 5\u20192\u2019 and weigh 175. My behind is bigger than most so if u have a smaller bum and my weight and height, then large wld be best.",
