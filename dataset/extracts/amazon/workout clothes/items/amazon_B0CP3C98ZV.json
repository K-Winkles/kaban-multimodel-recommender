                "reviewText": "The headline pretty much sums it up. The colors I got aren't see through, and they flatten my tummy. For context, I'm slim, but not toned. The only reason I'm not posting a picture wearing them is because they look good enough to be a thirst trap lol. Also, I'm often bloated due to my love of salty foods, and they don't make me uncomfortable with a fully belly.One con: I do have to pull them down often due to cameltoe, but that's just the norm honestly.",
