                "reviewText": "I wasn\u2019t sure if I should get longer or shorter but I got the longer pair and they fit perfectly. I\u2019m 5ft 6 and currently weigh 120. In almost 5 months pregnant and I ordered the size small. I\u2019ve lived in these the last 2 months and still have some room around the waist. The material is super soft and buttery. I have lulu lemons and these are as soft if not softer. The fabric is thin but not see through. I have a longer torso so most of my height is my upper body. These shorts come about mid thigh. They are very comfortable and are easy to put on with a oversized t-shirt. I love that it has pockets on both sides. The ONLY problem I had was telling the front from the back because the tag is on the side and I always forget which side is which. I usually cut my tags bc they bother me but have to keep this tag to tell the difference. I\u2019ve washed in cold and they washed well and still look the way they did when I first got them only softer. I haven\u2019t noticed any peeling/fuzzies or loose strings and they have been washed/dryed 4-5 times. Great value for the price. I plan to buy the shorter option as well.",

I reordered 2 additional pair which one pair was the 8\" as ordered and the 2nd pair I was not carful when ordering and got the 5\" those are not comfortable at all. They ride up the legs where I have to keep pulling them down. Just make sure which length you want and double check the length you want.",

These are not biker shorts - not enough spandex for the expected support or the tummy control advertised. I should return but I guess they'll make for pj's or lounge shorts. Will not be worn in public. The material is so thin I hope they at least withstand a few machine washes.",
