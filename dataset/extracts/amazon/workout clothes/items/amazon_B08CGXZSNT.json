They weren\u2019t too bad, baggy enough to look cute and if I rolled the waist band it looked normal.Apparently they got a lot of feedback that the pants were too baggy so they reached out asking if mine were too. when they found out that mine were they immediately sent me another pair in the size S to make sure that I was happy (no return necessary). No vendor has ever done this before so I am very happy and pleased.As for the make and model: The pink is exactly like the picture. they are not think but not thick. very comfortable lounge wear. soft on the inside but not super super soft. the waist has no string which i prefer. as i said i have been on the hunt for a pair of pink sweats and these are the best i have found. 10/10 would recommend.please size down!",

Overall, I would rather spend a little extra and get a pair that are SO cozy and thick. I wasn't looking for fluffy sweats, so in that sense they are great because they didn't have a fuzzy lining.
