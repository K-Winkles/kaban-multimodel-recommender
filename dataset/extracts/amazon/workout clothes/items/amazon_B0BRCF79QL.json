                "reviewText": "I didn't expect a lot from these - so many items I buy that are marketed as soft and stretchy end up being too thin and too small. These are perfection! They are buttery soft and feel warm and cozy when I put them on. The waist and leg stitching are not too tight and stretch well with the fabric. I have been a little rough with these - I have washed and dried them and have not seen any damage so far. (I usually wash and then hang to dry just because I know heat and elasticity are not friends.) They've held up better than most similar products I've bought.For context, I wear these primarily under my dresses to prevent chub-rub - if you know what I mean. I've been wearing them more or less weekly for the last month+ and there's no pilling or holes. They look all but brand new, in fact. I can also wear them as pajamas and be very comfortable. They don't tend to bunch up on me and they don't stretch out while wearing them, so they are always a comfortable fit.Coming back in January 2024 to say: These are still holding up to regular wear and have not pilled, thinned, or ripped.",

                "reviewText": "They are very soft and comfortable, and a good deal (I got 4 for less than $20, but it seems they went up some in price).My only complaint with these shorts is that they are a bit see through. I went back and forth about purchasing these when I read the reviews because some said they are and others said they aren't. I'm a pretty harsh critic when it comes to testing transparency. I do a light check and a bend check. You could see my thong, but it wasn't obvious-in-your-face. The patterned shorts covered this better than the solid color ones. For me, any underwear visibility makes me self-conscious, especially when considering working out in them, so I was going to return these shorts. I missed the window on that unfortunately, but I'm not too upset because they're still totally wearable with a long shirt or in a cute outfit with a blazer\u2014or even with just a regular outfit if you don't care as much as I do about them potentially being a bit see-through at certain angles/lights.",

                "reviewText": "These things are incredibly comfortable!! I could have bought either size but went with the M/L. The fabric is exactly like my LuLuLemn Align leggings (the lightest weight - designed for yoga). You honestly almost feel like you are wearing nothing. Very very comfortable. I've worn these shorts under sundresses (perfect) and at the gym (perfect) and to yoga class (perfect) and just around town (also perfect). It's been hot here, and I was concerned they would be sweaty and hot - nope, very comfortable and cool. You can wear them all day and be perfectly comfortable. The fabric is thin, but not see-through at all (just like the LuluLemon fabric). Very stretchy, but does not get baggy or saggy with wear. They absolutely stay in place while wearing -- no rolling at the waist, no creeping up in the legs. These things are SO awesome! They also wash beautifully (cold water, gentle cycle, Woolite, hang to dry). The only tiny negative is that the M/L goes way up on my stomach (maybe 5\" above belly button), but they stay in place, and really are comfortable, so the super-high-height of the waistline doesn't bother me. Like I said, I probably could have gotten the S/M. Anyway - TRY THEM! I promise will love them too. I'm going to buy some as gifts for my girlfriends, they are that great!",

I washed them on cold with a few beach towels and the vibrant colored towels are muted by the color transfer. After washing the towels separately again it only managed to remove some of the tint. I air dried the shorts since I did not want more dye staining my dryer. Washing these are a bit of a bother because I do not want to stain my dryer or color transfer to other clothes. Purchased the size recommended by Amazon and it was a good fit. For reference I am 5\u201910\u201d size 12 hourglass figure and the size L/XL fit comfortably and did not ride up. Shorts were not too short and provided coverage and length for spin class.",

They have deep pockets and are a very soft material. I did get a little hot in them but I was also in 100 degree heat. When wearing these under my dress in AC they aren\u2019t hot. I ended up buying another set for my little sister and also recommended them to my friends. They don\u2019t ride up when you walk and aren\u2019t see through unless you bend over and move to the right light( they are only a little see thru then). All in all I would definitely recommend and will be buying more in the future. They are also tru to size as I wear a 3x jeans size 20-22 and the 3x fit perfectly",
