They are extremely comfortable, very flattering design, and breathable enough that they don\u2019t make me too hot. (I am super super hot-natured and live in Florida were the weather is always miserable)They wash up pretty well. I have tried air drying them, drying them in the machine on delicate, and drying them at normal \u201cmedium\u201d heat. They have not shrank or damaged yet.I like how high-rise they are, they feel very secure in your midsection, without being uncomfortable. They have just the right amount of compression and stretch so if you bloat badly after eating you will love these!Leggings are true-to-size. They are very nicely form-fitting and conform to your shape. I am heavy in the hips, booty and thighs and have a a smaller waist. There was no gaping at the top of the leggings and they held everything together so flatteringly.You will Love these leggings! They are the only ones I wear.",

I expected them to fit snugly however since they are compression leggings. They perform well when I\u2019m walking or jogging on the treadmill though they do roll down a bit which is annoying, so I docked a star for that and the thickness of them. They\u2019re beautiful and came as pictured, but definitely thin. I wouldn\u2019t use these if I were in a gym because of the sheerness of the fabric. They definitely wouldn\u2019t be squat proof but they are breathable and great for at home workouts or private runs. For reference, I got an XL and I\u2019m normally a size 14 in jeans, 200 lbs, and 5\u20195\u201d. They bunch slightly but that\u2019s expected with my height and I like the extra fabric anyway.",

I decided to try purchasing a black pair to see if it would be better at concealing \"female outlines\" and somehow these are perfect. They also don't constantly slide down like other brands I have tried. Perfectly snug, comfortable, and one hundred perfect squat proof. Thank you!!! This brand is great! Very flattering!",

Waistband stays put. 10/10 Recommend! (I bought the Trinity leggings, with the quad seam in the back)",
