It claims to have \u201cquick dry, moisture wicking, UV sun protection\u201d fabric. The larger-than-normal armholes allow for ventilation and a great range of movement. There\u2019s no annoying tag on the back of the shirt to scratch and bother you as you work out or just simply wear this shirt in your everyday life.The hem flares out from about mid-chest to provide more room for those of us with a belly. This is the first top I have actually fell in love with upon trying it. It fits perfectly and feels amazingly soft. The elasticity of this shirt is perfect. It slips over the head and then just settles about the body like a dream. It\u2019s loose and comfortable.This top is great to pair with leggings, jeans, or even capris. To finish the ensemble, you can pair it with sneakers, flats, or even a pair of sandals.This top is machine washable.I would highly recommend this workout top to anyone looking for a comfortable top that is soft and fits great.",

I got a 5x because I wanted it a little big and by the size chart, I should wear a 4x. Even so, the armholes fit nicely, and the neckline is just right, neither are too loose nor snug. It is long enough that it covers me well, and it hits just at my upper thigh. The color is rich very pretty.This top washes well and does not wrinkle easily. An excellent purchase!",
