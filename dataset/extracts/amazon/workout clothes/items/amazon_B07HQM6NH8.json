                "reviewText": "I previously ordered a pair of these pants in a Large around Black Friday. They were running a deal, so I thought I would try them. I love that pair, but they are starting to feel a little loose, as well as my few other brands. (I will add this is my favorite brand as of now, so I keep watching for deals. I\u2019m ballin\u2019 on a budget over here.) I have recently started jogging/running, and my pants would work their way down, and the seams in the crotch area are uncomfortable during running. I decided to size down to a medium to allow for a tight fit. You can tell they are more snug in the pictures, but they are not too tight. I just got these in medium today and already took them for an outdoor run. I absolutely love them! I did not have to adjust one time during my run, and I felt no seams while running. I was able to focus on my workout, and not my wardrobe. \ud83d\udc95 Also, no unseemly wet spots. I appreciate all the pockets as well. There are two side pockets, big enough for me to slide my phone in, and also a pocket on the inside of the high waisted back panel. Pictures were taken after 1.5 mile run. I will definitely be ordering more! For reference: Weight 170-175lbs Height: 5\u20195\u201d",

I am 2 months postpartum and it was hard finding something that was comfortable and fit well for exercising. Doesn\u2019t slip off the waist while running. The pockets fit my iPhone 11 with a bulky case. I am definitely going to be ordering the other colors!!!",

                "reviewText": "I tried both the \u201cthick\u201d regular and \u201cfleece-lined\u201d, the fabric in the regular this version is an elastic knit texture and tends to stretch out over time. Also the regular thick version seems to attract lints but not as bad as othe lr brands I had tried. The fleeced line one is AMAZING! It has a great deal of compression and has a smooth surface like the sweat wicking work out legging. The fleece is definitely not very thick at all compared to Baleaf (worst part of Baleaf is my iPhone 14 small version does not fit in the side pocket) or the CRZ fleeced lined legging. This brans fleece legging will keep you warm between 40-50 degrees but any temperature lower than that, you would need a thermal legging. I also love that it makes my mommy\u2019s y smooth and flat. I do love that both the regular and the fleeced lined version do not come off the waist. I find this brand\u2019s fleece legging has better quality than the Victoria\u2019s Secret, Dragon Fit and Yogalicious fleece leggings. My only complaint is I wish there are more colors for the fleeced lined version. They only make the black color for the fleece lined version.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. TLDR for short attention spans (scroll down for more commentary): they are thick, soft, firm but stretchy, mildly warm, and a little short for a tall girl. Thought about giving it a 4 for that but they are so dang nice I've decided to overlook it. If you are a freeze baby you might want a pair with thicker fleece and likely not rate this a 5 for that. They will hold you in like a soft hug. Nice!The real review with all the important details:These are very nice leggings. The material is thick and substantial, not flimsy or see through like so many leggings. They are super soft as well, both inside and outside. There is a thin fleece lining. It was so soft but I almost couldn't tell it was there (but that contributes to the thickness so, duh)! Since I run super hot I think these will be fine, but some will wish the fleece was thicker I'm sure. Might not be thick enough to sit on cold bleachers without a blanket.They have a pocket on each leg that will fit a huge cell phone, but there is also a pocket on the waste at the small of the back and my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra fit caseless with room to sparea. With my thick case and a pop socket on the back it also fit. Snug but none of it was sticking out. Nice touch!The thickness of these pants feels so good and is very supportive without being too tight. There is TONS of stretch! I am 5'9, 163, apple shaped and carry all my extra lbs in my waist. I don't have a long torso and it went all the way up to my ribs, with some compression but because of the stretch SUPER comfortable! The waistband is thick and doesn't dig or roll, bonus for us girls with a belly! I got a medium and for a second thought they would be too small. They look small but have Hella stretch! If you like your leggings very tight but not uncomfortably so, and are even a little between sizes, size down.It is a little short for my long legs, but that's the life of a tall girl. I wish they were an inch longer but because they are we so nice I'll keep them. The price for the quality is great!I plan to wear these to a football game this weekend and it is only supposed to be in the low 30s. I'll try to remember to update this (I mean actually. Not like all the times someone says that and you notice it has been 4 years since that initial review there is no update. Gah).Thanks for reading! What did I miss? I wish people would leave more detail for clothes, don't you?",
