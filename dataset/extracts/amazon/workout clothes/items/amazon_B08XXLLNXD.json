I got XL because I don't like anything too tight around my tummy and these are so stretchy but not so much that they'd be falling down. The material is so soft but feels like great quality. Stitching also a plus because you never know when buying online. Not sheer in any way. I have not washed yet but with how this product is so far, I doubt that will change my opinion. Comfy house sweats that don't make me too hot but I would also wear these out for a quick errand.",

The strings also don\u2019t have knots or plastic pieces on the ends so after the first wash, the ends frayed. I fixed this just by tying them each in knots. They also seem kind of long for the size. They fit in the waist, but really bunch a round my ankles. I\u2019m 5,4\u201d with a short torso and long legs, for reference.",

                "reviewText": "These pants are my new favorite! I've purchased both the black and red wine colors in XXL (I'm 5'7\" and 245 lbs). They both fit really well, a little baggy and not skin tight, which was what I was looking for. The fabric is nice and soft, and can be worn in cold and warm weather without being too hot. The red color is a bit lighter red than what's in the picture, though. Would highly recommend if you're looking for comfy or light workout pants.",

They seem to run true to size, but I bought the XXL because I wanted them to be super roomy. I'm 5'4\" and weigh about 145 lbs. My true size would probably be large. They say hand wash. I used the machine on cold and express. Then draped them over a clothes rack to dry. I definitely recommend these for lounging at home, going to the gym, etc.",
