                "reviewText": "These yoga pants are adorable! The people complaining about them probably purchased a size down or a size they normally wear (i.e. too tight - that's why they ripped or separated in or near the seams, etc.). Nylon is not as stretchy, soft, or comfortable as polyester, cotton, and spandex, etc. I saw the pics and read all the reviews of the women complaining about these pants. They bought them one to two sizes too small. I normally wear a medium. I bought these in XL. They fit perfectly and they're adorable! The bell bottom is so cute, if that's what you like. I am almost 5'5\" and I bought the 30\" inseam. Even with the shorter length, the pants are slightly long on me. I have somewhat long legs so these pants run long. The waist is perfect and fits comfortably. Don't buy a size down. They're very snug if you buy them too small. These pants are not for very overweight people. They are not see-through unless they're stretched by excess weight. They are mostly nylon with some spandex so there is some compression (not a lot of compression). Very cute style, comfortable, and nice fit! Fast shipping. I am glad I purchased them.",

                "reviewText": "I am so so thrilled to find flare leg yoga pants in a tall size!! I have been searching for a replacement ever since Lululemon decided they hated tall people and stopped making the tall Grooves. I did own a couple pair of the Aerie Real Me crossover flares, but I actually prefer these to those as these are slightly thicker, more durable fabric, the rise to the bottom of the waistband is a little lower which I find more flattering, the flare is a little wider, and I prefer the way the flare is cut (ending slightly higher on the leg than the Aerie version), so I ended up selling those when I got these.However, the stitching at the center of the \"V\" on the inside of the first pair of these I ordered started unraveling after the first wash. I returned that pair and received a new pair, and inspected the replacement to find that the flatlock stitching at that point wasn't properly secured on the replacement pair either. I suspect that is just how they are making them and all pairs likely have some degree of this problem, so I tied off the loose threads and ran them through the seam with a large embroidery needle, problem solved. I will just do that on any future pairs I order, although it is a little annoying to have to fix a brand new item, but it's worth it to me since they are otherwise good, reasonably priced, and long enough for me!While thicker than Aerie's version, this fabric is still relatively thin. I live in a cold climate and these aren't really warm enough to wear outside in cold weather. I find that in sub-freezing temperatures, they aren't even warm enough for the drive to the gym, so these will be a summer-only pant for me. It would be wonderful if the company would make a version in a thicker, warmer fabric as well for winter wear.On the up side, the thinner fabric would be perfect for hiking in the summer, when you want to protect your legs from scratches and poison ivy/oak/etc., but don't want to overheat. The fabric is also smooth and tightly knit so lint and plant debris won't stick to it.I gave four stars because of the loose stitching issue, but otherwise I am thrilled with these and will be purchasing more (especially if they make a thicker cold weather version!).",
