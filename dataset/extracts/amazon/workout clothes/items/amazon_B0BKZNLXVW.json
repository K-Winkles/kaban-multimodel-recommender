I am usually between a size S and XS, but after reading some of the reviews, I decided to purchase the S; it does fit snug but not TOO snug, so a smaller size would have been too tight. My favourite feature is the cups inside! (Removable if desired). It makes my workout outfit much more simple and comfortable without having to wear a sports bra underneath. I will be buying other colours!",
