Not too tight, not to loose very sleek. They can be worn for athletic wear or daily wear as well. I love the double pockets on both sides. I ordered navy as that is one legging color that I do not have but it will match with a lot of the color tops etc that I do have. They are high waisted as well and that helps as well with tummy control. I cannot wait to buy more pairs in different colors and add to the collection!!!!! :)",

These leggings are medium thickness, and I feel like they could be a slightly heavier fabric. That said, they're not sheer. The other \"must\" that I have in leggings is a high waist, which these leggings have. I ordered my usual size in leggings (XL or XXL) and they fit great.",

                "reviewText": "The size 8 black leggings by Alaviking are made in PRC (china). The leggings are made from a 72% polyester and 28% spandex fabric. The fabric has been \"brushed\" to make it soft to the touch, and as a result, the fabric is a magnet for pet hair. The leggings are very stretchy, and a size 8 fits my normal size 8 frame well. I did have a little sliding on the waistband. The leggings are comfortable for all day wear. The leggings passed my squat test, and the thin material is dense enough to not show what is underneath. I would have preferred the black color on the inside of the waistband, as the pink showed when they slid down.4 stars",

                "reviewText": "Ordered these yoga pants in small and they fit as expected. Leggings and yoga pants seem to be very popular these days, and this particular pair is very nice looking.The color is true to the product images: I ordered black, and they are in fact black. As per the description, these have pockets. They're skin tight, by design, but they manage to be flattering as well - perhaps that's the double layer at work, who can say?Overall, I'm very happy with these pants. They're not the cheapest you can buy, but they're well made and a great value for $30. Would buy again and/or recommend.",
