                "reviewText": "There are so many biker shorts on Amazon, I decided to try a bunch to really figure out what would work for me. I compared these to the Colorfulkoala Seamless Biker Shorts 8\", Sunzel 10\" Biker shorts, the CRZ Naked Feeling 6\" Bike shorts, and the Kamo Fitness Serenity shorts, all in a size small (I'm about a 26.5\" waist, 35\" hip, 5'5\" tall).Of all the shorts, these 8\" Deep Pocket shorts are the most brushed and \"stiff\" feeling fabric. In the black color, they are a tiny bit tighter than all the other shorts, including a pair of Sunzel 10\" bike shorts (no pockest). The fabric just doesn't feel quite as comfortable, stretchy and breathable as a lot of the other options. But I do approve of the no-front-seam and side pockets.The most flattering of all the shorts were the Kamo Fitness Serenity Shorts. The seams are all in the right places for a flattering booty and minimal camel issues. But a complete lack of pockets really kills me.Overall I preferred the CRZ Naked Feeling shorts with pockets. There is a front seam, but the fabric is stretchy enough to minimize CT and the seams are flattering. It's a smooth, sleek, breathable material. They are a 6\" inseam so not ideal if you need something longer, but I did go running in them and they didn't ride up.The Colorfulkoala Seamless shorts had a thinner, brushed fabric that is good for hot weather, and no front-seam and side pockets! Also a good choice.I liked the Sunzel 10\" Biker shorts more than these 8\" shorts but am bummed they don't have pockets (but yes to a waistband pocket). A lightly brushed fabric but feels much more stretchy and looks very flattering.Hard to choose between all these but hopefully my notes can give you a little more clarity!",

Very comparable to some of Lu lu lemons shorts.The material is extremely comfortable and soft.It has enough elasticity to give a good shape without feeling restricted. It\u2019s been hard finding form fitting shorts without the tight pressure on my stomach. So other brands I can\u2019t wear during my period or when I\u2019m bloated without it hurting.These shorts!!! Keep it snug without being uncomfortable tight. I can wear them no matter what my body is going through and never have a complaint.They recently switched up their design and it is even better than the last!! The pockets are higher up so it never feels like my phone is weighing my shorts down. They also changed the seem in the back to be a v shape vs a horizontal line. They are so much more flattering and even more functional.100% recommend these shorts and their joggers.I\u2019m 5\u201d4 128lbs and I buy the medium. I\u2019m wearing the shorter style currently. I don\u2019t have a problem with the shorter ones riding up either",

                "reviewText": "When I first thought about buying these shorts I wanted to get the 8\" inseam but they didn't have the 2 pack in black so I ended up getting the 5\". These shorts are tighter in areas in which you don't want them to be tight in. The thighs roll up after doing activities and even when I sit down: same in the stomach area. They, also, are NOT squat proof and you can clearly see panty color. I also have a larger badonkey so that does not help the scenerio. I usually am able to fit in a large but seeing how the material does this I would suggest sizing up. When I first put these shorts on I also noticed some material in the thigh was loose and frilling so that's concerning because I know it will only get worse.On the other hand... I love the material. They are extremely soft and would be an amazing lounging short or low intensity workout short (yoga or pilates).",

I am able to bend over/squat without my skin/underwear showing. I would personally say they are well produced with good materials from first glace and wear. I have not washed these shorts yet, so I cannot say how well they would hold up in the wash/dryer.Comparing - If you have ever owned or felt Aerie's soft leggings / shorts, I would say they are similar to the feel of those. I would even say they are probably as comfortable as lululemon's leggings.Fit - I would say these fit true to size. I got a medium and they fit like a dream. Since they are stretchy, they are a bit more forgiving. They are not \"compression shorts\" by any means, but they still provide support and shape. These shorts, for me personally do not ride up on my legs and do not ride down on my stomach (which is something I find a lot of high waisted bike shorts do). These are super high waisted and go probably about an 1.5inches or more above my belly button easily. These do have pockets on each side, which fit my smart phone no problem.Working out - These shorts seem to withstand sweat when working out and are super breathable. They are very easy to move around in and I don't find they dig into my skin at all. I would say they are great for working out overall.",
