The bra still has a lot of support even when the padding is removed, which I was worried about as I have a bigger chest but hate fake padding.The leggings aren't loose in the knees like some leggings can be and the high waist really holds everything in. The stretch is amazing, I probably could have sized down but I played it safe and it fits perfectly.The leggings are super flattering and an unexpected PRO that I didn't think about when I ordered is that there's no center seam so they don't cause camel toe. The fabric doesn't feel cheap and actually feels nicer than some of my \"name brand\" leggings.Overall I think it's an absolute steal at this price and I'm really impressed. I'm always apprehensive about ordering clothes online but this exceeded my expectations. I will definitely be ordering this again in the other colors!",

                "reviewText": "Los leggins son de cintura alta, en lo personal no me gusta mucho usarlos as\u00ed, y se hacen unas peque\u00f1as arrugas en la parte del pelvis, pero por lo dem\u00e1s, el ajuste en las piernas es muy bueno y c\u00f3modo para entrenar. El top queda muy pegado a las axilas y eso es inc\u00f3modo ya que tienes el roce de la tela todo el tiempo, si fuera un poco m\u00e1s corto de esa parte estar\u00eda mejor, pero no se ve grande, sino que as\u00ed es el dise\u00f1o.",
