I\u2019m usually a size large, and these fit as they should? Pretty stoked on this purchase. It\u2019s a modest crop, they hit about 2ish inches below my bellybutton. Sleeves are a good length too, I find most long sleeve lengths to be short but not these. I do wish the pack color options had an all dark color palette, because I\u2019d buy another pack if there was.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these to wear over tennis/workout clothes when it's cooler in Florida. They will be perfect for that purpose. The fabric is nice, pretty stretchy, very comfortable. Would I wear these out to dinner, etc? Probably not...they are definitely made more for athletics than dressing up (for me, at least). These are not a short crop, they come a little lower than the belly button on me. I'm 5'5\" and weigh 128-130, 36 B/C. I got a medium and I have plenty of room but they aren't too big. I buy DonaJo clothes and they came out with a crop shirt, but even on sale it's $40. I got five for the same money! I haven't washed them yet...will update if they don't wash well.",
