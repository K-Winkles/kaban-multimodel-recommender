Not only are they affordable, but they are comfortable and stretchy.

This short is a 5\" inseam and is a bit more compressive than their other lines. I'd liken it to the Dream collection. So fyi, you may feel better by sizing up if you don't like them squeezing on your thighs/legs. I really hope Aurola will shorten thr inseam and give us a 3.5 or 4\" inseam option as I feel these are very long! Yes, you can always roll them up, but that doesn't necessarily give a great look in the back of the legs.",
