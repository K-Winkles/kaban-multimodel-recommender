My waist is about 26in., my hips are 40 1/2in., and my inseam is about 26in. What I love about them is there\u2019s no extra fabric bunching up at the ankle and they have a great stretch to them. Also they\u2019re super soft, comfortable, and thick. The waist band is great quality too it doesn\u2019t roll down and has good tummy control. The color is very good the only thing about the color is the white pair is actually a light cream color which I don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s still a very beautiful color. They\u2019re very flattering and do hug your curves perfectly but not so much it\u2019s distasteful. I got these for everyday wear because my style is comfy and layered with lots of appropriate accessories. So I\u2019ll definitely be using these for cute fall/winter outfits and honestly they\u2019re a great quality basic to have in your closet!",

They don\u2019t really hide the tummy but they do compress you in. So although, my tummy doesn\u2019t flatten, these do give you more shape. As far as how stretchy they are, they stretch well and are NOT see through!!! My only complaints are:No pocketsThe waist rides down as you walk/exercise/sit. It\u2019s just constantly falling.4/5 Postpartum bod seems to like the tight feeling, especially after a c-section.",
