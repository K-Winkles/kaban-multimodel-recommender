I\u2019m 5\u20195 and 130 lbs and ordered a medium at first, they fit but were a little too snug for my liking in the waist area so I returned and got a large! I will probably order a couple more pairs because they are such good quality and so cute! Definitely recommend sizing up, I\u2019m usually a small in spandex but ended up with the large in these.",

The cheek park of the shorts is not constricting at all so it\u2019s not going to squeeze them smaller but the waist is tight but not suffocating so it makes you look super good. I like that these are longer so if you have a lot of cheek then it\u2019s not going to expose your lower cheeks. Really nice and thick too just all around I love.",

                "reviewText": "1st off, these shorts are super cute and flattering in the butt area. I got quite a few compliments and shared this link with them to buy.Pros: these tight compression shorts with ruching on the butt are a great choice for anyone looking for a flattering and supportive pair of shorts for cycling, gym, yoga, and even brunch (bc why not?). The tight compression provides excellent support for your muscles, helping to reduce fatigue and soreness during hard workouts. The ruching on the butt is also a great feature, providing a flattering and feminine look that add fun and flare to your basic workout shorts. The compression in these puppies is REAL. I feel that these are made from breathable material, and do help to prevent sweat buildup and chafing.Cons: These compression shorts are NOT the best choice for folks who prefer a looser and more relaxed fit. The tight compression may be uncomfortable for some, especially those who are not used to wearing compression garments. The ruching on the butt may also be a matter of personal preference, and some may not like the way it looks or feels. The biggest issue for me is that these tend to roll up in the legs easily or roll down at the top if you have a little extra fluff in your midsection. I didn\u2019t love them for my yoga practice, but enjoyed them for hiking and kayaking.",

Absolutely LOVE the fit, comfort, design, feel and even super fast shipping! I usually spend WAY TOO much on my gym attire and wanted to try something out that wasn\u2019t so much and BOOM picked the right product for sure. Feels just like all my other attire for WAY LESS!! Thankful I gave this product a chance and you won\u2019t regret buying either. For reference I\u2019m 5\u20196, 134lbs and bought a small in both tops and bottoms.",
