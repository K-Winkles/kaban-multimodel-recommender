The fabric itself is a little see-through on my chest area (stretched a little more there due to large chest), but otherwise a perfect fit for me to not feel self conscious during barre or yoga in bending positions. They even sent a nice note a nd a matching hair tie. Hopefully it holds up to the heat. I plan to definitely order more in other colors.",

All the others are fine as I ordered small and they all fit, except for the light green. For that one, you'd need to order a SIZE UP. I'd return it, but it still fits (not as loose as the others) and it took 3 weeks to get here so it's not worth it*Disclaimer* Listen to the reviews and order a size down. These tops run big. A small fit my frame just fine where I'd normally be a medium. Also, if you don't already own one, but a racerback type bra, be it a sports bra or regular. These tops look best in them.I'm 4'9 and have a hard time finding tops, let alone tank tops, thaf are not only flattering but also fit me properly. A lot of tank tops are either way too long and or too thin. It's hard to find the in between sizes when you already have a short torso. Plus, covid means good luck finding a store that will allow you access to a change room. I had never bought clothes online and during any other time wouldn't. This top exceeded my expectations! It's light, stretcht and best of all, looks good when I wear it and isn't too long! I ordered a size down as suggested and it's a perfect fit! It's loose which is great if you don't have the athletic body type of frame. I will DEFINITELY be ordering more in the future!",

I love it!It's a 'buttery soft' material that is still breathable. Typically I buy medium to large tank-shirts, just because I like them a bit more loose and not so fitted (don't have that thin mid body where fitted clothes look good on). I decided to take a whim and order a size medium after reading the other reviews (plus the medium came the day after ordering, rather than waiting a few more days for a large). And the medium fits perfectly!!! (as an idea for size wise... i'm 5'1(and a half.. maybe) and weigh about 155-160lbs, my chest size is a c36. The medium is not right on me whatso ever.I'm quite happy with my purchase, that I decided to buy another in grey. : )",
