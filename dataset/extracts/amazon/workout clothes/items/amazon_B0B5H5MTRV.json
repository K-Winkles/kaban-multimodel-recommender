They are completely on trend, the material is thick without being bulky, the sizing is accurate, and they are so soft and warm. I love these and will definitely be buying more.",

My husband actually said I looked like I was wearing a diaper. I got these because I wanted to have something comfy to wear around the house without feeling too frumpy. For me, in this size, they don\u2019t fit the bill. Overall, they\u2019re actually really nice. I love the color, the material is really thick and it has a high quality feel to it. If you\u2019re looking for something really oversized they these might be perfect for you. I will try again with an x-small.",

                "reviewText": "Love, love these sweats. They are thick, soft & warm but you don't cook in them (like the last pair of sherpa sweats I ordered & sent back). I need to clarify...these are NOT sherpa. Just doing a comparison of the warmth. They have an elastic waist and drawstring. I only wish the waste was just a smidgen larger, but if I went a size up they would be too big. The drawstring could be cinched tighter to adjust to for a little larger waist on these. I liked them so much I ordered another pair in a different color and that pair's waist was even a bit tighter. So a little inconsistency going on. I want to say the pants were beautifully packaged, and are high quality. They do NOT feel cheap at all. Nicest sweats I've ever owned! I would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The product itself is not bad. It's super soft inside but please note, the fabric didn't stretch. I'm 5 ft, 115lbs and I carry my weight in my thighs and butt. Normally I wear extra small in pants(if it has stretch!! Otherwise clothes are too big on my waist) so I went with a small. Unfortunately, it was loose in the waist, made a fupa of fabric before it got stuck to my thighs and butt, making it impossible to sit or move comfortably. I'm going to either return them or exchange them for a medium because I do appreciate the thickness and softness of these. I'm putting a three star because maybe it's on me for not going up two sizes. But the small was very baggy on the bottom, so I don't know if a medium will swallow me.",

                "reviewText": "Just WOW. These are fantastic sweatpants. They're cosy!! I like everything about them. I definitely bought these with cold weather in mind--I do not tolerate cold well at all!Details:*Good length (I'm average height, but I have long legs, so that is always a concern for me); probably if you have shorter legs, they'll bunch up a bit, but they're not 'fashion statement' leggings--they're sweatpants;*Warm as toast fleece lining;*Drawstring tie, so you never have to worry that the waistband will get stretched out from wearing and laundering;*Elasticized ankle bands, but NOT tight and constricting. You likely could ease these over hiking boots (again, thinking fall/winter!);*Nicely constructed.I buy mediums in garments like these because of my long legs, but also for winter I might wear regular leggings under these. The drawstring waistband is an essential, too, since I am buying a size up, preventing the pants from creeping down, making me feel like a first-grader with slinking leotards (oh, the horrible memories, lol).Since it's still over a hundred degrees outside, I can't wear them now, and report on how they look after laundering them. I'll likely wash them in cold water, and put on a low setting of dryer for short time, and air dry the rest of the way.Overall, the sweatpants actually exceed my expectations.",
