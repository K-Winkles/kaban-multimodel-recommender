I was hoping it would be somewhat compatible to the DB Method squat machine but no comparison. I should have spent the extra $ for that because shipping eats up the refund amount.",

                "reviewText": "Having had the machine for a few weeks I have a few thoughts about the machine. 1) This has an extreme range of motion. 2) It focuses intently on the front of the thighs and the calves. 3) I am in terrible shape.I found that if you get on the machine by first sitting on the machines seat, you will go through a huge range of motion. From the seated position, this is similar to squatting to the point your hammies area touching your calves. My 65 year old knees object to this much range of motion. My solution: I step on the peddles from the standing position while holding the handle bar. I then lower my self to just above the point my knees object. Then I return to the top position.The first time I used the machine, I only could handle about 1 minute of work. I have broken my exercise into smaller sets and have increased my exercise time with each set.I like this machine, it sets my thighs on fire and I would recommend it to anyone at long as you find a range of motion that works for you and doesn't cause you strain.Worth a look!",
