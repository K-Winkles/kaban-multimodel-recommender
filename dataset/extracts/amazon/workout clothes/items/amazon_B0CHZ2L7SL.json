I bought a medium and large and even though the large was very tight it kept slipping down. The medium fits tight and stays in place, so I would say these are very true to size. Don\u2019t size up. I like the hidden scrunch because honestly the butt crack leggings are so tacky. The only thing I don\u2019t like is that these leggings seem to flatten my butt down a little. So they\u2019re obviously very supportive. I can tell this material will get pulls easily so I wouldn\u2019t use any Velcro around them. It\u2019s not really a high end material but it is very soft and cozy. I could work out in these or take a nap.",

They give you that lifted look, but not over the top - it's very natural. They are a bit thinner than I expected, but they aren't sheer or see-through even in bright lighting. The thinner feel allows you to move around comfortably without the band digging into the stomach. I will 100% be buying another pair.",

The lilac color highlight any sort of cellulite you may have. Got so frustrated with them I threw them away when I should have gotten my money back. I may do that with the black pair I own. The light color also makes any pilling that happens because of the soft material super noticeable. The flare leggings of this same brand are a different texture, silky spandex cool to the touch but they are so much better.",

I also wear size M in gymshark. I have a short torso and these hit me just below the belly button, they could be an inch or two higher. They were compressive in the legs and butt but could be tighter in the waist. Unfortunately they kept sliding down the first time I wore them at the gym, I was constantly pulling them up, but I think a size small would be too tight. They do however make my bum look amazing, and I will probably try another color. I got black and they were squat proof.",
