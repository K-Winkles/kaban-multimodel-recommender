                "reviewText": "Basically, I highly recommend this bra! Great for light to medium impact workouts, casual wear and date nights even! :) It's a good deal for the 3 pack too. Summed up my pros and cons in a bit more detail below.Pros:1. Sizing: The sizing chart was accurate and it fits me better than I expected from some of the reviews. I'm 5'4 130lbs, 34B and a medium fits me well.2. Comfort: This is one of the most comfortable sports bras I've ever had. It's definitely not the most comfortable piece of clothing ever, but on the spectrum of sports bras it's very comfortable.3. Flattering: It's by far THE most flattering sports bra I've ever tried on. The straps don't dig into my back and accentuate my back fat or other fat. It makes my chest look great, and it is very cute with all the straps in the back. My boyfriend loves how it looks on me too!4. Usage: Great to wear by itself while working out, or when you're running around on an errand day. Makes a plain camisole or camisole dress stand out too, if you wear this under. ICons:1. For those with Bigger Bust/Cup Sizes: I would say it's medium support and might not be great for people with a larger chest or bust for this reason.2. Strap Adjustability: The straps are not adjustable, so it doesn't fit you well, you can't do anything about the straps. You can only size up or down.",

                "reviewText": "I've got to share my thoughts on these sports bras because I'm absolutely loving them! I grabbed a pack of three, and I've pretty much been living in them lately. The colors I have are green, black, and white, but let me give you the full scoop.Now, I'll be upfront, the white one is my least favorite. It's a bit see-through, and you can see the bra inserts. If you take those inserts out, it might be a bit revealing with the nipples. But let's set that aside because the comfort level of these bras is off the charts. Seriously, once you put one on, you'll forget you're wearing anything at all.What really stands out for me is the support they offer. I'm a C cup, and these babies do a fantastic job. I can jog, jump, do whatever exercise I want, and my boobs stay in place \u2013 no bouncing around, which is fantastic.Plus, let's talk about the coverage. It's super flattering; I feel great in these. The design on the back is pretty cute too, which is always a bonus.Honestly, I'm sold on these bras. I'm planning to snag them in every available color (well, maybe except white). If you're in the market for comfy, supportive, and stylish sports bras, you've got to give these a try. They've definitely won me over!",

I really like the feel of the fabric and the pad inserts are thick but not overly noticeable, and can be removed if you\u2019d like.The cons: The band is a bit constricting at first, but after a few wears it settles into your shape. If your a bit lumpier, since the band does go down your waist, it will roll if you bend or sit.",

The bra doesn't stay put around the waist when active, as it rolls up when moving. I purchased it for yoga, but it rides up with any movement. It is soft and stretchy. Comfortable fit for around the house. I removed the pads since they felt and looked too bulky. Overall, I'll wear these as pj's but not for the intended purchase of yoga, stretching, or active pickleball.",
