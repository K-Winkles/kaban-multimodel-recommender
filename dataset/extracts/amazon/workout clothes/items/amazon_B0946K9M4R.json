                "reviewText": "I didn't pay close enough attention and bought these thinking that they were regular cotton shirts, but that was my fault so I'm reviewing them for what they are, not what I was expecting. They seem true to size, lightweight, and comfortable to wear. They are extremely thin material, but surprisingly they aren't overly clingy which is good. They would be great for exercising and they're good for around the house; I probably wouldn't personally wear them around town but I'm sure some people would. They keep you noticeably cooler than a cotton shirt would, which I appreciate.",

So when I order more I will try the next smaller size and they should be fine.With that said...everything about these shirts is perfect. They are light but not weak. The fabric is holding up well. Multiple washes and no stretching or shrinking so far. They are so light you really don't even feel them when wearing them. But they are not \"see through\" which I like.",

They are soft and loose, not something you would wear to a dinner or a business meeting, but when you have a day off and you get to be you, these are your shirts. Very thin, super easy to put on after a swim or shower. With the large logo on the back inside of the shirt, it's nice and easy to make sure you are putting it on right. I like them so much, I bought a second set of three. They make an awesome base layer. Dry very quickly and they are highly slop/phobic which is nice for us munchie prone gamers. All of that, and they feel so good. They should pay me for saying this, but these shirts are so nice, I got what I wanted.",
