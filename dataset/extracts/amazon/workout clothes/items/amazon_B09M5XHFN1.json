                "reviewText": "Let me preface this by saying I'm not one for writing reviews, but for these TELALEO Compression Shorts, I'll make an exception. If you're recovering from hernia surgery, listen up - these shorts are game-changers.Pre-Surgery Skeptic:Before my surgery, I was skeptical about compression shorts. They looked...intense. Would they be comfortable? Restrictive? Honestly, I just wanted to be pain-free, not squeezed into sausage casing. But my doctor insisted, so I ordered a pack of TELALEOs on a whim.Post-Surgery Superhero:From the moment I slipped them on, it was like a sigh of relief for my entire core. The gentle compression was supportive but not suffocating, holding everything in place without feeling constricting. Walking, even just around the house, felt easier and less painful.Here's why I'm a die-hard TELALEO fan:Comfort is king: The soft, breathable fabric feels like a second skin. No chafing, no bunching, just pure comfort that lasts all day (and sometimes into the night, I confess).Compression that cares: The targeted support cradles your core without feeling overwhelming. It's like a gentle hug that reduces swelling and keeps everything feeling secure.Mobility matters: I was worried compression would limit my movement, but these shorts actually improve it. They feel like a stable base, allowing me to move with more confidence and less pain.Bonus benefits: The flat seams and tagless design eliminate any potential irritation, and the convenient pockets are perfect for stashing your phone or keys.More than just shorts, these are recovery allies:These TELALEO shorts have become an essential part of my post-surgery journey. They've helped me manage pain, regain confidence, and even get back to some light exercise sooner than I expected. They're not magic, but they're pretty darn close.Final verdict:If you're facing hernia surgery, do yourself a favor and grab a pack of these TELALEO Compression Shorts. They're an investment in your comfort, recovery, and well-being. Trust me, your sore abs will thank you.P.S. I even bought an extra pack for everyday wear. They're that good!",

                "reviewText": "Ordered these because Under Armor is too expensive. These fit really great. Seams are smooth and well sown. Waistband doesn't roll and is a good width. Stretches when working out.However there's one thing I discovered when I went drinking at the bar...there's no piss hole! I thought I had my underwear backwards or something. As the urge to take a beer piss began to grow, and much desperate tugging at the underwear, I realized there wasn't a piss hole! To my relief I realized I wasn't that drunk and was able to finish the mission.I wouldn't recommend this if you're too drunk, or have to wear a duty belt for work, because you might end up pissing yourself. Other than that, it works well!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a pair of Compression briefs and I must say, they have provided me with the ultimate comfort I have been searching for. As someone who leads an active lifestyle, I have tried numerous types of underwear in the past, but none have come close to the level of comfort that these briefs offer.The first thing that caught my attention was the exceptional fit of the Compression briefs. They are designed to perfectly contour to the shape of my body, providing a snug and supportive feel. The elastic waistband ensures that the briefs stay in place without digging into my skin, allowing me to move freely and comfortably throughout the day.",

I recommend going a size larger than your average t-shirt size. I don't like mine to feel like pure spandex. I wear these every day under my collared shirt. Hopefully, this brand/company will be around for a long time! Plan on buying more in the future! Thank you for this great offer!",

I still have the 20-year-old shorts and they are amazingly snug!I re-injured the same hamstring and tried to find a pair that fits as well at a few stores with no luck. These are better than what I found in stores. Still not as snug as I would like but they do the job.I agree with other reviewers - the tag on the back looks like it should be against my skin instead of facing the world - but the white tag sticks out like a flag if I wear it inside-out, so I just keep that shirt tucked in and hope no one will see my tag.",
