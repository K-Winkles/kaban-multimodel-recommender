I love the idea of leggings bc if I want to spontaneously work out I\u2019m already dressed the part (even if I never do, having the option is a plus). I\u2019ve purchased several pairs of leggings since having my baby but they\u2019ve all fallen short in one way or another. These ones did not disappoint though. They are nice and thick so when I\u2019m moving you can\u2019t see through them. The waist is just high enough to give me support but not so high I can tuck my boobs into them. The style is so cute! I\u2019m a bit of a hippy at heart so I was super excited to find these tie dye leggings. I love the pockets! Very good combination of style, quality and functionality. I can throw on a cute top with a cardigan and some boots and feel cute and comfy all day. I suggest buying these if you\u2019re even considering it. I purchased XL and while they\u2019re a little snug it\u2019s perfect for me since I plan on trimming down a bit.",
