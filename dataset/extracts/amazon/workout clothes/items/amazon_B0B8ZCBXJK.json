I'm working on weight loss and I've lost it noticeably in my leg especially my thighs but they fit so nicely I'm wearing them with tunics and t-shirts. I bought them mainly to wear while I ride my recumbent exercise bike and they are WONDERFUL for that too! I am 230lbs and sill have some fat to lose around my tummy and thighs but the XXL fits just right. My husband thought I looked pretty good in them so they are flattering even if you don't have perfect legs, butt and thighs. :) I have washed 2 of the 3 pair and they washed and dried nicely - not too much shrinkage at all. I recently bought another set - in different colors I love them so much!!",

Most of the time clothes like that are pretty cheap, but these are actually pretty nice. The only complaint I have is the chemical smell when you first take them from the bag, but I put them in the wash and it went away. I have been wearing them around the house and even to work with a long tunic. They are thin enough to wear under a skirt and thick enough to wear with a long shirt. I haven't broken out or had as rash so whatever the smell was must have just been from the packaging or something. I just know that I am buying some more because these are super comfy and they are true to size.",

My only disappointment is that they are quite lightweight. They stay in place thanks to the high waistband. My only disappointment is the fabric thickness. I was looking for something to wear through the winter. I will wear them, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll keep me very warm if I need to spend any amount of time outside in the cold Maine chill.Otherwise, these are perfect, and were it not for my expectations of a heavier fabric, I would\u2019ve given them five stars.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these to try them out, selected my size based on the size chart in the pics but didn't have much hope because I have issues getting clothes online. I absolutely loved these when they arrived. They look small but stretch very well and are super soft. I like that these will still fit even when I lose a bit of weight because of the material used and the stretch. There is just a tad bit of transparency (a very tiny bit if you look very closely) in the butt area but I have a large butt for them to stretch over, if you do also I would plan to wear longer shirts to cover your butt or size up 1 size if it's an issue. I bought these to wear under shorter dresses when it's cold and to wear with shirts in the spring. These do not offer tummy control (fine with me) and do not slide down when walking around like tights do. I have several months to drop a few lbs before spring and if I don't get there then I'll come back and get 2 more packs in a larger size (I work in a school so I would need 100% opaqueness in the butt area to wear with a regular shirt come spring). The price is great , less than $30 for a 3pk. After trying on I came back to Amazon right away and bought 2 more packs of the same size.",

First I got the wrong size Amazon suggested 4x but the weight chart suggested 3x so I went with 3 but they are kinda small 4 would have been better. Second I was looking for something similar to popfit leggings I LOVE them they are just $50 a pair but they have a completely different feel they are more spandex feeling where as these are velvety which I don\u2019t like because I have pets and these pick up hair like crazy. I like that these have pockets but I wouldn\u2019t call them deep compared to popfit. But anyway if you want a cheap set these might be for you as long as you want velvety leggings.",
