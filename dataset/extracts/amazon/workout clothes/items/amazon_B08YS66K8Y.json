They are very loose and are easily layered under a jacket or sweater without being bulky. They did not shrink or bleed any color while washing/drying which is defined a bonus in my opinion. My only complaint is that the colors are a little too pastel for my taste but I can\u2019t complain since the price was perfect and the comfort is beyond what I was expecting.",

Nice set of shirts, love the way the neckline scoops, fits comfortably, washes very well.",

The purple one with the text that says \"Love for Sport\" made me and my friends laugh when I wore the shirt on a recent trip, but I love the style of these. The solid shirts that came in the pack were my favorite since they had various cut outs that allowed for some \"breeze\" when wearing them. Very comfy, fit well, and are made of a nice material that's perfect for working out, going for a walk, or lounging around the house.",
