Initially I \u201csized up\u201d to a medium as I don\u2019t like my jackets of this style to be skin tight. However I do like them to be well fitted. Unfortunately the medium was skin tight. Ordered a large (which is 2x my usual size) and it fits exactly like I would expect a S/M to fit. Was hesitant to order a large because it is so atypical for myself but I am so glad I did as it is the perfect \u201cfitted but not skin tight but also not oversized and loose - fit\u201d.The fabric is smooth and stretchy. The diagonal stitching/design on the middle section and bottom hem is ultra flattering - what makes this piece stand out from the rest. The color is completely opaque with a matte fabric finish vs one like a shiny spandex. The thumb holes are comfortable and the zipper is great quality with a nice thick black pull. It doesn\u2019t flop up and down. Small detail but it makes zipping a breeze while adding a nice aesthetic touch. This jacket fits, feels, and looks much more expensive than what it is - great value!",

For me, size 8, it fits perfectly! I'm tall...6 foot...the arm length is long which is hard for me to find clothes that have long arms with a good fit on the body. Both those check off. The only thing I don't like is that the body length is too short. Other than that, this jacket is a quality made item. The fabric stretches nicely and it comes a nice variety of colors.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Better than the Lululemon Define Jacket",
                "reviewText": "I rarely write reviews but after going into a Lululemon store and trying on their Define jacket, I realized how perfect and awesome this Amazon dupe jacket is. The only thing that the dupe falls short on is the fabric. The Lululemon Define jacket has a more cottony, thick fabric that seems more durable. Meanwhile the dupe has a very smooth finish and is very lightweight. The fabric doesn't look or feel as luxurious as the Lululemon one but it's not a major complaint considering the dupe is literally 25% of the price of a Lululemon.This dupe does snatch the waist, not only with its tight material but also the very subtle stitching on the front that has an hourglass pattern. It's my favorite detail, and I rarely see this on other jackets. I'm a person who is prone to major bloating so when I tell you this jacket manages to snatch me in and give me a waist on the worst of days, believe it!The Lululemon jacket has stitching that dug into my armpits and made my upper arms look huge. This jacket has a seam that sits just a quarter inch down your shoulder. It doesn't bunch up in your armpit. The fabric glides over and the stitching just sits so flattering on your upper bicep and it makes your arms look slimmer in my opinion.The front stitching on the chest is way more flattering than the Lululemon. I tried the Define jacket in stores, and the stitching is very weird. It has this inverted u shaped stitching that sits right on top of my cleavage and presses it down. It made me look flat and my cleavage disappeared. I was really at a loss as to why the Define jacket would look like this. Meanwhile, the dupe has stitching that is in the shape of a sweetheart neckline. It sits way above the cleavage, like I would say two inches above, and it doesn't press down. Its just very flattering and the sweetheart neckline shaped stitching enhances your cleavage.Last thing is the Define jacket is a little too long for me to be flattering. I have a short torso and I got a size M and this jacket sits perfectly above my hips. It really is the true BBL jacket. And just like the description says, definitely size up. I fit a 8 in Lululemon which would translate to an M for this jacket.",
