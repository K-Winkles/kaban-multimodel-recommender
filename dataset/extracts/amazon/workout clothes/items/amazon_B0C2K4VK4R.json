The material is thick, and really good quality! I was pleasantly surprised because they didn\u2019t have as many reviews as the other more popular ones, but they did have good ones! They do make your booty look nice and seem to be squat proof! The colors are super cute, I got the blue, pink, and purple set. They fit great, I\u2019m 5\u20197, 140 lbs and I got a size medium. They are tighter but that\u2019s what I wanted for gym shorts. I like how the waist band fits as well, some shorts I have gotten are way too loose around the waist but too tight on the thighs. They are stretchy, cute, and comfy; I get excited to wear them. Definitely going to order more at some point! The only worry I have is that the scrunch on the butt feels like it could rip, but that has yet to happen after doing some exercises. Super happy with these shorts, highly recommend!",

The material is very comfortable and they give a good stretch. I wear them to the gym and around in my every day life. They are high waisted so it slims you down while making your butt look amazing!

                "reviewText": "I bought another pack so I\u2019d have more to cycle through my weekly routine- I had 2 pairs before and I was worried that I would wear through them (they aren\u2019t even close to that though, just some suuuuuper slight pilling on the sides and I\u2019ve had them for months). The fabric feels like quality thickness and doesn\u2019t feel like something you\u2019d get at shien and they\u2019re 100% squat proof. They don\u2019t cut off the circulation at my thighs and the waist shaping helps remind me to engage my core when I work out. I love the color variety so when I need more I\u2019ll definitely check out the more fun colors, I went basic this time but even still the colors I got will go with everything else in my gym fits :)",

They are so cute and accurately sized the only reason I gave it four is because with me having thick thighs these do roll a little when squatting and running which causes me to adjust a little during my workout session which can be extremely annoying for others but tolerable for me",
