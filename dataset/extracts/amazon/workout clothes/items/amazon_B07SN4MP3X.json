I am really pleasantly surprised! This top Is adorable and fits so well and is so comfortable! It's made of a soft and light material, the cup pads are a great thickness and size, the coverage is great for yoga. The strappy back is super unique looking and cute. That said, I'd call this light support so I don't plan to do anything high impact in it. Overall amazing top and I plan to purchase in more colors!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased 3 of these tanks on March 30, 2021. We live in Tahoe, so the days are just becoming sufficiently warm for wearing a tank top. Every time I tried to wear them, twice, I got severe neck & shoulder pains and overwhelming headaches. I was able to return one. This seller claims I am 10 days out of return window. It is now May 12, 2021. The straps cause severe pain in my neck and shoulders. I would like to return the 3 that I have purchased. I cannot wear any of these items and I have only worn each of them on one occasion. I have not worn the white one at all because the headaches caused by the blue and fire coral one were so severe.",

I am 5'5'' and size medium is longer then I would have wanted in the front, arriving well below my hips. This length is not the most flattering given my pear shape but I can do with it. I initially ordered in white and have returned it because it is completely see through and clearly shows the bra pads.",
