                "reviewText": "Product (5/5): The material used is of excellent quality, providing a soft and lightweight feel against the skin. They are breathable and perfect for hot summer days or intense workouts. I also appreciate the attention to detail with the stitching, which adds to the durability and overall aesthetic appeal of the shorts. The elastic waistband ensures a secure and comfortable fit without feeling restrictive.Packaging (1/5): I was taken aback by the disappointing presentation. The shorts were simply folded and stuffed into a plastic bag, lacking any form of attractive packaging or attention to detail. As someone who appreciates a delightful unboxing experience, this was a bit of a letdown",

                "reviewText": "Alright ya'll...I have ordered probably 15 different brands of bike shorts from amazon and here is the winner. 5 inches is the perfect inseam length \u2014 I have muscular legs but carry a little extra fat on my inner thighs and these don't squeeze or cut off at an unflattering length (sorry 6 inch shorts, you're too long...4 inch shorts can look cute if standing still, but up they go once any movement takes place). NOTE - I normally am a M-L (amazon auto size recommended L) but followed the size guide and ordered and XL. Probably could have done a L, too, but happy with my choice.I didn't really believe it was possible for bike shorts to stay in place while working out if your thighs touch and your shorts aren't like, 7 inches long BUT I'm here to tell you I was wrong. These stay. The material is nice (some others I ordered were a liiitttle more luxe feelings, but they ride up and these don't). The fabric is not too compressive, not too loose. I would say they are on the less compressive side of bike shorts, but definitely suck you in more than soft loungey bike shorts.The material is a tiiiiny bit see through if you stretch it and hold it to the light, but you have to really try. I ordered a little bigger and I wear a loose shirt with them so I'm not too concerned. If I was wearing a crop top and doing lots of squats, I might check more carefully.Finally, I passed these by initially due to the butt scrunch, which I didn't want. It's not a big deal/super noticeable...especially with a loose shirt. The rest of the features make it acceptable. No cameltoe thanks to the lack of front seam, and no uni-butt due to the presence of a back seam (hard to find a brand that gets this right).Get yours now!",

They\u2019re great for every day wear and going under dresses just don\u2019t make plans to wear these \u201cbiker\u201d shorts biking. If they weren\u2019t advertised as athletic/biking I would probably be giving it a 5 star review because I really do love them and I wear them all the time. I\u2019m a thick girl so I was hesitant about the biker short trend, I thought they would pinch my thighs like a tube of sausage. These are a good length and not very compressional so they don\u2019t cut off my thighs but they also don\u2019t hold on to my legs while running or biking which was the original reason I got them.",

                "reviewText": "Okay so ordering things on Amazon I am obviously super skeptical, and ngl when I pulled these out of the bag I was like wtf is this material because it was so different to what I\u2019m used to, but I actually love these.The material is stretchy and comfortable. It\u2019s pretty thin and not super compressive, but honestly I\u2019m not concerned about that because some compressive materials actually bring out my lower stomach more since I have a short torso and the compression falls on my ribs. The seam on the butt is very flattering on the glutes and doesn\u2019t look like a butt scrunch at all. It could be more obvious in lighter colours, but in the black it gives you a very natural lift. Since I ordered a small, I was also worried about the leg seams pressing on my thighs and making them look like little sausages, but that is also surprisingly not an issue which I can\u2019t say about a lot of shorts. Overall, the waist fits perfect, my butt looks great, and the bottom leg seam doesn\u2019t dig into my thighs. They also seem to be squat proof.For reference: (usually a small in leggings and a small to medium in shorts)- waist: 28\u201d- stomach: 33.5\u201d- hips: 39\u201d- thighs: 23.5\u201d",

Material is decent to wear and comparable to UA\u2019s quick drying fabrics.Colour wise, it was true to photos. Size, I got a S. This fits me quite well. My waist is 25.5inches while my hips are 35\u201d. 165cm and 51kg if you need those stats as well to gauge what size to get. The fabric has stretch to it.Personally, I wouldn\u2019t recommend to get this because it\u2019s not flattering for me. Will work better for someone with a bigger booty and a very flat stomach.",
