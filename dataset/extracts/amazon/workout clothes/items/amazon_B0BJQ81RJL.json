                "reviewText": "The FULLSOFT High Waisted Biker Shorts for Women are a comfortable and versatile choice for lounging, fitness, and various athletic activities. With their high waist design and tummy control feature, these shorts provide a flattering fit and help to accentuate the waistline. The soft and stretchy fabric allows for easy movement during workouts or yoga sessions, making them a suitable option for active individuals. However, one aspect to note is that I have experienced the shorts riding up during wear. This can be a minor inconvenience, especially during high-intensity activities where constant adjustments may be required. It's important to consider personal preferences and body types when choosing the right size and fit to minimize any potential riding up issues. Despite this, the overall comfort and functionality of the Biker Shorts have earned them a well-deserved 5-star rating for their versatility and tummy control feature.",

She bought this for sleeping, not workout, but the description noted some tummy control which would have been nice. She said they are very comfortable, not baggy, but waaaay too stretchy and NO compression at all. They are long, mid-thigh but reach well above her waist, almost under her bust. The size was Small/Medium, but they would also fit a larger person. She is 5'6\", 145lbs and they are plenty big. Super comfy if you are looking for something to lounge in, or sleep in as they don't ride up and I have to say as her Husband, I like the feel",
