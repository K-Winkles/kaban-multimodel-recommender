I wear them for walking. I walk several miles each trip, and the shorts are comfortable and a great length. The pockets are large. The waistband stays in place and does not cut into your skin. The shorts look good after washing and drying, too. I ordered more of them to wear every day.",

Amazon recommended I buy a size extra large, but when I looked at the size chart, I am a size large., I am 5'7\" and 148 pounds, the size large fit perfectly even after washing, no shrinkage, I am 61 yrs old and have size 43\" hips, they look great on me. I love the length and pockets, and they are deep enough for a phone or an Ipod, etc. I just bought a 5th pair. I can wear them for jogging or just out and about. You can't see through them, even after sweating during a run.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a pair of these last summer and loved them! They were comfortable, great for the hear and humidity, and I never had to worry about chaffing. I took advantage of the Prime day sale on my sister's account to grab another pair and found that they were different than my old pair. According to the tags, they have less spandex in the outer body of the shorts than the pair I got last year. I also think they changed the cut so it's less wide over all. I'm guessing that's why they feel more rough are more tight on your body (btw, the price of the shorts, ignoring the Prime sale, has NOT gone down in the past year). I personally dislike the combination of both changes which result in a less comfortable short that shows every single line underneath (underwear, the built in under layer, everything) so I will be returning the new shorts and looking for a new source of athletic shorts.",
