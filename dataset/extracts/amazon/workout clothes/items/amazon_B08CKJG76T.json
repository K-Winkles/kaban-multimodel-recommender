It's not super tight nor is it super loose.Functionality: I play competitive volleyball. I was able to move, run, and dive in this top. There were no restriction or worry that it would slip off.Comfortability: My only complaint would be that I wish the inserted bra was a little longer. But that's just personal preference since my favorite sport bras that I've become accustomed to are longer. The inserted bra in this top is roughly the size of a standard bandeau. Raising my arms doesn't typically lead to feeling like my \"underboob\" is not contained but, it may for people with a larger chest.Appearance: It's cute! It's a solid basic necessity that doesn't have too low of a neck line. Bright-ish white and again, not see through!",

                "reviewText": "Detailed review ahead (girl, be ready for a novel)\u2026.I have to say first that I am a die hard lululemon fan, but I work as a choreographer every summer for a well respected theatre camp. Last year, all my lululemon running shorts and most of my tanks were on their last leg. I had heard about these online and wanted to give them a try as an alternative for summer camp, as I could spend less and buy more colors to mix and match. WOW! For the money you can\u2019t go wrong.I purchased the white, black, denim blue, and jade green tanks and the matching mesh lined high waist running shorts. I am 5\u20197 and your typical smedium 32dd. I ordered medium across the board. I rapidly lose weight over the summer due to the heat and the exercise. I feel these will fit me if I fluctuate as low as about 15 pounds lighter.Tanks- These are fantastic. They are not for super high impact, but for lower/ medium impact dance they are great. I can also see myself wearing these all summer as loungewear or with shorts. If I sized down it would\u2019ve given me more cleavage than I wanted. I may try taking in the liner a bit for more security near the end of summer when I\u2019ve dropped weight. Great lululemon dupe. Comfortable and flattering. The ONLY con I have is that the size varied slightly by color. The black and white fit more snug (which I preferred). The denim blue and Jade green fit a little looser as you can see in the side profile picture of the denim blue set.Shorts- these are great dupes as well! The back pocket completely fits my iPhone XR. The side pocket is super secure and deep. The shorts are slightly longer in the back. The high waist is pretty small and includes about an inch of tighter elastic. I personally like this for camp so my walkie doesn\u2019t pull them down, but if you have more of a square figure it may pay to size up. The tank meets right where these shorts start. My only complaint on these is sometimes the way they lay can look a bit funky in the crotch area, but nothing too major. The colors all looked great. I wore the white with red underwear and it didn\u2019t show through where the mesh liner was.As a set- Black is perfect and what you\u2019d expect. The white is a CRISP white. Like, it made me pull out my teeth whitener white. It\u2019s beautiful, but literally my Snow White OPI nail polish even looked a tad dingy in comparison. The Jade green shorts were a slightly different shade than the tank. It was not enough for my husband to notice without telling him. For some reason it looks a lot different in the photo but they\u2019re more similar in person. The blue is a pretty darn close match. If anything, the band is slightly different due to the different material. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker for me, as I plan to mix and match a lotFinal thoughts- I love them. I sent both my sisters the links to them, I will live in them all summer, and I will be buying more sets in a variety of colors. Lululemon who?",

                "reviewText": "I had found some other tanks I loved but couldn't really wear them out of the house as an plus size/XL due to the lack of padding and wanted something I didn't have to change out of if I needed to run an errand or walk the dogs. As a B-C cup (depending on the bra) and and XL tshirt size, these are amazing and I've now ordered another color in the XL size of the tank. I feel like they're fitted enough to smooth and give me plenty of lift and support which I was skeptical of since I'm not a \"perky\" lady if ya catch my drift. I also love the thickness of the straps and the feel of the material. I wear them as shirts in various settings and feel plenty comfortable to do so but would not wear them to a \"jumpy/bouncy\" workout class- they're not THAT supportive. I will also say that they're not modest and do end up showing a decent amount of cleavage so if that's not your jam, you may end up returning.",

And it\u2019s so comfortable - it isn\u2019t super tight and still provides the support and cleavage. It fits like it\u2019s tailored to me. I use it as a sports bra, or as a tank under flannels, cardigans, button downs, etc. So comfortable I even love to sleep in it! Perfect for hiking as well - errands - anything. I have one in white and 1 black and they are part of my daily basics. A go to. I plan to order more colors! I can\u2019t think of a complaint, if there was one I would share it with you. I\u2019d say it\u2019s true to size, I was afraid it would be too small and it was not.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a cute new workout top to help encourage me to work out more in 2024. I loved this color and decided to give this a try. I'm bra size 34c and originally got a M but exchanged for a L since it was tight. I like how the large fits way better! It provides a bit of cleavage but not too revealing. I wore this for a zumba class and felt supported with some minor jumping. Not sure if this would be the best for larger busts for very heavy cardio.Looking forward to wearing this as a lounge top as well and trying for other workouts!",

This makes your chest look absurdly good. I'm a small C and this top makes me look like I could work at hooters, honestly wild.Worn it for both low impact and high impact workouts without an issue. It is quite compressive so if you're under a C/D, you should be fine with just the built-in support. Important to note that it fits quite small. I am generally a 32C, wear an XS/S or 4 in lulu, I bought the small and its bordering on too small. It still fits and isn't uncomfortable, but I could probably wear a medium easily. So if you're in between sizes, definitely size up.",
