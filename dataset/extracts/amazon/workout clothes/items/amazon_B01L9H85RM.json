                "reviewText": "First off, these are great breathable lightweight pants. They are stretchy and they are not a skinny pants tight fit, little more on the loose side, which I prefer. The bottom of the pants by the ankles are open and does not have an elastic cuff. That being said, if you are on the shorter side but bigger in build(like myself), these pants will be way too long to wear without it completely just dragging on the ground and looking ridiculous. In order for someone with a shorter but big build to wear these, the pants would most likely need to be hemmed. Others then that, the sizing as far as waist/hips is on point. The length could be shorter for my preferences but for people that aren\u2019t exactly short, the length might be perfect.",
