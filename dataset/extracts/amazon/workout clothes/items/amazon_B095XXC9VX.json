This sports bra is not only stylish but also incredibly comfortable and supportive.The cross back design adds a trendy and unique touch to my workout outfits.

The moisture-wicking properties are a game-changer, as it helps me stay comfortable even during the most intense sweat sessions.The fit of this sports bra is fantastic. The cups offer just the right amount of coverage and support, while the elastic band provides a comfortable and secure fit. I appreciate how it hugs my body without feeling restrictive, allowing me to focus on my workout without any distractions.I have tried many sports bras in the past, but this one stands out for its comfort, support, and style. It has quickly become my go-to choice for my workout sessions. Whether I'm running, lifting weights, or doing yoga, this sports bra keeps everything in place and allows me to move freely.Overall, I highly recommend the Cross Back Workout Sports Bra to anyone in need of a reliable and stylish sports bra.

I saw low impact because it\u2019s not extremely secure on the chest.It\u2019s fitted and has support, but I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable going for a run in this.All and all, I love it!

                "reviewText": "I ended up returning this top, although it looks cute and fabric is nice to touch.I am typically S in tops (bust 34\"/88cm), and this top was quite tight, creating skin rolls on the back due to its creative shape. Other simpler tops (e.g. racer) don't make my skin bulge on the back, which is by no means fat (128 lb at 5'9\"). But this design on the back that I initially liked compresses back under the straps, pushing skin out in between.But the deal breaker was the placement of the bottoms of the criss-crossed straps: the spots where they connect to the upper band across the body, sit right under the shoulder blades and press on their bottoms. Any shoulder or arm movements result in a strong uncomfortable feeling of the straps pushing into shoulder blades. I've never encountered such pressure points with any sport bra or top, and it was the reason for returning this top.",

Always on my page when I turn my computer on despite that was not happy with the product. Not as good as the ones I bought for half the price.",

I\u2019m petite but busty. 35.5\u201d at the bust and 30.5\u201d underbust. M was good and gave me sufficient support while I was running.",
