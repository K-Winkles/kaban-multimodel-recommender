                "reviewText": "These had a good rating so thought I would try them. I am a size 18W normal clothes, so ordered a 1x. The fit was perfect. I do not understand why others are saying they do not run true to size, as they do. The capris were the nice matte stretchy cotton, not the shiny type I hate. The material was a little thin for my liking, but did not seem see thru. I did not like the waist band. It looked like someone stitched the top down and then inserted an elastic band. It was very flimsy and had NO compression on the belly so was not happy. When I bend over, the top kind of rolls down. I was going to return them, but decided to keep them to use for hanging around the house pants. They really are nice looking and the price was only $13, so the comfort made me keep them. Not good for working out though if you need the compression waist band to hold the gut it. I would not buy these again, but gave them a 4 star rating because they are cheap, cute and comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: fit true to size, above average stretch, affordable, seem durable for price point, truly high waistedCons: not true athletic material, lack pockets, see through with slight bendingFit: I am 5'5\" and have short legs with a muscular and proportional build, I typically wear 2X or 3X for bottoms. I purchased a 3X and was happy with that due to fabric issues and waist heightAs a fat person it is extremely difficult to find active wear (or clothes in general) off the rack so it's hard to beat free two day shipping when you have a short time frame. These are cheap leggings and I purchased them because they fit in my budget at the time. They are not really what I would considered athletic wear material but the material does seem a lot more durable/thicker than fashion leggings. They are also sewn as I would expect athletic wear to be- reinforced stitches that look like crap but hold up better to repetitive motion and hard wear. They fit true to size, I'm between a 2X and 3X and ordered the 3X and found I probably could have sized down. They are also truly high waisted, though I am worried about slipping while hiking. The fabric is actually not that tightly woven meaning that a slight bend allowed my partner to clearly see the Deadpool design on my underwear. Not a issue for my purposes but definitely a issue for others. I would not size down if I were to purchase again since they would likely be see through without bending. I also thought they had side pockets which is entirely my mistake, but that affects function. Based on how they are sewn I think they are meant to mimic the look of side pockets which I find slightly misleading but, again, I should have looked more closely and with my budget probably would have purchased anyway.",

They wash up really nice. I would say definitely wash them with your dark clothes because they seem to be a magnet for lint. I also think in the description it is written that there is a drawstring or something? There is not. Not a big deal to me. Also adding a side pocket for your phone or your keys would have been a great benefit, but once again no biggy.The colors are great I purchased the one with the black, white and gray (in a 2x) and I get so many comments on them.",
