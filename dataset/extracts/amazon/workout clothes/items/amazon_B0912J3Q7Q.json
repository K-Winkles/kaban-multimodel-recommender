I previously bought some Amazon activewear(Not this brand tho) and it was horrible. Buy anyways, I digress. This brand is phenomenal!! Both their leggings and shorts. The material feels super soft, not itchy, just the right amount of compression and the pockets are great. The true great thing about this brand though is THEY DON'T ROLL DOWN! As people with non flat tummies know, it's hard to find Activewear that truly doesn't roll down when squatting, running, etc. This is the only brand that I own that finally doesn't roll. The shorts are the perfect length and they're not see-through. 100/10 recommend this brand!!!",

                "reviewText": "I needed comfortable shorts for wearing after having my 5th child. It was a c-section delivery, so high-waistline is a must have feature to avoid irritating the scar as it heals. These definitely felt like they were just right, as they felt tight and kept things from \u201cjiggling\u201d in the initial stages of postpartum, and yet they also weren\u2019t TOO tight so that they felt uncomfortable to wear all day long. The material was pretty good, but just ok, and will show some lines if you don\u2019t use a seamless pair of underwear. But definitely not the thinnest material on the market for workout shorts. Love these for the tummy control, the fit, the pockets, and the high waist. Love the length & colors as well. I bought a medium in black and lavender. They\u2019re a tiny bit right now, which means they\u2019ll fit perfect once I\u2019m not newly postpartum anymore. These pictures were taken just shy of 2 weeks after delivery.",
