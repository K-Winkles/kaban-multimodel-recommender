This jumper can be basic for yoga class or dressed up for a stylish outing on the town. The fit is snug and toning but easy to put on. The hems are sewn nicely and the front zipper looks to be sturdy and of good quality. The sleeves are long intentionally and have thumb holes. At first we were afraid the jumper might be somewhat sheer but that is not the case. The ribbed fabric gives it a nice texture to add to the style. Fabric care is machine washable with delicates and recommend a low heat tumble dry or hang dry after a normal spin cycle. The jumper shown in the photos is a size small.Model 5'3\" / 115 lbs / 32DDD",

However, there\u2019s something a little fishy about this all\u2026there\u2019s no QQQ logo on the sleeve (which honestly, I\u2019m happy about), but it\u2019s also not on the tag, so I\u2019m assuming I was sent a generic version. Also, the zipper on mine is smaller looking than the other pictures, however, again not complaining. I have a smaller chest, so leaving it fully unzipped gives me nice cleavage, but when I tried to zip it halfway up, I moved and it immediately flew down, so beware. Overall, I\u2019m keeping it because it looks great, but it\u2019s definitely not by QQQ and just a really good dupe.",

                "reviewText": "my measurements are 39-33-43 and 5\u20193.The good- love love love the fabric of this jumpsuit. It was super thick and very secure. I purchased this suit as the base piece for a black widow costume and it slapped.THE ISSUE WAS - while I was at the Halloween party in the bathroom, the zipper broke. The horror of being locked in the bathroom with the girls unconfined while trying to get a hold of somebody to help and praying no stranger needed to pee was unbearable. Thankfully my husband answered his phone 10 minutes later and was able to find pliers(at a strangers house no less)to rip the top part of the zipper off and refeed it(one time use fix, do not count on this).I will, like another reviewer said, be replacing the zipper because I looove this suit. It looks amazing with sneakers and a long line puffer for everyday wear. The quality of the actual jumpsuit is amazing but the zipper needs HELP. Please replace your zipper before even trying to wear this out, especially if you have a bladder.",

If you have big girls in the front like me, the zipper does come down. I made it work tho. Very comfortable and stretchy. (It\u2019s not see through). I\u2019d recommend this product \ud83d\ude0a",
