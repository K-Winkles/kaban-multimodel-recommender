The fabric washed and dries very well. I did hang to dry as I really liked the fit and did not want it to shrink. I ordered a small and I like the way it fits. It is a little baggy as designed, but very true to size. Long sleeves! It seems like the type of fabric that won't pill. I like that the length is a little shorter and the 1/4 zip is nice for taking it on and off easily.",

It has a short zipper in the front that gives a little extra room to pull it on and take it of, sort of a collar with the hoodie for wind block, and a large pocket that goes all the way across so your hands can meet in the middle. The fleece material is warm, very soft, a little bit stretchy, and pretty much the same as any comfy hoodie. The design is very sleek looking. I have this in the light gray color which is a very soft gray. It did not bleed colors, shrink, or wrinkle after washing.",

                "reviewText": "One of my favorite things about a comfortable hoodie is the inclusion of longer sleeves with thumb holes but unfortunately this hoodie failed on both aspects. While the sleeves on this hoodie might be an acceptable length (I would still prefer them longer though) the thumb holes were definitely too small and not placed in the right spot which made them uncomfortable to use. Besides the unfortunate thumb hole situation the fabric itself is not very soft and the hoodie has an odd cut in the back. The zipper also seems very cheap and is rough to the touch. While I do like the color (I got the pink one) and the large size of the hood the other aspects make this a definite no for me.",

I have quite a few sweatshirts in this general style and this is not my favorite of them. The sleeves are on the shorter side for me (I'm 5'10\") and the thumb holes are tight on my thumbs. Overall it's fine, but it won't be the one I reach for first.",
