I\u2019m tall and found the medium to be a cuter and better fit than the small. They were the same cropped length, just wider And bigger on the body and sleeves.The small could have worked but the sleeves were a good 1 inch shorter than the medium. I have very long arms. The medium does not look too boxy and has a cute slightly oversized look. I went back and ordered 3 more colors for the great price point! Looks much cuter than sweatshirts I ordered from online retail stores that price for 3-4x more.",

It\u2019s very well-made. Nice stitch super soft on the inside fleece, super comfortable.

I got it in the shade of purple or more of a lilac (light purple) and it\u2019s cropped perfectly for high waisted clothing. The fabric is soooo soft and warmer than I expected it to be, but it\u2019s perfect for chilly Canadian summer evenings around the fire. Delivery was fast and I\u2019m already debating a second purchase \ud83e\udd14 \u2026 Only very minor downfall was it be wrinkled when shipped.",

The seams are literally stitched on the OUTSIDE of the sweater, i don\u2019t understand what the thought process was when making these\u2026 it actually looks like i'm wearing it inside out. You can see around the neck that it was sewn properly with the stitching on the inside, but everywhere else where a seam is- is the wrong way?? And the fit is super boxy. So unhappy.",
