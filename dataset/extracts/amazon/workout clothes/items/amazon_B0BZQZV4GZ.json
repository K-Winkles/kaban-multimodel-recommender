The 3.0s are different in design from my previous order, there are some improvements for hot weather wear. The weave is thin, keeps its shape, has a good hold, stays cool. They\u2019re incredibly soft and comfortable. The tops rest mid-ankle bone. I like the colors to keep things fun yet they stay hidden. The difference between the Superlite No Shows and the Superlite Super No Shows is about an extra 1.5\u201d reveal around the top of my foot.",

                "reviewText": "When I first got these socks I was a bit concerned that they are thin and probably won\u2019t keep me warm but I was mistaken. They definitely keep my feet warm thru the day, yet they are thin and very comfortable. They are pretty much perfect for all of my closed toe shoes and not really noticeable even if I would wear a dress with sneakers. They are great quality and can barely feel them on, as far as socks go this is fantastic choice!",
