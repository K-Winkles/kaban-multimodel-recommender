They are well made and actually longer than I needed but I'm 5'3\" so I expect that. They are well made and the pockets will easily hold a cell phone.

They do have a shine and there is a seam in the crotch. All my tops were long so not an issue, but worth noting. I very much liked the outside pockets. One on each side and room for your phone.",

I Have washed once and came out beautiful like they are still brand new. They also have the side pockets for phone etc that I don\u2019t use but nice incase I need a pocket! You won\u2019t be disappointed. I am 5\u20195\u201d\u201d weight about 118. By their sizing chart ordered a small but were a bit tighter for my liking so I returned for med. perfect fit!",
