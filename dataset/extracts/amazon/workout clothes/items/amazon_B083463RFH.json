                "reviewText": "Good Shorts. I\u2019m a 34 Waist and I\u2019ll have to say the Medium was still too short though. It recommended a Medium in the size chart because it says a medium is for anyone with a waist of 35-39 but I saw someone\u2019s review saying they were a 34 and it was good and although the waist is okay the length is like old school basketball shorts, decently high above the knee. Personally I prefer below the knee shorts so I have to order a large one instead. (I\u2019m only 5\u201910 btw).I don\u2019t normally like spandex or anything tight against my skin but surprisingly these shorts do a good job of not limiting movement and breathability. Reminds me of Nikes Dry Fit Material sorta.",
