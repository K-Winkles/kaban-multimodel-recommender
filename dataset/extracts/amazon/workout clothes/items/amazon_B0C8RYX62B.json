I will be buying more for sure but in a medium since I\u2019d like them to be a bit longer incase they end up shrinking a bit in the wash as time goes on. Other than that they\u2019re perfect!!",

The band doesn\u2019t feel too tight. I\u2019m typically a small to medium in clothing and small fits well with these.The legs are unfortunately too long (5\u20192\u201d) for just walking around the house in but easy enough to tuck in or roll them a bit when home. Good price point and works well for what I needed. The dark brown are not see-through from what I can tell when trying them with black underwear.",

Semi thick material but it doesn't pass the squat test if you're a little thicker. It didn't really do much for the fupa area, kinda disappointed in that department. The bottoms go past my ankles so not too short. They definitely look good on though in spite of a few flaws and compliment my figure. Overall it's a decent product for the price and I'd buy more from them. Hopefully the company going viral doesn't make the quality of their products suffer in the long run.",

They are a thick ribbed material so not like a smooth (lululemon) legging and they contour your legs and waist so good. However, BEWARE of the length. If you are 5\"3 or shorter, you will be ok but if you are any taller, they are too short unfortunately. I am 5\"4 and the bottom barely covers my ankle and doesn't touch the top of my foot at all. Sadly, I had to return these. I hope they add a longer length eventually based on the reviews because I will repurchase if they do.",

                "reviewText": "I found these amazing, they are quite thick which makes them very comfortable and also not transparent at all. They are a very good deal, HOWEVER since I'm taller (I'm 5\"11) , they look a little odd at the end as they are not as long as I would want. They stop above my ankle when on the pictures they go down way more. I understand that it's logical since my legs are so long, so I would recommend them, but only if you are smaller. I would say if you're 5\"9 or taller and you want them to touch your shoe, don't take these.",
