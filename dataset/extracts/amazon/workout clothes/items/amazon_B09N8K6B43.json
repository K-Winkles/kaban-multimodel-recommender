                "reviewText": "I've been on the hunt for the ideal pair of gym shorts, and I've finally found them with these women's gym shorts. These shorts have become an essential part of my workout wardrobe, and I can't say enough good things about them.First and foremost, these shorts are incredibly comfortable. The fabric is soft and stretchy, which makes them perfect for all types of workouts, from intense HIIT sessions to yoga and everything in between. They move with me, allowing for a full range of motion without any restrictions.One of the standout features for me is the moisture-wicking technology. I tend to work up a sweat during my workouts, and these shorts do an excellent job of keeping me dry and comfortable. I never have to worry about feeling sticky or uncomfortable, no matter how intense my workout gets.The fit is just right. These shorts are snug enough to stay in place during runs and squats but not so tight that they feel constricting. The waistband is comfortable and doesn't dig in, which is a huge plus. Plus, they come in various lengths and styles, so you can find the perfect fit for your body type and personal preference.I also appreciate the stylish design. These shorts look great both in the gym and for casual wear. The color options are trendy, and the quality is evident. Even after several washes, they still look as good as new.The durability of these shorts is impressive. They have held up well to frequent wear and washing, showing no signs of wear and tear. This longevity is a testament to their quality.In summary, these women's gym shorts are a fantastic addition to any workout wardrobe. They strike the perfect balance between comfort, performance, and style. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for shorts that can keep up with their active lifestyle. These shorts have truly become a game-changer in my fitness routine.",

                "reviewText": "These shorts are absolutely perfect for my preference. They are extremely comfortable, I do not like the feeling of very compressing biker shorts to the point it feels suffocating. They are breathable for me and keeps me dry during the workout. The scrunch is more of a subtle scrunch for me and I am perfectly fine with that because I do not like scrunches that are wrinkly and very noticeable. They also fit my size, did not need to size up or down. They are thick, great quality material. I tried the sticker trick and did a squat proof test and I can confirm it is not see through at all. The colors are absolutely beautifully created. One thing that is a bit of a down side is that it will once in a while ride up on me and I only think it\u2019s because they are a bit long on my legs.. I am on the shorter side I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d. When it rides up it doesn\u2019t bother me because it\u2019s not to a point where I have to pull them down constantly it\u2019s just once every few hours or so. These are definitely worth the price and are affordable. I will be buying other ones in gray and looking into other pieces of gym clothing in their brand. I honestly never looked so good in biker shorts!!",

After waiting a couple months I decided to splurge on Black Friday and buy them. They fit perfectly and suck you in and give you a small waist. They also are super soft and almost feels like your not wearing anything as well as make your butt look amazing and are squat proof. If you have the money 100% buy them. I will be buying more after the holidays.",

However, I did encounter a small drawback that prevents me from giving these shorts a full 5 stars.Let's start with the positives \u2013 the fabric is comfortable, and the stitching is top-notch. The shorts feel durable and are well-suited for various activities. I also appreciate the attention to detail in terms of design; they look great and are versatile enough for both casual outings and more active pursuits.Now, onto the downside \u2013 the length. While I understand that preferences for short lengths can vary, these shorts are just a tad longer than I expected. As someone with slightly larger thighs, they hit at an unflattering location that make my leg bulge out at the bottom.",

                "reviewText": "These are my favorite shorts that I own for leg workouts. They are very flattering, and the quality is top notch. I have a love-hate relationship with \"butt scrunch\" leggings... what I like about them is the practical aspect. This is going to sound weird lol, but its like each butt cheek is separately secured, so when you do squats, it doesn't feel like there is near as much stress being placed on the center-back seam of the material that goes over your butt. This also means that the material itself stretches less, meaning less chance of the material being see-through.I do NOT like butt scrunch leggings for the \"showing off your butt\" idea. I don't want that kind of attention when I go to the gym. This is precisely why I like these shorts as much as I do. They have the most discreet \"butt scrunch\" that I have tried. Enough to be practical and a little flattering, without giving off \"LOOK AT ME\" vibes. I would still only buy them in black, or a very dark color like navy, because the lighter/brighter colors would still have more of a show-off effect than what I am comfortable with.Some people are complaining about the length of the shorts. Yes, I agree that they are definitely longer than the picture makes them look, but I personally way prefer the biker short length. No rolling up or having to adjust anything mid-exercise.",

The material is thick so you don\u2019t have to worry about anything being see through. There\u2019s no front seam which alleviates the concern about unflattering front appearance. The material is soft and smooth. The detail on the back is flattering and comfortable unlike some shorts I\u2019ve tried that have way too much of a scrunch and the way it\u2019s shaped is uncomfortable. Definitely worth the purchase and I\u2019ve bought many.",
