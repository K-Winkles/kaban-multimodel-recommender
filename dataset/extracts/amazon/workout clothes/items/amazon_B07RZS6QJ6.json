                "reviewText": "I have ordered these pants at least 3 times now, in almost every color. I am 5'4 and 205 lbs. I wear a XL. Fits wonderful, but a tad long. Other wise, they are just perfect. Soft, comfortable, stretchy fabric. They are loose enough to be comfortable for all day wear but they are tight enough to keep the mom gut tucked in. Easy to clean and they never wrinkle, even when I leave the laundry in the dryer for days instead of folding it... I can pull a pair of these out and wear them with no one the wiser. They are tagless and have flat seems so nothing to irritate sensitive skin. (Although because of this I have accidentally worn them inside out on more than one occasion!) Nice big pockets on both sides. They fit my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra in its case. And they are durable! I wear these for work... generally keeping 4-5 pair on hand. But they are each getting worn and washed on a weekly basis. They tend to hold up nicely for 1.5-2 years before the repeated washings combined with the chub rub starts affecting the seams. I've also ordered leggings from this brand and they are just as wonderful!",

(Short women don't understand what it's like to always get pants that are high-water above the ankles, when you don't want them to be.)The left and right side pockets are perfect for my phone or my keys. I previously had some pants with a pocket in front of the tummy, but who wants their stomach to look bigger? I also appreciate the little brand icon on the center back of the pants -- it makes it so easy to know which way is correct to put them on. (a little thing, but very handy)I've now ordered several of these in different colors. I'd rather wear them than jeans any day, LOL!",

                "reviewText": "I bought these as lounging/traveling/sports/weekend wear. For reference I'm about 142lbs, and 5'7\" with an athletic build. I was hesitant as I'm not a fan of anything with a high waist, but had trouble finding anything else that met all of my requirements. I was looking for something I could dress up to wear to work, as well as I could wear to coach on the courts/fields as well as lounge around in on the weekends. My musts were 1. Leg pockets for my phone 2. Matte black as I hate shiny athletic clothes 3. Wider legs. So, I've owned them for a couple of weeks now. They've held up well through multiple washings. As far as fit, I bought the large (I'm normally a medium) and they fit perfectly, not tight, but not loose (they did shrink a little and I've gained a few pounds while in quarantine so perhaps that combo made the Large fit) . They hit me right or slightly below the belly button, which is my Least favorite thing (but again, it's really hard to find everything that I wanted in a yoga pant). They are NOT shiny. They are a very smooth and incredibly soft (material) in matte black. They do have pockets, but they aren't the biggest or deepest -- my Samsung Galaxy 8+ (it's the big one), just fits. When I sit, the top of my phone peaks out --so I wish the pockets were bigger and deeper. These yoga pants are also on the thicker side --good for quality as the weight of my phone did NOT pull the pants down or bulge that sometimes happen with thinner materials, but bad if you want to workout in them and not over-heat. I recently wore them on a 10 hour plane trip. And I also had my mom's dog jump repeatedly on me for several days and no snags or rips or other marks on these. They are just a tad long on me but I like that, so when I sit and cross my legs, no one can see the color of my socks. :) Overall, thick good quality - but could stand a few minor tweaks.Update: I now own 3 pairs of these (all Larges - 2 black and 1 dark grey). I wear the 2 blacks ones all the time (literally every weekend). Oddly though, the 2 new pairs fit quite a bit tighter in the waist than the original pair. And the dark grey one seems like it's a full size smaller so they are fairly uncomfortable if I wear them for long periods (missed the return window). So the sizing might be off depending on color and even when you purchase. I'm tempted to get the next size up (XL) now.",

It\u2019s so hard to find decent workout/comfy pants that aren\u2019t completely transparent and \u201ccheap\u201d, but these are definitely the exception! As soon as the pants arrived, I was a bit skeptical of their size. (I read multiple reviews and tried to gauge what size I\u2019d need) They appeared small, but I wasn\u2019t afraid of a challenge. But, there was no challenge at all. These pants fit like a GLOVE and they are the most comfortable, flattering, solid-colored britches I\u2019ve had! No transparency, unless I literally dropped it all the way to the floor LOL. I didn\u2019t even want to take them off at the end of my errands yesterday, they were so soft, stretchy, and comfy! Point is, I highly recommend these and I will definitely be ordering more :))",
