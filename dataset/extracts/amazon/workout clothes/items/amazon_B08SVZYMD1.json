I may have been able to go with the barge, but only if I wanted a really snug fit and extra cleavage lol. I am so shocked and pleased with the quality and fabric of this bra! It's hit or miss sometimes as you girls know, but this is one of those moments where we say oh my god this is actually really cute lol!!!! I thought they were just going to be a plain bra but they have an odd bit of structure to them, thick material and slightly padded... I guess this is how some of the reviews had ladies that look really good wearing this as just a shirt I would do exactly the same once I am rid of my tummy! But for now it is a very comfortable nice. Looking sports bra definitely worth it! I'm also really pleased, but again surprise that the straps do not dig into my skin at all. They are really sexy looking with. I will say it again really great support. I've had it on for a few hours and I still can't tell it's there so if someone is on the fence and wants a very tight fit, they could go down a size but if you want it to be comfortable go with your actual size. Oh, and I do black blue and white\u2026 The classics! I also have never said this before and low-key think it's cheesy but who cares I literally want these and all the colors!\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

They are slightly padded for extra umph, but also is automatically shaped to cover the entire breast.The coverage of the cloth is full, and double lined, leaving I padded bras little to the imagination, because you can\u2019t see nips.The straps were hands to straighten at first, I\u2019m not gunna lie. It was a \u201chey babe, can you help me with my bra straps please?\u201d But then after a few tries, you\u2019ll find a way to straighten them out yourself.Wash in cold, hang dry. This fabric does shrink in low heat. I\u2019m a Large breast, 36DD and sized up to an XL and shrank my bras the first wash. They are slightly tight after wearing them all day long, but we\u2019re the perfect fit had they not shrank. So, if you hang dry always, you\u2019ll have a true to fit size, otherwise - size up twice.",

I have had these for about a year now and they work the same as when I first got them! They also show no signs of any wear or tare which I am incredibly happy about!! I highly recommend these!!!

These were still very very tight, which isn\u2019t a huge deal because I prefer compression. I\u2019m hoping after washing, they are a bit less tight but again, not a huge deal.My biggest complaint is that they roll up- badly. I wore them casually before wearing them to the gym, just to get an idea of how they would feel. I\u2019m so glad I did, I couldn\u2019t imagine adjusting or pulling down the top a million times while exercising. It would be so frustrating. Every time I sit down, it rolls up. I can feel it rolling up while walking.Besides rolling up, they are pretty great. Super cute, the straps don\u2019t get twisted, the cups have great support. I just wish they didn\u2019t roll up \ud83d\ude2d",

They do fit small and I ordered based on my size knowing by the other reviews they would be snug. I run so I like them to fit tighter. If you like a snugger fit order your size if not size up one. I would buy again as they are better than I expected. Can\u2019t beat the price for 5 bras.",

I listened to the other reviews and despite the size chart saying I'm a medium being I'm 5'9\" 140lbs and a 34D, I sized up and went with large and they fit perfect!! Haven't actually tried a workout yet but can tell it won't be enough support for a high-intensity workout, but perfect for the low-intensity workouts and yoga I do. They also seem cute enough to flash under a cute shirt or even wear on it's own in the summer! Love the colours and the price point was great-- all around very pleased!",
