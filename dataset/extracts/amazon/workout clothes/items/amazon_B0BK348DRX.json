                "reviewText": "Finding activewear that can perform well in both yoga and running can be a challenge, but this set definitely meets the mark. The material is soft and stretchy, which allows for a full range of motion during yoga poses and provides support during runs.One of the standout features of this set is its breathability. The fabric is designed to wick moisture away from the skin, which helps to keep you cool and comfortable during a workout. This is particularly important during a high-intensity activity like running, where you want to stay dry and comfortable.Another thing I appreciate about this activewear set is its versatility. It's perfect for both indoor and outdoor workouts, and the stylish design makes it easy to wear outside of the gym as well. The pieces can be mixed and matched with other activewear or worn as a set for a coordinated look.Overall, I would highly recommend this activewear set to anyone who is looking for a comfortable and high-performing outfit for yoga and running. It's durable, stylish, and versatile, making it a great investment for anyone who is serious about their fitness routine.",

I had full range of motion and didn't feel like the sweat clung to me. In fact, when I ran errands after the gym I didn't have that groggy wet feeling that other materials carry post workout.BUT it is so fitted that it is revealing. I am usually a size medium, but maybe this can be resolved by going up a size. I anticipated some boob/booty form fitting but didn't realize that my uh... \ud83d\udc31 would be outlined as well lol. I wrapped a sweatshirt around my waist when not actively in the middle of a workout. But DO be aware of that.It did shrink a bit after washing and drying so consider at least air drying it if you wash it in the washer.",
