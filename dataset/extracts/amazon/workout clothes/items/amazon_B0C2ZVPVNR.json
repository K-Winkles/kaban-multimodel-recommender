The bottom is cuffed with elastic but not overly tight and constrictive like some i've had. Drawstring allows you to adjust slightly to make tighter or give a bit of room. They are just slightly smaller than I hoped but the XXL seems to fit an 18. Not at all uncomfortable. Nice pair of pants",

                "reviewText": "These cargo joggers are awesome! They are exactly as pictured and they fit great. The sizing is spot on, so you can feel secure ordering your regular size. I love the zippered pockets, and they are big enough to fit my samsung s23 ultra with the case on, so these are BIG pockets! There are also additional flap pockets on the sides of the legs, so plenty of room to carry everything. Even with the pockets, these pants look super streamlined, and the fabric is very lightweight and breezy and feels great even in summer heat. They dry off very quickly if you get them wet, so if you get sweaty it is no big deal!Definitely five stars, and if I could rate these higher I would. I\u2019m so in love\u2026these will be getting tons of wear. Highly recommend.",
