                "reviewText": "I'm an older woman who has always hated bras, but absolutely cannot get away with going braless, 'cuz, well, saggy granny boobs doesn't even begin to cover it. If the bra is snug enough to keep the girls from falling out the bottom, my ribs hurt like heck (always have, my entire life, it isn't due to getting old). Long lines are more comfortable, but beastly difficult to find for short-waisted women like me, and even harder to find in a 38-40B, bra makers all seem to think that a larger band size automatically means giant boobs. I can assure them, it does not.)These bras are made of thick, sturdy material that feels like compression hose for my torso. They don't quite reach my waist, but hold Thelma and Louise up where they belong and they don't hurt my ribs at all, in fact, they are the most comfortable bras I've ever owned. I am a women's size 14, regularly a 38-40B, with quite a bit of chub around my side to back ribs, and the large fit exceptionally well, NO BRA LINES!!!I did have to replace the padding with firm molded bra cups, because the squishies just go flat in sports bras, so I need the shaping, but that's me, not the bra, as can be seen in pics posted by others who don't have this problem.I've washed and dried all three, and have not had the problem some others have had with them falling apart. I bought the white, black, and beige trio, I cannot speak for other colors.",

I am tall, and a 34B and typically size up to a large in sports bras for my personal preference of fit and these were great except that I was being pinched under my arms. Sports bras without adjustable straps are a gamble for me, and I was genuinely sad to send these back. I bet they're really great if you're more on the petite side or prefer a shorter strap on your sports bras.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little skeptical because I was looking for the perfect bra top that wasn\u2019t too bra like and too small. All these sports bra tops are either too long in torso for my small frame or tiny and I wanted something comfy and modest to wear with my athletic skorts and shorts. After ordering and retuning 10 tops this one popped up and I was like \u201cwhat\u2019s one more\u201d it\u2019s awesome. Really. I love that the bra is built-in and comfortable and has padding. I love how it\u2019s like the perfect length for me and it\u2019s soft and breathable enough. It\u2019s not a workout top. I\u2019ll be clear on that. It\u2019s definitely more of a day-to-day top! And it absorbed without showing plenty of florida sun, sweat. Haha. Will be buying all the colors.",

                "reviewText": "Firstly, nothing wrong with the tops but, full disclosure, I did send them back.The good: Fabric is great! Nice and thick, holds everything in, feels like it could go the distance.The meh: The pads are kind of small but that could just be a personal preference and if I'm honest, I could put my own in there. The length could be longer... again, could be my preference.The bad: There really isn't anything terrible about these. I just didn't like how they fit. I am a middle-aged woman with mom-bod complicated by an explant, so I have a rough time finding tops that I feel good in.Overall: Maybe younger people with more youthful/perky busts will find these more flattering as can be seen in the reviews with pictures, but these were not for me.",

                "reviewText": "Tight, stretchy, compression material holds everything in. The removable padding left weird marks/lumps on my breasts, so I pulled them out and I like the bra more without the removable padding. I\u2019m petite but have large breasts, and the medium fits nicely. I breastfeed too, and the cutout/low neckline makes it really easy to pull the bra down over your breast to nurse. And the cleavage this top gives you is A+!",
