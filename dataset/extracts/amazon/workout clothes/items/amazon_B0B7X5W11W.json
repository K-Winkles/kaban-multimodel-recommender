Only I have with the brown set is that the biker shorts are not the same color as the tops and leggings, they more of a clay reddish brown. I will be ordering this set in more colors.",

I usually am between a medium and large depending on the brand (I am 5'4, 140lbs, with a 30-31 inch waist), and first I ordered a medium, which was way too tight and made my belly squish out the top of the shorts/pants in a very unflattering way.The return process was extremely quick & easy, I got my refund promptly, and re-ordered a size large this time. The large fits way better and more comfortably, but the very high waist of the pants/shorts kind of makes my stomach squish out between the high waist of the pants and the matching tops. I guess this can only be avoided if you have a flat, toned stomach anyways.I also didn't like the top with the double one-shoulder straps. It just looks weird. Maybe it's just not for me, but I wish I had gotten the other green outfit with the single one-shoulder strap instead. I doubt I will wear that top often.",

However the legs on the leggings are EXTREMELY tight... the waist is not, not on me anyways. Sports bras are fantastic, set is still wearable, just a little difficult to workout in without fear of them falling down.",
