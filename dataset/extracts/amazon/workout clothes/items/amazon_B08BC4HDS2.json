Shirts a very silky and comfortable, seems well made, colors options are very good and my XXL shirts were a perfect fit - even after multiple washes. No excess fabric billowing around my mid-section, neck and arms are perfect. Shirts keep me very cool when working out. 5-stars so far. Only thing that's lacking is the moisture wicking functionality. My sweat keeps the shirt wet for a long time and takes quite a while to dry-out. I have other name-brand dry-fit sportswear that do a much better job of moisture wicking, so I know how it should perform. These just don't.However, the value is great. I love the colors, fitment, cooling factor, and quality. For that I can overlook the lack of moisture wicking.",

                "reviewText": "While these are labeled as workout shirts I think perhaps they are a bit dressy for that, in fact they are quite a bit dressier than my usual pick of all cotton tee shirt, the brand that has tens of thousands of reviews here. These aren\u2019t quite as popular but they should be, they are better made and about the same price per shirt if you buy the multipacks with five shirts in them. And the biggest thing they have going for them is the incredible choice of colors, although I would suggest to them that they should try to stay away from including so many of the dull dark colors, today\u2019s active man doesn\u2019t dress like his grandfather, bright colors are very popular now.The material isn\u2019t like most casual tee shirts, it is a shiny slick manmade material that on close inspection looks like it is knit like a very thin sweater.WHAT I LIKETopping the list of likes are the great bright colors that stay bright wash after wash. They don\u2019t shrink either and they are true to U.S. men\u2019s sizes. That makes them easy to buy. They feel great and don\u2019t show wrinkles.NOT SO POSITIVEThere is nothing that I dislike about these but there are a few things you should know. One is that they are fairly thin. That coupled with the shiny texture makes them reveal everything including the nips. They also look too expensive and dressy to wear casually around the house, like mowing the lawn for example. Like I said, not a negative just something to be aware of. If you live in a hot climate as I do these are absolutely wonderfully cool and lightweight feeling.YES OR NOAfter getting ready to order my usual brand and being disappointed that their shades are so boring I searched and was amazed how many choices there were. I landed on these because of the huge range of colors available. Once I saw the price (especially for the multi-paks) I was hooked. These are one of the best values around.",

At the price point it breaks down to $6 plus per shirt, if you go out and get one from one of the major sporting companies (Nike, Adidas etc...) you'll be paying almost 10x for a similar result. So nothing but good things from me for this product.",
