                "reviewText": "I liked this workout set so much that I bought a second pair.Key points:-I sized up to a medium (5\"2, 120 lbs, typically wear a small)-I have other sets from this brand in a small, and medium is better for me in that it doesn't leave any marks in my skin from hours of wear but still sits comfortably on my waist-The fabric is lightweight but not see through, aka squat proof-My torso is pretty short, so I am able to overlap the shirt and pants fabric when my arms are resting (especially great if you don't like as much of a skin gap as other sets)-The design is flattering. I will say it isn't the intense tummy shaping thick fabric, but still looks great-Definitely solid value for the price",
