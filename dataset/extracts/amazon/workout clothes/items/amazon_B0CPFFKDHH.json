                "reviewText": "These are some of the most comfortable leggings I have ever bought! The gray ones are on the thin side, so they are not squat proof. But the black ones and the other pair are nice and thick and definitely squat proof. These are also very high waisted, which was a huge plus for me. It snatches in my problem area (stomach) so nicely! For reference, I am 5'10\" and weigh over 220lbs. I got a S/M because I wanted that extra snatch in the waist. I wasn't worried about the size because if they didn't fit I would have given them to my daughter. But these fit amazingly! There is compression but not so much that I feel suffocated. I also don't feel like they are going to split or tear anywhere either, including when I'm squatting.",

Here is my take on these Syrinx leggings:PROS:-soft & VERY comfortable (feel like form fitting pajama pants)-does NOT PILL like thicker leggings-roomier in calves than average-decent pockets that fit my Samsung S23 Ultra-sizing as expected, plenty long too (I'm 5'4\")CONS:-NOT heavyweight (\"fleece lined\" is a stretch of semantics)-Ambiguous design (no obvious front or back...tag is on side, no front waist pocket)-NOT very supportive...likely due to lower spandex content = muffin top overflow-Can't order just one color/itemI LOVE these leggings for wearing around the house, but due to thinness and lack of support, I wouldn't be comfortable wearing them outside or for running errands. I much prefer Yezii brand or Chrleisure for super thick leggings, and I always order XL for extra comfort, as most brands run small.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn\u2019t expecting much for the price - literally just something to wear in my own backyard with pockets to hold may phone & dog treats. But, omg. These are my new favorite leggings by far. They are so, so soft. I am something like a leggings connoisseur. I have an entire shelf of them I stopped wearing the cheap, F21 types years ago & pretty much only wear that famous yoga brand, swoosh brand or occasionally, the ones from the famous lingerie store. I do have some of that one brand everyone said felt \u201clike buttah\u201d a few years ago but I wasn\u2019t really impressed with them. These leggings, on the other hand, are ACTUALLY soft \u201clike buttah\u201d. The softest ones I own by a mile\u2026 and they have pockets!Here\u2019s what else you need to know: they didn\u2019t seem to pill or shrink in the washer/dryer, they aren\u2019t see through, the pockets are big & stretchy enough to fully encompass my iPhone with a case and popsocket on it (unlike another pair of pocket leggings I have in which my phone is secure but peaks out of the top) plus lipgloss, AirPods & key fob. Also, the puppy has literally tried to climb my leg while I was wearing them and they didn\u2019t snag or shred. I don\u2019t think they are actually fleece lined as the listing says though. If so, it is a very fine dusting of fleece lol. Nothing like other thicker and/or lined winter leggings that I have. That\u2019s not a big deal to me but, if you are specifically looking for warm and/or thick leggings, these aren\u2019t it. Otherwise, they are absolutely perfect.",

They are nice and stretchy so if you want compression, these are not for you, but if you want comfort and a buttery soft feeling, I highly recommend these. The only issue, which is minor at best, is the pockets are a bit too high (almost up to my hip where other leggings I own are lower on the thigh making it easier for reaching the cell phone without lifting up your shirt). This is just a personal preference for me and may not matter to you. Still highly worth it. Given the fit, I probably could've gone with the large or extra large as they stretch nice and don't roll down on my tummy or constrict in any way, which is great if you have any gastrointestinal issues and can't handle pressure on the belly.",

                "reviewText": "Happy to have disregarded the size chart. According to it, I should have bought a size L-XL for my 30 inch waist, but these pants are replacing another brand's S-M that are too loose on me now, so I took a chance. I wanted compression vs relaxed, and that is pretty much what I got with these, though I would have preferred them to be slightly tighter in the thighs.For reference, I am 5'4, 140lbs. After a 120lb weightloss, my physique is \"formerly fat\" - as in very much pliable. This is why size charts and measurements don't mean as much to me as they may to someone with a firmer form.One thing I want to point out is how tall the waist is on these. I don't believe I have a short torso, but these pants make it seem like I do! Pulled up, they reach the bottom of my bra.. Fortunately turning the waist down is an option, and this provides additional belly compression, which is a plus.I have yet to wash then wear these, so I can't speak to any wash/dry or shrinkage issues. If I encounter any, I will update.",
