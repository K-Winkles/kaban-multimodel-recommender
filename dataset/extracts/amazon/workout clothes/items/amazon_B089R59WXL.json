The fabric is lightweight and has a smooth finish so lint/cat hair is not sticking. I will probably live in these now.",

                "reviewText": "Great to not have to pay 100 bucks for Athleta petite city joggers!!! Score for us shorter ladies!! These pants actually fall in the right spots on our legs and knees. They\u2019re not just shorter in length \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffbFor reference, I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d 117 pounds and these are the purple ones.I usually get an XS in joggers and leggings, but i needed a size Small in these. The highwaisted waistband is tiny. Though that\u2019s not necessarily a problem area for me, I\u2019m straight like a boy there. No curves. No tiny cinched waist. I probably could have used another 1/2\u201d-1\u201d there. But the fabric of the waistband is soft and comfy, so it\u2019s not bothersome.NOTE: I have one leg that\u2019s shorter than the other, so no the waistband isn\u2019t sewn more curved on one side. It just looks that way b/c one hip sticks out more than the other.The fabric is lovely too. But be careful with your panty line. Though the fabric is not chonchy, it\u2019s too thin to be worn without a layer between the pants and your cheeks in order to be proper. You just need that extra thin slip like layer. Can\u2019t be cotton b/c it\u2019ll cling. Target has some great silky options in their Auden line in the little drawers.",
