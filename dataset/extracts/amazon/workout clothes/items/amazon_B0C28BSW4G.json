                "reviewText": "These weren't quite what I expected when they arrived. My initial reaction was they were super thin material. However, I tried them on since I had them and they fit well. Because the material is so thin and flimsy, these would be better during the warmer months when you don't want something heavy, but don't want to wear shorts. These are lightweight and thin enough that it'll be comfortable. This is too lightweight for the colder months though. They're also so lightweight that they can even double as lounge around the house pants or pajama bottoms actually, so there are some redeeming qualities about this.",

I also bought base layers to wear beneath them, so I should be ok, but these are not the thicker material I think of when I think of sweatpants. These pants are about the same weight and thickness as the base-layer pants, only looser. On the positive side, the sizing is as expected and I will be able to wear these longer into the Spring when it warms up, as long as they hold up through the winter first.",
