                "reviewText": "For reference, I am 5'7\" tall, 130#, and wear size 4 in jeans. When clothing is real tight, I often size up, which is why I ordered these yoga shorts in size Medium. Glad I did. These shorts seem to be made of a fairly thick, good quality material. They are definitely tight. I would not have been comfortable in size Small. I love how high-waisted they are, and smoothly cover the whole belly without cutting into the waist at the top edge. I like the leg length, which seems to have approximately a 3.5\" inseam. So the butt is not hanging out.What I don't like is that the part below the wide waist/belly band is a little looser, so it shows any bulges and panty lines. I probably will mainly wear these under dresses, or working out at home. Thank you!",
