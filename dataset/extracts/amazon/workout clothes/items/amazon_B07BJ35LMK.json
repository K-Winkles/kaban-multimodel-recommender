These pants are a perfect fit for me, and the fabric isvery comfortable to wear during workouts or just casual hangouts on the weekend.The sleek and stylish design makes these pants perfect for wearing outside the gym.One thing to note is that the pants are a little thin, which is not a significant issueas I prefer lighter materials during my workouts. Additionally, I lovethe pockets with zippers, which are very handy for carrying small items like keys ora phone.Overall, I am delighted with my purchase of the Zengvee Gym Pants. If you are looking fora great pair of gym and casual wear pants, these are worth considering. Theyare comfortable, fit well, and have practical pockets with zippers.",
