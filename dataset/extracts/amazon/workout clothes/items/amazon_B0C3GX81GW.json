                "reviewText": "I purchased this bra for everyday use and working out in. I'm big-busted, a double D and have difficulty finding bras that provide support/ lift - I'm 53- while looking attractive at the same time. For the last five years I've used New Balance's Shockingly Unshocking Sports Bra, whose support I love so much I used them as everyday bras, however they are itchy and have pronounced seams so it was obvious I was wearing a sports bra. I've been on a mission to find a bra that works- all of those Instagram ads sucked me in and I'm ashamed at how much money I've wasted on bras that are comfortable but don't support, or seem supportive but don't have adjustable straps, or have detachable insert cups that wrinkle and fall out. I feel like this bra fits my needs in so many ways- it is very well made, breathable, provides excellent support and hold while being soft and comfortable. The padding is sewn in- which I prefer- and the seams are off to the side and don't show under clothing. The only drawback I would say is that this bra does not have adjustable straps. Thankfully, I was able to pull the back down and it stays, giving me a more customized fit and hold. No sagging or bouncing. I bought a second one and will probably buy a few more. This has become my new go-to bra.",

Used it on a run and the padding moved constantly and I had a lot of back strain after that run from poor bra support. Otherwise it is a nice functional bra that is flattering on the chest for everyday wear in my opinion.",

I go to the gym 6 days a week doing lifting as well as high impact cardio. I thought no way is this going to be good but it could hold me over until I can splurge for another high impact under armour. My current under armour is worn out and needed discarded. Ya'all this is better. So comfy, no uniboob, holds in my ginormous girls, and I also work at a gym so its comfy enough to wear for a shift with no irritation.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this bra seems nice and fairly comfortable. As others have noted, the zipper is not the most sturdy and came off track the first time I put it on. I was able to get it fixed and it held up through a 6 mile run after that, though.My biggest issue is the band is definitely bigger than the size chart suggests. I am a 34 C and I had to return the suggested medium because everything was going to fall out the bottom. Even the small is a little looser than I would like, but it did okay on this run and will be fine for lower impact gym workouts, so I\u2019ll keep it.I\u2019d say if you\u2019re a slimmer, medium-busted person looking for a high-impact bra for running, this is probably not the best choice, but it\u2019s not a bad bra overall, especially for the price.",

Has two hooks in front to help you zipper up but it was hard to zipper unless you pulled the bra up over your breasts and zipped then pulled the bra down over your breasts did the trick. I love that the cups are sewn in. My only issue right now after wearing for a couple of hours is that it squishes you in smooshes your breasts almost feel like I\u2019m suffocating. I haven\u2019t decided if I am going to return it or not. The zipper stayed in. It shows a lot of cleavage on me. I\u2019m not that concerned about that because I wear tshirts for working outdoors. I would suggest buying a size up.",
