                "reviewText": "It\u2019s very hard to give fair star rating because there are two very different quality rompers that you could end up with.I first bought 2 of these, green & black. The green one arrived with in a couple days, I loved it! Material is great quality, perfect compression, accentuates the shape of your body, cinches in your waist without feeling like you can\u2019t breathe. The color is a bit ash or Heather green, very pretty. Online the picture of the black one looks like the exact same great quality material as the green one, but it\u2019s completely different in person! It took 2 weeks to get here. I was so excited when it arrived but when I opened it, I was very disappointed, it\u2019s paper thin, even though it\u2019s black, you can totally see through it & it\u2019s bigger even though they\u2019re both medium. I want to order more but I\u2019m afraid that I will end up with another one made of the same horrible material as the black one.UPDATEI took a chance & ordered black again & a gray one, I love them both! They both arrived quickly & both are made with the great quality material.From my experience, If the shipping date is within a week, you will get the good quality from the local Amazon warehouse but if it\u2019s gonna be a couple weeks before it arrives, you\u2019re gonna get the crappy one from China.UPDATE #2I ordered 2 more, the light blue and neon pink. The blue one arrived within a couple days & just as I thought, it was the made with the great quality material, I love it! The pink one took a couple weeks & when I opened it, sure enough, it was made of the cheap material & this time it was so small that even if I did like it, I couldn\u2019t even get it over my hips. I\u2019m giving 5 stars because some rompers are worthy of it & the store is very good about refunds.",

I decided to go for it and i\u2019m so glad i did! i\u2019m 5\u20198 and 145 lbs and i got my normal size, medium. It fits literally like a dream, a bit short for my long torso but it\u2019s stretchy so it\u2019s all good. I love the padding, it\u2019s pretty supportive. I\u2019m a 34 c/d and it\u2019s a good fit. there is a bit of gapping on my rib cage but that\u2019s fine. And it gives the illusion that i have curves, and i mean coming from someone who looks like a door that\u2019s a lot!!! I was having trouble paring it with things but i found that just a button up cardigan is super cute or hoodie, and since it\u2019s tight you could even wear it with some baggy jeans over it. If your skeptical like me, just try it out, i think it was a great purchase\ud83d\ude0a",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical to buy this, but for $12 I figured why not.I love it!! I\u2019m fairly petit, 126lbs, small chest. Got the small. I actually feel like I could have managed with a medium, but the fit is tight of course and very flattering.The black one has really nice material, doesn\u2019t feel cheap or thin at all. I love the cups, you don\u2019t need to wear any sort of bra at all. If you have larger chest, you might find this doesn\u2019t work for you.The legs of this do kind of ride up and I found myself adjusting several times throughout the day. Maybe the medium would have been a little better.The top in my photo I also bought from Amazon, it paired perfectly!I can say that I do recommend the black one since that\u2019s all I can speak for. Comfortable to wear, and super cute on!",

                "reviewText": "For reference, I am 5'2\", 120 pounds, 34B bra size, slim build with short torso and long legs.This romper is cute but kind of ill-fitting and looks a little cheap. The material is very thick which is nice, but it is almost too stiff making it a bit uncomfortable at times. The super thick material also means I get a uni-butt unless I really hike this up into my booty. The legs ride up really bad just from sitting or walking and therefore it is not great for working out. Definitely better for lounging. The bust part is a bit weird and feels too big, not very secure. It can be cute for a casual or lazy outfit but definitely not for activity.",

I bought a Medium in black because I didn\u2019t buy this as snatchwear\u2026I wanted to be smooth and versatile on the regular yet still able to digest my food properly. I get serious heartburn when I wear stuff that\u2019s too \u201csnatchy\u201d. I\u2019m a mom and I needed something that I could wear to bed comfortably so I could pop on a top and some shoes and get the kids to school in the am. I love the bra. It has sewn-in pads, is padded enough to cover my aggressively visible nipple situation and has a nice understated cup shape. I also love the shorts. They don\u2019t dig into my thighs and disappear well enough under my jeans. Love the ribbed fabric also. I\u2019ll buy another for regular rotation.",
