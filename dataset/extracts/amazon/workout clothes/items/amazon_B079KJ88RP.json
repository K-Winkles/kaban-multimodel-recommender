                "reviewText": "Ladies, we've stumbled upon something incredible with the PUMA Seamless Sports Bra! My daughter and I are absolutely in love with it, and the funniest part is that my husband is now utterly befuddled whenever he does the laundry.This sports bra has everything we could ask for. It's comfortable, supportive, and stylish \u2013 the triple threat in athletic wear. The seamless design ensures that it feels like a second skin, perfect for intense workouts or lounging around the house. And that PUMA logo? It's the cherry on top, adding a touch of sporty flair.But here's where the laughter begins. My daughter and I are such fans that we each have our own PUMA Seamless Sports Bra. Now, picture this: my husband, attempting to be helpful, volunteers for laundry duty. He dutifully gathers our sports bras, ready to toss them in the wash, only to find himself bewildered by the \"which one belongs to who\" mystery.It's become a running joke in our household. My husband often throws his hands up in defeat, exclaiming, \"I can't tell whose bra is whose!\" It's all in good fun, and we can't help but giggle as he tries to solve the ultimate sports bra puzzle.In all seriousness, the PUMA Seamless Sports Bra has brought an unexpected dose of humor into our lives. It's a top-tier bra that's worth every star of this review, and it's turned our laundry days into a hilarious game of \"guess who.\" If you want style, comfort, and a good laugh, this bra is a must-try. Just be prepared for the laundry room comedy show \u2013 it's all part of the package!",

                "reviewText": "I like this sports bra for the most part. The pros: It is super cute in the front and back where the straps crisscross. The pads or inserts are great because they stay where I want them and don\u2019t slide around when wearing. When washing they stay inside the bra and hold their shape. They don\u2019t come out in the washer (delicate cycle only and hang to dry) with those weird creases and wrinkles in them like some of my other sports bras. The cons: this bra has the crisscross straps in the front cleavage area. While this is a super cute design and looks great on the model, unless you are large busted the straps sort of sag. I ordered a Large, and am usually a 34-36 B, almost a C. While I don\u2019t see myself as well endowed up top, I am certainly not flat chested. With that being said, the straps do sag in the middle cleavage area and stick out of the tops of my dry fit tanks that I wear to the gym. It is a bit annoying. So if you are big busted you probably won\u2019t have any issues. If you are not, just keep in mind those cute little decorative crisscrossed straps at the cleavage will not be completely taut. Otherwise this is a fairly comfortable bra with decent support.",

It's tight enough to provide support, but not so constricting that it bothers me. I like this one because it doesn't go up too high under the armpits which is my main problem with sports bra. Stays in place when I jump around too! Very nice, PUMA!",

                "reviewText": "This by far is the best sports bra I\u2019ve worn. It supports my bust, and doesn\u2019t make the girls bounce when I\u2019m moving. (I\u2019m big breasted, so I got a large. If I buy this again, I might try an XL just to see if it flirts better.) That was the most relieving part about this purchase. It doesn\u2019t flatten my bosom but it does support me.The one thing to note though is that it is rather tight across the chest. I made the mistake one time of wearing it all day. By the end of the day, I was starting to get breathless and breathing hard. On other days, I usually just change in or out of it when I go to work out and after I finish.If you are looking for a bra that keeps you from juggling while you work out, then this is it. You might consider a size up to avoid your bra being too tight; otherwise, opt for your usual size.",

I am a 32C and the small fit me perfectly without being too tight and was very supportive.The only negative thing about it is the bright pink color bleeding! When I was rinsing my bra in the bathrom sink, I noticed the bleeding so I tried to remove all the color before putting it in the washing machine. The next day before I stated the washing machine, I checked to make sure there was no more bleeding but after rinsing it again, there was more bleeding! I ended up handwashing it to avoid getting my other clothes stained. Hopefully after a few wash, it will stop!",
