They are very breathable and comfortable to wear when going to the gym, or when hanging out at home. 5 pairs was enough for me to have gym shorts for each day I go to the gym and I haven't had a single complaint about these shorts. The material seems like it might wear down/rip at some point within the next 2 years if I had to guess but for the price I can't really complain.",

                "reviewText": "I have two sets of these shorts, one I purchased in august of 2020 and one in august 2021. Clearly I went back to buy another set a year later so I must like them, and I do. They are priced INCREDIBLY well. At the time of the first purchase, I had just started playing sports again and needed lightweight shorts to cut and move in. These are DEFINITELY those shorts. They breath very well, they're comfortable enough that now I not only work out in them, I lounge around the house in them and go to sleep in them as well. They've held up pretty well to washing. I wash them on hot with powdered detergent and oxiclean powder and rinse them twice and then dry them on medium heat. They've probably gone through at least 100 washes thus far and I'm still wearing them. Yes, some of the seams have loose thread, yes some of them start to come off over time but they're $6 a short and none of them have unraveled to the point that there are any holes or they are unwearable, it's just something you would see when you look at the inner part of the waistband.The ONE weakness of these shorts is the pockets. I've had several that have started developing holes in the side seams of the pockets. Now it only started happening a year+ later and they've been beat up and washed many times so that's not quite so bad, but still it'll happen. I suspect this is more to do with how big and heavy phones are nowadays since it's always on my right pocket (where my phone goes) and started pretty much after I upgraded from an iphone 7 to an iphone 13 pro. But two years and 100+ aggressive washings later, only 3 out of 10 shorts have pocket holes and only one has a hole big enough that I'm scared to put my phone in the pocket.These are fantastic shorts and they could easily charge double. I plan to replace some of the original ones with a new set even now.",

I lived through the 80\u2019s and will never wear short shorts again. The fabric is cool to the touch and moisture dissipates quickly. These do not snag as easily as other shorts I\u2019ve owned but they will if they catch on something. Overall, I\u2019m happy with my second purchase and will order them again.",

Another important thing to mention is that when stretched, they are translucent since the fabric is not very thick. So make sure you use compression pants or dark undergarments beneath these shorts. Otherwise, they work well for exercises that need lots of flexibility, squatting, etc. They are also very comfortable to wear at home! I love this product and will probably order more in the future. Great money value and great quality. Very satisfied!",
