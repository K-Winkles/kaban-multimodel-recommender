Not too tight- just right. I love the flare on the ends and look great with leisure shoes or workout shoes.I got the green pair and I just love the color. I'm known as the green pants girl at work and it's pretty funny but I promise it's in a good way. I got a size medium and I'm a size 8 and at 143 lbs. (Hopefully this is helpful for others).I want every color they offer! Got the light pink ones in my cart for when this momma is able to get more!Also if this helpful, my job is a stocking job and they are comfy while also being durable for doing a physical labor job. I do wear them around the house because of how comfy they are. I'd say you can work in them, be lazy in them, do housework in them, and go around doing errands around town with them. Overall great pants!Highly recommend!",

I never get flared leggings bc the small is always too short and any larger size is saggy around my non existent butt. I got XS, 32 in inseam. Fits just right; hits right at the floor, fitted around thighs and butt, a little tight but not uncomfortably so. Tight enough that I feel like the small would also have still fit nicely and may try it on my next order of these leggings because I will definitely be buying more!",
