                "reviewText": "Whitney Simmons x GymShark DUPE!!! These leggings are incredible bro the v cut stitching on the butt is lifting and cinches your waist to make you look snatched! They kinda roll a little bit but it's not terrible. They're so comfy, so soft, stay in place!! Like they don't fall down halfway through a workout to where you have crotch sag. They also don't give you cameltoe which is super cool. They're so thin and light, but FULL COVERAGE and squat proof (at least this color is). I immediately went and bought three more pairs in other colors and waiting til next paycheck to get the rest of the colors because you CANNOT beat this quality of legging at this price. I got a size M, I'm 5'4\" 160 and my measurements are 32\" waist 44\" hips. They fit perfectly! They look tiny coming out of the package but are super stretchy, but have lots of compression in the belly at the same time. Literally could not be happier!!!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Don't love this version due to the scrunch, but great customer service.",
                "reviewText": "I bought these after seeing lots of girls in our Fit Finds FB group gush about them. I was never going to spend the money on the WS x GS collection (if I could even snag a pair before they sold out) but loved the look of them, especially the scrunch and laser detail on the back, so I was pretty excited to see this dupe show up and get great reviews.To be transparent, I absolutely adore leggings and have tons of pairs from Amazon, AliExpress, and many other more expensive brands. I wear them every chance I get because I think they are really flattering and comfortable as hell. Aligns or the Amazon Hawthorne/HeyNutz ones that are very similar are my daily go-tos, and I like Wunder Unders or similar slick things for the gym, so that will give you an idea of what I prefer. I'm pretty open to any brand or price, as long as they're great for the gym and/or comfortable and flattering, or just a good lounging pair. I'm normally a black leggings kind of girl but decided to branch out and try this gorgeous GREEN, and then later DANDELION BROWN, and both are super cute. I'd say the colors are true to the picture. They aren't the most cellulite friendly, but I expect that with pretty much any color that isn't black or patterned. I got a MEDIUM in the GREEN pair and a LARGE in the DANDELION BROWN pair. I have pretty consistently been a size medium in leggings for years, but I've recently gained some more weight, so I'm more on the true large side now. I'm 5'3\" and I think my measurements are about 43-33-43 (bust-waist-hip) right now, unfortunately, and I'm a 10 or 12 in AE jeans, depending on the pair. That being said, both the medium and large fit me great and about the same, so take that into consideration when trying to determine your size. They are super stretchy.While I think these have potential, these two versions (aka the original with laser detail and newer without it) are just not my thing. Both pairs fit me great, but the scrunch completely stretched out and made me look like I had a slightly wrinkly butt-crack, which is not really the look I was going for. It's hard to tell in my pictures, but I promise, that's what it looked like. I think the scrunch is just too weak and a big butt stretches it out. I've been told that Tom Tiger plans on fixing it, so I have high hopes for future versions! They do help give a little glute separation, so some may love that it's way more subtle than something like the Alphalete Amplifies with their very intense scrunch. I guess I just wanted something a little more in-between.Also, for those of you that hate WAISTBAND SEAMS in leggings, like me, you should note that both versions do have a seam there, but NO ELASTIC BAND! It's just a thin sewn seam around the top of the waistband. I would definitely prefer they find a way to just make it a folded material waistband and do away with the seam, but it doesn't bother me too much, just cuts into my fat a little bit. Due to my short torso, I also have issues with leggings rolling a lot on my waist, and these definitely rolled a bit.I did enjoy the cute laser cutout on the back and the general shapes of the seams, but I found the lack of a front seam, and the higher seams of the front waistband, made my lower tummy area look pooched out. I unfortunately hold some weight there right now so just didn't feel confident in them. If you are lean in your tummy area, that wouldn't be an issue for you, obviously. I wish that waist seam sat a bit lower to give me some compression, but I don't know how that would look.The other thing I didn't love about these is the material. I'm not great at describing this sort of thing, but these are like a super thin but slick material, and they honestly feel a bit cheap. They aren't rough, just not my favorite. I also had some of those line dye marks on the butt and a few on the front and legs of both pairs, as you may be able to spy in the photo of the Green pair. I come across this issue with random leggings on occasion. I assume it has something to do with how they are stored, maybe the dye process, and/or them being folded for extended periods of time in different temperatures so the dye settles in those folds. We'll see if they go away with a wash.Despite the things I didn't love, I do still recommend everyone try these for themselves, and like I said, I have high hopes for future versions. I really like the company, as they are very interested in customer feedback and actually listen to critique. I highly recommend anyone that loves leggings add Tom Tiger (and their sister company, Aurolas) on Instagram and Facebook so you can interact with them. They are very responsive and open to suggestions.TLDR: I got a Medium in Green, Large in Dandelion Brown; both fit about the same. These have a sewn seam without an elastic band around the top of the waistband. The butt-scrunch doesn't really do much but help with some glute separation. The material is thin and kind of slick, feels a bit cheap; not my favorite. They are not cellulite friendly in these two colors, but who cares. While not my fav, I still recommend people try them to see how they feel! We all like different things. I also really like the company.",

Adem\u00e1s, no se meten en \u00e1reas inc\u00f3modas \ud83d\ude05Yo compr\u00e9 el paquete de dos leggings que por el precio creo que vale mucho la pena.Los recomiendo mucho, pronto volver\u00e9 a comprar otros colores.",

The leggings seems to be squat proof at least for now but the panty lines will be very much visible because the material is so thin. I loved that these leggings had a triangle shape on the back and no freaking thong simulation. Overall they are very flattering and they create hourglass silhouette",
