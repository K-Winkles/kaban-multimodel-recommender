                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the cute stylish yoga top, and while I am pleased with certain aspects, there are a few considerations to keep in mind. The design of the yoga top is undeniably adorable, and its stylish flair adds a touch of fashion to my workout wardrobe. The patterns and colors are vibrant, creating a visually appealing look that stands out in a yoga class. The fabric used is of high quality \u2014 breathable, lightweight, and comfortable against the skin. It offers excellent moisture-wicking properties, keeping me cool and dry during intense yoga sessions.However, my enthusiasm is tempered by the sizing of the top. I ordered my usual size, but it turned out to be a little too small for my liking. I recommend potential buyers consider sizing up for a more relaxed and comfortable fit.Despite the sizing issue, I must acknowledge that the top performs exceptionally well during yoga sessions. The stretchy material allows for flexibility and ease of movement, and the cut is designed to stay in place, providing the coverage needed for various poses. The snug fit may work well for those who prefer a more body-hugging style, but it's essential to keep personal comfort preferences in mind when choosing a size.",

My cup size is a B36. Maybe the Small would fit perfectly for someone with my same measurements but with a longer torso or someone who is taller by a few inches. Highly recommend for someone who works out a lot and wants to hide the tummy area but loves showing off a detailed sports bra on the back.",
