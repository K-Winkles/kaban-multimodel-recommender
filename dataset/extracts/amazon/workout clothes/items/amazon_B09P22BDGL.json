I bought them in 2 different sizes, so I could have some that fit normally and some that are very loose. I saw other reviews that said the v- neck was too deep, but mine are not, even in the biggest size. They're perfect. They are super silky smooth and lightweight, and do NOT have that weird texture where if you have dry skin it feels really awful and gets hung up on your skin. They don't seem to wrinkle at all and always look nice. Have never seen anything stain them, either. They dry really fast, too. They are a little longer than most shirts, but I prefer that. Kinda wish they made pants out of this material.",
