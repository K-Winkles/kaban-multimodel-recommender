I know these are for activity, but I bought them to have something to keep me warm inside, but without the added bulk of a long sleeve shirt (I live in the desert, so sometimes you only want to keep slightly warm). But these shirts are very versatile, I actually wore one out to walk around it surprisingly very comfortable. It even held up to some brushes with thorn bushes etc. One thing I loved immediately, though, was that this shirt resists pet hair!! Like I was kinda amazed by that in comparison to my other shirts which are like hair magnets. I'd totally buy more of these, but I don't have TOO much use for long sleeves in the desert. But would definitely buy again if I needed to replace. They fit me almost perfectly, too. Not overly baggy, not too tight, just right.",

That is exactly what I wanted so I can wear them in a very hot country that makes men wear long-sleeved shirts. They will also dry quickly after a wash in the sink.Other buyers recommended buying one size larger than usual and I did just that: I am very glad that I ordered XXL instead of my usual XL.These shirts also look very nice and fit comfortably.

Fits well with the exception that the sleeves are a bit long and loose but when buying in these type sizes it\u2019s hard to dial in everything perfectly. Very comfortable. After only one wash, the cuff on one shirt has started to unravel but that can be easily fixed with needle and thread. Would buy again at this price.",

They are lightweight and yet serve the purpose of being warm. The fabric is substantial feeling and the stitching is strong. They wash and dry very nicely and no pilling. I can't address the sun protection or the working out.",

I'm not sure how much sun protection it offers since quite a lot of light passes through two layers of this material.",
