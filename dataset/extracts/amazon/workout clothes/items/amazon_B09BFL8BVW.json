                "reviewText": "I've always had at least 5 adidas shorts and 5 t-shirts. I've tried the competing options like under armour and Nike. I've tried the cheaper options or the ones that are 2 or 3 items for the same price as adidas then regret it and paid the higher price for adidas. I love adidas, for me, it fits well, looks good and feels good and always paid the price for the quality. This time however, I wanted to try 2 in 1 shorts with inner compression shorts with the phone holder and inevitably I didn't like some the current options available after I tried them. Adidas does have 2 in 1 option with compression but no phone holder and found this shorts totally worth it, lighter fabric than the other 2 in 1 options I've tried with phone pocket, not too long not too short, above the knee, quicker dry, more comfortable and at least $10-15 less than adidas. I'm not running long distance for now, I do run anywhere from 3-7 miles 3-4 times a week and I do hot yoga daily. This shorts are great for my activity level so I now have 3 of them and ordering 1 more. I'm not bashing adidas, all my tops and some sweaters are still adidas. I just replaced 3 of running t-shirts with adidas t-shirts and just bought a running light jacket for the winter morning runs. Nevertheless, this shorts I found to be great!! I have iPhone 12 and it holds great and firm enough. With the savings on the price I got the 4th. one. I do research before I buy and I wanted to share this on a way that could help others. Hope this helps.",

                "reviewText": "These are great fitting and looking shorts. The design is terrific - pockets are well-paced. Colours are muted and logo is unobtrusive.My first pair were near perfect - I felt the inner shorts/lining a little on the thin side and my phone (Samsung Galaxy 57) moved a bit on running. It hasn't fallen out and I got used to some subtle movement. Fit was perfect and as advertised. I bought a second pair: the inner lining is thinner still and so the phone jumps about too much for running. They are just as comfortable in fit and look great. This is a pity and I suppose reflects on quality control. The upside of the thinnish lining is they are extremely comfortable.",
