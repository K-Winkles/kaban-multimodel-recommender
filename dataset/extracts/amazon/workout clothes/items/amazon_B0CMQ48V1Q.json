The fabric is very soft, doesn\u2019t wrinkle at all, doesn\u2019t shrink, and was really moisture-wicking during my workout this morning. I will say that compared to some of their other styles, this is a bit more \u201cboxy\u201d. The arm holes have more gap than what I prefer. But that\u2019s just a minor detail that many people wouldn\u2019t even notice. I love the high neck and slits on the sides. Super cute!",

I am long-waisted and this top is a perfect length, which is a wonderful thing that I don't always get to experience. I enjoy wearing this, the way it moves and flows with me, which makes it excellent for yoga. The interesting thing is how it looked equally lovely when I wore it under a sweater cardigan for work! I can very easily recommend this top!",
