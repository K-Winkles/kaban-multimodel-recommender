If you like being an exhibitionist these might be up your alley. The colors are so garish I wouldn\u2019t dare be seen wearing them in public. Poor workmanship. On one pair the left pocket seam was not sewn shut making that pocket useless. I purchased a size larger than what I normally wear expecting shrinkage but these went right back in the bag for return so am not sure what would happen if I washed them.",

                "reviewText": "We'll start with the good. These joggers feel very nice next to the skin. They fit snug, but not too tight. They are lightweight & surprisingly warm. If I had written this review after wearing them once, I'd have given them 5 stars. But then I washed them ...When they came out of the wash, there were so many loose threads I had to start cutting thru them with scissors. I thought I had gotten all of them, but every time I put my hands in the pocket or adjusted the drawstring I found more. They still fit wonderfully, but now I am worrying they will fall apart after 3-4 washes !Bottom line is, I do like them. Very much. I am just concerned about their durability. I will post an update in a couple of months ... if they last that long !UPDATE: So of the 3 pairs, one is in perfect shape, one has a hole in one pocket & the crotch, and the last one has lost more than HALF the stitching that hold the waist band & drawstring. So I can wear ONE of them out in public, the other two are just for lounging at home ... and that may come to end in a moth or so the way things are going. It is a shame because I really DID like these the first time I wore them. But the QC issues are too much. Would not recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I've only had these for a few months, and have probably only washed each sub ten times. That being said, they're falling apart rapidly. Each wash, including the very first one, pulls multiple threads from them. I've washed them as softly as I can, following the instructions as best I can. It doesn't help.Every wash is more and more strings I'm having to trim from the pants. I doubt I'll even have viable pants to wear within another month or so. Do not purchase, they're a waste of time and money.",
