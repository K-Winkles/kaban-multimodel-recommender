While I don't expect any \"heavy\" duty lifting or support from this bra while I'm running, playing pickle ball or doing cardio, it is a perfect runner up as a well supportive undergarment for form fitting dresses, summer tops and so much more. If you're looking for a sports bra--go buy one. But if you're looking for a cute, bra that will give you all day support and not look like a harness for tig bitties--this is your bra! I recommend it, highly.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely adore this. I am generally a size M in tops with bra size 34DD/M or L for sports bras. I ordered the Large in this and it is awesome (also tried M - see below). It holds you in great and is super flattering. I LOVE the shelf inside this! I've never been able to go \"bra-less\" in tank tops and this is a game changer. I have worn this with high waisted jeans as a crop tank and also as a workout tank doing HIIT and on a walk. Haven't tried it running yet though but I typically like thicker straps when doing more running based activities. However, these straps feel very sturdy. I bought this more for classes and for wearing as a tank top so this is FANTASTIC and fits that bill perfectly. Note that I've never put it through the wash and there is already a bit of pilling at the seam so be aware of that - I will see how it holds up over time and probably will hand wash it.I did try a M and it was too tight and constricting and made me get some fat rolls underneath the band so that was a no for me. I also bought the white color in XL and that also fits well - I don't think it's *quite* as supportive as the black because it's a bit bigger but I intend to use it as a tank top and not as a workout top so it doesn't have to be as supportive imo. It's still supportive enough that my larger-ish boobs aren't falling out all over the place and look nice and perky in the top. Cups are removable.Literally going to be buying this in any color I can get my hands on.",

(Blue, black, pink, & white) The tank top is VERY comfortable, the bra padding is supportive during a workout and more importantly, the bra pads don\u2019t fall out in the dryer. Definitely recommend sizing up. This product is great, just runs VERY small. For reference, I typically am a medium. I bought this in a large and an XL. Both sizes fit, but I personally think the XL fits better and is more comfortable.",

While my kid doesn't always tell me she likes things, I have seen this shirt in the laundry every week, so I know she is wearing it. It is a modern style and keeps everything where it is supposed to be. My daughter has a very thin build and has a hard time finding tops that fit well. If you have a kid with a ballerina build, this is the top for her. Also, the pads do not fall out in the wash cycle which is a huge plus when it comes to shirts with built in bras. Putting those things back in is a chore as I never know which way it is supposed to go.",

Allow alittle for shrinkage. Cold water be on safe side. This is a nice color. Comfortable material. Thank you, Kathleen",

                "reviewText": "These tank tops have been my summer addiction! I now have 4 colors of them and are seriously obsessed. Being larger-chested they really do hold everything in and up. I have been able to golf, play tennis and pickleball, weight-lift and do all daily activities without any worry of anything falling out or having to make adjustments throughout while wearing these.I did originally buy these as more at-home loungewear due to how some tank tops can not be suitable for outside wear with a larger chest and was so excited with how comfortable yet appropriate they are. The material is thick and none of the colors I have received yet have been see-through in the slightest. There is a built in bra shelf so the support is there and nothing shows through.I will note that I have ordered the same size (38DDD- I ordered xl\u2019s) and some of them do fit slightly differently. The black and olive green are a bit looser and the material is stretchier. The light blue and pink one are a less stretchy material and tighter but regardless, they have all fit great and all held up in the same manner.",

But I decided to keep it as the top is quite comfortable to wear, it fits nicely and looks great. I like to have bra and top in one product. I would like to have the same top in a non-cropped style, please!",

En verdad esta prenda est\u00e1 p\u00e9sima y no tiene nada que ver con el producto que el vendedor ofrece.
