It\u2019s incredibly flattering, and this is coming from someone who is 5\u20191.5\u201d, 140, curvy with large hips and very fleshy arms lol. I got a medium and it fits perfectly. My arms and shoulders are what tend to be my problem area when it comes to clothes. Items may fit everywhere fine, but then it\u2019s tight in my arms and shoulders. But this works great because of how stretchy and soft it is. I was debating between the large and medium and I\u2019m glad I got the medium. I\u2019m obsessed with the back!The ONLY thing I\u2019m bummed about is the light blue is EVER so slightly more deep than in the picture. It\u2019s def still a light blue, but it\u2019s not quite as baby light pastel blue as the image. But that\u2019s the only complaint and that\u2019s a minor one!",

                "reviewText": "It is always difficult to shop online for clothing. This top looked stylish and airy, so I went for it, and even ordered one size up to make sure the slit, open part would not leave too much in the air. Well...I don't know if their sizes are for children, but Medium (I always order Small for anything T-shirt- like) got to past my navel, and wasn't so in loose... The feel of the shirt is very soft and light, as expected. It would be comfortable if fitting, but I don't think would really be flattering if rolls of fat or skin pour through. In other words, measure yourself if you want to order the right size for you, and don't go by their sizing chart.",

I love it so much I had to order 3 more. They have different styles that are just gorgeous too. Can\u2019t wait for them to come in. I did read some reviews that said after washing it was hard to get the wrinkles out so I\u2019ll update if I find that same problem. For now I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a problem. I highly recommend this company and their product to anyone, plus you can\u2019t beat the price.",

It is very soft and the color is great but it seems like after just one or two washes it might start pilling and falling apart. It\u2019s also VERY boxy and not form fitting at all. I regret not just putting the money toward something that will actually last. This seems like an average old navy style tee to me.",
