                "reviewText": "I received a size large in this four pack of leggings. The colors included were: two black identical pairs (which I appreciate since black goes with everything), a light gray and a darker gray. I usually wear a medium in leggings and these fit nicely. They had a nice tummy control panel and two deep side pockets. The stitching of the side pockets went all the way down to the bottom of the hems of the leggings and it looks good. These leggings are a polyester and spandex blend and it makes them very soft to the touch.Because I did get a large in these leggings, the fit was long on me (I am 5 feet tall and about 140lbs) and so I had to 'bunch up' or fold the bottom of the leggings, which I did not mind. They were not super tight on me because of the sizing and I did not mind that. They were comfortable to wear in this size and I did not feel like I was being squeezed all day. I also liked that they did not stretch out at all after I wore them all day. They were comfy to wear, did not slip down or sag in any way, and they looked really good. If I were to use them for a workout, I would order a size down.I was very happy with these leggings...good addition to my activewear!",

They don\u2019t droop and sag at the end of the day, but keep their shape and stay tight and look good.In a few months, if they hold up as well as they are indicating now, I will buy them in all the colors.

They are heavy weight, soft and amazingly, they stay up and don\u2019t roll over. They\u2019re a little longer in the rise than I would prefer, but they do stay put. I ordered a medium since I\u2019ve got a few extra holiday pounds. Probably, could have gone with a small. Winner!",

They offer some tummy control without being tight or restricting. And the price is very fair. Buy them!",

But then I thought these, in my normal size, looked too small. However, thankfully, I tried a pair on. Wow!! They fit, they are really soft and stretchy, but not see through. They suck in my belly, which is why I worried they wouldn't fit, but they do! I really love \u2764\ufe0f them. So soft and form fitting! None of my jiggly bits jiggle when I have them on. They are the perfect length, too! Yay! Thank you for this awesome set of leggings. Now, I need something to manage under my arms. Those jiggly bits flap and flop. LOL! In case you're wondering, I've gone from 275 pounds to 175 pounds over a period of time, thanks to gastric bypass!! Thus the jiggly bits are excess skin. I know its gross, and Im working on toning up! So, I always think the size I wear now, isn't right!! It's all in my head Any way, Thanks!",

Light compression, but not uncomfortable or causing roll of fat over the waist, but mainly they have a huge pocket on each side, below the hip joint so when you bend, your phone doesn't scooch out. I have iPhone 14 Pro, which is larger than my previous phone. I can't say from personal experience, but I think iPhone Max might even stay in the pocket. I prefer the black and grey, not so much the burgundy, but all of them look nice. Can be worn under jeans for warmth.",

Worst thing is it shows panty lines but most pants anyways\u2026 best purchase I\u2019ve made and best leggings I\u2019ve ever warn. Fit perfectly, helps hide the belly a bit. Pockets are also very good too. I will definitely be buying more of these leggings!!!",
