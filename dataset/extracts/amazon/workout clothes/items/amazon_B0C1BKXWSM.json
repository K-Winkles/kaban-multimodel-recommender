The crossover in the front is super cute. Some people said these were difficult to put the right way. I can admit that they are confusing at first but my little trick is to make sure the tag is on the inside before trying to figure out how to untangle the rest of the bra, it is also easier when you lay it flat to figure it out.",

A size small is perfect for cup size, but I do have a \u201cwide\u201d back and the straps are non-adjustable and a little tight so if you are a little fluffier I would absolutely size up. If I gained a few more pounds I would absolutely be uncomfortable because of the tight straps (every like 2-4lbs more would be significant tightness) even with a tight sort over these sports bras they are still super low profile and doesn\u2019t look bad under a shirt and conceals nipples well (I\u2019m a mother of two and definitely breastfed lol)",

I\u2019m disappointed that I got 2 different products, but they aren\u2019t very comfortable either. The white one feels and looks like a bathing suit. The black one has straps that dig into my shoulders. It\u2019s a lose lose",
