                "reviewText": "Update: i have only washed them, air dried. i want to say that if you're taller than 5'9, i would advise against the 27 in inseam. the crotch keeps falling down between my thighs. i will get the shorter inseam ones next time. i thought i needed the longer length, but honestly, the more i move, the more they pull down. i understand that may be due to the size so i will get an xxl next.I am 5'9, 197lbs. I have long legs and a short torso. My waist size is 38 in, my hips are 45 in. I bought the XL 27 in inseam one in black. Not see through. Opaque. I am super happy that they are not thin as skin like some other brands out there. I love that they are actual leggings, instead of colored nylons. They don't compress the fat around my knees, but there is a slight compression around my middle. They come up past my bellybutton and still reach my ankles. They don't unfold at the waist when i sit. I don't work out i just wanted a nice pair of leggings. The pockets are slim fitted to the thighs so no baggy-ness. They fit me very nice. IF i had went by their size chart, i would've got an xxl. But i decided to go down a size for the compression, and they are very comfortable and i am happy i did. i am not a paid influencer and i didn't receive these as a promotion. Just a real 46 yr old mom of 3. :)",

                "reviewText": "They're comfortable, they look good, they're affordable, the pockets are a nice size; I love these leggings. My only complaint is that the stitching doesn't seem to be of the best quality (lots of loose bits of thread), but I've had two pairs of these (plus two pairs of their fleece-lined ones and two pairs of their bike shorts) and so far all of the seams have held up wonderfully to abuse while hiking or while at work (I drive a tow truck so my pants and leggings tend to get kind of beat up), so all the loose threads I've found are probably just left over from the manufacturing process and not a sign of poor quality. For the price, I can tolerate a few random strings where they don't belong",

I ordered 2 sizes up. wide swath of slight compression across my lower back gave me a backache and leg numbness in about 10 minutes I have central stenosis and try to avoid back pressure. This is compressive. It\u2019s a light compression and I thought it would be OK. I\u2019m shocked it gave me such a reaction.I\u2019m not typical but if you have degenerative disk disease or central stenosis in the lumbar region and find tight / compressive clothing problematic, I would avoid these.",

                "reviewText": "These leggings in white are wonderful! They run a bit big, but not so much that they are loose fitting. They are not see through and are very comfortable. They are not overly thick or heavy, but the material kept me warm. I was on the second time on a hotter day and they actually cut me cooler on that day. It felt like I was wearing my pajamas. I actually bought used to wear under my Halloween costume. When I went to takeoff my costume, I totally forgot I even had them on that is how comfortable they are. The packet is wonderful to put a phone in order, your wallets, credit cards, etc.. I have washed these several times now, and they always come out looking brand new. I will add that I do not throw them in the dryer. I just hang them off or over a chair. I don\u2019t usually throw most of my leggings in the dryer. I highly recommend these they\u2019re very comfortable and a lot of bang for your buck. I believe they are going to last a long time, and I am eager to order them and several other colors. I travel a lot and these will be easy to roll up and put in my bag. My Halloween party was at another destinations, and when I pulled them out, they had no wrinkles. I hope this review helps you and you have as much success with these leggings as I have had.",

                "reviewText": "I have bought at least 4 pairs of these leggings. I love them for walking the dog, lounging, and going to the grocery store, but I do not love these for the gym. Bottom line: they are a great bang for your buck if you aren't planning on doing anything high impact.Pros:+ They are stretchy and extremely comfortable. There is a lot of give in these,.+ They are not really see through (unless they are very stretched out, at which point you should go up a size).+ The leg length and waist height (it's very high waisted) is pretty much perfect for me (a 5'8\" person)+ They are super comfortable and breathable; they are very cool (do not buy these if you want warm leggings)+ They are \"slick\" fabric, so the pilling is minimal where my thighs rub together.+ Super minimal branding and extremely classic style. I love that these are basically just black leggings!+ The pockets are so handy! I can fit my phone and even my keys (though it looks lumpy).+ The price is absolutely right; these are the highest quality leggings I have been able to find in this price point.Cons:- I wish these had a draw-string at the waist. I am pear shaped; these fall down if I run or exercise heavily in them because the waist is a little too big. THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO WORK OUT IN THESE. I understand that the draw-string would interrupt the smooth line, but I'll be damned if I want to be pulling up my pants every 90 seconds while I'm on the elliptical.- You will have a visible panty line if you don't wear underwear that is \"smoothing/athletic/no-show\".- These are see through after a certain number of washes/wears as the fabric gets thinner. This is typical of leggings in general.- Not really a pro, but if you are looking for compression - look else where. Given that these are stretchy, there is extremely limited compression in these.",
