                "reviewText": "My daughter had bought these and loved them. I tried hers on and decided they were comfortable and cute and ordered some for me.Mine arrived. I tried on the first pair.....they fit nicely. There were some loose strings, but I wasn't overly concerned. I tried on the second pair....they fit nicely. I tried on the third pair, the pink pair, the one I was most interested in because they are my favorite color.......the fit was snug and I could hear the threads breaking as I pulled the shorts up. With broken threads, I knew they would continue to fall apart. The fit wasn't comfortable either. I checked the tags and all were the same size, so it made no sense that the one pair didn't fit the same. It appeared they were not sewn properly, maybe.I asked Amazon if I could just exchange the pink pair, but was told no. All three would have to be returned/exchaged. So I returned all three, and I thought about ordering another set, but then decided not to.I would have given them ONE STAR......but knowing that my daughter's shorts were fine, I didn't feel it was right to give one star. Maybe mine were just a fluke.....or maybe my daughter just got lucky. Who knows.",

                "reviewText": "These shorts are extremely stretchy and comfortable. I got them for playing tennis instead of the standard skirt. Definitely would be suitable for that and other sports, however the silhouette is not very flattering. There is a huge flounce around the hips making you look wider than you are and the crotch is a little tight. I would have kept these just for lounging around the house, however one of the pairs I ordered had a defective seam, so I returned them. Overall: very comfortable, stretchy, fit ok but maybe a little small, fabric feels nice but is thinner. See pictures for the formentioned silhouette.",

I re-ordered another three pack only to be very disappointed by the decrease in quality. The old pair had a lightweight quick drying outer layer with a nice hemmed trim. The new pair has an outer shell made of swimsuit material consistency, which is rough cut with a pair of shoddy scissors, no hem.Also, the waist band is about an inch shorter. I loved the wide waist band for tummy control, and comfort, but the new style has a narrower waist band.Am I going to keep them? Yes, because they are extremely versatility comfortable and great for camping, hiking, yardwork, gym, running, etc.. I\u2019m just sorely disappointed of the lack of quality from my first purchase to my newest purchase.",
