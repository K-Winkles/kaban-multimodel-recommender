I use them for the gym, walking the dog, grocery store, etc. They\u2019re very versatile. I love the zippers. These are at least as good of quality as my Under Armor and North Face joggers that cost over $100/each. My only hesitation is the logo. I personally think it cheapens the pants. It doesn\u2019t look bad, just cheap. Just my honest opinion. I think I would rather it didn\u2019t have the logo. I really like them. They are extremely comfortable, and I plan on ordering another pair in a different color.",
