                "reviewText": "I've purchased maybe 10 pairs of exercise pants off Amazon now, all from different brands, and these are by FAR my favorite.The Waist: The waist comes up high enough to be a true high waist, without coming up so far that it folds. There's a thin elastic band at the top of the waist that honestly I didn't even notice the first time I wore them, and it seriously helps hold these pants up - they're the only pair I have (other than my Yogalicious leggings, purchased from TJMaxx, which also have that thin elastic waist) that I'm not constantly pulling up as I'm walking around.The Length: They're right at that perfect ankle length for me - I'm 5'7 and ordered a medium, and there's no bunching at all at the bottom of the leg.The Feel: Amazing. They're a typical \"workout\" material (as in, not the trendy \"buttery\" feel), so they slide on nicely, hug you just enough to be supportive without making you feel like a stuffed sausage, and are thick enough to hide any pesky cellulite.The Fit: I'm 5'7, ~160lbs, athletic build (hello hips and thighs) and ordered a size M. I'm usually somewhere between a 4-6 in jeans depending on the brand, and for leggings either a S/M depending on the brand, so I'm always nervous when I can't try things on in-store. Thankfully, the M is perfect for me - slightly compressive, no extra fabric bunching behind the knees or at the waist, and extremely comfortable to workout in. If you prefer your pants more compressive, I'd definitely size down.The Rest:-These pants have 2 pockets, and my iPhone X fits in them perfectly with the case on. I'm normally not a pockets-person for gym clothes, but these are wonderfully minimalistic - only two small stitching lines down each side, no extra \"details\" or fuss.-There is a front seam, for all you front-seam haters - but I've yet to find a pair of seamless pants that actually stays up.-The black leopard pattern is beautiful, more subtle than I anticipated (in a good way) - there's a shine to the pattern itself which makes it pop against the black base, rather than having two different colors.-These are 100% squat proof, don't show any sweat, and (so far) have not shown any signs of pilling at the crotch seams as tends to happen. I've been washing them inside out on cold and line drying them, for reference.The only thing that would make these pants more perfect would be if the back seam (the one that cuts across the top of your butt) had a slight V-shape to help enhance the booty - but don't let that stop you from buying these in every color!",

In bootcamp class, we did squats, burpees, jumping jacks, ab work, jump squats, etc. and the pants stayed in place. I love it and will be ordering more. Glad I found these pants. These are my favorite workout pants. A very happy customer and highly recommend. Don't hesitate to buy. These are it!!!",

                "reviewText": "I really like these leggings except for the pockets. The pockets are shallow and they are higher on the hip than other leggings I\u2019ve had.**But I think the reason the pocket feels too high is because it is so shallow. On my other leggings I think the pocket starts in that area but the phone goes down lower so it sits closer to the top of your thigh instead of right on your hip. The bulk of the phone squarely on my hip feels and looks weird. That\u2019s why I returned them.I have an iPhone 12 pro, which is not the giant one, and you can see that it sticks out. (It may look in the photo like I don\u2019t have the phone pushed down all the way but I have the case pushed down as far as it would go.)There\u2019s really no excuse for the pockets to not be deeper.Other than that they are really nice leggings. I love the fit and the length is great for a tall person. I\u2019m 5\u20199 /170 and large fits right.They just need to improve that pocket because I am unlikely to try other leggings by this brand.",
