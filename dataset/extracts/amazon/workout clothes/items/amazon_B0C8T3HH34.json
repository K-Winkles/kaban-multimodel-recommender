I wear a 4x t-shirt comfortably, and a 3x would make me feel like I'm a sausage. I wanted something to hold me together and make sure my belly doesn't say peek a boo. I got 2xl and it goes down to mid thigh and I love it.The other shirt I had from another maker had random stitching where I'm guessing they think your chest/arms/belly outline is and it always irritated me or I would readjust the shirt. This one is smooth and doesn't have any of that. I'm 100% going to buy more. They are pretty smooth and feel great.",
