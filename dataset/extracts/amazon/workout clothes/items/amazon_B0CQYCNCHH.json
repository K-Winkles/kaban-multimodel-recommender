                "reviewText": "The cut and especially the V crossover waist detail of these leggings/pants is very flattering.I'm 5'2\" and 115 lbs and ordered size small. They fit well though I did have to cut the bottom hems roughly an inch and a half to get the right length. So nice not to have to worry about hemming these - you just (carefully) cut them with a pair of scissors.After a tough couple days of working out and feeling tired and sore these boot-cut legging are my go-to. Though these are form fitting they are really comfortable and don't make you feel like you've been stuffed into a sausage casing like some workout legging do. Sounds strange, but they're relaxing to put on.Well-made, straight and neat stitching. Pockets sit on hips at a comfortable spot. Easy care - throw them in washer gentle cycle and dryer at low heat and that's it.If you're a pet owner and you order the black keep a lint remover handy. Made the mistake of sitting on the couch and letting my little monster Chi sit on my lap before heading to the gym and realized once I got there that I was covered in Chi \"glitter.\" These are such a deep black everything shows up on them so be forewarned.Decently priced for a well-made, comfortable and most flattering pair of boot-cut leggings.",

                "reviewText": "I really am loving these yoga pants. First the fit: the crossover belly band is flattering and forgiving for those of us \"fluffier\" individuals, I love the flare at the bottom, giving a much more flattering fit that the \"skinny\" type ankles that give me the silhouette of an ice cream cone \ud83d\ude09.The material is stretchy, but offers good support to keep some of the lumps and bulges on the down low. The best part of these pants is that they have full-sized pockets, I think that manufacturers are starting to understand that women have been deprived of real pockets for so long that when we get actual functioning pockets, it's a halleluiah moment.I've also washed and dried these several times without any pilling or fading, and the $28.99 is a great price for the quality of the pant.",

My only complaint is that the waist of these pants roll down if you don't have a flat stomach. I'm not big in that area but; I do have normal curves and mother organs. Any time I sat or even moved a certain way while doing chores; these rolled down and exposed my belly. I just wear long, oversized shirts with them now. I removed a star for the rolling. Every other aspect was nice quality.",

                "reviewText": "These leggings seem to be pretty good quality. They have a nice feel to them and a lot of stretch. When I first opened them I didn\u2019t think they were going to even get over my thighs, but they stretched and fit over my hips & waist. You can see from the last picture the waist looks pretty small for a large. I would have preferred an XL, but they only had the large available so figured I would try them since I do anticipate losing weight. If I do I expect them to fit better. They are a bit long on me, which doesn\u2019t bother me as I like my pants long. These are fine for me since I won\u2019t really be wearing them out, just to lounge in the house and work out. But with a nice top & shoes they could definitely be worn out & about depending on where you would be going. They are not at all see through which is a big plus and they have pockets. For reference I am 5\u20192\u201d about 175lbs.",

They cross waist is really flattering and lots of great control so they look super on. I'm tall and the length is perfect, I really hate when they're short and that\u2019s not an issue with these and the flare at the bottom is perfect.They seem to be made well, the seams are all straight and there are not loose threads. The material is a decent weight and I don't fine them see through at all. They really hug you nicely but have lots of give so you can easily move and stretch. I think my favorite feature are the pockets. You usually can't get those in yoga pants. I was initially concerned they would look bulky and look funny but you can't even see them. These will be getting lots of wear.",
