                "reviewText": "Great pair of shorts for working out and beautiful look. The only complaint would be that the legs roll up if you have thicker thighs. These are soft to the touch, feminine, and almost look like a tennis skirt. This is not a \"sheer\" fabric, so I don't know why that question would be asked. the shorts are not long, but they are not short shorts. These are a nice, flattering length, not too short and a not too long. I'm 5'8.5\" for reference, so maybe they are longer or shorter at different heights. The item fit true to size. Would definitely buy again, working out in Miami is very hot and these allowed me to walk longer and feel cooler on my workout.",

I\u2019m a rectangle body shape and this is very flattering to my mid drift. I am not gifted in the booty area so the skirt part is very flowy. \ud83d\ude43 so if you do have a big booty I\u2019m pretty sure this will still cover you up just fine (if you\u2019re worried about that).I\u2019d highly recommend it to anyone wanting to switch it up from legging or biking shorts. It feels just like wearing biking shorts but it makes you cute and trendy at the same time.Awesome dupe.",
