However, when wearing the L I feel like I have a serious wedgie lol. For reference I am 5'11 and 211lb. I have a medium butt. If ur about my size I would suggest sizing up if u have an ample butt or if u don't like the idea of a wedgie. They seem well made. Since the net on the side isn't a separate piece I think it will be ok in the wash. I plan to air dry them tho. I think the XL could probably fit some1 up to 235 lbs depending on your build. I certainly plan on buying more colors when I lose about 10 more lbs. I think that will alleviate the wedgie effect. Stop the waiting already and buy them\ud83e\udd28",

They are a little hard to get on though if you don't pay attention. I have noticed that a couple of spots have started to snag on the sides where the holes are. They go really high up on my stomach which can be kind of annoying but I just fold it down and it's usually okay. These aren't the most comfortable leggings but that's okay because they are cute.

I just don\u2019t like the back scrunchie part of the pants it is not comfy for me at all and looks weird. Feels like I\u2019m wearing underwear over my pants that I want to yank.I will keep and wear a long t shirt in the time being.",
