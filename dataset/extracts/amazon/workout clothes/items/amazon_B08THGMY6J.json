                "reviewText": "Folks, this top is perfection. And because I am sooo difficult to fit, my expectations were supremely low when ordered it. I was skeptical but ordered because I desperately needed a support bra-like shirt to wear under a too revealing tennis top. This top EXCEEDED my expectations.First, my measurements for context: BUST 34C; WAIST 29; HIPS 39. HEIGHT 6 feet. WEIGHT 152lbs. LEG INSEAM; 33.5 inches So, my torso is long because of my height.Yet, the MEDIUM is the perfect size to flatter me. It hits 2.5 inches above my belly button/where my rib cage ends in front (most likely would cover an average height person\u2019s belly button) and does NOT ride up during vigorous arm movements straight up and to sides of my body.The beautiful stretch accommodates my broad back (wide lats from weight training) and the fabric is substantive without feeling too thick/heavy. Fits nicely beneath my formerly revealing tennis top. Not bulky.The breast pad inserts are strategically placed and offer terrific support for my C cup. It hugs and shapes me perfectly across the bust w/o creating a uni boob.Not sure if a bigger busted person wouldn\u2019t feel constricted with the M but what I take up in length, you most likely could have extend over the bust.Bought the white - it\u2019s the whitest, bright white with excellent arm pit hems that do not itch, collar that\u2019s not tight, stretchy fabric that doesn\u2019t ride up.It\u2019s perfect. Just bought the black one!Go ahead. You won\u2019t regret it!",

It looks and feels good, and eliminates the need for a bra or sports bra.I use in water sports (ocean paddling) and the gym.The colors are great. The brown is wonderful. The light purple/blue is way fainter than shown in the product photos but it is a very nice color and goes with everything... neutral. I think I've gotten black, brown, and the light purple. I love them all. They are also cute with jeans, shorts, skirts, and can be worn under super low cut tops/dresses, in order to be more modest if that is needed.These are a perfect gift. My young adult daughter likes these that I bought for her after I was super pleased with them for myself.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Review your item very carefully",
                "reviewText": "When I received my item, I thought I had that weird staining others had on the upper chest area. However, it turned out to just be some very, very mild wrinkling of the fabric that stuck until you wetted it a bit. I don't really know how to describe it or how it even happened since the wrinkles were imperceptible to the touch, but the dark lines it left were visible.Anyway, the item I received seemed very nice quality. There is no little logo on it like the pictures show with the white circle and cursive L. The fabric is pleasantly smooth (I don't really understand the \"soft\" description people use for these kinds of fabrics, which I've seen in the reviews \u2014 it's not soft really, just smooth; if you consider this \"soft\" you must be accustomed to some pretty rough fabrics!). The padding inserts are removeable. This is good for anyone who wants to ditch them, or people like me who always remove them before washing separately. I appreciate that there is stitching down the center to keep them separate, and the hole for the insert is reinforced but easy enough to use (I have more expensive clothes with the pad insert hole tearing because it is not reinforced or at least finished for some reason!). The material is comfortable. I can't see the padding under the shirt (not even an outline), but you might be able to on lighter colors like white. I've seen in some pictures that some people had rather harsh outlines of the inner bra's bottom elastic part showing through the top, but that wasn't the case for me. I bought this moreso for casual wear, but I think it would be good enough for at least a mild or moderate workout (depending on how much support you need; I can't speak much on that personally).The main caveat is I urge everyone to carefully review all the seams. The top I got arrived with one arm hole seam already popping. Although it was not completely loose thread/seam (was still very functional), this top being formfitting (and a nightmare to pull off due to the sports bra-esque shelf built in) means that you REALLY do not want broken stitching right out the gate. It will only get worse with time, slowly unravelling every time you stretch the shirt a bit to get it on/off. Agitation during washing would be a problem, and so would drying (if you use a dryer). I try to baby my clothing by air-drying most of it (planned to air dry this too) but the washer would still pose a problem. I have seen some people with pilling issues \u2014 I think you could probably use a fabric shaver with great success on this kind of fabric, and otherwise I'd turn it out while washing to minimize outer pilling.I have ordered a replacement because I really do like the top. If it comes without any quality problems then I will keep it in mind for ordering other colors as well (for now, the coffee brown is quite pretty!). I'd love to look into ivory or white, baby blue, rosemary green or grey olive, black, and maybe wine. Maybe even sunny coral but those light pinks often look bad on me (a shame since I love them!). It's very comfy. Depending on how you're built it might emphasize your armpit fat a bit. It doesn't dig in to make mine any worse, but it does happen to fall right at the line where I naturally keep a bit of fat (the curve between the top of your breast & the front of your armpit). So the fit doesn't emphasize it on me by squeezing it out per se, but the shape (which reveals that I have it in the first place) does draw a little bit of attention to it. I don't really mind this since that's just how I look regardless of the shirt, but others may, especially if it does dig in/squeeze on their anatomy. I would imagine it might chafe a bit if it dug in (I am not too sensitive to chafing though).",
