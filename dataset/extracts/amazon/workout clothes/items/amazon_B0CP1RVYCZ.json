However, my waist measurement is 30\u201d when I am holding my stomach in as much as I possibly can just as I am doing in these photos! So, you can see by the photo that it\u2019s got plenty of stretch for people like me that have a bit of a tummy when we just relax. I bet that the other sizes will have that same stretch.I really like the length of these shorts, and the pleated sides are ADORABLE!The material feels like your basic working out material that they use for clothes which is nice, comfy, and breathable.The colors are lovely and I am enjoying these flattering shorts!I hope that the sizing information and photos helped you in your search so that you can find the best thing for you!\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf1f",

                "reviewText": "These shorts have a bit of a flare to them, kind of like a skort, and that design is not always the most flattering. Since I work out at home, though, I'm not all that concerned about things like that. I choose my shorts based on comfort and functionality. The flare actually allows a bit more breathability, which makes them cooler.When it comes to workout shorts, I'm on the line between a small and a medium (5'2, 120lbs). Usually the small sizes are a bit short for my tastes, but they fit more comfortably on the inside. Mediums are usually a good length for me, and the insides are usually a little loose but wearable. Therefore, I usually choose the medium size.I got a medium in these, and they're really too loose on the inside, but they fit very well around my waist. So if you're thinking about purchasing these but are on the line between two sizes, this is one time that you might want to think about sizing down. Since the waist is elastic, the smaller size will probably stretch enough around the waist to still work. If you're a solid medium, I would stick with this.Bottom line: If you would like a pair of shorts that will keep you cool and are not as concerned about looks, these shorts are worth considering. However, if you're on the line between two sizes, the smaller size will probably fit better.",

The green is a rich jewel tone, the white borders make it pop and the pleated side add a touch of unusual style.They don't fit me as well as I had hoped but it's nothing on the short's fault, it's my body type. They still look quite nice but unlike some of my other shorts that give me a more sleek silhouette, these flared bottoms accentuate my \"roundness\". Oh well...I don't know that I would go for that style again but the color, details and quality are definitely worth owning at least one pair.",

But they're also great for the wearer in that they are lightweight, smooth and comfortable on the waist, a good length, not too tight or too baggy, smooth and soft, and they give plenty of space to move around. The elastic waist is so nice and so comfortable. I use these as sleep shorts/lounge-wear because they are so comfortable! I would absolutely recommend!",
