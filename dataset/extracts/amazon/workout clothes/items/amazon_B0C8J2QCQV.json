The first wash they held up very well and I will update after a few wears and washes how the quality holds up.My initial review: I love them, super comfy, and extremely flattering. The price point is perfect for me, I tend to not want to spend money on clothes for myself. But after losing a bunch of weight over the last year, I needed to. Price for quality is great. They are squat proof. No undies or tattoos show through the material. The material is soft and stretchy. As a mom of three with the \u201cmom pouch\u201d it tucks it away nicely. It does bunch up a little in the front fabric when sitting but I tend to have that issue with a lot of pants/ leggings I own.",

                "reviewText": "These are very comfy, and for me no camel toe. I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d-7\u201d and these are the perfect length. Can\u2019t really see any panty lines either unless you have probably a real thick panty line haha worth the buy, very flattering to the waist. I\u2019m about 160 and I got the L, don\u2019t feel like overly tight nor loose. Seems to fit true to size.",
