                "reviewText": "I don't like shapewear lol. I have worn the ones that are sort of like bike shorts but with more tummy coverage a few times for certain events or outfits and they always pinched and would ride down at the waist, but the shorts would also somehow ride up, I was always super sweaty in them and uncomfortable, they would pinch - it was just an all around bad time. So several years ago, I threw in the towel and just decided I would not deal with it anymore lol. I would wear regular bike shorts under dresses or skirts and otherwise it would be fine.And then I got invited to a fancier event for NYE. And I had a dress to wear already in my closet. But it *needed* shapewear to look how I wanted it to. I went on an Amazon hunt and after many hours of searching and reading reviews - I landed on this one. I got the full body shaper that basically looks like a leotard with shorts lol. I sort of snickered at the idea that I could wear this without a bra - I am a DDD, I didn't even try it without a bra on NYE, just pulled this on right over the bra I was wearing - which worked no problem.The wonderful thing about this shaper is that it actually works how it should. It doesn't ride up or down, it doesn't bunch, it is breathable enough that I don't feel like I am dying - and it smooths everything out and provides protection from chub rub. The shorts are short enough for cocktail dresses - and it is easy enough to pull them shorter if need be and adjust the shaper accordingly. I danced the night away, and drank way too much at the after-after party in this shaper lol. And didn't feel uncomfortable once.Now, the fun part - I decided to try wearing this to go out with the girls a few weekends ago with some jeans and a vest that I have always wanted to wear as a shirt - but never felt I could get away with it with my chest. This shaper *actually* worked with my chest. Was it as supportive as a \"proper\" bra with an underwire? No. Was it more supportive than a bralette? Hell yeah - seriously *so* much better than a bralette. No sagging or weird uni-boob! I loved the amount of support it gave me actually. it looked great with jeans and my vest-as-a-shirt also, but I was so jazzed about how genuinely comfortable I was in it which I never would have actually believed was possible for a bodyshaper.Since then, I have worn it at least 3 other times, to work, or to go out with friends. I've worn it to dinner and had a full meal with no issues, I have sat in the office all day in it and not been uncomfortable. And it gives me such a nice level of support without being restrictive at all. I move around a lot lol - and this doesn't impact me at all. I literally have sometimes forgotten I had it on until I went to use the restroom lol.The only *tiny* thing that I haven't 100% loved about it - is that the bust line is a little high (especially if you are tightening the straps to get as much support as you can lol) so the shaper sometimes would peep out the top of my shirt a bit which I would have liked if it was low enough that didn't happen and so I could get some proper cleavage lol. But overall I adore it and will probably see if there are other necklines by this brand to try out.",

The L/XL fit me comfortably and I did not have a problem wearing the bodysuit at work for the entire day. It was just difficult clipping the crotch because I have thick thighs and butt. The S/M was a little hard to squeeze into, but I did it. So, I recommend ordering your true size for daily wear and size down if you\u2019re wearing the body suit for a night out.",

I wore this during engagement photos under a dress and under jeans and a shirt. It did it's job and held me in. I would recommend sizing up only because this rode up on my hip an when it did it was very constricting over time with discomfort. As with any of these bodysuits I do not think they are healthy to wear often or for long periods of time. That being said it was worth the $ and worked!I also ordered a M in the tan option with shorts bottom. That fit great and was slightly more comfortable than the thong one.",

                "reviewText": "I weigh about 140 lbs, have a fluctuating 29-31 inch waist, a long torso, and the Small/Medium fit me perfectly! It wasn\u2019t too tight to where it was uncomfortable or made me feel like I was being squished.It doesn\u2019t work miracles\u2014 my lower stomach pooch is still visible with it on \u2014but it works well enough to be my go-to shaper.Because the material is so soft, I don\u2019t have to wear a slip under my dresses to avoid bunching, either.Word of warning, though, if you have a smaller bust, like me, it\u2019s definitely going to compress things. Personally, I like that look for myself, so it was a pleasant surprise, but I know it isn\u2019t for everyone.While the compression could hold everything in place for a smaller bust, there still isn\u2019t any lining on the cups, so there needs to be something there so things don\u2019t get pointy.Ultimately, it\u2019s a bit pricier than I normally would pay for a shaper (nearly $40 is a lot of money) but it works well enough that it\u2019s worth the cost. The material feels like it\u2019s built to last, and I haven\u2019t managed to tear it yet, even after wearing it 10+ times.",

Like how tf is my 10lb ham gonna fit in this 5lb bag?! Not to mention I was home alone and was not prepared to have to call EMS to help me escape if and when I got stuck half way into this torture looking device\u2026 however I was committed to reviewing this honestly for my fellow ladies so I headed to my room cell in hand (EMS on speed dial) and stripped down. I did NOT undo the crotch hooks for fear I wouldn\u2019t be able to bend to reach them should I get this on so I stepped into it with the ease of a deer on skates. To my shock that baby stretched to slide up my thighs like a charm. Getting it over my hips was a little more effort but once there it was snug but not uncomfortable. I felt supported. I pulled the straps over each shoulder and tucked my store bought bazzungas into the top half. Now let me tell you, when you have a big top half you don\u2019t go Willy nilly with support but this miraculous contraption held the girls more securely than my hubby the first time he got access to them. I was in! And when I turned to look in the mirror I was shocked to see the hourglass figure this baby enhanced. I\u2019m talking damn girl! So, if you\u2019re on the fence cause your stupid instagram feed keeps baiting you with random fake companies, just do it. It\u2019s the real deal and totally worth it.",

It does suck in the stomach JUUUUST a little bit, it\u2019s pretty comfortable as well just wished it was slightly more compressed around the waist area to give you that proper hourglass lookDon\u2019t get why people are saying that the bra isn\u2019t padded when it\u2019s already stated in the description that\u2019s there is no compression in the padding, just wear a bra ladies \ud83d\ude02",
