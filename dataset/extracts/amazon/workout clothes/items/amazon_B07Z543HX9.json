                "reviewText": "I got the \u201cburgundy/black space dye\u201d tanks in size medium. These tanks have a weird fit, or maybe it\u2019s just that I ordered a medium rather than a small (i\u2019m usually a size small but I didn\u2019t want this tank to be tight at the bottom). It fits me fine for the most part, except for the armholes, which gape A LOT on me. Oddly, (considering how oversized the arm area is,) the shirt is also a little shorter than I\u2019d prefer. I like how it flares out at the bottom (it flatters my pear shape), but I had to remove the tag inside before it looked right.The burgundy tank in size medium measures around 24 inches long in the back, 18.5 inches long in the front (from the center of the collar to the bottom), 18 inches across the bottom of the armholes, and 20 inches wide at the bottom. These tanks don\u2019t have the exact same measurements BTW, so possibly the sizing might vary slightly depending on the color (the black tank is a little longer and 1.5 inches wider at the bottom).I really dislike like how amazon\u2019s logo is at the bottom (it\u2019s way more prominent than on other amazon clothing I have). Also note that the fabric has an \u201cactivewear\u201d sheen (it\u2019s polyester and spandex), but at least that means it\u2019s sweat-wicking and won\u2019t shrink in the wash.What\u2019s weird is I have the \u201cstudio\u201d version of these tanks (the non \u201ctech stretch\u201d kind) in the same size in black and it fits better, even though it seems to be roughly the same size and cut. The only difference I can see is the fabric. The \u201cstudio\u201d version is a rayon blend and doesn't have the \"activewear\" sheen or stretch to it (which IMO makes it nicer and a lot more versatile). I definitely prefer that tank to these, but amazon is always out of the colors that I want in my size. I'll probably end up keeping these, but I'll have to either tie them in the back or fix them with my sewing machine to take care of the gaping armholes.",
