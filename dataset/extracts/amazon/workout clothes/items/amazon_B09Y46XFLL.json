They come in many different colors but the colors match the pictures in person. The waist band is cinching which I love (some may not but I do), and the pants are so breathable. They\u2019re also slightly moisture wicking up until a certain point, so I will say that if you sweat a lot in that area, eventually it will show. I don\u2019t particularly mind it, but I know some people do.",

                "reviewText": "These shorts are super cute! They fit perfect which I thought was odd on some reviews to size up, bc I\u2019m thicker and wider on the bottom half and normally have issues on these things. The material is not what I thought it\u2019d be considering the reviews saying it was compressing, but they\u2019re kind of thin so def can see the line of your \ud83d\udc31. I haven\u2019t tested them on sweat proof but I have a feeling bc they\u2019re so thin that they aren\u2019t so good on that end. I also am disappointed bc I would have bought more just for lounging at home in, but the price went from $23 to $29 within a week of me buying it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the pack with black, green, and gray. The gray have this crescent moon shape in the area right below the butt cheek that almost looks like smile from the Amazon logo. I don't know if it's supposed to give the appearance of a cleft, or lift, or what, but it isn't flattering. It's only really visible on the gray ones as it's a black print. Also, the legs ride up on the thigh easily so thighs may chaffe together when exercising. They are very stretchy and light/thin. But, you can't see through them. They are comfortable and great around the house.",

The shorts were still pretty small, but I like my shorts tighter - I\u2019d definitely recommend going up one size. These shorts are super cute and I love the butt lift lines. The lift lines don\u2019t do much as far as lifting like other workout items do sometimes, but they do give the illusion. The butt lift line is kinda high though, so if you have a bigger butt, the lines might sit high on you. I got the pack I got because I liked the green color, but the black shorts are my least favorite. The black shorts make it hard to see anything and everything just kinda blends in/you look like you have no butt \ud83d\ude02 overall really happy with my purchase, would buy again.",
