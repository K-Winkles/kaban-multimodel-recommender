I was almost out and decided to purchase on Amazon since I couldn\u2019t find it in store and I\u2019m wondering if something changed during production. It doesn\u2019t taste the same and the chili is brighter with a larger particle size than my old one. It doesn\u2019t taste the same being that\u2019s it\u2019s not as hot or flavorful as my old batch. I like this brand as a whole but this particular batch is not my favorite. ",
