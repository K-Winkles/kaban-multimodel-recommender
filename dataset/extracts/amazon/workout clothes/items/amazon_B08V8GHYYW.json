I can zip it up, and it's super stretch so it's not uncomfortable, but it looks unflatteringly tight...like can see bra/and back fat, etc through the zip up, even with a shirt underneath. It's so stretchy, I'm not even sure if sizing up is worth it b/c the material is so thin. Honestly would consider going up two sizes to get a bit of a loser fit, so completely tight to skin look. Very sad, because it's a cute design.",

I\u2019m 5\u2019 8.5\u201d, like 170 lb, and I do lift a weight or two sometimes (I\u2019m not small), but a medium fits so perfect. I was a tiny bit tight when I first put it on but I prefer more fitted than loose, I\u2019m usually between a medium and large in tops. Zipper is holding up so far, and I love the thumb holes. Sleeve length is nice, I usually have my sleeves rolled a little and pushed up anyways. Collar doesn\u2019t stay up or pop up weird like other workout jackets I\u2019ve tried.
