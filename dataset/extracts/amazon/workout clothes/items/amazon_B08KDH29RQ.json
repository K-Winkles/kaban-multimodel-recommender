                "reviewText": "I recently got a pair of FULLSOFT Sweatpants for Women, and let me tell you, they have quickly become my go-to lounge pants. These joggers are the ultimate combination of comfort, style, and functionality.First and foremost, the comfort factor is off the charts. The material is soft, cozy, and feels fantastic against the skin. It's the kind of fabric you want to live in, whether you're lounging around the house, running errands, or even heading to the gym. They strike the perfect balance between lightweight and warm, making them suitable for year-round wear.The fit is just right. They're not too tight or too baggy, and the elastic waistband with a drawstring allows for a customized fit. I also appreciate that they don't bunch up at the ankles, giving them a sleek and stylish appearance.One of the standout features is the pockets. Yes, they have pockets! As someone who always needs a place to stash my phone or keys, this is a game-changer. The pockets are deep enough to securely hold your essentials without feeling bulky.Durability is also a key factor for me, and these sweatpants have held up beautifully through multiple washes. The stitching and seams are well-made, and they maintain their shape and color.Styling these joggers is a breeze. They're versatile enough to pair with a cozy sweater for a relaxed day in or dress up with a stylish top and sneakers for a casual outing. The color options are great, too, allowing you to express your personal style.In summary, FULLSOFT Sweatpants for Women are a fantastic addition to any wardrobe. They tick all the boxes: comfort, style, functionality, and durability. Whether you're relaxing at home, staying active, or running errands, these joggers are an excellent choice. I'm thoroughly impressed and would highly recommend them to anyone in need of comfy and stylish lounge pants.",

They are light weight and soft (not what you traditionally think of as sweatpants so if that\u2019s what you want these aren\u2019t for you).These can easily be dressed up or down and look good no matter what.A lot of reviews said these run small but they didn\u2019t for me.I am 5\u20193\u2019 roughly 175lbs and a medium worked well on me without feeling too tight.I don\u2019t know if these are meant to be baggy because the medium definitely wasn\u2019t but they weren\u2019t really tight either. I guess it\u2019s just preference but then again I don\u2019t have that much of a hurt either so take that into consideration as well.No matter the size you choose BUY THESE PANTS you won\u2019t regret it!",

It makes for baggy joggers b/c there is too much fabric with nowhere to go. Would fit taller girls perfectly. They are super soft and comfy, but also very thin fabric, so if you're looking for any type of warmth, these will not fill that bill.",

They're not a perfect match, but they are nice.The material is like thinner sweatpants, which is very comfortable, with a thin fleece liner. Dog hair does stick to the material though.The inner fleece lining is soft and feels good against the skin. If you don't have bone chilling winds, these are very nice and will keep your on the warmer side during those chilly days.I still prefer my 32degree joggers over these, but primarily due to the outer fabric being dog hair resistant. Outside of that, these are great and comfortable!",
