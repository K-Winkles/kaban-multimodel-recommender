The black color is not the same fit or fabric as the light or dark grey. I ordered all 3 colors in size large. The light grey and dark grey fit and feel great. Soft, stretchy, and slim fit. The black, however, is more rough on the inside against your skin, not as soft on the outside, the legs are longer by almost an inch, and the fit is baggier. Under a scope (see the photos included) you can see the difference in the weave. Customers should know what they're getting.",
