They're true to size so I suggest getting whatever you normally would on leggings. Do they hide cellulite? Stehpanny: I have the black ones and gray camo. I found the camo hides my cellulite. Are they breathable? squat-proof? Teresa: The fabric is light and breathable. They are thick. And no underwear is visible when you squat, Do these cover your bellybutton?

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been trying to find the perfect lulu dupe for me and out of all the leggings I\u2019ve tried these are my favorite. First of all they have a big inside pocket in the tummy high rise section which I love. And the placement of the seams are just what I\u2019m looking for, super flattering. They are buttery smooth and fit wonderfully. They are compression like so if you don\u2019t like it fitting too tight maybe size up. I\u2019m normally a size medium and these are a medium but they are on the tighter side. But they are perfect for working out of everyday life.",

They are thicker but almost indistinguishable in outward appearance. They feel nice to the touch. The waist line is slightly higher. They manufacturer said they have switched from Poly blend to Nylon blend because of feedback, so if you think you're getting Polyester blend don't be surprised, you probably wont.",

They wash well and keep their buttery smooth texture after multiple wears. They look small when they come out of the package but they STRETCH and provide the perfect high waist fit. Sadly the pair I got has no pockets but they\u2019re so wonderful that I hardly even mind! I\u2019ve already ordered a few more colors!!",

But now over the past few months when I have tried to buy new pairs in the black 28 inseam or the black 7/8 leggings they are sending ones made with Nylon instead of the polyester blend. I also double check before ordering that the fabric on the item I select is the polyester blend, not nylon.The nylon fabric isn\u2019t comfortable or soft. It seems to attract all kinds of lint. The nylon fabric blend also sucks if you have thick thighs that rub together when you walk. It feels like the fabric gets caught together and doesn\u2019t glide like the polyester blend fabric does.I\u2019m disappointed they aren\u2019t sending the correct item and at this point I will be looking at other brands of leggings that offer better fabric/fit options.",
