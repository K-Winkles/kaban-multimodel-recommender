                "reviewText": "Man, I love these cameras! I bought 4 of them and I put one on each side of my house. They were so easy to install. It took my husband no time at all to hang them. Setting up the actual camera itself is also super easy. The picture is crystal clear both night and day and the sound is just awesome. I can stand in my driveway and my camera that is mounted at the other end of the house can hear me clearly. It's got awesome sound when you speak to people outside too. I've used them to talk to my husband as well as to call my cats. As a default, they do not record cars passing by or animals that may be walking around your property. However, I do get the occasional notices of each, which I don't mind. I put 128 gb micro SD cards in all of mine. The only thing I would say is make sure to fully charge them, with the USB cord provided, before installing them outside. We installed them on a cloudy winter day, which turned out to be overcast for awhile, after not being charged fully, and we had to take a couple of them down and charge them manually. Since then, we haven't had any problems. I would highly recommend. :-)",

Once you have connected to your camera, you will have allot you can do.

I\u2019ve tried many and for my money, these are the best for my money. While I was away in Mexico, they worked pretty darn good despite the terrible WiFi connection\u2019s in that area. Performance was better than I thought they would despite the spotty WiFi signals.The solar works well thus far and I like the ease of hooking up power locally by using the solar recharging but you may need extensions to make it work. Did I mention, the battery is great. No power cord needed.",

Let's see if it's still the case in winter (I guess you might need to adjust the angle). Infrared mode at night which is probably sufficient. It comes with flood lights and I was hoping it could turn on the lights once it detects motion (my other camera does this) but I haven't figured out how to set this up.-----Okay after having this thing running in the backyard for bout a year I'm back to update my review: it's fncking impressive. With that small solar panel and whatever battery it got, it runs perfectly fine even in winter(we usually get a fnckton of snow here). No issues whatsoever. Would give 10 stars if I could!!!",

                "reviewText": "First, this is my 4th camera from this company. That should speak for itself on how I feel about their cameras. I live on a busy intersection where cars zoom by constantly. Safety from speeding cars and trespassers is always on my mind so any reassurances I can get helps me sleep at night. I have a stalker and this has saved me on numerous occasions. The police have also given me trouble due to false allegations from said stalker and this gives me reassurance that all conversations and interactions are audio and video recorded!Pros:These cameras all operate on the same app which makes them easy to access with a user friendly app.SD memory back up (with cloud options) let\u2019s me pull what I need when I need it. My biggest gripe with competing brands are that they require subscriptions and/or only utilize cloud storage. I don\u2019t want to be connected to any service as I only want the ability to record and be notified when someone steps onto my property. All the other services are just bells and whistles.The ability to talk through the camera and have a spot light to scare off unwanted guests are a cool plus.Insulation was pretty straight forward.Cons:Small gripe but I wish it were a continuous recording instead of just motion detected events. I can of course record if needed by accessing the app. Make me worry if something were to not trigger the sensor I wouldn\u2019t be able to pull back the footage.EDIT:ignore what I say below, I discovered there is a feature to paint the areas you wish to detect motion!!! This was my primary issue and this was clearly thought of when programming. Amazing.The motion detection is imposible to rely on if your using to protect an area by a street. Can\u2019t blame the camera as it does warn you of this when installing but the ability to \u201czone\u201d where to track motion would be amazing and would make this camera above and beyond expectations.",

Daf\u00fcr muss man jedoch die App \"CloudEdge\" installieren. Diese gibt es nur f\u00fcr Android und iOS, Apple Nutzer m\u00fcssen sich hierf\u00fcr ein Benutzerkonto anlegen. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50Gr\u00f6\u00dfe:Die Minikamera ist doch etwas gr\u00f6\u00dfer als erwartet. F\u00fcr zuhause ist sie ok, jedoch nicht als eine versteckte \u00dcberwachung gedacht. \u2b50\u2b50Bild:Die Qualit\u00e4t ist einstellbar und f\u00fcr den Preis sehr gut. F\u00fcr reine \u00dcberwachung ok, aber nichts mit Qualit\u00e4t bei Nacht. In der Beschreibung wurde es zwar ausgeschrieben, aber entt\u00e4uschenderweise bekommt man bei Dunkelheit nur ein schwarzes Bild. Lediglich die Ger\u00e4usche werden aufgezeichnet. Bei ged\u00e4mpftem Licht erkennt man lediglich Silhouetten. Die Bewegungen werden allerdings perfekt angezeigt. Also kein nachziehen oder versetzter Ton. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50Ton:Klar zu h\u00f6ren, auch wenn keine Ger\u00e4uschunterdr\u00fcckung dabei ist. Das kann man bei dem Preis allerdings auch nicht erwarten. Von daher top.\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50Bewegungsmelder:Die Funktion mit dem Bewegungssensor klappt ziemlich gut. Allerdings erkennt er auch Ver\u00e4nderungen in der Umgebung. Bei mir hat er beispielsweise angezeigt, als die Sonne durch die Jalousie herein gestrahlt hat. Ab Start der Bewegung werden 5 Minuten aufgezeichnet. Dabei l\u00e4sst sich auch die Empfinglichkeit der Bewegungserkennung einstellen, daher ToP \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Das Fazit: \u2b50Alles in allem eine ganz gute Kamera (Preis-Leistung), wenn man mal eben irgendeine Kleinigkeit \u00fcberwachen m\u00f6chte. Zum Beispiel einen bestimmten Raum w\u00e4hrend des Urlaubs oder dergleichen. Somit vergebe ich hier nur 4\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50.",

Die Installation an der Wand gestaltete sich sehr leicht.Mit der zugeh\u00f6rigen App ist auch die Ersteinrichtung kein Problem, alles wird schritt f\u00fcr Schritt erkl\u00e4rt. Wichtig ist, dass der Router auf 2,4ghz sendet und nicht 5ghz.Der Bewegungsmeldern funktioniert top und die Bilder sind gut aufgel\u00f6st, man erkennt alles. F\u00fcr meine Zwecke absolut in Ordnung.",
