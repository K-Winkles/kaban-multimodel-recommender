The motion detection works great. It is easy to install and set up. Some say the battery doesn\u2019t last long. I think it depends on your settings and motion zones. I have the sensitivity in the middle and frequency in the middle. I also set my zones so it won\u2019t pick up cars driving by or walkers/bikers on the sidewalk. Doing this my battery would usually last 1-2 months. I have an extra battery I keep charged and it takes just a couple minutes to swap out. I only have two complaints 1. It no longer comes with the drill bit 2. It only came with the wedge plate-I would have preferred the flat plate that it used to come with but it worked.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this ring doorbell to replace my Blink Video doorbell for two reasons having to replace batteries is a pain in the butt and the module always gets disconnected and that is so annoying. I got my Ring doorbell because it was on sale for the holidays so I took advantage of the deal also the batteries are rechargeable and it includes the cable to recharge the batteries no more hassle of buying batteries when your battery dies finally! And another plus no module is required they work completely on their own and I get notifications through my echo show 8 and I can see who is walking up towards my house I get my package alerts which is great I have to pay a monthly subscription but it\u2019s not expensive so I\u2019m not complaining overall super satisfied I\u2019m glad I was able to get it before the sale ended also it was so easy to install and setup a 12 year old could help it wasn\u2019t complicated at all I definitely recommend for anyone who is looking for an affordable video doorbell I remember seeing these a couple of years ago and they were pretty expensive now the price is pretty decent.",

I put a post it note on the back of the unit and poked holes where the doorbell screw holes are and used the post it note as a template. I put the post it note where I wanted the doorbell and simply marked spots on the wall where I had pushed the holes through. I haven't had the bell for long but I'm happy with the resolution and night vision is very clear. The notifications work well and I can see whose been at the front door on the phone app. I have had a package delivered and the bell captured it. The battery takes a few hours to charge initially. I haven't had the bell long enough to make a call on battery life but I will update this post when I've had a few months using the bell.",
