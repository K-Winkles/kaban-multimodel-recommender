Then, I added the batteries to the camera/ doorbell, followed the instructions to set it up, and then came the testing. First push of the button, I waited 7 seconds for my phone to notify me. When I tried to answer the call, the video never connected and I could not even communicate to the ringer. I checked all of my phone settings, and all were correct. After 4 times of trying to make this product work with no success, I deleted the app, pulled out the batteries, and reboxed the unit. Not worth the time and effort, which means I will have to find a subscription if I want a video doorbell in the future.",
