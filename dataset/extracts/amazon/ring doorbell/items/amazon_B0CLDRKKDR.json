This Adhesive Mount Bracket arrived and upon opening it out came SEVERAL pieces of foam. Some smaller pieces had adhesive on one side and one large split rectangle shape did not. Also included in the box was instructions, a small screwdriver, five small screws, and two pieces of 3M double sided adhesive tape. The instructions include both Ring and Blink. However upon following instructions and placing my Ring doorbell inside the case there is a lot of extra room behind it. I stuck foam where I could to make a tight fit. The case itself seems really sturdy. I let the sun warm the outside of my camper up and cleaned the surface really well before applying the bracket. The adhesive is holding up really well. For less than $10 this is a great deal!",

                "reviewText": "I live in an apartment complex, so I can't really drill the original Ring mount into my front door or adjacent walls. This was the next best option. The kit comes with everything you need for mounting a Ring doorbell of nearly any model on your front door. Getting your Ring to fit snugly inside is a different story. The kit comes with a bunch of small foam strips that you can stick to both the interior of the mount, as well as the exterior of your doorbell itself. This is in an effort to make your doorbell fit snugly inside. The instructions aren't great at explaining this portion, nor do they show the correct way to install the foam. I had to use 6 strips of foam to get my Ring doorbell to fit snugly inside. After that, it was as simple as installing the double sided tape and sticking the unit to my front door. One thing that you should definitely determine is where you are mounting the doorbell first. This tape is semi-permanent, so there's really no going back once it is stuck on.",
