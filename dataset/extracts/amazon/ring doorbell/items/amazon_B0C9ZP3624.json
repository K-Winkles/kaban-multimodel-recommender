What is really great about it is that it takes a micro SD card with no requirement for monthly cloud storage like other brands who just want your money every month. Battery life has been great so far even as it's been colder lately. App could use some better integration with Google home and Alexa so I can have my echo as a chime. Also it needs to show an image or video when your doorbell is activated by a visitor. Very good doorbell on a budget or if your tired of monthly fees and poor battery life from that big brand name!",

I've only had it for about 2 weeks, so I can't speak to it's quality, but it seems good. The sound quality seems good, as well, but in playback, it's not always as loud.My biggest gripes are that sometimes it alerts immediately, sometimes it is delayed and doesn't even catch the person; and that any time it rains or it's foggy out, it blurs the view so it doesn't alert anymore. As you can see in the picture, the lens was wet, so the video was blurry and looked foggy when it wasn't. I have to wipe it off every morning.You can't beat the price, and for what you get it's totally worth it. Now I'm looking for a security camera that will also link to the same app and put on the side of the house that the doorbell view doesn't reach.",

                "reviewText": "I recently got this doorbell camera, and I am very pleased with it! The compatibility with Alexa and Google Assistant adds incredible convenience to my daily life, enabling me to activate live view effortlessly. I absolutely love the Voice Changer feature, which disguises the gender and age of the person speaking, ensuring privacy protection during conversations with visitors. It offers various voice options like the original sound, uncle sound, and clown sound, making interactions fun and engaging.The PIR motion detection is top-notch, providing real-time alarm and push notifications upon any triggered motion. It helps maintain security by allowing me to view visitors without opening the door. Customizing the detection area is also convenient, eliminating false alerts and optimizing the video doorbell's battery life.The video quality is excellent, with 1080P HD and a wide 166\u00b0 viewing angle, ensuring crystal-clear images and recordings. The built-in IR lights ensure crisp night vision up to 33ft, providing visibility even in the dark.Installation is a breeze, taking only 5 minutes without complex tools. The CloudEdge app is user-friendly, making it easy to set up and use. I use the same app for my battery powered CCTV cameras in my house as well - a very good app! The doorbell camera is designed with high-quality material and has an IP66 waterproof rating, making it safe to use in all weather conditions throughout the year.Overall, this is an ideal choice for anyone, especially the elderly, children, and individuals living alone. With its fantastic features, I highly recommend it for enhancing security and convenience at your doorstep.",

                "reviewTitle": "Very Disappointing Smart Doorbell",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Arrived well packaged in a sealed box, which was promising.UNBOXING - 5/5After opening and checking contents of box, delighted that everything appeared to be there.Doorbell had all original factory protective films etc still in place.Manual recommends charging 8-10 hours, however when my doorbell arrived it had 80% battery, so was fully charged after 2 hours.Instruction booklet included was very simple to read and follow along with.SETTING UP - 5/5I already had the cloudedge app on my phone for other home security cameras, so it didn't need to follow this step, but the app is readily available on both Google store and Apple Store.After fully charging the device I then went about adding the new camera to Cloudedge. Set up was simple enough as cloudedge guides you through each step. After pressing the reset button on my doorbell and then clicking next on the app, Cloudedge had no problems finding the new device and had connected to it within 15-20 seconds. Job pretty much done.INSTALLATION - 4/5Firstly it is 100% wireless, so no electrical work etc required.Doorbell comes with an adhesive pad that attaches the doorbell to any smooth flat surface, also comes with a plastic doorbell housing which can be screwed to the wall, after which the doorbell can simply be clicked into position.I opted for this option, just for that extra bit of strength for anti theft purposes. Removing the doorbell from the housing unit is simple using the included pin (just like the pins used to remove SIM cards from your phone). I liked this feature as I've had other doorbells that simply pulled in and out of the housing unit, therefore should anyone wish to steal it, it would have been easy. However with this one it is far more secure and wouldn't be easy to remove unless you used the included pins.VIDEO QUALITY - 4/5This doorbell device is 1080p so does provide a clear image, the image isn't the best I've seen, but it's certainly not the worse either. For normal everyday use as a video doorbell then this doorbell ticks the box for quality.Also has Night Vision and does provide a clear enough image, however I also have a security light installed just above my door so when motion detected it switches on and doorbell camera returns to colour mode.SOUND QUALITY - 2/5Was abit disappointed with the loudness of the speaker on the doorbell itself, seems very low, even at 100%. Visitors may struggle to hear you if there is too much noise around them on the outside. Mic quality is pretty good, so no issues when listening in to the camera or hearing the visitor at the door, though I have had better sound quality with substantially cheaper video doorbells.CHIME UNIT - 0/5My chime arrived with a broken button (as seen in pictures), button is permanently in the 'in' position, which means I can't change the chime of the doorbell and I'm stuck to the one option, which whilst annoying, it isn't the end of the world. However that's not the only problem with this chime.A big letdown is the fact that it is battery operated, Many other doorbell manufacturers will provide you with a USB chime, which you simply plug in to a USB plug and then forget it. However this one you will have to keep an eye on your batteries.But the biggest disappointment is the fact that within the space of 2 hours I've had to 'pair' this chime with the doorbell twice already, even though it is only 4 feet away from the doorbell itself on the inside. So the chime not only arrived with a broken button, but also the connectivity between it and the doorbell is extremely unreliable, and what's the point of having a doorbell if it doesn't chime every time when it's pressed.WIFI CONNECTION - 5/5Connectivity between the doorbell and the WiFi has so far not been an issue. Doorbell is able to provide a good stream to your mobile device with very little lagging in between. Perhaps a 1 second delay between the actual event and the video itself, but this is pretty common with many recording devices.OTHER FEATURES - 2/5Motion detection, so unreliable it's almost pointless enabling this feature via the app.Advertised as 'works with Alexa', now when I read this, I expected when the doorbell rang then my Alexa devices would notify me and show me the doorbell as other competitors doorbells would. However this doesn't, now technically it does 'work with Alexa', but you have to ask Alexa to show you the doorbell camera and it will then provide you a live stream, pretty much like a CCTV camera, however if you expect this unit to 'ring through' to your Alexa if doorbell is pushed (as I did) then this device isn't for you, as it won't do it despite allowing the permissions on both Cloudedge and Alexa apps to do so. However it does ring through to your Cloudedge app on you mobile phone.CONCLUSIONInitially after opening the box I was delighted as doorbell seemed heavy and well built, and looked like it was a pretty solid purchase. I was eager to get it charged up, installed and put to daily use. However my enthusiasm was short lived, the door chime, sound quality and 'works with Alexa' features really let it down. And for a smart doorbell, these features are pivotal between what makes it a good purchase or a bad purchase, and for me, I more than likely will be returning this for a refund.",
