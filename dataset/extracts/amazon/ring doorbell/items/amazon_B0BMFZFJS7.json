Easy to add users and their fingerprints.Family loves it!They don't always appreciate all my smart home hobby toys. But they like this one. They like getting in the house quickly, without having to dig for keys or ring the doorbell.We added the optional gateway hub that let's you connect to your Wi-Fi router and unlock remotely. That is handy if you have family or guests arrive and you happen to be out running errands or something.I can imagine it would be great for a rental situation too. Just create temporary pass codes that expire on a certain date. No worries about forgetting to delete it later.",
