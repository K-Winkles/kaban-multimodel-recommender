Other than that I am satisfied with my purchase. I would definitely buy this again. Those 3 issue are in no way deal breakers in my opinion for what the product actually provides.

When I get a delivery, the driver can simply touch the switch so I know he\u2019s there. This clear plastic cover lets him see the switch, and yet protects it from rain and snow. It was simple to mount.It\u2019s quite a lot of money for what you get, though \u2013 not sure it\u2019s really worth $28. A star off for that.",
