Many of the doorbell screws listed have these four sizes of doorbell screws, but not many have the security pins (the pin in the center of the star head). With the pin in the screw, a regular star screwdriver won't work making it more difficult for someone to attempt removal of the video camera in the doorbell. These fit perfectly in the doorbell and work with the security doorbell tool I currently have.",
