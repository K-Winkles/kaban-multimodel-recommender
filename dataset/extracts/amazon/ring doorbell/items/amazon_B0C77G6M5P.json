                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My worries about theft and tampering were put to rest thanks to the durable solution provided with this mounting bracket adapter. This improvement in performance has also put me at ease. As the owner of the Ring Video Doorbell 3, I was happy to find that this mount is designed to fit my device easily and requires no adjustments or modifications. The installation process was really simple. Since I didn't want to go to the trouble of drilling a hole in my back, the fact that this mount doesn't need to be drilled in at all was a huge advantage for me by creating a bracket that allows it to wrap around me properly on the doorbell. This provides a firm grip, discouraging attempts at theft or removal. Even though the weather is very harsh outside, my doorbell can\u2019t come off its mount due to its sturdy design and sturdy materials. This peace of mind is about how durable the mount is and how it protects my investment in the Ring Video Doorbell device itself. Another admirable quality is the mountain\u2019s attention to detail. It maintains the sleek and modern look of the Ring Video Doorbell, which is achieved by integrating seamlessly with the exterior design of my home. The Mount\u2019s aesthetically pleasing design doesn\u2019t come at the expense of performance; Instead, the right balance between form and function achieves the elusive goal of creation.",

It perfectly accommodates the doorbell and the installation is a breeze. It feels secure since the only way to remove the Ring doorbell is by unscrewing the flat bottom panel attached to the door.
