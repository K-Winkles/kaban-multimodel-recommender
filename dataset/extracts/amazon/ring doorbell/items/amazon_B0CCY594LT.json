You'll get 30 days free for saving videos and after that it's $29.99 for the yearly subscription, which I think is fair. The quality is great during the day and at night. The doorbell is loud and can be heard outside, inside, and on your phone. Sound quality is good as well. I already plan on purchasing another one to give as a gift for Christmas. You will have to take it down to charge it, but I've had mine for a month and a half now and haven't had to charge it since I received it. Installation was easy and the camera connected to the wifi very quickly.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this camera and think it's a great deal for the price. Installation was a breeze especially because I already had another camera that uses the same app so it was super easy to add this one. The picture quality is good and it picks up every little movement if you have the motion detection set to high. I also like that it came with the plug in chime so you can hear the doorbell inside the house and not just on your phone. This was a good investment.",

However, it records all day long even if it is off and it creates 1,000 videos, so if I need to check back I have to look through so many video clips.",
