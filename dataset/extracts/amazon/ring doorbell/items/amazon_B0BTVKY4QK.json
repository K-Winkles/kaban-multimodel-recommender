                "reviewText": "I bought this thinking I\u2019d be able to use it to cover a larger hole I have behind my intercom which I plan to replace with a Ring doorbell. But the size of this is about the same as the dimensions of the Ring doorbell plus! So I had to return it.The material is also made of plastic which I think will not really help with the advertised usage for this device, anti theft! It looks flimsy and will make it even susceptible to being pulled easily and make the doorbell even easier to steal.Based on the material and finish I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s worth $50, the retail price when I purchased it.",
