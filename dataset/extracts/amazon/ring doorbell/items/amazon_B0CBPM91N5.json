On a full charge, the doorbell camera's battery should last from one to three months, but this will depend on how often it records. Heavier recording and frequent use of Live View will deplete the battery faster, leading to more frequent recharges. Is there an option to monitor the doorbell camera through a phone app? Certainly, accessing the video is feasible with the Aiwit app. Can this doorbell camera back up recorded videos to the cloud? Videos are saved only with a cloud service subscription, which includes a trial period. Should the service meet your needs, the subscription begins automatically after the trial, but cancellation is within the trial period if you\u2019re dissatisfied. Will this doorbell camera work when connected to a 5GHz Wi-Fi network? Only 2.4G Wi-Fi is compatible with this doorbell camera. Separate your Wi-Fi into 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks with distinct names, and use the 2.4GHz for the camera. Do I have to have an SD card for this video doorbell? The doorbell camera doesn't take SD cards. It saves videos in the cloud.",

                "reviewText": "Considering it\u2019s on the fair side of affordable when it comes to a doorbell camera, the set up was easy and quick following along the given instructions that is. (Listed in instructions is model P8 but not listed in app, listed under N8 I believe) The video quality is relatively good also, clear for the most part and can hear everything so clear. The battery pretty solid also! This is definitely a great first time doorbell camera! That is until you wanted to upgrade later on down the road!",
