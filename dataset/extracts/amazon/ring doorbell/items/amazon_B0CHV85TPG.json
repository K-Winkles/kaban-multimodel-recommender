Night 2 the night video sucks",

The range of view is limited as it only shows what is directly in front of where you placed it and nothing else. The advertisement will leave you with the impression that cloud storage is included with the device to which you can plug it up to a computer to extract the videos and pictures that might have been taken. However, you'll have to pay a small fee each month to maintain the cloud storage that is offered. Overall, the device has only been installed for a few days but I enjoy the extra security it provides.Update on this device: only one person can be longed in at once. My partner and I would both like to have access to the app but once one person logs in, the other is immediately logged out.",
