                "reviewText": "The Auspow Doorbell Transformer 24V 40VA impresses with its decent build quality. The weight of the transformer gives a sense of its robustness. The transformer operates silently even under full load, which is a positive aspect. It remains cool when there is no load, indicating efficient operation. The no-load voltage measures at 27V.For a full-load test, a 12.1 ohms power resistor was used as a load. The terminal AC voltage recorded was 23.2V. This voltage corresponds to an AC current of 1.92A. Despite the heavy load, the transformer operated quietly and remained cool during the brief seconds of the full-load test. This is a good indication that the transformer handled the load comfortably. It should be capable of powering most doorbell cameras, even when accounting for wire loss. However, it\u2019s important to ensure that the doorbell camera can handle a 24V AC voltage. In conclusion, this product has proven to be highly satisfactory for its intended purposes.",
