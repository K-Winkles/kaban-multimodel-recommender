But I really couldn't tell that this was touched at all, so it was totally worth the lower price. Setup was super simple. I connected it to a wired doorbell. It operates the existing chime perfectly. We get alerts when people get near the camera. The picture quality is probably not as good as some other options, but this was a good option for us. It integrates with the Blink Sync module, which works for us.",

                "reviewText": "5 stars so my review gets noticed.The camera quality is just okay. Microphones are pretty good.Camera always misses the actual movement that set it off and starts recording about 4 seconds later. Looks like people appear out of thin air on the camera. Camera will sense movement as people approach the door but only begins recording after they have left, or will appear as though they just materialized out of thin air on the top step.If somebody vandalizes your door or steals a package from you, you will not see it on the camera. It will only start recording after the event has happened that the person is gone, leaving you with dozens of videos of an empty stoop.THIS IS NOT A FREE SERVICE. IF YOU DON'T PAY A SUBSCRIPTION, YOUR CAMERA WILL STOP WORKING. All of their ads say that you can use basic features without a subscription plan- this is not true. Your camera will stop taking videos after 2 months. The subscription is $10/month.Might be a cute camera system to watch your dog on, or chat with your friendly neighbor when you aren't home. However, if you are purchasing this for security reasons: pay the extra dime for a better brand.It is not worth the subscription costs to capture dozens of videos of an empty porch AFTER somebody has swiped your packages and walked away.",

                "reviewText": "I got this doorbell to replace a camera on my back deck. I already replaced my other cameras with the wired blink floodlight cameras and since I pay for unlimited blink and it comes with a warranty for all my blink cameras as long as I am a subscriber it just made sense to replace my back camera also. I figured my front porch blink doorbell does a good job so why not go the cheap route. Unfortunately I didn't realize I needed to get another transformer to power it on my doorbell system until I tried hooking it up to my existing one so until I pick one up tomorrow it's stuck in some mode which gives me limited functions and it's terrible however I already ran all the wire and have everything ready so it will only take 10min to pop new transformer in. These definitely need to be hardwired otherwise they're worthless. That being said so far I'm happy. It covers the area I wanted and has good quality videos.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace a Blink doorbell camera that had stopped detecting movement.I was initially confused with this new camera, as the mounting bracket is significantly different from my older Blink doorbell camera, but otherwise looked identical. At first I could find no way to connect this to my existing mount. However, in the box, under the camera, is a box containing a new mounting bracket. Once I replaced the old mounting bracket with the new one, it installed perfectly.This new camera has a battery compartment door, which significantly increases the protection for the batteries from the elements. Also, the mounting bracket is better designed, and less likely to break - no more thin plastic tabs to break and render your camera useless if you try to remove the camera to replace the batteries.The other thing that changed is the wiring for the doorbell/permanent power. The older mount you connected directly to screw terminals on the mounting bracket. This new version has a connector and wiring nuts to connect to the doorbell wiring - probably more in-line with building or electrical code.Since installing this camera is has worked flawlessly. You have to run through a procedure in the app to have it use permanent power, but once done it is nice not to have to replace expensive lithium AA batteries every couple months.",

While the two-way audio and HD video features are satisfactory, the motion and chime app alerts have proven inconsistent.The option to use it wired or wire-free is convenient, but the overall performance leaves room for improvement.

I wanted this to ring my current indoor chimes in addition to ringing on my phone. I think I followed all the directions but no-go. I assumed that my transformer was the incorrect size and tried a different one with the same results. I was disappointed and decided to return it. Before returning it I decided to experiment with it a bit and ended up discovering that even when using it attached to the doorbell wiring, THE BATTERIES MUST BE INSTALLED. Once the batteries were installed and hooked up to the doorbell wire, it worked great.Additionally, I needed it to be turned toward the center of my porch, so instead of purchasing the wedge, I cut one from wood and made my own. works well.",
