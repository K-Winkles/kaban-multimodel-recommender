I installed directly into my brickmold so I didn't have to worry about using anchors into brick. I used 2 short screws and installed the first bracket, then I placed the second bracket on top and used 2 medium screws to secure it, then the third bracket which I used 2 long screws. All screws go through the slot, and I staggered them. I then painted the brackets to match my brickmold and then installed the Ring doorbell. It works well. My stairs are on the side of the deck, so I needed to angle the doorbell and this made the job easy.",
