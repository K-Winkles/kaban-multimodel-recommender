Absolutely sucks you have to pay for 6 months to year at a time for cloud because a lot of people can't afford that !! There should still be a monthly option. I on the other hand have had aiwit camera, close to 4 years and gave my mother one before I knew the 5g trick below . Batteries last for awhile I keep my censor up so mine last laess but you can also order the batteries and a charger separately so you don't have to leave your cameras down to charge .You can hook 2.4 g devices to 5g only equipment .Call your provider ( mine was spectrum ) and ask for technical support. Tell them you need the hour assistant to hook up 2.4 g devices. Make sure beforehand you download your apps and have them ready. I went through 3 years of different equipment till I got someone who actually knew what they were doing and now after having to buy all new cameras again they are finally working!!",

I also don\u2019t like that the camera can be pulled out of its bracket so easily. OtherwiseIt has very good range and the picture clarity and distance are quite good.; also, the door bell and camera were easy to set up on my phone.Overall , very Good camera for the price.",
