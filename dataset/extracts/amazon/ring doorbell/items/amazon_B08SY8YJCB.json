Instructions are sadly absent so you are left on your own to find meaningful instructions for setup and operation. After days of struggling I finally found a support telephone number and they were efficient and helpful in getting me up and running. The product, now that it's set up properly, exceeds the quality of the Ring doorbell in my opinion. My only real complaint is just the lack of adequate instructions that are made available when you purchase the doorbell. It is also very difficult to find the resources in their so-called support section of the poorly organized and sub-optimal Arlo Secure App. I think the product will work great, and it's probably just a matter of getting used to it over time. Video quality is great, audio quality is so-so. But all features (except maybe the app) seem to be better quality than the Ring from what I have experienced so far",

                "reviewText": "I spent a lengthy amount of time comparing different doorbells and camera systems, and am so glad that I decided to go with Arlo. Setup was easy, connectivity is great, and the batteries last pretty long. I just make sure that I charge them during the day when I at home. Charging takes a couple of hours for me. We have two doorbells - one is wired - and that one of course is nice to not have to charge. The video clarity is amazing. I love the large view that the doorbells and cameras have! The sensors are extremely sensitive, so be sure to adjust the active settings in your app. Arlo works with Alexa devices but not as easy as Ring, but that doesn\u2019t bother be because I use my phone for viewing. The spotlight on the essential camera is brighter than I expected it to be. The biggest plus for me is the fact that the Arlo is a lot smaller and more sleek than Ring. Ring is so clunky in my opinion. I got my Arlo setup on sale - almost 50% off, so the purchase was totally worth it! I was worried about the high price of eventually purchasing a spotlight, but with the great quality of the essential camera, along with an inexpensive solar powered spotlight, the price is much better.",

                "reviewText": "The doorbell works great. The directions that came with the product were poor. I installed Arlo cameras about 6 months ago. The doorbell would not work with the router that came with the cameras. I bought another router for the doorbell. Now I have 2 routers that work correctly with our I phones. I had trouble getting the doorbell to connect with the router. I used Best Buy installers to come out and get it all to work and even they had trouble but were able to make it all function. Arlo has an installation service that they recommend but I did not use them as because it appears to me that you need to sign up for an expensive monthly service to do so. I like Arlo products, but the lack of good consistent direction makes them difficult to deal with. Some of the directions are on their web site with a confusing array of camera models to choose from.",

                "reviewText": "This doorbell is extremely difficult to set up, and their support is abysmal. I'm tech savvy, have used Ring wireless, Ring Elite Wired on PoE, and had no issues in 10 years. Now trying the Arlo because I don't have a Cat 6 drop at my front door and the Arlo has great reviews. I had it running based on sheer luck, but the motion detection was very laggy. It cought all the package delivery guys as they were leaving the front porch. So it starts recording too late. and when using it as a door bell the video was blurry, the audio almost impossible to understand, and it had a lag of 4+ seconds. Then it disconnected from the network. I tried over 20 times to reconnect. Disabled the 5GHz radios on Unify APs to force connecting to 2.4GHz. No luck. Called support. They told me to set up a 2.4GHz Wifi Network. I told them I had done that. So then they remotely connected to the Arlo via the 'Wifi Scan' troubleshooting app. They could see all devices on the network (not cool), and they said I had a 5GHz wifi running (which I didn't the radios were disabled, but they could not see that with their remote diagnostic tool). We got stuck in a loop and I ended the conversation. So then I ordered the Smarthub. And when I tried to connect to that, the app said that camera needed a firmware update and required a wifi connection in 2.4GHz. Very frustrating. So I pulled out a 7 year old ASUS router, reconfigured that to run on 2.4GHz ONLY, and on the 3rd attempt the doorbell was able to connect and update the firmware. Once that was done, I was able to connect to the Arlo Smarhub. By then the battery in the doorbell was down to 62%. I will replace this doorbell as soon as I can get a Cat6 wire to the front door and will go back to a Ring Elite on PoE, or try the Unify doorbell. With Ring I know I get instant recording. Arlo is an inferior product. You won't be able to set it up if can't provide a 2.4GHz ONLY Wifi (so most of the newer consumer mesh routers with dual band won't work, and even if you can disable the 5GHz Arlo support will tell you that the doorbell WILL try to connect to 5G EVEN IF the 5G radio on a dual band access point has been disabled. This does not make sense. The technology is not consumer friendly, it does not record or transmit reliably. Maybe I have a lemon and maybe Arlo will address these issues in the future, but I can't recommend the Essential Wireless Doorbell to anyone at this time.",

No need to ever take it off and charge it which is WONDERFUL! Integrates easliy with Alexa and with my arlo base. Announces on my Alexa speakers that someone is at the door and I also get a a call on my phone.",
