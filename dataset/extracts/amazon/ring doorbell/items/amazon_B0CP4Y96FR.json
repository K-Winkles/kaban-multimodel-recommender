However, the screw/knob to secure it to the back of the door is very large, larger than it has to be and is unsightly. It also protrudes out further than I'd like. Over all a decent product that doesn't require drilling into a steel door. None-the-less, I would purchase it again given the ability to install the Doorbell without having to dill holes.",
