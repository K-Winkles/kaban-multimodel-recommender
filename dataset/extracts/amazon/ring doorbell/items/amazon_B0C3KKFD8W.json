After I received this one from Amazon yesterday afternoon, I immediately set it up with my Ring doorbell (hence the less-than-professional-quality of the installation as you can see from the picture) just so I can find out how long it will take it to recharge it. My Ring dashboard informed me that my doorbell was at 20% capacity at that time. This afternoon, 24 hours later, and to my complete surprise, it\u2019s at 100% capacity! Need I say more? True, Southern California\u2019s August weather may have something to do with it. In any case, I have to take my hat off to this extremely competent Ring doorbell solar charger.",

                "reviewText": "I live in an area that has lots of sunshine nearly every day of the year. My Ring doorbell initially held a charge but eventually it wasn't able to maintain it for long periods, so I thought this would be a great idea. Unfortunately, it didn't charge the Ring. I tried another solar charger, also from Amazon, but it still doesn't hold the charge any longer than it did before, so I continue to remove the battery to recharge it. This worked the same as another similar, but more expensive model, so I can't say it is any worse than others on the market. My husband hated the way this looked, so we took it down.",

                "reviewText": "First, installation was fast and easy and the little wire holder push pin type things make the wire run look incredibly nice. There's also plenty of wire to run the solar panel to a nice location for max sun. I ended up purchasing a gutter clamp since my gutters hang too far over for the panel to receive more than half a days worth of sun and that worked perfectly. However, this does NOT charge your ring doorbell. I don't know what everyone else is talking about but you're connecting the panel to where the ring would be hardwired with the terminals, not at the micro USB charging port. There's even a little tag under the terminal points that says \"24VAC only;\" a solar panel only outputs DC. When I finally installed the panel, my app shows the little green \"charging\" battery symbol with the lightning bolt but, if you look under \"Device Health,\" it says \"hardwired,\" and my battery percentage is still slowly ticking down. Worst part is I can't find a solar panel that utilizes a micro USB small enough to properly fit behind the camera.",
