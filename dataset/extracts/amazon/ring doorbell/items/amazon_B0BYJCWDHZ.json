If the power goes out I can still hear my doorbell AND see who is there. This transformer should work fine if you have a simpler setup too.",

                "reviewText": "I got this because I did not have the common \"C\" wire for my Nest smart thermostat. It provides 24V 0.5A and is a great solution for providing stable constant power to your thermostat. The alternative way was to crawl into the attic and install a new cable myself which is a big hassle or hire someone to do it for a lot of money. So this little transformer provides a cheap solution. My only complaint is that there were no instructions. However, it is very easy to find some guidance online. Overall I recommend this transformer if you want to power your doorbell, camera, or smart thermostat.",
