Other than buying a separate blink mini camera that can serve as a chime, this is the next best thing.It is easy to install, just note that it adds another battery operated dongle to your doorbell. So you need to figure out how to wire it and hold it near the doorbell. I chose to stick it to the inner side of my door frame with a double sided strong wall tape, to avoid people at the door from getting confused between the dongle and the actual bell. The chime does the job and works well.",

It works how its supposed to and i have not had pairing issues but i dont love having to monitor a second electronic outside (dongle hangs from doorbell) and the overall feel of it does not give off a high quality feel. I dont know how long this will last in harsh midwest winters.",
