I decided to roll the dice and go this direction. The product is marked with the RING logo and looked brand new. I charged it over night before installing it using the cord provided with this product. My doorbell is a directly connected to the house wiring but it's been three days and I'm still at 100% charge. My previous battery wouldn't recharge hence the need for a replacement. I definitely recommend this product be given a try. Everything seems to be working great and we use the video frequently and it doesn't seem to have cause a charge issue.",
