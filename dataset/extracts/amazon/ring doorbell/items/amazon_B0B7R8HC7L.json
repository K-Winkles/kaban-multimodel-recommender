                "reviewText": "So easy to set up wireless and battery life last a long time! Clear video pictures even at night. The microphone picks up everything. I stuck it on my front door in-between the screen door because I don't want anyone to steal it! The adhesive is very strong, I even moved it from outside the door to inside the screen and front door and it still stuck on great. I just recharged the battery once it got to 35% and it charged up pretty fast! The first time you have to charge for 18 or more hours before installing. But it really lasts a long time! I feel so much better now that I can see what's going on in the front driveway. You can easily customize the device to suit your needs. You have to purchase cloud service for video playback and backups but it's affordable enough that I got it for 6 months. $30 - $36 I forgot which . I would certainly recommend to anyone looking for a wireless security camera doorbell.",

When away is when I want to see progress at my home and I haven't figured out why it disconnects when away, even though I am on hotspot or wifi is live. That part is quite discouraging and concerning.If I'm home the video isn't necessary. It is when I am away that makes its value valuable. When in use with full sensors activated the battery life is diminished considerably causing recharging daily which was not expected.Set all settings on medium with full human sensor to get 3 to 5 days on full charge.",

The set up is super easy and there's no obligation in subscribing but can't beat paying an entire year for only $29.99. I definitely can say that I purchased a five star product. I appreciate the rechargeable battery function and since having it which has been only 7 days it still has almost a full charge. I honestly don't have any cons to report thus far. But if I do I will surly be back to follow up and update my review.",

                "reviewText": "Recently have been wanting a doorbell/front door camera to monitor who comes around to my house, for security. This was such an affordable and easy to use option. The camera has great quality, the doorbell (if you choose to set it up) is loud and I am able to hear it anywhere in my house, and the camera picks up everything! Set up was extremely easy - just attach to wifi, download an app and use the sticky application to attach it outside. No wires or complicated stuff and the batteries supplied are rechargeable and super durable and long-lasting. I recommend this item for anyone who wants a simple and easy security doorbell camera.",
