                "reviewText": "Listen, this is an awesome Ring doorbell mount for all of the reasons that are obvious:+ Nearly all of us are going to need an angle mount. The Ring Pro 2 comes with a slight angle mount. This one allows you to choose any angle between 30 and 60 degrees. If you need smaller, use the one that came with the device. If you need to go bigger than 60 degrees, this mount isn't for you. I found that the 30 degree angle was perfect for my needs. When I used the lesser angled ring mount, I had to use bright blue plastic shims and it just wasn't attractive.+ Girthy. I really like the way this actually adds bulk to the Ring. I want people to SEE the Ring and know I'm filming. So I count bulk as a huge plus.+ Love the rain protection. My last Ring Pro last 5 years and it looks BEAT UP. So I like this feature. For me, my Ring is plenty high that even if it does clip a slight bit at the top of the image, it is insignificant (see screen capture).+ BUT THE ABSOLUTE BEST FEATURE OF ALL: It allows for various distance between mounting screws. If you mount the Ring directly to your house, you have to have the holes in exactly the right spot. For those of us with brick and stone exteriors, this might just not be possible. We have to drill into the grout lines. On my last installation, I made it work but ended up with a spare hole drilled in my house. THIS MOUNT, allowed me to use my pre-existing doorbell holes. Not only that, but it has a lot of give to move the mount up or down. You can see in my photos, I actually moved the mount up a lot to cover that extra hole I drilled last time. There is a good inch+ of leeway for BOTH screws. So your screws can be closer together or further apart. You can very likely use the holes that your original doorbell used and not have to drill into your masonry. I drilled into mine and it was not easy.I just can not express how happy this made me. I was dreading lining up the screw holes just right. Sure, it's easy to mark with a pencil on wood or siding. Have you tried it on brick or stone though?So yeah. I love this mount. I did not expect to even want to review it. However my original house doorbell was a tiny little thing. My first Ring looked better but it wasn't a professional looking install job. I always wanted to get a wood plaque or something to put behind it to make it look better. I like this mount though. It looks clean and professional. It LOOKS like it's a security camera. It jumps out at you. And the install is clean. I like that the sides of the Ring cover aren't exposed. It's all encompassed in this mount.If you use the wedge that comes with the Ring Pro 2, you see the black wedge, then the Ring and cover sitting on top. Very easy to just pop the faceplate off. I really like the clean look of this one. everything is protected inside this mount. Even looks good with the default silver faceplate.5 Stars. All the way.",

Adjustable angle enabled us to get the perfect view of our front stoop and walkway although our doorbell was installed on the perpendicular door frame. The angle mount piece included in the Ring package did not turn the camera lens enough, but this one can be adjusted and secured easily within its angle range.I like the mini-hood because we do not have a front porch and this part helps keep the rain off. I like that it\u2019s white so it blends with my door trim better.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this for folks who need a different angle for their Ring Pro 2 doorbell than mounted flush or they could get with the Ring branded angle mount kit.",

I prefer this setup over the original item that came with the ring to adjust an angle on the doorbell. It gives the flexibility to angle it as needed. A few things to note, I had trouble fitting one screw to the plate as it was not going in compared to the rest of the screws and the instructions were a bit difficult to follow as there were different lettered bags containing screws that did not fit the labelled screws on the instruction page. You would have to match the picture to the screw from the multiple bags rather than corresponding to the letter on the manual and bag. Overall it was pretty easy to set up and does help my cause in adjustment and not having to wedge the product in my door like other models.",
