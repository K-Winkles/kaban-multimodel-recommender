This smart doorbell camera combines wired and battery power, for a versatile choice suitable for both houses and apartments.

                "reviewText": "I have several Feit LED smart bulbs and love them, so I was thrilled to discover Feit made a video doorbell. Unfortunately, it does not perform as well as I had hoped. Motion sensitivity was inconsistent at best and without smart zones I was plagued with false alarms. The doorbell would alert for a car driving by but not for a person walking up to deliver a package. Adjustments of sensitivity were either picking up everything (including snowflakes) or virtually nothing (including a chubby guy waving his arms 6\u2019 away). Sorry Feit, I really wanted to like this.",
