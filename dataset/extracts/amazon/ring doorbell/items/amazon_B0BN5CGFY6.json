                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This mount makes installing the Blink2 Camera even easier",
                "reviewText": "I wanted a mount which would allow me to articulate the cameras position and then secure it when it was obtaining the specific view I was seeking. This mount achieved those objectives. The small hood over the top of the camera helped to protect it against the elements and it keeps the lens clear of moisture when it rains. This mount holds the camera securely and permits it to be aimed right where you want.I like the thumb wheel for locking the mounts position. You can reposition the base to obtain the angle you are seeking, but make sure to hold the mount attached to the camera up where you plan to mount it, as you may need to rotate the mount base to get the proper mounting angle and also secure the camera where you want it. Make sure the position you mount the base permits you the ability to make the small adjustments necessary to obtain the preferred camera view and angle.The only negative comment I have about this is like many imported items, it comes with cheap mounting screws which are made of soft material. Do yourself a favor and get an assortment of higher quality screws in various sizes to make properly securing the camera bracket even easier.You can probably use the screws which came with it, but you are likely to damage the screw heads when securing them, which means its going to be harder to remove the damaged screws someday. Just buy some quality mounting screws for the surface where you intend to use this and you will be happier.Mounting the Blink2 cameras outside is certainly easier with these mounts than without them. The additional protection of the shroud and hood around the camera are good to protect it from the weather. Just note that the camera will report its temperature through the Blink app to be a little higher than the actual temperature because of the black color and the restricted airflow to the camera. When the camera reports the temperature when using this mount, it's usually about 5 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the actual outside temperature. This doesn't affect the cameras performance or operation, its just not an accurate depiction of the outside temp.This small temperature discrepancy and the cheap mounting screws are the only issues I have noticed with using this mount on the exterior cameras. No doubt that mounting the Blink2 cameras is easier and more secure when using this mount verses without it.",

                "reviewText": "Just as another customer stated in their review: There were 3 equal length screws provided (only 2 are required). One to secure the case together and the other to lock the case at the desired angle and keep it from rotating when the bell is pushed. But the screw length was too short to lock the case into place from rotating. I spoke to Amazon customer service. They will send out a replacement unit. Hopefully, it will come with a longer lock screw to keep the doorbell from rotating.Update: Amazon has sent two replacements. Each time, the screws are too short and the brass nuts break off from the plastic. The only thing secure about this holder is the last picture/video you will have as the thief walks away with your doorbell. It's plastic junk with wrong screws. Going to get a metal doorbell holder.",

                "reviewText": "It is pretty bulky and kind of sticks out. It fits some of the brands of doorbell cams very well from what I see in their description and would make installation easy. It does not work well for a smaller model. It did not look like it was going to work for my Simplisafe model without some additional home made support within this unit. Update: I finally figured out how to rig so that this would work for my Simplisafe doorbell camera and was able to make it work. Sure would be nice if they would offer the needed modifications for specific models rather than just a few.",
