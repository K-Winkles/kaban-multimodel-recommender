The screw that\u2019s used is super small and doesn\u2019t work very well and is easily stripped. I was able to use this tool, the small side to get the screw out that was stripped then use the replacement screws that was given with this kit to use the bigger head and put a new screw into the ring doorbell so that I will not have this issue of stripping the screw when I take it back out again if I need to take the cover off. Highly commend the products for the price",
