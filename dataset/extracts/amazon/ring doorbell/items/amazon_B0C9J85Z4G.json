                "reviewText": "I originally bought a Ring doorbell because I was so sick and tired of the delivery person claiming they had delivered my package, and then my orders would seemingly grow legs and disappear. But, I'd also seen people walk up to people's Ring doorbells and hit them from off their house or the door , knocking the Ring doorbell down and damaging it.So, I looked for a protective cover and this really does a great job. It's very easy to assemble, and all you need to worry about is adjusting it to your preferred height and then recharging the doorbell whenever you need to. I can see how it might be annoying for someone to have to unscrew the case and take the Ring out and charge it, but if you have the settings done right, you shouldn't need to take it down but every couple of months until the next time.Very simple invention and does the trick!",
