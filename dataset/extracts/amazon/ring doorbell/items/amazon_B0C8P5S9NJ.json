                "reviewText": "My door is weird. The size and shape is unlike anything I've ever seen before. It has a pretty stained glass window in the center, so I'm hesitant to replace it. With that said, I was hoping that this doorbell would be mountable to it. It was not. The size and shape are too much even for this doorbell.If I had a normal door, this would have been perfect for it. It holds the Ring doorbell safe and securely with all of the included foam padding. The construction is pretty strong and unless someone is inside of the door, they wouldn't be able to remove the doorbell. Unless they brought a crowbar, but if someone has a crowbar at your door, you have other things to worry about. This even comes with a soft but thick rubber stopper for the back of the screw to prevent scratching your door where the tension knob is.Even though, it didn't fit with my bizarre door, it does do a good job, and after some \"modification\" that the manufacturer would probably frown upon, I did end up mounting it to my door, its just a little questionable. But at the end of the day, so long as it works, and this definitely does.",
