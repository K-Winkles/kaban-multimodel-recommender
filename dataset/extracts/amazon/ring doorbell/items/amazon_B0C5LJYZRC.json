                "reviewText": "I read all of the reviews & was impressed - easy install, good quality camera, etc\u2026.so I bought it!Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t get it to connect to my WiFi - could it be user error? Maybe? Probably? Either way, I emailed customer service, but didn\u2019t get a response. I went to the manufacturer\u2019s website & tried the \u201cchat\u201d option, but was directed to email customer service. So, I emailed customer service again & asked them to call me.In the end, I need the camera immediately, and because I couldn\u2019t connect with anyone from customer service today, I\u2019m shipping it back tomorrow & I have a Blink doorbell arriving tomorrow. Fingers crossed I have better luck.***disclosure - in all fairness, my emails and chat attempt only spanned about a 5 hour window, so maybe if I were more patient, I\u2019d hear from someone within the next day or so, but I really wanted to talk to a human today.",
