                "reviewText": "About a year ago, I purchased a Blink doorbell. It worked OK but it would take 20 or more seconds to access the camera with the phone app. This was a detriment if I needed to communicate with someone on the front porch in a reasonable amount of time. Some folks just up and left because it took me so long to answer on the app. After all this, I decided to pay a little more and invest in a Ring Doorbell 4. I am so glad I did. It was extremely easy to install and there is plenty of hardware included for many installation scenarios. It was easy to set up and, oh my goodness, I can now access the camera with the app in within just a few seconds. The resolution and picture quality is pretty decent as well. Not the best on the market but very good for the price. If you are torn between getting a Blink or a Ring, do yourself a favor and go with the Ring. Keep in mind that each of the Ring doorbell models has different capabilities. Some will not work with a 5Ghz router. This one works with either 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz routers. I have three Ring devices now and am very pleased with all of them. Just in case you are wondering, the Blink did find a home at the back door and is working OK there as a camera and family doorbell. To be fair to Blink, however, there may be better models than the one I purchased so do your research and ask a lot of questions. All I know is that all of my Ring devices work as they should.",

Amazon swears this product has been checked out by everyone except GOD himself but let me tell you this doorbell is a nightmare from hates. First problem, the screws on the back that are supposed to loosen so you can connect the wires from your house to the doorbell, whoever put them on they are unremoveable. You cannot loosen them, not even with an drill, it just stripped the screws they are on there so tight. I could not believe it. You are supposed to charge the batteries to full charge, they have been charging now for almost 12 hours and they are still not charged, how long do they have to charge? If I had not already attached this thing to the outside of my house, which was a mistake, because it was a huge problem for me to put this thing up. I would be returning it. I was not able to connect it to my home because the screws were not able to be loosen, so far the batteries will not charge. NEVER, EVER, AGAIN will I BUY ANYTHING REFURBISHED JUST BECAUSE OF THIS CRAP!! SCREWS ON TOO TIGHT AND BATTERIES THAT WILL NOT CHARGE!!!",
