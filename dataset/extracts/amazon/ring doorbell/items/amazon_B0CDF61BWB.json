Gently is the important word here. Note how it comes out because it likely only goes back on one way. (There is a notch in the new cover (not one of the slots!) that went towards the bottom on my Ring Pro 2.).The comment from the seller that lots of people were able to replace the buttons without dis assembling the unit made me try doing it, and it worked!",

                "reviewText": "There are a lot of mixed reviews on these replacement buttons. I found this one that offered a decent price and free returns if it didn't work. That price is why I dropped it to 4 stars.There is a vide on YouTube about removing the old button. It's not hard but you do have to go slow so you don't damage anything. Getting the old button off required me to clip away the old button plastic to free it up. But again, go slow and you are in good shape.The replacement button snapped right on perfectly and locked in like it should. When you put the physical button back into the doorbell, you have a black screw to hold it in place. That screw does not get tightened all the way. It's also used to make the metal contact to tell the doorbell that someone pushed the button. Tighten it only until the small tab comes through the notch to keep the button from spinning or moving.The sensor works perfectly through the button and the material was not cracked as some prior comments described. I ended up buying a second one just as a backup. Why Ring doesn't offer a replacement button is surprising and they wanted to give me a discount on a new multi-hundred dollar doorbell. This was definitely the way to go.",
