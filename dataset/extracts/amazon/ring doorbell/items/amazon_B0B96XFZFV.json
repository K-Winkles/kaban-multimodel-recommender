It shows they are fully charged so I put them in the ring camera, wait 30 seconds and reattach the bottom of the camera and I still get a notification that battery is low there is no video! Not sure if it\u2019s the base charger or that batteries that aren\u2019t good! I even had the battery plugged directly in with the cord to an outlet to see if that makes a difference and it gave me the same message. I was super excited as I like to be able to just switch out the batteries and go on with my day but I have yet to be able to do that! I though at first it was something I was going wrong so I watched the help video and waited the 30 seconds and it still did the same thing! I am fairly confident it is not operator error! I have not reached out to the seller as of yet but I will and see if there are any tips they can recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This product can charge batteries as well as charge original ring stick up cam batteries. However, these batteries don\u2019t work for the stick up cams themselves. They didn\u2019t work for any of my 3 stick up cams. After putting the batteries in, they were kind of loose and didn\u2019t click like original batteries do after putting them inside the stick up cam. Inside the ring app it would continuously say batteries are too low and need to be replaced immediately. In other words, the batteries were not being detected despite being fully charged to 100%. I was able to charge the Original ring stick up cam battery with the charging station and after putting the ORIGINAL battery back into the cam, the cam detected battery right away and functioned as normal. I struggled to try to make the non-original batteries work for about 1 hour and they were never detected at all, but ring batteries were detected immediately.After a couple weeks I have decided to update my review from 1 star to 5 star because the seller has been very fair with me. They gave me refund without having to return items due to batteries not working for any of my stick up cams, which are only ring devices I have. They also updated their title and description stating the product does NOT work for stick up cams. Therefore, everything is now updated and true and I am a satisfied customer.",
