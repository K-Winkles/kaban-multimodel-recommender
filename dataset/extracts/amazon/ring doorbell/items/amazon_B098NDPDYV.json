                "reviewText": "This item fits the ring video doorbell wired perfectly. It has a great range of angles and was extremely easy to install. All the screws to attach the mount to a wall as well as the doorbell to the mount were included and also an extra screw just in case. The construction is sturdy and high quality materials. Only suggestion would be to add a top hood in order to keep rain off the doorbell.",

Das einzige was ich schade finde ist, das die Halterung f\u00fcr die Ring nicht mit im Paket ist. Diese muss man separat kaufen. Trotzdem keinen Punkt abzug da wir begeistert sind. Montage war sehr einfach.",
