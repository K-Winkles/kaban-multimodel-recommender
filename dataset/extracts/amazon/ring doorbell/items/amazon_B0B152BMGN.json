                "reviewText": "Charged both batteries using a 1Amp charger for 8 hours before putting it in the spotlight camera, within a day one of the battery dropped more than 20%! I have a solar panel to top off the battery and only one of them can maintain the charge. Will be returning these if the charge continues to drop in the next few days.Edit : Contacted support, they sent a pair of replacement. One of the replacement has a misalignment in the USB port and it won't charge at all. I put it in the wired door bell hoping it might charge that way but it's not recognized by the door bell at all. I only needed one replacement anyway. So out of the 4 I got 2 works, 2 heading to the recycle bin. Update to 3 stars for the good support but still not impressed with the quality control.EDIT:I must say this is the best customer support I have ever received on Amazon, they went above and beyond to ensure they backup their product, they send replacements to ensure I got working batteries, very impressed. Now I have working batteries for my cameras!",
