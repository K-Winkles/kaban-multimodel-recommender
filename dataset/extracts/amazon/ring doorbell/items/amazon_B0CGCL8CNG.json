                "reviewText": "This camera has good quality (especially during the day) & really nice range. I didn\u2019t want to pay ring doorbell price & I would say this is worth it. My only dislike is how often I have to charge it. I do have it on my porch front which gets a lot of traffic but I wish regardless it had a longer battery life. However convenient to just pop out & on a charger. Also easy to put together and install & Bluetooth right to my phone & my husbands. Took 5 minutes",
