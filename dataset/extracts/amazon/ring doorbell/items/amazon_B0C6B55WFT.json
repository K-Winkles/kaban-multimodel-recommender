My methodology for Vine Program products is to give a more thorough -- often product-destructive -- review. If I like the product, I buy my own version of it, otherwise, it gets donated post-testing. I also may include my opinion on the product's value proposition to the market.REVIEW:--------------------------------It seems on par with other transformers I've used of this type, seems to function as intended but only time will tell (and I'll update) if it will last for any extended period of it. The wire itself is relatively thin and flexible, so that might be an issue for some depending your intended use, but for the most part I don't see any major red flags with it.END NOTE:--------------------------------And with all the reviews I do, if there's ever a problem with this product, I will edit (if able) to update this review. These will be denoted in an \"UPDATES\" section.",
