I suggest using a straight edge to ensure the mounting bracket does not warp at all.If you do over tighten any of the mounting screws to the wall, then the mount will may warp and the (in this case) Ring Doorbell 3 Plus won't mount flush. This in turn may make inserting the battery a bit tuff or impossible.This mounting bracket is for 4\" siding. It will work 3.5\" but looks a bit sloppy at the bottom but not terrible.",
