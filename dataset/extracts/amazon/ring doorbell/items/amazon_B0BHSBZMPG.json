The bracket is made of steel (appears slightly thicker than 1/16\") and the video doorbell holder out of ABS plastic with metal inserts for the screws. A foam insert and other smaller foam pads were included to accommodate different sized video doorbells to fit snug into enclosure. The bracket will fit doors up to 2-3/8\" thick. Unfortunately, I was unable to use this bracket, as I didn't have the clearance to close my door with the bracket in-place, unless I sanded/planed the existing door or jamb surfaces. Would have liked if the enclosure was also metal. Rated 4 stars.",
