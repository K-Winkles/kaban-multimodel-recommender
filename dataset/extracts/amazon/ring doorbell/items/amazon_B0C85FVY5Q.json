More frequent recordings and regular Live View usage will deplete the battery faster. Is remote access to the doorbell camera available via a smartphone application? Absolutely, you have the capability to view the video via the Aiwit app. Does this doorbell camera let you store videos up in the cloud? Videos are saved only with a cloud service subscription, which includes a trial period. Should the service meet your needs, the subscription begins automatically after the trial, but cancellation is free within the trial period if you\u2019re dissatisfied Can the doorbell camera connect to 5GHz Wi-Fi networks? This doorbell camera is designed for 2.4G Wi-Fi only. Split your Wi-Fi into two - one for 2.4GHz and another for 5GHz. Ensure they're differently named for the camera to connect correctly. Do I need an SD card for the doorbell camera? This doorbell camera doesn't support SD cards. It uses cloud storage, which you can try for free.",

                "reviewText": "Easy installation, sound quality is great along with connectivity. This camera does need to be charged after a while. The battery life is really good depending on the setting you place on the camera. It catches everything so prepare to get a lot of alerts if you live in an apt. Other than that I love my awit door bell camera. Is it affordable and does everything a blink would. You can also share your doorbell feed with someone else. If you have a spouse or children they can also download the app and have access to the doorbell camera as well. I recommend this doorbell for everyone. Instead of drilling my door bell in I used a Velcro stickey to help remove it better when it needs to be charged. The Velcro work just as a screw would, I actually like the Velcro sticky better, easier to maneuver and change the view of the camera as well.",

Issue I have is time lapse from detection to notification even when I\u2019m within 40-100 ft of device and Wi-Fi router. Other then that it does what it should and shows clear and loud. Read a lot about Wi-Fi drop or Bluetooth drop after a while so I will see when I hit 3 months. Paid for subscription since it was fairly inexpensive. Battery life is not bad but definitely not great. I would say about 3 weeks of usage before hitting 20% so I guess\u2026Oh I don\u2019t like that I even when paying for the subscription I can not have access at least on 2 decides. So I can only have the app on my phone and not my tablet in the house and both logged in at the same time\u2026 unless I missed it. But could be a better device but heyAgain it was worth the buy and price was in good budget range for what I needed when I needed it.Oh connecting to Alexa or google would be good too but hey\u2026",
