They actually charge you to get replacements for these tiny little things! Not cool. The other issue is connectivity. Hardwiring is not an option for me, and I have a midcentury bungalow with heavy plaster walls. Despite the chime and internet expanders, it is hit or miss with the connection. I purchased the second ring to replace an inexpensive video doorbell that did not last even 6 months.",

Luckily though we have had zero issues with this refurbished camera it works great, we were very close to getting a regular ring 3 just because it\u2019s much cheaper until I came across these refurbished ones. We have had the camera for a couple of months now and no issues what so ever I can 100% say it works just as good as a brand new one would.",

It\u2019s worked just fine, we recently got the solar panel attachment for it! The clarity on videos are clear both for night and day. The motion activity for it is set up in the settings, there are a few different areas that you can control the sensitivity and the area or zone of the activity. You just gotta mess around in the settings.Due to only being able to add one video I included one that was at night time and a pic from the day time",
