                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve got a couple of ring outdoor cameras so I got this to go with. Battery powered. Install is slightly tricky because of two torx screws that secure the unit to the wall so it can\u2019t get swiped. They give you the screwdriver. You\u2019ll need it to take the battery out for charging, although it lasts pretty long. You get a wide view with this\u2014wider than the ring cameras. You can zoom in on the recording to focus on something but the picture isn\u2019t real great.This is mostly good for seeing what\u2019s going on by the front door. Attached to Wi-Fi works great. Pretty easy to set up. If you\u2019re on a trip and stuff arrived unexpectedly, you can see it and ask someone to get it for you. It also rings a chime if someone is at the door. Good for pretending you\u2019re not at home if you don\u2019t want to deal with it.I think that most porch pirates will avoid places with cameras, but who knows. Brains aren\u2019t the hallmark of that occupation. If I were starting over with security cameras, I\u2019d get this first and maybe supplement later.I went with the ring because the sale price was better than others. They go on sale regularly. I don\u2019t know if it works better, but I\u2019m satisfied.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars These things just work!!",
                "reviewText": "I have good number of cameras, doorbells, and alexa devices all configured and paired together. I bought this doorbell to upgrade my back door. Its definitely came a long way since the first gen. Not to keen on the built in battery but we'll see how that works!!These have a lot of great options and features that really give you good control over your devices with a few major cons that really are hard to overlook and should cost a few stars.Pros. Great alerts, great video quality for just 1080p, range, and night vision. I can have it setup so if my front door gets motion alert, all the flood lights and cameras that can see that area light up and record. You can share with family members and determine what cameras they can see and which they cannot. I.E. we have a bedroom cam for our rottweiler puppy that has a large crate we can see right into during these early training months. I'd rather not having my teenage kids seeing into my bedroom but them getting motion alerts for the doors is awesome.Cons. Local storage is blocked behind a paywall. I literally bought a 512gb microsd card and found out when I couldn't find where to enable that you have to not just pay more than what I was before with one camera, but you have to move up to their most expensive 20 dollar a month plan!!! What... The...heck Ring!??! I'm reading also that even after you do this, you can't use both cloud AND local storage.. This is double dumb and downright either HORRENDOUS design by the developers or just intentional extortion via nickel and diming of their already paying customers.I'm a 25+ year IT professional. In EVERY camera system or data suite you care about, local and cloud storage together IS the bee's knees. It should be available on cloud no matter what in case of fire/ring alarm theft and local storage used for faster replaying of recent events up to the amount of data your SD card can hold.Rather than giving in and paying, I returned the SD card and said screw it. I previously was paying about 3.99 a month for my single ring camera. I got tired of maintaining my local IP camera setup and needing a vm (virtual machine) running to record and eating up storage on my NAS to save it all. I was stoked when I saw the local storage. I dropped over 500 bucks on doorbell cams for back and side doors, flood light cams, and interior cameras to ensure our pets left home are fine and being checked on when we go on longer trips. I was OK moving up to 10 dollars a month for all that I get. Adding another 10 on top for something that costs RING NOTHING for me to use. is unacceptable. This is just a money-grabbing paywall and it needs to stop.Lastly, the biggest operational con besides this is the poor integration with Alexa for scheduling camera functions. I.E. I do like getting driveway alerts via the alexa when motion is detected because its a blind spot inside my house. One window on the back side of the house can see the driveway due to garage location. I set a schedule or snooze it to not give motion alerts if I'm having people over and it completely ignores this schedule and gives endless motion alerts via the alexa devices. Stupid annoying and it seems people have been complaining about this on the forum since 2018.",

We have had some money missing issues and because of this camera it had a wide enough angle to see everything and also when they tried hiding I was able to zoom in really close and get clear picture to see what was going on which was great! They have even used the door bell button to get my attention and ask me things and I am able to respond back which is nice. The motion detection works great as well and at night I can see things clearly as well. Overall great camera, easy to use and all the functions and features work great for our buisness. I have it connected to mobile hotspot instead of wired internet and it still works amazing like if it was on wired internet.",
