This is really annoying because I have no way to see out my front door and i think someone slim could sit on the blocked edge.It seems sturdy. I live in a complex so anyone using tools on my door would be noticed.I both like and dislike that it is a pain in the tookus to get the ring in and out for battery charging. I'm not removing stars for this, but I end up angry with more scratches on the back (and once the slipped screwdriver cut me) every time I try to get the Ring in and out for charging.Overall, I'd buy this one again if I couldn't find any other metal ones that didn't require screws or sticky stuff.",
