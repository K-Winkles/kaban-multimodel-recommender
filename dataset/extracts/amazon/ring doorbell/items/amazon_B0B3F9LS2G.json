                "reviewText": "I have had the original version of this for a little over 2 years, and have now purchased the newer version, which has the same product title, and looks like it is the same product.The newer one has a new AMZN page, but I think they are the same product:Original AMZN page (currently unavailable): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085DVTYHNNew AMZN page: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B3F9LS2GHere are my experiences with the product over the past 2+ years.I have just replaced it with the newer one and don't have enough experience yet to say if it is identical or not.My installation placement was so that it received full sun for several hours. It works pretty good, and kept the Ring doorbell charged for many months in all seasons. I did have problems and had to manually remove and recharge the Ring camera when we had a week or more of clouds and rain--in that case, the Ring battery went to zero after about a week or so.I have replaced the product now because the original one will no longer charge the camera due to the 3 solar panels being totally degraded. Orginal panels are slick and shiny, but 2+ years old panels look like black sandpaper. They no longer produce any power.Overall, for the price it's a good product, even if it has to be replaced every couple of years. That works out to about $25 a year, plus the bother of re-installing the new one, which just went right back where the old one already was -- same mounting holes, screws, size, etc. I put the same old Ring camera back on the new solar charger.If this little solar charger won't work for you, then you probably need a remote solar panel. Look for the ones sold (or similar with the right connector you need) for the Ring Stickup cams. Those are large panels, and can be placed at a distance and are easier to face towards the sun. I have several of those with Stickup Cams, and I've never had to manually recharge those batteries that are connected to the large panels, even during those long cloudy rainy periods.",

                "reviewText": "I am very satisfied with this charger, I get very little sun where my ring is, probably 2-3 morning hours at best during autumn/winter. So far I haven't had to charge my wireless ring a single time ever since I installed this solar charger. I have another ring in my office and have had to charge it once in the same timeframe. On very low sun / cloudy days my charge goes down to 60ish %, and when we have a sunnier morning, it goes up 1-3% daily. It's stayed consistently in the 60-75% charge which is great. I will update my review if anything changes for better or worst during the summer period when it's far too hot outside and probably get a bit more (and stronger) sun time.Installation was a breeze, if you already have a ring wireless installed, the solar panel fits directly over the drilled areas of the ring. If you are buying both together and installing for the first time it's pretty easy to just drill your 4 holes and screw everything on top.",

My battery usage works out to be about 2% a day, and the panel charges about 2% a day. For the summer months, my battery percentage stayed the same. I have noticed a drop-off since the peak of summer, and my usage is now slightly more than the panel produces.The concept of using solar is great, the execution is weak, but acceptable. It works.",
