Initially, I faced power issues with the new doorbell; it would only stay powered on for roughly 30 seconds before shutting down. My research indicated that several other users experienced similar transformer-related issues.My first attempt to address the problem involved purchasing a transformer from a local hardware store, but this didn't resolve the issue. Since purchasing and installation, my G4 Pro Doorbell has been operating seamlessly without any interruptions.",
