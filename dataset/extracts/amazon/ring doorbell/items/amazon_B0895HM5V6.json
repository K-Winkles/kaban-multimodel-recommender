                "reviewText": "Overall, the lock has worked super well for the last year. Installing it was simple, as was hooking it up to the app. (though there are 2 different apps you can use... Next Lock was the one I found worked the best for setting up fingerprints and such)Fingerprint scanner worked, and I was able to set up several fingerprints for me, and for my kids. I didnt ever use the NFC Fobs to unlock since fingerprint was easier than using even wireless keys, but they did work when I tested them.My lock did break unfortunately. A part on the inside broke off and shorted out the motor which unlocks and locks the phone from what I can tell. I reached out to their customer support and they helped me out to get the issue resolved, which I am super grateful for.Overall, these are great, and not nearly as expensive as the other smart locks. (plus they have more features!)",

                "reviewText": "I was so pleased with the first lock that I installed a year-and-a-half ago that I bought another one. This is a follow-up from my first lock review (see below).DOCUMENTED PERFORMANCEAfter more than a year, I can say that the first unit has performed flawlessly. And I am still on the first set of batteries I installed! I only use the lock about once a day, but the result indicates there is no incidental power drain taking place.EASE OF INSTALLATIONThe instructions are a bit sketchy, but having installed one before the actual process itself is super-easy. I strongly advise that you watch one of the many videos on this installation if you are not familiar with such things. Replacing an existing, compatible lock does not take a special skillset, but re-reading the instructions four times will slow you down.TOOLS/PROCEDURESUnlike most companies, they give you plenty of extra screws and parts. You even get a half-decent screw-driver. Obviously if you are installing this in a blank door, you will need tools to cut all of the various holes. If you are replacing an existing lock, you will likely need to drill one hole. A quality drill bit is included! All the holes are easily lined up with an included template.COMPLAINTSI suspect that 95% of the complaints that the lock did not work properly after installing are due to failure to identify the door as being either right or left handed, and setting the controls accordingly (see comment below).I haven't gotten into any programming other than setting up passcodes. I can, however, see that the programming directions are quite confusing. This is a complaint others have voiced. Again, I would defer to videos or explanations on various websites. It's a lock, and supported by many installers.=============FIRST LOCK REVIEWThis lock has performed flawlessly, on the same batteries I might add, for 15 months. Never fails to open with the keypad, or with BlueTooth. The BlueTooth works better than advertised--at least 50 yards away. This unit is installed under a small porch roof, with minimal exposure to weather other than in a heavy blow.Simple to install. Direct replacement for standard deadbolt setup. MAKE SURE YOU PERFORM BOTH STEPS TO SET IT UP FOR EITHER RIGHT OR LEFT HAND DOOR! 1) Move internal switch to proper position. 2) Turn knob to the orientation they specify BEFORE you start installing.This is an attractive and well-built unit. I expect the mechanical parts to function for my lifetime. The life of the electronics are anyone's guess. However, with the quality I see built into the mechanics, I doubt they would skimp on the electronics. After having done much research on this unit, I am extremely pleased with the result.",

Luckily I looked into the warranty and it was still warranted. I reached out to the user on Amazon and within a day they reached out to me. I spoke with Elaine from Smonet Smart Lock Tech support and through text she walked me through the process. We did some reseting on my end and on their end. Unfortunately, it still did not work. Elaine was able to send me a new device. She reached out to me via text to let me know that she mailed out a new lock. Within in a week I had my device. She followed up to make sure the new device was programmed and functional. I have to say for being in completely different time zones she had one of the best communication skills. Very prompt and her follow up was on point. Very satisfied with her and the companies customer service. I highly recommend this device and guarantee you will have someone on the other side for any trouble shooting issues. Thank you!",

However, there are a few things I noticed with this smart lock.This smart lock boasts bluetooth capability and I had thought it would use bluetooth proximity from my phone to lock/unlock, but it can't. For example if I got home and walked to the door with my phone in my pocket, the smart lock would unlock. However, this lock does not have that feature.In addition, the material the touchpad is made of will make it very evident of what buttons are being pressed over time. So you will need to either clean the touchpad every once in a while or change your passcode to use other numbers, for security purposes.Lastly the keys that come with the smart lock look and feel very cheap.",

The Auto-lock feature is quite useful. The automatic record of locking/unlocking (but only when that's done with the app) is a bonus. The remote locking would be useful, but requires a Gateway, which is a separate purchase. The best feature (when it works) is being able to give someone an eKey or Passcode for a set date and time period (so a tenant's access automatically expires at the end of their tenancy period), or one-time only, or on a recurring basis.The key (no pun intended) phrase here is \"when it works\". After nearly a month's use, the biggest problem is the software, which has confusing interface issues, and curious glitches. For some reason, the lock/unlock settings have reversed. (The FAQ acknowledges this problem, and suggests a fix by switching a toggle \"on the back panel\", which we have no idea what that means, as it is not shown in the diagram.) Also, it is unclear what is the difference (or the relationship) between \"Passcodes\" and \"eKeys\", and setting someone up with either only for worked for two of us\u2014the other two are having to use the physical key. The good news is that the physical keys cannot be duplicated.Bottom line: if the software glitches and interface were to be fixed, this lock would rate a full five stars.

You can also use the keypads to lock/lock . The third type is using the app to lock/unlock. You can even control the lock using Bluetooth.The most interesting part is the remote unlock/ lock. Add a gateway and link the lock to the wifi.The admin can generate one type password for visitors .If you often forget to lock the door, you can set automatic unlock.Another interesting part is you can link your smart watch to the lock.This is as very advanced smart lock and discovering all these functions makes me feel fascinated and high tech. Not only a fancy product but also enables easier locking of doors .If you don't like carrying keys , this way you can reduce the amount of keys and yet have the benefit of deadlocks.
