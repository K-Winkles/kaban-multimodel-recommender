Absolutely, you have the capability to view the video via the Aiwit app. Does this doorbell camera let you store videos up in the cloud? Videos are saved only with a cloud service subscription, which includes a trial period. Should the service meet your needs, the subscription begins automatically after the trial, but cancellation is free within the trial period if you\u2019re dissatisfied Can the doorbell camera connect to 5GHz Wi-Fi networks? This doorbell camera is designed for 2.4G Wi-Fi only. Split your Wi-Fi into two - one for 2.4GHz and another for 5GHz. Ensure they're differently named for the camera to connect correctly. Do I need an SD card for the doorbell camera? This doorbell camera doesn't support SD cards. It uses cloud storage, which you can try for free.",

The included chime is a bonus and it pairs easily with the bell. Quality of video is good both in day and night. Tried the 2 way audio communication and no complaints with it so far. I find the product a very good addition especially for the price and features it provides.Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "So I'll edit my review if anything new pops up that didn't present as a problem initially.Let's start with setup ... Quick and easy. So easy, that I was half awake and struggling to read after a long day and still managed to get into connected just fine.As far as the doorbell portion goes, I can't speak to that. We have a built in doorbell already (we rent) so I didn't see a need to plug in a second one. BUT while testing it last night, if the doorbell is rang it will ring on your phone, and you have a timer to \"answer\". If you \"pick up\" it connects you to the camera so you can see who's there, and you can communicate via the microphone button at the bottom.Night vision - works surprisingly well for the price we paid. I really wasn't expecting super high quality, but this surpassed what I was expecting. Night vision is extremely clear.The microphone on it sounds like crap tbh. But again, look at the price point. It's only the sound that comes out of the doorbell. The sound it picks up is clear.Pretty wide range picture. You can play with the sensitivity in the settings, which will essentially effect how close/far away something needs to be to trigger the motion sensor. I've got it set on \"standard\" and it picks up motion from the middle of our driveway.The subscription itself is cheap in my opinion. It's about the same cost as the camera, for 6 months. It records at the first motion detection, and will stop recording when the motion stops.You have the ability to look at the camera any time from the app, which also tells you the battery level.The only negatives I see in this so far that may deter someone from buying it, is the fact it needs to be charged. Obviously since it's not hard wired it needs to get it's energy from somewhere, but you'd think the company would offer changeable battery packs (so you can charge and swap). Also there's somewhat of a lag in recording. When we were testing it, his movements vs what I was seeing were a second or two behind, but to me that's not the end of the world.For the price point it's an excellent choice. I got way more than I expected.I also want to note (it may be mentioned in the ad somewhere but I'm known for half reading that) this does NOT come with screws to mount it. It does however come with a sticky pad (like double sided mounting tape).",
