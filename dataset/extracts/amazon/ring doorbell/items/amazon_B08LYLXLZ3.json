They explained to me the issues mentioned below with how the listing states the purchased part is compatible with my device even if it is not. They sent out the correct wedge kit and it fits perfectly. Thank you for the great support Link!I bought this kit specifically because Amazon stated it would fit the device I had just purchased. This need to be fixed because the listing is misleading. It is far too small for the Ring doorbell I purchased. I now need to return this priduct and find another way to angle my doorbell down.",

On this doorbell, the second gen, it took two of the three wedges to make it straight up and down.It came with multiple size screws to work with one, two, or three wedges. Very easy to install and uninstall when we determined just one wedge was not enough. My previous Ring Doorbell came with a wedge, this one did not so when it comes to value, I put ok as I really do not think it should have been a separate purchase, but that is just my opinion.Would buy again if needed, and would suggest to someone needing a wedge for a second generation wedge.",

                "reviewText": "Update; after writing this review, was contacted Ring. After listening to my tail of woa, and validing that I actually had an account she went ahead and sent me replacements of the correct wedge needed. So I've got folks a hi-five for customer service and support. New wedges came in next day (surprise-surprise) and they are now installed and working great! I also mentioned that the screws supplied are perhaps not the best for the wedges unless a small washer is also used. With the tapered head on the screw, it's more designed for flush mounting in woood. As it is, it is all too easy to tighten the screw right through the slot in the wedge. Likewise, it would also be very easy for someone to yank the doorbell off of whatever it's attached to. So, bump the rating to 3 stars, still, don't trust Amazon 100% for ordering stuff but loved the customer attention from Ring.",
