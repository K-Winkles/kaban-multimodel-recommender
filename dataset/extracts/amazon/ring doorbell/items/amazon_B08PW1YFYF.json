Despite being refurbished, it functions flawlessly and provides reliable protection for my home. The setup process was straightforward, and the optional 24/7 professional monitoring adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind.The only drawback I encountered was the requirement to register the alarm with my county police and fire departments for them to respond to alerts. While this process was a bit inconvenient, it's a necessary step for ensuring the effectiveness of emergency response services. that's also additional cost every month on top of the additional fees for the subscription for the ring systemOverall, I'm highly impressed with the Ring Alarm system and would recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable home security solution.\"",

This model is even easier to install than the old one, which was also pretty easy. You can't go wrong with Ring hardware or service.",
