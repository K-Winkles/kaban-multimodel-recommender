I live in a rural area and I was worried that a doorbell camera wouldn't give me a good view of the area. I am amazed at how large an area is covered by the camera. I'm also pleased with how well the audio works. The only thing that could be improved would be to have more documentation on how to use the app.",

Also when I bought it I was curious about how much the subscription was and I couldn't find an answer. It's 29.99 for a year. Not too bad. The pictures are clear the video is great. I have no complaints so far.",
