The battery will last for 3 months and with a super charger you will not miss porch pirates or deliveries. Make sure you set it up in the right place on your door ( not too low or too high). It's great for our safety and peace of mind. I recommend this hassle free doorbell camera.The camera was in great shape when I got it. Instillation was easy. The picture is great, it motion detects just fine on a low setting. Its been less than a week since I have put it up. I will get you more of a review once it has passed 30 days and then again in 6 months. Glad I purchased this item as my last doorbell stopped working after 3 years. At this point I would recommend to others.",

It took a few days to get used to the settings and review the pictures. The calendar feature is nice to review on the days you skipped by. Once you need to see a live picture/video it is easy and the pictures are clear. Excellent value over the \"big\" brand. The remote bell is an easy set up and you can put it anywhere you like is a nice feature.",

After she tried for hours resetting the device, deleting the app, resetting my router, going through the AP network, and trying to reach out to customer service, the camera still didn't work. I gave up, and hope customer service will reach out to me for a solution or new device. I will update my review if they do.",

Recently, it doesn't alert me when there is movement and there have been several occasions when I've had packages delivered and I never got an alert.

                "reviewText": "Very hard to set up app. It kept saying I needed to be connected to WiFi 2 not the 5. I tried several times. Then it said camera was too far away from router. Then it would tell me to change my wpa settings on my router. I couldn\u2019t figure out how to do that. Told me also to power off and restart router. Tried that. Finally I created an account for the app on my desktop and uninstalled then reinstalled the app that I was trying to connect to for the camera. Signed in no problem and when connecting to WiFi it brings up a hidden WiFi (maybe the cameras own?) no clue but I had at connect to that hidden one. I am using my camera more as a security camera than a doorbell. As you can see in pic I place it facing my front door. It also catches a glimpse of my neighbors door. Being as I have a sunporch I didn\u2019t want to face it toward the road as my house is like 40 feet from the road and the motion of the cars would kill the battery very fast. The camera gets placed in a holder than you can slide it out to recharge the battery when needed. It did not come with a micro sim but I had one from my last camera that stopped working after a couple years. Not sure what the SIM card does as every day nothing is saved to it. I did not pay for any service they offer. Maybe I\u2019d I did it would save clips? I just like the fact that I can keep an eye on my front door when I\u2019m not at home and also when it detects motion I get notification. Also sometimes I\u2019ll get to work and wonder if I shut my front door because I go in and out of the house a couple times before driving away. I have left my door open before but thankfully the sunporch I guess distracts intruders. I say this camera is worth the $53 dollars to have a piece of mind. You can easily move it anywhere if needed. It will stand up on a window sill or even a dresser if you have elders or children to keep an eye on. The picture quality is great! Same with the motion detection. Delivered next day too. I do recommend this camera.",

The setup even gave feedback on the WiFi signal to help choose the best location for the doorbell.The picture quality is excellent, even at night. In fact it is so good I haven't bothered with HD at the moment, just left it at SD.Pairing with the supplied wireless chime was quick and easy, just press the pairing button on the chime and then ring the doorbell.The application works well and has good functionality for live view and alerts. It also makes it easy to share the doorbell with other family members.I can't comment on the battery life yet and will try to update the review once it needs recharging.All in all I'm very happy with my purchase so far.",

I chose this one for the price and the fact I can store data to an sd card as I don't want to pay for monthly storage. This works well, in fact if anything it is overly sensitive. I have had to turn the motion sensor to the lowest settings as it sends far too many notifications. I live in a sleepy village so dread to think how it would be in a busy city area. Picture quality is good, I'm sure there's better out there but it does what I require and was a very reasonable price with no hidden extra charges. It also comes with an indoor chime which is a bonus. It's easy to set up and on low settings the battery life seems really good.",

All coverage is stored locally and you can access via the easy to use app. Excellent item and I\u2019m really happy with it.",
