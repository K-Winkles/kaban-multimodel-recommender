                "reviewText": "I used to think I could never have a Ring video doorbell living in an apartment complex because I would have to drill screws into the wall next to my door and I don\u2019t think the landlord would allow that. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted something that uses adhesive because it could easily be stolen. I didn\u2019t know how to install the Ring video doorbell that works through a peephole and would have had to pay someone to do it. But now they have a zillion different products like this one that allows you to easily mount a Ring (or other brand) video doorbell without making any alterations to your apartment. This one is made of thick plastic and I feel confident that it will deter anyone from stealing my video doorbell. It can only be removed from the inside of your door and the screw holding the mount together is on the back, so it has to be removed before you can access the video doorbell. My brother ended up buying the same product for his new Ring video doorbell when I told him about it, since he rents a house and can\u2019t make alterations either. I did have a little difficulty figuring out how to put it together properly, but eventually I figured it out. I\u2019m guessing there are probably tons of videos showing you how to put it together, but I\u2019m just stubborn and prefer to figure everything out for myself. I\u2019m grateful that someone came up with the idea for something like this. It\u2019s also nice because I can adjust the height as much as I want (though Ring suggests installing it 4 feet high). Hope this review helps someone who is wondering if these things work so they can have a Ring for their apartment.",
