                "reviewText": "Whether I\u2019m at home, at work or on vacation, I am always thinking about safety. After retiring from a 26 year law enforcement career, I can say that I have seen a lot of innocent people become victims of crimes, with many of those crimes being preventable. I have a Ring doorbell camera permanently mounted onto my front door, and was going to add another Ring doorbell to my back door with the same screw-in permanent mount, until I saw this product. I really like that it does not require any holes. What I also like is that I can take this mount, along with a Ring doorbell and use it at the beach house that we rent every year. There\u2019s no reason to let my guard down just because I\u2019m on vacation.This is a well designed and made product and it should last for several years. Installing it was super easy. The mount does not leave any marks on the door.",
