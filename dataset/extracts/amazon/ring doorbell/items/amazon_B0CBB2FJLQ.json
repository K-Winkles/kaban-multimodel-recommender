One way to preserve the battery life is by adjusting the motion sensitivity. Ring cam will alert you for passing cars, but after you adjust it you'll be only alerted when someone actually walks up to the door.",

            "\u26a1 The battery life depends on how many motion events the doorbell captures, so the lifespan will vary from home to home. The more events, the quicker the battery will deplete. You can fine tune the doorbell's capture settings in the Ring app to help extend the battery life.",

The upgraded battery power control system is able to offer camera longer working time, making house surroundings safer under surveillance."

                "reviewText": "These batteries are constantly not being detected by my Ring cameras. I have a system of 4. They take turns randomly saying that there is no battery or the battery status is unknown. Its not - it is working. The batteries seem to work well after about 2 weeks in terms of battery life, but not being detected means not being able to use all the camera features in the Ring app. That includes live view being disabled. My app will be clueless how the camera has power but when it detects motion, it still records. For reference, 3 cameras are on solar panels and 1 is on AC power. All 4 still have this issue. This is the second generic Ring battery brand I have tried. At this point, next time I am buying official. Official batteries do not cause any issues. The little problems these generic ones cause in the app are too annoying.Update: All of my cameras using this generic battery show offline but those using genuine batteries are fine. There are no network issues or problems with the app. These batteries are just a fraud. Its been just more than 30 days since purchase but I will be demanding my money back.",
