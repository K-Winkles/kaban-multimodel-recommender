Great product.I can\u2019t say enough about Ring, it\u2019s in my opinion the product leader.One thing about Ring, without the prescription it\u2019s only use is real time and depending on your wireless connection speed or cell/computer you could miss the person at you door, outside your home in any area, or inside. In my opinion it\u2019s a must to buy the yearly (cheaper if you pay the one time yearly prescription cost) prescription. With this you can go back in time to view and the videos can be saved up to ~180 days.I\u2019ve used video for insurance and we\u2019ve had some fun when accidental falls or other fun times being caught on video (partying essentially). Thankfully I have not needed Ring for any thieves, I believe having Ring cameras in and around your home is at times deterrent enough.",

Black dots only appeared when looking at a red curb. If something else was in front of the red curb, everything was fine. Red curb looked like a dotted / dashed red line with black holes in it. All of a sudden it appeared on Day 28. Called Ring customer service, went through all these resets, then it went offline and took about 12 tries to restore it. But black specks remained. Ring said send it back to Amazon being it\u2019s within 30 days. For $180 what a joke.",

                "reviewText": "I tried this on a whim as I'm already pretty deeply invested in the Ring ecosystem with at least 7 other wired Ring cameras. I wanted to see if I could use this as a trail cam about 100 yards from my house. Shockingly, it's working great at that distance. I had to ensure it was mounted so the tree it's on isn't directly in the line of sight between the camera and the WiFi AP in my living room, but once I did that it has been working flawlessly. RSSI sits at about -67 Additionally, I got this with the solar panel so I wouldn't have to charge it frequently and have been surprised at the effectiveness of the solar panel. I even have notifications set to frequent and highest sensitivity (against recommendations when running on battery). I was essentially just testing it in the location I placed the camera, so I just sat the solar panel on the ground next to the tree the camera is mounted on. It's actually under some brush (leaves are gone this time of year) and it's not really even pointing south, and yet, with this poor site selection for solar it has been maintaining the battery between 68 & 90% for weeks now during mostly overcast Michigan fall weather. I'm going to test in a few more locations and if it works in those, I plan to get an additional 2-pack of these. Recommended for those that need a wireless Ring cam and don't want to charge the battery regularly.",

                "reviewTitle": "2.0 out of 5 stars Mostly great, but ceiling mounting give upside down video",
                "reviewText": "Setup is fairly easy, except the QR code is too tiny to be read by the Ring app so one has to manually enter in the PIN. Once done the rest of the setup is easy, and the product works pretty well. Motion detection is good and video quality is decent enough.But the ceiling mount is ludicrous. With the Stick Up cams, there is no way to invert the video, so when installed as directed you get an upside down image. It is annoying that Ring (i.e. Amazon) says the unit can be ceiling mounted, and there is even a section on that in the installation instructions. But if you follow the instruction, you\u2019ll be looking at upside down images with no way to correct. Only after install did I find this out, as it is NOT mentioned anywhere in the description. Searching the Ring support archives, you\u2019ll find a long thread going back several years on this, and Ring has still yet to correct this which is absurd - it would only take a simple software change to enable, and ironically this feature is available on older and cheaper indoor Ring cameras.It is unacceptable that Ring continues to advertise this camera as capable of ceiling mount, only to find that feature unusable. Fix it, Ring!!!!!",
