I didn\u2019t realize until it was already delivered and i tried to install it, as you can see in the video, my door won\u2019t close completely and it won\u2019t lock at all so i cannot use it. I was frustrated so i went back to the product page and realized it says \u201ccan only be used with inward swinging door\u201d It\u2019s my fault for not reading everything and just impulsively purchasing but I want to save anyone else the hassle and waste of money.",

The mesh is sturdy thick metal but much thinner than a door is, even at the framing, where the gate is the thickest. Aside from that, the molding on the doorway was too close for this item so i had to Dremel off a small portion and completely remove the metal hook, which is a security feature on the item to make room. I also needed to purchase a piece of wood to mimic the door thickness on the gate. All that being done, the item seems to be working great and just barely fits an Arlo doorbell but it fits and it works.",

                "reviewText": "Got the right mount because it fit my Zumimall doorbell. Has different sized foam inserts that need to be placed around the doorbell In the mount. In my case, I only needed the side mounts as the top and bottom spaces of my doorbell were too tight to squeeze anything into those places. I have no issues whatsoever with opening or closing the door. I definitely, would suggest buying this to my friends, neighbors, and family. It's big but I think it looks great and I feel like it protects my doorbell from being stolen.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Doorbell Boa because I wanted to patronize the original product but man their customer service sucks when it comes to replacement. I purchased the product on March 14, 2022 from Amazon and the product was delivered quickly.3 Months after using the doorbell boa, a first incident happened: a homeless person tried to yank my Doorbell Boa from my business door but was unsuccessful in removing it. However he was able to bend the case enough to face outward to the right. I tried to bend the metal casing back to shape hoping that they won\u2019t attempt to try again next day and hoping i can contact doorbell boa's customer service about it on the first business day (Monday). I put the case back with the bottom going under the door handrail so that the person will have a hard time prying it out of the door because the handrail is against it so it will make it harder to take out. But on the following day after the first incident (Sunday morning) another homeless person was finally able to yank it out using a crow bar and took out my Ring video doorbell, all while i watch and scream at him while he\u2019s doing it. I did report him to the police and he got caught about an hour later. The next day (Monday), I reported it to the first customer service and I was told to contact another company to report the incident and process a replacement. I immediately emailed the company as instructed and got an answer back same day. That was June 13th. The email then asked me to send the shipping address to which I immediately replied. I even offered to send the broken pieces so they can perhaps improve their design but they did not reply. Now, more than a month later, I still do not have my replacement and I still haven't put my ring video doorbell back. I would not recommend this because if something happens to your doorbell boa, you cannot rely on the company to help you out with a simple replacement.",

Then, I pretended I was a burglar and tried to remove it by trying to push the foam: impossible! Proceeded to install it on my door: very easy, works perfectly. Wanted a product that could work with different brands of video doorbells in case I want to upgrade in the future for a newer model or different brand and I did not want to drill any holes in my brick wall for the same reason: this product is THE solution I needed, for the present and the future!",

There were guidelines in the package on which foam to use for Eufy but mine is a slimmer model so have to use extra pieces on the side to secure the doorbell. Other than the extra padding, the rest of the installation was easy. I do get pivotal view of my entrance after the installation which is good. One think I notice though is the door mount has added thickness to my door and resulted in tiny gaps between the door and the weather strip; we will have to apply extra weather strip to seal the gaps.",
