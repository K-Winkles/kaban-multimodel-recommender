It was easy to install and set up and integrates quite easily with other Amazon products. The day images are in color with nice crisp quality. The night time images are not quite as clean and they come out in black and white. The night videos are distinguishable and they do the job. I live in a condo complex and this camera lets me know what is going on in my area. I find this helpful.",

My work area is all the way in the back and at times I cannot hear my door bell or when they knock. I love that I do not have to open the door if it is an unknown person knocking. I can see when my shipments are being delivered. Or if someone wanted to steal my packages. Their plans are very affordable monthly. I honestly feel safer with having the camera at my door. It really does make things easier and convenient if I am not home to get my packages. I can speak and hear through the device which is awesome. Thank you for this amazing device.",
