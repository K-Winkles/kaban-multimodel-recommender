                "reviewText": "This was useful for installing over siding. A few minor points: screws seemed a bit long, it'd be good to include slightly shorter ones to avoid penetrating the envelope (the ring's so light anyway, it's overkill). Finally the angle left the Ring very slightly angled up, maybe just a degree or two, but it makes it more susceptible to having rain drops land on it. Overall still a good option if you have slanted siding.",
