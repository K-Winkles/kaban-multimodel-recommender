                "reviewText": "I bought this to use with the Unify Protect G4 Doorbell in the U.K. and it works as expected when following the wiring diagram in the doorbell\u2019s setup instructions. I bought this as it was one of the few that I was able to import it into the U.K. to replace my doorbell chime box, as I preferred to wire this up as per Ubiquiti\u2019s instructions rather than using a relay with my current 6VA U.K. chime box. Attached is a photo of it next to the doorbell transformer the Unify doorbell ships with (on the left in gray). I drilled a hole in the side of the two boxes to allow for the Ubiquiti adapter cables, you\u2019ll also need a short run of cable to complete the circuit, only a few cm. Took about 10 minutes to mount and wire up.The time between the two chimes is a little slower than I expected which could be a power related issue but it\u2019s less than a second, the bell can be clearly heard throughout the house which is its function. It has a satisfying \u201cding-dong\u201d noise that\u2019s to be expected from a mechanical chime.For anyone looking to fit a mechanical chime to their Unify Protect G4 Doorbell in Europe, using the included transformer and adapters included within the doorbell\u2019s box, then this is what you\u2019re looking for.",

Unfortunately, the existing doorbell chime which was a mechanical one works on an 8VAC transformer and is rated with maximum 16VAC. I\u2019ve upgraded the transformer to a 24VAC and was in search for a doorbell and found this one on Amazon.First as we all do go through reviews, I found out one customer used it with Amazon doorbell hence gave it a try and was amazed of this did work pretty wellThis Doorbell is rated 16VAC, however it works perfect with a 24VAC transformer that Amazon recommends for the Ring video doorbell.My existing doorbell was mounted vertical and this doorbell don\u2019t seem to have holes to fix it vertically. Just drill tow holes on the sides and it fit perfectly to the existing holes on the wall.NO humming noise so its pretty solid device if you think of buying a doorbell or want to upgrade like me. Check the attached photos how I did mine.Oh.. and lastly, get the extended warranty which is free, you have to email as their website seem to be down for maintenance. Email is on their website",
