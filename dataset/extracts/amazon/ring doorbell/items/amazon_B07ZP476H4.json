As described, the doorbell will not ring my two old charms, but I did not have to use the jumper wires. I left the wires alone to operate my old backdoor bell button. Only problem was connecting to Bluetooth to set up the system. It would not connect until I used the setup codes (QR) on the device and not the QR code on the instruction card. The setup code was different. The supplied AC Wi-Fi charm works well. The doorbell camera image quality is excellent. Human detection works well. Mobile app is easy to use and monitors everything as promised. I do recommend this doorbell highly.",

                "reviewText": "I can't say for sure, but I can say every doorbell camera I researched required you to purchase a monthly cloud membership to store your videos OR they held them for 24 hours and dumped them. Eufy allows you store your data on a SD card installed in the 'ringer' which is plugged inside your home. Yeah, maybe a SD card will set you back 30 bucks, but after that, no monthly fees and you have complete access and control of you video data. In a age where more and more personal data is being hacked, why wouldn't you want to have one less thing to worry about? If that doesn't do anything for you, how about the clarity of the videos or live feed, the minimal false alerts or the ability to pan and zoom both live and recorded? I can zoom my video doorbell to see a local radio tower red light blinking on top of the transmission tower, and it's a half mile away! No, I can't tell you the wattage of the buld, but pretty impressive I can see it from a doorbell on my front porch. Security for my family and security for our data, a win win.",

                "reviewText": "Coming from a Ring doorbell, I changed to this one to stop the monthly/yearly bills. I do use Eufy for security cameras around the house, so figured I just swap to a doorbell. This thing is simple to set up and works well. It's pretty straightforward to set up. Just make sure you have a transformer that meets the specifications. I got the 16v 30va transformer and had no problems with the doorbell. One nice feature is the zone setting within the app to help with alerts and such.I've had no issues with other Eufy products, so not expecting any issues with this one. I do realize, though, that this probably won't connect with the home base 3. While the other devices on the Eufy app display that they are able to connect with HB3, this doorbell doesn't. I can't say 100% as I don't own one, but that's my guess since it doesn't have an option to add it to HB3 on the app.No issues at this time. Will update if any do come up. Got this renewed, and had an issue with a part, but the seller made it very easy to get that broken part replaced, and everything else was great.",

                "reviewText": "This deserves ZERO stars across the board for product, design, and support. Bought this as a Xmas gift but didn\u2019t get around to install until summer (past the only 90 day warranty).Out of the box this unit was a hassle:1) requires jumper on your doorbell for power supply which disables your bell- that\u2019s why is comes with remote speaker.2) the serial on the envelope was different than the unit. You have to scan this to install while it\u2019s powered. Not helpful when you have it wired up to connect and then have to peel it off and figure out how to scan it while it dangles from a wire.3) appears to have a hungry appetite for power. I could never get it to chime (a signal for inadequate power supply) or connect to the app during install. After reading all the knowledge base I decided to replace my transformer to ensure adequate power. I replaced with transformer per Eufy spec \u2026 still did not work.After hours of testing, finally getting out the multi meter and then contacted customer support who refused to replace the unit. I get it \u2026 \u201c90 days of warranty.\u201d That said, I have had excellent experience with Phillips, TP-Link and others who back their products and replace them when they die. This was a total exercise is frustration and waste of hours. I will NEVER by another Eufy product!",

                "reviewText": "Minus 2 for the fine print even in the Amazon listing it does say (I read after the fact) that it WILL BYPASS your doorbell chime. A plug in the wall chime comes with it and isn\u2019t even loud enough to hear in your bedroom on the other side of the door. It is super quiet and doesn\u2019t sound as cool as your existing doorbell chime. I don\u2019t understand why this is a requirement because my ring worked with it but I switched to eufy because I don\u2019t want to pay $3 a month for something that should be free. So pick a struggle, pay $3 a month with ring or not have it work with your existing chime with eufy.If you don\u2019t care about your chime working or not, the rest of the details are awesome! Easy to setup the app is great the quality is great the doorbell chime not working has been a whole day of headaches for me and I considered sending it back but now I\u2019m just gonna leave it as is and be 3-star satisfied. Can\u2019t have it all with a doorbell, I guess I should get into the business because these companies can\u2019t get it together.",
