Plus, with constant power, the doorbell can use more features.I have a Ring 2nd gen doorbell and this adapter works perfectly with it. I didn\u2019t have to worry about wiring in a solar panel, which was a huge relief,. I use solar on my cameras, but couldn't figure out how to use solar with this one. The cable is long enough to reach the power source without any issues. (I fed it through a window)",
