                "reviewText": "I used the 1080 slim model with 2 eufy cam 2 pro. I liked it so much I decided to upgrade the camera of the doorbell from 1080p to this 2k.That was a huge mistake. When I paired this doorbell, I wouldn\u2019t get any notifications (except when they pressed ring button) of any motion. My other cameras continued to work fine. I contacted eufy support and got some terrible support. They told me the chime can only support 1 camera. I explained to them I previously had 3 cameras on it and it worked fine. They kept saying only one camera and I\u2019ll have to buy a homebase. I checked on eufy support and found documentation stating the chime supported 3 cameras. This was directly on their website. They said that isn\u2019t supported anymore. I also found similar documents stating it would support 2 cameras per chime. He said that also wasn\u2019t true. Again, this was on the official eufy website. He said he updated my account and I would need to reset my cameras for it to take affect. I thought he did something to help the new camera work. He didn\u2019t. He actually ruined my other three cameras. When they came back on, they no longer worked. They won\u2019t send notifications and often unpair themself from chime. When I told him that he said he had to push the new feature set which would limit me to only 1 camera per chime and it would work better. I was pretty frustrated and asked him to revert that as I used 3 cameras and they worked fine for many months. He wasn\u2019t interested. He told me to buy a new homebase and get over using the chrome again. I told him I wasn\u2019t paying them more money since they just ruined my product set up. He stated I can earn a free home base by \u201cdonating videos\u201d. I did and found you only get enough credit for half. Then you can\u2019t do anything with the credits and there\u2019s no way to earn more. It\u2019s appears to be a scam. You can\u2019t earn enough points to ever redeem anything. I have spoke to many people and it\u2019s clear they added a feature to limit my chime to only allow one camera. Forcing me to buy a new product from them that I didn\u2019t actually need.I will be returning all of my eufy products that I can and recycling the rest and will never give maker or eufy another dollar. They\u2019re a very predatory company.Also, probably should have mentioned this sooner before going off subject but it appears I got a used, defective device that was missing pieces and doesn\u2019t function correctly. If I received a working product from Amazon, eufy tech support wouldn\u2019t have been able to add this new \u201cfeature\u201d.Either way. I wouldn\u2019t recommend any of their products.",

A couple of bucks for a bag of screws at Home Depot made installation a breeze.",

                "reviewText": "I got this Eufy Security Video Doorbell 2K HD that really works now. Previously, I got a Eufy Security Video Doorbell with the Homebase. The later video doorbell did not work well since there were tons of misses than hits. It did not capture videos of people passing by my front door where the doorbell video camera was installed. If it did capture videos of people, the video plays people that have already passed by without recognizing their faces. I became frustrated with the Eufy Security Doorbell with the Homebase so I returned the Eufy Doorobell with the Homebase to Amazon. I scouted out for another doorbell video camera but I am unsure about their quality and how good their customer service is. I realize that Eufy security has good customer service rating so I settled for another Eufy security doorbell thinking that the first Eufy video doorbell could just be defective, or not working as it should be. I was able to find the Eufy security video doorbell 2K HD that is a little bit cheaper than the first one. As to its performance, having observed it for a week, I can say that it is doing its job as described in the advertisement. I am satisfied with the quality so far, and I cannot complain this time. However, I have to see its performance for a month to be certain how good its quality, and performance.",

Features started to not work one by one until one of our phones could no longer connect. This one is hassle free. Easy to install, set up and use. Again, unlike the ring. Sometimes it takes a bit longer to connect when you're away from home, but it's not that big of a deal.",
