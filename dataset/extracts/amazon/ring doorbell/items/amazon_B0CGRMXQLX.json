You'll need to have separate networks for 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi. Make sure they have different names, and connect the camera to the 2.4GHz network. Why is the battery not charging? Please ensure a transparent or black insulating strip on the bottom of the battery has been removed. Consider trying a different charger to determine if it's a charger issue. Typically, it takes about 14 hours to fully charge using a 5V1A charger. How many users can view the doorbell camera at the same time? The main account can allow access to the device for 8 other accounts. While 3 users can watch the video simultaneously, only one can use the intercom at a time. Do I need to buy an SD memory card for this doorbell camera? No. This doorbell camera doesn't use SD cards; it stores videos in the cloud. What to do if the device fails to connect to the network? 1). Device supports 2.4G Wi-Fi only, please check the your network before connecting it. 2). Ensure Correct Wi-Fi and Password Entry, delete and reconnect the Wi-Fi might be helpful. 3). Please check the distance between device and Wi-Fi router.",

                "reviewText": "The pros - Excellent picture quality, easy to use app, and simple installation of the device. The Cons - The app is buggy when logging on from more that one device, and the battery stamina is worrisome. The battery drain may have to do with our -30 degree windchill, so the jury is still out and I will update once the weather warms up. Good value for the price!",

                "reviewText": "The cost of this little gem was so low I figured I'd give it a try. I got here and set up was simple and installation was easy. I still can't believe how well it works, for the cost. The only thing I wish it had that more expensive models have is a way to change the shape of the area of coverage. That's ok, for my application, this works just fine. Oh and web storage is dirt cheat too. I figured that that was where they were going stick it to the consumer, but very, very reasonable rates. I wish there was a higher rating than four stars just for that.",

                "reviewText": "What a bummer. The battery dies every few days, which means most of the time the battery is dead and the doorbell and camera don't work. At least the doorbell could work if the camera died, but nope. I've missed several people at my door because they're ringing the bell but I'm unaware because the battery already died.Also, the doorbell rings OUTSIDE as well as inside and this is annoying to my neighbors.You can not view any videos that are saved unless you pay for a subscription from Awit. Which means it's only a live camera, and not a recorder unless you pay more for that service.",
