                "reviewText": "This solar charging is working with my Ring Doorbell camera. I haven't had to pull the Ring battery out to recharge it since installing the panel. It keeps my batteries at a steady 90% plus charge.The only drawbacks are: it that when I check the Ring doorbells health, it sometimes doesn't recognize the solar charger is connected. But it still keeps it charged. Plus, the solar panel and Ring camera do not mark the connections as + or -. If it doesn't work, switch connections. Yoiu'll need your phone to check your device health to monitor the charging.I used the AlertCam 2-in-1 gutter mount as they both use the bolt threads: female in the solar panel and male for the mount. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQXXCKDG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details",

It's receiving sunlight as you can see, however it doesn't charge my ring. It is actually estrange because as you can see, it says hardwired instead of solar. I'll keep it connected for a few days and provide an update if needed.11/23 update: the solar panel didn\u2019t work at all! Didn\u2019t maintain the charge worst charge the battery. The panel has been expose to direct sunlight the whole time. Would recommend. I started a refund claim.",
