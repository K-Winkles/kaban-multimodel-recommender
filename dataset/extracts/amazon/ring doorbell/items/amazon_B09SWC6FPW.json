Will be returning the adhesive mount with the little screw which was impossible to tighten from the bottom angle. Placed the ring doorbell in the case, installed the 5 screws to secure the case and immediately put it on my door. I would 100% recommend the bracket over the adhesive that you have to wait 24 hrs. Then the next problem is that screw that is so tiny it keeps falling out of the case, before you can get it screwed in. So if you want something easy, get the anti theft video doorbell bracket. I\u2019m a woman and didn\u2019t need a man to help me, and the directions were well written.",
