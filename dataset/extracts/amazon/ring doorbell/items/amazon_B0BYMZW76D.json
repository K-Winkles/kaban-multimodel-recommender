Only thing I hate about it is the screw that attaches to the mount at the bottom is so tiny, its practically impossible to handle. And any time I need to remove the doorbell from the mount to charge it, it takes two people- one to remove the screw and catch it (because if you drop it you'll need a microscope to find it) and another person to catch the camera and mount before it crashes onto the floor. I wish there was some way for the mount to snap into the adhesive backing and stay and then use the screw for safety to prevent theft instead of relying completely on that tiny screw to hold it in place.",

The view is not as clear using the casing because u can see the corners of the box. But it's clear enough. Bottom screw is a bit hard but I screwed it in a little ways then put the box on and finished screwing it in. The black inserts I couldn't use to make my camera more stable I wasn't able to fit the back on so I didn't use them. If it continues to stick during cold weather or rain this beats drilling holes in to your home..",
