                "reviewText": "Easy to install and looks nice. It works when wired to my one front doorbell (a Google Nest Gen 1 set for mechanical chime), ding dong sounds classic and nice medium volume, but it chimes with an electrical sounding buzz when it chimes. I have it on a new 24v transformer, perhaps too much voltage? It is not constant and rarely activated, so I am leaving it installed. All wiring is correct and tight and I have researched the wiring setup to death, do I know it's the chime.One helpful tip, if you are using a Google Nest or similar smart doorbell, set it to activate your indoor chime, but be sure to select that you have a mechanical chime (not electronic), it will ring quicker and buzz less when it rings. Nothing's perfect nowadays, and neither is this door chime.",

                "reviewText": "I have not received the unit yet and my review is about Newhouse's pre-sales support. I asked about the acceptable voltage range for the CHM3D product and quickly received a technically-useful answer I can actually use. The answer may help others, both in deciding whether this is a manufacturer they want to use, and when selecting a transformer:Q from me: What is the safe voltage range for the 16vac input on the CHM3D?A from Newhouse: Voltage should read between 18 - 22 volts A/C on the low voltage side of the transformer when chime is NOT playing. If the voltmeter reads below 18 volts when the chime is NOT playing or below 16 volts when the chime IS playing, replace the transformer.",
