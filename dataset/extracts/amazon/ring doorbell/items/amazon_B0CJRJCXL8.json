                "reviewText": "I mostly like this doorbell. The picture quality is outstanding for the price, motion detection is good, and it activates the chime (most of the time) when someone rings the bell. My big issue is the short battery life. Even after lowering the motion-detection setting to lessen the frequency of activation, the charge doesn\u2019t last more than three weeks.",

                "reviewText": "Good quality video. I like the adjustments and features for the price, cheaper than the cheapest ring. I installed a micro SD card. I also purchased a small USB solar panel to recharge without having to take it off and on every time. The solar panel on a cloudy day will take the charge from about 25% to 100% in about 2 days. Full sun probably even faster. Then I just unplug it and set it aside until next time. Overall I like this for my purposes and I love that it is wireless. It sits in the direct sun in Florida so only time will tell, I will update accordingly.",
