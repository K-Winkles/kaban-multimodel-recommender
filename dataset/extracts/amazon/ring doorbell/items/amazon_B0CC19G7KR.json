                "reviewText": "I have siding on my house. I received a second generation Ring doorbell as a gift. The bracket that comes with the doorbell, is intended for a flat surface. To create a flat surface for the doorbell, I needed an additional bracket to accommodate the slanted siding, and give me a flat surface to mount the ring bracket and doorbell to. This bracket is well-made, and is shaped correctly to mount on siding, for the doorbell. What makes it frustrating, is the screw holes. They are perfectly aligned for the Ring doorbell, but the holes are too small for the screws provided with the doorbell. It\u2019s important do use the screws provided with the doorbell, in order not to void any warranty. Finding the right drillbit, and the right drill, to drill into the bracket, making the holes large enough to fit Rings provided screws. I spent a lot of time trying to find the right, drill & drill bit. Once I got the holes drilled out, everything went together perfectly. This bracket does provide a sturdy mount for the doorbell.",
