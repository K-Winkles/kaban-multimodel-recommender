                "reviewText": "I live in an apartment and cannot not drill/screw this device into the sliding as it is not my property. Also I was concerned about theft or damage to my device from neighbors. The adhesive is strong and sticks to the from metal door, no drilling, damage or screws. The security cage ensures my device cannot be easily damage, hit, or broken from neighbors or a burglar. It does have a security tiny screw with a special tool to secure device & makes it easy to remove and charge the battery. Yes anyone with this tiny security tool can unscrew and remove the doorbell camara but not quickly without being seen or alerted and allowing me time to contact the police. Definitely worth the cost if you live in a rental property to avoid damage to building but want to fell safe, secure with your door bell monitor. Being a single mum of two kids, I do not like to open my door if the knock is unexpected or late at night. Or this allows me to monitor the in/out of my rental property from maintenance or the property owner. I deserve privacy, security, and monitored access",

                "reviewText": "I really appreciate the adhesive part of this product being very strong. I applied pressure to it and even tried to pull it off, but it didn't budge. I placed my ring camera in it after six hours, and it's still holding up strongly. Although the screw part is set back, I managed to make it work without any problem. Moreover, I love the fact that people can't unscrew it easily because the screwdriver is uniquely designed. The black parts on the sides are too thick to fit, but that doesn't bother me since it doesn't affect the camera's field of view. Initially, when you push the doorbell, it pushes back, but I found a solution by cutting the back strip in half and placing it horizontally at the bottom of the box. This fixed the issue, and now there's no more pushback. I'm really satisfied with it, and I'll definitely order another one if I need a ring for my back door. Just ordered my 2nd one now I have one at my front and back door I\u2019ll put one at every door if I had more doors\ud83d\ude0d",
