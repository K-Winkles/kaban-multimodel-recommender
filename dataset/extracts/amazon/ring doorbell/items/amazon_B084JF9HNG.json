This receiver does not emit annoying humming noise when plugged in like one I tried before. This receiver is completely silent until you want to hear it (when you ring the doorbell, of course)! Ot has three volume levels, but the loudest setting isn\u2019t that loud. It is not as loud as another doorbell I have tried. I know because with my other doorbell, the person ringing the doorbell could hear the speaker through the door. With this one, it is Boyd loud enough to be heard even when the receiver is plugged in on the other side of the door. So, keep that in mind when considering if this is loud enough for you. Otherwise, this a fantastic doorbell!",

                "reviewText": "I really liked how easy it was to set up this doorbell. It wasn't like trying to figure out how to run a cyclotron or anything, but I am on the impatient side, and prefer something be \"plug and play\" as opposed to needing to tinker with it, or having to fuss a lot with the instructions.It took roughly all of five minutes to have the doorbell up and running after taking it out of the box. I opened the push-button part with a flathead screwdriver, and installed the battery, as per the instructions. I then anticipated the doorbell button and the body of the doorbell itself needing to be paired, or synced. But to my surprise, the doorbell just- worked, right away. After plugging in the main doorbell component to the wall, I pressed the button part by mistake. The plugged-in component then serenaded us with a soft, velvety \"ding- dong... ding- dong.\" The tone wasn't tinny or irritating at all, much to my relief. The default volume setting is a tiny bit on the loud side, but that is fine, as I walk around all day wearing Bluetooth headphones, and am a bit deaf in one ear after my years of being in a band, before people started wearing earplugs to gigs.Our last wireless doorbell's chime, in comparison to this model's, was cheap-sounding, and sharp. This new doorbell- well--- the only way I know how to describe its gentle chiming is-- \"classy.\" The old doorbell's ringing made us jump. This one seems to sing to us, gently announcing \"good news... good news.\" I know it sounds silly- but it's the truth!I decided to use a strip of strong velcro to attach the push button part to the molding around the outside of my apartment door. My other wireless doorbell kept falling off of the molding- the paint on it is a very high gloss- and eventually it just stopped working. I had used the tape that came with the last doorbell to stick it on the moulding, and that didn't work well. So I by-passed the double-sided sticky pad that was in the box with this new doorbell, and stuck it on there with the strong velcro. The button for this doorbell is now very snugly attached, but can be removed if need be.The doorbell is working great. The other day we had several deliveries, and the handyman needing to come and go throughout the afternoon, and this new doorbell got a workout. But the sound of it never became tiresome. Its chimes are always pleasant to the ear. It's also easy to hear from any part of the apartment. The design of the doorbell and button part are nice and sleek-looking (I ordered the white one, as my front door moulding is white) and esthetically pleasing.Pros: easy to get up and running; no complicated set-up; doorbell components synced themselves; agreeable chiming sound (we just left it on the default \"ding dong\" one, as it was so nice); attractive.Cons: none that I can find- and I highly recommend it. For the price, it's a great little doorbell!",
