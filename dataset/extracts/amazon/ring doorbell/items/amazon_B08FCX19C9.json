Customer service did a good job setting me up on the year plan to coexist with my other ring devices. I am actually impressed with the quality of the lighting and the video. I know theyre due to come out with a new version so paying full price wasnt a viable option. This said the device is super amazing it covers the whole front side of my house clearly. Being able to dim the lights is so awesome because im not trying to be an annoying neighbor. Like others say the motion is very senative so the lowest level of that works great for me. The video recording really is impressively clear and the birds eye draws out a precise map of where people walked. Its kinda freaky and almost creepy how high tech that feature is",

I had installed a ring doorbell at their house previously and now my mother in law expressed the desire to see in front of their house as well. There was no electrical box on the front so I bought the wall mount kit with this unit and was able to simply drill a hole and run the wire along the garage ceiling and plug it in where the garage door plugs in. Fantastic picture quality and the phone interface was familiar to them.",

                "reviewText": "This is more a critique of the refurbish program than the product itself since I am unable to complete the install because of a required PIN number that\u2019s definitely missing from anywhere in or on the factory box. The process came to a hard stop and after 30 mins troubleshooting with tech support, I\u2019m left with nothing but a hole in my wall where the original fixture used to be, at least for the next 3 days until the replacement arrives.Disappointed because there are a number of reported issues surrounding the readiness of these refurb products\u2026installers not able to complete the software portion of the install for various proof of purchase or security issues. I imagined it would be easier to reset software/QR codes and serial numbers, than it is to refresh hardware and packaging, but the former is apparently more challenging.Ring needs to improve quality control if they\u2019re hoping for a successful refurb program. The discount being applied and the resulting cost of recovery and/or replacement does not sound like success. 4 stars and not less because this is my 3rd Ring product and 2nd refurb but first time having an issue. The products are intuitive, love the alert response time, and appreciate the software that ties them all together. I intend to keep growing my Ring ecosystem.Update: The replacement arrived and installed without issues. Strangely the QR code did have a pin at the bottom this time (missing on the refurb) but it wasn\u2019t required during installation.",

I tried the cheap solar powered ones and they always seem to give out after a few months. The Ring ones last and outshine them in almost every aspect. The light is bright and easy to setup but I do strongly recommend making sure its anchored in properly in case of wind . The motion detection is great and pretty on point. Purchase the accessory if you don't want to deal with hard wiring. Excellent purchase and would easily recommend - I plan on getting another one for the side yard as well.",

Lets me keep an eye on my house when I am away as well as sharing with neighbors who watch each others houses when they are away. Ring support is also first notch if you have issues. Highly recoment this brand. It intergrates well into Alexa evviroment if you have any of the Show devices. I do not know if the same integration is availible with Goodle hub as I don't have that.",
