                "reviewText": "Updated 11/22/23: changed my 1 star review to 4. Ordered the 1 receiver 2 doorbell system back in June. Worked great when installed. It stopped working a few weeks ago (although it\u2019s only been rang probably 10 times), replaced batteries and still doesn\u2019t work. Can\u2019t find a number for the lifetime warranty and too late to return. BUT company watches their reviews and responds asap! They have given me a full refund. Since they were so kind to do this I have ordered the same product again. If it was just a fluke that the other one stopped working, I will be back to change my review again. Changed the review because their customer service is great!",

                "reviewText": "The Plug and go system is simple enough. I did reprogram my 3 buttons to the 3 different receivers in different combinations in hopes that I would know which door was being rung. I placed the receivers and then walked to where the buttons would be placed and sadly 1000 feet was wishful thinking. The front door bell works well because the bell and receiver are within site and only have glass doors to work through but my back doors wouldn't work where I needed the receivers due to the stone walls. I'm lucky if I got 100 feet off them. the price is still ok if all 3 work but since I only needed 1 button and 1 receiver in the end I paid more than I would have liked.",
