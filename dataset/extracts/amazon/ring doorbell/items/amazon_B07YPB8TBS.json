They tried to send me some batteries for free. Unfortunately, they were back ordered. Instead they replaced all the lights. This resolved my issue. This was customer service at their finest. I figured I was out of luck due to being out of warranty. But, they made it right. I now recommend this product.Original Post:I bought 8 of these in November 2020. They worked great until July 2022. The solar panels are no longer charging the battery on half of them. Which is a bummer. They are out of warranty. They currently cost $34+ to replace a piece. Other than that, they worked great and provided enough light for our stairs going to the house.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased a total of 8 Ring solar path lights w/ bridge in August 2021. When I contacted Ring a year later, in August 2022, about my solar path light issues, tech support was very helpful and worked through troubleshooting my problem. It came down to drained batteries that would not recharge sufficiently to power their devices. I was informed that batteries are not covered under their warranty and they no longer provide replacements.I purchased the replacement lithium ion batteries that they recommended . The path lights started functioning again; however within 2 weeks all my batteries had discharged and were not recharging even though solar path lights are and have always been in full Arizona sun. Plugged in cable charger and now batteries only charge to 85% & will only light up while on the charging cable while inside the house. Not useful!A year of great solar lighting out of the original set of Ring rechargeable solar batteries is a fair expectation here in AZ. Why don't you sell the same Ring batteries as replacements? While I am a big Ring fan, I am extremely disappointed with this particular Ring product. The battery is the weak link here. Ring, you need to step up your game here and sell the proper replacement batteries! You also need to be upfront with the customer and market the path light as needing solar batteries replaced after some number of charges.",
