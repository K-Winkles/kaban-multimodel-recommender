In my case the casing around the door was too narrow and was hard against a brick wall. By using this mount we were able to easily attach it as the mounting plate is about 1/3 narrower than the back plate of the Ring. I did end up using more robust anchors, but that was my call, the ones they provided were adequate. We were also able to bend the linkage a bit so we could tilt the camera upward as our original doorbell was installed low, by doing so we get better face pictures and the doorbell works fine and rings the inside chime. The metal itself is powder coated steel and is of a robust gauge. I am very satisfied with the product.",

Granted, I used a better screwdriver (the one which comes with the Ring itself) and a power drill to make starter holes. Was a simple/quick install. My only initial concern/complaint would be the mounting bracket itself (the small square you screw into your house) wasn't level to the portion that holds the Ring, so I had to mount it to my siding slightly angular to have the Ring be level when attached. Not a big deal since nobody can see it. This is why I am giving 4 stars, however.",

                "reviewText": "I'm writing this review to share that I ordered the Ring 1 Angle Mount for the Ring 2nd Generation. There was some confusion in the reviews as to whether the Ring 1 or Ring 2 was appropriate for 2nd generation. The answer is, the Ring 1 is the proper fit.This mount is sturdy easy to install. Unfortunately, I had to return it because I didn't have enough flat space to mount it with the decorative trim around my door.",

                "reviewText": "This baby works, and it\u2019s the only solution I\u2019ve found for narrow-trim doorways and installing Ring\u2019s enormous video doorbells. In my situation, I wanted to put it over my existing doorbell and use the wires. The normal Ring bracket just wouldn\u2019t fit. I thought about only using battery power, but the stone veneer around my doorway would have been difficult to work with, and I wasn\u2019t about to mount this thing on my door.My doorway trim gave me about 1.8 inches of real estate to work with. As an additional complication, part of the trim bulges up and isn\u2019t flat. While this bracket wasn\u2019t small enough to fit only on the flat portion of the trim, it was still small enough for me to install well within the 1.8 inches and account for angled screws due to the bulged portion of the trim. I was then able to feed the wires through the bracket, connect the wires to my Ring doorbell, and install Ring\u2019s bracket on top of it. Worked like a charm.A couple notes:1) Some people have mentioned being unable to tighten the screw that controls the bracket\u2019s ability to angle the doorbell side-to-side. Because they can\u2019t tighten it, the doorbell moves easily after they get it at the desired angle. This is because the nut that holds the tightening screw in place spins when they try to tighten the screw. You can fix this by ensuring the nut doesn\u2019t spin/move while tightening. To do so, you could use needle-nose pliers to hold the nut, or the box-end of a combination wrench. I believe I used an 8mm wrench to hold the nut in place while tightening, and now it\u2019s tight.2) The big bracket that Ring provides you, that you will eventually screw into this bracket, has a magnet on it (at least, mine does). This magnet supposedly helps hold the doorbell in place while you screw the doorbell into Ring\u2019s bracket. Overall, the magnet is unnecessary, and in my case the magnet kept messing up the placement of the bracket since the magnet would move where Ring\u2019s bracket wanted to sit (this bracket is metal). You can easily pop the magnet out of Ring\u2019s bracket and throw it away. It is held by some adhesive, so you\u2019ll have to pop it out with the flat-head wrench or something similar.3) The rubber grommet to help cover exposed wires is a nice touch, but doesn\u2019t really fit too well and isn\u2019t very flexible, so it\u2019s hard to work with. If your door area is covered, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the wires, and you can always cover any small wire holes with electrical tape. I was able to make the rubber grommet work by cutting off the end of one side.",

                "reviewText": "I spent a lot of time trying to make sure this was the right one to fit my model of Ring doorbell camera. Because a LOT of reviews seem to be about different models of the same mount for different camera models. So in finding this one, that says IN THE TITLE that it is for Ring 3, and it used a picture of the same model I have, that this mount would actually work.Went to install it today and NONE of the screw holes line up. NONE! Not even the top two... or maybe only the bottom two... not even left or right line up individually. Because it is a cheap piece of crap, I figured I'll just drill my own holes and make it work, which I did. At this price it wasn't worth my time returning it and trying to find another one to fit that most like would also NOT fit.DO NOT RECOMMED as the description DOES NOT match the product as delivered.",
