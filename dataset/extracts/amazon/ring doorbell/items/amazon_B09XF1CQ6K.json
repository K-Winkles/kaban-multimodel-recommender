If you end up going with a different product, make sure you check those reviews warning against this. *This particular one does indeed work for the RVD2.*However, the instructions are confusing, in part because of the universal nature of this mount, but also the graphics which are used. I've included a picture of the section that refers to my [second generation] model. It appears to picture the first generation model.They also suggest mounting the back plate to it after it's already on the wall. I'd consider going the other way - I would imagine you're less likely to be fumbling with / dropping the small screws.The only other thing worth mentioning: when I tightened down the top and bottom screws to lock in the desired angle, the plastic began to slightly deform. Maybe I used too much elbow grease. I backed off a little and everything still seems secure.I'm fine with the appearance after installing. Note that I didn't use a level, I just eyeballed it.",

The only negative is that the screws that come with it are not correct and if used, can damage the unit, per the instructions that came with it. Had to pay extra for the correct screws. If they know that the included screws are not the correct ones, then they should have included them with the product.",
