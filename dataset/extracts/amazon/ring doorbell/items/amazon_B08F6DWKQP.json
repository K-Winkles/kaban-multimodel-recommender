The only thing I had to purchase extra was a ground wire to go from my old fixture to the ring. It was very straightforward to install. My video is crystal clear. Wide viewing area. Spot lights are blinding bright perfect for my back deck. The motion sensor works great and the time for the lights to shut back off I have set for 30 seconds if no motion detected. Love this purchase. I access the ring app from work to check on my home and the alerts come on my phone to easily view. This I would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Ring is a good company and their cameras are effective. These Ring Camera Floodlights are great. The light is bright, the Alexa connectivity works great, and the motion sensing works well. I have them all around my house and garage, and I cover every inch around the perimeter of my home. Ring support is great. I've had problems with my cameras and Ring support did a great job troubleshooting and eventually replacing a few of my cameras when they went bad with their extended support that comes with being a paid subscription Ring customer. The quality of the picture is great and I was able to install all of the camera's myself. I consider myself a very capable DIY'er and these were no problem to wire and install. Highly recommended. One unintended benefit are the nature videos that the Ring cameras provide. I live near a park in the middle of a major city, and very often my Ring cameras will catch foxes, rabbits, raccoons, opossums, and other animals as they traverse my yard during the overnight hours. I never suspected that the animals were as active as they are. I also was able to help my local police department when there was a break-in in my neighborhood and one of my cameras captured a suspicious individual as he passed by my home. But you have to remember, these cameras are deterrents and don't always stop crime from occurring. Someone stole the catalytic converter from my car as it was parked in my driveway right under a Ring camera at 3am. The only thing that the camera did was record the 3 minutes that it took the thief to steal my catalytic converter and when the motion lights came on, it made it easier for him to see. At one point he looked dead into the camera, but since he was wearing a ski mask, the police were still not able to identify him... But at least I had the evidence. Oh well. Just know the camera's limits and don't expect them to stop most thieves if they're properly motivated.",
