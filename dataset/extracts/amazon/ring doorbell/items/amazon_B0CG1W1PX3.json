Can recorded footage be stored in the cloud? Cloud service subscription is necessary for storing videos, with a trial offered for free. No charges will occur during this period, if you're not pleased, you can freely cancel during the trial if it doesn't fulfill your needs. Is the doorbell camera designed to work on 5GHz Wi-Fi? The doorbell camera can connect only to 2.4GHz Wi-Fi. If your router provides both 2.4GHz and 5GHz, ensure they're named differently and connect to the 2.4GHz network. Do I need an SD card with this doorbell camera? This doorbell camera doesn't need an SD card. It has cloud storage with a free trial. Is the doorbell camera quick to install? Yes, just follow the simple manual.",

It comes with screws and it also has the option of connecting the device to the wall/door frame with a strong adhesive strip, which is the one I decided to use. The quality is great, and the app interface is user friendly. I highly recommend this product. The only think I would change to make this product perfect is that the chime should have an outlet connection to avoid using a 5V USB port.",

                "reviewText": "Camera was a rebound from the Arlo camera, which no longer functions after the free trail and asks you to open your computer browser to view prices for a subscription to continue to use your camera. I returned that camera right away when I saw it's predatory business practice.After that, I tried out this camera at a fraction of the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that it had most of the same features as the more expensive camera WITHOUT asking you to purchase their subscription. The camera is able to live view and you can preview all of your recordings (photo) on a feed for free.Premium features, however, are locked behind a pay wall ($30/year). These include downloading videos, clicking and viewing the recordings, and access to a cloud storage that keeps up to 30 days of recordings.All features of standard cameras are present, except for an automation to set the camera armed or disarmed with distance or time. It does make a small clicking sound when recording begins that is noticeable to me. However, for $35, this camera is a steal. Adding the $30/year for subscription would take 5 years for it to match the price of a $200 camera!Overall, picture quality is good, form factor is discreet, and I am very pleased with it.",
