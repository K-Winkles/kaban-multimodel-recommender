                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Rarely review stuff but this thing worked great in every way",
                "reviewText": "I never bother to review stuff but I was so pleased with this thing, I figured I would detail my experience in the event it would be useful to others. Replaced my original Ring Pro with a v2 pro, which from what I read does not fit the same mounting brackets as the first Ring.On my first Ring, I used one of the Ring angle mounts, which allow 3 stacking pieces to turn the camera 15 30 or 45 degrees to the side. Apparently in their infinite wisdom, Amazon who now owns Ring, only makes a limited angle mount for the v2 pro that does not do the same as the original. I bought this mount since it looked like it would work, despite being apparently one of countless cheap China made \"random letter\" brands that are all over Amazon. Fast forward to installing.Got the new v2 Ring and removed the old camera and angle mounts. First thing that was awesome about this new angle mount... the original mount had 2 screws mounted underneath into the stucco in specific spots that would not fit the new stock Ring angle mount or the non angled mount for the camera itself. Well this 3rd party mount actually has two vertical openings of about 1 inch each on top and bottom so to screw it into the existing guides in the stucco, you can just adjust the screws along the openings to fit the existing guides. No screwing in new guides into your stucco. Awesome.Next, after screwing in the base plate, I looked at directions and decided based on other comments to not use the rain shield. My doorbell is covered and rain isn't an issue and I didn't want the camera blocked at all. No problem. You just skip that piece. I then mounted the Ring to the bracket and per the directions... super easy. Just a few screws which are identified by letters in the instructions but you could honestly do it without reading them because it's really very obvious and self explanatory. Frankly, I saw someone say they couldn't figure out the instructions and returned this thing... you would have to be a colossal idiot to not be able to figure this thing out without instructions. It's literally half a dozen total screws with like 3 pieces of plastic that have predrilled holes... hard to screw up.After mounting the Ring, I configured it and then slid the Ring out and adjusted the angle in real time by watching it on my phone until I was happy with the angle. Amazon/Ring can't apparently produce a 50 cent piece of plastic to mount this is an intelligent way with a variety of options and angles, yet here is a 3rd party making one that gives you a wide variety of angles and adjustments that is just better top to bottom. After getting the angle where I wanted it, I tightened the screw that is pre mounted in the top and locked the angle where I wanted it, then used the included plastic piece to cover the guide piece on the top where the screw is. Device feels secure and firmly mounted, angles worked great giving a ton of options, all the screws worked without issues, nothing broke nothing stripped, it worked great from start to finish and was super simple.Honestly I could not have been happier considering my low expectations as with most of these kind of items on Amazon. Worked better than the included factory angle option, was intelligently designed enough to make replacing an existing v1 bell with a different sized v2 super easy without removing or replacing the existing holes. Thumbs up.",
