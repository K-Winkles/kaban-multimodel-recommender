However, I came to learn that my door is just too flush. The one area I could securely attach it, this won't attach there because the screws aren't designed to mount side ways or at an angle. Which I'd have to do. There was no way whatsoever to install this. I really tried. It was just too thick. The tightening bracket also seemed to bend at an angle as I tightened it into the door, prior to learning it wouldn't work. I wish this came with an adjustable length bracket. That would've worked well. Or the option to rotate where the screws will align and screw in. Something along those lines would've worked for me in the only compatible area.",
