                "reviewText": "This mount for the Blink video doorbell is nice. It fully encloses it. The plastic is a little flimsy but still sturdy. It comes with a large double sided foam tape so if you don't want to drill holes you may use that to mount it. I like security so I used both the tape and screwed it onto my wall as well. This is a good idea especially if your video doorbell is out in the elements.",
