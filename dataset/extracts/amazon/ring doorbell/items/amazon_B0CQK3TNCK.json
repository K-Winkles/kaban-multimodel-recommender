                "reviewText": "This thing is made of some sturdy steel similar of what you'd find in window guards and there is no way someone will be able to steal your Ring doorbell. They'd really have to break the door, even then you wouldn't be able to get it out. This also allows you to place it on the most optimal spot on your door too, and it can handle doors of almost any thickness that you'd normally see. (Not super thin ones, though). This is supposed to work with Blink doorbells as well, but I couldn't try that out. Nothing is blocked on the camera and infrared signals and it's actually designed with a slight shade which might help with rain or sunlight, but not sure how much effect that will have given this is against your door.I really don't know how else you'd want to mount your doorbell now if you have a door that this will fit. You don't want to mount it naked on your door frame anymore, if you ask me. This is pretty much the perfect solution.",

                "reviewText": "I got this anti theft doorbell holder on a whim hoping it would fit my ring doorbell. I have to say this device is genius, not only does it securely hold my ring doorbell but aesthetically it looks better than just mounting my ring doorbell to the wall or door. The setup is super easy whether you're a renter or home owner which I love. If your home doesn't have a porch the protector actually has a ledge that can help protect against the rain and elements which is nice. Honestly for the price it's a steal because your ring doorbell is an investment and you need to protect your investment.",

Seems pretty secure this way.The directions were semi comprehensive, but not complete. There is a lot of extra packing stuff/filters in the box so your device won't slide around once it's in the doorbell case, but I guess it could be for a blink device which is slimmer - IDK. Once it's on the door, test to make sure you have it tight enough and your done. Quick and easy. But like I said there is a lot of extra padding/filters, if someone knows where they go please lemme know! Thanks",
