                "reviewText": "I bought the previous version of this lock earlier this year and it was a great lock. Fingerprint reader works very well, the RFID reader is amazing and the integration with the phone was pretty good. The touch pad was not the most responsive, but since I mostly used the fingerprint reader, it wasn't too much of a problem.After a while, the lock stop working so I contacted their customer support and they immediately responded within 24hrs. They asked me about the issue with the lock and they decided to replace the lock with this version (newer version) since mine was under warranty. They shipped it right away and I was able to get it within a few days.Couple things I've noticed about this newer version: The fingerprint sensor is a bit larger so its easier to place your finger on the sensor. The locking motor mechanism is a lot better and the motor seems to work with ease. The overall size of the lock has improved making it smaller and slightly more compact. What I was happy to see is that the issue I had with the touchpad was resolved with this newer model and the touch pad is very responsive. Only noticeable difference is that the previous version had a cover over the keyhole, which I wish they still had that for this version.Overall, it's a great lock. It's not perfect since I had some issues trying to connect it to my smart home, but there was no issues with it pairing with the app. Even though it's probably not the most high end lock, The reason I'm giving them a great rating is because of their customer service. Sure, I had to get out of my way to contact them and prove to them my lock wasn't actually working (which I don't blame them for that), but they had excellent customer service with quick response time and very friendly staff.If you're looking to buy a decent smart lock at a good price range, from a company you can trust to provide support if something goes wrong, I say this lock is it.",

                "reviewText": "I did a lot of work before selecting a new smart lock to replace what the developer put into 1,000 houses here. Mine went bad the moment I moved in. Most of the rest of the community still have no idea how to use them or connect them to one system. Everything the developer choose was based upon cost, not use. Thermostat, garage door opene, locks, doorbell cameras, none work together.This one is great! Easy to install. Easy to setup in its own app. Automatic synchronisation with Alexa. Finger prints are super easy to set up. Fobs too.I went down to Lowes to have duplicate keys made. They had a sign up saying they now make fobs too. However, they had no blank keys to cut for this type of lock. And their dib machine could not read my fob. That tells me the depth of the security for this lock. Very Impressive! No one else will be able to make duplicates either! Something about bank level encryption being used. Super!This lock also tells me when it is locked or when it is unlocked. That is very comforting to know as I walk out the door.The app is perhaps the easiest app I have ever used for \"Smart Stuff\". Some require a Doctorate in Computer Science and Programming to use. It has been a while since I had to write code for something. I really do not want to do that anymore if I can avoid it.I added a reinforced deadbolt striker that extends three inches into the door frame. Between it and this lock, someone is going to have a very difficult time breaking in.The most important thing is the voice control. There are days when my pain is just too much to get out of bed. With this lock, and Alexa, I can control the lock on my front door. I can see who is at my door through Blink. Now I can let them in when I need help. For me, that is priceless. My family knows this too and they also have voice control and Alexa control from Hawaii if they need it. That is the purpose of all of this high tech. Peace of mind.It works every time!Great App, easy to use and understand.Easy installation.Simple setup for Voice, Finger print, and Fob.Integrates seamlessly with Alexa.A double locking mechanism included.Good looking too!Small footprint.Great instructions.Everything you need (except tools) are in the box. And the instructions actually make sense.I give this 5 big stars, only because I cannot give six!",

The door lock has a lot of features and the fingerprint sensor works flawlessly. I also enjoyed taking advantage of a lot of great features , such as auto lock, finger print reader, multiple codes to get in, easy to use app etc.After 6 weeks the door lock started glitching until it stopped working. I contacted costumer service and apparently it wasn't a faulty unit , but if water gets inside it damages the motherboard which is exactly what happened. They sent me a replacement and I put duct tape to cover up the key hole and the USB charging port to prevent water from getting in. Hopefully this will prevent the lock from breaking again since this is being used in my backdoor and it is exposed to rain, wind, etc.",

                "reviewText": "So far so good. I live in Northern Ontario where we are currently in our false spring. The fingerprint is very touchy so make sure that you put your finger on there exactly how you programmed it or else it won\u2019t work the first couple times. Auto lock feature is great. I seriously do love how you can control basically all of the settings on your phone. Works very well with my Amazon Alexa and Google Home. I do love how it tells you out loud if you have it programmed to do so that it is unlocked or locked. I also have a ring doorbell so it\u2019s nice to know when someone is there and I can unlock the door for them from my phone wherever I am if needed. Installation was a breeze but I use to work with a locksmith so this was nothing new for me. It\u2019s a great little lock I must say. I\u2019ve only ran into maybe five instances where the touchpad was a little delayed for my liking but that was just more of me being in a rush in those moments. Great if you have kids. It keeps a log of who comes in the house at what times if they used a code or their fingerprint or their key card. You can have your own profiles with fingerprint, code or keycard attached. It\u2019s some pretty nifty tech !",

                "reviewText": "Need to update this review, it\u2019s been about a year a a bit since we\u2019ve had it and had to replace it already. Initial thoughts and feelings about this deadbolt were great however it is not built to last. The motor mechanism with in the deadbolt becomes so weak and fails to turn the latch to lock. We\u2019ve been looked out of our garage numerous times having to go around to the front door and then unlock the door from the inside. Luckily the vendor sent a replacement but it\u2019s the same thing about 3-4 months in. I wouldn\u2019t trust this device if you rely on the finger print, key code or key fob scan to get in. You\u2019d definitely need the key with you because it fails often.Bought this lock to replace an older manual deadbolt. It was somewhat easy to install, but I did have to widen the door hole with a door bore to make it fit to size. So many features and ways to unlock which is so great. The finger print scanner is by far the coolest and easiest way to unlock. We have also set a timer to auto lock so if we ever forget to lock the door it does it on its own. Very happy wife, happy house!",

We do live it but wish the app would show an unlocked icon when it is unlocked. At present it only shows a locked icon and if we want to be sure it is unlocked or locked without going to it we have to press the icon to find out.",
