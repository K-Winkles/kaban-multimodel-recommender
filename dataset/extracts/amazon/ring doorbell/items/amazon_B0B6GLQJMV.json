It has a wide view so you can easily view the whole trailer and you can zoom in to see other things more closely which is nice. The audio works great on it although my employees have a hard time understanding or hearing me on it which doesn't bother me too much cuz I'd rather just watch. The play back for recordings is easy to navigate and use. Overall a very easy install and set up and easy to use app as well. I do connect this to my mobile hotspot and not a wired wifi source and it works great with my hotspot. Definitely recommend.",

Ring gave me clearer pictures and easy to use. Nest does not give me video record without subscription and price are more than double of ring stand up cam. Now I bought another ring to put in my great room as well. Nest system keeps ask me to sign in - may be I am not a account set up. My husband is the account set up person.Love the ring system!",

                "reviewText": "I decided to give Ring a try, starting with just the doorbell camera. I immediately fell in love with it. I had previously used Blink cameras, but they were not satisfactory. They were slow in detecting motion and often failed to pick it up at all. Additionally, they would disconnect easily, which was frustrating. However, after replacing all of them with Ring, I have no complaints. The notifications are accurate and timely, the image quality is awesome, and the two-way speakers are very loud. Installation was also easy, and it perfectly integrates with the Ring security system. I can't wait to see what else Ring has in store.",

                "reviewText": "It is a great indoor camera. If you have a ring ecosystem this fits in and sets up easily. My only gripe with ring is that they are a little more on the expensive side of the cameras for monthly service but they do work well. The only other camera negative is that at night the blue status light is bright but that can be fixed with a little electrical tape, just wish it could be turned off in the settings somewhere.",

It has been working for couple of months but will post again after couple of years.

Works very well with my iPhone and records video if there is an event for later review.",
