The camera is ok .the company are super nice and was contacted me in a good vibe to solve all problems.",

                "reviewText": "I got this camera for my front door. I really like the camera and it's super easy to assemble. It was easy to download the app and connect. I have to recharge it about once a week depending on the weather. When the weather was below freezing for a couple weeks I had to recharge it almost daily, which was annoying, but I understood. What bothers me about the camera is after I charge it, I have to go into my app settings and make sure that the settings I want are checked. For some reason every time I charge it, it no longer will automatically do the wandering alarm or wandering detection. So I do have to go into the app settings and turn on those items again. Which is annoying, but I now know that's just something I have to do every time. Overall, I'm very happy with the camera. It has a clear picture and does great at notifying me when someone is on my front porch.",
