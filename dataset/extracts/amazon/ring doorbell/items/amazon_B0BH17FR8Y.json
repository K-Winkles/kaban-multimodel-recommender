                "reviewText": "I have only had this doorbell camera for a few days at this point but so far I love it. Installation was super easy. Took about 5 mins and anyone can do it. Screws and wall anchors are included with the packaging.The camera itself does a great job of detecting motion and the quality of the video and images are pretty good.The doorbell function works as intended. You hear it nice and loud wherever it is plugged up in the house. You also get a notification from the app on your phone with the option to pull up the live feed. You can use the two way audio at that point by selecting the microphone in the app. Audio quality was good enough to have a clear conversation.Lastly, the battery works well in my opion. After 3 days it is only at 84%. It also charges quickly so no issues with it needing to come down for a few hours every other week or so to do that.Overall, amazing camera doorbell at an amazing price. Give it a shot if you don't want to skip some of the more expensive options but still want a quality product.",

                "reviewText": "This camera really surprised me it delivered on time and the packaging was very secure. It comes with a charger and also a USB doorbell that can be plugged in and Chime through the house when the front doorbell is rang. The visual for this camera is really great. It is able to pick up very clear pictures also, the motion detection on it is surprisingly sharp and clear. You are able to adjust the sensitivity in the resolution all through the app and also speak with people. It is very easy to connect to your phone and WiFi. I\u2019ve had this camera for about two months now and I\u2019ve only had to charge it four times so the battery life is definitely excellent. overall I\u2019m very satisfied.",

Multiple users can access the device.4. Simple user interface for the software.5. Wifi Connection is stable and does not fail6. Video quality is good.Cons:1. Very limited features. No timer for when i can activate the alert mode. Sometimes there are people going around during the day so i want to deactivate the alert during daytime and activate it during the evening. That feature is not there and you need to do it manually.",

It also charges quickly so no issues with it needing to come down for a few hours every other week or so to do that.The door where I had it setup is a bit removed from my router so I did have problems with the connection dropping from good to fair. No fault of the camera but just an FYI. I solved this by getting an inexpensive wifi extender that now helps maintain the signal at good.Overall, amazing camera doorbell at an amazing price.

                "reviewText": "I purchased this camera after an incident with an unknown man at our home (who turned out to have a criminal record and violent tendencies) who was shielding his face and knocking on our door to try to get our kids to let him in.Naturally, I wanted to get the best security that I could to give us all some peace of mind, but we don't have the budget for the expensive name brand. I would highly recommend this camera as an affordable alternative. It's easy to set up, accurate, and a great tool to make us feel safe and more aware of our home surroundings. The image quality is very good. It would be easy to discern a face should the police have to search for someone.",
