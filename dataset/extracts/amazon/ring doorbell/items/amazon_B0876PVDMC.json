It stopped working below -5 degrees Fahrenheit even though it was hardwired and batteries had over 80% charge left. So I am using a heat pad that is constantly on and attached it on the bottom half to keep the battery/device warm. So far it works like a charm past -25 degrees Fahrenheit. Just buyer beware if you live in the arctic and you may need some other source to keep it warm. I am pleased with all of the features though and high definition quality footage even during the night.",
