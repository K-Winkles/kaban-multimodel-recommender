I like that it protects the overall Ring Camera Doorbell, and it has already sustained some rainy weather while keeping the doorbell pretty dry too. The installation was pretty simple and straight to the point; it was a tiny struggle due to having a certain pressure needed to keep in place while screwing it in, but nothing that was overwhelming or still couldn\u2019t be done solo. It does have a great range of adjustability. HOWEVER, you\u2019d have to loosen the screw if you ever wanted to adjust it a different direction or charge your doorbell (if it\u2019s wireless).",

When I put the ring doorbell in the housing and slide it up in the receiver part of the mount, it would not stay in place, kept sliding down. My doorbell and housing both fell and hit the ground, luckily no damage. It was almost impossible to hold the camera and housing in place to the wall mount and try to insert the screw needed to secure in place. You may need to have a board to place underneath or someone to hold in place when inserting the screw. Screws are very tiny and if you are a tall person you will need to get on your knees to look underneath for the screw holes. Recommend having a magnetic tipped screw driver. In the picture you will see the blue up and down arrows, up arrow for the housing and down arrow referred to as the mount. They would not lock in place in order to put the screws in.",

Even if there was a spot to mount, this mount is customizable so you are able to choose which direction to point the ring. We have the wired Ring and it works great for this with holes for wiring.Just make sure to choose the correct mount for your siding option. We just had siding replaced prior so we knew our siding size.Only downside is it really sticks out and a bit bulky.This mount is under a sheltered entrance so it is not so exposed to the elements as much so cannot say how it handles rain and snow.",

It looked really nice and was not too difficult to install. The problem arose when I needed to open the mount to check the wiring on the charger that I had attached to my Ring doorbell. I was unable to remove the security screws that the manufacturer provided. Long story short, the only way I was able to remove my device was to destroy the mount! The security screws supplied by the manufacturer were substandard and had stripped when installed (even using the special screwdriver supplied). They snapped in half when I pryed the mount open. I have returned the mount for a refund.",
