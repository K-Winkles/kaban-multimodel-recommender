                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had 5 of these for roughly 2 years. They\u2019re ok but they work best if you have a group of them. One single light isn\u2019t enough to light much up. But, I use mine in conjunction with my Ring spotlight and floodlight cams. I have them setup so that the spotlights in a certain proximity of my cameras light up when the camera does. I have two of these in my front yard, and 3 in the back. My yard isn\u2019t huge, maybe 1500sq feet front and 3500 back. The yards are not totally lit. But for the price they\u2019re ok. I don\u2019t have the lights themselves turn on when motion is detected, only when my cameras detect motion as mentioned previously. With the lights turning themselves on when motion is detected they were coming on a lot, like every 5 minutes on a windy day. But I do like these lights. They can be adjusted to point at almost any angle, they\u2019re not huge, and not terrible to look at.I don\u2019t see if the description mentions any waterproof specs, but I did just go to change the batteries in one of them, and water came pouring out when I pulled out the battery compartment. Which is what got me to write the review. It was fully closed when I opened it. It wasn\u2019t obvious how water got in. I\u2019ll have to take a closer look. But because of that, going to have to lower my opinion of these lights from what would have probably been a 4 star rating down to a 2. If I can figure out if this was caused by user error or age (I never expected these to last forever) I\u2019ll bump the rating back up.Edit 1 - 10/21/2023Ring saw this review, contacted me to troubleshoot the issue, and then sent me a replacement light. Considering this is one of 5 lights and the others work fine, I\u2019m updating to 5 stars. Was going to stop at 4 but these things aren\u2019t too pricey so I\u2019m going to be generous and say they work exactly as designed. And I have them on my Christmas list so I can add more to my yard. I want my yard to light up like the Griswolds house at Christmas if anyone approaches my house at night. You know, for their safety.Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.",

The price is a bit more than double the Beams MB360XT, but having the ability to integrate into my Smarthome is well worth the extra cost. Also, the Ring Spotlights are twice as bright. I am not able to use Arlo cameras as motion sensors to activate the lights. One of the complaints with the Beams MB360XT is that there is not a way to change the duration and it is quite short. With the Ring Spotlights, i can set the duration within the Ring App or an Alexa routine. Also, I purchased a two pack of the Ring Spotlights that included the Ring Bridge. I did not use the Bridge and I don't see a reason to. If I did not have Alexa's with Zigbee built in, I may have needed the Bridge. I have a feeling I will be buying a few more of these.",

First I was worried using 4 D batteries would result in poor lighting, lousy performance and limited battery life. Not so.While not bright as some lights, these babies really shed light on dark areas. The motion activation is great and the Ring App notifies you when motion is detected. Despite frequent activations and constant movement monitoring, even after 2 months both lights still show 100% battery charge. Very impressive.I have been impressed with the Ring product line for years. These spotlights are a great addition to that line and well worth your consideration.",

I spent an hour on the phone with ring customer service only for them to come to the final determination that the spotlights were defective and I should return them. Amazon shipped me two new lights and both connected and work just fine. I've read other reviews that others have had similar issues. You would think that Ring would be able to figure out the issue and fix it. If you get working lights the set up process is actually pretty easy. Installation of the lights is easy as well.Pros:*If you get working lights it is easy to download the Ring app and follow the on screen instructions to set these up..*You can create groups so if you have more than one light they will both activate at the same time.*at a month in to using them the battery life still appears to be strong. I live in Minnesota and it's winter. So far the cold hasn't zapped the batteries.*installing on a wall/building is easy with the provided mounting screws.*Easy to adjust angle of the light after it's installed.Cons:*These spotlights feel like they are very cheaply made.*They seem unnecessarily bulky primarily due to the need to use 4 D cell batteries to power them.*Once the light turns on the brightness seems to fluctuate slowly. Almost like a slow flicker of the light.",

                "reviewText": "My rental house doesn't have a back porch, or an electrical outlet to plug any lights in. So I needed something either rechargeable or battery operated. This works fantastic. As soon as I come out my backdoor, it flips on, and stay on until I get down my stairs and across my yard. (Usually taking my dogs out and it's so dark). The only issue I had was trying to screw it in, the plastic guide where the screws go...makes it really hard to maneuver. I struggled getting those screws in, so it's 1/2 hanging. Hope it stays up there.",
