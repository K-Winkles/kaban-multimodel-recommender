I screwed the back into only the first two holes so that it is moved farther over on the actual door while still behind the screen. Comes with several squares of padding to cushion it nicely and its in there very secure. So happy with this purchase. There is a bit of reflection on the glass but it dosent get in the way of my view. I will see how motion goes in the next few days and report any changes but the product and install are five stars!",

                "reviewText": "The Alloy Gasket issue has been brought up a lot here but I think there is some confusion about this. Basically the Alloy Gasket is I think not supposed to stick to the screw but rather just place it there and then your supposed to place it on the door and then tighten the screw which pushes the alloy gasket and secures it in place. Unless this is how its not intended to be the instructions needs to much clear on this step and need to be written in words. Other than that this product worked great",
