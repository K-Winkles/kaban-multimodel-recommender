Alas, we discovered that while winterized, wireless buttons with batteries don't like Minnesota winters. We found this little gem that uses the motive force of the \"button\" itself to generate power and trigger the bell. Same exact idea as the battery operated button system. Arrived just in time for our first below 14F day, and operates like champ. The button is actually not a button, but a lever masquerading as a button. Would benefit from a sticker showing where to push. Ingenious design",

                "reviewText": "When we moved to our new house, we didn\u2019t realize there was no doorbell. However, our security system had a door bell system, but we had to install it on the side wall in order to wire it for use. That meant the people coming to the door wouldn\u2019t see it necessarily and would knock on the door. And if you\u2019re at the back of the house or out back, there\u2019s no way you could hear it. So getting these little stickers was a great option to put on the door which at least alerts people to look for the doorbell. I\u2019m glad it came as a three pack, because we will be painting the outside of the house and then we will have an extra one at least to put up after the clean coats of paint have been put on.",
