                "reviewText": "For a doorbell camera I tried the Google Nest doorbell Ring v2, Blink, and the Wyze model. Of all but the Wyze camera the motion detection was just awful. With both the Ring and Blink, something as small as the wind hitting my hedges in the distance (in an area I indicated as irrelevant) would set off the alarm and yet someone could pretty much walk right up and rip my door off and nothing. The Wyze doorbell selective motion detection actually works very well. The notifications are a bit delayed, but I\u2019m ok with that.What I also like about the Wyze is that the button is constantly lit blue, and the device itself was the smallest of all the ones I tested. Google was comically large, followed by ring and then blink.The field of view was best with Blink, I\u2019d say, followed by Ring and then Google. I found Wyze to have the worst field of view, but in my application this was acceptible (I only need the camera for the door, not to monitor other areas of my property as I have separate cameras for that).When cost is favored in, Wyze came out as a clear winner.",

                "reviewText": "The installation of this was a breeze! Basically, remove your old doorbell, wire this doorbell to your original doorbell wiring, wire a fuse to your doorbell chime connections inside the house, done!Obviously, follow the actual steps that Wyze has for installation, but installing this was definitely simple if you're installing this where you're current doorbell is located. In the Wyze app, when you select \"add new device\", you can select this doorbell for setup, and it will then guide you through the entire setup process for installing, and also for connecting the doorbell to the app.Once I installed the doorbell, and set it up with the app, it worked great for the first 24 hours or so until going offline. Pressing the doorbell manually didn't work either. Resetting the wi-fi didn't fix the doorbell, but resetting power to the device (flipping the breaker for the doorbell power) DID work! After a few days of flipping the breaker whenever it went offline, I found a fix for this issue. Using a toggle switch in-line with the fuse at the doorbell chime (inside the house), I was able to toggle the device off/on without having to reset the breaker to the doorbell. After using this toggle switch to reset the device a few nights in a row (after it would go offline), it stopped having this issue entirely. I probably could have contacted their support and figured out a different fix for the issue, but this worked for me.After fixing the issue I mentioned above, this doorbell has been working great! I really enjoy the video quality, and the Wyze app is smooth, and easy to use. The doorbell chime is loud, and has different sound options, which I think is a nice feature as well!Overall, for the price compared to other video doorbell systems, this Wyze doorbell seems to be a great buy! I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking to stay under the price of some of the other competitors out there.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Wyze Video Doorbell with Chime from Amazon, and I must say I'm quite satisfied with its performance. Despite its smaller size, this doorbell manages to pack a punch and gets the job done effectively.The installation process was relatively straightforward, although I did encounter a minor setback due to not having the right drilling bit for my brick exterior. However, once that hurdle was overcome, setting up the doorbell was a breeze. It took me approximately an hour, but I believe it would be quicker for someone with the proper tools.One of the standout features of the Wyze Video Doorbell is its impressive video quality. Whether it's day or night, the camera captures clear and sharp footage, allowing me to see and identify visitors clearly. Even in low-light conditions, the night vision mode performs exceptionally well.While I find the Wyze Video Doorbell to be a fantastic addition to my home security setup, I do have one concern. Given its compact size, I worry about the potential for theft or tampering. It would be great if Wyze could incorporate additional security features to address this concern.Overall, I highly recommend the Wyze Video Doorbell with Chime to others in need of a reliable video doorbell solution. Its compact design, excellent video quality, and easy installation make it a worthwhile investment for enhancing home security.I hope this review captures your thoughts accurately. Let me know if you have any further input or if you'd like me to make any adjustments.",

                "reviewText": "The Wyze doorbell does not come with a power supply/transformer so this has to be purchased separately. Installation and setup is quite easy and straight forward. The Chime unit is manufactured for the American market and therefore requires a converter socket to connect to a UK outlet, it comes with a good variety of tunes and with maximum volume selected it is very loud. The main NEGATIVE with this doorbell is that IT DOES NOT WORK WITH ALEXA IN THE UK!! It does work with Alexa in the USA and a request has been posted (approx 3 years ago now) on the Wyze Forum to apply the same upgrade for the UK but at this point in time this request has not been fulfilled. So in the UK Alexa will not tell you that someone is at the door nor will you be able to see who it is on your Alexa Show units. It is for this reason that I have given it a three star rating.",

The camera is really clear, I can talk to the person at the door and it was very easy to install. Hardwired, so no battery to change.Just one thing, there is a slight delay on my phone after the doorbell rings (maybe 2 seconds).
