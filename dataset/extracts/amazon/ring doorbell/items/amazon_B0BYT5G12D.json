Many reviewers (for other mounts) complained about the \"cheap plastic housing.\" I was just about to give up on finding an all metal mount when I ran across the Taskalo. It's all metal, easy to assemble and works perfectly. I feel that my doorbell is a little safer with a metal housing v's a plastic housing. I highly recommend giving this one a try. Thank you, Taskalo!",

                "reviewText": "This is a great idea we have a metal door in our office that we can't drill into and we didn't want to use double-sided tape cuz we wouldn't be able to get it off after so I purchased this item to hold our ring doorbell. Overall the build quality is really nice the only downside is that the screw that secures it from the bottom is too short and you need to exert some Force to get it to catch because if you just try to spend it normally you will strip it out so I ended up just finding a longer screw and putting it on there but if you can overcome that it is a pretty solid item especially for an apartment or office where you cannot damage the door",

                "reviewText": "Good fit for the Ring (2nd generation). It doesn't leave a lot of open spaces like other cases. I like the color and the modern, sleek design. The only drawback is the door c-clamp. The quality is questionable. This metal piece (including the long screw) bends to the left when I screw it on the door to tighten. So, I'm not sure if it will hold or eventually break apart when being removed/re-installed for battery recharging. Only time will tell. It's made in China so all \"long lasting\" bets are off. I'll update this review - and re-rate accordingly - in case it breaks prematurely due to normal use. I'll keep it for now since returning stuff to Amazon is a chore that I hate doing.",
