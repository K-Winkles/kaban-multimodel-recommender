                "reviewText": "I went out of my way to write a review for this transformer after searching endlessly for a compatible AC adaptor for my Google Nest Doorbell Battery version. Google has lots of documentation for the transformer for the wired next doorbell with chime, but nothing for the battery version.This transformer works perfectly with the Google Nest Doorbell, battery version. There were also no instructions so I followed another reviewer here who used it for their Ring camera doorbell and the Google Nest works the same way. Connect the two wires to the two outside posts (0V and 24V), and leave the Ground post blank. After connecting the system up this way and adding the connector provided with my Next Doorbell battery version, the app now shows that it is hardwired for power. The Nest Doorbell battery version will not record 24/7 video, even with a hardwired power connection. You need to buy the non-battery version to get that feature. However, I bought this adaptor specifically so I would no longer need to take the doorbell off to charge so it accomplished that goal.",

I suspect the old hardwire doorbell transformer got burned out from a higher voltage draw. Replacing the hardwired transformer would require cutting house power and opening the fuse panel. Instead, I simply bought this 24v transformer, added the doorbell leads to the transformer screws, and plugged it into a nearby socket. The ring doorbell has been working fine ever since.",

                "reviewText": "Needed a 24VAC transformer to power my new zone board for my AC unit. This transformers provides power to the zone board and full time power for two thermostats. It is great that it has a built in auto resetting fuse and plenty of power for multiple things at the same time. It does output slightly higher than 24V at just around 27V so make sure what you are using it for can operate at slightly higher voltages. In my case this is driving two zone damper motors, two thermostats and providing operational power to the zone board. Have had it in use now for a little over a month without any issues. I purchased the two pack to have a spare on hand. It is operating in my attic so will be susceptible to the heat of the summer and the zero degree weather of the winter. It does run warm to the touch when in use so be aware if you are using it openly in a living space. So only time will tell how it holds up to all the temperature swings and rigors of 24/7 usage.",

                "reviewText": "Installed this as previous homeowner removed the old transformer and messed up the wires. It powers the nest video door bell and chime. Very good option if you don't want to wire a transformer directly to a box or the wires are not installed in a way that makes sense to install a traditional transformer. It also has a status light which makes it easy to troubleshoot.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this for a ring doorbell. My mother didn\u2019t want to set the wiring so we are using the existing wiring in the house already and needed something that would provide 24v output to the device.I tested the device first before plugging it in as my mother got her ring doorbell for free and I didn\u2019t want to fry it. Red Lead on 0v and Black (power) on 24v. The readout was indeed AC, fluctuating from +24v to -24v with a max being +- 30v. The max the ring doorbell can take is 40v so that was great. I checked the connection of the wire for shorts and breaks (resistance) and everything was good. Set it up and it\u2019s working fine. It\u2019s perfect for my needs, though it is a bit bulky causing me to rearrange my plug but it is working and the ring doorbell is recognizing its connected to hardwire. My mother is happy and I got to use my Applied Integrated Technology degree. Win win.",
