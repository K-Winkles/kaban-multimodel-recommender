I work night shift so my wife and kids are home without me on a night and I like to be able to keep an eye on things.This video doorbell is extremely easy to set up and use. The app gives you step by step instructions to get the camera set up and connected to your WiFi.Once you have the camera set up you can install it either with the self adhesive pad or the screws and plugs provided.The camera quality is excellent and on a night it\u2019s very clear too. You can set up the notifications to alert you when there is movement which I have set up for between 23:00 and 07:00 and this feature work very well.Obviously it works as a normal doorbell too and you can plug in the chime into any USB outlet and this is perfect for us as we have USB ports in all of our main sockets.So to summarise this is a very good quality video doorbell that is cheap but good quality and works extremely well. I am delighted with this purchase and the added peace of mind I have now.",
