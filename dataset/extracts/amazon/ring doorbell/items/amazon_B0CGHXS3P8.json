It's motion sensing so depletes the battery faster than I like and I'd need to get on a ladder to switch it out. With this solar panel option I noticed that I didn't need to switch out the battery as quickly. Prior to first use, I fully charged the Ring battery. I don't rely exclusively on the solar option to charge the Ring battery, but it has helped extend the time needed before change out. Installation was straight forward. No issues.",

                "reviewText": "This solar panel works, I\u2019m not returning it, but it is inferior to the actual Ring product. The included mount is flimsy and the included cable does not have the proper weather resistant fittings for outdoor use.Luckily, I have extra cables and a better mount left over from other Ring cameras. So I will use them to make this work, rather than wait for a replacement.",
