                "reviewText": "The charger presumably was working great. The issue I ran into was the cold. The area I live in was getting very cold at night, and it looks like that was causing the battery not to charge properly, or discharge faster possibly. The battery was lasting a lot longer than it was before, without question. Though it was still draining slowly. I ended up buying a wired Ring doorbell instead and that has been working perfectly. Of course, that means no battery backup, but I will likely move the other one to another door at some point and grab another of these chargers to charge it. I would give the product 5 stars, but I just don't have a way to test if it was truly the ring doorbell, or if this was somehow not charging it fast enough. I lean more toward the doorbell, but again cannot test that, at least not quite yet.",

Have had zero issues with Ring staying powered and working.This wire was absurdly long (I don't think that's a bad thing) so I just snipped it, stripped the wires and ran it at the length I needed. The only downside to this purchase was that their wall fasteners were a little small and few in number, so maybe stop by your local hardware and get some nicer ones?",
