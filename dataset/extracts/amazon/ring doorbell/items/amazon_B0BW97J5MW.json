                "reviewText": "Kinda discovered why I could never see anything our of my Ring Door Bell (RDB) - turns out it was the light right above. Found this and it was great. Very easy to install with the RDB, looks great and the overhang blocks light at night. Having the nonslip screws is good thing if you're as clumsy as me. Only issue was when I went to change the battery out and part of the bottom blocked the release. I have a spare battery and change it when Ring says it's time. Had to clip off the bottom to make it work and it's fine. Can't see and it stays together. If you have a solar charger or it's powered other ways, it should not be an issue. I like and recommend, but keep in mind the battery swap.",
