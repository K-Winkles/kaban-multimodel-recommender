It was easy to set up and mount. I added some more foam inside the back to make sure the Ring device didn\u2019t move around inside (that\u2019s the green you may see inside the mount- in the video clip; it was a nail file thing, lol}.The mount could be slid up and down the door if pushed hard enough, that\u2019s why I placed it right above a lock to prevent it from being pushed down. But it cannot be removed from the door while outside, unless someone has a hatchet or something; so it is anti-theft. This is day 2, and the Ring 2 is working just fine. So far so Good!",

It came with everything that you needed to mount your ring camera. It has small pieces of foam cutouts that you will need to keep your ring positioned securely so that it\u2019s not moving around. Just open the device, place your ring camera inside, add the foam cutouts, replace the back, screw the screws into the backing of the item, and then place on your door by tightening it securely to your door, and that\u2019s it. It doesn\u2019t budge. Completely secured. This is great for apartments or places where you cannot drill it into the wall. This is such an inexpensive item that works so well. Highly, highly recommend!",
