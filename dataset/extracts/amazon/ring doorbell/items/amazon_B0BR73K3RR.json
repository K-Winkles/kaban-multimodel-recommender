                "reviewText": "I bought two of these. The product itself is great. It doesn\u2019t affect the motion sensor on my ring doorbell. It\u2019s great quality in terms of protecting the ring from theft. I have to give it 1 star because the screw that you use to attach the metal faceplate is so tiny that it\u2019s hard not to lose it. This product is better if your ring is wired and you dont need to keep removing the faceplate to charge the ring. I only have one screw left and the seller does not sell replacement screws. So one of my mounts are useless.",
