I think it would work very well on the right door.There is a lot of flexibility in the door width that is accounted for by the screw down fitting.On the other hand, the screw down clamp is pretty ugly on the inside of your front door.So, for the right situation, a good product.

                "reviewText": "I got this anti-theft ring doorbell mount because I liked that it\u2019s removable. There were a couple of things I liked about this when I received it. The first thing is that it\u2019s made of durable stainless steel material and the 2nd thing is it\u2019s removable and you don\u2019t have to screw it on.That being said, the things I don\u2019t like is, it\u2019s big and bulky. The main piece that goes over the door is too wide for my door and sticks out from the inside.I also had 2 issues during installation. The first issue was that one of the screws would not screw down all the way flat. I ended up stripping the screw and couldn\u2019t take it out unfortunately. This could have been a problem, had I actually put something inside the mount prior to the trial installation. The 2nd issue was the fact that I couldn\u2019t close my front door after installation. You need to ensure there\u2019s enough of a gap between the door and the door frame. You can see from the photos, mine doesn\u2019t have a gap. It appears that you need to remove the screws each time you have to recharge your camera device. This would be a hassle especially if you experience some difficulty with any of the screws like I did.The 2 main considerations prior to purchasing this anti-theft ring doorbell mount is, make sure you have a gap large enough between your door and door frame so you can close your door after installation. The other consideration is that you will have to unscrew it in order to recharge your camera device. If those don\u2019t affect you, then this might be a decent option. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work for me.",
