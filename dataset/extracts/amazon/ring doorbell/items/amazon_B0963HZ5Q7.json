                "reviewText": "We installed the doorbell button on the door frame of our covered side porch about 3 months ago using the double sided tape and it sticks very securely even in the hot afternoon sun. I plugged the chime part of the doorbell into an outlet in the center of our large single story house and we can hear the doorbell from anywhere in the house. Some people might like a louder doorbell but it suits us just fine.There are lots of options to choose from, it's easy to scroll through to choose an option or to change it any time & the volume is adjustable as well. BOTTOM LINE: The price was great, it was very easy to install, it works quite well, we're very pleased with this purchase & would recommend it to others.",

                "reviewText": "I can't believe how easy this was to \"install\" and use! You just stick the doorbell to the outside of your house (preferably in a protected area), and then plug in the base inside your house. You can change the volume to very low to really high, both parts are small, and the only thing you have to do is put the battery in the base--no electrical work or mechanical work. So much cheaper than the other doorbells on the market, too.",
