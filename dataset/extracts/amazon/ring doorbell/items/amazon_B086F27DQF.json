                "reviewText": "As a guy who loves technology but doesn't want to damage my home's walls, I was excited to try out the No-Drill Mount for my Ring Video Doorbell. I have to say, I'm really impressed with this product!The No-Drill Mount is weather-proof, durable, and uses strong non-damaging adhesive to keep my Ring Video Doorbell 3 securely attached to the wall. The setup was incredibly easy \u2013 all I had to do was adhere the No-Drill Mount to the wall and then attach my Ring Video Doorbell 3 to the mount. I didn't need any special tools or experience, which was great.Another thing I love about the No-Drill Mount is that it's easy to remove. If I need to take down my Ring Video Doorbell 3 for any reason, I can simply detach it from the mount and pull down on the adhesive strips. There's no need to worry about damaging my walls or leaving behind any residue.The No-Drill Mount is also very versatile. It's designed to work with the Ring Video Doorbell 3, Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus, and Ring Video Doorbell 4, and it's weather-resistant, which is great for someone like me who lives in an area with extreme weather conditions.Overall, I highly recommend the No-Drill Mount for anyone who wants a secure and easy-to-install solution for mounting their Ring Video Doorbell without drilling into their walls. It's durable, weather-resistant, and easy to remove, making it a great investment for anyone who wants to protect their home without damaging it. Just keep in mind that it works best on even and smooth surfaces, and it may be difficult to adhere to certain surfaces like brick or rough stucco.",

                "reviewText": "Love this doorbell holder! After purchasing a wireless Ring doorbell, the thought of drilling into my house gave me more anxiety than I needed (because I am so talented with a drill that if I tried to drill my whole house would come down \ud83e\udd23), so I decided to look for alternatives. This product didn\u2019t disappoint! I did worry about the adhesive not sticking enough and someone being able to come pull it right off, but I\u2019m fairly certain even Hulk couldn\u2019t rip this thing off my house (which causes a bit of concern when it comes to the paint on the house but oh well - you can\u2019t have it all and at the end of the day I\u2019d rather know if I\u2019m being robbed than have paint on my bricks). It was very easy to install (and I\u2019m not the brightest bulb in the bunch when it comes to putting things together - I am the person who just has to look at a manual and is instantly and completely lost), very reasonably priced, and has held up well so far. If you like your Ring doorbell but don\u2019t want to lose your house in the process, definitely try this product - You won\u2019t regret it!",
