                "reviewText": "When Ring first distributed there were no add on holder similar to this. I\u2019m happy someone created an affordable design. Well done.The solar holder option sucks for the battery operated version due to after so many charges the wire stops working due to off on with requiring the to plug in. So to continue with the battery version stuck with recharge as needed.Due to sub zero temps here began using hardwired Lorex since Ring has temp restrictions and the battery issues during winter. But, no voice. Kept using Ring to talk to the dog out back in the broken Solar mount.While scrolling discovered this gem. Bought two hoping they work as great as described. In person they\u2019re so much nicer than any other holder I\u2019ve viewed.These are so price friendly during special deals and function for our needs I\u2019m buying a third. One for the dog outback. Two for the front porch for the extra rings to keep an eye on the feral kitty condos and add a door bell for chat while maintaining the hard wire Lorex overhead surveying the property on all sides.Highly recommend this gadget. Unbelievably priced. Excellent functionality. Very easy to install. Remove to charge. Comes with everything one needs and an extra screw.Only need two to secure to the wall. The middle section isn\u2019t necessary.I used an electric screw driver. If you do, go slow so as not to strip the Philips head screw.Hope this is helpful for anyone considering this purchase.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf",

The mounting bracket is also incredibly sturdy and well-made, ensuring that the doorbell stays securely in place.\ud83d\ude80Another excellent feature of this product is its anti-theft design. The corner mount ensures that the video doorbell cannot be easily tampered with or stolen, giving me a little peace of mind.\ud83d\ude80I was also pleased to find that the mount does not block the doorbell sensor, which is a common issue with other similar products. The doorbell cover holder is designed to perfectly fit the video doorbell, ensuring that the sensor remains unobstructed.\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffcOverall, I highly recommend for anyone looking for a high-quality, sturdy, and reliable mount for their video doorbell. It provides excellent functionality, security, and ease of use, and is a great investment for anyone looking to enhance their home security.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, I would rate this as security measure to be mediocre at best. I purchased the device only as a means to add more side to side pivot to my my Ring door bell camera, which it does provide. The fun ends there, because it is immensely difficult to install the camera into the already wall mounted base using the microscopic screw located on the bottom of the mount..and the base MUST be attached to the wall first. A camera thief would not even be slowed down, because they would simply break it off the wall. Servicing the Ring battery, on the other hand, requires a surgeon's hand. and plenty of patience.The Ring doorbell camera barely squeezes into the clamshell design along with the foam cushion provided, and getting it to seat properly and close it a feat requiring more than just 2 hands. It must then be held in place while the itty bitty screw is inserted into the bottom of the unit and turned. The material is flimsy, so there will be breakage if it's just a little off and you try to use a little force to seat it.",
