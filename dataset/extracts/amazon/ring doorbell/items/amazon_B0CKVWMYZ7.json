                "reviewText": "Everything I needed and then some. I have a ring doorbell that I could hardwire, but it'd be a royal pain. I decided to look for alternatives and figured multiple batteries would do the trick. Offbrand, but these things last just as long and work just as well as the one the doorbell came with. I have yet to even use the 3rd, because it's been so easy to just swap between the original and one of these as they run out. Small charger, so fits super well anywhere. I've made my kids watch for the battery notifications and swap them out for me at this point. Huge win finding this product.",
