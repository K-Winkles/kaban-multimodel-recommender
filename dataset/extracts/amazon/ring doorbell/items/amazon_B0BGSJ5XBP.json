                "reviewText": "The description says it can be used with the Ring Doorbell 3. It is true the doorbell can be connected to it but only with modification. The mount has four holes. The bottom holes align with the bottom holes of the doorbell. The other two doorbell holes are about midway between the 4 mount holes. I had to drill out the 2 hole locations for the doorbell hole location. It's a bit of a pain but that way I didn't need new holes in the siding.",
