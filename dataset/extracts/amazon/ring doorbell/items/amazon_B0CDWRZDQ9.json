The only reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars is that the case is not locked with an anti-theft screw.",

                "reviewText": "Tried other brands and my Eufy camera would not fit but this one worked perfectly. It also comes with foam to add to side and back so camera can be placed right in the middle and not move around which is a plus. The only thing is if someone wants to take it they can by prying it off the piece where it adjusts the angle because its made of plastic and are small plastic lips that hold it . The way to avoid this is to put a screw right thru the inside once you angle the device as there is a hole inside so I installed a 2 1/2 screw thru the device inside wjere the camera sits to the wall so it can be harder to pry off the wall just in case someone gets the idea to try and steal it as I live in a apartment on the main avenue. Because I seen reviews for other devices that were antitheft but got stolen anyways. This device worked for my Eufy camera no doubt will post pics once installed and update .",

Not super dependable in my experience, sometimes it works, sometimes not.
