                "reviewText": "i had installed Ring floodlight cameras prior to installing the regular floodlights. Both the floodlight cams and regular floodlights work and integrate into the system well together. My only complaint so far (after 1 week of use) is that the installation of the regular floodlight is more tedious than the floodlight cam. My floodlight installation was complicated by a tall (second story) height. i was on an extension ladder with limited ability to reach everything easily. The main difficulty involved installing the very small fine thread machine screws that hold the unit to the base on the junction box. One has to hold the unit up in place with one hand while at the same time trying to start these small screws into a blind hole with the other. Kinda scary with no hands on the ladder up there. Very easy to do at ground level but hard on top of a second story ladder. This design should be changed somehow to make that easier for a homeowner to do and to provide more spares screws in case they tumble down to the ground (which they will). The fasteners on the floodlight cam were hex nuts that were much easier to work with.In summary i can recommend these lights for their intended purpose, but if you have an application that is on a second story or otherwise have difficulty reaching consider hiring an electrician to install them.",

                "reviewText": "I needed more lighting for taking my dog out at night. I had an existing Ring Flood Light Camera and I purchased 3 of the motion flood lights (along with the bridge) to integrate with the camera. I love that fact that I can put all of the lights in a device group and if any light detects motion all of them come on. When I first installed everything the new lights would only stay on for 30 seconds which was a little disappointing. I'm not sure if an update came out but I checked the settings the other day and I had the option to set them to 5 minutes. I wish they had the option the stay on until I turn them off manually (like I can with the Flood Light Camera) If I was working outside at night, but I am completely satisfied with the 5 minutes for now.",

They work well, but lack features that should be standard in all ring products, that feature lights. First off, the length of time, before the light shuts off cannot be adjusted above 30 seconds, unless you add the light to a \u201cgroup\u201d. This is kind of a cumbersome way to design them. Second, all of my ring cameras have an option to adjust how bright they are, except these lights. You cannot dim them, which doesn\u2019t really make any sense. I like how the lights can send motion alerts and trigger other devices with their motion sensors, like cameras or other lights, but the time between the motion sensor on the light triggering a camera to start recording is extremely slow. It takes almost 10 seconds between the motion and signal sent to the camera to actually start recording. This may not seem like much time, but I\u2019m able to walk away from the light and around the corner, and the camera never sees me. I only get a recording of after I\u2019m gone. Hopefully future improvements are made to these, to get them on par with their other devices, or even other brands out there, but after looking at the \u201cnew feature requests forum\u201d from Ring, I\u2019m not holding my breath. There are several great suggestions on there, that would be very easy for competent developers to implement, that are now going on 3 years old, and never added. All of this said, these lights work, and they work fairly well.",
