And It works !!One thing i did have to use the sticky pad, and Without the Doorbells back protector to make it fit while still being able to connect. I wasnt too concerned about rain hitting here because its covered pretty well under a canopy. With that being said, i WAS worried about the sun not hitting it directly. But we are all good there tooo !!! it was charging as soon as connected and its about 3pm at time of install.I am so relieved and happy by taking the chance. AND although there is gaps between the doorbell and the surrounding \u201cwalls\u201d of the solar house, thats just potential right there for decor ! Imagine another version of your real door down to the decor, BUT MINI \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u2728 haa so cute !Only reason why its a 4, is because of the screw driver that came with. with no tools lying around i had to use that tiny thing. Made it a bit painful for my pansy hands . But if you have your own driver, that would be fab !Edit: it is now 6/10/23 and apparently its been dead sine the 7th\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0",
