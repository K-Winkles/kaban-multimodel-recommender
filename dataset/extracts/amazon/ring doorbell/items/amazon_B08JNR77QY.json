                "reviewText": "We moved into a new home and needed some way to monitor the front porch area and the driveway. After a lot of research we chose the Ring 4, mainly for the camera roll feature which lets you see the 4 seconds prior to the notification that someone is at your door.Installation: Pretty easy but if you are mounting to siding, use something else besides the included screws. The screw heads are too small to firmly hold it to siding.Pairing with WiFi: Super easy with the App and flawless connectivity. About as simple as it can be made in terms of pairing.Picture: Generally good. The camera roll feature is far less clear than it\u2019s normal recording.Sound: Surprisingly good. The microphone is very good and I can hear everything when turned on. The two way communication works well.Battery life: Good. If you adjust the settings to avoid live updates every few minutes the battery life stretches out a lot. Battery costs are reasonable if you want a spare but they all take 6-10 hours to charge fully.Do you need Chime? Heck no. The hook up to phones is simple and many people in the house can be easily connected to the Ring 4, so why bother. People are inseparable from their phones these days anyway so no issues there. If someone is at the door all 3 phones in the house go off, so it\u2019s a no brainer!Features: More than you will need. Package notification, timers to avoid unnecessary notifications, geolocation to keep those same notifications to an area, battery health, etc. it\u2019s all there.Overall you get what you pay for. I think this was well worth the cost.",

                "reviewText": "I have went back & forth on whether or not I really needed to dish out the money for this Ring Doorbell 4, I would look up reviews and do research then I would just be like eh it\u2019s fine I don\u2019t need it that bad especially being on a tighter budget. Well income tax time hit and I seen this one was $60 off the original price & so I went for it & OMG I\u2019m sooooo glad I did! It\u2019s Amazing, I absolutely Love being able to see who is at my front door or even close to my porch I didn\u2019t screw mount mine because I live in Townhouse Apartments and I\u2019m sure that is a no no lol so I got a no screw door mount for it and it\u2019s perfect for apartment living, the camera quality is really nice, it\u2019s very fast at alerting me if someone is on or near my porch or door, it look very sleek and appealing, it came with a Ring Sticker so I got a magnet and stuck the sticker to the magnet and since my door is metal it just sticks magnetically I can remove it when I need so it\u2019s not permanent so that\u2019s an idea for you, but overall if your going back and forth like I was just get it and I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed it\u2019s awesome!! The setup was extremely fast and easy using the Ring app, it connected to myWi-Fi seamlessly with no problems I have spectrum not sure if it matters, the app loads up the camera very fast, the sound quality is great, the lights on the ring are nice and bright when they light up, overall I highly recommend this Ring Doorbell to anyone thinking of getting one, I\u2019m also going to buy a second one for my back door, also the battery seems to last really well I\u2019ve had it a few days it\u2019s only went down by 2% from 100% to 98% but I have also been fidgeting with it a lot moving it around until I got the best spot and obsessively watching the camera lol so I\u2019m sure the batter would still be at 100% if I would just be normal and stop watching it all day! I did charge the battery for about 10 hours when I very first got it just to make sure it was full charge before using it! I will buy a second battery just to always have a charged ready to go battery when the other one needs charged up :) Thanks for ready my review I hope you enjoy your new Ring Doorbell just as much as I do",

The plus points are that when they ring the bell the sound goes off at the bell and also ur phone does a door bell notification sound if you have enabled it in the app so u get the ring no matter where u are home or not. If u don\u2019t want to give anyone else access simply Combine it with the chime and u can make sure anyone hears the bell even if they are in the top floor and finally the battery life is beautiful. It does take about 6 hours to fully charge but after just one charge the battery is still at 75% after 10 days. Don\u2019t need to stress about buying an extra battery.",

                "reviewText": "This doorbell works well, and has good hardware design, but could have been easier to set up in terms of connecting to my wi-fi network, and the recommended upload speed (on the product's internet site) was not strong enough to provide a reliable connection (but changes to my home wi-fi mean I have more than triple the recommended upload speed at the doorbell location now, and it works well). While I got a Chime Pro to assist with the connection, it didn't provide any better connection strength (despite being in a better and somewhat closer location) than my modem/router, although that will vary based on the strength of signal coming from your modem/router.The phone app is good, the battery life also good (about 2 weeks, with a fair bit of motion detection and recording), the process of replacing the battery straightforward, and the information available via the app and the recordings of the videos via the Protect Plan excellent. The design and physical installation were both good, and the range of faceplates met our needs in terms of blending in with the complex. It's very handy to be able to communicate with someone who arrives at the door when I'm not in, and the customisable motion zones and pre-roll features are noticeably useful (particularly the customisable motion zones, as the doorbell faces a busy street, so being able to cover the letterbox but not the road avoids a lot of car recordings).Other than the upload speed/connection issues, other things that needed resolving during set-up (in case it helps anyone who bumps into similar):- For whatever reason, the Chime Pro (2nd edition) doesn\u2019t work with (at least my) \u2018combined\u2019 2.4GHz and 5GHz wi-fi network \u2013 I needed to split it into two separate networks for it to hook up. When it was combined, it repeatedly (and incorrectly) gave the error that the password was incorrect (and the password was checked carefully, and was fine, and worked once the networks had been split).- On a combined 2.4GHz and 5GHz wi-fi network, the Ring 4 video doorbell for some reason decided that it wanted to connect to the 5GHz signal (RSSIs from 72 to 78) rather than the 2.4GHz signal (RSSIs of 55-65, even without the Chime Pro).Working around this was a bit fiddly (made moreso by some issues on my ISP's end - but that's not a doorbell issue), but once everything was set up, it works very well, and is a great product.",

                "reviewText": "Initially our nbn/internet would not link our football 4 into our network. However, after several attempts it is now linked into our system and works extremely well. I get a notification if someone rings our doorbell and I can see them on my phone. It also allows us to see people going past through the motion sensor. I am about to try and use the microphone to speak to visitors when we are away. This can be done through the doorbell. I just haven\u2019t got around to doing this at this point in time, but I will. Very happy with this product. Gives us added security as we already have a security system installed, with video capturing facilities.",
