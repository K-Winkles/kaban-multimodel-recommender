All of this is accomplished without sacrificing the structural integrity of my door. The Ring Doorbell can't be tampered with or stolen since the mount comes with a reliable locking mechanism that comes standard. When you live in a neighborhood where there are periodic thefts from porches, having this additional layer of protection is a wonderful benefit. Because of the mount's sturdy design, I am certain that it will be able to survive any efforts at tampering and will thereby provide an additional layer of safety for my house. Because the mount can be adjusted to a variety of angles, I am able to set the Ring Doorbell for maximum coverage, which ensures that every nook and cranny of my entry is monitored. The mount's streamlined and inconspicuous form allows it to blend in completely with my door, which improves the appearance of the space as a whole without calling unwanted attention to itself.",

The description said it was designed to \"fully protect your wireless video doorbell, preventing theft and safeguarding your property\"Unfortunately that is not the case. the actual housing is made of plastic. It's a decent thickness but the weak point is the 4 press in nuts that hold it to the back plate. This could EASILY be ripped off the door without the use of much force.I will be looking around for an all metal one as I do not want to risk losing my doorbell.",

                "reviewText": "Sometimes just having a camera isn't enough people will still try and steal it. After loosing 2 doorbell cameras I decided a locking case is my best bet to keep my camera safe. This was easy to install with no drilling required. This will keep porch pirates away because they can't just snatch it and run away without getting caught. It can be adjusted perfectly to your door frame and it secures inside the house so to remove it they will have to break it or open your front door.",
