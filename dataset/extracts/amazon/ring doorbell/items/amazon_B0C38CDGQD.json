So I searched Amazon for something to use so that I didn't have to continuously take down my ring doorbell to charge, because let's just say that defeats the purpose of having it, right? So I eventually came across this solar charger for it, and couldn't be happier. I mean this thing works awesome and is so simple to put on, & also has an adjustable solar panel, so that u can move it up or down to set it in the right spot to get enough sun . So if ur looking for a quick, easy, and not so expensive choice to keep ur video doorbell recording at all times then this device is for u, & I promise you won't regret it. Definitely worth every penny, and very happy I went with this product.",

                "reviewText": "There was a few days we didn\u2019t have hardly any sun and the battery kept draining. I took the ring bell off and the little piece that goes into the back of the doorbell to charge it broke off. I called Amazon and they sent me out a replacement. I plugged the back piece in, and it didn\u2019t show it was charging by the solar so I unplugged it and then the piece broke off again. Called Amazon again, they said they couldn\u2019t do a replacement but can do a refund. I\u2019m going to try to order it again and see what happens. I really love the concept of this and when it was working, it was doing a good job. The battery was draining on the faster side because I had the motion sensitivity all the way up. Never knew how busy my street was until I had this. I really want this to work so I can keep my motion detection on all the time because of the neighborhood I live in. Has this happened to anyone else?? Maybe third times a charm?UPDATE: After the piece broke I contacted Amazon and they replaced the unit. It came in the next day and the same piece broke off. Called Amazon again and they refunded me and I decided to buy an another one. Am I a sucker? Maybe but I truly love the concept of solar charger. Got the other one in and so far so good. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffbThere were DAYS we had no sun and I had to bring it in to charge the doorbell but that\u2019s understandable.I love this product and even though I\u2019ve had a few issues, I still recommend it. Also, their customer service is spectacular! They address your concerns and get back to you just about immediately.Will be ordering another one soon",

                "reviewText": "Before the arrival of the Ring Doorbell Solar Charger, I was a mere mortal, chained to the mundane routine of recharging my Ring every 10 days, as if paying homage to the gods of electricity. Then, as if by magic (or perhaps clever engineering), along came this solar marvel, lifting the burdensome yoke from my shoulders.This isn't just a solar charger; it's a ticket to freedom. It's like having your own personal sun, dedicated solely to keeping your Ring doorbell juiced up and vigilant. The days of plugging and unplugging, of watching battery levels like a hawk, are now just whispers of a bygone era.Quality? Stellar. Performance? Unfaltering. My Ring has been basking in the solar glow for months now, standing guard without a single complaint. It's as if it's found its sun-soaked utopia, and the thought of returning to its dark days of dependency on mere electricity is unthinkable.So, I bestow upon this device a glorious 5-star review, not just for its undeniable utility, but for the sheer joy of never having to charge my Ring manually again. Here's to the Ring Doorbell Solar Charger, the unsung hero of my smart home setup. May its",
