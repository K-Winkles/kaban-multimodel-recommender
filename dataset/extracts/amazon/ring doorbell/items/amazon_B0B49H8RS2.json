                "reviewText": "Love this camera. It didn\u2019t come with any instructions or charger box (did come with cord) but I went online and figured out that I had to remove the batteries initially and take the plastic sticker off the end of each battery before I could charge them. It took a a couple of hours but I have had it working for three weeks now and it is only gone down to 55% battery life. Also pairing the chime with the doorbell was easy. Just make sure they are close to each other when pairing. Definitely would recommend this product!",
