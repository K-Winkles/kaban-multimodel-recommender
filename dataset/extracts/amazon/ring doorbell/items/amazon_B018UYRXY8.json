                "reviewText": "Works as described and better. Bought 6 of these for apartments in our reinforced concrete buildings. No problem with signal. Closest unit is within 50 feet range, and furthest unit is at about 400 feet distance from the push buttons. All untits work well. Don't know about life-span of batteries, but will update review in the future. These things saved me a ton of money by avoiding hard wired installation costs. I spent roughly $ 120 for these 6 units and installed them myself. (Not very complicated). By comparison, hardwired door bell installation cost in our buildings would have been somewhere near $ 1500. (Ouch) These push-button sender units are very easy to install with a regular cordless drill and screwdriver. The adhesive pads that come with the unit did not work too well for me. The adhesive came loose in the heat, so I used screws instead to anchor the pushbuttons on a wood board. Had to drill two small holes into each pushbutton unit (see photos). Not a big problem, since the plastic is not too strong and can be drilled easily. The pushbutton unit has two clearly marked locations where the holes need to be drilled. I used a 1/8 drill for my own screws, not the ones supplied with each unit because they were too long for my assembly. The receivers just plug into an electric outlet and have adjustable tone and volume controls. (Can't get much easier than that) Battery replacement is as easy as changing flashlight batteries or batteries in a computer mouse. We installed the 6 push-buttons in a small wood enclosure to protect them from rain and excessive sun exposure. My worst fear is vandalism because the plastic push-button units can be destroyed easily with a hammer or rock by people who thrive on mischief or have maybe had too much alcohol in their system. Maybe these outside push-buttons can be manufactured with a more durable metal, thicker plastic or fiberglass enclosure. (Just saying) However, a metal enclosure may interfere with the signal strength. In summation, I'll be happy if I can get at least one year of service out of each unit. They can be replaced at minimal cost.",

                "reviewText": "Purchasing Cause:Looking to replace a doorbell that was in need or repair. Seemed this would be a more efficient option with the wireless technology and the seemingly easy install.Shipping (Prime Member):No issues with the shipping. Product was received in the standard 2 day free delivery service offered to Prime members.Shipping Packaging:Packaging for the product was great, no issues detected.1st Inspection of the Product After Receiving:Product was in great condition, no noticeable defects and came with clear instructions with the install. Also had a template for drilling the holes for the door bell button, which was a nice ease feature.1st Use of the Product:Product is great. It has a lot of different sounds to choose from as well as a wide variety of volume control to fit your desired sound. Very convenient since there are no wires involved and all you need is a battery for the button (which was included) and a outlet to plug the receiver into.Was the Product Returned?:This product wasn't returned and I still use this product to this day.Overall Pros:* Great cost* Easy Install* Wide variety of sounds to use as a ringer* Easy controls and clear instructions on how to use the productOverall Cons:* The highest volume could be louder. The highest volume on this doorbell works great if you're not to far away from it to hear it, but I would like to have it be able to be a little louderIn Closing:Excellent product overall. Easy to install and I love all the variety sound options available. 4/5 for a great product, however I do wish the product would have a higher volume ring setting. In my house the volume works pretty well, however in certain rooms it's very hard to hear the doorbell.",
