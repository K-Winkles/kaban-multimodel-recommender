                "reviewText": "I have been looking for some type of protective cover for my Reolink video doorbell. When I saw the dgyezhao Rain Doorbell Cover I decided to give it a try.PIC1 (I have labeled each picture in the upper right corner because they never appear in the order I add them to the review) shows what you get. This includes the cover itself, some mounting hardware, a screwdriver and short manual.The manual is basically one page folded. One side talks about installing the cover using glue or the included hardware (screws). The other side has some information on the cover itself.In my case installation was very simple. I just put the cover over the doorbell. To do this I put the open end of the cover over the top of the doorbell and it easily slid down along the side of the doorbell. My doorbell is a Reolink (if any of you have that one) so you will know that it will fit. Once the cover is in place I put two screws with one on each side (in the holes in the cover) into the wall. I could not put a screw in the top center hole because of the way my doorbell is mounted. To drive the screws I used my cordless drill. The only problem I had was that the first screw I drove snaped off the head of the screw when it got tight. This slightly complicated driving the new screw because the body of the broken off screw was in the position where I wanted to put the new one so I had to put that side a bit over from where I would have wanted it to go. Luckily I was only going to use two of the three provided screws. I still used my coreless trill but only drove the screws to close to being tight and used the provided screwdriver to tighten the rest of the way.PIC2 shows the final installation. PIC3 shows the view out of the camera with the cover in place. Note that you can see the rectangular notch in the upper center of the picture. The shade portion of the cover does block a little bit of the image as you can see. I have also provided PIC5 which shows the same view without the cover in place. You can compare the two to better understand what gets blocked. Your view will depend on the lens of the doorbell camera (i.e. its angle of view).This is a very simple product and easy to install. It is made out of metal (steel in the Amazon product title). The Amazon product description also says it is \"explosion-proof\". This will be the only part of my house that is explosion-proof so I'll be sure to stand behind that cover in the hall in case of an explosion. It does feel very rugged though. If you are looking for a protective cover for your video doorbell you should consider the dgyezhao rain doorbell cover. It will get the job done!",

                "reviewText": "This product does as advertised...It block light glare from my porch light and protects camera from rain. It's well made of decent metal and a good matte black finish.THE BIG OVERSIGHT (on my end) is to charge my camera, I have to unmount it via a clip on the top of it. With this hood, I cannot access it without removing everything. Luckily it's on a pain to do so every few months.",
