So in anger one of these past times in having to change the batteries for the umpteenth time I put it back on my door a little too aggressively breaking all the plastic hooks on the original backing. Then I was even angrier at myself for breaking it and thinking I was going to have to buy a whole new doorbell. Until I thought about just replacing that one part. I'm so glad I did. These backings came the next day, were a great price, and are better quality than the original.",

                "reviewText": "Every time I replace the battery I forgot how to remove the Blink doorbell camera after inserting the pin... because after inserting the loosely fitted pin it does nothing... it isn't like you feel a click and it unlocks the blink doorbell from the backplate, nooooo you wiggle it and wiggle it.... and nothing.... then you look it up on the internet, push in... and lever it upwards..... crack.... or once the whole blink doorbell goes flying!! I am fairly sure that this design with tiny hook pins are intentional because why else do we have this product... Blink Doorbell Backplate Replacement, Back Plate Part Compatible with Blink Vi... not sure if I should stock up because I think we need a few boxes of these backplates lying around just in case we break the back plate with every change of the batteries. Anyways I had been taping my blink doorbell onto the frame with moving tape for the last year or so and now with the purchase of the Blink Doorbell Backplate Replacement, Back Plate Part Compatible with Blink Vi, once again my Blink Doorbell is installed correctly without tape. PS. If you own the angular blink mount the middle mounting screws to the angular mount are different as I dropped the screw and I thought no problem I got some new screws in the box, but no, they are different. So half hour later I finally found the angular mount screw, thank goodness as I was thinking another year of tape mounted blink doorbell. Anyways this product Blink Doorbell Backplate Replacement, Back Plate Part Compatible with Blink Vi is a valuable product that goes hand in hand with the blink doorbell and I am glad that I found it.",

Installation was pretty easy. Took me less than 5 minutes with a Phillips screwdriver. Happy there's a second one too in case a replacement is needed later on.",
