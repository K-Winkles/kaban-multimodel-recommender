I love that it\u2019s more of a heavy aluminum/ metal material and not some flimsy plastic, makes me think it\u2019s very durable but only time will tell. The sizing was a perfect fit and it has a very sleek and pretty appearance that was personally pleasing! Thank you seller for your quality product!",

                "reviewText": "As written by other folk, the location of my original doorbell switch faced the opposite wall. Not good. So I gave this RIOVO Adjustable 30 to 55 Degree Doorbell Angle Mount a try. Keep in mind it does have 6 holes for your Ring doorbell (3 at the top, 3 at the bottom) as a type of universal mount, depending on what model you have. The only 'problem' I had was that the 2 holes on the base that screw into the wall did not line up at all with the 2 holes (with already installed anchors from the original switch) that were already in the wall. Rather than drill 2 new holes in the concrete block wall, and then install 2 new anchors, I took the old switch, placed it in the correct position on the base, used a small nail to mark the holes, and drilled 2 new small holes (carefully, it's only plastic) that would line up with the already installed holes/anchors. Had a little trouble pairing the doorbell (not included) with the new ring chime (not included) with Android phone. Had to completely start over at one point. But we just YouTubed it and now everything works GREAT!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my Eufy 2k battery powered video doorbell. I needed a wedge that was bigger then the 15 degree one included in the box. This allows for a 35 to 55 degree degree angle. It works with the mount included with the eufy video doorbell and I suspect would work for any eufy video doorbell. The only draw back is there is a little gap between the eufy mounting piece and the wedge but it is not large and it is not a big deal. If it bothers someone they can seal it in several different ways. Installation was easy and I would recommend this product for anyone needing a larger wedge for a eufy video doorbell without hesitation.",

                "reviewText": "My RIng Pro button disintegrated and, as a Ring Wired is so cheap, I decided to go for the easy option and jut buy a new Ring Wired. The Ring Wired is smaller than a Ring Pro, so would've meant drilling new holes in the wall to mount it. However, I noticed this mount had the screw holes in the same place as the Ring Pro, yet would allow you to mount a Ring Wired to it. I also wanted a mount to angle the doorbell away from the wall. So this mount seemed perfect.It was easy to install and did line up with the previous Ring Pro holes. The Ring Wired screwed to the mount easily and some supplied tape covered the exposed parts at the top and bottom of mount and looked better than I thought it would.The quality of the mount is good and seems sturdy and well made. The thing to be aware of it that it would be easier for a thief to steal your doorbell. The Ring doorbells have an anti-tamper screw to hold the cover in place. This mount has no such thing, so you could remove the mount from the wall (along with your doorbell) with a standard screwdriver. Hopefully the button on RIng Wired will last a bit longer.",
