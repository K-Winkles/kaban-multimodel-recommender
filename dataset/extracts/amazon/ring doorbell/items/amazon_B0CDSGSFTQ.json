And I wasnt ready to pop out my peephole for that specific Ring option. My only issue is that my door jamb wasn't 100% accommodating to the device at first but a little Vaseline and I've gotten it to work better. It's easy to take off and on to recharge the Ring. Happy w my purchase to give me added security to my place.",
