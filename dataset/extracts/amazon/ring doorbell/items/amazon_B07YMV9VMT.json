                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great alternative to Ring/Nest doorbells - great Apple integration!",
                "reviewText": "For reference, I am a tech guy, and do smart home integrations, and was looking for something for my own home. I've owned Nest products (Google) and had a Ring doorbell on my previous home. While those products are great, I was looking for something with a little better Apple integration, and also, something where my data wasn't going to Ring/Google for my cloud recordings.I did a lot of research and stumbled upon Arlo. While it's not a very large company, it's a growing company and has focused a lot of its products on integrating with Apple (homekit/video/etc).A few thoughts on the installation/setup process:- Install - The install on this was very simple, and comparable to Ring/Nest. A couple of things to note:(1) Arlo is NOT battery powered. You can get battery powered Ring doorbells, so keep that in mind.(2) You need 16-24V of power. Some older doorbell transformers may not have that, so check before you buy.(3) You need to install a power kit. It's not complicated, but you do need to install a power kit on the chime unit of your doorbell. The instructions to do so are dead simple, but just be aware of that- Shape - Note that the Arlo doorbell is skinnier than some of it's competition. As a result, I was left with a hole behind the mounting plate when I installed the doorbell. Ultimately, it wasn't an issue, as I just filled in the hole with spray insulation and clear caulk, but it was an added step I wasn't expecting- Setup - The setup was dead simple. The app walks you through everything. It failed to pickup wifi the first time (I live in FL and have impact glass), but then I just opened the front door and everything worked.- Usage - My wife and I love this. If we get someone at our door, it just calls us, and starts with an audio call (in case we are in bad cell phone reception), and then, if we want to see video, we have the option to push a button, and get live video. The video quality is high, and crystal clear. Also, the motion alerts are crisp (you can turn on zones, just like Ring).- Cloud - The one thing I don't love about Arlo is that to get cloud recording, you have to pay their subscription. The subscription fee. It's $3/month, but it enables 2K recording and also allows you access to features, like face detection. I'm still not sure if I will continue using the cloud subscription, but I have it for a 3 month free trial.- Customer Service - While I didn't need this during setup, I did call customer service on an unrelated matter, and they were knowledgeable, friendly and picked up fast. AMAZING!@Arlo - If you are reading this - Please consider HomeKit Secure Video integration. That would just be the cherry on top of an otherwise great product.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Generally a good video doorbell with some caveats",
                "reviewText": "First, the installation was pretty straight forward. The app with the included video are very good and easy for even non-technical people. One issue is that to complete the setup, you get a QR code on your phone which needs to be viewed and accepted by the doorbell camera. In direct sunlight, its a challenge to get it to see the QR code.The app is easy to use but requires tweaking to set it so that it doesn't send a notification with every detected motion. There is also a few seconds (~5 sec.) between the when the person at the door is speaking, and hearing on the app. There is also a delay for the person at the door to hear my response.After 3 weeks, there was a problem with the doorbell speaker audio. I could hear the sound outside (from the microphone) perfectly, but my voice via the app to the doorbell speaker was garbled and distorted. I eventually got through to a technical support person via online chat, after explaining the problem to the automated assistant, then again to a non-technical human, and a third time to the tech support person. He walked me through power down the doorbell (transformer circuit), removing the device from my app, then removing the doorbell from the mounting bracket and doing a factory reset, then adding the device again via the app. This took about an hour but it did fix the sound issue at least for the time being. I'm hoping this doesn't happen again or I will request a replacement.",
