                "reviewText": "They fall in the cracks of the deck, so I have to but these a lot. But I love the price and everything tou need.But I think the ring screws should be magnetic. I just need the screws, I love is, cheap and same stuff, but evert8me I carge it, I put a puppy pad down cause a have a wood deck, so you drop the bottom screws, not goid. Even with puppy pad down, they bounce. I realize now, you unscrew is ( underneath is an odd way to unscrew) you gotta loosen them, than hand unscrew them, but no slippery fingers, they'll fall right out. I've never seen just screws to hold it in. A handful for a years, I see other reviews say the same thing, so please ring, thank Amazon for these, but we loose the SCREWS, usually the rest is back in the box.Everything fits, easy to use, same exact things in ring. Well worth the $2!! My problem is with ring and their screws, the should add 2 replament screws for some of os who drop them!",

I was upset I had to pay for the replacement screws when they should have been in the original box, but this was just what we needed. So thankful they sell these and so affordable!!",
