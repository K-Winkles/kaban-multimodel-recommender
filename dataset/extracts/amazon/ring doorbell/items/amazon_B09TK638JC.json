It fits at the top, but leaves the video sideways and harder to reach. I think this would be a lot more user-friendly if it could rotate for either door side or top mounting and offered a longer bar if mounted from the top. Otherwise, it seems great. I'm kind of sorry I have to return it.",

                "reviewText": "Got this for peace of mind and wouldn\u2019t trade it. Would love it the battery life was longer when recording longer sequences. So far I think it works fine. Love the ring community it comes with that\u2019s a nice surprise to know what\u2019s going around within a certain vicinity. I couldn\u2019t give it a 4.5 because of the battery but overall product gets it done. Maybe best to get a second battery",
