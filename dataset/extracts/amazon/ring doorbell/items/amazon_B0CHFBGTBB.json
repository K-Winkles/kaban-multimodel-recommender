Can recorded footage be stored in the cloud? Cloud service subscription is necessary for storing videos, with a trial offered for free. No charges will occur during this period, if you're not pleased, you can freely cancel during the trial if it doesn't fulfill your needs. Is the doorbell camera designed to work on 5GHz Wi-Fi? The doorbell camera can connect only to 2.4GHz Wi-Fi. If your router provides both 2.4GHz and 5GHz, ensure they're named differently and connect to the 2.4GHz network. Do I need an SD card with this doorbell camera? This doorbell camera doesn't need an SD card. It has cloud storage with a free trial. Is the doorbell camera quick to install? Yes, just follow the simple manual.",
