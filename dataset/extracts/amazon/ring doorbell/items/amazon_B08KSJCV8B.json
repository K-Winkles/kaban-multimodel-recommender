                "reviewText": "My initial experience with this product was poor, as editorialized below. However, within a day of posting this review I received an email from Ring customer support. The service representative, Ryan (great guy!) walked me through some steps to see if we could get these lights to reboot and do what they were supposed to do, but after doing everything we could, the lights just didn't want to cooperate.Ryan then sent me two brand new lights, and they both work BEAUTIFULLY! They have been holding their charge for over a week now, recharging via solar during the day. They are very bright at night and do a great job of illuminating the area where I placed them. Best of all is the customer service I received from Ring. As I said, Ryan was absolutely great and did everything he could to resolve my issue. Add to that, I received another email from Alexis to follow up while Ryan was out. Great tag team work there!Products will fail from time to time and that's to be expected. I never expect a failure in customer service, though, and Ring did not disappoint. Top notch customer service and complaint resolution! Thank you, Ring!I love the brightness of this light and how easy it is to install, plus the fact that you can add an additional solar panel to it if you want more charging capabilities. However, you have to have the light in full sun during the day to completely recharge the batteries. If you have it set up in even partially shaded area the batteries will not fully recharge. In order to address this I purchased an additional solar panel, which IS in full sun for the entire day, but I still don't get a full charge on the batteries by nightfall.In addition to that, the battery life is horrible. I do not have the light on all night. It is set up to light up when it detects motion and to turn off after 3 minutes. The motion isn't activated that often, so there's really no reason for the battery to be drained in the morning. I'm also perplexed as to why they chose to go with these wimpy batteries when the batteries for the spotlight cams have such great battery life and can be pulled and replaced with a freshly charged battery. If I want to recharge the battery quickly I have to pull the whole assembly from the fence to recharge inside.I regret this purchase completely and I'm very disappointed in Ring. This is the first thumbs down review I've given on any of their products.",

                "reviewText": "If you are already a Ring Bridge user for lighting control this product is a no brainer. I have it on the back of my house to light up a small lawn. Works great. I wanted something to provide light on the lawn but nothing too bright such as a RIng Spotlight or Floodlight cam. It is just this light and a couple Ring Pathway lights and it is a good amount of light for my lawn to walk around. I didn't even bother to precharge it with a USB. I just installed it, batteries started with about 45%. It gains about 15-20% charge a day with the built in solar panel with 3-4 hours of direct sun, after 2 days it is already near 80% charge so I don't think I will ever need to take it down and usb charge it. I have it on motion control and it uses about 1-5% in the evening depending on how much motion it detects. Like other Ring lights the motion detection on this can be used to supplement motion detection on Ring cameras. Install is a simple bracket with 2 screws and the light then just slides onto the bracket. It's too new to speak on durability but so far it is a perfect solution for what I needed at a reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "EDIT: Ring reached out to me after I wrote the review below and after some very extensive trouble shooting including a factory reset and a forced firmware update, we were able to get the device working properly and it now does what I need - it detects my dogs in the yard and stays lit. It\u2019s quite bright. My only minor issue now is that the solar panel is having trouble keeping it charged, probably because I live in Pittsburgh which is not known for its sunny weather. I don\u2019t mind bringing it in and charging it every once in a while and I imagine it will do fine when the days are longer come summer.Original review:I bought this so I could see my dogs when they go outside after dark. It simply doesn\u2019t work - it detects motion but won\u2019t turn on unless paired with my ring doorbell. When I paired it with the doorbell, it won\u2019t turn on for longer than a minute after the doorbell detects motion no matter how many times I adjust the settings to try and keep it on for for longer. Even if I manually turn it on with the 15 minute setting, it still turns off after one minute. My dogs aren\u2019t such overachievers as to reliably do their business in 60 seconds or less, so I\u2019ll be looking for other options to light their potty zone.",
