                "reviewText": "Our previous keypad was over 8 years old and not working properly anymore so, it was finally time to replace it.I am pretty handy when it comes to having to replace certain things in the house, but I was not super confident if I could install this. But it had to be done and after following a YouTube video on how to install it (I personally do better with video instructions than image ones if I can find it), I was able to replace it successfully. It was easy to change the code and unlocks/locks well.My only small nitpick is that I am not a fan of the two beep noises it makes even when opening and closing the door from the inside. But that really is the only con and hopefully I will get use to it. Overall though, great price and works well!",

I wish more color options were available, but it is fine.",
