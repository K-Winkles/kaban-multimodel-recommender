                "media_text": "How long does the doorbell camera work on one full battery? On average, the doorbell camera's battery endures 1 to 3 months on one charge, but frequent recording and consistent Live View usage can drain it more quickly, requiring sooner charging. Does the doorbell camera provide cloud storage for its video recordings? To save videos, you'll need to subscribe to a cloud service, starting with a free trial. During this period, you won't be charged, and the subscription will automatically begin post-trial unless you decide to cancel it without cost if unsatisfied. Does the doorbell camera support connection to 5GHz wireless networks? This doorbell camera is designed to be used with 2.4GHz Wi-Fi only. If you have a dual-band router, differentiate the networks by name and attach the camera to the 2.4GHz network. How many users can simultaneously access the doorbell camera's live feed? The primary user can share the device with eight others. While three people can view the video feed at once, only one person can use the intercom. How do I set human detection to ensure longer battery life for my doorbell camera? Frequent motion in your camera's view, like kids playing, can wear out the battery. Set human detection to high accuracy to reduce this and conserve power.",

                "reviewText": "It's a nice little camera. It has a good battery life and was easy to mount to our door frame. We can have more than one person signed which is really helpful. Our complaints are that has a tendency to sign us out of the app or will disconnect from the internet. We have to sign back in in order to get notifications. It still works, it just won't notify us. It also has a few moments lag for notifying when someone is at our door. If they ring the doorbell we hear it. If not we don't always get notified right away. Other than that we like it.",
