                "reviewText": "So, I bought two of these bad boys for our apartment since we have a front and back door to our unit. For the price, you can\u2019t beat the quality and functionality! My only complaint would be the battery life, but based on how well this item works for the price-point, I can see why the battery life is lacking. The motion sensor is very active, even on low, which is a good thing because that means it\u2019s doing it\u2019s job to alert you. I set the proximity range to low, and the humanoid detection mode to high, which supposedly drops recording sensitivity down until the unit is confident that there\u2019s an actual person within range vs an animal, or another object. So far, the unit has used anywhere from 7-10% battery per day, depending on the activity level at my complex. Do the math and that\u2019s somewhere between 10-14 days of usage on a full charge. You might say that\u2019s not too shabby, which it isn\u2019t, but considering that it takes nearly that long to charge back up when it\u2019s fully drained, it\u2019s worth pointing out. My only other issue is more of a suggestion for the manufacturer, and that is, please make a model with an SD card option so the user subscription is optional. I\u2019d rather pay more upfront and have the ability to record and erase my own data vs putting it on a cloud network. Video/ Picture quality is pretty darn good, especially at night in low-light environments. Overall, I\u2019m happy with the purchase and would buy it again. I\u2019d also recommend this item to anybody looking for an entry-level, budget-friendly doorbell security cam. The product comes with simple directions, is easy to install, and has some nice features, such as: night vision, screenshot, landscape view and 2-way intercom. I like that they provide you screws and double sided tape for the mounting housing too. This gives the user a means to secure the housing two ways, depending on what\u2019s best for your particular application. You can even use both if you really want to secure it down. I also like that you can easily share access with family members by email invite or QR code. If you\u2019re in the market for some added security, looking to enhance to your outdated doorbell, or simply would like to put a face to the visitor, then look no further! This blows a lot of other higher priced competitors out of the water, the reviews speak for themselves.",

In my area there has been someone breaking into cars and stealing things off our porches. This really helps me to make sure that my car and property is ok and has a motion detection feature that will help me to catch the person who has been causing this problem. It really is great and useful for those who have a disability or even a hard time getting up to check who is at the door. You can simply check through the app on your phone or tablet to see who is there without getting up. I'm really thankful for this item. It has really helped me so much.",

Signal is great and I love the quality of video and sound recording.The battery charge lasts several days with high volume usage. Only need to charge it on the weekends when the office is closed. The system also notifies you via app or website when there is activity at the door or when the battery is running low.I work at multiple offices, so being able to check my camera even when I am across town is extremally helpful. I am also able to tune into the mic when a client is at my door, to answer their questions or provide them a time of when I will be returning. This is a definite must have for any home owner or business. And with this price, you cant get a better deal.",

                "reviewText": "The video quality on this is good however, it\u2019s not really worth the money.Immediately after I charge it to 100% it will randomly drop down to 75% within 30 minutes. It will then stay around 70% and go up and down on its own without me charging it.It does not capture everything. I live in an apartment, and my neighbors door is next to mine. It\u2019s like a 90 degree angle, so I can see their door completely through the camera. The camera will sometimes record them going to their door, and other times it doesn\u2019t capture them at all. Even though it\u2019s is literally right in front of the camera. Makes me worried that someone could easily sneak up to my door without the camera ever catching them.Any time it sends an alert that someone is at the door, they are already gone by the time I get it. This camera only captures people right before they go out of frame. Pretty much defeats the purpose.*UPDATE*Customer service reached out to me after my review. They gave me a full refund since I was having issues, which was nice.The battery of the camera seems to have mostly fixed itself. It no longer drops down to 70% after charging, it stays charged for the most part now.It does still have issues with catching things in the frame on time, but it does notify me if someone is at my door.Also, they have a 30 day free trial for the cloud storage so that\u2019s nice.Overall this camera isn\u2019t too bad if your on a budget.",
