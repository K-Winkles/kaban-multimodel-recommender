Even if your door bell is facing straight down the walkway coming to the door a slight angle gives you a much better image of the people walking to the door. The better you can center the ring camera lens where the people walk the better image your going to get, doing this seems to really help at night giving you a much clearer image.A must for just about any ring door bell owner!",

Great idea but wasn't thought out very well. If you make a product to fit another product, EVERYTHING should work with it.",

                "reviewText": "If you have a ring pro and decided you need you camera angled a bit as most do when it comes to this doorbell you may want to read first..The kit itself is nice for the price. ButIf you\u2019ve already installed your ring pro. Then you\u2019ve probably already drilled holes in your wall and used rings installation kit with the nice black back plate with level in it..Well with this kit you have to do some simple modifying.. First you have to get the plastic angle plates and screws to line up correctly with your existing holes you drilled in your wall. Not hard at all. Just hollow out the angle plates screw holes slightly bigger and straight to give your screws some free play when relining everything back up. (The angle plate screw holes are angled) Then the heads of the screws this kit came with are slightly bigger and won\u2019t fit rings mounting screw holes. (If forced they will break or crack the ring doorbell housing and may throw off the sealed camera to a whole new angle) Simply grind the heads down slightly till they fit with ease. Or find longer screws with the same size head as provided with your ring pro doorbell. After that the ring doorbell, angle plate(s) and rings back plate will all line up using the same hole as before..OrIf you don\u2019t mind redrilling your holes and having the old holes exposed or have to fill them, then you can skip that step above. I personally didn\u2019t want that. Or if you have NOT installed your ring pro yet then you can skip this all together. But I don\u2019t think you can use the nice leveling back plate that came with you ring with this kit either.. Hope this helps everyone.",
