Fortunately, I found a perfect alternative to the doorbell button on Amazon. It's not a rough 3D-printed product, and they thoughtfully included two replacement screws needed when changing the doorbell button. Following a YouTube video, I easily completed the process of replacing the doorbell button, and it fits just like the original device. I believe their service is impeccable.",
