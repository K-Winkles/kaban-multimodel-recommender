Wait 12 to 24 hours, the worse the burn the longer you keep it covered. I burned my whole hand one time from a radiator cap that blew off because the engine was very overheated, probably 300 degrees, the top of my hand was on fire literally that is what it felt like, I took a plastic glove, put ointment in each finger in the glove, then covered my hand with the ointment, used the whole tube, put the glove on my hand and 24 hours later I removed it! My hand was normal, no blisters, no redness, no nothing but a normal hand. I have burned myself in the kitchen, a finger, really bad, apply ointment, put glove on, till the morning, remove glove, nothing, no blisters, no nothing. Best Burn Ointment in the Universe. Nothing Better!!!!!",

One day I gave a tube to a mom whose daughter had a rash on her neck from some dye in her shirt. 20 minutes later the red was gone from her neck and her daughter was running around playing. I have been using it for at least 40 years and it was not new when my mother-in-law recommended it to me. I have given dozens of tubes away because it is no longer available in the stores and Blistex does not advertise it. I am just glad it is still available to purchase. It can be ordered through your local pharmacy or from Amazon. I buy six tubes at a time!",

My son is a chef, and he keeps it on hand! My only complaint is that they no longer make the spray, which was wonderful to have for sunburns! If you have kids, you are going to want to have this in your first aid kit! I do recommend that if you are using it on a place that you can't cover with a band-aid, use a dedicated shirt or bottom as this can stain. But I can live with the stains not to have pain or scars!",
