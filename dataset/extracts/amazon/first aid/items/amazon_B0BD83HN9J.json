I'm happy with my selection and hope I never need it!",

                "reviewText": "I'll start out by saying I'm overall very happy with this purchase, and will be ordering more. I love the first aid bags that have lots of compartments so things aren't just flying around in the bag all willy-nilly. For the price I paid, I feel like I got a great deal. If I had paid more for the kit, I would have been disappointed, but they have their price point in the right place. As others have mentioned, it is a cheap kit. I always \"edit\" my first aid kits to fit my needs anyway, which includes replacing the bandages that they come with, with bandages that I prefer. I also always add Benadryl, ibuprofen (or other analgesic), triple antibiotic ointment, and a neatly folded plastic shopping bag to serve as a waste bag, none of which this kit came with. I have seen a lot of other reviewers wishing that this kit came with a tourniquet, but for what I plan to use this first-aid kit for, I'm hoping I never run into a situation in which a tourniquet would be necessary! If I do, then something has gone very, VERY wrong. I also always wear a belt.TL;DR: This kit is cheap, and can be perfect for every-day use with the addition of Benadryl, ibuprofen, triple antibiotic, and switching out the bandages.",
