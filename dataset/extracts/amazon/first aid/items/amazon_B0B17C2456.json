Not sure why there is a question asking about pain relief. Antibiotics treat infections. They are not designed to relieve pain, although once the infection is gone, the pain should have resolved as well. I do think that I've seen better pricing. But when you need something, Amazon is convenient and quick with delivery, so you're willing to pay a little more sometimes.",
