And let me tell you, I'm thrilled with the quality and selection of items in this kit.Not only does this refill kit come with all of the essentials like bandages, gauze, and antiseptic wipes, but it also includes some more specialized items like a thermometer, a CPR mask, and a tourniquet. I love that this refill kit has everything I need to handle a variety of emergencies, from minor cuts and scrapes to more serious injuries.The items in this refill kit are also high-quality and durable. The bandages and gauze are made from soft and absorbent material, and the antiseptic wipes are effective at cleaning wounds. Plus, everything is neatly organized in a compact and portable case that makes it easy to take with me wherever I go.Overall, I would highly recommend this refill kit to anyone who wants to be prepared for emergencies. It's a great investment that will give you peace of mind knowing that you have everything you need to handle a variety of situations. Whether you're a parent, a hiker, or just someone who wants to be prepared for the unexpected, this refill kit is definitely worth considering.",

Most of those \"pieces\" are the cheap band-aids--sometimes with dubious sticking ability.YES, here, you do get 20 Q Tips; 10 cotton balls; 30 \"PE Adhesive plasters\" and 20 \"junior plasters\"--but, overall, there's some premium content with 80 excellent items that transcend mere \"boo boo\" treatments.SO, for those who \"roll their own\", this collection serves as an EXCELLENT BASE of core items or, in the alternative, a source to refill your existing FAKs--all wrapped up in a simple plastic bag. GREAT VALUE FOR ESSENTIALS. This is a great refill kit to buy for either purpose.",
