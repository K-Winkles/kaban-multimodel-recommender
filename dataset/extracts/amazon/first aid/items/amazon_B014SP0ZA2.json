                "reviewText": "I was so happy to find these on Amazon! I have not been able to find these in my local stores and was rationing my last box. They are by far the best water resistant bandages I have ever used. The material is cushioned, comfortable and stretches as you move. They\u2019re particularly good if you have a cut on your foot and would also be excellent for small blisters because of the cushioning. Adhesion is excellent if you apply to clean dry skin. Removal takes a little effort but it\u2019s not difficult or painful. The variety of sizes is also excellent. If you\u2019re looking for a good long lasting water resistant bandage and this is the right product for you! Highly recommended!",
