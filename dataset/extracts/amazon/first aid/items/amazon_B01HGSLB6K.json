                "reviewText": "We bought the Surviveware Waterproof First Aid Kit for on our boat. If you are reading this you are researching Waterproof first aid kits (we were in the same position as you doing our research). Probably like us, you've looked at several others maybe not even waterproof, and seeing the price tag compared to 90% of the others and wondering... We came back several times to this one, looking at others, looking at the company website and a range of other things. With one question in mind .. is it worth it .. YES !!Let's start with the quality of the case, RUGGED / DURABLE and WATERPROOF. Its small enough to store and carry around (it won't fit in your pocket like some other that are pictured bigger than they are). Reviews have mentioned the zipper... please its waterproof, its snugger to open than a normal zipper but with some wax or chap stick its relatively easy to open. The inside has clearly labeled compartments for all included first aid accessories. There is also an area for personal and other medications. All well laid out and easy to access.Then the contents; its very complete. We read reviews of it not containing items such as ointments, pills and other PERISHABLE items. These are picked up for a few dollars at your local pharmacy or supermarket and you know you have YOUR brand and they will still have a long shelf life. However the items included are not your typical as cheap as it can get items that we saw in other kits. High quality band-aids, gauze and other items are included that you know will work (we have all seen the band-aids that don't even stick) when you need them !Its an absolutely First Class First Aid Kit and would definitely recommend.",

I regularly pull from them and restock them as needed (bandaids, gauze, etc). Have added a few things as I find I need them (superfine tweezers, moleskin, personal meds, etc). Still need to add a couple items I may need in the future (knock on wood, but a CAT tourniquet, a squeeze bulb, etc).The compact size of this kit is great. The zippers are great - easy to open and access - it opens up and lays wide open nicely, is nicely labeled so you can keep it organized. It does have a little room to add a few things.The design is great - it comes well stocked initially and is a great starting point to have in your home, one in your car, one in (or attached to) your backpack. For how well stocked it is, it is very compact. It disappears in the bottom of a typical backpack really.",

                "reviewText": "With a huge amount of first kits available on Amazon I was keen to find one that suited my needs. I work offshore on yachts and I always like to have my own back up first aid kit in case the yacht's one is lacking in some way. In my free time I ski through the winter and spend the summers hiking and trail running. I like to keep the weight I carry to a minimum but I still feel more comfortable in the outdoors if I am ready for anything - within reason of course!After contacting the seller to chat through this kit I ordered it with the understanding that it was thoughtfully packed out with all the necessities while not being bloated and overweight. I was excited to unpack it when it arrived! Here are my thoughts:A lot of thought has gone into the kit to make sure that you have what you need but don't end up carrying around unnecessary items.Everything has its place so it is easy to find items. This is really important with the likely stress that is involved with a first aid situation. It is also easy to put items back in the right place and, after a trip away, it is easy to see what needs replacing.The bag that houses the kit is excellent quality and protects it's contents well. The zips work well, it has a handy carry handle and a great couple of loops on the back to strap it to a bag etc. In the attached picture I have strapped it to my camera bag.It is a good size. Big enough that I feel confident heading off for a few days camping but small enough to stuff into backpack pockets etc.A great item - I will be buying a second one so that I have one at home and one to travel with.",

The bag is sturdy, the contents are good quality, and the mini-zip-bags for personal meds are a nice bonus.I purchased this one for my Go-Bag. I would have purchased 3 more (for my vehicles and EDC), but it was out of stock for so long that I ended up putting together my own kits.There is a little room to add supplemental items. I added a few more wound closures, polysporin, a BIC lighter, a tick-remover, and moleskin.Yes, it's more expensive than some of the other small FAKs available, and if you're looking for something that will sit in your bathroom cabinet and only be brought out for paper cuts and scraped knees, maybe look at something less expensive. However, if you want something small for travel, hiking, sports, or emergencies, this is absolutely worth it!",

Includes some well thought out aspects: the ordered & clearly labled mesh compartments, a big plus. The 'Quick Ref. Guide'..etc...

It's mad me thinking well it shoulda, cudda include an Xxx? or a Yyy?!! As much for 'Health&Safty' and peace of mind I often carry (& use) it: forestry work, on the quad, in the car, on camping, boating & such activities, i've added many items and there's space for some of these extra bits in the bag. ie. some more 'burns' kit (as someone is often scalded or picking up hot embers), sharp needles & thread for splinters or stitching wounds, a propper tornique (just in case), Small Bot. of TCP solution (easy clean) & more wipes, Vasalene, Plasters (lots of), Wasp Spray, some antihist., Spray on skin, Ibuprofin, Paracetamol, AloeVera, Camomile ointment.. I'd like more room but where do we stop!? For these essential, but date-limited, extras I bought another smallish, semi-transparent (so easy and quick to see), totally 'waterproof' sailors' type roll-up bag!!.. haaha no, no not some transparent Supermarket shopping bags!?..nooo?

                "reviewText": "So, I felt compelled to write a review on this item as I spent some considerable time choosing a small first aid kit and had some doubts about it when ordering. However, I am not disappointed with my choice and want to address a couple of issues raised by others in their reviews.But first, a little about me. I am a former paramedic who switched professions some years back. I am now in a line of work that means I still see and deal with trauma and injuries and I now have a young family. So I have both professional standards and family expectations.I was looking to replace my old small FAK for home and camping as it had begun to perish and fall apart. I could have made a kit up with having access to supplies but still needed a new bag. I searched the web and amazon but kept coming back to this kit as I liked the layout of the bag. So eventually I bought it and it arrived within 24 hours for me.Some have commented on the value of the kit, that the contents aren\u2019t worth the cost. I can see where they are coming from as whilst there is a lot of items in the kit, they are made for Surviveware and so are not costing them anywhere near that. But, it is a good selection that to source yourself would require time, effort and you would end up with loads of spares. It all fits the bag nicely without squashing, a little room for extras and without leaving you wanting for anything too crucial. Remember, this is a small FAK. Not a grab bag or response kit. So I could swallow the premium on this occasion.The size. Some have concerns with the size but as you can see from the pictures, it\u2019s not too small yet small enough to be attached to either a belt, bag or webbing. Again, it\u2019s well stocked for the size.The front zip pocket allows for storage of personal meds and so on. A really nice feature that allows the user easy access to tablets, blister packets and so on.It comes sealed in a watertight bag (untested). Once opened though, it doesn\u2019t seem to re-seal that well, so I would assume this is more of a safety seal for sale and shipping. If you want it waterproof, buy a small dry bag to stick it in.The molle attachments seem strong and have additional Velcro tabs. Again, a nice bit of thought.Red is a good colour for a FAK. Along with green. Black, grey and other military style ones are only good for those that really need an operationally discreet FAK. If you want one for home or recreation, bare that in mind.The weight is not an issue. Its not heavy. Don\u2019t worry about it. The zips appear good quality. Large, easy sliding two way zips. The stitching and other integral parts of mine were spot on. No loose threads.The labelling system Is something new for me with a small FAK, but I like it and it means that anyone who picks it up is less likely to empty it all out or faf around looking for stuff.Not many of the items included have use by dates. They don\u2019t really need them. That said, the shortest date in my pack is 7/22 so about 2 years off.The removable cpr pouch is a nice item and again, robustly made.It\u2019s designed for the US. Whilst the first aid booklet still contains Valid instructions, it would have been nice to see it contain UK numbers like 999 but 112 will still work.Overall, I went for this out of laziness on my part and with some doubt, but I\u2019m glad I did. I think it is worth the money, but no more than the \u00a329.99 I paid. I would like to see it more around the \u00a320-25 mark and it would be a must for families or those who holiday a lot.I will be adding a few more items to my kit, a few more plasters (kids ones), a clinical waste bag, a few more gloves and some spray plaster, along side meds such as paracetamol, ibuprofen and antihistamines and the bag will take it.As time goes by, it gets used and so on, I\u2019ll update my review accordingly. So hopefully I don\u2019t end up eating my words.....",
