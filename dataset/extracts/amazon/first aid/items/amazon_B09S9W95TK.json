I bought this to go to Costa Rica and it was the best thing ever it had everything I could have even imagined. We even tried out the fishing line. Got a couple of nibbles but didn't catch anything but not surprised I can't catch anything with a pole. It has a compass that we used while hiking. Not big at all but a little heavy as it has a ton of stuff in it. But worth a little weight.",

The knife is sharpish, there are plenty of antiseptic wipes and alcohol pads, the multi tool has decent weight (the quality of it will be tested this weekend). The issues I have with this kit is that the fish hook and line doesn\u2019t look quality and the hooks came with nothing protecting them so if you\u2019re not careful, you might get pricked. The pocket chainsaw looks a little thin but let\u2019s see how well that works.**will update as I use what\u2019s in the kit**",
