                "reviewText": "This looked to be the best kit available for the money - a nice compromise between completeness and price. Has a huge assortment of odds and ends - hopefully way more than I will ever need. Part of the attractiveness of this kit was the sturdy, decently designed hard case it came in. I read about it in another review and it helped me decide on this one. Why spend money on a bunch of stuff that will be ruined by wet if I have to take additional steps to protect it? The case seems like it will do a good job of protecting all the contents.My only trouble with this kit was really not with the kit at all, but the supplier. When it came I discovered the expiration date was up in 6 months. My experience with other kits has been that they are generally good for at least a couple years. I immediately contacted the seller to ask if this was normal with this kit. They could not tell me whether it was or not and asked if they could send another kit to replace this one (good customer service there!). I said that would be fine and they told me I could keep the kit that would expire in a few months.When I received the newly mailed kit - you guessed it - exact same expiration date as the first. So I can only assume this lot of kits from this seller has been sitting in a warehouse for awhile. I can't imagine it would be normal for it to expire so quickly. If it is normal however, maybe that can explain why the kit is as modestly-priced as it is.To be honest, most things in the kit are not really subject to an expiration date, anyway. Aside from the drugs and unusual-type bandages most of it will be just fine well past the expiration date.Cheers!",

                "reviewText": "I've slowly been accumulating bandages, gauze and would care sprays but I always just use them up and then my tiny first aid kit is empty again. So I went looking for a bigger first aid kit to have on hand for those times I need to find something fast. It really doesn't do me any good to have gauze, medical tape and bandages if they are in a small pouch hidden under other stuff in the back of my hall closet and it never fails, that's where it is when I go to look for something.This kit has everything I will need for a very long time and it even has a quick reorder sheet in the event that I use stuff up and need to replace it. When I opened this first aid kit, I saw a whole bunch of bandages, tape ect. Then realized that there was more on the bottom!More bandages, an ice pack ect. This first aid kit is packed with everything a person would need. My husband has Aids so I always have rubber gloves and bandages on had in case he cuts himself and needs help bandaging his cut up. I also keep a mini kit in my purse at all times with gloves, gauze and medical tape in case we are out together and he needs a bandage. He also keeps bandaids in his wallet at all times, so we go through a lot of bandaids and bandages because he has really thin skin and he bleeds really easily, so something like this kit comes in real handy for us.Plus I have a 2 year old grandson who lives near me and I know from experience that kids get scrapes and cuts all the time so I know this first aid kit will come in handy with him around.",
