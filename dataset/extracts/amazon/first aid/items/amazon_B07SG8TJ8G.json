I would've liked having an internal pocket that would close so smaller items won't slip out but that's not a big deal.Price: The cost of mfr this bag has got to be pennies so despite it being less expensive than many of the others offered I feel it was still a little overpriced.Overall: Really good, will probably purchase again to ready for our daughters residence.",
