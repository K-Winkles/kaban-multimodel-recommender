I added a chem lite, a small O light flashlight, quick clot gauze, and a Victonox knife. Plenty of room if you get creative. The zippers needed a little lube but that is be expected. The bag itself is well made & functional. Inside, all the goodies are neatly packed and easily accessible. Price wise I feel like this was a good deal. If you were to purchase all the items individually I'm pretty sure you would find that it would exceed the cost of this kit, especially considering you get the shears & and the tourniquet.",
