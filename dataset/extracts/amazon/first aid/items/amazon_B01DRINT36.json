                "reviewText": "for 320 pieces its quite cheap. but i was mildy disappointed most of them were not fabric. most of them were plastic bandaids, which are known to cause allergic reaction, it seems to enhance the allergic reaction on top of the adhesive. especially if you have a allergy to bandaid adhesives/plastic. Also this seems to be pretty common allergy problem amongst other brands, and generic ones, some cause a nastier reaction than others. i used it mainly for atopic dermatitis rash, after i put on topical medication and covering it, it keeps the medication and rash from getting irritated partially.Also the adhesives quite a hit and miss. the fabric ones dont seem to have much adhesive and they tend to fall off quite easily, only some of plastic ones fall of quite eaisly. but i was pleasantly surprised how well they stayed on unlike the fabric ones. could it be the plastic and adhesives are better at sticking?Also the bandaids seems to be less effective if your skin sheds alot due to dermatitis, or its wet, or its an ointment.it doesnt stick as well. so be sure to use on dry surfaces, and skin should be as smooth as possible. damaged skin sticks less.Also to add more to the allergy to the adhesives and the plastic bandaids, it seems to be very common even amongst other brands, so im not saying tis only caused by this brand. but since the plastic ones seemed to cause a greater contact dermatitis than the fabric ones, i think its partially due to the pulling of the adhesives. On one occaison it may have resulted in a painful pimple induced by contact dermatitis.if you have atopic dermatitis or already inflammed or damaged skin that isnt caused by injury, the chances of the bandaids causing contact dermatitis is much higher since your prone to a skin reaction anyways. the longer the bandaids stay on the more likely it will cause a rash, so make sure to immediately remove the bandaid and switch it out often since it accumulates dirt and debris after a day or two.note only use it if your atopic dermatitis is currently WEEPing and you have already put on cream or ointment on it(Rx), and you must consult a physician before doing this",
