                "reviewText": "This product as a whole is fine, there are a ton of supplies and a large variety. The bag itself, however, is far too small and lacks the amount of separation for this bag to have any real efficient use in an actual emergency. All of the supplies come in a plastic bag inside of the bag shown in the photos that must be either ripped open or cut with scissors. The bag has elastic connecting the two sides of the inside of the bag, resulting in it closing if you do not have both hands on it at all times, which is fine if you need a bandaid but if I ever have to act quickly, this bag wastes time. The straps and pockets on the inside are the dumbest design choice, especially considering that the consumer is responsible for organizing the supplies into this bag. There is no good way for the supplies to be stored without them just ending up loose in the bag. There are scissors and tweezers that just physically cannot be stored in any practical way within the bag. Overall I am not super impressed with it.",
