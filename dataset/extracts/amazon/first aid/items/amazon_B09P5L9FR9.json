                "reviewText": "Using this in my personal vehicle (I\u2019m an EMT). I absolutely love the design and quality of the bag. The zippers zip and unzip with ease. This has a great variety of equipment to carry in your personal vehicle. Bag is the perfect size, just what I was looking for. Bag is not too bulky andnot too small either. I love the dividers and although I haven\u2019t had a need to really move them a whole lot, I think it would be easy to adjust them. Started with this set and added a few things to it. Side pockets can hold quite a bit of stuff. Love the star of life logo on the top also. The black bag with the yellow reflective tape and the light blue/white star of life looks great. Overall, a great bag and great equipment. Great for first responders wanting to carry equipment in their personal vehicle. Love it.",
