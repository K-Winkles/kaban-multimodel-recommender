It doesn\u2019t have labels like other medical kits I\u2019ve bought, which means it might take longer to find something, but that\u2019s expected with its compact size. I made sure to have the important stuff in the front and easily accessible",

                "reviewText": "First off, I received this bag in timely fashion. As you can see above, the back is roughly 8.5\u201d in height, a little over 5.5\u201d in width, and approximately 5.5\u201d in depth. It is a great pack to carry on long trip and is extremely light. The bag has multiple compartments and if you take items out, you need to be able to recall how to repack them, as it can take a minute to repack if not. I\u2019m not much of an outdoors man, but the pack is equipped with a knife, fire starter, first aid, tourniquets, and most of the required equipment to treat moderate injuries temporarily until help arrives. I am glad to have a pack like this for the times me and my family go on hikes and have some since of security I can provide them with the immediate care they need if some injury occurs.--",
