                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Mini First Aid Kit",
                "reviewText": "Because it contains 120 individual items, it provides comprehensive coverage of all the fundamentals required for treating small wounds and accidents. This makes it useful for use in a variety of contexts, including but not limited to the home, the workplace, travel, and other types of outdoor activities. This pack contains everything I need to treat a minor injury, such as a headache, a blister, or a little cut. This first aid kit stands out from others because it has a sturdy casing, which distinguishes it from other options that are more flimsy. Because of its sturdy and waterproof design, it is suitable for use during outdoor activities as well as when traveling since it protects the medical supplies within. It is the ideal size for the glove box of my vehicle, my bag, or even my purse, allowing me to have it close at hand at all times in case I ever need it. The organization that is included in the kit is flawless. The many compartments and separators preserve the goods in their proper places, preventing them from being mixed up or damaged while they are being transported. In addition to this, it has labeled pockets, which make it simple to find the appropriate item even when time is of the essence. This set has come in handy for me on many different occasions, and each time it has shown why it is so valuable. My ankle sprained somewhat when I was out hiking and using the quick cold pack brought me rapid relief from the pain. In a different incident, a friend of mine had a minor burn while cooking, and the burn ointment and bandage came to her rescue.",

I also take This with me to my son\u2019s little league games as well, because we have seen a lot of injuries over the years. Mostly during practice when there isn\u2019t a concession area to ask for help.Also, I appreciate the color and the style of case, because it is easy to see in a dark backpack. The firmness of the case is a nice touch as well, because I do not feel like it will be crushed. I have taken it out on a few trips and it looks good as new.\u201cI\u2019d rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it\u201d - some wise old man",

The bandage stuck better to my hand, while the edges of the bandage started peeling away from my knuckle after a couple of hours.note: there is only one 2\"x4\" bandage, but lots of 3/4\" x 2-1/5\" bandages.The gloves are thin; but, they fit my small sized hands well.The product description page says that this is a \"...waterproof hard shell...\".When I closed this case, even with the two zippers right near each other, there is still a tiny gap where water could enter (see pic where I wrote \"gap\").Overall, I find this First Aid Kit to be somewhat adequate, with too many adhesive plasters (bandages), only 1 gauze roll, 1 eye wash, 1 burn cream and just a few gauze pads.",
