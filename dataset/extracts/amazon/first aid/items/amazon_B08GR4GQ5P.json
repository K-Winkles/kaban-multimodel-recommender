But they would be effective and useable in a pinch, they absolutely would as are the first aid items. For that reason and the fact that the pack they come in is well made and very useful, I believe this item is a good value. 5 stars",

You couldn't find everything it had in it individually for cheaper. My son loved it, my husband was jealous of it. My husband ordered one similar to it but smaller years ago. I think he'd like an upgrade (maybe an anniversary gift) I looked at several different ones for hours comparing reviews, prices & what came in it. I really wanted him to have one with a compass & shovel & such. This had it all. This is a great gift for anyone & well worth the price!",

                "reviewText": "For the price it's actually a good kit except for the fact that you're paying for someone else to put it together for you. You can build your own kit with higher quality items. However, I really got it for the bag and for the foldable silverware set. The silverware set I received is a generic knockoff of the Winchester from a couple decades ago. It is not the one pictured in the photo which is why I wanted it. \u2639\ufe0f The shovel and the other items in it of course are going to be cheap and can't be subjected to extreme conditions. But if this was the only kit you had in a survival situation it would definitely serve its purpose and help keep you alive. It also can show you how to build your own kit you can use it as a template. The compass that came with it is pretty cheap but it works not great but it works. The tactical pen well I think that's rather gimmicky but whatever. The flashlight is pretty cheap but it works. The knife handle is all plastic but it is spring assisted so easily opened by one hand. It will work in a pinch. What can I say, it's a cheap kit and you're going to get cheap stuff in the kit. Even though I was disappointed with the cheap knockoff foldable spoon and fork, combo I still will use it because it was cool 20 years ago when I got my first one and it's still cool now but it's not as nice as the others I have. I was hoping for that unique knife on there. Anyway the bag is nice. I got the camo and the velcro is decent quality. I want to buy another one to put in my wife's car for her. It's just more convenient to have somebody else build the kit for most people I think. Personally I built my own that's way better but this is a good piece of kit to have in a pinch and gives you a template to build your own. I really wanted it for the bag and the unique foldable silverware. But it's nice to have the other items too.",
