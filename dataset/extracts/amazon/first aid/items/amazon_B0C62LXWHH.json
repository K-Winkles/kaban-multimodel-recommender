                "reviewText": "If you\u2019ve ever lived on the Jersey shore, you\u2019ll know of green-heads. They are large, angry flies that bite hard and cause you to swell up and itch like crazy. I used to spend every summer on the Jersey shore and would come out of it with so many annoying green-head bites.I still go back in July and August to visit my family, which is usually the worst time for green-heads, so bringing these with me is a must. They are definitely great to have on hand. Since each one is individually wrapped, it makes it really convenient to bring a handful in your purse or beach bag to take care of any bites as soon as they happen. Overall, they work pretty well, and any relief from those green-head bites is definitely a plus for me.",
