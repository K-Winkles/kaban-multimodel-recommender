                "reviewText": "Band-Aid Brand is better than other brands in several ways. One of the most important is the way the Band-Aid brand stays on your skin for a lot longer than other brands I have tried. Another great point is the protective material that you put over your sore is very soft, and I believe is thicker than other brands. Also, when it is time to remove the Band-Aid, it comes off without ripping your skin! Go for the little more expensive brand and you will get a much better band-aid.",

I like that they are clear so you can see them very well. Now, if they just came in a larger than 50 pack.",

                "reviewText": "I used Sheer Strip Band-aids for decades and now they aren't available and I really don't like these very much at all. The Sheer Strip pad went from edge to edge of the adhesive part and I liked that much better as the edges just sit there and dangle out and don't stick and then water gets in anyway so it isn't water resistant in the least. I am a pharmacist and the harsh soaps that are used in hospitals cause my cuticles near the end of my nails to split and they bleed and are very painful. I have always put antibiotic ointment and a a band-aid to cover them and to get them to heal. The newer versions are not nearly as good and I have been doing this for 40 years. So this is not a new thing with me. Thank you Corporate America for fixing things that aren't broken. Oh and the newest ones don't have a flange of folded over paper so that when you pull off the second part of the paper just before placing it, it is unavoidable to contaminate the pad with one's finger and the whole point of having that part be sterile is so that your wound doesn't get bacteria in there. Even better!!!",
