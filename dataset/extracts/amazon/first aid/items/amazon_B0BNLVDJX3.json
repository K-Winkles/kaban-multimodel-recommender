Having my fingers bandaged for days on end gets annoying fast, mostly because of things like bulky strips limiting how much I can bend my fingers and crappy adhesive making the bandages not last as long.These bandages are some of the best I\u2019ve used. They\u2019re flexible, not too bulky, stay on well. They\u2019re my favorites along with bamboo, though bamboo tends to be a bit more expensive. And the patterns make these more pleasant to look at haha.My only complaint is that the individual bandage packaging can be a little more difficult to open than others, but it\u2019s still worth it.",
