This kit gets you 95% of the way there it has all of the dressings and first aid tools you would expect. It has some nice but really use features like the multitool and the emergency poncho. Not sure how often those would be used but it\u2019s nice to have them. They are all packed very tightly into a small 4 x 6 pouch. If I have one complaint, it\u2019s finding what you\u2019re looking for in this pouch. You kind of have to dump it all out to find what you\u2019re looking for. Additionally, it does not include any blood coagulator powder, which is really important for wounds, especially in a car accident. I would also have the moisturizing burn dressings that could be applied to hands or face that have been burned. Otherwise, I can recommend this.",
