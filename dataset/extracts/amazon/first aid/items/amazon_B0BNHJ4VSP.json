                "reviewText": "Not all first aid bags are the same and this one in particular is oriented towards trauma. The bag itself is fairly rugged quality with several straps that allow it to be hooked onto a backpack or other equipment and while it can be attached quite snug and stable, it has a quick release strap. The flag and little cross are velcro and can be removed easily and you can buy other velcro items to stick onto it for decoration instead. There is a lot of space for organization and everything inside is fairly quickly accessible without the need to take much of anything else out. Although the items feel somewhat cheap in comparison to supplies at my workplace, they perform their function well regardless. It would be unrealistic to have such an assortment of hospital grade supplies and a bag at this price range. There is also a little flashlight but no battery, so to make this a complete kit after purchasing I would recommend throwing some batteries in the bag, maybe put some more plain 2x2 gauze and some antibiotic ointment. Otherwise, this is a quick and easy way to get a nice bag with an assortment of supplies especially if you don't want to go through the effort of making your own bag or unsure what you need to put in one.",

Very little shift inside even when it gets tossed around.Flashlight requires 3 AAA batteries (not included).Includes most things one would want for outdoor first aid (including a tourniquet kit), even a small splint hidden under the triangle bandage and emergency blanket. (The splint is really small and not the sturdiest: it\u2019s probably the one thing I would recommend most supplement, since they are needed so often and a larger size is going to be needed - that\u2019s probably due to the overall compact nature of this kit.)Space for personalization inside and out (including adding extra sets of various size medical grade gloves - I never understand why kits almost always include one pair of crappy badly sized gIoves!). I like how there are a variety of ways to attach it securely molle-style.",
