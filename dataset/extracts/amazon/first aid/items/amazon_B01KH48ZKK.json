There are a few items that are definitely advanced level, and will require proper training and licensure to use effectively and legally. The only thing I wish they would change is the blood pressure cuff and stethoscope as well as adding some smaller rolled gauze. Overall a very comprehensive kit that I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy again.Oh and don\u2019t forget to add a couple CAT tourniquets and a chest seal!",
