                "reviewText": "I bought this because I liked the case, and it appeared to have a nice starter set. I do have one big criticism, however. It's missing some rather important items that I think first aid kits should have. It's missing: antibiotic cream, burn treatment, sting treatment, cold packs, and pain relievers. Some of these are understandable omissions. But leaving out antibiotics in a kit that is clearly aimed at treating wounds is a big deal. I'm not docking the rating, because they do say exactly what's in the kit. Just read more carefully than I did, and be ready to add stuff to it.If you're willing to add a few necessary bits to customize the kit to your needs, it's a decent place to start.",
