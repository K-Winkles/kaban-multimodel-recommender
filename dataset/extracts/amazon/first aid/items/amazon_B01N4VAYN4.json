                "reviewText": "200 hundred dollar of awesomeness. The bag is tuff and durable. This is my 7th purchase from this company and I haven't had any complaints. I bought this bag because it had the top flip clip thats can be used in my car. In my last picture I'm pointing it out. If you take that over your headrest and put the clip through the middle of the two bars, then tighten it will hold it perfectly against your seat.Perfect for traveling. I'd recommend also getting the bags as well. My set up is the main zip that lays flat has all my trauma gear. The second zip has my BP cuff, stethoscope, splints, wraps. The smaller zip were the velcro is perfect for storing gloves. The smaller molle zip has my pen lights, extra shears(2), and extra pads and rolls so I don't have to open the main compartment., also have my 2 of the folling pens, permanent markers, and note pads. The bags I call my fast bags, the blue one has all my burn gels, ice packs, and burn bandages. The yellow one is my ouch pouch basic first aid kit with Aspirin for hose headaches and MIs, also have band aids, wound cleaners, and glucose. The red bag has my cat tourniquets(3) ,Israeli bandages(2), bleed stop spray(1) and guazes(4), krinkle guaze(1), and chest seals (3). My green bag is all my airway, it has OPAs (6), NPAs(6), and has 02 tubing. I DO NOT carry O2 with me but when in traveling I know that the EMS does carry so I also have a Non rebreather mask Regular O2 mask and nasal cannula.****** Sone of the items I listed came from my other pack I have I do believe that was refill kit R. But from all my other purchases I have had all the following refill kitsKit R,J,X,P,L,B, and this kit from this purchase. I only have my three bags one for the car, my household one. And now a tactical bag that's smaller and less a pain to carry. I hope this review helped someone make this purchase or inspired you to follow this company and find a fit for you. I would like to say that I am not affiliated with this company in any way only as a satisfied customer and the main reason I keep purchasing from them.",

                "reviewText": "I did a lot of research, and even spent an hour going though this product with my sister who is a medical nurse.Not only does this check all the boxes and come with a great bag, but the quality of the medical materials is very good! I was originally hesitant, but after sorting the packages, and even breaking the seal on a few duplicate items to assess quality I've been very impressed. Many items are name brand, the rest are their \"Lightning products\" brand which seems to be very comparable. NONE of the items seem to be low quality or something I would not want to use in an emergency.Bag is water resistant and is made of a plastic lined material, comfortable padding/adjustment when worn, Molle and sealing \"military\" zippers is a huge plus as well. (pic)Although I feel most any 'normal' circumstance is fully covered and then some, I went the extra step and wanted to include treatment for more grizzly wounds such as working with chainsaws, machinery, and firearms. I added:- MOST IMPORTANTLY a headlamp. 50% of earth's rotation is night, every medkit needs a hand-free light!- Permanent Marker- *Additional individual sterile gloves- *Second Fishing Forceps- Medline 35 Wide Skin Stapler- SAM Bleeding Control Kit (Better for heavy bleeds and better *tourniquet)- *SAM Chitosan Hemostatic Dressing (Better bandage for large wound clotting)- *SAM Chest Seals (lung puncture \"sticker\" to seal/stabilize against collapsing)- *Additional Israeli bandages for wrapping- Petroleum bandages for continued care on healing wounds- *Antiseptic Silvasorb Silver Hydrogel for continued care- *Additional Israeli bandages- Saline Wash* Items in kit but purchased separately for additional quantity or better qualityAlso to note. Everything will fit in the bag EXCEPT the Pulmonary Resuscitator, CPR Mask, Stethoscope, and Blood pressure cuff will NOT! You'll want a separate (similar sized) bag for those items as even when unpackaged they are too bulky and either don't fit at all, or would require displacing large amounts of the other items.",
