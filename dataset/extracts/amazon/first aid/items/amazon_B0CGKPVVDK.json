It feels cold on my arm after applying it and it definitely gives relief for the itchy and stinging feeling I constantly have.It's a bit awkward that this is in individual tiny packages. This reminds me a bit of having the squeeze ketchup out of those packages at a fast food place.On the other hand, the tiny package idea is really good for first aid kits.I'd say this is a very good product to have and I put some in my purse just to have around in case I need them.",

Not real super keen to burn myself to try it out for that. These little packets contain lidocaine and Benzalkonium Chloride for numbing and antiseptic purposes, and are easy enough to pack in a purse, car, camping box, or first aid kit. Nice to have around. Right now it's a nice visual gag that we slide across the table when someone lands a real zinger.",
