                "reviewText": "This bag is the perfect size to keep a decent amount of supplies in. I like the small pockets, and envelopes inside to keep things organized. The outside zipper seems very solid and i have had no issues with the zipper splitting or breaking. I keep this in the glove box of my car. I also like that its bright colour is easy to find, and even if I couldn't get to it, I could easily direct someone where to look and they would be able to find it.",
