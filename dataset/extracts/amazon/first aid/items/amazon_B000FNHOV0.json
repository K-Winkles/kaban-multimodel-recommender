We did shop around and found that the Nexcare waterproof tape sold by Amazone was attratively priced.It arrived promptly as ordered .... But, more importantly, it met our needs..... a string tape, waterproof indeed (sticking on the skin even after 7 daily showers). I am using it to assure that a diabetic sensor stays in place on my arm.And after a week use, it is not hard to remove from the skin.The bottom line: I recommend this product first of all because of its excellent characteristics. A great product to out bandages, splints, sensors and so much more in place as needed..... And yes.. we liked the price from Amazon too.It is nice when you find a competitively priced product that is a good value as well as being of good quality! Isn't that the way it is supposed to be ... ALWAYS. YES of course it SHOULD always be that way... but it isn't !! This time it was excellent and we can recommend this item!",
