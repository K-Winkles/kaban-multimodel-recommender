Instant ice pack, emergency blanket, tweezers. etc I like the little extra space for my own personal stuff like aspirin or my liquid bandage. Few extra pockets on door too..But for most part, it's packed! The bonus is the restock number right on side of box with qr code also so restocking should be easy..Hangs nicely, I installed cup holders on side for my hydrogen peroxide and alcohol bottle since that's the real first aid.
