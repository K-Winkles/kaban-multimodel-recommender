It has everything a person who has basic first aid training needs and nothing they don't need. Plenty of extra space once you've stocked it. I'll add some extra ABD pads and probably a roller splint. The bag seems durable. Definitely heavier than the kits I've seen in stores. Should take a good beating rolling around in the trunk and truck box.",
