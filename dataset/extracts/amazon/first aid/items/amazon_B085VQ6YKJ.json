BUT that is soo much better than most other brands that just come completely undone, and its not . Good price, great quality.",

The tape I got from my first aid kit did not stay on so I ordered this.The tape is durable and sticky without being messy or tacky. It was easy to tear off when applying. The downside is when I put on pants sometimes the tape does roll back while some of the other strips stays on fine.I have slept with it on and notice that it does roll into itself or sticks to the bedding. Even though this occurs, the entire bandage is still on my leg!!!While not perfect, it does the job I need it to do which is to keep the gauze pad over my skin.",
