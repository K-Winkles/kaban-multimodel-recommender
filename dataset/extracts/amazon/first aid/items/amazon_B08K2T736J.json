I\u2019m 99% sure this is the exact brand the urgent care used to wrap me up because the colors & quality are dead on. Incredibly inexpensive considering one singly ugly beige roll will cost you $7+ at the drugstore. Great for holding a splint on while keeping things comfy. Also works well if your nail lifts or breaks and you need something more secure than a bandaid to hold it until you can fix it",
