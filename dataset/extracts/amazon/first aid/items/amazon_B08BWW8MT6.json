                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Really is fully stocked!",
                "reviewText": "I'd been researching quite a bit, trying to find a good first aid kit for my family's emergency backpack (to be kept in the car - we're in earthquake territory). It seems like other first aid kits just didn't offer enough. That's when I realized I needed to include the word \"trauma\" in my searches. This lead me to many more appropriate kits that were larger and had a larger variety of necessary items. However they were a lot more money. This one seemed too good to be true when I saw it here on Amazon so I actually called the company in Brooklyn, N.Y. Hopefully I didn't make the guy rethink what they're selling cause I kept saying what a good deal it seemed to be. ;) The bag is about the size I'd imagined - not as small as most first aid bags but not one of these big tote ones you imagine the pros having either. It's a good medium size, maybe a bit larger than I expected but not too large for putting in an emergency backpack. Also, if you don't add a lot more items to it, it's flexible so you can shove it in there or even empty contents (use just the bags inside it) if you're really concerned about space. It's a good bright color (blue) and sturdy and roomy, and has two roomy pockets on either side that are empty. I put toiletries on side and water-purification items on the other. The items came in two sealed bags and everything inside seems to be of good quality, e.g. scissors don't seem flimsy at all and everything else seems to be of good quality as well. We'll add excedrin and sunscreen and other things we might need (and if I saw iodine in there - can't remember now - be careful cause iodine allergies can be deadly though most people aren't allergic).My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a little booklet of instructions including CPR, but I assume that's cause it's more of a professional's bag. Frankly, I wouldn't have the first clue about how to use the CPR mask and all its little contraptions, nor a lot of the other stuff. I'm also planning on calling them back to see if they have their own booklet of instructions I can get from them just cause it'll fit the products better. If not, I'll just go buy one. So with that in mind, it's not quite as inexpensive - if I have to go buy a book still!Last thing I want to say is that there's a lot of stuff in those bags so I suggest looking them over in advance with some sort of instruction book (however you get it) unless you're already a pro - because if you have an emergency on your hands and have to rummage through the stuff, it might be a bit overwhelming. What's nice is that each of the two plastic transparent bags have lists facing the outside which say what's inside of each bag. So that will definitely help.Edit: I finally got all the stuff out the other night and organized and labelled each item, separating them into smaller ziplock style bags. Since these will be in an emergency backpack which needs to be lightweight, the big bag it came with is just taking up room and adding unnecessary weight albeit not much. What I did while doing this is I looked up youtube videos about how to use each of these items, based on the items' names that were on the lists the bag came with. So now I have a fairly strong understanding of how to use these things. I also added a few items to such as a Quikclot, a thermometer, a CPR mask to go with the shield, a pen light that has replaceable batteries, israeli battle dressing (compression bandage to wrap around a pad on a wound), a pair of latex-free gloves (which brings it to two pairs which should be enough for true emergencies), aspirin in case of a heart attack, tweezers, and a small mirror. Many of these ideas are thanks to other people's suggestions in these reviews.",

                "reviewText": "This bag is much smaller than it appeared in the picture and than I expected. It is no larger than a shoe box. That being said, it does come rather well equipped (especially for only $40!) It contains:- plenty of gauze in the form of 4x4,s, eye patches, abdominal pads- insect bite wipes- disinfectant wipes- burn sheets and self cooling burn gauze- loads of adhesive bandages- tape- wire splint- roll gauze 3 sizes- oropharyngeal airways- bite stick- hemostats- oral resuscitation barrier- ammonia inhalants **- gloves **- seatbelt cutter **- tourniquetI removed the items with stars above. Ammonia inhalants are not in my department's operating procedures.The gloves look like they're out of the paint section at home depot. Desperately thin and too small. I added my own gloves. The seatbelt cutter is good but I have one on my rescue knife which I added so no need for 2. The tourniquet does not impress. Not military spec. Instead it is a stretching plastic band with a bit of Velcro at the ends. No ability to crank it down and effectively stop bleeding. Also not sure how it will work on large extremities such as thigh or very small areas such as forearm. Kept it in because it's small and in case of severe trauma but will use the israeli dressing I added first.I also added pocket mask/infant pocket mask, israeli battle dressing, stethoscope, lots of gloves, rescue knife, and trauma shears. It all somehow fit in the bag (which has a handy movable divider in the main compartment). When I have to use this I'm sure i'll make a mess of it getting to anything that's not on top, but it's all there in a nice, handy, seemingly durable, bag that fits easy in the trunk of my car.",

                "reviewText": "This kit is way more than just band-aids, especially if you upgrade its contents. I keep it in the trunk of my car, and it feels good to know that I have it on hand. I added a mini Maglite, a Leatherman tool, the Red Cross Heartsaver First Aid Quick Reference Guide, Aspirin, Benadryl, and tick tweezers. I also upgraded many of the items as recommended by Geneva Four.The bag is thin, with no reinforcement at all. It is a good compact size, with enough room to add extra items. To give the bag some rigidity, I cut a piece of its box to make a U shaped channel which reinforces the sides and base. That works really well.I use two or three Ziploc bags to categorize the internal contents. I keep the CPR mask in one pocket, gloves and the tourniquet in the other.",

                "reviewText": "This kit has a great variety of first aid and trauma gear. As an upcoming EMT student, it is an excellent bag to keep in the trunk of my car. Originally, the order said that the bag was blue, but I received a neon orange color with reflective strips on the side and I personally like it much better than blue. It will be easier to locate in a rush, so it's very nice.This kit comes with your standard gear like bandages, gauze pads, reflective blanket, BP cuff, tourniquet, and much more. It even comes with a tube of glucose, which I'm not sure why it would be included in the kit, but it works for me because I have a good friend who has Type-1 diabetes, so I keep it in the kit for him.The bag is very spacious and definitely has room for more equipment, so I'll be sticking a BVM in there.Overall, an excellent bag for its price.",
