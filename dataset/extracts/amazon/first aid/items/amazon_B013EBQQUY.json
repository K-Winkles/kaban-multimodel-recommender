                "reviewText": "I bought this as a first aid kit for a small adventure motorcycle.The value is excellent. The build quality is pretty good. I wish there was a little more room for additional items because many people will want to add some of their own specialty items. I was able to add an assortment of OTC medications in single dose packs and a few topical packets of burn ointment, hydrocortisone anti-itch ointment, and triple antibacterial ointment.Safety pins are handy but 15 seems a bit excessive in a small kit.The tourniquet is light duty but probably adequate.The medical scissors also seemed light duty but adequate. Most small first aid kits in this price range omit this very useful item.The CPR mask is an item I probably won't use as the last I checked, the recommendation was chest compression only. I removed the sterile eye wash, useful as it is, as something I was concerned might spill in rough handling or freeze and rupture.The small tweezers are a great item that's often overlooked. Many small first aid kits have little or no gauze and no tape but this kit has a small but useful quantity of each, as well as moleskin, fingertip bandages and knuckle bandages. Many inexpensive kits get a high item count at a low cost by including way too many of the same low quality adhesive bandages in maybe two sizes. This kit has useful amounts of bandages in a wide variety, including specialty bandages that might commonly be needed.Pro Tip: A first aid kit is always carried and for most people, seldom used. I slipped my first aid kit into a 4 mil thick clear plastic bag and heat sealed it to waterproof it. It's easy to rip open the bag if needed and I can reseal it when I return from my trip. This is a very inexpensive and lightweight method to waterproof a first aid kit. 6 mil plastic would be even better.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Well-stocked and packed tight, but the slightest bit lacking",
                "reviewText": "Basically exactly what I was hoping for, but a couple items in particular, like the scissors and safety blanket, were a bit redundant for my kit. I can't imagine anyone who both cares enough about safety to have a first aid kit and, at the same time, doesn't already have a multitool or other pocket knife ready to go. The included guide is definitely a plus, considering the very real possibility that I'm the one incapacitated around my decidedly less-prepared friends and loved ones (no offense to them, some people don't have the time or energy for this nonsense, and more power to them I say, so long as the rest of us loons stay vigilant.)In addition, everything being individually bagged within the larger bags is exactly the kind of paranoid packing I love. If one thing gets ruined, you can be pretty sure everything else will be just fine, even if, for example, the included saline solution gets punctured somehow.I'm planning to swap out the previously mentioned redundancies in this kit for a simple antibiotic topical cream, which I think will be a bit more sensible for my own kit, but YMMV. I suppose they may have not included this both to save on crucial storage pace, since the pouch is packed to the gills with useful goodies, and to avoid the stuff going bad on an end user who didn't use it for a while and forgot to maintain it. All in all, I'd recommend this either as a standalone kit for briefer trips or as a supplemental/backup kit for the home, office, or motor vehicle.",
