But not this bag\u2026this bag #1 allows me to be organized-I have Lupus and I\u2019m on 24 medications, so being on top of what I\u2019m taking is key. #2 the detailed compartments allow me to get in and out of an area quickly so that when my little dude is on my lap, I can get away with taking a necessary RX. #3 when it\u2019s closed and zipped and even open and zipped, it is impossible for our dog to get into.

The openness of the design meant I could fill it with whatever I needed without having to figure out how to jerryrig it all together so it would fit. My only beef with this item is that once it's completely full of stuff, it's hard to zipper shut, and I'm really straining those zippers with all I packed in. If the vinyl interior sections are packed to their full capacity, you'll have a hard time closing it. That was kind of frustrating. Other than that, it seems to be a decent bag and I love that it's a double-zipper on the outside so you can quickly access your things. Great first aid bag!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a good bag to hold and organize first aid supplies for our pups. This bag is perfect! It's just the right size to hold everything (except one wide bottle of activated charcoal powder). I have an assortment of single use gels, ointments, that sort of thing in one flap, a muzzle in the other flap, a soft cone in the largest pocket, and the other two large pockets hold bandages, Benadryl, styptic powder, and antiseptic spray. It's easy to stick in the car when we go on hikes or trips.",
