                "reviewText": "I was excited about the AllSett Health Instant Ice Cold Packs. I\u2019ve used similar items in doctor\u2019s offices before, so I knew how quick and effective these kinds of things are.Our family enjoys camping and hiking. I try to keep a good first aid kit handy for the unexpected injuries (as well as the nosebleeds I sometimes experience). These are absolutely perfect for camping and first aid. In the past we\u2019ve done an improvisation with zip-lock bags, ice and dish towels. This is SO much better! The packs are a nice size to use on various body parts. They\u2019re extremely easy to activate, just fold and pop the inner bubble, shake and apply. You get a pretty decent amount of cold time with a pack too. It actually lasts longer than the advised time for an ice application. I still find it helpful to wrap them in something though as they get very cold.In addition to camping supplies I\u2019m distributing these to other areas where I can quickly access them. (You get 25 per order.) I\u2019ve placed some in the kitchen cabinet, some in the bathrooms and even a few in our hurricane preparedness supplies. I\u2019d put some in the car too, but I don\u2019t know if heat could damage them. Perhaps someone else might know the answer to that.****About me: Integrity is very important to me. Reviews I've posted will be from items I've had direct contact with. These are my honest opinions. I will not post a review for a product I have not had personal contact with.",

I folded it in half and squeezed and put it in a table and pushed on it, just couldn\u2019t pop it. Anyway, it does work great and stays cold for at least 20 minutes.",

No amount of force I could apply would pop the interior water bag to get the cold going. I actually bruised my hand trying. Could have used an ice pack! LOL.",

                "reviewText": "Great to have in first aid kits on the go when ice isn't accessible. Folding it and breaking the inner liquid pouch was a little scary for me at first because I didn't know how much pressure to use - a lot is needed and it makes me pretty confident these aren't going to get activated on their own in my kits. I did a test run with one, it gets cold fast and was at 31F within 2 minutes, at the 20 minute mark it was at 42F. This was just on my counter with a thermometer, obviously with body heat it will warm more quickly, but I'd say I should easily be able to get 15 minutes of cold to take the edge off. I didn't see an expiration date anywhere on these, so I'm hoping if they don't get used in a timely manner that the ingredients will be stable for at least a couple years. Would recommend these to anyone with kids on the move.",
