Me too, which is exactly what makes this worth every penny.These bandages stick so well they make an octopus getting its oil changed seem slicker than a Greenland bridge on Christmas day.Not only do they stick well, but they also stop the bleeding faster than a dry fart through spandex.They could use these bandages to patch the leaking holes of the largest dam in the world and not only would it stop the leaking, but it would absorb the water so well that wet side of the dam would dry up like the Sahara desert overnight.Am I a spokesperson for this company? Absolutely not.Would I if they paid me?Absolutely.Would I recommend this product either way? Not only would I recommend it, I would say your IQ is that of sparrow that continues flying into a closed window because it thinks it's open if you think twice about buying these bad boys.Go ahead and getcha some... you'll be glad you did.",
