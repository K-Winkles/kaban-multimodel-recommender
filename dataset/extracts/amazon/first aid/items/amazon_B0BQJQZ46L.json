                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. TLDR of video for people who want a short and sweet answer:You get a lot of stuff for the price, and it's definitely high quality stuff. It just isn't a lot of it, and it most likely come bent or damaged, and you just have to deal with it since it's the way it's mass produced. It does indeed contain sterile 12-ply woven gauze, so for that value, and that you get everything else for $3 or even more stuff for $10 plus a instant cold pack, it's definitely a good value. We aren't going to use anything here for big wounds that are severe. It's good general all purpose aid, and generally, the items are of not the highest quality compared to separate items. It is however very high quality for the amount you get and genuinely the highest value out of all other items.The ice pack is not very good also, you can see right off the bat, so don't get these if that's a priority. Also don't get these if tape or gauze wrap is a priority, just get these if you need a nice variety and supply of good quality bandaids and antiseptics for general use. The tape and gauze wrap are nice and not what you are paying for.Have a happy holiday.(Written by Zach, not Mary, another in the household)",
