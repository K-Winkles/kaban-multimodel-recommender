                "reviewText": "I've purchased several of these kits, all from different distributors to see what the quality is like. This is the most comprehensive, well made set out of the lot. The last one I gifted, (this one I'm keeping for myself), it was a very good set, except the container, once everything was taken out, you could not put it back the way it was! Unless you took a video of yourself taking everything out, it would never close right, again. This set? I took everything out, each piece was sturdy, including the hammer and the shovel, and put everything back neatly. It did not have to go back in, in any particular way. There's enough room and pockets throughout to fit everything in and not struggle to close it. The knives in this set, and there are several are very good quality. I'm actually going to carry the pocket knife, since I'm constantly opening things, as there are still other knives in the kit. As far as hardware goes? You can't do any better than this for the price. What would I improve? I'm going to add more bandages, antiseptic spray, mace, and a few other items. There's room in here and still light enough for a child to carry. The buckles on it are solid, too. That's another issue that I've had recently, plasticy, weak buckles that break. I have a pup, too, so I need things that aren't going to fall apart when chewed on. The patches are velcro'd on, so they can be swapped out. Overall, a good set.",

                "reviewText": "The kit arrived in a much smaller case than I thought could possibly hold all of the advertised items, but it was all in there. The case is a nice, durable nylon material and would be useful by itself. The shovel and multi-tool (pliers, hammer, axe, screwdriver, knife, saw, etc.) are small, but they have to be to fit in the case. I was impressed with how useful they could be given their size - you're not going to split a cord of wood with the axe or dig a foxhole with the shovel, but for small tasks they'd probably work. The knife is sharp, and the water bottle carrier seems like a good idea. The eating utensil is clever, though I couldn't figure out all 8 advertised uses, and you need to retain the knife cover if you want to safely use the spork end! There are two compasses of the floating ball variety which generally indicate a north\"ish\" direction most of the time. The fire stone works to create sparks, and the gauze or cotton from the swabs could serve as fire-starting material. I'm not sure about the usefulness of the multifunction card, which doesn't seem hard enough to actually serve all of its intended purposes. The items are not high-end alloy or designed for daily use by special forces, but you're not paying enough for that level with a kit like this; everything seems serviceable.Where I wish the kit had more focus on the first aid side of things. There are a bunch of regular and knuckle bandages, some wipes, a small roll of gauze, narrow tape, and plastic tweezers, but not much else. I would want more in a first aid kit I traveled and camped with. Fortunately the case has some room (believe it or not!) and could accommodate a few added small items like gauze pads, antibiotic ointment, or anti-itch cream without trouble.All-in-all, a reasonable kit for the price with some handy in-a-pinch kind of tools in a nice, compact package that will travel well in the back of the car.",
