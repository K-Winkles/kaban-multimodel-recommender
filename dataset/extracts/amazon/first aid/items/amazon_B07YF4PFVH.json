I wrap them in a towel and apply to the back of my arms. They work so nicely! Just squeeze them, wait for a pop, and shake. They will be cold instantly but not biting cold like pure ice.My only negative is the coldness does run out pretty fast- within 10-15 minutes I'd say. But, overall, they are convenient and a great thing to have on hand!",

Squeezing from front to back was difficult but from the side worked very well with little effort. It stayed quite cold for just over 5 minutes, which is about what I would expect from a conventional freezer pack of that size. Hope the other 5 work as well.",
