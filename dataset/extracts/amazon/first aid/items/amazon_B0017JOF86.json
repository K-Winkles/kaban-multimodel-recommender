I can reliably report that this product gives GREAT coverage. Doesn't sweat off. It is very flexible but doesnt crack. It will peel at edges with repeated handwashing and wiping. Easy to re-coat. Skin tear on my hand happened two days after tear on forearm, hand tear healed almost invisibly in 3 days. Skin tear on arm still not healed and will have a scar. This is a must have product.",

My husband's fingers get cracked right on their tips from washing dishes, etc., and a bandaid just will not stay on the finger. I don't like to put a bandaid over my nail polish, so if I have a hang nail, this is great for protecting it long enough that it begins to heal on its own.A word of caution - It may seem thick when you pull out the brush from the bottle, but it will run all over the place if you don't brush some of it off before applying. Several thin coats, with drying time in between, are better than one \"thick\" coat, which tends to spread beyond the intended area, which wastes the product. It sort of feels like super glue, but it dries clear and can be washed off. It WILL sting a bit when you apply the first coat, but subsequent coats do not hurt nearly as much.Now that I've discovered this product for those \"high traffic\" wound areas, I will never be without it again. It's the perfect solution for small cuts or cracks that cannot hold a bandaid, but desperately need protection.",

The product is easy to apply and seems to help in the awkward location, but it will be used only as a last resort in the future.",
