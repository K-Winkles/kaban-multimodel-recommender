These fit that need.While I cannot attest to their performance as we have yet to have a need for them. We did open one up to inspect the contents. There is enough cream for smaller injuries and the cream looks as if it will do a decent job.The guys and gals were happy to have these to place in their medical kits. We had extras left over and have placed them in each of our vehicle med kits as well as camp trailer kits.This is one of those products that hope to never have to use, but if needed will be great to have at hand. So, as we did not use them I cannot say with surety that it works as expected. But it is handy and will take up absolutely no room. Better to have some around than not.",
