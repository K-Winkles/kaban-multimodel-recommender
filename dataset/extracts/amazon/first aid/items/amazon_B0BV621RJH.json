The correct way is to cover the wound surface with band-aid or medicine first, and then wrap it with gauze. Will it cause rashes and allergies? Our gauze is non-toxic, tasteless, chemical-free and latex-free. Does not cause rashes and allergies. Is the length of gauze really 4.1 yards? The unified specification of the industry is: the length after pulling is measured as the length of gauze. The length of our gauze can reach 4.5 yards after being pulled up. Is this sterile gauze? No, this is not sterile gauze. These gauze are produced and packed in a dust-free environment. They are clean enough, but they are not sterile.",

                "reviewText": "If you're doing daily dressing changes or just need something to hold something in place, these are great. They are not the 6 ply stuff you get from the hospitals, but WAY cheaper. When we needed that extra absorption, we just use two. They are a good width to cover larger areas... we were doing daily dressing changes on a small child's thigh... These worked well. I do recommend though not putting them directly on an open wound or the healing process may grow through the fabric. We used adaptic, and extra square gauze pieces when the wound was weeping more. We still use adaptic in some of the smaller open areas, but no longer have to add extra guaze. This product is very good to use, provides some streach, and covers a large amount. Good Luck!",

Each roll is individually wrapped. They seem a bit light on material but work perfect. The length is good so they make a great outer wrap for an Israeli bandage. Good purchase at a great price",

I got enough of these for 2 weeks and one other product. That their company wanted me to pay $700. Well, I don't take being screwed. I came here and looked at the same products and was very happy to find the same products and my cost was nothing like that. I got several months of wraps for less than that deal. I have found a lot of things for my health and not an insurance scam. Thank you Amazon",
