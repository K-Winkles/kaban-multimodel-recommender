                "reviewText": "Keeping a bandage on the tip of your finger is difficult. These work just OK. Once the sticky part of the bandage touches something, it loses its stickiness if you need to move it (so don't let an end touch your skin or part of the bandage until it's where you want it). One time, a bandage went flying when I threw a ball for my dog. But overall, I am satisfied.",
