                "reviewText": "Listen, as an adult, it's still fun to have brightly colored bandages. I actually wish the blue was even brighter, and would prefer fewer black bandages just to have more fun colors.The knuckle and fingertip shapes are really useful and the biggest reason I like these bandages. They adhere really well and I much prefer fabric over plastic. However, the adhesion is kind of a one-shot deal. If you don't get the alignment right and need to pull it off, the second \"stick\" will be far weaker and the bandage will peel off a lot faster. The fabric tends to unravel a bit at the edges throughout the day as well. But I haven't found any bandages that don't do that, so this is my go-to set of bandages at this time.",

                "reviewText": "I long ago gave up on the plastic strip bandages and switched to fabric. Besides the fabric, I look for great adhesion, and a large pad. Well this brand and series is the closest I've come to perfect that you can still get, and get 2 1/2 of those three things right.These bandages STICK. There's not a whole lot else to say except they do the job very well in that department. The pad size is decent, not awesome, but since the fabric is so sturdy and the adhesive is so good, I can live with it. I have definitely found my go-to bandage and have ordered these a number of times now thanks to my house full of kids.Highly recommended.",

The bandage would have lasted that long, but I preferred to change it to clean the wound and then put a new bandage on. After the third bandage change, I realized that the bandage was peeling off the top layer of my skin and caused another bad wound!Any way, they are nice and strong bandages, but be careful of bandage changes!",

I don\u2019t recommend putting on sensitive skin or trying to rip off before it\u2019s ready. The adhesive is strong and I did tear some skin off on my thigh\u2026 then used a bigger bandage and left it alone to heal.",

Especially useful for one whose hands are always in motion. The unusual colors were a nice change from typically drab flesh-toned ones. Box should last a long time but would purchase again.",
