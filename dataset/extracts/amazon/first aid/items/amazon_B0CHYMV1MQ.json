I like having kits readily available in my cars and at home \"just in case,\" as well as one in my backpack for when I'm out on hikes, camping, etc. The quality of the items in this kit (as well as of the case itself) is not top-notch, but for overall value, you get a lot of useful supplies in a fairly compact kit. The case itself, while clearly not made of the best materials, is decent and certainly something you'll be able to keep replenishing and using for some time. The size is ideal for use at home or keep in your cars. It is a little large to take on hikes. I've not carefully inspected all of the various items. I did try the band aids, and they are clearly not on par with Band-Aid similar brands, but they are still useful, and you get a good assortment. I expect most of the supplies to be useful when needed even if their quality is similar to that of the band aids. Again, for the price, you're getting great value. As I use supplies up, I may opt to get name-brand items to replace them.",

                "reviewText": "This kit is a good choice as a family first aid starter kit. Or as a resupply of dressings, protective pads, etc. when you're restocking an existing kit. Where it comes up a little light is medications.As a background, I'm a serious adventurer that goes off the grid for 7 to 10 days at a time. These trips are sometimes part of; hiking/backpacking, Kayaking, or bicycling. Based on my experiences, I try to carry items, such as this first aid kit, that anticipates injuries or other occurrences that need medications or treatments during these trips. I plan to be self-sufficient.The bandages/pads included in kit provide a bare minimum for what you should carry for day-to-day injuries that can be expected. This includes medium sized 2 3/4\" x 3/4\" band aids, 2\"x 2\" gauze pads, a 3\" x 15' roll of gauze conforming wrap, sterile eye pads, knuckle bandages, and tape.Importantly simple items for cleaning and prepping the wound or scrape prior to applying these bandages is also in the kit: Soap pads, Alcohol pads and a good selection of cotton swabs for dabbing and removing debris. It also includes Iodine pads which is an antiseptic typically used during cleaning. All Very good.A small set of treatment options are included: Sting relief pads and burn pads. A chemical Ice pack for twists and sprains is included but for me in most cases would be optional. For family vacations I would probably recommend bringing it.As a good starter kit, you also get supporting accessories that are frequently needed to address these common injuries when you're out in field, camping or otherwise away from home. This includes scissors, Tweezers, gloves, and an arm sling. A Tourniquet and a CPR mask are included for the rarer life-threatening issues that can happen.The kit includes all of these items which are very much required and useable. What is missing is medications. Specifically: A triple antibiotic lotion, Suntan lotion, Insect repellent, eye drops and Hydrocortisone for skin irritations such as poison ivy. I may also add an Ace bandage. In my opinion these items are needed in the kit. During my trips these are some of the more useful and used items I carry. And will have to be added to this kit.I should note the kit includes some items that are usually considered part of a survival kit: a small flashlight, the multifunctional saber card which replaces mainly a Swiss army knife, a whistle and an emergency blanket which could be used for cold temperatures or treatment for shock situations. These are also items that should be carried when your camping, hiking or out in the field but a noted really belong in a separate survival kit. I would have exchanged these items for some of the missing items in this first aid kit - but this is my opinion based on the types of trips I take.This kit is a good place to start for a traveling first aid kit. It includes many of the items that should be carried in every family first aid kit. These include items for minor cuts, scrapes, bites, burns, splinters, twisted ankle and arm injuries. But it is not perfect and for a few more dollars you can complete the kit. In my opinion, the price is a little expensive for what you get. There are other options.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very small travel kit but it is packed full. It has a lot of bandages in it and decent quality bandage scissors and whistle. It's a good little kid when space is at a premium. I think it's good for a vehicle and I like that it had a mylarr blanket in it. You might want to add some individual packs of things like Benadryl, something to address Bee sting pain/allergies, maybe some Neosporin.I'm finding that this is a very handy kit to keep it my elderly father's bedside. I added to Neosporin and I can grab this to make it quick and easy to address little scratches and places where he picks it himself. This has a lot of smaller bandages in it. He often has little boo boos that are less than a centimeter long but he's on blood thinner so he bleeds a lot, and these bandages are great for that. The little scissors you come in handy a time or two when we've needed to remove a disposable undy from him quickly. The red color is easy to spot on the shelf and the little clamshell case keeps everything inside nice and neat.",

This kit is pretty good and comes with all the essentials. It's not entirely the highest quality stuff but it's good enough for an emergency situation. You certainly couldn't buy these pieces individually for less. The kit doesn't take up much space. Overall, I think this kit is a good value and would recommend it.",
