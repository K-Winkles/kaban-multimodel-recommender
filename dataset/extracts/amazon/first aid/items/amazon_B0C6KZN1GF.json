                "reviewText": "I gifted this to my sister and her boyfriend for Christmas and they loved it! It had everything they need and it was really packed tightly into the compact bag. The bag was smaller than I thought but everything was inside. The material of the bag is sturdy and had a ton of Velcro and areas to clip on. They were so excited to receive this gift because the bag is compatible with their new camping backpacks and will hook on to the backpack perfectly. I was disappointed to find he Q-tips inside the bag were dirty like they had been used already. Maybe a manufacturing error?",
