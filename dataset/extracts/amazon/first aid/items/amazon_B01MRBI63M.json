Instead of students coming up to me anytime they need a bandaid or ice pack for small things they go to the class doctor (they still come to me if they are sick or have a big problem). I invested in these small first aid kits to hold band-aids and the doctor/s have them strategically placed around the classroom so they can easily get to them. Students love taking ownership of helping a friend while being the doctor. These containers came with a few bandaids and other supplies, we only keep bandaids in them and refill as needed.",
