Early in the Covid-19 pandemic (back in March/April), I was unusually more distracted and clumsy when leaving home to search (i.e., shop) for food and household products all while having to remember to wear a mask. Stress makes us clumsy; and I was for a moment. I accidently closed the car door on my thumb - ouch! Yes, it left an awful bruise, swelling and eventually the death of the thumb nail. During the next 6 months as the nail died and grew out, it was important that I keep the nail bed and cuticle clean and calm to usher in the new, healthy nail. Because I love to cook and my Sunday hobby is baking, protecting the thumb and keeping clean in the kitchen was very important to me. Again, these nitrile finger cots are awesome! Clean, water proof, covers the entire thumb/finger, comfortable (not tight or restrictive), and did not interfere with my ability to handle cooking tools and utensils. I wore one when washing my hair to keep from snagging my hair with the lose nail - terrific. The finger cots also protected the finger from cleaning and drying agents (bleach, soap, etc) and allowed my thumb to health as expected. There are plenty of finger cots in the box. Easy to roll onto the finger. I highly recommend this product.",
