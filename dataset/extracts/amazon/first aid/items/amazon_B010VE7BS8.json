                "reviewText": "Used this as the base \"pad\" when my dog got a cut and stitches on his leg. Much better than \"normal\" (string-y) gauze pads that get tangled with the stitches. These are THICK and SOFT and NONSTICK. I also love that they're individually wrapped. I recommend this gauze as a \"base\" layer, then following it with your choice of wrap(s) on top. For my dog's leg, I used a stretchy non-woven gauze roll then coflex self-adhesive wrap on top and it was all very easily changed out daily. Will absolutely buy these again and in other sizes.",
