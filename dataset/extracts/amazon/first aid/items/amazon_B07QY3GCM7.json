                "reviewText": "Alright moms and dads. I\u2019m a mom of 3 kids, 4.5 years old and younger. I\u2019m always looking for the next best thing when it comes to making my life easier/their health better. My middle child is a wild man and gets hurt A LOT. He also has an irrational fear of bandaids of really anything that will make him feel better. I read the reviews on this, rolled my eyes and purchased anyway. I\u2019m honestly amazed at the results. It truly is no sting, I tried it on myself so I can attest. My son will get a scrape and I\u2019ll clean it the best I can and then spray this on. My daughter started crawling and was dragging her chunky little leg over bluestone at my sister in law\u2019s house and scraped her leg up from it. I started spraying this on every diaper change and right before I put her pajamas on for the night. It\u2019s been two days and the skin is completely healed. You can absolutely see the difference. I was also having issues with her pesky diaper rash and I use triple paste all day every day. I started spraying this on and bam, by the evening the red skin was a slight pink and by morning it was gone! I\u2019m an instant fan of this product. I really want to see what else they have. The price is for sure steep considering how much neosporin costs but I swear this is worth every penny!!!",

I also felt like my wound healed up quicker than it normally would have which was an added bonus. Worth the try and cost.",
