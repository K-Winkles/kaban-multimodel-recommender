I grabbed these straps, cleaned the area and closed the wound back up.When I got to the ER, the Dr looked at it and said, \"Its not bleeding. you did a great job. That's better than what we would've done here.\" He didn't even put gloves on. Just said good job several times and discharged me. That tells me two things. 1. These things work. And 2. I'm about to get a massive bill for walking through the ER and basically saying hi....",

I am super active so I didn't want to chance it and added two bandaids to the outer edges. I checked it after a day and probably didn't need them. The butterfly bandage is still intact and the zip ties held great. I am able to re-apply Neo-sporin between the zip ties so as not to keep irritating the wound. I would highly recommend. In fact, I bought a few more to have on hand. Great product!!!",
