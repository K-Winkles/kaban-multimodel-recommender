                "reviewText": "After observing me using the work first aid kit to re-bandage a cut from one of my weekend diy activities, a friend of mine mentioned that it was odd, how in silicon valley, everyone used the work first aid kit for everything from minor scrapes to painkillers; anything, really. I've been working here for going on two decades, so I thought this was the case everywhere. And it got me thinking; it's super convenient to have a first aid kit nailed to the wall. I searched around, and to get the one we've got at work, it'd be about 3x the price; this one looks to be just as good and convenient, maybe more so, because there are some large panels in the doors where you could put in extra stuff, and the price is super low.It is obviously plastic, and probably wont last as long as the metal boxes, but eh, I've got it screwed to an ikea wardrobe; that thing isn't going to last forever, either. And it is cheaper and better organized than the metal boxes I've seen on amazon or at work.The first time I opened it, I thought I broke the catch, but if you look on the side of one of the front panels, it's got a little sticker mentioning that it's a safety catch, designed to come apart if someone tries to open the kit with too much enthusiasm. I followed the instructions and put the little lever back where it belonged, and the thing was as good as new.It has even got a paper 'pattern' you know, like when you are sewing something. You put this paper over the wall where you want to hang the kit, then you put screws in through the paper at the marked points, leaving them protruding just a little. rip the paper off (or leave it, I guess) and then slide the box on. No measuring required.The contents are office quality; I will probably replace the bandages with cloth bandages, but that's okay. Most of it I will use as-is.",
