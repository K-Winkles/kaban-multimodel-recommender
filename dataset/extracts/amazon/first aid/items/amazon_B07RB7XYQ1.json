This is my first time trying the Solimo brand. WOW. Although you can't see it, even after the alcohol dries, it leaves behind an invisible residue that has a STRONG, unpleasant taste. I'd cleaned a knife, went to use it to cut a fruit, and noticed a strong unpleasant acidic taste. Even though the knife was dry AND I had manually double dried it with paper towels. The residue was still there. Definitely don't use this rubbing alcohol on any tools or utensils that will go in your mouth. I've never had this happen with other generic brands from the store.Plus, the smell is terrible in general. This alcohol works in a pinch, but I'll never order this brand again.",
