                "reviewText": "This first aid kit is fairly complete, but the alcohol pads were completely dried out. As there's no antibiotic ointment either, you'll want to resupply all the perishable bits when you first get it. There's also no splint, which I've added to my camping first aid kit. (Knock on wood: so far I've never needed anything but bandaids and antibiotic ointment) The instant ice pack is a good addition, although I didn't try it to see if it actually cooled.The dynamo flashlight is a nice bonus and worked when we used it at home. It's cheaply made, but it'd be a backup to a cell phone flashlight and no worry about the batteries being dead.I have no training outside of first aid, so I can't evaluate this kit's use as a trauma kit.",
