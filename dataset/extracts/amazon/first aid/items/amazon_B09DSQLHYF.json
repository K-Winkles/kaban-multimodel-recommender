I put together first aid survival kids for my kids and a couple friends and gave them as a gift for Christmas. Loved that it actually has first aid on the front with the symbol - no need to second guess what bag your grabbing. Had enough pockets to sort the basics. Quality seems a bit on the cheap side but they are holding up well and have no complaints. Would order again and just might be in the near future.",

Hopefully you're only using these pouches for everyday \"ouchies\" like when your kid scrapes his knee at the park, and not life-saving emergencies. In the latter case, having a zipper jam when you're trying to open this is NOT what you want to have happen. (I guess in that case you could just rely on adrenaline and break the heck out of the zipper to bust the pouch open.)That said, these are decent pouches overall and I'm satisfied with them for my purposes. They have enough pockets inside, and they're the right size to hold the basics you'd want to have for everyday use. I filled each of mine with all the following items:\u2022 1 pouch of BleedStop powder\u2022 5 packs of single-use Neosporin\u2022 3 tubes of single-use eye drops\u2022 3 packs of single-use antiseptic wipes\u2022 5 each of small, medium, and large bandages\u2022 3 extra large bandages\u2022 3 knuckle bandagesThere's definitely room if I wanted to add a few more items like gauze or a pair of vinyl gloves.",

                "reviewText": "As another reviewer said (and I wish I'd read their comments before buying these!!) the pouches have a GREAT capacity but a MAJOR design flaw. The excess fabric near the zipper makes it catch every single time I've opened it. As the other review said, not a big deal if this is for everyday \"ouches\", but I bought these specifically for life-threatening bleeding situations because I have a prosthetic heart valve and am on 2 blood thinners, but I am a very active 20-something. I would need access to the BleedStop and kaolin bandages inside IMMEDIATELY. Overall these are cheaply made, but again, very good capacity. Just be advised to look for another option if you were to rely on anything in this pouch to save a life, like epi pens.",

I wanted to fill them with travel size items, such as hair ties, hand sanitizer, face hydrating mask, Advil, mini lotion, tums etc\u2026.1 out of the 4 was properly made. The others were so miss shaped that they weren\u2019t rectangles. They couldn\u2019t be zipped up, the pockets inside were not sewn correctly. They were terrible. Basically not useable. We were leaving the next day so I didn\u2019t have time to replace them through Amazon. I found some others locally, but was disappointed with what this store had to offer. Such a disappointment. I guess you get what you pay for.",

It was nice to have one small little organizer for each of them. Very economical also.",
