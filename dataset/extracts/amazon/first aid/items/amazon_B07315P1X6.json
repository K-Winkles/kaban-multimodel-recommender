                "reviewText": "I whave a large scar on my leg left over from a biopsy that should have been done by a plastic surgeon rather than a primary care Dr. The scar is pretty big and I\u2019m self conscious about it. This tape has helped reduce the appearance of the scar in the short time I\u2019ve been using it. You get a decent sized roll for the $. It sticks well to the skin but it is not hard to remove when you need to take it off to apply a new piece. I left it on in the shower and it still stayed stuck to me. It is also super easy to cut into the shape of the scar you are trying to treat. Definitely worth picking some up if you are wanting to reduce the appearance of your scars.",

Once you begin peeling it from the backing, it immediately begins to roll up on itself and it's hard to separate. You'll need to separate a very small area from the backing and place it on your scar before you totally remove it from the backing to finish the application.",

                "reviewText": "I really like having a first aid kit that has a large varied selection of first aid emergency supplies. This kit comes in a red, zippered, light weight, durable, easy to open, case that is clearly marked FIRST AID. The case even has a small loop to attach a provided carabiner then the kit could be hooked to a back pack, belt loop or sports equipment. I attached the carabiner and I plan on keeping this kit in my car. The compact design allows it to be easily be stored. This case holds an impressive amount of supplies for its size. Here is the list of supplies - 1 Carabiner \u2022 1 First aid brochure \u2022 1 Scissors \u2022 1 Tweezers \u2022 2 Vinyl gloves \u2022 1 Emergency whistle \u2022 1 Cotton triangular bandage \u2022 1 Combine dressing \u2022 30 Adhesive Bandages Small \u2022 30 Adhesive Bandages Large \u2022 30 Butterfly closure bandages \u2022 5 Knuckle bandage \u2022 5 Knee/elbow bandage \u2022 2 Gauze pads (4\u201dx4\u201d) \u2022 4 Gauze pads (3\u201dx3\u201d) \u2022 5 Gauze pads (2\u201dx2\u201d) \u2022 1 First aid tape roll \u2022 1 Conforming bandage \u2022 10 Fingertip bandages \u2022 5 Safety pins \u2022 1 Instant cold pack \u2022 2 Eye pads.I was pleased to see that items that carry an expiration date have a long shelf life. The case is designed to keep all these items organized. The left side has a deep clear pocket. The right has a flip down pocket that has the First Aid brochure in it (a good place to put some cash and personal emergency information). There is enough space in this case that I was able to add a few items. This is what I added - a couple cleansing wipes, antiseptic wipes, bee sting ampules, and emergency blanket. I included a picture with items added to show \"extras fit\".",
