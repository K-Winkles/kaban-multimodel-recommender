                "reviewText": "If you\u2019re looking for a full First Aid Kit, complete with everything from a tourniquet to a surgical kit, take a pass. This First Aid Kit isn\u2019t meant to be a full kit, but rather one that can be used at home or at work. There\u2019s a small pocket guide to First Aid, which is essentially a folded piece of paper with the basics. I\u2019ve taken a Red Cross first aid training course, but if I don\u2019t have a kit like this, I\u2019m very limited as to what I can do. I am, however, very impressed with how well put together this kit actually is.I have a molle bag setup with critical emergency supplies, supplies a paramedic could actually make use of. This bag is a high-quality, solid one, that holds a lot. The zippers are synthetic and glide easily. No need to treat them with graphite. The double zippers are metal and easy to grab, especially with the zipper pulls. There\u2019s piping around the edges of the kit to ensure it won\u2019t fall apart. The bag has different carry options and can be attached to a belt or clipped to a backpack.With a full 130 pieces, it\u2019s got a bit of everything one might need. I was impressed with the variety, including the fact there\u2019s an emergency blankets and small vial of saline included. If you have any specialized medical needs, there is some duplication. Some items can be removed and others can be put in their place. Very nice First Aid Kit that\u2019s definitely worth the asking price of around $16. It\u2019s a bargain actually!",

                "reviewText": "The First Aid Case covers the first important element for this type of product. The red color, with white piping and lettering makes it very easy to find and identify. In an emergency, you want to be able to locate the first aid kit asap.The case is literally stuffed with various supplies. They cover the basics, with some additional goodies. Besides the usual complement of bandages and gauze pads, they supply an analog compass, scissors, tweezers, safety pins and carabiner. While they do not include an antiseptic, they do include saline solution which can be used to wash out a scrape or cut. I'm also impressed that they include a cold compress product and an emergency thermal (mylar) blanket. This blanket is handy, especially to assist someone that might be in shock.The addition of the analog compass enhances the worth of this kit for camping or hiking. But, the relatively compact form makes this ideal to keep in the car, or to take along on a cookout/picnic or outdoor outing. I would include a few more 'essential' first aid supplies, to deal with burns and antiseptic application. However, the product details does provide a very clear, detailed listing of the contents. The product is exactly as described and shown in the product details.Based on very favorable initial impressions, this First Aid Kit earns a 4.75 - 5 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",

                "reviewText": "This first aid kit is compact and yet pretty comprehensive. It has a great assortment of essential emergency supplies such as bandages, gauze pads, first aid tools and some survival tools as well. Notably, these also include saline solution, instant cold pack, emergency blanket, CPR mask, tourniquet and compress. The supplies and tools are of good quality and serviceable. You can add an antibiotic ointment and some pain killers to complete the kit.This kit comes in a compact and well-made double zipper soft case. It is about 6.75\" x 5 x 2.5\" in size, highly portable and has both a belt loop and a plastic clip for easy carrying. The belt loop is detachable on one end with a snap button for closure. There is also a reflective strip on the front for personal safety in low-light conditions.Overall, this is a great first aid kit. Compact, pretty full and highly portable. It is great to have in the car, hiking, boating, camping, etc. Also handy in home and office. Mine has an manufacture date of just 2 months ago and a 5-year shelf life. Made in China. It is pretty well priced. A good value for the money. Recommended.",

I would recommend something in a better case (thicker, better zippers, something that opens flat for easier access, doesn\u2019t have cheap plastic holding materials in) for putting in your vehicle, travel bag, or anywhere else it would actually get used and will hold up.",

There's even a face shield to use if you're performing CPR and need to give rescue breaths. Every item in this kit is useful and practical for any emergency or situation you may have. I'll need to get one more to have on my car because you can never be too prepared. Some things I may never use like the emergency blanket and carabiner, but I'd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it. The bandages have good adhesive to them and the tweezers are perfect for use with getting out splinters. The pouch is very waterproof as I've tested it out and had no water entering the inside of it. Very good resource to have and worth the price. Definitely recommend having in your home or while you're out and about.",
