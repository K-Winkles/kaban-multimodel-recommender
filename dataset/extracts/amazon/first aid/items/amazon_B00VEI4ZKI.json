It seems to be almost as waterproof as the old version. I haven't used it to tape bandages or dressing and I don't think it would work well for that.For people who have commented that its hard to get the tape out of the spool when it gets low, please know that the two sides of the plastic spool can come apart by twisting and pulling apart, then the tape can be removed, just like the old version ;-)",

With hidradenitis suppurativa you break out in sensitive areas (Groin, private parts, bre@sts, armpits, etc.) and you need tape that\u2019s gonna stay or else\u2026 it\u2019s gonna be a mess.I tried this for a breakout under my bre@st. It stayed when I had a bra on but when my girls were free that\u2019s a different story.
