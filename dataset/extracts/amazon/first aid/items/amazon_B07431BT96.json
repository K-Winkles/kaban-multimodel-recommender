                "reviewText": "I bought this kit because it sounded like it was complete and then some. I hope I never need it but I bought it to replace a previous kit for my car as I do a lot of travel. I needed a couple band aids for my young son recently and found that my old kit was soaked in some kind of liquid destroying most of the contents. This kit is portable, has items in it that usually aren't included in other kits (small compass for example in case you are not in an urban environment). It is packed with different emergency supplies. It even comes with a blanket. Unlike most kits they thought of a lot of useful functions. It's in a easily carry case with handles and could even pack it in a suitcase if necessary. I would have dumped previous kits everywhere. This one is so compact it is just slightly too big to put in my glove box, so size makes a difference. If you are in the market, make a comparison. I think you will be impressed with this kit as well.",

                "reviewText": "I can recommend this kit to anyone looking for a modestly priced first aid kit for home or car, and intend to buy a second one (for my husband's car).The case was reasonably sturdy, and I liked the reflective tape (easy to find in an emergency). It was also well-stocked, with enough room to add more items (a big plus). I added to it: an American Red Cross First Aid booklet, quick-clot bandanges, a cord you could use for a tourniquet, aspirin, ibuprofin, and benadryl. Had to send away for the American Red Cross First Aid booklet, since what the kit had was inadequate -- I'd like them add the book in the future. I then drew up an alphabetical list of what the kit contained, and in which pocket, and when it should be replaced, and attached that to the outside of the kit for quick reference in an emergency. I slipped into each pocket an alpha list of what was in that pocket -- again, for quick reference in an emergency.I also listed each item in the kit (in alpha order), along with which pocket the item was in (and the expiration date of the item) and rubber-banded it to the outside of the kit. If someone's stopped breathing or bleeding out, you don't want to have to upend the entire kit to find what a CPR mask, gloves or wound gauze. Likewise, you need to know when to rotate or replace items.I also slipped into each pocket of the kit an inventory of what was in the pocket (listed alphabetically), then put the entire kit into a backpack, since it's going into my car and I want to be able to find it quickly (instead of losing the kit amongst the junk in my trunk).",
