It should have everything you need in it for the most part including a variety of bandages and gauze, tweezers, scissors, and even sting relief pads which are especially helpful if you are out camping or backpacking. I am a mosquito magnet so I took out a few items and added in anti itch cream and a little bottle of bug spray. This is super lightweight, weights less than a pound and is compact so it is easy to store and carry around. The only thing that could make this better is if the scissors were stronger, but overall I love this product!",

                "reviewText": "Has everything you'll probably want, but I personalized this kit to go in my EDC bag. Everyone's needs are different so I took out several redundant items like excess alcohol wipes or prep pads and their brand of bandaids, then added back my preferred Nexcare bandaids in various sizes instead. Kept a few different sizes of the gauze pads, one tape, tweezers, maybe a few other items. Didn't need the triangle bandage which took up a lot of space since that's an easy to improvise item that doesn't need to be sterile and kept the glove.Added a couple of safety pins, a small pill tube, a tube of bug repellant, tube of benadryl, and two tiny Krazy glue tubes for closing wounds. Those fit nicely on the zippered mesh side. The whistle was actually pretty nice; and although I carry a much louder one, this will be good to have in a medical kit. I thought it was strange that the embossed \"cross\" on the outside of the case (indicating that this was a medical kit) was the same color as the case, so you couldn't even see it, yet their logo was big, in red, and very visible. Kind of defeats the purpose of the cross. So I whipped out my label maker and made a tape saying \"First Aid\" and a couple of other tapes with my name/phone # and an emergency contact/phone # and stuck those on the outside of both sides of the case.Pros:I like that it opens clamshell style. Easier to see what you need right away, and I like the semi hard shell case which will protect the contents. Has plenty of very useful items if you don't want to bother personalizing the kit and probably has a bit of room to add some of your own.Cons:The scissors were a joke, so traded those for a small pair of hemostats that has many more useful functions. I carry several knives, so don't need the blunt bandage scissors that only perform one function.My biggest disappointment was that I ordered red and got a black one. I will end up keep this one in my car and will probably order another one from someone else who can hopefully tell the difference in the two colors. I want the color medical kit to stand out from everything else in my bag, so no one has to hunt for it. And I'd like it if the universally recognized cross symbol was white and much more prominent.UPDATE: I just realized that it was my error on ordering the wrong color and I feel obligated to apologize for my snide remark above. The seller offered to send me a red case, but since it was not his mistake, I can't in all honesty accept it. I am impressed by the companies attentiveness since I did not solicit a replacement or even email the seller with my complaint. I've raised my rating to 4 stars but I do feel that the kit could have had a better selection of items and a better quality of scissors (which I ditched) for the cost. The case itself is great.",
