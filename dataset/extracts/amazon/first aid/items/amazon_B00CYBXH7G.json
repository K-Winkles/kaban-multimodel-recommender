I plan on keeping this kit in a trunk in case of emergencies.I removed 1 star as the sterile packages have no manufacturing or expiration dates.This price is extremely affordable. I wish more antibiotic ointment came with this kit.Cons: No expiration dates. Tongue depressors are junk,l and not even individually wrapped. Gloves are loose in the package I will add my own sterile gloves to the kit.",
