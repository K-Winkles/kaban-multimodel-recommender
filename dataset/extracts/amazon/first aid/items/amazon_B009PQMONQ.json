                "reviewText": "I ordered this for my emergency first aid kit. Our family is always outside whenever possible, we love to go camping, fishing, etc, so I thought this was important to have in my kit. My husband also works with wood and is always complaining of having something in his eye. I haven't had to use this yet, but plan on ordering more, one for my car and another just to have on hand. The price was good and shipping was very fast. When its needed, I'll be glad I have it, and feel better knowing I do. When I talk to family and friends about having first aid supplies on hand, I will definitely recommend this. Better to be safe than sorry. You never know when you may need this, especially with kids and a husbnd like mine!",

Today I received my 3 eye wash bottles in the same box as Ant Bait which warns about contamination with eyes, hands, mouth etc. and other precautions. I will not use this eye wash because it was inside the same shipment with no separation from the ant bait container, rolling around in the same package, unless someone can assure in writing that it is safe to use. If not, I will throw away the eye wash and order again.",
