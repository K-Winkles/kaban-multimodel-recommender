We bought this for the easy of reordering supplies. It did fall off the wall (not the products fault but ours) and dented a bit. Everything was in place and it\u2019s pretty sturdy so far.",

I kept the cardboard display box and changed mine out with good ones. The rest of the kit seems well made. I added some Narcan to mine and it's screwed into the wall in my laundry room so anyone can get to it.. get yourself a LifeVac and you'll be set. A little security goes along way and this one is a win. Looks nice on the wall in my home too.",
