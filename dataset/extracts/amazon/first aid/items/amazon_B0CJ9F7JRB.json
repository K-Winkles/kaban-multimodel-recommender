                "reviewText": "Finally a medical kit that appears to be put together by a real medical professional. Most medical kits are stuffed with many nonsense items just to raise the number of 'items' in the kit. This kit provides you a box full of useful items to get you through most medical situations from the simple boo boo to CPR.I love how they decided to put this kit together. Statistically, you are going to have the most minor boo boos, so you get plenty of sterile gauze, tape, band-aids, and a triple-antibiotic ointment. Also, in the kit, you are provided with a few items to help with more serious and unexpected medical issues. You have a CPR mask, rubber tourniquet, emergency blanket, cold compress, and burn ointment. You have enough material to isolate an arm injury, and if you know what you're doing, you can make a leg splint in a pinch. Not mentioned in the product 'item' list, but I'll go one step further. The center divider can be sized quickly with the scissors to make an emergency seal for a sucking chest wound.I absolutely love this kit and it is durable enough to restock and continue to use. Each of the items in the kit are useful and are a must-have in any home medical kit. There are no wasted products here.The kit even comes with a mini travel bag. It's already stocked to deal with any minor scraps and cuts. It's perfect for keeping in the car, work desk drawer, or at your child's sporting event. There are plenty more items in the kit than I can't mention in a simple review like tweezers that can handle splinters and ticks. Moleskin for blisters and abrasions, finger splints and many more items.Overall, this product gets an A+ in my book. I will be hanging this up on the wall in my home, so it is easily accessible whenever it is needed. I know I can count on it to have whatever I need for whatever issue comes up. I highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I am a medical doctor (specifically, an orthopedic surgeon), so, in theory, I should know what I\u2019m talking about in reviewing this product. We have a few, similar kits that we keep in the house, cars, etc and I\u2019ve got a bin of things I\u2019ve brought home for work. I\u2019ve never seen a first aid kit, though, that has this much \u201cstuff.\u201d It says 360 pieces, and it really does seem like it has that many things in it - it\u2019s incredible, especially considering that the box itself isn\u2019t huge (a little bigger than most first aid kits, but not much). It\u2019s 9\u201dx 9\u201dx 3\u201d which is about like a flattened out lunch box.Now, the quality of the gauze, band aids, instruments inside are average at best and are certainly not something that I would use in my office or in the operating room. However, they are reasonable and will do the job. I tried out the scissors and some of the gauze, cotton swabs, etc and they would be fine to use at home, especially in an urgent/emergent situation. The tape is very thin and poor quality, though, and I only saw two small rolls. Not a deal breaker, but more and better tape would be nice.Most of the 360 pieces are gauze, band aids, alcohol wipes, and cotton swabs but there are also some bigger ABD pads, wraps, an ice pack, bandage scissors, tweezers, antiseptic ointment, cotton balls, tongue depressors, and even safety pins. There\u2019s a little booklet that covers some emergency basics. There\u2019s even another little side first aid kit, that\u2019s the size of a coin purse, stuffed with products, that could go in a purse, glove box, etc.I asked my wife (who\u2019s an ER nurse) how much she thought this first aid kit cost and she said \u201c$80.\u201d I think that would probably be a little high, considering that quality of the products inside, but for $19.99 this is a steal and I can highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this General Medi 360 piece hardcase first aid kit to store in our van in case of emergencies. This kit is quite extensive. The hardcase is jam-packed with supplies. Everything is clearly labelled and should be easy to find quickly when needed. The kit comes with everything shown in the listing. There is also a list of items and quantities on the back of the hardcase. The hardcase is 10 inches square and 3.25 inches deep. It also has a handle for carrying. Since we are putting the kit in our van and it does get -30 degrees F here in the winter, I did notice the cold compress says to store at room temperature and the burn gel says to avoid extreme temperatures. For us those two items will have to go into my purse. Overall, this is a comprehensive first aid kit and I would highly recommend in case of emergencies.",

Enough supplies to tend to the most minor medical need or at least till professional medics can get to you. It does have a list of supplies on back of box to help with restocking. Some items have expiration dates and good for 2 years. Comes with a CPR and first aid guide if needed. I added some more triple antibiotic and ibuprofen/Tylenol packs for adults and children to it. I am pleased with the quality and quantity and will be quite handy if needed. Reasonable price for quality and quantity. Comparable to other styles and brands.",

It has a huge supply of band-aids. It also has a smaller, travel mini first aid kit inside (I took a picture of the mini first aid kit and its contents). The mini one is the perfect size for a purse or carry on. The expiration dates for the products antibiotic ointment, burn gel and wipes are all in 2028 (it's currently February 2024). The quality is decent. The box can be hung up on a wall from a handle that folds out from the top. This kit is a great value ($19.99 at the time of this review). I am happy with this product.",
