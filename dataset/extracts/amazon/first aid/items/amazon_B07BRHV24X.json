You couldn\u2019t buy the items separately for the cost of this - and there is still room to add some of your own items. Several ways to carry the kit or secure it to yourself, or even hang it when in use. The bag is sturdy and made of quality material. It does not feel cheap and the stitching and zippers feel durable. No weird smells, just perfection! Super pleased with this purchase and would definitely buy it again!",

                "reviewText": "What\u2019s in the bag.Although I don\u2019t like the survival gear because I already have those essentials, this kit is fantastic. I believe this kit is necessary if you\u2019re an outdoors person or hunt/shoot. of course I recommend you add/remove some things: remove or replace the knife, replace the tweezers with better ones, remove the flashlight, and remove any survival gear (except for 1 glow stick) to make room for more medical supplies but keep the gear because it\u2019s still good. Medical supplies I think are necessary but not included; some more sterile gauze and a tourniquet. You should have some extra room for more bleed control or specialized trauma treatment. Highly recommend researching the most common types of trauma you will face for whatever you do and find the proper supplies. If you\u2019re a frequent shooter include some chest seal and focus on bleed control but don\u2019t just take my word for it, be thorough as it could save a life.The bag itself.The bag is of great quality, materials are pretty good and the inside of the bag has some elastic straps and pockets to organize your items. The rip away Velcro system is fantastic, the Molle system is up to standard and isn\u2019t just for show. With some organizing you can set up your bag so when you open it up you can shake it upside down and NOTHING will fall out. I secure my tourniquet with a Velcro strap (neither are included) by using the elastic bands inside the pouch so it\u2019s quick to get out but still secure.Conclusion and final notes.The survival gear is of meh quality but it will work, the trauma shears work great, tested them on a work shirt and it cut through the thick fabric. The thermal blanket is necessary, if you\u2019re treating someone they\u2019re gonna want a blanket and if they\u2019re in shock from blood loss it is necessary they keep their body heat. Can also work as a shelter. Although I removed most of the survival gear I keep the thermal blanket and water resistant poncho, they are small and light. What comes in the bag is pretty thorough and good quality for the price.This kit is 10/10 for quality, 10/10 for the bag features and 9/10 for the contents of everything, points off for no tourniquet but that\u2019s my opinion.TL:DRIt\u2019s a great kit, if you want medical supplies to take anywhere with you this kit will work great.It\u2019s got great quality all around and some features I really like. Do your research and include things you feel are necessary but be thorough.I\u2019ll upload a video and some pictures soon showing my setup.",

I did customize it a little to what I need, but this comes so well stocked and with such diverse contents! I added a few things that I prefer and thinned it out a little, but it now goes on all my trips with me and has been used quite a bit. It's sturdy, and has ample supplies. I would highly recommend this for your travel medical needs. I use it on camping trips with the family, drill with the military, and keep it in my truck in the event a bystander needs it. Get prepared, be helpful and live life!",

The bag itself is well designed and constructed - it has straps for nearly any application or storage with super strong synthetic fabric, webbed belts, and Velcro. It should last a good long time.Obviously I've not opened every packet or tried to \"test\" all the contents, but looking everything over gives me confidence that we'll be well prepared for just about anything we might encounter on the road or elsewhere. The items included are sensible and appear to be of high quality. I feel more comfortable having this and a good fire extinguisher in our car.I do recommend this kit (or something similar) to everyone, as a part of one's essential safety gear. You'll be glad you have it when someone needs it.",
