The red cross bag is used for first aid, the black is use to hold instant ice and hot packs (24 ct) along with disposable barf bags (40 ct). The gray ones are used for CPAP supplies: masks, tubing, nose pillows, water chambers/plugs, headgear, filters, etc. They're an exceptional bag! I'm planning on ordering more to hold my Bauerfeind braces, and another one to hold BP monitors, Pulse Ox, etc. Highly recommend if you're looking to organize a lot of stuff but have limited storage in your home. 5+",
