It says it is for 10 people. I'm not sure how they come to that number but this set does come with lots of items. Tons of different-sized bandaids, gauze, wrap strips, gloves, q tips, antibiotic cream, burn cream, eye wash, a CPR pamphlet, you name it. It is very nice. I like to keep it in my car since I have children who seem to always need a bandaid.",

For a list of all the first aid items, look at the listing description for details. I am quite impressed with the amount of items here. I like that there are different sized bandages and burn cream. Having nitrile exam gloves \ud83e\udde4 is good because some people have latex allergies. But, why only 2 gloves? That\u2019s only enough for one person to wear on their right and left hands. I would put more gloves in this kit because you don\u2019t want cross contamination and gloves can tear easily. The plastic carrying case is white and very visible. The handle is flimsy though, and probably won\u2019t last long if it is being used. Long story short, this is a decent first aid kit. Personally, I would add a few more things to it, but it\u2019s a pretty good first aid kit and gets the job done. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude91\ud83e\ude77\ud83d\ude03\u26d1\ufe0f\ud83d\ude1c\ud83c\udfe5\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\ude1d\u26d1\ufe0f\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude91\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\ude0e\u26d1\ufe0f\ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\ude91\ud83d\udc9a\ud83e\udd14\ud83c\udfe5\ud83e\udd2a\u26d1\ufe0f\ud83d\ude03\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude91\ud83d\ude0a\u26d1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83c\udfe5\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\ude91\ud83e\udd2a\u26d1\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this first aid kit to replace the one I bought many years ago and which I'm sure contains things that are mostly expired. I was not disappointed in the assortment of first aid items contained in this small package. It has pretty much any bandage you could ever need as well as plastic gloves, antiseptic, and gauze. With kids around, you never know what you are going to need, so I will definitely take this with us on car trips and keep it handy at home the rest of the time. The only thing lacking from this kit is any sort of medicine, such as pain or stomach relief. Otherwise it is very full.",

                "reviewText": "ProHeal's 10 Person First Aid Kit has a lot packed into the box. Almost all the products are from the E+R company (Ever Ready First Aid brand), with clear labeling and earliest expiration occurring in 10/2025. Beyond the basic expected bandages, burn cream and antiseptic wipes, I was happy to see included eye wash as well as thumb forceps (would definitely be useful for my family). The box doesn't have the most professional labeling, but I do like that it has a rubber gasket to keep things dry and it has built in holes to allow it to be mounted to a wall. It does not contain oral medications, but it is good for many minor emergencies.",

                "reviewText": "This first aid kit contains all the major essentials neatly packed into a small container. The plastic container has a rubber seal so at the very least it is watertight. The contents are in individual baggies which is a nice feature. There is a generous amount of each item. The contents were all sealed and well within their expiration date.What could be improved: The front and back labels feel like they were done with an inkjet printer. Slightly nicer outer packaging would elevate this a bit. That being said, I would still say this is a 5-star first aid kit because the outer label in no way effects the functionality.",
