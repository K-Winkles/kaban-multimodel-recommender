                "reviewText": "This is an impressive array of first aid supplies (much more than was shown in the first product image), in a sturdy well-organized pack with labeled pockets. It comes packed and ready to go, and includes a thorough illustrated inventory sheet (shown in the second product image) to help you identify everything inside. The bright red ballistic nylon and bold white labeling on the exterior make it clearly identifiable as a first aid kit from a distance. I'd had a much smaller first aid kit pouch and had been acquiring supplies one-by-one locally; this is a great upgrade.In addition to a typical carrying handle, there are multiple additional options for attaching the kit to other items. There are two thick plastic D-rings at the top of the back panel. There are two MOLLE-compatible straps on the back, with snaps on their bottom ends. And there is a longer strap with a plastic buckle, which initially comes wrapped around to the front of the case, but can be deployed to the back of the case to strap it around something instead.",

                "reviewText": "I work in a field of medicine where I deal with acute wounds and injuries often. My overall perspective on this kit would be that they are not the highest quality individual supplies, but incredibly good value. For the average family, this is a fantastic buy. I would add some simple ibuprofen/tylenol and call it a day for most people.To start off, the bag itself is very functional and although the labels seem a bit random as they are not perfectly on the dot for the things packed inside, are nice if you want to reorganize. This thing is packed with many things that would take most people a lot of effort to search and purchase separately and it will definitely cost significantly more than this collection. In terms of quality, they may not be the highest quality, but definitely would work very well as a layperson for almost all injuries for which this is designed for. Likely, most people will probably not use most things in this kit so there is no need for the absolute best. There are also a few random nice items like light sticks and even a hand crank flash light. This flashlight is actually surprisingly good, it looks cheap but its very easy to use, don't need batteries, and actually brightens my room fairly well when it is normally 100% dark (see my photo).",

                "reviewText": "Although it would add some weight to a backpack, this kit does has nice straps to make it easy to take along on long hiking trips. It also has things that are helpful on a day-to-day basis around the house, such as the variety of bandaids, digital thermometer and tweezers attached to a magnifying glass for removing splinters. There is also a little flashlight (powered by squeezing the handle) for power outages.Since items made with rubber and plastic seem to deteriorate more quickly in the trunk of my car during extreme weather, I probably will leave the kit for use in the house, unless I am going on a longer trips, so the rubber gloves and bandaids will get more use. I have a small bathroom and don\u2019t have room for medical supplies there, so this kit will be kept downstairs for us to grab as needed and refilled with additional supplies whenever these are depleted.Random note: I did think the ace bandages seemed smaller than what I would typically buy, and the thermometer seemed a little flimsy.",

                "reviewText": "First aid kits like this can be a wild grab bag of almost useful goods. This is a fairly well thought out kit. The case is brilliant and gives you plenty of options to stowing and transporting the whole kit.I do think that the sheer volume of space dedicated to adhesive bandages might be adjusted to make room for a NAR CAT tourniquet, vented chest seal, and or some hemostatic bandages or powder.The included (empty) pill box would do well to be a little more generous in capacity. Depending on what you choose to carry (e.g., pain relievers, antihistamines, anti-diarrheals, anti-nausea, etc.) there will either be several circumstances for which you have a single dose, or numerous circumstances you aren't ready for at all.)Everyone should always customize your first aid kit for circumstances you're likely to encounter, but I think this kit makes some strange assumptions.",

I got this to keep in my truck cause you never know when a family member or a stranger on the side of the road will need my help. Great for those who go fishing, camping, hunting, trail walking, or just because you have children. This is one of those items you NEED to have in hand because it\u2019s better to have and not need then NEED it and not have it! The case itself is a very nice, durable, like thick book bag material is the best I can explain it.It literally has everything you could need in an emergency to hold you over until you can get help. Al kinds of different band aids, gauze rolls and pads, cleaning wipes for cuts, a flashlight! Glow sticks, a digital thermometer, the mist goes on and on\u202648 different items with a lot of which have multiples of each.I\u2019m really impressed with this and that is in all honesty.",

They use all the available space and it's really well organized and labeled. It's a has pretty much anything you need for any minor injury. It's so handy to have whether at home or to stick in the trunk of your car just in case of an emergency. Knowing I have all the essentials in case someone is unexpectedly hurt is a comfort. I usually carry bandaids but this also has an emergency blanket, cooling packs, ace bandages, flashlight, tweezers -- so many things I hadn't considered before. I would definitely recommend this kit.",
