I purchased a wallet years ago from a large clothing branch and it came in a metal box. I've since enjiyed building my edc kits so i kept that box for years. Now I'm putting together a first aid kit and it was already a red box so i really needed a 1st aid decal and this one fit the bill. It was the percect size. I was going to round the sides off because of my ocd but I can live with the straight corners. Decal feels well made, I'm a large format digital printer tech and the substrate/plastic film is a very well made material. Its a PSA, material meaning it's pressure sensitive adhesive. It's not cheap material i removed it several times before making certain it was perfectly straight. I have no complaints, it worked well for my application and im considering making a few more fisrt aid kits. Would i recommend these yeup, without a doubt. I wasn't provided these decals in turn for my review nor was my item discounted. Hope this helps",
