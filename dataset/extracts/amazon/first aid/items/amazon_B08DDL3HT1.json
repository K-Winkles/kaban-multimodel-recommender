I purchased it to put in my food storage as a first aid kit, in case it is ever needed. It's got everything you'll ever need and more. I am very happy with this first aid kit. It is a bulky one because it comes with so much, but I would prefer knowing I have everything I will ever need than be missing something in my time of need. It would fit well in the back of a car, closet, or storage, but it's not one I would take backpacking because it's so large. I might use it to replenish my backpacking first aid kit though if needed.",

I\u2019m glad I had it with me because one of our runners was extremely dehydrated to the point of heat stroke when he finished his leg of the rest. I used the to ice packs to cool him down by placing them around his neck. He was also given fluids and he recovered after about 30 min.",
