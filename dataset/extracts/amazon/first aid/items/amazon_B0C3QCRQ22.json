We've used it for my family and homestead.My husband is quite active and a general Mr. Fix It, but he's constantly getting knicks here and there to where bandaids won't stay put. For example when we are require the use of nitrile gloves. Use a little of this around the bandaid helps keep them in place.My kids also use this for when they have a spot that needs to stay covered. For example the last time was when my youngest skinned his knee but wanted to roll around on the trampoline.We've used it on my dogs, chickens, ducks, geese, goat, and I imagine we will use it on other animals as we get them.I would buy these again.",
