                "reviewText": "This is nothing more than a lancet, but it works. Both of my kids have cars now, and are heading off to college, so I have been buying first aid kits to put in their cars. They gave me the \"mom-roll-eye\" treatments, but soon after buying the first aid kits (like the next day) they were used by their friends, not once but twice in one day.I saw this, and read the write up and thought \"what the heck\" and ordered it. The very day it came in the mail, I had to pick up a small piece of plywood and lo and behold, I got a HUGE splinter in my hand. Not the little splinter you usually get, but the big plank type. I took one of these things out of the package (they are single use items) and was disappointed when I first saw it. I guess I was hoping for a miracle splinter extractor. It is not that....just a lancet, or metal plank with a metal point on the end. But it is razor sharp. You simple cut the skin on top of the splinter and lift the splinter out. The thing that makes this work is the flatness of the part you hold. A needle is small and round and difficult to hold, and the point is just a point. This is like a tiny knife, and it doesn't roll in your fingers. What would have been an hour or so event to get the splinter out, took just a few minutes once I figured out what I needed to do.So you use it to prick and slice the skin that is on top of the splinter to open up a channel so that the splinter lifts directly up.Very glad I ordered this on a whim. I haven't had a splinter in about 2 years, and the day this comes in the mail is the day I got one.I recommend buying burn gel also while you're at it.",
