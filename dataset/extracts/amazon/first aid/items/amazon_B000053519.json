I have noticed most injuries do happen outside. Maybe it's a cut, scrape, sting from an insect, etc. The kit also has contents that also apply to in-door \"accidents\" as well.However because their are so many items in the kit, it's hard to find the things you need for an emergency that needs to be dealt with as soon as possible. When you open the kit you will see clear pouches containing your medical contents. I suggest you organize everything neatly so it makes things easier to find. In fact, the thin cardboard shell that the kit comes covered with has a good example on how this kit should be organized with this kind of bag.Here is all the items in the kit(I am surprised none of you actually decide to let others know of all the contents...);Medicine Antiseptics;4 Aspirin tablets4 Ibuprofen tablets4 Extra-strength non-aspirin tablets12 BZK antiseptic towelettes12 Alcohol cleaning pads3 Castile soap towelettes3 Insect sting relief pads3 Antibiotic ointment packs1 Sunscreen pack2 Lip ointment packs3 First aid/burn cream packs1 Burn relief gel packBandages;50 Adhesive plastic bandages, 3/4\" x 3\"25 Fabric bandages, 3/4\" x 3\"10 Fabric bandages, 1\" x 3\"10 Junior adhesive plastic bandages, 3/8\" x 1-1/2\"4 Knuckle fabric bandages4 Fingertip fabric bandages2 Elbow & knee plastic bandages, 2\" x 4\"3 Butterfly wound closuresInjury Treatment;1 Instant cold compress4 Moleskin squares, 2\" x 2\"2 First aid tape rolls, 1/2\" x 5yd.1 Finger splint, 6\" x 3/4\"10 Gauze dressing pads, 2\" x 2\"4 Gauze dressing pads, 3\" x 3\"2 Gauze dressing pads, 4\" x 4\"1 Trauma pad, 5\" x 9\"1 Conforming gauze roll bandage, 2\"1 Sterile eye padReferences, Instruments;1 Durable, clear-pocket neon softpack with reflector stripe1 First Aid Guide1 Scissors1 Tweezers, metal2 Safety pins10 Cotton-tipped applicators, 3\"2 Exam quality vinyl gloves",

Upon recieving the package I was excited to add this to my bug out bag, only to find out there were a few missing items while I was doing inventory. It was missing the scissors, the finger splint, and the tweezers. I was pretty angry because even though those items are rather insignificant, I paid for it therefore I should recieve all the items. Anyhow, I called the customer service on the receipt, and was pleased with how helpful they were (even though it took 40 mins to get through it) I do wish though that they had American customer support, because it was hard to understand a single garbled word my rep was saying. (thus the reason it took 40 mins) but I was given a refund (minus the ungodly expensive shipping and handleing) and im happy with the product. I already had to use the cold pack cuz my mom fell and hit her head, so its useful.ProsComes with alot of helpful pieces, gauze, sunburn ointment, sunscreen, itch ointment, the basics, and great customer service.conslooked like they just threw everything in the pouch without thought or care, was missing a few items, and WAY too many bandaids (i think there were over 150 bandaids)50 large standard bandaids50 small standard bandaids10 butterfly bandaids10 knuckle bandaids10 finger bandaids10 junior bandaidsthere are like 3 more sets of 10 bandaids that I dont feel like tearing apart my bug out bag to list, but like I said an excessive amount of bandaids.",

I wanted to get another one like the one I bought from First Aid Only about 10 years ago (Costco?) that has a blue, soft-sided case with little boxes of supplies you can reorder when you run out. It has more supplies and it is very easy to find them. I like that one better, but I can't seem to find one like it. First Aid Only, do you still make that one? Funny, every single item in that kit has a reorder number EXCEPT the full kit itself.",

                "reviewText": "This is exactly the kit I was looking for to keep in my ATV. It contains a generous supply of the basics for injuries and minor wounds that might occur in remote areas. Although it contains two small rolls of medical tape, I've found that a large roll of tape sufficient to wrap sprained ankles, wrists or to bandage a puncture wound always comes in handy. Add that item. This kit is light-weight and fits perfectly into an ATV saddle bag. The flexible nylon container allows for extra items that might be desired - and the bright-orange color keeps it easily visible in the woods if you are working an emergency away from the vehicle, so you will not lose it in the leaves.",
