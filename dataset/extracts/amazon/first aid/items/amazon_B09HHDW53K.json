After finding it destroyed, I went to return it and found that it's not eligible for returns. This was pretty disappointing but for the price I could buy 3 and it would still be cheaper than CVS or Walgreens prices, so I gave it another shot. The second one did arrive in perfect condition.I think its still worth buying but just note that peroxide is a bleaching agent, if broken like mine with a saturated box left in the sun on your porch could damage or discolor wood, porous stone, laminate, or linoleum flooring. Luckily my package was left on our rubber walk in mat so my porch was not damaged.",
