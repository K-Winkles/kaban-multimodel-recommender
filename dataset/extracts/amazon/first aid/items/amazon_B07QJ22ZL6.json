I've had generic brands before, they don't work as well for me as the brand name. I burned my arm taking brownies out of the oven. I've burned my arm on the oven before, so didn't think much of it. One day my armed turned beet red and was throbbing a got pretty gross looking. It burned and throbbed. I knew it was infected. 1st thing, i grabbed the neosporin i really covered the area with it and took 2 tylenol. It was so painful. The next morning it looked a tad better and went to the urgent care right below me. The doctor came in and said * how did you do that* i told him. He said how were the brownies. I said amazing. Good thing i went in, he asked if i put anything on it. Bactine 1st then name brand neosporin. He said it was good i put neosporin on it, it could've been worse by morning. I ended up on antibiotics and still put neosporin on the gross area for next 2 days, then the antibiotics kicked in. I will never be without neosporin, not matter what it costs. I never know when I'll need it.I still have scar. I sure am more careful with the oven.",
