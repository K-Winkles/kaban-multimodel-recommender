                "reviewText": "Ok so I needed a cheap kit to build on for long term travel (primarily on foot but also possibly bicycle and train, sometimes in the city, sometimes in wilderness) and this one had the lowest price/highest rating/greatest number of items.The case itself is a soft but sturdy zip up, somewhat translucent so you can see whatever is in the back pockets. I expect it is water resistant, if left in moderate rain the contents probably wouldn't get soaked, but if it fell out of your boat water would be able to get in around the fabic of the zipper. It is bigger than a dvd case but smaller than a composition book, but thicker than both put together.It claims 299 pieces so here are the contents, or at least what I got in mine:- 50 tiny bandaids, like doll sized. Maybe 1/4 an inch wide and less than 1 1/2 inches long. Good for toddler sized wounds, minor pinpricks, paper cuts you can't actually see but can feel, and pinky fingers. However they could possibly act as butterfly stitches (which are included in the kit but you only get a few) if needed, with the gauze patch of the bandage going directly over the cut and the adhesive parts holding the skin together.- 4 fingertip bandaids- 1 single use pack of burn gel- 3 2-packs (6 tablets in all) of 200mg ibuprofen- 3 2-packs of non-aspirin 500mg- 3 2-packs of aspirin 325mg- 1 square bandaid. Yeah, just one. *shrug*- 3 small gauze pads- 2 large gauze pads- 1 large rectangle bandaid. Again, just one.- 1 sterile eye pad- 3 butterfly stitches- 4 knuckle bandaids- 1 trauma pad- 1 xl gauze pad- 135 regular sized bandaids. There were technically 2 sizes, but they did not differ by more than 1/4 of an inch, and they would both be adequate for a minor scrape or cut. Some were labeled fabric, others I'm assuming are either latex or plastic, but the packaging did not specifically say. 135 seems like overkill, especially when they skimped on other sizes and shapes, but if this was to be a home or office kit ordinary bandaids are probably what people would need the most.- 2 sting relief pads- 14 alcohol cleansing pads- 6 single use packs of neomycin cream- 2 single use packs of first aid cream- 1 mylar blanket- 1 pair of nitrile gloves, size large- 1 gauze roll- 3 pre-cut moleskin pads, each about 1 square inch- a small pair of trauma shears, obviously cheap but sturdy enough for an emergency.- several (I'm sorry I didn't count but I'm pretty sure it was less than ten) cotton tipped swabs, presumably for application of ointment. I really don't know why else you would need them.- plastic tweezers which would work in a pinch, but are probably worth about 3 pennies in all.- 1 single use thermometer- 15 bzk towelettes. I don't really know why they went with these instead of more alcohol pads, as benzalkonium chloride can be irritating if it gets inside the body, but as long as you don't jam these up your nose you should be fine.- 2 popsicle sticks. Whoever put the kit together probably referred to them as tongue depressors or budget toe splints (which I guess they could be if you cut them up), but yeah, they're extra large popsicle sticks.- 2 small, as in 1/4 inch wide, rolls of medical tape- 1 instant cold pack- 1 emergency guide made of magazine type paperOverall the contents seem to be well-made, and most minor incidents that you would encounter at home are covered to a degree. This kit will definitely need some supplements, but it is a nice start.There was one whole pocket free on the left size of my kit and more space could be created for additional supplies with some tweaking of the current contents.Some suggestions for a better kit: Toss out the \"emergency guide\" (if you're buying this kit, you hopefully know basic first aid), it takes up space and won't last long outside of the case. Remove at least half the bandaids (stick them in your glove compartment, your desk at work, your purse, your wallet or your pocket) and add more medications (there was nothing included for gastrointestinal issues, allergies, or cold relief and everybody can always use more pain relievers), more gloves, another roll of tape, another roll of gauze, a few more large (like kneecap road rash size) bandaids and some of the other various shapes depending on personal preference, a tube of general first aid cream, and more burn and sting care items if you mean to travel with it. Dump the tongue depressors unless you're really attached to them, and the same goes for the q-tips.If you wanted a more serious kit, you would probably want a cheap triangle bandage, a SAM splint (which will not fit in the kit but would be good to have), an ace bandage, and some Quickclot.And...yeah ok that's about it. *shrug*",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the First Aid Only 442 All-Purpose Emergency First Aid Kit for Home, Work, and Travel, 298 Pieces. It's a very thorough first aid kit, plus it includes a thermal emergency blanket, which I haven't seen in many other small first aid kits. I like that it includes three burn packs and instant cold compress. It has every size Bandaid that you can imagine. There's enough room in the bag to add other items. Excellent for home, car, and bike. Highly recommended.",

Twice I have been the second on scene when the first on scene was a paramedic or EMT. Both times they asked for a first aid kit and glad to see the gloves. Both times I handed them the kit and exited, leaving them the kit and the patient in good hands (don't worry, I didn't leave until they had additional help). For a person with ZERO medical skills, it was money well spent to help strangers.",

This one comes with a few things I thought would be needed in an emergency. The list on of contents lets you know if what you need is part of the kit. If you use something, be sure to replace it. The Red Cross first aid guide is very useful and clear for you to find the situation you are dealing with. One of the big things I like in the kit is the instant cold pack. The sooner you get cold on a sprain the better. Aspirin, non-aspirin pain tablets, thermometer and burn gel are a couple of other things that made this kit stand out for me.",
