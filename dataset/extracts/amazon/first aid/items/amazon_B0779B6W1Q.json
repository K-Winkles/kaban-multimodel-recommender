This Amazon product is very inexpensive, and is just what is needed for most burns. I worked on a hospital burn ward, so I appreciate having this ready to go, just in case. I could say I may never need it, but most likely I will. I hope you have a decent first aid kit that YOU put together, not something that comes with what someone thinks you may need. Stock it yourself, and be sure to add a tube of this ointment. When you suffer a burn, that's not the time you want to drive to a drugstore...and before going to an urgent care clinic or ER, you may be able to avoid those options by treating your burn yourself.",
