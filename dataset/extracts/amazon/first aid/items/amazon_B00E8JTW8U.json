                "reviewText": "I bought these gauze packs for my first aid kit that I have built in my car. I am a healthcare professional and so having a good first aid kit is very important. I like these because they are individually wrapped which is really good for packing them in a backpack or putting them in a first aid kit in one's car. The one thing I wasn't entirely positive about was if these gauze packs are sterile or considered clean. In a disaster or crisis it's not going to stop me from using them, but I would prefer to know that they are sterile because I don't want to do something that is going to place the patient at a greater risk for infection.The other thing that I liked about the way these were packaged is that they came in a small box that holds them very easily. I haven't unwrapped any of these yet, but based upon the size of the wrap I believe these are fairly short sections of gauze, which is just fine because you can double them up if need be.Overall I am very pleased with these gauze wraps and I think that they are going to work really well for what I want to use them for.",

                "reviewText": "I specifically purchased this product because my hands constantly tear and bleed, requiring regular bandaging to prevent staining just about everything I touch. I was so tired of buying gauze rolls that were either too wide or too long. I am not a fan of keeping a partial roll of gauze waiting for my next bandage session. So I was wasting money throwing partial rolls away. I found these to be perfect for wrapping around my hands and thumbs. The gauze isn't so thick that I can't manage the wrap. The length is perfect. I use an entire roll at a time and don't have a huge bulky bandage that prevents me from being able to do my daily tasks. Of course, it isn't the right wrap to manage a major bleed; most gauze wraps don't by themselves. But if you want something that isn't bulky and will manage a normal bleeding situation, then I would recommend this product. I know I'm ordering again today. The reviews seem to run the gambut from love it or hate it. Guess that puts me on the Love It side.",

I also love that they are individually wrapped, hard to open if you have already used his lotions & creams but worth it bc then I know its sanitary. & its soft so he likes it & doesn't complain about using them after a major flare. hes only 45lbs so he can use one for both wrists &forearms (we cut them in half) & we buy the longer ones for his ankle/leg wraps. we buy them monthly now for about 5months & could only be better if on subscribe & save!",

I probably wouldn't buy this expecting to use it in a wound clinic, since the width is rather small and you'd have to use a lot of it, but it would be great for personal use or for restocking first aid kits in businesses, schools, etc. I bought it to send in my Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes, which go to countries all over the developing world where medical supplies may be scarce, and they are exactly what I was hoping for.

Most of them have skin too thin for island dressing, so I am always much more comfortable to use a non adhesive dressing and keeping in place with these gauze. It is soft and thin making it really comfortable. I use paper tape to keep it and it will stay on for several days if left alone, although I wouldn't have a bandage not changed for that long, it happened that people never returned to get it changes until 5 days later. It will \"fuzz up\" but like I said. Not meant to keep on that long. If you are looking for something that will be absorbent or will provide some type of immobilization this is not the correct product.",

These rolls of gauze(?) work fine for my needs and are exactly as described. I see a lot of reviews complaining of the size, can't people read? The information is obvious, don't complain because YOU didn't do your homework. I'm ordering more today. Update 5-3-17, received my second order of bandages, same product but came with no boxes, the rolls were individually wrapped as before but came in Ziploc bags! Not boxed! I found this odd, if you're going to cut corners how about cutting the price? Unbelievable.",

I bought for my cousin to use when she goes with a group that go to Philly, Pa to take care of homeless! It looked cheap & not sterile! Unhappy cause not delivered as stated!!!!!!",
