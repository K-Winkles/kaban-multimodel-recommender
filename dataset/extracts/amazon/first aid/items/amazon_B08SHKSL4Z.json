                "reviewText": "The bandages work great at protecting wounds. However, come off easily when wet. It took some time for the makeup and hosiery industries to understand the benefits of having more diversity in their products. I would need an industry leader such as Band-Aid to offer more than three tones! Right to left: regular Band-Aid, next BR45, then BR 55. I barely note a difference between the first two shades. Unfortunately, I no longer have their deepest shade on hand, (BR 65, I believe) but imagine semisweet dark chocolate. C'mon! To the manufacturer: If younger brands, i.e., Fenty, Sheertex, etc, can deliver a range of tones, why can't a brand that has become synonymous with the product? Only kids like obvious bandages, adults, not so much! And if you're worried about your bottom line, sell in Ulta or Sephora and watch the market respond.",
