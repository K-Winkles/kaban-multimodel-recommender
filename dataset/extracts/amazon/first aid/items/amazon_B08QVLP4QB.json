                "reviewText": "Despite what the description says, this is not a kit for \"survival situations\" or your for car, camping, travel, sports & home. The point of a first aid kit is to treat minor injuries or to stabilize a person until medical assistance can be provided.A first aid kit for survival or injuries sustained while hiking, playing sports or around the house wouldn't fit into such a tiny package. If you need a first aid kit for those situations, go with something much bigger and better equipped. Even for hiking, this is just too small to be effective.HOWEVER, this is the perfect kit for common day-to-day injuries. Just a tad bit larger than two stacked decks of playing cards, it's a nice little pouch that fits easily inside a purse or backpack without taking up much room. I'll be honest that I mostly buy ready-made first aid kits for the bag they come in, and then customize them. If they come with useful items, it's just an added bonus.This pouch is a semi-rigid fabric shell, to keep things from crushing, has decent, easy-open zippers, pockets for organizing, and the bright red color stands out. (Always have your first-aid kit in a color that stands out. You don't want to be scrambling and searching in an emergency. Whoever thought of \"tactical colored\" first aid kits outside of military usage should be shot. And then have to find their first aid kit in the woods in the dark to treat themselves.)The items in the kit itself are not special, but they're not bad quality either. I immediately ditched the scissors (too small to function), dot bandaids (useless), alcohol pads (only good for injection sites, not cleaning cuts), and safety manual to free up space. I kept the bandaids in useful sizes, antiseptic wipes, tape and tweezers. I cut the number of burn-cream, cotton buds and safety pins down to two each and kept the rest for restocking later.I also added two each of sting wipes, antibiotic ointment & hydrocortisone packets, eye-drops, and 2x3 gauze. I also added a single pair of gloves and a triangular bandage for any bigger emergencies. (Google the uses for a triangular bandage. They're a great, versatile emergency item you should have in any first aid kit and know how to use.)So with modifications, this tiny little kit can treat; cuts, scrapes, burns, splinters, stings, bites, minor rashes and anything a triangular bandage can manage. Not bad for such a tiny kit.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very good minor first aid kit.This size is great as well as the price. I've already purchased two of these (one for myself and one for my mother).The only thing I would suggest is that if they were to upgrade this kit they might think about adding 2 or 3 2\"x2\" gauze pads (I've added 3 to my pack, and it doesn't effect the size too much; it does make it a bit fatter, but not by much). I found it kind of funny that they include medical tape but no gauze pads.Any how, this is a great kit. I highly recommend this. It fits great in your backpack, or you can clip it onto your zipper for easy access (i believe it comes with a carabiner as both purchases had one attached).Also, it came packaged in a resealable plastic bag, which could be useful in and of itself.If you're looking for a good and reasonably priced travel sized first aid kit, this is a great option.",
