                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Stopped the bleeding! Effectively.",
                "reviewText": "Honestly would've gone to the ER without a doubt.... without the effective use of Bleedstop. I bled from 7 am on a Saturday all the way to 11 am on a Sunday because I cut my leg with a razor and skinned off the top layer of my skin. It was a very large gash extending from my knee down to almost my ankle... no idea a single swipe of a razor blade could do that.My first approach was to immediately clean the wound and disinfect it on spot. It hurt a lot because blood kept running, so I wrapped a tight towel around it best I could, taped it up (with regular tape), and ran to the nearest CVS store to get Gauze, Wrap, and Medical Tape. I refused to go to an ER at the time because the wound was so shallow of a cut that I don't know what the medical professionals would've done differently. But I am sure they would've done something.Even with consistent pressure applied, I bled through the bandages within a few hours. Made me panic and I knew I needed something else to stop the bleeding. I changed them consistently everytime they bled through.Later in the afternoon, I researched and got BleedStop. Applied the first packet of Bleedstop in the afternoon and followed directions, which stopped the bleeding for a bit. (Thank God)However, when I slept overnight, I bled through the bandages. The warnings on the packet did say to go to the ER if the bleeding didn't stop. I wasn't in a position to have more emergency bills on my hands...given the fact I just went that same week for an infected mosquito bite. And my insurance doesn't kick in until 4 days later (bad timing, right?). So! I took the risk and applied a second packet the next day after cleaning the wound off. (Please do not do this, I knowingly took the risk and it was incredibly stressful awaiting the verdict, hoping I had done the right thing.)It hurt a ton. I held the powder there for 15 minutes firmly, applying the entire packet, before bandaging everything up again. The bleeding miraculously stopped after the second packet!The following day, I examined the wound, and it looked like areas where the powder had aggregated created an effective barrier. So I cleaned up the edges and didn't bother picking off the scabs because I was afraid in doing so would cause me to bleed again. Applied a thin layer of Neosporin after cleaning up the wound best I could without disturbing the scabs, and applied bandages. I had to combine two pads because of how long the gash was and made sure the sticky side didn't touch any part of the wound.I bled just a tiny bit over the next few days, but nothing as significant as what I bled during the weekend.As the days progressed on, I was able to clean more of the powder off without disturbing the overall wound, and eventually all of the powder off. The wound started off looking incredibly dark red, but no signs of noticeable infection occurred so I kept up the regime of removing the bandages, cleaning with soap, cleaning with sterile gauze, applying Neosporin + Aquaphor, then reapplying the bandages. Week and a half into this now, and the skin is looking a ton better and healing up with a scar.This was a painful lesson to be had, but I am so grateful for BleedStop! I bought extra just in case...but hope to never use it again. It's always good to have this on hand in case the unexpected happens, though.",

                "reviewText": "I didn't know a product like this even existed until I shaved off part of my thumb using a mandolin while preparing food for Christmas. I could not stop the bleeding, which continued for over 30 hours. I called an Urgent Care facility, but they were booked so my only other option was to go to an Emergency Room if the bleeding didn't stop, and it was Christmas Eve. Fortunately, the bleeding finally did stop but I since learned about this product and bought a box for myself and my sister (who is on blood thinners). We both keep it in a kitchen cabinet where cuts are more likely to happen. I don't ever want to go through that again. I believe if I had gone to the hospital, this is the same or similar product to what they probably would've used. It's better to be prepared!",
