A unique aspect is its sensitivity to temperature. When it arrived during the warmer months, the contents were somewhat fluid. However, allowing it to settle at room temperature or placing it in the refrigerator briefly helps it regain the right consistency. This characteristic doesn't detract from the product's quality; it's just a factor to consider during delivery and storage.The tube is compact and convenient, similar in size to everyday personal care items, making it easy to handle and use. Despite its petite appearance, the product is quite effective. Sharing such nuances in reviews is important to provide a comprehensive understanding of the product's performance and characteristics.",
