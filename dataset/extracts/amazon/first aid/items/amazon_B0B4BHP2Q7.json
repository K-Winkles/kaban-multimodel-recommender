Yes! Each patch contains powerful X-static silver fibers that are suspended in the gel. We add this to each patch because of silver's antimicrobial properties. Are these patches sterile? Yes, each patch is sterile Will SilverSeal stick to my wounded skin? No, Silverseal will not stick to skin. You will need to secure each patch with a conventional bandage of your choosing to keep a secure hold. No adhesive means that your wound will heal without the fear of pulling new skin. (Ouch!). Is SilverSeal medical-grade? Yes, SilverSeal has been used in the hospital setting for over 20+ years and now Medagel is bringing this technology directly to you!",

Amazing product! The only downfall is it kinda starts to put off this annoying smell the longer you have it on, in a matter of a day but you\u2019re changing it by then so it\u2019s not too bad. Other than that, very impressed!",
