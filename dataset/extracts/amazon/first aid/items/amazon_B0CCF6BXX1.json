                "reviewText": "I'm a first aid freak. I have two boys and a clumsy husband and keep kits everywhere. The house, the garage, each car, etc. I've spent a lot of time researching kits and I've never come across one that was perfect, so I've gone into this one with modest expectations. Like all kits, this will come with things you likely won't ever need or use in the quantity they give you- do you really need 4 dozen cotton swabs? Probably not. Still, it covers most of the basics with a decent case. You'll get the gauzes and bandages, and an ice pack (be sure to replace it if you use it) and some other safety gear like a whistle and blanket. I think that makes this a decent kit for a car. Its packable in a backpack if you're hiking, though for day hikes I'd probably go a little smaller. The dates on everything that had them were very good- about 5 years out from date of receipt.The kit case itself is maybe a 6 out of 10 for me- its hard sided, red, and has pockets, but they don't close! I'll probably add some velcro or something, because everything keeps sliding out. I know you want easy access, so you probably don't want a zipper, but if this kit wasn't so stuffed, the things would just fall out.",

                "reviewText": "If you need a basic first aid kit for every day minor injuries you can't go wrong with this one. I consider this a minor first aid kit, meaning it has everything needed to address common and minor injuries such as bumps, bruises, cuts, scrapes, etc. This is a great kit to keep in the car, the workshop, in the house, or to take camping.The case itself is great! It's made of a rigid waterproof material with a nice reinforced carry handle, double zippers that function smoothly, and an included shoulder strap. None of the three interior sections have zippers nor is the edge binding elastic. There are some tiny items\u2014safety pins, a whistle, and a compass, for example\u2014that could easily fall out and get lost so I'd suggest putting these types of items in a zip top plastic bag to keep track of them.There are LOTS of bandages, which is good, because that's probably what you'll use most often for minor injuries. The moleskin isn't like the name brand moleskin. It's thin, precut, and started peeling off the backing when I was putting it back in the case. Again, I'd suggest putting this in a plastic bag to keep it intact.The expiration date on items ranged from 2025 for the iodine prep pads to 2028 for the alcohol-free cleansing wipes.It was packed sort of randomly so I reorganized it in a way that makes more sense to me. You may also want to supplement this kit with more adhesive tape and things like ibuprofen. I will probably remove some things I know I won't use to make room for other items that I use more frequently and that are tailored to my specific needs.Bottom line is that this kit is good for common injuries and is a great alternative to not having one at all!",

I used small zip loc bags to organize and label1) various sizes of gauze pads2) various sizes of non adherent pads3) large size adhesive bandages and special-shape ones like butterflies. I added a few large size ones.There is enough space to add some supplementary items: I chose small pillboxes of extra strength acetaminophen and ibuprofen, a small container of saline solution.It seems durable but I may store it in a dry bag for extra peace of mind. I don\u2019t care about the weight, it will be used for front-country camping.",
