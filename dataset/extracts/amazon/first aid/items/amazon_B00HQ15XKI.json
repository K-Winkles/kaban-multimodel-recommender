The kit is not as extensive as what a professional medical person would use, but it has everything the layperson would need. I bought this kit to store at my lake house getaway home because medical help is usually quite a distance away. It's well equipped, adequate for most emergencies, and the price point fits most budgets. I added a few things that I preferred, but overall I'm quite satisfied with this kit.",

                "reviewText": "Really really stellar for the price, with alot of room to expand. Includes some pretty pricey items. however, note:-Only comes with one clotting bandage for severe trauma. buy extras and stuff em in the kit.-Reorganize this puppy as soon as you get it, it all just kinda comes all dumped in there, you can make way more effecient use of the space, and make it easier to find stuff.-Stethoscope/Blood pressure cuff a little tricky to use. I would practice this, as it requires you to pick up your pulse on your brachial artery with the stethoscope. I might replace this with a digital unti and keep the stethoscope for diagnostics.-Penlight doesn't seem to work at all, and in fact, I cannot open it to replace batteries. replace this. (I just stuck a cheap LED flashlight from radioshack in here to augment this)- If this thing is stuffed/ filled out, the top won't close exactly securely. leaves a little room on each side for stuff to plop out. Not a big deal to me, I keep it in the trunk of my car so that\u2019s fine. if you are carrying/walking/running though, could cause grief.-Does not seem to come with a pair(s) of surgical gloves. this is a pretty big health risk, I would add these, but im not too worried over it as these are inexpensive.Overall, great place to start, but by no means does it match to the plethora of items you may have if you had an EMT bag.",
