The problem is that the smaller kits tend to be incomplete and unattractively priced (IMHO).So, I'm assembling a set of custom first aid kits to scatter around my life (in the cars, in the garage/workshop, at the office, at the camp, etc). I am using empty PTFE food-supplement jars to hold the items I deem necessary in an emergency first-aid kit (including this product). The benefits are numerous: these containers are perfectly sized to both contain the kit and to stash almost anywhere, the jars are waterproof, airtight, and durable, AND (because they are custom-built by me) they contain everything I feel I'm likely to need.",

The expiration date was a couple years out, and that is always my main concern when ordering stuff like this. Good value for me, definitely cheaper to buy the perishable things you need to replace than it is to buy a whole new kit.",
