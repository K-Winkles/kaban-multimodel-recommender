                "reviewText": "This review is for 24 count \"Toe Pack\" of Dr. Frederick's Original Better Blister Bandages.I found these hydrocolloid bandages to pretty soothing and protective, much like others I've used before.If you're not familiar, hydrocolloid dressings work by creating a moist environment that promotes faster healing. Their gel-like material adheres to the blister, providing a protective barrier against friction and reducing pain. Simultaneously, this gel absorbs excess fluid from the blister to support the healing process. The patches turn white in the spots that they're absorbing fluid, and this is how you can tell they're working.If you're familiar with how hydrocolloid bandages work, these do the job pretty much like any other.However, one drawback is that they didn't seem to stick as well as some other hydrocolloid bandages I've used. I found myself having to restick them once or twice. It didn't ruin the experience, but it was a bit annoying, and it made me a bit concerned about whether the skin under the bandage would remain sterile.Now, about the cost. Let's be real\u2014hydrocolloid bandages, in general, can be a bit pricey. Dr. Frederick's is no exception. While they might seem expensive, it's kind of the nature of these types of bandages.Overall, they're pretty solid blister bandages, but the sticking power could be better.",
