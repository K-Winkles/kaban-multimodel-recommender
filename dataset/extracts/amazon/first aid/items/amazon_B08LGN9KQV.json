I won't go into all the items included as they list it on the description and that is accurate, but suffice to say this is more comprehensive than what I was looking for. That's a great surprise to be honest. I now have a nice compact kit that covers a very large range of eventualities. The case is also very nice and seems like it will hold well. I can toss it into my hiking pack or just include it with camping gear. I may order another just for the car.",
