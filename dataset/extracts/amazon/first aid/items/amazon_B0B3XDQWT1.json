                "reviewText": "I\u2019m so pleased with how well everything I wanted to put in it actually fit!I wanted to make a first-aid kit for my 14-month old granddaughter, who has had a couple very scary experiences with febrile seizures (caused by sudden fever), so her mom and dad need to carry the seizure medication at all times. All the \u2018pre-loaded\u2019 first-aid kits are *very heavy* on bandaids, and do not really have enough other critical first-aid items that a child who has febrile seizures, or is first learning to walk/run might need for a bad skin gash, head bump, or sprained ankle at the playground or park.Here\u2019s what I was able to pack *comfortably* in this little bag (the prescription seizure meds are not shown, but are small and will easily fit): three 4\u201dx5\u201d instant-cold packs, 4.5-oz can of burn spray (also good for insect bites/stings and sunburn), 2.3-oz foaming antiseptic cleanser, full-size Ace wrap (could also be used as a tourniquet if needed), small bottle of 24 children\u2019s chewable ibuprofen, three full-size packages of bleed-stop powder, six packages 3\u201dx3\u201d antibacterial gauze pads, one full-size tube Neosporin ointment, eight packages antiseptic hand wipes, 1 packet containing two fever-reducer patches, and nice little stacks of waterproof bandaids in three sizes.Although I did not put scissors, gauze tape or tweezers, those items would also fit. At first I thought a more rigid-sided case would be better, but those were either too big or too small, and this is soft enough to conform to fit under a car seat, in the baby\u2019s diaper bag, or in the sling under the stroller seat. For the price, this bag is just fine - it\u2019s what\u2019s in it that counts! I hope this helps you create the perfect first-aid kit for the kids in your life, too. :)",

It's pretty cheap feeling and I question the long term durability of the zipper. However, how often do we really get into a car first aid kit? So it'll probably serve it's pupose, but I don't love it.Pros: Small enough to fit in my glove compartment without taking up all the space. See through, flip, zipper pockets (like a small, thick ziplock attached at the middle of the case) . Mesh pocket on one side. Straps to hold smaller items such as pen lights above mesh pocket.Cons: Mesh pocket needs to be deeper. Straps should be on other side where there's nothing or add more pockets. Awkward best.",
