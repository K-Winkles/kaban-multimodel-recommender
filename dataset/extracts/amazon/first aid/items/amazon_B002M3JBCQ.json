                "reviewText": "I've been purchasing medical products on here for my family First Aid Kits, and have noticed a wide disparity between really good, reliable products and those products that seem to carry comments from people upset that the product they received was not the image depicted or was (in the realm of medical products like bandages) made in a particular country or arrived less-than-sterile.So, in that spirit I'm offering my observation on these. The product was exactly as depicted in the picture, and arrived sealed in plastic (like as in a package of chewing gum, with cellophane and a red rip line around it). That right away was a big plus for me. Country of origin is not indicated on the external packaging (I haven't cracked it open yet) but the enclosing box contains drug facts on the back--it has to as the wipes are medicated. But that also indicated to me that this was something specifically intended for sale here in the U.S. and therefore reliably meeting U.S. safety requirements. So four stars and job well done.UPDATE: I've opened the package (to assign to different kits) and the individually wrapped towelettes are made in the U.S.A.",
