Once adequately tightened, bleeding will cease and the windlass is locked into place. A hook and loop windlass retention strap is then applied, securing the windlass to maintain pressure during casualty evacuation.Please refer to the user instructions in the packaging for more details.",

Having a tourniquet on hand was suggested on a youtube video and looking into it found these to be inexpensive and seemingly adequate so this purchase was a no brainer.
