                "reviewText": "I have a very simple skin care routine - as recommended by my dermatologist. It\u2019s usually just cerave face wash and moisturizer. I used to have a fancier routine but a lot of products just irritated my face or just didn\u2019t do anything special. I added this Active Skin Repair after Charles Gross talked about it on his tik tok. I don\u2019t usually listen to influencers but his skin is so nice! I use Active Skin repair sometimes daily and sometimes only a couple times a week. It has never made my eczema flare up or caused irritation. I have a really smooth and soft face!The reason I am giving 5 stars is from when I got to witness the true magic of this product on my husband. He sometimes anxiously scratches his face to the point of having these bright red patches on his pale skin. Mid day, I convinced him to use my face wash, the Active Skin Repair, and my moisturizer and by the end of the day, the red patches were nearly gone. There was just a hint of pink. I was shocked to see how much it went down and so quickly too! I figured he\u2019d need a regiment to get improvement. He seriously just used it once and the patches have just stayed gone. I wish I took a before and after but I didn\u2019t expect it to work so quickly!This stuff is better than any fancy toner or oil or gel I\u2019ve ever bought for my face. Now I put it on everything lol. There\u2019s no like super pretty smell but honestly I don\u2019t even think extra fragrance is good for the skin. I\u2019m a huge fan of Active Skin Repair and it\u2019s a staple in my skin care. I\u2019m hesitant to write this because I don\u2019t want to increase demand!",

Sometimes it even gets rid of them overnight. Just spray it on your face in the morning and at night and it works so good!",

It can get quite painful and is not ideal to have antibiotic cream on them are always wear band aids.With Active Skin Repair, I spray my fingers and cuticles a couple of times a day and by the time I am moving on to my next task, it is dry and soaked in. This helped heal up the cracking in record time and now keeps it from even starting. I will always keep this on hand for cuts and gashes. I have no doubt that a product like this would have helped my kids immensely when they were younger.",
