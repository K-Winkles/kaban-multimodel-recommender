                "reviewText": "The KYODOLED Locking Key Medicine Box has earned a solid four-star rating from me due to its sturdy construction and practical design, with a few minor caveats. It serves its primary function well, providing secure storage for medicines and other items. However, it also highlights the importance of comprehensive safety measures, as it may not offer the highest level of security against determined intrusions.The build quality of the KYODOLED Medicine Box is impressive. Constructed with a resilient metal, the box feels sturdy and is designed to withstand daily wear and tear. It opens and closes smoothly, with the hinge mechanism operating without any noticeable issues. The overall dimensions (12.2'' x 7.8'' x 8.2'') are ample enough to accommodate a variety of items, making it suitable for both home and professional use. Its white color gives it a clean, professional look that can blend well with any decor.The locking mechanism is effective for deterring casual snooping, especially from young children or those who might accidentally stumble upon it. This feature adds a level of safety to your home, reducing the risk of accidental ingestions or misuse. However, it's important to note that the lock is not impenetrable. Anyone with the intent and a little bit of knowledge could potentially break into it. Therefore, while it provides a layer of protection, it should not be considered a standalone solution. It would be best to use this box as part of a broader suite of safety precautions, particularly if storing highly sensitive or dangerous items.The inclusion of a tray inside the box is a thoughtful addition that enhances organization and accessibility. This is particularly useful for sorting smaller items or frequently used medicines. However, for those who primarily store larger bottles, the tray can be easily removed to accommodate the extra height, demonstrating the flexibility of this box's design.In conclusion, the KYODOLED Locking Key Medicine Box is a commendable product that blends functionality, flexibility, and a robust build. It provides a valuable solution for secure medication storage, though it should be used as part of a broader safety strategy. Despite its minor limitations, it's an excellent choice for those in need of a reliable, organized medication storage solution. Four out of five stars is a fair reflection of its overall performance.",

Hmm, it worked somewhat but ours still had a small diagonal dent on one of the corners. It locks well and opens easily...and is able to hold approximately 8 bubble packs of pills (9\" L x 6.5\" W x up to 1\" D per pill pack). There is a tray that lays on the top but it's removeable, so that helps. Overall, it's an ok box, not a heavy duty unbreakable beast! Good for keeping meds out of the hands of kids or anyone who gets their meds mixed up and needs help.",
