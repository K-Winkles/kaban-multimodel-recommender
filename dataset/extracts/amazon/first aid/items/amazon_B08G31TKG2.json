                "reviewText": "I've not opened one of these up yet to see if the adhesion, water-resistance, etc. measure up, but Curad is usually a respectable enough bandage brand, making these things for as long as I can remember (and I'm in my 50s), so I'm willing to give them benefit of doubt.For the price, these packets seem like fair enough travel \"boo-boo\" kits: not really serious first-aid kits, but packages of band-aids/plasters and other light-duty items necessary for handling little bumps, bruises, scrapes, paper-cuts, and stings, generally aimed toward travel, purse-and-pocket, and other light-duty use: no replacement for a proper first-aid kit, but the perfect thing for those little every-day \"boo-boos\" that happen to us all, especially outdoors or on all but the more hazardous jobs.This sort of thing at its best would include, in addition to the small bandages, little single-use packets of things like disinfectant, antibiotic ointment, sun screen, burn cream, and even simple OTC meds like aspirin or Immodium or Benedryl, but these packs each only seem to contain an alcohol prep pad and five bandages of assorted sizes and shapes with no duplicates, which isn't bad, but doesn't earn it much more than an average score for the price.At this size, each packet can be thought of as a single-use sort of thing: once someone complains about a little bump, scrape, cut, or whatever, hand over the packet, insist they keep it, and replace it. What would be left over wouldn't be worth trying to recover for later use. This box included about about a dozen of these packets (I wasn't counting), in sealed zip-seal packets to keep them reasonably sterile while traveling in backpacks, purses, glove compartments, emergency kits, tackle boxes, gym bags, and the like: more than enough to distribute into various kits and bags and backpacks around the home, garage, car, work laptop bag, and office desk, with a couple left over to give away to accident-prone friends, coworkers, and/or family members. You might want to ask about the alcohol prep pad in a world of draconian school zero-tolerance rules, but back when I was a kid in the '70s and '80s, one of these packs would have been perfectly suitable to pack into kids' book-bags for school against ordinary playground scrapes and bruises.Had the packets contained duplicates of popular bandage sizes and a few extra common meds like aspirin or antibiotic ointments etc., or had the price been lower, I would have rated this higher, but for the price and what you get, it's a nice enough set of give-away single-use bandage packs for everyday family \"boo-boo\" type light injuries. 3/5, bordering on 4/5.",
