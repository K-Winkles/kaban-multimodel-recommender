                "reviewText": "My shipment was damaged also. There is just not enough packaging around the cabinet for shipping. The problem report process said no refunds. Not the products fault. So other than that, this seems like a great product. Not large quantities for what you pay, but a good value in this product is the Smartcompliance system. Most of the items boxes fit snuggly into a plastic frame which prevents users from taking things out and not putting them back where they should be. The take one boxes have a reorder card in it to prompt you to reorder. Together this will hopefully lead to a well organized and well stocked cabinet for years to come instead of a ransacked mostly empty and cluttered cabinet six months from now. The cabinet is good size and will allow for the stocking of a few other items such as meds, etc.",
