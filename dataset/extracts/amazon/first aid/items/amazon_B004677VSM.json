One of my best childhood memories is of the \u201cstuck on Band Aid\u201d commercial. So when I went to purchase this to put in 48 care bags that I am putting together for a local homeless shelter, I like others here thought that I was getting 48 pks each containing 12 items. It is very misleading that the description would take an individually packaged product and combine the content amount of 4 individually package products to get to the total of 48. In regards to cost, I thought maybe there was a surplus of this and it was being discontinued and that\u2019s why the cost was so low. Very disappointing Band Aid.",

We ordered by mobile app and it said nothing about this being a 4 pack with 12 items in each which equals the 48 (for which we thought were 48 kits with 12 items in each.) It even said 52 cents per item. Who pays 52 cents for one bandaid? And who wants to pay over $6 for this crummy little kit? Definitely returning immediately and we'll have to find another source to help the homeless.Edit: And now we are told we are unable to return these. Over $6 for each kit.",
