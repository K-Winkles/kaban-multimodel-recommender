I have a few such First Aid kits and with all of them - this one included - I do supplement (e.g. chest wound seals, snake-bite kit I'm in CO)...no IFAK can have everything. Still, some others I've bought are more \"first aid/survival\" and contain things like glow sticks but this is more pure IFAK. Also other kits try and give you a bunch of stuff that at the end of the day is cheap - like little gas station knives. This doesn't have that stuff, just core first-aid products and good ones like the splint and the tourniquet. I can supply my own knife!",
