                "reviewText": "I purchased this for a family member who recently started driving. It's a good little kit to keep in the car, and I like that it included a multi-tool, tweezers, and a flashlight in addition to the bandages and other standard first aid materials. I did need to purchase antibiotic ointment and an emergency blanket (helpful if there's an accident and someone goes into shock) to supplement the kit for him, but it seemed to have most of the other components I was looking for.",
