Plus with the cover over the absorbing pad, they don't stick to the dried blood/plasma & then tear it all open again. They stay on pretty well when damp, too, unlike latex, which slide right off if there's even the merest hint of moisture! Love these, they were a good deal, and they arrived quickly!",
