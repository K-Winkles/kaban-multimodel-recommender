In hindsight, a handful of those pouches can be purchased for this price and manually filled, but this saves you the work of overbuying in bulk and the first aid patch saves the trouble of labeling.In all, this is great value compared to other first aid kits available on Amazon, but you'll be hard pressed to find one with everything you think you might need for your particular lifestyle.
