                "reviewText": "There are definitely some merits to this, especially for $13. It feels a bit lacking in quality in some spots and excellent in others, though.The good: The clamshell case is solid built The zipper can get some snags on it like any other cheap zipper but it closes securely and I would believe their advertisement that the thing is water resistant. The aluminum whistle it comes with is phenomenal, though it only has two states: not working and full blast. The way it's built you have to give it a good blow to get some sound and by then it is loud. The fact it comes with multiple sets of gauze, some medical tape and ointments is a real win, since a kit this cheap with even any burn gel is pretty hard to find. You get a good few sting pads too, it's actually 4 even though the photo only shows 2.The bad: The scissors suck, no two ways about it. You'll be able to use them in a pinch but these things grind when you snip them. They feel like they weren't sharpened right, or were bent in production or.. something. Based on other comments that's just how these things are though. The fact this doesn't come with more than a single burn gel is also not exactly ideal, it would have been nice to see an extra one since if you need burn gel you're probably gonna want a spare just in case.The ugly: Like I said the zipper snags, so let's start there. Further, though I understand why, this kit is absolutely stuffed with bandaids where some extra burn gel or even sun protectant could have gone instead. Like, most of what you're getting is a decent clamshell case for your bandaids. Speaking of the case, despite being well built, it doesn't have very much room at all inside of it after the stuff that comes with it is in. This means if you want to add to the kit you'll likely have to take things out, meaning that the hit or miss kit you buy is what you get. It's going to be a pain for me to stuff in a few extra things I want in here - namely some pain pills and a small tube of itch cream for bites or rashes. If you're looking for a good basic case to add to, you might want to look elsewhere because you're going to be taking stuff out of here. Another thing I personally don't care much for is the addition of a tourniquet, ESPECIALLY without any instructions. A lot of people will freak out and use a tourniquet when it's not needed and end up doing catastrophic damage to their body due to it. It's immoral to add something like that to a kit and not tell people \"this is for emergencies, please do not use unless you are bleeding to death or missing a limb.\"My conclusion: It's fine enough for what I need but it might not be enough for you. I bought this as a backpacking medkit to toss in there and know if I get stung, burned or cut I'll have what I need in it. For that purpose it will serve me well, especially once I manage to jam some pain pills, itch cream and liquid bandage into the pack. If you want a first aid kit for your car though, I would be a bit more apprehensive. Unless you have a kid you won't need dozens of bandaids at a time, let alone the tiny button ones. For a car I would really suggest shopping around and getting something far more comprehensive than a .5 pound kit. You aren't going to see a car stranded/flipped on the road and walk up to them to ask if they need a bandaid, same for you if you end up in a crash or, more likely, on the side of the road with a headache or a dead battery. Due to that I really wouldn't suggest it for car use. For home or going outside generally though it's decent enough, even good aside from a few items you might be able to shove in.",

At least once a week, someone in our group was getting some fort of basic injury while playing so I decided to get this first aid kit. It\u2019s the perfect size to carry with is in our volleyball bag and has everything we need inside of it. I personally love the attached mini carabiner.",
