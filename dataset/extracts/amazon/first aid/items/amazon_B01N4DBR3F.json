After four days of using this product my ear is finally starting to heal.I only cleaned with a q-tip with water and the solution. I sprayed the solution front and back twice a day.Day 1/2- it caused a bump by the piercing, I cleaned with a q-tip only with water because I wanted to know if this product was truly worth to it.Day 3- the bump disappeared as well as the irritation and redness. Cleaned as usualDay 4- cleaned with water again, sprayed the solution. My piercing no longer hurts to touch.Also this product can be a little drying on the ear. I would use a light oil with a q-tip or your clean finger to apply lightly around the ear (not my piercing) after the solution is done drying. I am truly happy because I thought I would have to remove this, let it heal and pierce it later on!",
