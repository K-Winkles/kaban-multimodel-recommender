I have not used to for heat, but that is an option. This chills pretty quickly and stays cold long enough for a therapy session. I recommend getting 2 to rotate if you have a need for continuous cold therapy. The product comes with a Velcro strap that would be help ful if you are wrapping an arm or leg. It does not have a cloth cover so you will need a towel or ace bandage or other layer to protect the skin.",
