(Even the product page itself doesn\u2019t suggest it for those uses\u2013\u2013just home, car and sports.) This kit only has one finger splint and one ice pack\u2026no thermal blanket, tourniquet or antibiotic in here. Not even scissors.It does have tweezers, but I\u2019ve not been able to see it they effectively remove ticks.Generally good for what it is, a compact basic kit for minor scrapes and cuts. \ud83d\udc4d",

I came to realize that I didn't even have a bandage large enough for a scraped knee, and that made me feel so silly.I'm so glad to now have this really comprehensive first aid kit that is really well geared towards cuts and scrapes. It definitely had everything you would need to clean and treat a cut and SO MANY options for covering it.I feel a lot of peace knowing we have this in our home now, and it's all so neatly organized. We're so much more prepared for a medical situation than we were and I would recommend this for any family or even at a baby shower as a gift! It's super practical.",
