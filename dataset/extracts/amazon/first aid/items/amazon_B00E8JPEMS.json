                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the First Aid Only 21-770 Disposable Thermometer for Fever in a 10 Pack, and my experience with these thermometers has been nothing short of disappointing.First and foremost, the accuracy of these disposable thermometers is questionable at best. In comparison to traditional digital or oral thermometers, the readings from these disposable ones were inconsistent and often inaccurate. This lack of reliability is a significant concern, especially when dealing with health-related matters.The construction quality is subpar. The thermometers feel flimsy and cheap, giving a sense that they may break or malfunction easily. The packaging claims they are disposable, but the fragility of these thermometers makes them feel more like single-use items, contributing to environmental concerns.Furthermore, the design is impractical. The single-use nature of these thermometers makes them less cost-effective compared to reusable alternatives. Given their unreliability, the added environmental impact of disposing of these thermometers after a single use only adds to their overall drawbacks.The packaging is also less than convenient. It lacks clear instructions and proper organization, making it cumbersome to use these thermometers in urgent situations. The lack of clarity in the packaging only adds to the frustration of dealing with a product that doesn't deliver on its promises.In conclusion, the First Aid Only 21-770 Disposable Thermometer for Fever in a 10 Pack is a regrettable purchase. The questionable accuracy, flimsy construction, and impractical design make these thermometers a poor choice for anyone seeking reliable and cost-effective temperature monitoring. I would strongly advise against purchasing this product and recommend exploring more trustworthy alternatives for accurate and consistent temperature readings.",
