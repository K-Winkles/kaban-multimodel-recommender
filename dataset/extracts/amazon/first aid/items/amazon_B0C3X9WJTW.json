                "reviewText": "I ordered this bag in Large because of my autoimmune condition, which requires me to be on a \"pharmacy\" of medication and supplements. My husband and I travel often, and I needed something to keep my medication organized, while also being able to \"grab and go\" without much planning. I keep this bag by my bedside, and use it instead of my side drawer, and it has cleared up so much space... Not to mention I no longer spend time digging around my drawer for the proper meds at the right times. This medical bag has plenty of pockets, zippers, separated (easily removable) compartments, etc. Did I mention that it has a padded shoulder strap? It's made with a durable material, that seems like it will hold up over time, and the zippers don't seem to be the \"cheaply stitched\" zippers. Everything about this bag seems quality. Time will tell, but for now, I give it \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 and \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d. Enjoy!",

Our little bathroom has almost no storage, so I have things stashed everywhere. I got to thinking if I even had a minor cut I would have blood everywhere before I could find a box of bandaids, much less a roll of gauze and tape with scissors to cut them with. I did not want a tiny, premade first aid box. I wanted something that would easily hold bottles of peroxide and alcohol, ice packs, serious injury supplies, first aid book, gauze, tape, scissors, etc., etc. for us and our big dog. This bag fills the bill. It is pricey, but I think of it as peace of mind knowing I can lay my hands quickly on needed supplies in an emergency -- whether a minor emergency or something more serious.",

                "reviewText": "This is being reviewed for what it says it is, a travel medicine bag, not a first aid kit, not a doctor or nurse bag, not an EMT bag. Back a generation or two every man used to own what was called a toilet kit, which was essentially a way to carry his razor, toothbrush and other bathroom items when he traveled, things a woman would put in her purse. Back then about the only meds he would take is maybe a bottle of aspirin. Today\u2019s man whether he is young or old travels with at minimum three or four prescriptions plus pain meds, sleeping aids, and as many as 20 bottles of vitamin supplements. So this is essentially the toilet kit of the second decade of this century. I looked at pages of similar ones and settled on this one. Here are the things I like and those that could use improvement.WHY I CHOSE THIS ONEListed below are what made me choose this one and why:1. They specify in writing that their polyester is twice as heavy as some others. Since they give actual numbers and no one else does I had to trust them and go with the one that sounded most durable2. It has a handle. Maybe women would prefer a shoulder strap (which is included) but as a guy I prefer to be able to grab it and go3. It has a lot of pockets, dividers, and customizable open spaces. Some things I may carry, like a blood pressure cuff, may take more room than some other cases are designed to allow4. It has a full lining which looks water resistant and easy to clean, that\u2019s a big plus over some of the other similar productsREGRETSNot everything was roses though. The first issue was before I even got it. Their aid plainly says \u201csave 15% when you order 1 or more items\u201d so I put it in my cart and it added an unwanted and unneeded product that I didn\u2019t want that almost doubled the price. If I removed it the 15% went away. Thus it cost me more than advertised. Next, and very important, there are a lot of loops in the top section, and they show them with some bottles in them (not included) but unfortunately they made them too small to hold the most standard size of prescription bottle. I was looking forward to organizing my prescriptions (and putting vitamins in previously used bottles) but all of those loops are essentially useless, I\u2019ve never seen a prescription bottle in America that small. The next two things are minor inconveniences. One is that you get the product flat and you have to figure out how to attach the hook and loop dividers. It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. And related to that, the zipper to the lower compartment runs right into a rigid part of the interior that sticks out and it is a hassle to have to fight the zipper past it every time.YES NO MAYBEI would like to say this product is the best of its class which would automatically earn it five stars but the fact that the main reason I bought it is that it is described as a medicine bag organizer and because none of the loops can be used by me to hold medicine bottles that defeats the entire reason I chose it. I\u2019m not sending it back because it is the right overall size and I will just have to throw my pill bottles into the bottom portion, which can hardly be described as organizing them.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Items have to super impress me to get all five stars and this one truly did.The dividers are designed better than any other of these bags I've purchased and allow for multiple sized compartments. I unfortunately have a lot of medications I need to take with me when traveling and have never been able to fit anything into any one bag, so I didn't expect I would this one, but I was wrong. I fit everything I absolutely have to travel with, plus more in this bag. It will also hold a lot more so I can throw in some additional items that I also like to take with me just in case and be able to fit everything into this one bag.The more stuff I put in, the more it seemed to hold. It has a hand carrying strap, an adjustable shoulder strap, two side pockets, a front pocket, and a place for an ID or medical information card. The zippers come together and have holes where you can place a lock through them if you need to secure your medications in that way.It appears to be insulated which I feel will help with temperature control to prevent damage to medications.The double layers refers to having one large compartment layer that zips separately from a second layer that also zips separately on top of the bottom layer. I can store my bulkier items in the bottom layer, and then smaller items, while still being able to fit some medicine bottles, in the top layer.I am very impressed with this travel medicine bag, coming from someone who has to take a bunch of medications and have up until now, never been able to find a bag that organizes and holds everything I need and want to carry with me. I highly recommend this!",
