This vintage-looking first aid box is a great go-to box for everything you need for minor scrapes and bumps. The first aid box does not come with any supplies, so you can add whatever items you, your family or co-workers most frequently need. This wall mountable first aid box has two shelves that keep everything organized in three compartments. You can easily fit dozens of bandages, gauze pouches, and alcohol swabs, as well as antiseptic and other creams. If needed, you can clean the box \u2014 inside and out \u2014 with mild soap and a wet cloth. When not in use, you can close it with the buckle lock. This first aid box makes a great gift for a student heading to college, a new neighbor, or a housewarming gift.",

About what I expected, but with a few small dents. The paint job is terrible. The + sign isn't even centered, and there are smudges all over it that won't come off, as well as a lot of scratches, both of which, I assume were from the painting process. I wish they'd have just left the + sign off, rather than make the whole thing look terrible in the process.",
