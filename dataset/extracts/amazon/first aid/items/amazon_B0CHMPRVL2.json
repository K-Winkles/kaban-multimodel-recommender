Includes a face shield and CPR / first aid directions along with items to assist with bangs, scrapes, and cuts.Lots of antiseptic / alcohol wipes, adhesive bandages in a variety of sizes with a few butterflies, two sizes of gauze and tape, a small roller bandage and sling material, tongue depressors, one disposable cool pack, first aid scissors, safety pins, and tweezers, among other things. Also includes a couple of packets of burn ointment and triple antibiotic cream.The plastic case has a ring where you can wire it shut if the plastic buckles break off or if you are storing it standing up in a cabinet. Plastic is thick enough not to crack right away but isn\u2019t overly heavy. The handle can be bent out of the way or has holes so you can mount the whole kit to something, if you wish.I\u2019m not sure how watertight the plastic container is (or will stay), but it does have a gasket inside the cover to help with this.Manufacture date was January 2024 for kit received in early February 2024; expiration May 2026.",

                "reviewText": "It is a nice kit to have around the house or in the car for a simple first aid. It is a good value because it contains pretty much what you need for minor injuries and the price is right. The web page shows all the items contained. I also included the picture of the back which has the contents listed. I like that it shows expiration date which is useful because things like bandage adhesive goes bad when old. Bandages, by the way, is a regular kind and not the type to keep the water out.Some of the nice things in the kit are good scissors which works well to cut through gauze and clothing. Burn gel, antiseptic, and sting-relief pad will come in handy.The box itself is also good. It has a rubber seal for waterproofing. Its handle has screw holes which can be used for wall mounting. The handle also snaps onto the body for neat packing in a small space. It even has tabs for secure closing and it can be used to tell if it has been opened or not.Overall, I like it and I am glad to have gotten it.",

They even provided a quick saver mouth to mouth resuscitation device with clear and concise directions how to perform this life saving task. This is a really nice kit at an affordable price.

It is compact, the items are separated inside for ease of use, and it does have a bit of extra room for including additional items. The items in my kit such as alcohol wipes and ointment are labeled with manufacture and expiration dates. All items appear to have been manufactured less than a year ago and have expiration dates more than a year in the future. This would be a great basic kit to keep in your car for emergencies.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good, basic, inexpensive first aid kit. It includes most of the medical supplies you need in a first aid kit, but lacks the bells and whistles of more expensive kits. It is housed in a plastic box that seals sufficiently to keep out moisture. It also includes some cheap scissors, tweezers, gloves, masks, finger splints and safety pins, to make temporary treatments intended to last no longer than the time required to seek professional medical attention. In short, this is a kit intended for short term treatment only, and is adequate for that purpose.",
