Also a few packets of salt which, dumped into a bottle of water, gives a serviceable makeshift saline solution to clean and rinse off a minor cut or scrape before bandaging. Just a little protective pouch, nylon, lightweight, with at least some internal organization dividers, ready to toss in a daypack or jacket pocket\u2026and thus have at least something handy to deal with minor stuff. And one easily recognized for first aid in case it's my precious carcass I\u2019ve injured and asked someone else to dig around in my pack. Is this the most rugged-duty, best-constructed pouch? Probably not\u2026but it easily fulfills my needs and still has room to spare for additional items. Plus it comes as a twofer, for an incredible price! I couldn\u2019t be happier!",

I made one for work, since my workplace doesn\u2019t have much stuff in theirs\ud83d\ude12. And the other one is to help me carry smaller items like bandaids and such in my big first aid bag. Much easier to organize that way. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs these. They really come in handy, and you\u2019ll never know when you\u2019ll need it.",
