                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Covers the basics for short trips/day hikes in a good form factor",
                "reviewText": "I've purchased several Adventure Medical Kits first aid kits, and this one is on par with the rest. Overall, I like the size and form factor, combined with the clearly labeled compartments to find what you need fast, or for someone who is unfamiliar with your first aid kit to find things. Whether the labeling saying it covers a certain number of people for a certain number of days is accurate is debatable, but I think the contents are a good value for what you pay. Unless you are outfitting several medical kits, and therefore plan to buy the supplies in bulk, I don't think it's easy to buy the same contents individually for less cost - I've priced this out informally.All of the contents was as described, with the exception of the gauze pads. Some of the sizes were different than advertised, though the total quantity was the same. The Adventure Medical Kits web site states some contents may be substituted, and I feel the gauze pad substitutions were adequate. Additionally, the medications pack had an expiration date of about 20 months from the date of purchase, so I think that's more than acceptable as well.Note that this kit is pretty small (search for it on YouTube so you can see it in comparison to other objects; the size isn't easy to visualize from the picture), so if you want to add your own items, keep that in mind. You do have enough room to add things like extra bandages, gauze pads, and medications, even more so if you remove the medical guidebook, and flatter items fit better. However, if you plan to add any bulky items, like larger tourniquets, pressure bandages, etc., you'll want to look elsewhere. If you just plan to add more of what's already in the kit, or otherwise flat items, (especially if you remove the guidebook), you'll be fine. Keep in mind the size and form factor are meant for basic first aid for very short duration trips, not serious trauma care. Even the 5x9\" pad in the \"stop bleeding fast\" pocket isn't going to stop any bleeding for which a tourniquet would be suited or where you'd want a professional pressure bandage.I honestly can't think of any cons considering the intended purpose of this kit. If I had to think of any, I'd say the roll of medical tape is pretty short if you needed it for, say, taping up a sprained ankle rather than just taping on some bandages; they probably could have fit a longer roll. The elastic bandage and the compressed gauze roll also seem fairly short, and maybe could have been longer and in a flat-fold packaging rather than rolled. Including a flat-packed triangular bandage sling-and-swathe use would be nice, but gain, this seems to be intended as a very basic kit, and that's easy to add after the fact.One other note, is that there was oddly a folded up napkin (clean and unused, fortunately) in the pocket where the medical guidebook is, as someone else mentioned in one of the 1-star reviews. I contacted Adventure Medical Kits about this, which said, \"This was a design purpose for show when they were on display. So yes this was planned...\". I don't understand what display purpose this napkin could serve, but at least it was intended and doesn't indicate the packaging was tampered with. Additionally, the plastic tie holding the zipper closed was intact. I also contacted Tall Ridge, the Amazon Marketplace vendor (who Adventure Medical Kits confirmed to me is an authorized reseller), who said all of their products ship as they receive them from the manufacturer.",

                "reviewText": "It's smaller than I expected, which is good and bad - obviously it's easy to pack into a small space but the tourniquet I ordered will not fit in the \"Stop Bleeding Fast\" pocket as I was hoping... or any pocket for that matter. Also, the expiration date on the medication bag is only a year away. Those are my only complaints. For the price, this is a great option and isn't filled with an overabundance of bandages like other kits. It has just the essentials I was looking for: various bandages, medications, wipes, etc. The clearly labeled pockets should be quite helpful when looking for something in an emergency situation, and the inventory printed on the back could be useful for less urgent treatment or for restocking used supplies. Also, I checked to make sure all items are present, and they are. A great buy in my opinion!",
