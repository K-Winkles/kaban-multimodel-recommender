                "reviewText": "It's all about having what you need in an emergency when you're at home or away. I'm all about taking items like these when we go on vacation either by plane or car. The last thing I want to do is go to a local store or pharmacy and buy things that I could easily take with me from home. This is a great item ! I like the little \"back pack style bag\" and this could easily be attached to any full size back pack or belt and it will fit in any suitcase. If you are taking this on a carry on, I would remove any item that are not TSA approved. You can also customize the health/emergency items you would like to have on vacation or when you're hiking, camping etc. It's a good size and will fit a lot of items. I love the velcro American flag and medic symbol that are on this bag. It's very well made and there are several slots that you can add slim items if you want to ex: knife. Great value for the money and I highly recommend as this is something that will last a long time.",

If you try to price out building your own kit it would cost 10 times as much as what this kit costs and it wouldn't even include the bag. Everything that comes in this kit is geared towards general first-aid and it is a great value. The thing I love about this kit is that it works perfectly in almost any situation; on the water, in the wilderness, in your car or even just to keep in your home, it's got a plethora of items to use.This kit has everything you could need to help you through an emergency situation. The quality of the bag and the materials are great and I'm very impressed with the thoroughness of this kit. It's built to be taken with you on any of your adventures.We added additional band-aids as our kids go through quite a few of them but honestly, there are amazing products in here. Purchase with confidence!",
