He is an avid hunter and fisherman and with all the other gear one usually carries in the great outdoors this light weight bag simply attaches to a backpack or gun case. If you are looking for a kit for your car, this is not practical and there are many other options for that purpose. Who needs fishing line in a broken down car? I got this on sale for $27 and I couldn't be happier. It isn't for daily use, it's an emergency kit, so if you keep that in mind before you purchase you should be happy with this bag.",

Definitely a nice addition to my collection. Also the small bag holding everything is very nice too, it has straps which can connect to a bigger backpack to horde all your equipment on you at once, and comes with Velcro patches for it.",
