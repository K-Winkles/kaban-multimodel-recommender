This wrap holds gauze in place without getting stuck to the fur, so it's easy to remove later. I usually have to secure it with some adhesive tape on top to keep it from sliding down as he moves around. It's good for people bandaging too :)",

                "reviewText": "I used it on my German Shepherd's back paws to let his paw pad wound heal after he was nipped at the groomer. I tried using surgical tape first, but he kept removing it, licking the wound raw and making it worse. These cute camo wrap bandages did the trick. They stayed on, functioned well in place of booties, and were even machine washable. I wouldn't recommend using machine-washed tape for wound dressing, but it was fine to re-use as an outer wrap for walking in the snow to prevent rock salt from getting between his paws, or in the Summer to avoid walking on hot pavement. I've tried every kind of pet boot on him which never stays, on while this tape does.",
