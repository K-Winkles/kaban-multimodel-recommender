I like the different sizes, although for most people I always recommend the biggest as the most important, since you can cut them to size if needed but it's hard to make one bigger. The included bag is great, although the bandage tape/Koban/krolex/vet wrap, whatever you call it, is definitely on the cheaper side.These are a great addition when further away from help, but I cannot stress practice enough. These aren't as simple to use (properly) as you might think. I believe they will hold up well and even the name brand ones aren't going to return to their original state perfectly. I have some taped up to cover sharp edges and wrinkled like paper, but they still work. These will likely last just as long.",
