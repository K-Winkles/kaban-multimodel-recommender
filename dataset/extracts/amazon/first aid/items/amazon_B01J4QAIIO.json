            "[MORE THAN JUST BANDAGES]: Have you ever purchased a first aid kit with 589,234 pieces and felt like you got ripped off? Our kit includes over 250 items that you'll actually use. We don't \"pad the numbers\" with tons of bandaids to make it seem like you're getting more in your kit. Our staff includes former EMT's who (between sweeping the floors and taking out the trash) help design our kits with real-world supplies such as a Tourniquet, Chest Seal, Roll Splint, Extrication Collar, Airways & More",
            "[MAKE ANYWHERE YOU GO YOUR HOSPITAL]: The MB50 gear bag is designed to be mobile! With a reinforced carry handle and an adjustable, padded shoulder strap this gear bag and fill kit can go anywhere you go. Perfect for schools, sports, special events, camping, hiking, offices, warehouses, concerts, ball games, day cares, fire departments, rescue squads, POV's, helicopters, space ships, your ex's house... scratch that, you should probably stay away from there",
            "[WE'VE GOT YOUR BACK]: Lightning X has nearly 25 years of experience designing gear bags for first responders. We take feedback very seriously, and work to make our bag designs better and stronger (because if anyone can break something, first responders can). We stand behind our products, and that's why all of our gear bags are backed by a limited lifetime warranty. No, you can't throw your trauma bag out of an airplane, but if it breaks for any reason due to how we made it, we'll replace it",
            "[DIMS + COLORS]: The MB50 EMT Trauma Bag is available in Red, Blue and Fluorescent Orange color choices. The bag measures 28\" (L) x 13\" (W) x 12\" (H) when closed"
