                "reviewText": "I\u2019m a minimalist that likes to have things on hand when needed. There\u2019s been many times That I\u2019ve experienced cuts or wounds and have nothing on me to cover it up. This kit is very portable and compact. The best part if they give you a bonus pack that can be strapped to a Molle pack. I recently got burned at work and this kit was perfect to help stop the bleeding until I was able to tape up the would at home. Is it a trauma kit no but it will get the job done when necessary. Would recommend others to buy for family emergencies or just personal car emergency kits for everyday life.",

Both are durable and easy to find in an emergency, and have everything you need for immediate first aid needs.Compared to others, I like that I don\u2019t have to pack a travel size first aid or pay to have a secondary travel friendly kit, and kit is big enough to handle the minor scrapes, cuts, bruises and burns no problem. Well worth it.",
