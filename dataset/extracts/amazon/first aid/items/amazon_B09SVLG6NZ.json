All'interno c'\u00e8 una bustina di ghiaccio sintetico che una volta \"ghiacciato\" ho trovato difficoltoso inserire all'interno del peluche. Secondo me non raffredda un granch\u00e9, usato solo una volta. L'idea \u00e8 molto bella per i bambini, ma nn consiglio l'acquisto in quanto l'ho trovata poco utile.",
