                "reviewText": "This fabulous product has been around for 60+ years. When I was a toddler I was fascinated by the flame of the hot water heater. I was looking at it one day through the little window with my little hand on the spigot which wasn't tightened down (c'mon great uncle!). I accidentally turned the hot water on. Back in the early 50's it was common to keep the water very, very hot. My back and neck was scalded. I was rushed to the local small town doctor who pealed off my clothing and applied the new product introduced to him - Foille. I have no scars and have used it all these years (I'm 64 now). I have given it to family members who have spent too much time in the sun and gotten very burned. It takes the \"fire\" out and promotes fast healing. Some find the smell unpleasant, but I don't. Use old clothing & bedding in case it stains.It is great for all burns, insect bites, even cuts. My cuts/burns/bites heal faster with Foille than with Neosporin or other first aid ointment.I don't go anywhere without my Foille!!",

My father burned his face in 1970 when the hot radiator of our car exploded on his face with boiling hot water. Each time my aunt used the ointment and neither have a scar. It is now helping my uncle who is mostly bed ridden and bed sores are kept at bay and any other abrasion of skin. Our family calls this the \"Miracle Ointment\". I couldn't believe it was being sold on Amazon. Worth every penny and more. I highly recommend it since I've seen the results of the product.",
