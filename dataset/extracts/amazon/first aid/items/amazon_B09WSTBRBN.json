It goes on very thin, even with two coats. I could hardly tell I had it on, and it survived multiple hand washes during my work day. A must have for anyone who needs to wash their hands more than usual throughout their day.",

It does work ok on my arms and back of my hands if I use 2-3 coats. Those scratches seem to be scarring so far, I don\u2019t know if this should\u2019ve prevented that but I guess it doesn\u2019t. Still better than regular bandages for lots of tiny scratches though (in my case from toddler fingernails, if you play with cats a lot you might have similar scratches). I think the lidocaine works ok, there was a very light sting for a second but not as bad as the old regular stuff as far as I can remember.",

The cap is a pain to get on and off. I'm a mechanic and most of the time I use a product of this nature it is on my hands/fingers. This makes the long drying time and \"safety cap\" both no-goes in my book. It also wears off more quickly than other products of this type. It does seal the skin and it does not sting on application, both reasons for the 3 star rating.",

                "reviewText": "I had hoped that Bactine MAX Liquid Bandage would offer a reliable and convenient solution, but unfortunately, it fell woefully short of my expectations. Contrary to a typical liquid bandage, the texture of this one resembles milk \u2013 thin, runny, and exceedingly drippy.The application is a hassle due to its long drying time, and surprisingly, it maintains a tacky residue even after drying \u2013 if it ever truly does. The lack of clear instructions exacerbates the overall unsatisfactory experience, leaving users like myself unsure of the proper drying duration.Furthermore, the product boldly claims to have a \u201cno sting\u201d formula, but this is blatantly untrue. The application was accompanied by an uncomfortable stinging sensation, completely contradicting its promise.In summary, Bactine MAX Liquid Bandage has been a complete letdown, failing to live up to its advertised benefits. Its misleading claims, poor consistency, and the absence of crucial usage instructions have ensured that I won\u2019t be making a repeat purchase.",
