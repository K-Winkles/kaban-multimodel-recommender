                "reviewText": "I purchased this kit for a vehicle, and it is very compact (about the size of a large adult hand). The variety of items in this pack was great, but I would probably give it three stars as a family first aid kit. The pack does include something for stings, but other than that, there are not any medication supplies (as seen in the list of items on the kit's description). I'm not sure why a mirror & fishing kit were more important than antibiotic ointment and painkillers. I had to purchase medications separately, and I found most of the medications I wanted with the Pak-Kit and with PreparaKit's First Aid Kit Refill Bag . This Swiss Safe kit was packed fairly tight, but I was able to add a few things.Items NOT included (some more important than others) are: painkillers (Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen), nasal decongestant, antihistamine & allergy meds, antacid, motion sickness meds, antibiotic ointments, burn cream, hydrocortisone cream, lip balm, or sunscreen.I was also hoping for a waterproof pack, but this at best would be water resistant. If I spill water on it, I think it would hold up to that, but if I dropped the kit in water, I do not have high hopes for its water resistance. Most of the items ARE individually bagged, so if water gets in, they may stand a chance of being salvageable.Overall, this was a decent deal for the price but needs some improvement.",

We wanted an all in one, includes everything in it kit that we could toss in the backseat or throw in a backpack. It had to be sturdy enough not to crush and easily found.Well, this fit all the requirements. It opens either way so it hold more variety and that's both good and bad. It has a bit of everything but not a lot of anything. It's perfect for a road trip, but make sure you have stuff to refill when you get home.All in all, I feel safer with it than without. That alone makes it worth it. But when you need it, you really realize how worth it, it truly is.I would recommend, seriously get this. It's a great value, it's perfect for around the house or shop... and great for traveling. Nice and sturdy.",
