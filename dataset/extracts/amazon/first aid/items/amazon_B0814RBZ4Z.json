I bought a pre-built med kit to put in here and everything fit, but it was a little tight. The only thing I don't like about the kit is how the straps on the bottom hold the tourniquet. There really isn't anything securing it, the straps just kind of go over top of it. I wouldn't trust it to keep the tourniquet in place. Aside from that, the pouch is good to go.",

                "reviewText": "1st: I am no expert in any way, doubly so when it comes to IFAK/CLS topics.TLDR=Over all I think it's better than the price suggests. I'm not disappointed nor pleasantly surprised. Would recommendDetails:-The pouch seems to be built well enough to be used as intended.-The material and stitching are good but not \" fine work\".- It's big enough inside to fit all the items pictured below (basic IFAC with some extras) with a little extra room as to keep the contents from being damaged by being crammed in.-The retention strap doesn't really tighten down as much as removes it's own slack.-The loop on the bottom that is implied to be used as a TQ holder is too small to be used as such and is not stretchy.-the \"handle\" used to pull pouch off of the carrier doest really fold out of the way, it will likely snag on stuff. I was able to roll it and tuck it slightly between the pouch and carrier, but with heightened activity it will come out and snag. (I will likely modify the handle)",
