                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Good value and quality for an in-home first aid kit.",
                "reviewText": "This is a very nice container for first aid supplies. As others have noted, it is not a super heavy-duty container that would be suitable for use when, say, scaling a mountain. However, for storage of basic first aid supplies at home or even in your car, this is a great solution.It is surprisingly roomy - I have included photos of what was put in the kit to give an idea of how much it can hold. I like the clear plastic so you can see the contents, the removable tray on the top is very handy, the handle is sturdy enough to carry a full container, and the latch seems fairly secure.Engaging the latch is somewhat tricky - the plastic is quite flexible and when trying to fasten the latch, the plastic bends inward and away from the latch itself. The removable tray is key to getting this to work as it is rigid enough to hold the front portion of the container in place for the latch to fasten. Even so, it is a bit difficult to securely latch. A stronger, more rigid plastic would fix this issue, but there you go.I particularly liked how this was basically just a big open space to store variously sized items easily. The design is very flexible for whatever you need to store in it. For instance, it is deep enough that I was able to put in a tall bottle of disinfectant and a large box of latex gloves. You can further organize the items inside with smaller containers. I wish I still had all my bandages in their original boxes, for instance. That would have been handy!Overall - this is a good, lightweight case for storing basic first-aid supplies and is a very good price. I would say that this is not durable enough for frequent or strenuous use, but for the average home needs this is a good choice.",

                "reviewText": "I really like the large size of this first aid box. It allowed me to customize exactly what I wanted to send with our college student to the dorm. I had been looking everywhere for something that was large enough to allow DayQuil and NyQuil Bottles to stand vertically but also had a tray to keep the smaller items organized. This was perfect! I packed a lot into this kit, and I like that it\u2019s clear plastic with red accents.2 suggestions regarding the negative reviews I had read that pertained to the latch and absence of the First Aid Emblem. Regarding the latch, if you simply apply pressure at the bottom of the red latch, it will not close/latch. However, if you put your thumb at the top of the red latch and apply pressure as you are simultaneously sliding your thumb down to the bottom of the red latch, it will close/latch perfectly every time. Just make sure to maintain pressure as you slide your thumb from the top of the red latch to the bottom. I made sure to show my family members how to do it so they didn\u2019t assume it was broken.Regarding the complaint of it no longer having a First Aid emblem- I ordered really nice first aid stickers from Amazon. You can find the stickers on Amazon at https://a.co/d/1NsjDjb.",

                "reviewText": "This medicine bin is so cheaply made it's hard to grasp that the seller is charging $24.99 for it. Wow is all I can say. I spent days reviewing every medicine container on Amazon, searching for the right size with a handle. On paper, this one fit the bill, but this thing had to cost the manufacturer pennies on the dollar to produce. The insert tray is extremely wonky and cheaply made, the handle is thin and wispy, the hinges are downright junk that I doubt will be long for this world. To quote my husband, \"This thing is a piece of crap garbage.\" It does get 5 stars when it comes to being lightweight, though. So lightweight, I doubt it will last very long. If you want something sturdy, do not waste your money on this junk.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a container to store all of my household first aid items in and decided to purchase this. It is a perfect size and has lots of storage room. My only issue is that the latch that closes the container is extremely hard to use. Getting it to actually latch closed is near impossible after opening the box for the first time. So it sits open in my linen closet. Having to leave the product open means it is not portable since the handle to carry it is on the lid as well. If the latch worked, it would have been a 5 star product.",
