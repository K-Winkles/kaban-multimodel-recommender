It is heavy and bulky, but the amount of stuff packed into this little bag is absolutely worth it. The feral rod sparks good, the knives are sharp, the tools are practical. It is not all you need for a first aid kit if you are out for an extended time, but the necessary components are there!Many tools are multi use, the bracelet just itself is a paracord, a whistle, a compass, and a feral rod!The first kit I bought was for my son who likes to camp and play in the woods. Since then I have bought one for my husband, mother, and nephew. All of them do varying amount of \"adventuring\" ranging from a tent in the back yard, to hiking the Appalachian trail!",
