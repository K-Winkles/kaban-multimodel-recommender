                "reviewText": "I had to use these last summer when my nephew fell and split his forehead. We cleaned the wound which was a small gash about half an inch long and applied one of these stick-on sutures and took him to the dr to check if he needed stitches. Dr took a look and said just keep it on and it should heal with less scarring than if he stitched it.After this I had to buy some more to keep on hand in the first aid kit. Would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "The review of this product is for the quality of the product and not the functionality. I purchased these for my vacation home that is located far away from a hospital. I have said that if an injury occurs that requires these bandages, a visit to the ER is also necessary. However these seem like something that would be good to have until we can seek the professional medical attention.The kit comes with two different sizes bandages as well as alcohol swabs and large gauze bandages to place over the wound. All in all, this is a great kit that has everything you would need to close the wound. But again these are fairly heavy duty wounds. I don\u2019t think I would use these without an additional visit to the ER",

                "reviewText": "My husband takes blood thinners which means every little scrape becomes a serious injury. He compounds the problem because he is an outdoorsman and hard worker who can't sit still, exposing himself and his body to a lot of opportunity for injuries. I've had to mend him quickly many times in the past couple years so when I saw this kit I was very excited at the concept. Instead of fumbling with multiple butterfly band aids to close a longer incision, this allows you to place the tape and pull it tight with just a couple of quick moves. Makes me feel like an expert!",
