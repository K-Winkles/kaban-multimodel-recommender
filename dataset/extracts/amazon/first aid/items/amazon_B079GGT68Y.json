But they'll work for first aid. Have to remember that fist aid is just that - immediate relief until you can get to a doctor if required. They do have several worthwhile components like 2 triangular bandages (useful for a sling) and (cheap) tweezers and scissors. But included in the component count are 20 \"cotton swabs\" - Q-tips, basically. A few would be useful but 20? There's a \"tourniquet\" that wouldn't do much, 6 safety pins ... okay, if you use the triangular bandages for an arm injury 1 or 2 safety pins would be useful. Worth the money but will only handle superficial injuries on a temporary basis. Just know what you're buying.",
