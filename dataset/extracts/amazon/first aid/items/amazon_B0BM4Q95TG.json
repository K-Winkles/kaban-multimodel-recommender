                "reviewText": "The kit itself and the materials inside of the Life Safety Pro are very high quality and seem very durable. The size is super convenient for me and I can easily attach to my backpack. And my favorite feature is how organized the kit is. Everything is labeled and easy to find so if there is a emergency I won\u2019t be wasting time. This kit give me some peace of mind with the way my kids run around and play.",
