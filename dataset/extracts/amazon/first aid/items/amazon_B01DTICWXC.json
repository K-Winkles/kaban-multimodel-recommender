I'm not sure that there is no possibility of cross contamination so that may be a negative, but that is the only thing I'm not crazy about. If you use q-tips or some other applicator to scoop out an amount rather than using a finger on it, it would probably be a best practice. I used this on several different little cuts I've had over the past few months and it keeps the skin moisturized without being sticky or attracting dirt. None of the places I've used it on became infected and they have all healed well, so I guess it works! It also smells good, which is nice.",
