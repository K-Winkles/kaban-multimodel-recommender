I tested out whether I could even use it one-handed - i.e., the worst case scenario - and indeed I could. Seems like it could withstand some serious use if ever pressed into service.Practically speaking, I would find it hard to imagine using a tourniquet more than once in a real world situation (would dispose of it after covered in blood!) but this will most certainly last as needed, so no concerns here.Better safe than sorry. Hope it stays in its plastic wrapper from now on.",
