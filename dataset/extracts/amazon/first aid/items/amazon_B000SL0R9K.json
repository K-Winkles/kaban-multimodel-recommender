                "reviewText": "The little bag is sort of a hard shell case. It has all the goods you have come to expect in a road or home first aid kit. I like that carabiner too, not that I know where to hang the kit. I guess you can hang it on your backpack or belt if you're hiking or mountain biking. Definitely not for hanging onto a rope when rock climbing though. hahaEverything is well packed and the transparent pockets seem to fit everything perfectly, which makes me think that the manufacturer really thought this through. Inside the first aid kit are hella bandages of many sizes, gauze pads of many sizes, alcohol prep pads, antiseptic pads, anaesthetic pads, tape, gloves, a pair of scissors, tweezers... I guess the standard stuff. I like how the bandages differentiate from \"sterile guaranteed\" to \"non-sterile\". The prep pads, antiseptic pads (benzalkonium chloride), and anaesthetic \"sting\" pads (benzocaine) look so similar in size and shape, and are all enclosed inside the same pocket flap, so it's a good idea not to panic when treating someone/yourself and read the labels carefully, which are in clear and huge fonts anyway. As well, I recommend you read the little guide included in one of the pockets, as there are some information on providing aid in cases of poisoning, open wounds, bleeding, choking, shock, burns, fractures, dislocations, heat strokes, and even fainting.One thing I did not expect the kit would have is a red whistle, which even comes with a yellow lanyard so you can hang it on your neck. I can really see this as vital for \"commuters\" or when hiking or mountain biking as perhaps a \"last attempt\" for getting help from passersby.Overall, I really like my first aid kit. I bought this to prepare my emergency 72-hour kit. At first I wanted to just buy the stuff separately, but now I see that the entire kit is well worth the money. It's cheap on Amazon too! I highly recommend it, and the \"AAA\" branding is a nice, comforting touch too.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent kit. Has all the basic necessity needed for a bike commuter.The outer shell:It's a bit bulky but it fits snugly inside my Topeak trunk bag. Conversely, the shell feels robust enough to have it attached outside my bag without having to worry about it cracking under pressure if I were to fall or run into something.Unlike the plastic box, the bright red color really catches your eye and the zipper allows the case to deform and hold whatever you shove inside securely.The only flaw I see is the clear vinyl pockets that may rip. Mesh would have been a better option for a see through and expandable pocket.Content:Attached is a picture of everything that is included in the kit.This kit is sufficient for everyday minor injuries.The tweezer feels a bit cheap and you may want to replace it.Everything else seems neatly organized and packaged properly.Extra stuff:It's nice that the case is able to hold extra item so I went ahead and placed the following inside:PenSmall \"Field notes\" notepad3 advil pills3 plastic ziploc bags3 packets of Pedialyte (electrolyte packets for dehydration)small, hand sanitizersafety pins4 medium gauze padsa roll of waterproof adhesive tape (bikers tends to get sweaty)metal tweezersConclusion:I am very content with this kit and will purchase another one for my car.Please review the first aid instruction included beforehand and familiarize yourself on how to use each item effectively. (I didn't know alcohol prep and antiseptic towelettes are different and are used differently)You'll never know when you'll need this and I wish I had purchase this sooner since accidents do happens when you least expect it.(Unrelated, but an older lady fell off her bike on a bike trail and literally ripped her skin open to where the skin was flapping and her bones was peeking underneath. Had I had this first aid kit, I would have been able to clean the wound, apply butterfly bandage, apply pressure with clean gauze, wrap the wound, and elevate her arm with the triangular bandage.)Hopefully this review helps and I will update it periodically.",
