It did what it was supposed to do, but it creeped me out having this milky white area on the bandage where the actual wound is. I learned later that this is what it is supposed to do, but I wonder if other people felt the same. We aren't instruction readers, we Americans. Anyway, I can't find the Band-Aid ones any more, but these are even better. You can buy them in this size and cut them to whatever size you need. They are also much cheaper than the old Band-Aid brand that only came in one size and it was pretty small. You can get a better seal with these because even when you cut them down to the size you need, you can get a good perimeter around the wound that seals completely.",

                "reviewText": "I have developed type 2 diabetes due to a number of factors outside of my control. As a result, I am unable to clean in the house normally, and things get stacked up. I have cut my legs really badly a couple of times on some of these things that have stacked up, literally removed all of the layers of skin creating a terrible open wound. I did not find these bandages right away, so I don't know how effective they would be on the initial wounds, however, once the granulation tissue is growing (this is the tissue that grows before the replacement skin/scar tissue grows in), I have found them extremely effective! I'm not a doctor and I don't play one on TV, but there is a lot of knowledge out there if you look in the right places. When in doubt - CONSULT MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS!!!! They can help you identify the best products for your current need!I would also like to say that there is a big question you should always remember to ask when choosing a product:Is this product appropriate for what you want to use it for? For example, acne or large pressure sores (bedsores) - this product is no appropriate for! Definitely not.Acne requires exfoliation and cleansing on a regular basis (twice a day minimally - and other products like tea tree oil soap or other acne products are more appropriate for that. Covering acne up with bandages in most situations is just going to make it worse.Bedsores are pressure sores. They require rigorous attention, frequent dressing changes and for the pressure that caused the bedsore to be relieved for healing!!!Because of the type 2 diabetes, the skin on my legs and feet especially, is compromised. I am not healing as fast as I should. So, with daily dressing changes, cleansing carefully with gentle wound cleansing products and dressing with sterile bandaging and a prescription antibiotic ointment to help keep the wound from getting infected, it slowly got to a point where the granulation tissue had grown. That's when I found these hydrocolloid bandages.I immediately ordered some to try. These bandages are meant to stay on for up to 7 days. they are fully waterproof (though I have learned that really hot water or conditions tends to compromise them so be careful about that! lol) Wearing work gloves with one on my finger caused it to get gooey and stretchy and then it hardened up where it got gooey and stretchy, but as long as it stays on, it still protected and seemed to do its job.One of the other things that I found is that it is important to ensure that the size of the bandage is plenty large - it needs to fully cover the wound with, I would say a minimum of a half inch of additional bandage around the wound area. This is because of the \"hydro\" part. The bandage works with your bodies immune system and so it absorbs fluids. As the product details inform, a white bubble may appear over the wound - this is fluid collecting. This collection does seem to make the bandage under the area where the fluid collected less adhesive (no surprise really). So the extra bandage around the edge of the wound will help to ensure it remains waterproof and that it continues to adhere well.The wound on my leg has accelerated healing and after only three weeks (and three of these 4\" bandages) it is almost completely healed up now. I'm applying one more, and I expect that next week at this time, when I remove that 4th bandage, the granulation tissue will be gone and normal scar tissue will have finished forming. Until then, gotta keep the bandage on!This bandage is also supposed to be antibacterial and help with pain. Once I applied the bandages, I hardly knew I had a bad wound on my leg, so they must be doing something right lol.I would like for the packaging to describe more how they are antibacterial and how they help with pain because I like to understand how every product or medication that I use is working. but, aside from that small lack of info, I am super happy to have found these hydrocolloid bandages!I also used on for a slice across my finger - I had a little trouble keeping this one on at first because it's over a knuckle but it eventually adhered well (the extra around the edge was important here)And, when I told my doctors about them, they knew what they are and reacted very positively to my choice to use them for these wounds, so that made me feel pretty good as well.I definitely recommend these bandages! However, I also recommend that if you don't understand the proper use (and that's ok!) seek medical advice for the best bandages for your needs! :-)",

Although I was using the guard it slipped and I sliced a large chunk of skin off my thumb near my knuckle past the white meat! Since it was the holiday I didn\u2019t want to spend it in the hospital or urgent care. I probably should have gotten stitches it was bad! It bled for over four hours but I kept wrapping it in gauze. Well eventually it stopped bleeding but the gauze got stuck on the wound and to peel it off hurt more than the injury itself. I did some research and heard about these bandages on You Tube. I had a small piece of gauze still stuck to the wound and I was afraid it would cause an infection. Cleaned wound put bandage on for three days,by the third day the gauze came off while putting the next a new bandage on. No pain!! I\u2019m very impressed and keeping the wound moist as opposed to airing it out is the key to healing perfectly!",

Seems to work well if you can figure out the packaging",

It provides extra protection from clothing rubbing on the affected area. The adhesion is great and can be worn in the shower with no problems. Make sure that you skin is clean, dry, and free from any oils/lotions before applying. You could wear these for multiple days. Removing was a little tricky because they really don't want to come off. I use a medical adhesive remover pad to remove and it works perfectly. Would highly recommend.",
