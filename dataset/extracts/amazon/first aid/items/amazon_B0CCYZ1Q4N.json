We started using in on or around January 6th and by January 28th her scar is so much better it is amazing after only 3 weeks. This tape sticks super well as we have only replaced it because we needed to, never because it has started to become loose or pull away. Even after 5 or 6 days of continually wearing this tape in the bath, shower, to bed, with clothes, doing regular daily activites and going to physical therapy this tape has never once started to come loose. I am very glad that I spendt the extra few dollars and bought this rather than trying to save a few bucks.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve only been using this product for about a week so can\u2019t speak for its long term results. However, silicone is the only ingredient proven to be beneficial in aiding in diminishing the appearance of scars so I\u2019m confident it will help.I never thought I\u2019d get more than 3 days per strip of this stuff but I\u2019m actually on day 6 right now! I put it on Sunday night. Monday night I just took it off, (be careful if it\u2019s a new scar and still tender) set it aside to shower and just stuck it back on when the area was dry. Tuesday, same thing. Wednesday, I noticed it seemed to have a couple of small particles on it so I took a bit of mild soap (just squeezed it onto my finger and applied it directly to the strip) and gently rubbed it up and down the strip. Then I rinsed it (containing to rub it under the water) using lukewarm water then laid it sticky side up over a towel. When I got out of the shower it still had some water particles on it so I just blew them off and it was like new again. Thursday night I realized when I was in the shower that I had forgotten to even take it off! Seemed fine though so I just left it on until the next night. Friday night it wasn\u2019t quite as sticky anymore but after rubbing it a bit I managed to get it secured again. Tonight (Saturday) I\u2019ll take it off and start with a new strip.I am EXTREMELY impressed. The roll is quite a bit longer than I was expecting and you can easily cut it to fit your needs so it will last a really long time providing you don\u2019t have really big scars or many to use it on.How well it works for you would be dependent on many factors though. Where you put it of course will effect how many uses you might expect to get. Areas that move a lot probably would be better suited for a silicone gel treatment instead.Also, just your skin. Some people just have less sticky skin. I don\u2019t get clammy and have never sweat a lot so I stay pretty dry throughout the day.Lastly, I got these for my breast augmentation scars and am still in the faze that I have to wear a supportive bra 24/7. The fact that I put these on and then put something over them that holds them in place, probably helps a lot as well.I agree with others, keep the plastic pieces to put the strips on when you take them off. I (of course) forgot so used cling wrap instead which worked well also.Hope this helps someone. Happy healing all :)",

Sticks really well and if it stops sticking, just run some water over it. I use a 4\" long strip for about 7-8 nights. You can use them for longer, but I just like having a fresh piece every week. Great product and definitely helps keep the scar softer and contributes to the healing process.",

Other brands of silicone tape I\u2019ve used I can wear for 12-20 hours with no issues and reuse them many times. Not worth the cost to have a one time use tape.",
