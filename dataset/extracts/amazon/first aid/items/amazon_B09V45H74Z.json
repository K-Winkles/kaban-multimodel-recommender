It\u2019s very similar to the IFAK they issue in the Marine Corps.The case seems extremely durable, and there\u2019s a secure buckle and convenient molly-ing on the outside. Everything inside is packaged in plastic so that it is waterproof, and it is thoughtfully organized. There\u2019s a little pouch on the inside for basic first aid, which I like as well.The instruction booklet is straightforward and easy to understand. The only thing that is kind of a negative is the weight\u2014it\u2019s heavier than I expected\u2014 but that\u2019s gonna be relatively unavoidable if you want to carry as many supplies as what comes in the kit.God forbid I need to use it, but I sure feel a lot better having it!",
