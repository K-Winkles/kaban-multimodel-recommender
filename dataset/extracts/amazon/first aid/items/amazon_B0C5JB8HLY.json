                "reviewText": "I was more than surprised and happy with this purchase. This kits is perfect for a 24 hour go-bag or trunk of your car. Includes a lot of everyday items that would most commonly be used such as different sized bandaids, gauze, wraps, etc... Along with items that are a huge plus, such as trauma sheers, first-aid \"how to\" card for those that are not well-versed in emergency aid and others! Great kit for the price, and will be purchasing several more for all vehicles and bags!",
