Especially with the state of the world these days, you never really know when something bad will happen.I'm trained in first aid, and I've always kept some basic kits on hand just about everywhere you would need them (car, garage, in-house, etc...). But having this kit really is a game changer for the life safety services that I can provide to not only my immediate loved ones, but anyone at any time.You can clearly see the contents of the kit in the product photos, so I won't review those, but I will say that EVERY single item is high-quality and well designed/thought out.I have full confidence going forward with this bag on hand. I don't travel without it now.For this price, the peace of mind you get is 10 times the value. Huge thank you to this company for putting together a well made first aid kit.",

                "reviewText": "fantastic fully stocked first aid kit at a really nice price. the bag is well made with everything you would want. bright red color and reflectors with heavy duty stitching. for quick easy locating and identification. nicely stocked, added a few extras like cold packs and alcohol pads which tend to be used quickly. overall an excellent kit that i keep in the trunk of my car to be prepared. 5* product despite needing to add some things i feel are essential. for the price, a similar kit from a well known retailer would be double the price",

It is super well made and has pockets and space for everything you might want and then some. I ordered it to keep in my house, so that everything would be in one place - but it also would be a fantastic on the go bag in a car or on a vacation. The Bag itself is very well made - and would withstand quite a bit of wear and tear.",
