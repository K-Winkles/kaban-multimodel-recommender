I found this little kit and it's adorable: everything from bandaids to medical tape, a safety pin, nail clippers and stickers. The only thing I added was some baby clippers (the ones in here are full size) and character bandaids instead of generic (because we all know Baby Shark bandaids are magic compared to generic, right?). I was also pleasantly surprised to see the quality: instead of the typically plastic tweezers and whatnot these are actually metal ones.That said, it probably won't make it through TSA but it's perfect for the Mama on the go and the perfect size for a purse or diaper bag!",

It\u2019s small enough that it fits anywhere- purse, diaper bag and even under the edge of the carseat. It has everything I have needed for my kids when we have those unexpected boo-boos. (Like, when the trip and skin their knee on the way in or out of the doctor\u2019s office- when you\u2019re already running late.). It even saved my oldest daughter at prom- when she unexpectedly needed safety pins. I thought it was a little pricey, but I\u2019ve had my first one for over a year and bought a back up just in case. It\u2019s definitely durable because after a year of constant use- no rips, tears and the zipper and elastic still work great. Just remember to restock if you use something- because it doesn\u2019t hold a lot- but definitely holds what\u2019s needed for any day out.",
