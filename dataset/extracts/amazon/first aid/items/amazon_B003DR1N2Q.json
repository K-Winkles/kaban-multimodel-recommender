That\u2019s not going to happen with individual packets.The packets are .5g - .5oz tube is 14.2g, 25 ct box of these is 12.5gReceived Sept. 2022, expires March 2025Made in IndiaEach 25ct box was sealed in plasticSame 3 listed ingredients as original NeosporinThe narrow packet in the picture is the typical triple antibiotic packet you find in workplace first aid boxes which are .7g. These triple antibiotic packets are .5g and should be sufficient for most small scrapes, cuts or burns. Ointment removed from packet and placed next to a penny in the picture. I removed every last drop, you will most likely not get this much out under normal circumstances. The ointment was close to the same height and width as a penny. You might have a difficult time tearing open the packet if you have blood or sweat on your fingers. The packets seem like they would hold up well, they are not thin and easily opened by normal handling or compressing the packets. They need to be forcefully torn open.I would recommend these and will buy again when more are needed.",

                "reviewText": "Just FYI these are 0.5g and not 0.9 as advertised. They are very small packets measuring 2 1/2in x 1 3/8in, but they are great for first aid kits. There\u2019s probably enough in there for a very small cut. You\u2019d have to use multiple packets for a bigger wound, but these are perfect for traveling and on-the-go bags in case you need ointment.",
