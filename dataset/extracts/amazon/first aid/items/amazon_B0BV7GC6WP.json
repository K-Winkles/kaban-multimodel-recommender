We've combined all three kits in one compliance kit to make it easier for you to have all of the required supplies in one place and in one kit. We've built this kit for use in even the toughest work environments. The rugged, red kit container is waterproof, indestructible, impenetrable and has an advanced locking system that keeps the case closed and your supplies secure until you need them. This kit is lightweight and easy to carry to work sites or areas where supplies are needed to treat emergencies. This case includes a soft grip handle that is ergonomically friendly for easier carrying. The total dimensions of this kit are 15.8 x 12.1 x 6.8 inches. Large interior compartment makes it easy to find the supplies you need when you need them. The included Stop the Bleed Kit has the supplies you need to treat severe bleeding including a military style tourniquet, a chest seal and a bleeding control dressing. The Biohazard clean up kit includes all of the supplies you need to quickly and safely clean up biohazard fluids like blood, vomit or urine. It includes the required PPE protection supplies as well as absorbent powder and scoop and scraper to clean up the fluids quick. Both of these kits are individually packaged and marked so that all of the supplies you will need are easy to find and easy to use with all supplies included in one package. This OSHA compliance kit meets the 2021 Z308.1-2021 first aid kit requirement for Class B, type II & IV first aid kits. Biohazard clean up kit meets the OSHA bloodborne standard 1910.1030.",
