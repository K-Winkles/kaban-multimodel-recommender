                "reviewText": "Small case, that suits my needs ok. I didn't need yet another complete 1st aid kit, with a bunch of MacGyvers survival items in it, not that it wouldn't come in handy. Considering I have several kits in go bags. I thought of only picking up just the 1st aid case, for a daily carry sling bag that's on the light side. This particular case seemed to be a fitting match for me. It's size and slim profile is what attracted me to, it at just 4.5 X 6 1/4. It fits in my daily carry with no problem, there were a few loose threads throughout and a slight plastic scent when removed from the clear film that eventually went away. No big deal either way. The zipper isn't a YKK - not that I was expecting that for a 5 buck case. But it didn't get stuck when testing it out, so that's good. I pulled specific items from my 1st aid stash that will commonly be used and Wah La! I'm a happy camper, so overall seams are tight, zipper functions as intended, it's relative to my personal needs and it's slim profile that makes it a win win for me. Why only 4 stars, well longevity is always questionable and only time will tell, I paid the full price for this case, my review is based on my experience and my current needs, would I recommend this item? Yes, if it meets your expectations as it did mine. Could you go high end, yes but not at this price point. Let's be real, this case is super inexpensive and it does what it's supposed to do, keep your 1st aid items at hand . If anything changes in the future, I will provide an update. I hope you find this review helpful.",

I really wanted to put the RV Q EpiPen in there that my baby has but they did not fit in there. To fit but the other third one did not. I thought it would be slightly bigger based on the dimensions but I was wrong it seemed a little smaller. I basically bought it because of the dimensions listed. Unfortunately I had to return this because it just did not work for me.",
