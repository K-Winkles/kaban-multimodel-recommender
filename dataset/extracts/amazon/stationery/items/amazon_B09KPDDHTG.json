The lines on paper are far apart so if you tend to write long letters, these may not be for you; but if you just want a quick hello and breifing on what's going on, they are great. Again, big space between lines, but beautiful, the only drawback is that the back of the paper is white. Overall, great for the price and very pretty!",
