                "reviewText": "I paid full price for this item, and I'll definitely buy more.I got the \"I Love You S'More\" pattern. It's really cute, and the colors are true to the product page. The book contains 40 tri-fold sheets and 48 stickers. In case you haven't see this type of thing before, you tear a page from the book, write your letter, fold the paper into roughly thirds along a pre-made crease, and it closes with a sticker. There is a perforation along the top for removing the scrappy end from the spiral. It's hard to see, and younger kids won't be able to remove it, or won't be bothered.I've had a lot of these over the years, both my own as a camper, and then for my kids. This stationery has none of the usual problems.The lines are wide enough for younger kids to write on easily.There's plenty of space to write (my son's stationery has about five lines, which, to be honest, is five lines more than he uses).There aren't pictures covering the writing area, so you can actually read what was written.The sticker is sticky, and actually keeps the trifold closed.There are a LOT of sheets. They typical set has about eight pieces, and costs more than this giant pad. This might last my 9 year old through the rest of her summers at sleepaway camp.NOTE: It takes a standard stamp, the same one you'd use to mail an envelope.I have no complaints about this product. It's a great deal, and I'll certainly buy more for my daughter and my nieces.",

Both my son and daughter wanted to keep the stationary as there own but I said it was mine and I purchased the same type of stationary for them with different designs. The stationary is super easy use, just write, fold and place the sticker on to close, no envelope needed. The quality is excellent and the stickers are super cute; marshmallows, hearts, smores...You can write on several pieces, fold as one letter and use one sticker. I actually put a sticker on the side just in case but I think it would have been fine had I not.Would purchase again.",
