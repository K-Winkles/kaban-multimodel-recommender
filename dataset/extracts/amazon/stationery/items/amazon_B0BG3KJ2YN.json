There are two sizes of paper, one set the size of the envelopes and one set twice the size (so you fold it in half to make it fit in the envelopes.) The box is also amazing because it's more sturdy than cardboard so it's easy to keep everything in the same space. A couple of pens and stamps also fit in the box with the set.The design and colors are all gorgeous. There are stickers as well. The envelopes seal nicely and have the Hallmark logo embossed on the back. I've used these for thank you cards, baptism cards, Valentines cards, and birthday cards because they are blank inside.One thing that bugs me is the paper is exactly the same size as the envelope so it doesn't fit nicely. Because of that, you have to fold the small papers to put them in without ruining them.",

The cards, notepad and stationary sheets are top-notch quality and just beautiful. The envelopes are pink and coordinate perfectly with the floral graphics. And of course the stickers are lovely too & match everything. It's expertly curated so that everything is high quality and goes together perfectly. Exactly what one would expect from Hallmark. I am extremely pleased with this set and think it would make a lovely gift. 100% recommended!",

We could all use the joy of receiving something pretty and thoughtful in the mail. This set includes letter paper, memo paper, envelopes, and stickers, all of good quality, as expected from Hallmark. Considering how much greeting cards cost these days, I think this is a good value.",
