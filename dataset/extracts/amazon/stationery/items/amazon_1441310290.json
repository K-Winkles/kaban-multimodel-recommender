                "reviewText": "These are wonderful! Very subtle artwork on a linen-like matte finish on the front AND back. There is an oh so right frame around the dragonflies. They look expensive. I'm a little particular about paper and ink on personal correspondence looking cheap. It seems as time marches on the things sent in the mail are on nothing special paper and written with a blue ballpoint pen. Horrible! I caught myself getting into the habit of doing that as well, buying cards at Marshalls or a discount store and writing with a ballpoint pen. It doesn't have to be that way when card sets like these from Peter Pauper Press are handly. I also use a uni-ball Signo pen and my notes come out so much nicer, and I am never caught in a pinch. I like to show respect for the people who get my notes and this is a way to get it done. Blank inside is the way to go. The upper inside of the note has an indentation where the artwork was stamped, which matters only if you intend to write on it. You don't get that on note cards which cost $80 a boxl. Also the illustrator is top notch although much of his work is children's books. You will not be sorry for buying these and treat yourself to a pack of these pens while you are at it. They cost $1-2 dollars each and come in other colors, refillable.",

                "reviewText": "I like the simplicity of these cards and the quality is good. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the box had large pieces of tape holding the lid on and they were sloppily applied (uneven and wrinkled). The clear plastic lid fits snuggly inside the box so I'm not sure why the tape was needed. If I was giving this as a gift I would have needed to remove the tape and clean off the sticky residue left behind first. Peter Pauper Press seems to use tape this way on a lot of their products and it just makes the presentation more tacky (no pun intended).",
