The envelopes are nicer than the cards, which is amusing.Like other reviewers, my cards arrived in a damaged box. The lid has a big cut in it, presumably from someone opening a case of these and my box was on top. Thankfully I just wanted the cards and the box is unimportant, but if you're buying these as a gift, make sure you order ahead in case you need a replacement.",

Could be used for thank you, wedding, birthday, sympathy.These are very sturdy as well. Good quality. Classy. The turquoise envelopes make them stand out in the mail.I'm on my second box of these cards. I highly recommend them.",
