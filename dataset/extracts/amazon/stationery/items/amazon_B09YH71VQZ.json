                "reviewText": "These highlighters are the best!! I\u2019ve been looking/trying out different brands of highlighters that would best fit for annotating my books. And these highlighters are the perfect fit!! They don\u2019t bleed through which is a MAJOR plus, dry out quickly, smooth, and cute pastel colors. Guys don\u2019t hesitate to get them, JUST DO IT, they are the best! I can\u2019t wait to highlight all over my book, hehe :)",

All of the colors are gorgeous and they\u2019re all sheer so you can see the writing underneath. I have no problem with the shape, as some others do. These are perfect and high quality! My only gripe is the fact that the colors are not written on the highlighter; they\u2019re only printed on the back of the box. So once you inevitably get them out of order, you have no idea which color is which. So I had to make my best guess of the colors and put labels on them. Other than that, these highlighters are 10/10!",
