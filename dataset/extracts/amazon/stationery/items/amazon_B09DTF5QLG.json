There is no noticeable coating on the paper, so writing with fountain pen or ball pen works well without \"slippery\" spots. Even on printed area.Works well with fountain pen ink without bleeding or feathering (spreading) and ink dries fairly quickly without smudging.One side is printed and the other side is clear. I write on the clear side to avoid bumping into rather printing.Good paper thickness and quality appropriate for letter writing.The box is attractive.Makes a good gift with the box.",
