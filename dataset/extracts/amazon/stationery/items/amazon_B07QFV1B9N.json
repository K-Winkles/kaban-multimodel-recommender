It it didn't legitimately apply to what I was truly looking for, as nowhere in the product description does it even mention \"waterproof\". However I didn't notice. I was excited that print & copy friendly was mentioned, & how pretty it looked. It was also MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE than the alternative waterproof paper and spiral notebooks I viewed & bought at the same time. I needed the best, most versatile writing materials for my upcoming outdoor purpose, so I bought 5 different types of waterproof paper, then tested ~10 writing instruments (pencil, pen, felt pens, Sharpies, etc.) on each. I ran water over everything and compared the results. Still not realizing these sheets were NOT specifically marketed as \"waterproof\", they were by far the most superior!!! (only gel pens, felt pens & some highlighters didn't hold up under water) Only when I went to purchase MORE, check for other colors etc, did I finally realized these water-COLOR sheets had no mention of also being water-PROOF. THEY ARE TRULY AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL, VERSATILE AND HIGH QUALITY. Don't hesitate--- buy them!",

                "reviewText": "The watercolor shows on both sides. Which makes running it through a printer really easy. You do not have to worry about it you have the paper facing the right direction. There were no issues running through our printer. Never jammed. Did not bleed through to the other side. The ink dried quickly and well on the paper. The paper is a good quality. it was used to help create teacher appreciation gifts. We made inspiration jars for 10 teachers and printed out 7 sheets for each jar. There was such a range of colors and patterns, it worked really well. The rainbow of colors inside the jar was exactly what we were needing and going for!",
