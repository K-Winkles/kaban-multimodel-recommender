                "reviewText": "I was a little hesitant to purchase stationery paper from Amazon because I was scared the quality was gonna be terrible. Like, what if it's super thin or the design is blurry like some cheap MS paint printout or something but having been unable to find proper 8.5x11 paper with a nice design anywhere, I decided to take the plunge and bought this.I am so happy I did!! The paper is the best paper I've bought this decade probably! It's not SUPER thick where it's annoying but it's thick enough where my G-2 pilot pens do not show through on the other side. I press down really hard when I write also so the outlines can be felt, but at no part did the ink bleed through.The watercolor on the paper was beautiful, exactly as pictured and it was a quality print, no unintended blurred lines from what I saw. The little hearts and stars on some of the papers look very nice. The design is on both sides so I did write on both sides and it was eligible after I was done writing.Overall, super super happy with the purchase. I've added other designs the same seller is selling and will be buying them also! I did feel a little weird sticking such beautiful paper in a plain white envelope though...Only con is that the packaging was pretty terrible. They throw all the paper in a little thin plastic container ad that container got thrown into a paper bag. I think something heavy was on the packaging because every page had a small crease on the top center of it, but it wasn't noticeable after I filled out the paper.",
