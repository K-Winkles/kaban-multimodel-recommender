                "reviewText": "I'm disappointed in these note cards and wish I had returned them for a refund. First, the cards have a matte finish, and some of the images are blurry. I had expected beautiful, glossy photos. Secondly, the cards are quite small, measuring only 4-5/8\" x 3-3/4\". The envelopes are awkwardly larger than the cards, and they don't go with the cards. The cards have black backgrounds, but the envelopes are trimmed in navy blue with navy blue backs.",

It contains 20 different peony pictures-not just a few photos repeated. They are perfect for Thank you notes. I paid approx. 17.00CDN for them, so they are just under 1.00 each, which is worth it. Happy with this purchase.",
