Most stationary/paper handles your typical writing utensils such as gel pen, marker and ball point inks. Just because paper works well with those inks does not mean it will play nice with fountain pens ink.I attached a photo of different types of inks on this stationary. You can see that all of them worked well, did not feather, bleed or smear. I used two different fountain pen inks with broad wet nibs and this paper handled both inks really well. For that\u2026 I give it 5 stars.The stationary has 6 different designs. The paper and matching envelopes for each design is packed in a sealed bag. The designs and lines are clearly printed. The paper is a good weight and is nice to the touch. I am not sure what else I can share except that I am going to enjoy using this stationary with my favorite fountain pens.",
