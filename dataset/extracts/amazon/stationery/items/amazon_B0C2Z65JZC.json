                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So, I took a chance to buy something with basically no reviews, but it was worth it!Buyers should be aware of 2 things- 1) these envelopes do not have any self sealing feature (not that gross lickable glue stuff, nor a built in sticker on the inside of the envelope) but, they do come with the lovely stickers that match each set. 3 sheets of stickers. I tried out one of the stickers and I do think it could be stronger, but it wasn't useless. To be on the safe side, if you are going to actually mail these envelopes through the postal system, I would put a bit of tape on the envelopes instead of relying solely on the sticker. It would be nice if the seller would give the buyer a heads up that the envelopes aren't self sealing, but it doesn't bother me personally.2nd- the colors of stationary I got are just a little bit different than what's in the photo online, the Amazon photos are very vivid, almost shocking colors on some. But, if you read the details in the description of the product, the seller says clearly there may be slight color differences. The set I've received is slightly more pastel colored, but they are beautiful all the same, and I intend to keep this stationary.The paper is lined on both sides and a bit thin but not bad. Use writing utensils that won't bleed through. The envelopes are made of thicker paper.",

The paper matches well with the envelopes and I'm very proud to have it to use to write to my many pen pals! The only downside is that there are only 50 sheets of paper to go with the fifty envelopes! I tend to do longer letters so I'll use two sheets of paper per envelope! This did not come as a surprise as I read about the paper before ordering it but I liked the paper so much that I ordered it anyway! The 25 extra envelopes will still get used as they are too lovely not to be! I'll order again when ready!",
