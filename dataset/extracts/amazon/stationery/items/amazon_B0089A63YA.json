                "reviewText": "These hand engraved crafted letters are very exquisite. They're just what you're looking for in a minimalist, professional, simple, and yet elegant card. My only wish is that there were more in the pack or a bit cheaper. $19 for 10 is ridiculous. The card is small, so if you're wanting to write a lot in it then this is not the card for you. If you want to simply say thanks and give a brief explanation on why you're thankful then this is a good card. The cards are really nice, I just wish my handwriting was better. It kind of ruins the card if you do not have good penmanship. I have horrid chicken scratch handwriting and wish I would have just typed a letter onto fancy paper. The quality of the letter and envelope is nice, you can tell from the texture. I am giving this 5 stars because I would love to receive a letter like this.",

Although the price point might seem high, around $2 per card, this is a lot less than some of the other high end thank you cards go for, and you are not sacrificing quality with these cards. I have used these cards in situations where I need a professional and eloquent thank you note. The cards themselves are very simple. The paper is very thick and high quality. The envelopes are also very thick and high quality. The design on the interior of the envelopes is not over the top, and it adds a little bit of flare to the note.If you are looking for a thank you card that is really going to impress the recipient, these are for you! You should never underestimate the power of a strong, professional thank you card!",

I previously bought the pale green ecru cards and was disappointed that Crane no longer carries them. These are simple yet elegant. The gold embossing looks better than in the pictures and the detail on the envelope is subtle but classy. The paper is thicker and shows its great quality. I'd highly recommend. Another excellent product from Crane.",

The paper weight is significant along with the decorative lining, these features alone will guarantee that the recipient will know you are sincere with the thank you.I traditionally use gel pens so note that the paper takes time to absorb all the ink. I have noticed that felt markers (sharpies) seem to write the cleanest on these cards.",
