                "reviewText": "I wanted to write a condolence letter and I realized that my personalized stationery is too jaunty and colorful for such a purpose, so I ordered this, which arrived within two days.I'm a left-handed fountain pen user, which means I push the nib across the page. This paper has quite a bit of tooth, so it's not a smooth writing experience for me. That said, the ink doesn't feather or bleed. (I'm using Waterman Serenity Blue in a TWSBI Eco EF.) The paper is thick, and there is very little ghosting. If you hold the paper up to the light, you can see the watermark \"Crane & Co 100% cotton\". On the reverse side, there is no blue edging, but the word \"Crane\" is printed in blue in small letters at the bottom. This bit of branding is not obtrusive and doesn't bother me at all.I printed out some college-ruled paper, went over the lines with a dark pen, added vertical lines with a ruler every 2 cm, and taped it to my desk. With the Crane paper on top, I can see the rulings and this helps keep my writing straight and neat. Since I have a glass desk, I can shine a lamp underneath to make the lines even clearer, but it's not necessary to do so.",
