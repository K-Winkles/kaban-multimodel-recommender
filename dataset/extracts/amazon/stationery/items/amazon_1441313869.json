A very good price for a good quality card the design is nice, crisp and clear.I am old fashioned and enjoy writing letters this is an affordable way for me to continue my support of the United States Postal system instead of writing on plain notebook paper or going to the store for a card all the time. Which is what I was doing and that gets expensive. I will buy these again.I already used one and it was nice and smooth to write on. I placed the rest in my statinary drawer with a lavender sachet.

                "reviewText": "These cards are a much higher quality than I expected. I searched online for a decent music- or piano-themed stationery, and I settled on this one mostly because it was affordable. Then I saw the attached note, and I understood why the quality was finer than I expected. They also come in a nice box with the keyboard printed around the edges.I could do without the cheesy pun on the front, personally. But it was preferable to the incomprehensible music printed on some other cards, and also preferable to the prohibitive price of some other nice music stationery I saw. I would love the keyboard underlay with a Bach autograph on the overlay; I saw some Bach autograph stationery, but it was otherwise boring. I also saw elsewhere some envelopes lined with music printed on fine paper, but it wasn't Bach, and it was $35 for 10 cards. I guess you can't have everything.",

                "reviewText": "These cards are printed on a nice stock, the printed have a slight raised feel like quality embossing. The envelopes have a matching musical keyboard motif which completes the set. They are great all purpose notes from a musician or music lover. As a musician, I frequently send thank you notes or encouragement notes and these are perfect for that purpose! I will likely buy more in the future.",
