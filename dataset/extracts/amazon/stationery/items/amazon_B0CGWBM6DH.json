He loves video gaming so I thought this would be a great way to encourage his writing along with one of his favorite hobbies.As he was taking everything out of the box, he was excited about each piece (although a little perturbed by the fact that some of the envelopes were stuck together).This is a fun kit to encourage writing and writing of thank yous and other letters for friends and family.",

                "reviewText": "This stationery set has everything you need to write cards & letters, down to the pen. A couple notes:-The envelopes are made of thick cardstock and do not have adhesive. I used the included washi tape to seal them. It sticks well, but I'd recommend putting an X on the envelope flap since the card slightly lifts the washi tape (see photo). Also run your finger along the crease of the envelope flap to ensure it is creased well and stays down.-The pen is a black fine gel pen. It writes well, but has a little rattle and takes a long time to dry on the inside of the heart cards, and even longer on the outside of the envelopes. Lefties should be careful when writing on the cards so they don't smear their writing, but should be ok on the paper.-The lanyard and card holder themselves aren't decorative but comes with a \"VIP card\" you can add. There's a window on each side. You gently pry apart the top, then can slip the card or information in the clear sleeve for protection. It stays shut pretty well on its own but the white lanyard clip holds it together for extra security.There are lots of other pieces to this set that are fun for letter writing & decorating. I would recommend this set for the gamer in your life, though you may want a ballpoint pen to use with the cards and envelopes since it will dry a lot more quickly than the included gel pen.",
