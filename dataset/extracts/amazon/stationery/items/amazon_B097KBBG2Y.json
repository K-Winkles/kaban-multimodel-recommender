                "reviewText": "I just opened the package. Must say it's a lot of writing paper and envelopes for the $$. The letter sheets are small - seems like 5 x 7.. some sheets are 5 1/2 x 8. Some envelopes are pre-creased, some not. None have adhesive glue, so better find some scotch tape or stickers. The writing stock is nice and heavy, but the envelopes are somewhat flimsy. I hope they don't tear when I stuff a two page letter into them. The larger sheets also come with bigger envelopes. Each pattern is very cute - I'm especially partial to the roses and floral prints in general. Was hoping those would be good to write to my Granddaughter, while the other prints, appearing more masculine, to my Grandson. However, one set says \"I'm in love with you\" - kind of strange. Another has a printed message \"do what you love\" which is more neutral. Only those two sets, luckily, have messages. One set has a ladybug wearing a witches' hat - weird but amusing. Don't know what the artist was thinking ... Each design is separately prepackaged in its own cellophane bag - the entire set is nicely packaged. The pastel envelopes with corresponding floral writing paper, are lined with the cute matching floral print. In conclusion, as my Mom used to say, you get what you pay for. I'd say this set is more quantity than quality, but, in general, is very cute and appropriate for kids to use, or adults to correspond with them. Overall, worth the $$.",
