                "reviewText": "Since letter writing paper is apparently no longer sold in stores, I'm always on the lookout for stationery. This set comes with several different cute designs and matching envelopes. Each set comes in its own plastic envelope. Unfortunately for my purposes (writing multi-page letters), nearly all of the paper sheets in this set have busy designs on the back, making it impossible to write on the back of the page. The designs are very cute, just not practical if you're planning to write very much. Also, for some reason, the envelopes have no adhesive on the flap. You will need to use some tape or glue to seal the letters shut. The envelopes are quite small, so that the paper must be folded in thirds (rather than just once in the center) in order to fit. Since stationery is so hard to find these days, this set is a nice one to use, but there are a few drawbacks to consider if you want to write long letters or send any enclosures.",

The envelopes do not have adhesive attached, but double-sided tape is included.The paper seems high-quality (maybe 25 lb?), and the printing is as pictured. If I ever need stationary again, I\u2019ll rebuy this one.Tips for the tape:- Remove the thin, long strip on the end- Remove one of the tape strips. Sometimes I had to rip it off quickly to prevent the tape from ripping.- Fold two corners along the long edge so that the tape sticks to itself, and then unfold the paper covering. This will leave 2 triangle pieces of glue on the strip.- Stick the tape on the envelope, just under the center part of the bottom of the envelope.- Remove the paper and place the envelope flap on the exposed tape.",
