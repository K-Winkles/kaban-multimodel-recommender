The roller must be off a bit, as the line is not straight, and a random heart center will glob up with ink. I tried using a toothpick to clear out what was in the center of one of the hearts, but it made no difference. Would prefer they all \u201cglob\u201d, or \u201cdo not glob\u201d. It isn\u2019t exactly as pictured, which sucks, because the heart one is the main reason I purchased these!**UPDATE to REVIEW** I contacted Aechy customer service, and they immediately sent me out a full replacement pack of pens\u2026 expedited delivery, with no hassle or fuss. The pens in the replacement pack all work perfectly! VERY impressed with their customer service\u2026Harold was great!",

I packaged them up and mailed them, but they never arrived. Tracking shows they are sitting in Poland. (Not sent through Amazon.) I'm so sad about this. Say a little prayer for my friend and her family, will you? And put in a good word for having the package get to her, OK?",

It seems the design doesn't permit for a straight line. You'll need to use a ruler and then the design of the pen tip with the actual liner doesn't always fit well against a ruler. It doesn't work well but would be great for children to color with.",

So u have to make sure that the wheel itself is straight before drawing the line. Y\u2019all are just pressing on it as u wish\u2026the wheel doesn\u2019t rotate\u2026so when you try to drag it when the wheel is not straight it goes either up or down in the direction of the wheel . As you can see, the heart snd flower stamps are a bit patchy but not as bad as the others have shown\u2026it\u2019s because the Ink is not being distributed properly when u drag the wheel in the wrong direction. Also, press lightly vs pressing harder the designs come out crisper. Hope this helps someone!",
