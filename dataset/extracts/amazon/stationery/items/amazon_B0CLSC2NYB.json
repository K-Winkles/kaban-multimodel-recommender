                "reviewText": "There are times that a store-bought card or email note just isn't right. So it's times like that when a handwritten (or typed!) note on some nice stationary adds that personal touch that gets noticed. Sad to say, this sort of thing is a dying art.But for old throwback boomers like yours truly, who learned cursive in the 3rd grade, having some stationary on hand is a good thing. For the price, this is a nice set. Not super duper classy and elegant but nice. There are enough sheets for an average of two pages per envelope. The color and border are not overwhelming.Only issue, and I guess at this price it shouldn't be an issue, is the paper itself. As other reviewers have noted (and I concur), the icing on the cake would have been even a slight texture to the paper. Nothing too aggressive since some folks may want to run it through a printer. But more than the smooth \"copy paper\" stock.",

The sheets are the perfect size--not printer paper size but larger than memo size. I found that I can lay a sheet on top of a lined pad of paper and the stationery is just the right weight that I can see the lines beneath and keep my writing straight. :-) The envelopes are a little bit heavier and look very classy. [NOTE: some pictures on the product page make it appear that the gummed side of the envelope is orange--it is not.] VERY inexpensive for the set. The set arrived in perfect condition which is a plus--no creases or bent pieces. I wish I had the option to purchase with different color borders. Recommend!",

Both the envelopes and paper are heavy paper, an indication of good quality. Although basic, I like the appealing look of the border style. Certainly, it's a versatile stationery that could meet business or personal correspondence requirements. I had forgotten the true size of a standard writing kit that I and many others have been accustomed to growing up. This nice set has been a good reminder of conformity to business standards. I think anyone receiving a letter/note from written on this elegant traditional paper would be impressed.",
