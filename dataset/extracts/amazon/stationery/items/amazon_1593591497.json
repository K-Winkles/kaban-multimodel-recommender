Love the multi-colored sparkles -- they're not over-done and are tasteful. It comes with one extra envelope, which is appreciated. I do agree with other reviews though -- the product is beautiful, but the box cover is unbelievably flimsy, which detracts from the quality of the note card. If the manufacturer would change the cover (the bottom is solid and very well constructed), it would make this product even better.",
