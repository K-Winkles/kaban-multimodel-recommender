                "reviewText": "I've been buying stationery sets from Peter Pauper Press for many months now and love the various designs, having bought several of them. I rotate amongst my 4 favorites, this being one of them. The paper is a good size and the sets come with coordinating envelopes. My only negative comment is that there is not enough paper for my type of letter writing. Each set comes with 30 sheets of paper and 24 envelopes. I typically use between 3-5 sheets for each daily letter so I am accumulating quite a surplus of envelopes. Wish it were possible to buy the paper alone on occasion to allow me to use up some of them. The boxes that the sets come in are great, too. I keep them when the paper is gone and have made a holder (similar to a small dresser) where the boxes serve as \"drawers\" to keep pens, stamps, etc. organized.",
