While it is thick, I was also able to put it on a legal pad and see through enough to follow the lines for my writing. I use a fountain pen and the inks I have tried have not bled through. I could write on both sides if I chose to.The complaint about the Crane logo is overblown. It appears on one side of each sheet of paper at the bottom in a light color and small font. I doubt I would have noticed except I was concerned and looking for it after reading the comment in a recent review. It is very unobtrusive, don't worry.",

                "reviewText": "While admitting that this is a first-world problem, I almost returned this box of stationery! I have used Crane for decades because of its elegance and quality. It was unquestionably 5-star quality and remains so. Even when I couldn't really afford it, I would buy the smallest package and use it only for very special occasions. A truly high quality product doesn't call attention to itself. Clothes with designer names on them look cheap, and say \"Hey, look at me. I'm advertising ----.\" I am distressed that Crane & Co. now seems to want me do the same. I won't send this box back, but I will try to find a different high quality stationery for future use. I'll probably use this box a little more freely, just to be able to move on. I hope that by adding this review to the chorus of others with the same complaint, Crane & Co. will be moved to reconsider this marketing strategy. Even better, maybe they will see that there is a market for people who love their stationery, but without their name on every sheet.",
