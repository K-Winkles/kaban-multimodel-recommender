I would say its about 20 to 22 lb. thickness. I used it with a fineliner pen and the ink does not bleed to the back side, which is also lined and has the airmail borders. I tested alcohol markers on it, and the ink shows on the back. For the envelopes I would be concerned if you live in a humid area, as they can seal while in storage. Overall, I love them so far, I'll update if I see any concerns.",

This is a retro style that looks great and is more neutral than many of the more elaborate and more feminine styles we\u2019d seen. Envelopes are letter size, and paper is printed on both sides. Great for any kind of on-going correspondence. Perfect for someone in the military or heading off to college.",

For someone like me who loves retro / vintage and needs more than 2 pages for my letters, i found this set and was instantly in love. They give you not just 50 sheets, but 50 envelopes! On top of that, the paper size is BIGGER than standard, or some of these \"extra small cute sized\" sets. And to add to that, the paper is nice to write on \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
