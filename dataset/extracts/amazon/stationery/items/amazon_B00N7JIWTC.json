I purchased 5 packages.I *love* ginkgo leaves and the engraving on the card is just beautiful. It's gold, very detailed and is the right scale for the card. The ecru card color really sets it off. The card is heavy weight. I write my notes with a fountain pen and my left hand. The paper quickly absorbs the ink and it does not bleed to the other side.The price is a little steep but it's in line with the rest of Crane's stock.",
