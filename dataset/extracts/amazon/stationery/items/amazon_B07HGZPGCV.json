I Adore how it All looks just as they're described, and Yes the print,color, paper and matching envelopes all look just like the photos show. The Perfectly matched envelopes come with a pre glue strip on them. The sizes all hold true to their descriptioniveness, not as big as a full size computer sheet of paper, but they're honestly not much smaller than that at all. They're much bigger than just a typical 5'7 or smaller sized stationary sheet. The paper is really soft and smooth,making writing / drawing on them very easy. Theyre isn't anything I can Honestly say that I don't like about any of the stationary I ordered. They're not see through. And the print on the backside ties in with the way it looks on the front side. They don't look, feel or sound cheap\u2713\u2713\u2713. The quality and quantity are both worth the money in my personal opinion. And so far its met all of my expectations. Pretty stationary writing paper\u2713 Beautiful picture and colors\u2713\u2713 Sturdiness and Decent Quality/Quantity\u2713\u2713 Really nice Quality*And Worth the money\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713I'd definitely, Definitely highly recommend this to anyone looking for pretty stationary. I can't justify an opinion as to if theyll fit in standard sized printers or if things print out centered or evenily on them or not,bcus I don't have one to try them in, but I also didn't necessarily or solely buy it for that purpose alone. I more bought them so I could get back into writing again like I once used to do. To write my children,family or friends like I once did years&years ago. Or even get back into writing poetry like I once did. Again I can't express truly enough with how pleased or how tickled pink I am with finally picking out this perticular stationary pack. I completely and absolutely adore my entire Amazon order in general as a whole, after hours and days of researching what I was looking for, I found exactly what I was looking for, it really is all that I was hoping it'd be. I'm quite pleased , and extremely happy with everything I bought this time. Especially all my new Pretty stationary variety options I now have here at home to pick from anytime I decide I wanna sit and jus' write.",

It's a great gift idea and all of my pen pals will be receiving a set. Any pre-teen or teenage girl would love it, as well. The intricate details on the designs are breath takingly beautiful and you can even write on the back of the paper because the design includes all that space! The envelopes are tall, instead of long, and offers lovely authenticity. I simply LOVE it and I think you will, too. : )",

                "reviewText": "I have a project for one of my classes where I needed to write several letters to residents at a homeless shelter. I went to three stores looking for stationery, but all I could find were cards, or very small paper for writing notes. I read the reviews on this paper before buying it, and there really was no need. This paper is beautiful! I ran them through my printer to add lines, because I cannot write straight to save my life. I used Tul brand ink pens to write my letters, and was pleasantly surprised that they did not bleed through the paper at all! The paper came packaged nicely, with each design and their matching envelopes in their own packaging. I will be buying more soon!",

                "reviewText": "This stationery is beautiful, and has color on both sides. The front has more design, but the back also has a little of the design. As you can see in the pictures, I used a calligraphy marker, which is very dark, and it didn't show through to the other side. The envelope opens from the short side instead of the long side, which makes it look a little weird when writing the address the regular way, parallel with the long side of the envelope. I would buy this stationery again. Lovely designs, 6 different designs/colors, and good quality.",

The letters are always very well received and make the recipients smile, in part because of how beautiful the paper is. The colour tones are fantastic and the nature/floral type designs are really eye catching. I love the Japanese feel to some of them especially. The paper is really good quality, easy to write on and the matching envelopes are stunning and premium feeling.I was in love with these on first impression and 2 years later, I still am!Highly recommended!",
