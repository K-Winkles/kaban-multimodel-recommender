It Would Be Nice if All The Envelopes Were In One Bag, Paper In One Bag, Charms & Cord In One Bag. Or Even Paper & Envelopes In One Bag. There Is to Much Waste In Packaging When Not Needed. ( I conserve where I can for ecosystem )I am going to mail most of mine, so everyone, keep in mind that the cord can not be on the outside lol! So, wanting to keep the vintage charm of it all, all you have to do is put the twine and charm on the note paper instead. Fold it in half and wrap like you would on the envelope :) Still Cute!NOTE: I am very familiar with the postal service, if you do send it via usps, make sure to put clear tape on outside of envelope of all contact points of charm area to prevent poking through during automated sorting machines!..",

I love the overall look and vibe.. they would go perfect with wax seals if so inclined.. this is definitely fun stationary and really is as expected and how the pictures look.Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - the lack of design on the back and they are also difficult to write on. The design side has a bit more of what I would call a waxy like feel to it. I was using a ball point pen and I couldn\u2019t really see what I was writing on the design side. A gel pen would have been much better. The back side - no issues with the ink showing on it.",
