It has plenty of room for power cords, my phone, wireless earbuds, and any other smaller items that I will be taking for the cruise to keep everything together, and to pop into my carry on luggage. I also thought about using it for sewing supplies such as scissors, small pincushion, rotary cutter and other sewing supplies. Another use I envisioned is a makeup case. A lot of room for what I need when I travel. So I guess what I am trying to say is, this case can be used for many uses!",
