Sheets fit the envelopes as expected. I can\u2019t speak to the adhesion yet. You do have to wet the envelope to seal it.I\u2019m uploading photos that hopefully will help with size reference. They include a regular file folder and #10 envelope and the standard letter stationery so you can get a better idea of the size.",

                "reviewText": "I just received my stationery , cute floral, I was hesitant at first because it is so reasonably priced, but it is lovely. Envelopes to match, double sided, just large enough for a nice note to someone. They come individually wrapped with a plastic that can be resealed if you so choose. I am older and need the lines to keep my writing straight, so these were perfect. I will be ordering more.",

                "reviewText": "They are pretty, and cheap, but the envelopes are poor quality. They look nice, but the adhesive is basically non existent. The worst part is - they are not sized correctly. Folding the letter in half will NOT fit inside the card - it\u2019s about 2 mm too long. You must tri-fold your letter to get it to fit. It\u2019s a fairly obvious design error that it misses fitting a half fold by such a small amount.If the envelope was of better quality and fit, this would be a 5 star product. As it is now, it just looks pretty but requires creativity to make it work.",
