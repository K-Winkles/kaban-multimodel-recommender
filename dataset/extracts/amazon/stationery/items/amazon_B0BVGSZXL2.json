It is definitely a blast from the past\u2026I really like the aged/vintage look, and the stationary paper is quite substantial. It is 27 lb. bond paper, which is definitely on the thick side. It should be noted that this stationary paper is not bright white. Rather, it is a light tan colored, which is exactly what you would expect vintage paper to look like. I like it very much.Here is the best part\u2026 This vintage stationary will REALLY get someone\u2019s attention! No kidding! For the price of one US Postal Service First Class Mail stamp, you are almost guaranteed that the recipient will QUICKLY open this important looking envelope.Summary: I am very pleased with this vintage looking stationary. I rate it 5 Stars. Buy it.",
