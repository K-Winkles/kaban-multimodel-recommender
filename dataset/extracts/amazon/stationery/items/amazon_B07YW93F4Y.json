                "reviewText": "I purchased this stationary over a year ago, along with a couple of other types, to write physical letters to my daughter currently serving in the Navy. I simply love this stationary - the look-and-feel, paper weight, design, and envelop adhesion are all top-notch. I love writing letters on these!Now for the caveat -- I had been sending these to my daughter just fine until a couple of months ago when the USPS started sending them back to me. It turns out that the envelopes are technically shorter than the minimum allowed height for mailing envelopes per the USPS mailing manuals (I think that they are about 1/4\" too short - I don't recall the exact measurement that took). The USPS used to handle them but recently they started returning them to me, causing me to have to put the envelope inside a different (I used #10 standard) envelope to get it to go through the mail.The measurements are close enough that it might slip through and get handled by the USPS, but they've been cracking down recently and mine are getting returned now so keep that in mind when buying. (I hope that the manufacturer sees this review and can adjust their envelope size slightly since I really do love this stationary set!)",

I used various ink colors while writing to him, all of which were legible even through the designs.The only con I would say to the purchase is because it is smaller than the standard envelope, it seemed to take longer in snail mail transit than by using a standard #10 envelope.",
