Yes, it is quality paper especially at this price point. Will it handle different ink types? Yes, I used the top sheet displayed inside the see through lid to test ink types and colors. It wrote well with a ballpoint as well as different size roller gel pens. I chose the gel and it dried without smearing as it tends to do on cheap paper. Is the pattern embossed? Just a little, it has very thin silver lines in the flowers. Pretty, pretty paper!It is really nice and I know it will be a nice addition to my stationery supplies.",

The paper itself is of a nice weight and overall is well made. Finding stationery where I live is next to impossible - the stores only carry note card sets. There are times when I like to share news that will take more space than a note card will allow, hence my search for stationery sets. I just wish it included more pages for the amount of envelopes included.",

                "reviewText": "This beautiful stationery has become my signature letter paper. I\u2019m on my second box this year and plan to buy more. It\u2019s so pretty and the paper is a substantial, heavy weight that just soaks up the ink nicely so it doesn\u2019t run and bleed everywhere. I love to write letters and it\u2019s lovely to find pretty paper to keep this dying art alive with my close friends and family. They say they know it\u2019s from me immediately by the distinctive paper even before they see the return address. I love that. Some have complained the design takes up too much space, where as I feel that\u2019s why there is double the amount of paper than average boxes - so you can use two written pages and still appreciate the beautiful design. It\u2019s stationery. It\u2019s meant to be used up! Write lots of letters :)",

                "reviewText": "This paper is lovely - beautiful delicate design. and the price is right! I am so pleased to have found Peter Pauper Stationery and will order more. The texture and size is excellent for short personal computer letters - front and back using the program \"Word\" and Paper Size 5 \"x 7\" . I set the top margin at 0.15\" and the other 3 margins at 0.5\" and get approximately 3/4\" margins all around on this 5 3/4\" x 7 3/4\" paper. I also suggest setting the font size of 12 in italics to make the letter look personal. I am now 94 years old and my handwriting has deteriorated so prefer to write personal correspondence using the computer. I hope this helps others who wish to use this paper.With best wishes and many many thanksMoira Breenmoirasbreen@sbcglobal.net",
