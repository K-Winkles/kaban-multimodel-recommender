The colour effect is also printed on both sides, unlike some vintage papers that I've seen which is white on one side.There are 6 sheets of paper in each design and 48 envelopes in the 6 designs, so 96 pieces in total.Good quality and worth the money. I would definitely buy again. (The photo shows a folded piece that was sent to me as a letter. The paper actually comes flat.)",
