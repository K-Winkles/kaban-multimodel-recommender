I was looking for something blank that I could send to people I care about for whatever occasion I deem them suitable (graduation, life event, first day of college, death in the family, etc.) They are simple, elegant, and affordable. Make sure you understand the dimensions before you buy because these are the on \"small side\" but I knew that before purchasing and I'm fine with that. They also include a nice gold painted thick cardboard box with clear plexiglass lid for storing them in, that is nice as well!It is difficult to see from the photos but as others have pointed out, the tree is beautiful. The leaves are a shimmery purple, the trunk and roots a nice brown, and there are thin golden lines woven throughout the tree, accenting it nicely.I like how they also provide you with an extra envelope, nice touch!I will buy again, certainly when they are only $.45/card!",

                "reviewText": "I love the simple and classy design of this tree and purchased these so my husband and son would have more masculine cards to write thank you notes. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because this company seems to have a thing about using tape on the boxes when it isn't necessary and is sloppily done with the tape applied crooked and wrinkled. The clear plastic lid fits snuggly inside the box so tape isn't necessary. If I was giving this as a gift I'd feel a need to remove the tape and residue it leaves behind first.",
