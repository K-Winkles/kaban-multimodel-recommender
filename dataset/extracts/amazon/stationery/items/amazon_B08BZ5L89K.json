Stationery is important to me and finding just the right kind to express myself is quite a job. When I saw this stationery, I knew it was for me. And, upon receiving it, I was not disappointed. It is well made, very pretty, easy to write on and the matching envelopes are a dream. You will love this product! It's perfect!",

These open on a short end which I like for its uniqueness. Also included is a small sheet of 3M stickers to seal the envelopes closed. The thickness is good. I've only used one type of pen with it at the moment, iBayam fineliner pen which has water-based ink. I didn't see any bleedthrough with this pen. I'm going to enjoy writing letters to others in this pretty stationery. Would recommend you purchasing it also if you like to write letters. I feel like it was a good value for $9.99.
