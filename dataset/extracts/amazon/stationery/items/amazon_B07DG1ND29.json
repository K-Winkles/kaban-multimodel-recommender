As described and matches the photos well.This review is very long, but I have many good things to say about this product, that are specific.The video part of this review, I am mostly repeating a bunch of stuff that I\u2019ve included here.\u2022 perfect weight/thickness of the quality paper, my gel ink pens glide across it, just right, & the paper doesn\u2019t easily smear, etc.\u2022 the box is a piece of art onto itself, & looks cute among my other stationary items\u2022 includes envelopes of 4 different colors, to match with the cards, or mix them up, both look good\u2022 One feature I also enjoy, that these cards are square.\u2022 I am impressed all around, & will definitely buy from Papyrus again\u2022 I also purchased (at the same time) a fancier card, sold solo, of the branch of a cherry blossom tree, hanging above water, from the same brand, Papyrus. It has a couple of 3-D features.\u2022 I appreciate that Papyrus has different price points for different items, as all are beautiful and good (quality) choices, for differing occasions. Their price point for these note cards is reasonable and a good deal. I did not expect the cards to be so vibrant.\u2022 wrapped and shipped appropriately (SUPER fast) to avoid damage, this is an item that I would feel comfortable gifting to someone, directly through Amazon.Lastly, a shout out to this old(er) version of (non-digital) communication.I started writing more letters and cards a few years ago (first, to my beloved grandmother, who has always loved cards) & I have found that I, too, enjoy then.In addition to the video, I am including a couple of pics so that you can see the colored envelopes, & the contrasting lining.",

A nice touch to have gold embossed hummingbird sticker to seal. I found myself staring at the watercolr work of the bird and flowers. I'm not great about reading reviews before a purchase, so it was VERY REFRESHING to order something from Amazon and find was bigger and better than I had imagined. (GIFT IDEA: Coupled with a book of stamps, this would be an excellent gift for friend, neighbor, or co-worker who has lost a loved one.)",
