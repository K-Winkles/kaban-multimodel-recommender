                "reviewText": "First what I like about this pencil. What I like is that I don't have to keep sharpening or clicking to put more graphite out. I write kind of hard and tend to break mechanical pencil graphite. I also like that you can get replacements tips.So what I don't like... Well I don't like how thin it is but that can be fixed easily with a slip on pencil grip. It does write a little light compared to a regular graphite pencil but it is still perfectly legible. I don't like that it doesn't come with an eraser. Erasers are so cheap why not throw one in with a $15 pencil? And lastly I don't like that my point broke off because it slid right off my clip board and landed point first on a concrete floor. Please add some kind of clip to better secure the pencil. And also why are the replacement tips just as expensive as a new pencil?Conclusion, if you are going to use this at a desk or draft table with little risk of dropping on a hard floor then go for it. If you work out in harsher conditions like I do then it might not be the best choice.",

Then the cup I keep pens etc. in on my desk fell, and the whole tip broke off. Would not recommend.",
