One small detail is that when you write over the flowers near the top or bottom of the page, its hard to read, so you have to write around it. It's not that big of an issue, just something small I noticed. The paper is decently thick too so when you write in dark ink, it doesn't bleed through to the next page, which is nice because I try to fill up all areas of the paper. I will definitely be getting more of these when I run out!",

So I had to make adjustments to my printer \ud83d\udda8 to fit the short and narrower size. It was also a pain trying to get the printing area correct and nice.What I liked about it is all of the various stationary sets are very beautiful. It\u2019s probably best used for hand written notes, which I seldom hand write.In short, I would recommend this stationary for hand written letters.",

                "reviewText": "I was very pleased when I received this stationery. The paper and matching envelopes are in plastic bags by individual print/colour. The envelopes are a big strange since you put the paper in them from the side instead of the top but this does not detract from their beauty at all. You can write a letter on both printed sides of each sheet without worrying about your writing bleeding through. I wrote two letters already with a gel pen and was able to write on both sides. I don't think I've ever seen stationery that was printed on both sides! I will most definitely order more when I run low. I love letter writing. It seems to be a lost art today but I will do my part to keep it alive and I will use this stationery set to help me do it!",
