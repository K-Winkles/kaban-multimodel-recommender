I didn\u2019t want 8 1/2 x 11, office paper, because that\u2019s not really appropriate for hand written letters to a friend or family member. So I purchased some nice Monarch-sized paper and envelopes and this boxed stationery set. The gold embossed butterfly at the top is pretty and understated, which is exactly what I wanted. The paper and envelopes have a nice weight and finish, and the ink from my pen glides nicely across it. The stationery is nicely packaged and you get a fair amount for the price.",

                "reviewText": "This was a very satisfying purchase, and I am likely to repurchase it as soon as I run out.The paper was sufficiently think, and the ink did not run or blot on it. The butterfly engraving added a very nice touch to the letter, as it kept the page from being blank aside from text while not drawing unnecessary attention to itself.I was also very pleased with the paper to envelope ratio, as most letters (in my experience) do not require more than one sheet of paper, and, as it was 30 sheets to 24 envelopes, I find that I am not running out of one much faster than the other. This is quite a relief, as in many previous purchases I have found myself unsure of how to use leftover sheets of paper.The cost was by far the greatest attraction to this paper. Many other Amazon sellers (*cough**cough* Crane & Co. *cough*) offer half the amount of stationery at double the price, and the difference in quality is hardly ever visible.The only issue I have with this product is the back of the envelope. The adhesive flap goes horizontally across, instead of coming down from the top corners and meeting in the middle. I prefer to seal my letters with wax, and the end result looks more appealing in the latter situation. However, this is purely a personal issue, and, as the back of the envelopes were shown on the pictures given, I cannot really complain about this minor fault.All in all, I am so glad to have found this stationary and seller, as the quality and cost of this product are unbelievably tantalizing.",
