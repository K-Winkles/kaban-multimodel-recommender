You get two of each design and two sheets of tiny paper per tiny envelope. They have strange writing on them (kinda odd) but if you can see past that, they are really cute. If you want to mail them in the snail mail, you\u2019re going to need to put them into a larger envelope because there is no room to write addresses and things on the envelopes. But they are great!

The only thing I will mention about them is they don\u2019t have any sticky stuff on the envelopes, and some of them needed an address label because the pattern was dark and made it difficult to read the label.
