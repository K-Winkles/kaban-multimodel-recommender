It is the perfect size to tuck away, yet nice enough to keep on display. I love the half-pocket file folders, which are the perfect size for corralling receipts & coupons. I have several Savor Keepsake boxes and have given many as gifts; I am excited to add this to my collection! I have yet to be disappointed in Savor\u2019s product quality, & their customer service is wonderful to work with. Well done, Savor, and thank you!",

My desk has more desktop space than drawer space so I put the Vault on top of my desk and am using it as a sort of second desk drawer with more organization than a typical desk drawer, for checkbooks, stamps, keys, paperclips, and cards I bought but haven\u2019t sent. Love being more organized and the classic styling helps so it can be displayed.",
