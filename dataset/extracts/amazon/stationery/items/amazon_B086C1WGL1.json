                "reviewText": "It is very difficult to find attractive stationery these days, so I was happy to find this set. The paper and envelopes are all made of sturdy paper that will hold up well to both ink/markers and postal service handling (I hope!). I was surprised to see that the envelopes close with a small flap at one end, rather than the traditional flap across the long end of the envelope. That's not a problem, just a different feature. The paper has a pretty, lined design on one side and the other side is blank. The envelopes do have adhesive on the flap, so they will be easy to seal without having to resort to a glue stick or tape (oddly, not always a given these days). I can recommend this beautiful set if you are looking for nice stationery for handwriting your letters.",

                "reviewText": "Colors and pattern were true to the pictures. Paper feels nice and is a decent thickness; the lines are pronounced enough to see, but shaded such that they don't detract from the decorative features of the paper. The only thing I found odd was the closure on the envelopes; instead of the standard triangular closure, they have a little, bitty flap on the short side. It seemed to seal fine, though; I sent a letter out yesterday, so I can't say yet how well it will hold up to shipping. If I were planning to send much more than a couple of sheets, I would probably want to reinforce the closure with some tape, but that's not really a detriment to the product. All in all, it is quite attractive and I am very pleased.",

I love the bright colors and the paper isn't flimsy at all, it has some stiffness to them. The only drawback (for me) is that I like narrower lines, which is college ruled. But overall, I highly recommend this stationary paper.",
