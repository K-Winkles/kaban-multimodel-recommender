Sure, texting is convenient and quick but we lose so much. So, in giving out gifts to my friends' young children, I decided to give a handwritten note along with a silver dollar to each of them. (Yes, a note reflecting on the previous year and a good old-fashioned silver dollar. I *AM* only 40 years old!)Well, this paper is beautiful. It's not something I would necessarily send through the mail, but it's fine for giving in person. I also bought a nice wax seal kit to give it another special touch. The paper itself is soft and textured, and the artistic flare is beautiful. I was concerned that the liquid ink pens I prefer would bleed right through the soft paper, but there was no bleed at all! Soft, elegant, beautiful, and durable, I expect these notes to still be in great condition when the kids read the notes in 20 years! Here's hoping they cherish the thought for a moment before tossing the note in the trash and pawning the silver dollar for cash! :) Whatever they do with the gifts is their business but I am thrilled with the artifact I was able to share.",

The only drawback is that the envelopes don\u2019t have any sealant but that\u2019s not a problem for me. There\u2019s no reason to seal them unless you\u2019re mailing them. There is always the option to tuck the flap inside or get wax and a personalized stamp for the wax when either gifting in person or including within a gift when mailing.",

The responses from friends who received them is pure delight!",

Box is perfect to set anywhere to display. Envelopes are thin yet perfectly sized, same as notes. No cop out other fill ins or junk mixed in to bump the quantity. Each piece is lovely. Only slight negative is pricing is almost out of reach for me, but hopefully it goes to the crafters in a decent percentage. I missed good old fashioned letter writing though my handwriting is nothing to write home about. (Get it->yawn<) This unusual paper will hopefully overcome my feeble attempts at glorious penmanship. Not super thin like the tissue, but thin, to be used gently. Ok for couples, or anyone, not too frilly- just natural, with petals, leaves and fibers. Delivery was prompt and well packaged.",
