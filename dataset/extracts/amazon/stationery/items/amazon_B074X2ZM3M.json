I am a Pilot G2 pen kind of person, and for this paper I use a different pen because the ink will smear. This paper is more of a paper/felt tip/ball point pen paper.2. The paper itself is a nice small/medium size. If you have a lot to write, maybe use a bigger piece of paper.3. There isn\u2019t a way on the envelopes to seal them-no peel off sticker and no where to lick the envelope shut. I\u2019ve been using tape.Other than that, I think these were a lovely purchase.",
