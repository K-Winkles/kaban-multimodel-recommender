It is wider than the envelopes, so you can quarter the paper and fit in the envelopes, but it is far from an ideal fit. Unfortunately, you cannot simply fold the paper once or twice the long way to fit it like with typical stationery. That was a disappointment even though the paper and envelopes are beautiful.I'm updating my review (which was originally two stars) because the seller contacted me and offered a refund since I disliked the product. Good customer service, and I am not out anything because of my purchase.",

It's vintage paper so it's meant to be folded as vintage paper was. Not in the typical way of folding done today but in the vintage style.. see photos. There wouldn't have been adhesive but a wax seal and stamp would be used.. see photos.This is a nice paper but a bit on the thin side for dip ink pens. Regardless it's beautiful and I'll enjoy using it!Hope the photos help!",

                "reviewText": "Yes, Asian envelopes generally do not come pre-glued. But I differ from other reviewers in my opinion of what to do about it; maybe people in the US should just invest in a 25-cent school glue stick instead of trying to change how a whole other continent likes their envelopes? I personally do not understand how the west clings so desperately to our horrifically nasty and unhygienic lickable envelope glue. I mean vs. the cheap glue stick what's even the selling point? You can get a nice papercut on your tongue and send your penpal some saliva while you're at it, yay? And, again, vs. a 25-cent glue stick, what do you suppose the production cost would be to add glue... and then ship it here from Asia? I'd rather glue it myself: it's easy enough my 5 year old could do it anyway.Okay so I read the reviews before buying and I noticed the comments about the glueless envelopes, which you could probably tell I'm a-ok with. And the ones about the papers and envelopes not matching in size. I read that and thought, well come on there has to be SOME logical way to fold it to fit or they wouldn't have made it that way, right? Yeah nope. It's completely the wrong size and there's really no plain way to fold it to fit. In quarters it's way too small in the envelope like a chunky rectangular lump in the middle, and in half it's much too big to even imagine it fitting. The way the designs are along the sides/corners it doesn't make sense to trim the paper to fit either as you'd wind up losing a good amount of the design. Now you CAN fit the papers in greeting card envelopes, which you can get a big box of probably anywhere, however then you're not using the pretty matching envelopes and what DO you use the envelopes for since they don't seem like they'd match anything else... hmmm.The papers themselves are huge. When I saw the measurements in the description I thought that they seemed unusually large, about double the normal size of handwriting letter stationery, but the way the patterns are it's not like you could take advantage of that by cutting each sheet in two. When they arrived and I held them in my hands I realized I wasn't just overthinking it; they are indeed huge. They are about the size of the lid of a shoebox for a child's shoes!The paper seems to be sturdy and not some cheap thin junk, so that's good. The colors however are very off! The rose stationery that has the sort of gridmarked background seems almost true to color, as-advertised, but it's the only one. It really is gorgeous! The one that looks like a light robin's egg blue with pale pink roses on it wasn't true to color: the ones I got are a faded swampy teal color. At first I thought they weren't even the same papers! It's not as bad as it sounds though; somehow it gives me faded vintage wallpaper vibes and I like it. The brown and tan one was disappointing though! It's really hard to see them in the advertised photos but there are pale pale fleur-de-lis things all over the background of it. Well they are not in any way shape or form pale on the sheets I got. The matching envelopes look like the picture but the papers I got have very dark colored brown fleur-de-lis things all over them. You couldn't write over top of them because they are dark and would hide the ink. I'm saying that this pattern, the sheets I got with the too-dark design, is actually UNUSABLE as writing stationery, unless you want to write on the plain white back side of it and not even get to use the pretty side. You could possibly use the paper as it's own envelope by writing on the blank white side and then folding it with the pattern facing out and taping it closed, sticking a shipping label (overtop of most of the prettiness?) with the recipient's address. What I've been doing is using it for giftwrap for small gifts. It's pretty paper and I could think of many uses for it, but it's still really disappointing that I was trying to buy writing stationery and it doesn't really work as that. I feel like I bought a pack of strange-shaped scrapbooking papers, because they are lovely and thick and sturdy like that, but I was hoping for letter writing stationery so I'm a little disappointed as well.So I guess my bottom line is that, even though I'm pretty chill with it this time (because I read the reviews before trying and deemed it worthwhile to try them despite the reported issues), I probably won't be buying this particular stationery again because 1) I'm rather wary what sort of colors I'm going to wind up with (if they'll be too darkly inked to write on again) and 2) because of the size problem I still have the added cost of having to go buy some other stationery to use with the envelopes (some that won't look too shabby next to such pretty envelopes) and a box of the more pricey greeting card envelopes to use with the stationery (since the two do not match one another in size) rendering these no longer cost-effective.",
