                "reviewText": "This is my first time scrapbooking, and this kit is great for beginners. It comes with a lot of different things, and all of them are pretty high quality. There's pages of designs, multiple sticker pages, sets of sheets (memo, to-do list), a small roll of decorative tape, and a notebook. I really liked the small, handheld notebook that it comes with because the texture of the paper and the multiple page bindings are great. The stickers adhere well for the most part, but there is no additional tape/double sided tape to attach the papers to the pages. Thankfully, they attach well with a separately purchased roll of double sided tape. Overall, the pack is very good and easy to use, as long as you have your own tape!",
