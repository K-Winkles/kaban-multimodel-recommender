I want her to learn to journal and write so she doesn't become addicted to screen time like some or her friends.All in all it's a good set and really does look like a lot of fun.",

The box was somewhat sturdy and allowed my daughter to transport her set. She used it to write notes to her friends in school which prompted their parents to buy them as well so the girls could exchange notes back and forth. This has added countless hours of play time while also encouraging my child to write more.",

She (and I) loved everything contained in this lovely unicorn stationery set, right down to the sweet rainbow-heart eraser. All the supplies fit perfectly in the alloted spaces. The top section neatly lifts out to reveal a hidden section underneath which holds the stationery cards.The carrying case is cardboard yet feels like it will hold up well as long as its handled with basic care.Recommend!I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases. Since I rely on reviews, too, I appreciate how helpful they can be. Hope my review has helped you.",

However, this symbol of a female taking a picture of herself in an inappropriate pose with her legs spread open is all over this set. This symbol appears on the box, the ink pad, on every page of the notepad, and on every envelope. I'm glad I noticed this before giving it to my innocent unicorn-loving 6 year old girl!I'm giving this 2 stars only because it contains the advertised items and the quality seems decent enough, but this product simply isn't a gift for a child.",
