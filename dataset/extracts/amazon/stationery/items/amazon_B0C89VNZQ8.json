I bought these bc I fell in love with the colors, thought they were so adorable, had every size I was looking for for sticky notes, and the reviews said way better things about the stickiness than other off-brand post-its.when removing the top sticky, the adhesive is way too stuck and it rips off the thinnest outermost later of the sticky under it, which kinda ruins the \"cute\" factor. then the edges curl up quickly (because trust me, I tried the \"methods\" of peeling it a certain way, but it doesn't work when you need THAT much tension to remove the sticky note since the adhesive feels too strong, but if you do too much, it rips the sticky note.)You would THINK that thats a great thing! but no. once the sticky Is off the pad, it does not stick again. horrible. im really disappointed because the color scheme is just so cute. but not functional. it has so much potential",
