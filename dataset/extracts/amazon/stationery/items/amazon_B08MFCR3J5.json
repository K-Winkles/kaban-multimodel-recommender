                "reviewText": "Lovely paper, very smooth to write on with fountain pen. First sheet I used had slight bleedthrough in places so couldn't use the second side, but that was purely down to a broader nibbed pen laying down more ink. No such issue with the next page written with a finer-nibbed pen, could write on both sides no problem. Really nice designs too. If you're a letter-writer this is good stuff. It's US Letter size 8.5\"x11\"; I also purchased some JAM branded no. 10 sized envelopes to use with this paper as it's a little bit too wide to fit a standard DL envelope comfortably.",
