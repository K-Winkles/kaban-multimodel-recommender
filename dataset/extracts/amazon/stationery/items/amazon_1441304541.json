Qualaity card and blank inside to write your own message. The envelope is a cheery bright green colour with a motive on the back of the envelope. I have used one box up already. I will purchase a couple of boxes for presents. I will certainly purchase more from Peter Pauper designs. Please note: Look at their other design of a blossom tree which is a softer embossed tree and blossom design. The envelope is pink with the blossom detail on the fron of the envelope and also the back of the envelope. Glad I ordered both designs. You have to see the cards to believe how much thought has gone into the presentation of the cards. Love them. By the way I am a customer, I am not promoting for my own ends.",
