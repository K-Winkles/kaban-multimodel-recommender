I bought these plain cards and plan to buy an embosser to see if I can do my own. But even without that, these are just lovely cards to jot a note for any occasion. I plan to teach my grandkids, as my mom taught me, to write notes to anyone that gives a gift. Just a sweet and thoughtful thing to do.Having personalized stationery used to be a must. Now, in the age of texting everything, it's really rare and a delight to receive a handwritten note on quality paper. These are the best I know of. Recommended.",
