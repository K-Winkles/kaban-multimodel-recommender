                "reviewText": "I can\u2019t say enough about this product! We bought several sizes to create a wedding invitation suite and they are PERFECT!!!! The preprinted florals were bold, true to color and crisp. The paper is 140lb CARD (i wouldn\u2019t even say \u201ccardstock\u201d because it was so thick\u2014not cheap feeling). We printed off hundreds of copies without a single issue. **We used the manual feed tray instead of the paper tray** Do not expect these thick cards to print from your printer\u2019s paper tray!!! Any printing issues you have are due to the printer itself and not because of this product. We have a Brother Laser Printer and our ink did not smudge on the invitations. But I will admit that when we printed table numbers (in a very large and bold font) the ink did tend to smudge if it\u2019s touched\u2014again, this is a printer/ink issue and not due to the cardstock. The only drawback is not having more sizes to choose from. We ordered placecards, 4x6, and 5x7. Would love to see an 8.5x11 size to fold for programs or use for stationary. We saved HUNDREDS of dollars using this stationery!",
