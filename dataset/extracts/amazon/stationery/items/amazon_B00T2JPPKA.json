At the same time, I tend to keep my handwritten notes brief. These Crane Notes are classy! They are made with shorter notes in mind, so just a few sentences fit perfectly and look appropriate for the card. Monetarily, they are much better quality than most greeting cards and cost much less. I consider it an all around win.",
