                "reviewText": "I've been buying stationery sets from Peter Pauper Press for many months now and love the various designs, having bought several of them. I rotate amongst my 4 favorites, this being one of them. The paper is a good size and the sets come with coordinating envelopes. My only negative comment is that there is not enough paper for my type of letter writing. Each set comes with 30 sheets of paper and 24 envelopes. I typically use between 3-5 sheets for each daily letter so I am accumulating quite a surplus of envelopes. Wish it were possible to buy the paper alone on occasion to allow me to use up some of them. The boxes that the sets come in are great, too. I keep them when the paper is gone and have made a holder (similar to a small dresser) where the boxes serve as \"drawers\" to keep pens, stamps, etc. organized.",

The mottled blue page with bright silvered lined flowers in the corner is full of delicate, feminine expression. The thickness of the paper is perfect as well-- no fear of the ink making ugly marks on the back side of the page. I am a stationery hound and out of all of the sets I have ever had, received, and seen, I am surely most happy with this one. I will be back for more because this family owned business knows how to please!",

The product itself receives 5 stars from me, and I greatly look forward to writing handwritten letters on this stationary.My item was ordered new (directly from Pauper Press) from the \"other sellers\" list, but the hard box that contains the stationary had one damaged corner (pictured) and two corners that did not appear new (slightly ripped/torn edges). Additionally, the plastic cover over the open faced, hard box was held in place by scotch tape (pictured), and one side had already been opened (pictured).I don't question that the item was new; inside the box were all 30 sheets of stationary and 24 envelopes in perfect condition. But although the package seemed sturdy and undamaged, the box within that contains the stationary was not in new condition.I have always loved the excellent quality of the products I receive from Peter Pauper Press and this stationary is no exception. My only disappointment is the condition of its box, but as that will only be used for storing the stationary, it isn't a major concern to me.",

It's really a shame that letter writing is becoming a dying art with paper like this on the market. The flower design is nice. Actually I bought stationary paper from this same seller only a different design. Will be buying more as it good when wanting to use a fountain pen. Quality at a very nice price. The envelopes compliment t the paper nicely.",
