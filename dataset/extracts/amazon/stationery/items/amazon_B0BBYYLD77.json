First thing noticed was the beautifully colored paper in pastel hues. You get all the different varieties of color and form as shown in the Amazon pictures. The notepaper is lined on both sides and has a high quality feel. Just the right thickness and smoothness to the touch. The envelopes are the same great quality paper and nicely holds a sheet folded in half. What surprised me is there is no adhesive to seal the envelope. No worries though. The paper is thick enough that you could easily use a glue stick to moisten envelope edges for secure closure. It\u2019s no big deal considering this set is of high quality and the quantity of paper is well worth the price. Letter writing seems to be a lost art. Why not buy this set and get a pen pal. Better yet, write a letter of gratitude to someone who\u2019s made a difference in your life. \ud83d\ude0a",

Only other thing worth mentioning is the images on several sets of paper and envelopes are extremely pixeled- not a clear image. With artistic help you can add your own detail to distract from the pixels, otherwise a bit disappointing. For the price however, I'm too bummed. Pretty decent overall. Great value for what you get. If you don't want pixeled images maybe don't go for the japanese landscape theme-",
