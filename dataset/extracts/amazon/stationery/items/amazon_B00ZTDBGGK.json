                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A beautiful 'romantic vintage floral' style stationery variety set.",
                "reviewText": "Some of the sayings may not be appropriate for just any recipient. Going by how they are numbered in photos #4&5, here is what it written on each one, within the quotes exactly as it is written, including how it is punctuated and capitalized (or not) and a typo on #3 that it took me a bit to notice.1. \"un hasard, des relations, un amour\" which means something like 'a chance, relationships, love' according to the online translator I plugged it into.2. \"On this day I want you to know that you are a very special person\"3. \"Please always know that I love you more than anything erse in the world.\" yes it says 'erse' instead of 'else' which must be a typo, and the ink on the saying is very light so I didn't notice immediately.4. \"La vie, c'est comme une boite de chocolat, on ne sait jamais sur quoi on va tomber.\" which is something like the famous 'life is like a box of chocolates...' quote that everyone knows from the Forrest Gump movie.5. \"Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking out ward together in the same direction.\"6. \"Fleur de Coeur\" which my online translator says means 'heart flower,' and then below that it says: \"The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.\"Stationery #6 is the only one that has anything printed on the back: the back of #6 matches the floral inside of the envelope and has the same saying as the front. The rest are blank on the backs. All have lines on the fronts of the sheets to write on.The stationery papers are 13.5 cm wide x 17.75cm tall- this is well within the range of normal handwriting stationery size. I saw a lot of complaints about the stationery being \"too small\" and can only assume the people complaining of this didn't have penpals as a kid or they are used to computer printer letterhead or the letter sized legal pads and aren't used to the size of handwriting stationery. I had over 80 penpals as a teen and have an addiction to stationery: I have seen many many many handwriting stationery papers so the size of these did not surprise me at all. If you need it to be a specific size then I suggest you use my measurements to confirm the size isn't going to be a problem.The envelopes are the perfect size to comfortably and easily fit 2 sheets of this stationery folded in half. The papers are very thick and sturdy. The colors aren't blindingly bright but they aren't weak, they are pastel shades appropriate for a vintage romantic floral theme.The envelopes do not have pre-glued flaps!! Pre gluing envelopes as a standard practice is actually an American and European thing. These little stationery sets are made in Asia where it's rare to find envelopes preloaded with lickable goop. But really why would you WANT to lick your envelope shut anyway? Nasty flavor and papercut tongue... yuck. I'm glad these don't come preglued and seal just fine with a 24-cent school glue stick. Swipe, swipe, stick, done!Overall I was pleased with these little stationery sets, however it needs to be noted that the description is partially wrong in that it says there are 6 papers and 3 envelopes per style but that there are 32 total sheets of stationery. That doesn't add up since 6 kinds x 6 papers of each would come to 36 papers not 32. The *total* is actually correctly stated at 32 papers but for each style of papers they come in a plastic sleeve (instead of the pictured little paper band, which I prefer the plastic sleeve since it keeps them very clean and organized) that contains 4 sheets and 2 envelopes (NOT 6 and 3)! There will be 8 of the plastic sleeves, so you should indeed get 32 papers and 16 envelopes as one sleeve of each of the 6 kinds plus 2 more sleeves that are duplicates.The free bonus label seal stickers I received are squares about 3.5cm across, paper lunch sack brown with 2 sayings; \"thank you handmade\" and \"a present for you\" - both of which I find a little awkwardly worded to stick on a letter envelope. Oh well they were free and I'm creative: I'm certain I can find a cute use for them. :)",
