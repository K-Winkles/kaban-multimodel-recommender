It does hold printer ink, but takes a couple of hours to dry or it smudges. The printer ink also looks a bit blotchy, I think because the paper doesn't let the ink bleed like normal paper. You can still get crisp details, as you can see in the picture, but it looks faded. Maybe it would look better with a very high quality printer, I'm not sure.Still, great paper and I will buy it again. I wish there was an option to only buy the paper and not the envelopes.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this set to send a note to friends and family. Hoping to class things up beyond a traditional piece of white printer paper and a business envelope, we went with this. The \"antique aged\" look is very nice and looks just like it did in the photo. There was also a bit more firmness to each page that elevated it's feel beyond a normal sheet of paper. The envelopes matched the paper exactly and completely fit the paper when tri-folded. I mention this because I have been dismayed when other sets I've purchased don't fit inside perfectly.My biggest concern was that it wouldn't work well with the printer. Sometimes with these types of paper the printer ink bleeds through, comes out a bit wonky, or just doesn't look right. This worked in the printer absolutely perfectly. After it was printed on, it returned to its shape and didn't appear to be run through a printer. You can see in the photo below how clear and flawless it printed. We hand addressed each envelope and the paper was also nice to write on.This is a great set for elevating any note that you are sending to a group of people. It really stands out and looks sharp. Considering the cost of having things done at a print shop, this set is an absolute steal for making an at home project look pro.",
