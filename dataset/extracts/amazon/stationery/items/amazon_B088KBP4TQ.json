They are absolutely priceless. Each animal sheet had ears that stuck up and a paw that kept the folded letter in place, plus, there was a sticker to seal the envelope. I bought many types of stationary supplies for this project, and this was the cutest and also the best buy. I plan to buy some sets to send to youngsters in my life.

                "reviewText": "I send cards to our grandchildren on a regular basis. I like cute cards that are blank inside so that I can write a very simple note, sign it and add cute stickers to decorate it on the inside. I happened to see these when I was searching for more cards to buy for the grandchildren and I knew these would be a great delight for the grandkids. They are so cute.",

                "reviewText": "Awesome stationary! Cute designs (the letter folds easy and tucks into the animals\u2019 front paws to keep the letter closed). We got these, along with a Melissa and dough mailbox set for each Fmaily member, and had an evening of writing each other encouraging letters. My kids loved using these. Made it very fun and memorable. My 7 yr old son said it was the \u201cbest day ever,\u201d and kept thanking me for getting these. We kept out letters received in little keepsake boxes, and keep the extras in a basket next to the mailboxes for a fun surprising note for each other once in a while. These just made this activity even more enjoyable. Thank you.",
