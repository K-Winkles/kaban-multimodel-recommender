It would\u2019ve been a nice bonus if the inner envelope had a pretty, colorful pattern to coordinate with the cards like they often do. Maybe they thought that would be too much & that\u2019s why they went with the repeated \u201cMarimekko\u201d text in black & white printed inside the envelopes. Nonetheless, I will be buying more because I never want to run out of them! Go ahead & treat yourself to some eye candy!\ud83d\ude0d",
