                "reviewText": "Very nice quality paper and design. Nevertheless, the butterfly embossed on the front leaves the back side of thatarea ( inside, above the fold) not really suitable for writing because it isn\u2019t smooth. And because the back of the note paper below the fold has \u201cPapyrus\u201d written in the middle, it probably shouldn\u2019t be used for the message either. That leaves a small area ( inside below the fold - or 1/4 of the total front and back area) that\u2019s truly suitable for the message. I would redesign back so \u201c Papyrus\u201d appears at the very bottom of page and the rest would be useable for writing. Sorry - probably should have made a video to describe everything but don\u2019t know how to.Sorry for the poor description - just hard to identify which part of the notepaper",
