I share our home with our dog (Mr Sparkles) and although he's great company, sometimes my mind wanders and heart aches for Randy's touch. I like to use the stationery to write letters to Randy, just like we would if he was off to war. I will compose my thoughts into long paragraphs and let him know how he makes me feel. The pages are fairly durable and often soak up tear drops that end up on the page. The stationery can also hold scents quite well, although I'd recommend using a scented lotion over a body spray. The oils in the lotion will fuse with the paper better and allow for the paper to smell for 60-70% longer than a traditional body spray. Being around bears all day, Randy doesn't have the best workplace smellscape. He says that my scented letters are a welcome change for when he gets back to his living quarters that he shares with the other workers.If you're a postal worker and you see one of my letters pass through your sorting station, take a sniff...you won't be disappointed. :)",

This way the unused stationery remains in pristine condition until you are ready to use it. I'm very pleased. Writing letters has become a lost art, but I still like to write them. Stickers to seal the envelopes are also included. Whether you use them or not, it's a nice touch. I highly recommend this stationery. It would be fine as thank-you notes, too!

It\u2019s smooth with a medium tooth.The inside of the envelopes are dyed to match the paper which is fun.All in all, as long as you come in with the expectation that the colors are misrepresented, it\u2019s ok.
