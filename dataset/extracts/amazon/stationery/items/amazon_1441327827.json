I love the linen texture on the front and back of the cards, and the smooth inside takes fountain pen ink beautifully, indicating that this is high quality card stock. The gold foil candles and polka dots on the front of the card are very pretty. I'm finding that note cards from the Peter Pauper Press are really well-designed and a tremendous value for the money. Right now I have six boxes of their cards, and many of the people I send them to are actually complimenting me on how nice they are. Check them out! Odds are, you'll love them, too.",
