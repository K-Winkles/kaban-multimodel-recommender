It's absolutely beautiful and very much want I wanted in terms of quality. Depending on the wetness of the fountain pen, there is no ghosting and definitely no bleed through. The paper is A5 size, which I wasn't expecting. Although I wanted a letter size page, this product exceeded my expectation and needs. I highly recommend this for any one who wants simple, but high quality paper for writing letters.Pros:-Fountain pen friendly-No ghosting or bleedthrough-Pretty and not gaudy-Can write on both sides of the sheetCons:-A5 sized (stated on the page but not emphasized)-Can be a little pricey for the size of pages",
