This paper fits that bill very well. It looks great and it is thicker than normal notebook paper. If you are using a pen to write, be aware that some of the fountain types will bleed through a little bit depending on how long you keep the nib to the paper. Overall I love this paper and will be purchasing again. (P.S. write a loved one an actual letter. People love it when you take the time and effort to write out an actual letter to mail to them, especially spouses and this paper just adds to the experience.)",
