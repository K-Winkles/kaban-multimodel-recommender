I would have given 5 stars but they had enough for 30 bags but it only came with 20 bags. So I had to go purchase more bags to cover the rest of the goody bags. I bought some candy as well to add into the bags. But they were a big hit the kids loved the pencils and notebooks. I really enjoyed making the goody bags it was the perfect valentine's day bag. If your a teacher this would be perfect to give out to the kids for valentine's day.",

                "reviewText": "I have put gift bags like this together with items purchased separately before, and the price can really add up, so it's nice to get everything you need in one kit, enough for 30 classmates. The quality of the pencils, erasers, and bookmarks is very good. The notepads are stapled which made them feel a little cheaper than if they'd been bound with sewing or glue, but they're not bad. For a dollar a piece to make a complete gift, you can't do much better, and this is a good choice for classrooms where you have to be careful with allergies since so many candy options have nuts. Overall I would recommend for the class Valentine exchange or for a teacher who wants a cute gift for students.",
