I guess since so many people correspond through emails now, nice stationery has been hard to find. I love the personal touch of handwritten correspondence, so I ordered this stationery set on Amazon. I am very glad that I did!I received 6 sets of individually wrapped writing paper/envelopes in really pretty, soft styles and patterns of flowers, birds and plants. The stationery/envelopes are of strong quality, and the front of the stationery is lined, while the back has the soft, lovely pattern printed on it. The envelopes match the pattern printed on the writing paper.This stationery is a wonderful value, and is perfect for letter writers like myself. The patterns can be mixed or matched, and the recipients will just love them. I highly recommend this great stationery set!",

I write letters every week to my sister-in-law, and I love this matching set of paper and envelopes. The edges are scalloped and the border of the pages have a matching color to the envelopes. Each set is individually wrapped, so they won't get scattered, bent, or misplaced - a very handy detail to the packaging.This is a great set for girly girls who want to start letter writing again, or for those who already do and are looking to spruce up their stationary. Takes the ink well and adds great enjoyment to my weekly letter writing.",
