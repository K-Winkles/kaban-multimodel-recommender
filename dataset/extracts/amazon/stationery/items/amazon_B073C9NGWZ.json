                "reviewText": "This paper is stunning, but I did struggle a bit to see what fountain pen ink was compatible with it. I have both the Waterman Noir Intense Black Ink and the Platinum Carbon Ink, and the Waterman writes too dry on this paper and skips, making it a really unpleasant experience, but the Platinum Carbon writes like a dream on this paper with no bleed, ghosting, or feathering. Absolutely stunning. I\u2019m pretty sure for this type of paper, you\u2019ll need an ink type that has enough pigmentation to stick to it, otherwise it\u2019s quite dry to write on for more water based inks. I definitely would recommend if you use Platinum Carbon Ink or have inks that has more pigment in them.",
