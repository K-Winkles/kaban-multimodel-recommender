                "reviewText": "We used this as my son\u2019s main crib for 4 months while we were in escrow/renovating our house. At first, I purchased a pack n play, and I immediately returned it because the mattress in the pack n play was so thin and I couldn\u2019t imagine having my baby sleep on it for an extended period of time. It was also not easy or quick to set up or tear down. I thoroughly researched alternate travel cribs and narrowed it down to the Bjorn and the Lotus. I decided on this one because of the mattress and the ease of set up and tear down. Here are the things I love about it:-it takes less than a minute to set up or tear down.-the mattress is thick and comfortable-it can fit through doorways-it is very lightweight and compact for travel-it looks niceSo, now for the things I don\u2019t love-it is kind of an awkward shape (think super large briefcase) when in it\u2019s case, and won\u2019t fit in a duffle-style roller luggage. I had to buy a large, rectangle rolling suitcase in order to pack it and not have to pay the fee to only check the travel crib.- this was not an issue for us, but if you nurse or rock your baby to sleep, it is hard to lay your baby down (especially if you\u2019re short) because the mattress sits on the floor. The Lotus has a zipper on the bottom, so you can lay with your baby in the crib if need be.In all, I don\u2019t think you can go wrong with either, but I would 100% purchase this again and I recommend it to all my friends.",

                "reviewText": "Have used this travel crib both at home and away. Our 7 month old took to it right away and sleeps soundly on the soft mattress. I also sleep soundly knowing that he is safe since he can't climb out (he is now 10 months) or hurt himself on the structure of the crib since the legs jut out far enough from the mesh siding. I can pop this open in less than 30 seconds and pack it away in the same amount of time! Easy breezy.",

                "reviewText": "I am so glad I purchased this. My little one (15 mo) had a very hard time sleeping in the traditional pack n play that we had - plus it was always so tough to set up and take down. This crib is AMAZING. Not only did it take like 10 seconds with minimal effort to put up and take down, but my son slept just like he was at home in his normal crib. The mattress is soft and comfortable (based on my son\u2019s ability to fall asleep so quickly). The crib also is a great size and doesn\u2019t take up alot of space (considering if you\u2019re staying in a traditional hotel room). If you are considering getting a new travel crib, GET THIS ONE! We are so grateful we did!",

Setting it up and breaking it down is straightforward and easy enough.The dimensions when folded mean it won't fit in your luggage (unless you maybe have the biggest suitcase ever made), so you need to pay to put it in checked luggage on the plane. In some airports it comes out in \"oversized baggage\" (though it's not really that big), so look there when you don't see it with the rest of your checked luggage.",

                "reviewText": "This travel crib is easy to set up and take apart. Some of the reviews say the mattress is thin and it is, but not excessively so (you don't want a plush mattress for your infant anyway). The only quasi negative thing I would say for this is that it is pretty deep and if you're short it might be difficult to get your baby in and out. I'm 5'2\" and I can get my baby in and out safely, but she already had good head control when I bought it so I could sit her up a bit and then grab her. If she was a newborn it might have been an issue for me.",
