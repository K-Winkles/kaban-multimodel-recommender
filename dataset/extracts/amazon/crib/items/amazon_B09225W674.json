It\u2019s light without anything in it and can be stretched if needed. The straps at the top are very sturdy. Makes a great gift.",

I would say it holds a small box of diapers and its pouch depending on the size of diaper use. The pockets on the side are great to use for extra bibs lotion creams and so forth.The only downfall is that I wish the top was more sturdy. I put a pack of wipes on top and it sags down if there isn\u2019t enough diapers to hold it up. I wish there was more structure in the diaper holder to have the top board more sturdy for the wipes.",
