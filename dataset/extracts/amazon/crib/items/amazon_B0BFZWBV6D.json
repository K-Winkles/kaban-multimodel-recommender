                "reviewText": "Absolutely thrilled with my purchase of the Baby Delight Horizon Full Size Mesh Crib! As a new parent, finding the perfect crib was a top priority, and this one ticks all the boxes. What impressed me most was the safety-focused design. The mesh walls are a game changer \u2013 they not only provide fantastic airflow, ensuring my baby sleeps soundly, but also give me peace of mind knowing there's no risk of tiny limbs getting stuck.The sturdy metal frame is another standout feature. It's robust yet doesn't compromise on aesthetics, fitting beautifully into our nursery space. I was also pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to set up. I'm no DIY expert, but the tool-free assembly was straightforward and hassle-free, almost like setting up a playard.What's more, the crib's portability is a major plus. It folds compactly and slips into the included storage bag, making it perfect for travel or when we need extra space. And although it didn\u2019t come with a mattress, it fits a full-size one, which was exactly what I wanted.All in all, this crib is a standout product \u2013 well-designed, safe, stylish, and practical. A solid 5 stars from this happy parent!",

                "reviewText": "Got this crib sent to my parents house to use when we visit with the baby. It\u2019s a cross between a pack-n-play and a crib. Much lighter than our wooden crib and more sturdy than the traditional pack-n-play. Plus you use a full size mattress (not included) so much better for baby! It was not hard to set up. They include instructions in a pocket on the crib bottom but I hardly looked at it. You snap it together like a pack-n-play, reinforce it with the extra rails, then zip it all up. The zippers are snug and a two person job but it makes sense because you don\u2019t want the mesh sides having a lot of slack in them. Disassembly isn\u2019t hard either - just use a phone or piece of metal to hold the button in on the railings to take apart.",

Since it\u2019s not for regular use, it didn\u2019t need to be as convenient as something like a Pack and Play, it just needed to be sturdy, as large as advertised, and reasonably easy to assemble.I don\u2019t know if we received a defective product, or if they are all this terrible, but we are utterly defeated by the horrific design. We got it out to try setting it up before our trip, and I\u2019m not sure if we will ever be able to disassemble it without the help of a chainsaw. Parts that should easily lock and unlock are instead bound together by unbreakable force. Hard to describe how awful this thing is.Glad we tried it in advance, I guess, so we can scramble and find something else to buy ON TOP of the $200 we spent on this thing.",

Unfolds within minutes and has padded base for bottom of crib (same as a pack n play). This does not work as a mattress so I ordered a 2\u201d foam mattress topper that can roll up into a vacuum seal bag for traveling.The crib comes with 12 support rails for top and bottom of crib to make it sturdier. I did NOT install these and it was just as sturdy and stable as standard pack n play. Only installed the top back rail that holds up the \u201cheadboard\u201d piece so that the mesh was taught. If I were using this as a full time use crib then rails are a nice bonus.* rails also weigh a lot, so carrying case was significantly heavier with them.Overall it is slightly more inconvenient to put together than regular pack n play but having the full size crib space is worth it for me!",

                "reviewText": "I love this crib because it was literally the only one that did what we needed it to do, which in our case was have soft sides and fit a full-sized mattress. The mesh sides keep my baby from wrapping his legs all around the wooden slats, as well as from falling over as he likes to do and banging his head on the wood. Using a full sized regular crib mattress obviously allows for more comfort and a bigger space. Set up was honestly a breeze for me and probably took all of ten minutes, and no tools.In case you\u2019re wondering:- the mesh does stretch a little bit so it may create a small pocket to try and stick your face into. The crib is JPMA certified for safety, and our baby slept in a bassinet when he was smaller, so I am okay with it for those reasons. The walls are stretchier than solid wood, but much more taut than our mesh play yard.- Is this thing portable? Yes and no. It fits into a duffel bag. If you\u2019re in between babies and need to store it, you might lose it in your closet. If you want to transport it, you don\u2019t need a u-haul. Heck, you could hop on the bus with this thing without getting so much as a second glance from anyone. With that being said, would I want to travel with this? Probably not. It\u2019s lighter than most regular cribs, but heavier than tons of travel cribs. It\u2019s also more annoying than other travel cribs to put together. Set up was easy, but not I-wanna-do-this-every-night easy. Most importantly, the biggest advantage of this thing over other mesh cribs is that it fits a full-sized crib mattress, and those are usually not very portable at all. The crib does come with a thinner mattress pad that conveniently folds into the duffel bag as well, but I doubt it\u2019s much better than other travel cribs out there. My advice would be: if you want to bring your child\u2019s actual full sized crib somewhere with you for whatever reason, this is the crib to do it with. If, however, you\u2019re looking for an easy-to-set-up crib to travel around with, I would look into bigger play yards as an alternative.- The crib sits up off the floor, which I like, so the baby is not on the floor directly, but it does only have the lowest mattress height setting, so you have to bend down pretty low to pick up and put down LO.- The crib is not easy to climb out of. Depending on your child, they may or may not get out, but the mesh gives way more than wood, and climbing out is a challenge.- The top and bottom parts are metal. That makes the crib extra sturdy, although the carcass is pretty hard. In our case though, the walls are high enough where my baby does not chew it or hit his head on it.- As every other reviewer said, instructions are there, they\u2019re inside a dedicated crib pouch.Overall, it\u2019s been a great crib for us, and I would recommend it.",
