Bassinet does NOT fold into carry case...just the play yard. So we end up having a nice compact play yard as illustrated, but then have to carry around the bassinet fully assembled because it doesn\u2019t fold or have a travel bag.",

                "reviewText": "I have bought this mini pack n play atleast 2-3 times. When it first came on the market about 10 years ago I fell in love, had to replace due to loss a couple years later for my next baby. Flash forward 8 years and it was on the top of my list! We have limited space and love to camp and this will come in so handy as we have a tent and more gear than our vehicle can carry. It packs up so easy and small, the bassinet part can fold flat for travel with a little work. I can\u2019t say I LOVE the new features with the detachable bassinet part. It\u2019s cool you can have it raised so you can see in it from your bed without getting up. But we really don\u2019t use it that way nor do we use the bassinet without the whole set up. Just isn\u2019t super convenient that way. The original product had 3 mattress heights achieved with a sling and I liked that much better. It\u2019s still a great product and I recommend it to everyone but I would like the option to have that original style back.",
