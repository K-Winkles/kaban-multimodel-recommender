                "reviewText": "As an Indian man, I recently purchased the Waterwood 10pcs M6 Barrel Bolts with the hope of enhancing the durability and stability of my furniture, including beds, cribs, and chairs. Unfortunately, my experience with these barrel bolts has been quite disappointing, and I feel compelled to share my perspective.Firstly, the size and design of these barrel bolts seem incompatible with many traditional Indian furniture styles. The M6 size may be suitable for certain Western furniture, but it falls short when it comes to the broader range of dimensions and styles found in Indian households. This limitation made it challenging to integrate these bolts seamlessly into my existing furniture, leading to an unsatisfactory outcome.The quality of the materials used in the Waterwood barrel bolts also left much to be desired. The durability and strength required for securing heavy furniture pieces were lacking, and I found the bolts to be less robust than expected. This compromises the overall reliability of these bolts, especially for furniture that experiences frequent use or weight-bearing requirements.",
