I first saw it on the Huck Finn website from Albany and started searching around because I wanted free shipping with it. The only downside was the shipping, Amazon shipped through XPO and my first crib was lost so I had to reorder. We got it assembled last night in literally 25 minutes and it is beautiful!! It's such a good quality. I am extremely happy with this purchase",

                "reviewText": "Two problems. First, Evelour makes an inferior product - zero quality control. You'd think we bought a cheap $100 crib rather than the $700+ we spent on this. The first one we bought had parts of each siderail missing paint; one of those siderails was also cracking where they put wood filler in and painted over it; top rail of the foot board had a crack completely through it, leaving a sharp edge that would certainly harm any child inside of it. Shipping care is also an issue. Both times the box looked like it had been dropped, drug, and stepped on causing additional damage. Will not buy from Evelour again, regardless if it's being sold by Amazon, BuyBuy Baby, or any other retailer.",

We had to assemble this crib since Amazon didn\u2019t have a white glove delivery option and it was very simple. Overall the quality seems higher than many other nursery furniture options seen in store.",
