Wish they had more color options so I could\u2019ve bought another one for my baby boy coming this week.Big tip would be buy a fabric that doesn\u2019t fray or split or loosen from a local craft store to wrap the top rails. The crib is real wood and teethers will go to town on them. Don\u2019t want baby eating wood.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this crib in antique grey mist and it is absolutely stunning in person. Assembly is a bit difficult to complete by a single person (proven by the cursing and colorful language that emanated from my handy husband as he put it together last night,) but mostly because the individual pieces are so big. That being said, he managed to put it together successfully in about 45 minutes with no damage to the crib and minimal harm done to his ego.The crib is of sturdy construction and seems like it will stand up to all of our child's life stages. (However, we haven't reached the chewing stage yet, so we have yet to see if she's able to chew off all the finish on the rails like our son managed to do with his old crib.I love that this crib also converts to a toddler bed (toddler guard rail not included), a day bed, and a full size bed with the option of a headboard and footboard or just a headboard. This crib will definitely grow with our child and we hope it will be the only bed she ever needs!This is a beautiful addition to our nursery and we absolutely love it!",

                "reviewText": "Arrived well packaged and assembled quickly into an impressive finished product. I am more than impressed.The wife just had to have this crib, and I knew it would be a pain to ship something this big. My fears were confirmed on shipping, but this is a product review so I will stick to the point.The crib goes together quickly and easily. I was all geared up for a project, and had less than 20 screws between me and a finished item on the to-do list. The crib was packed well and arrived unscathed despite the outward appearance of the shipping box.The joints fit together tightly and I had no issues with stripped screws or cheap hardware. The finished product is substantial, no loose or rickety connections. I have helped assemble cribs for my buddies that left me underwhelmed and glad I didn\u2019t have any kids that would sleep in them. This crib came together nicely and appears as though it will more than outlive our use for it.Be prepared for shipping issues as the typical carriers won\u2019t touch this one. The party responsible for the final leg of the journey was terrible. Amazon customer service was the only reason this crib arrived before our baby graduated from college.If your bride likes this crib, and if you can actually get it delivered, waste no time and order this one.",
