The chestnut color looks really nice. Paired it with a Shiloh musical mobile and a dual-sided standard crib mattress + organic waterproof mattress cover + organic cotton fitted crib sheet (make sure never to use bumpers, pillows, blankets/quilts, toys etc. around baby while in the crib). Has 4 levels to raise/lower mattress as needed. Make sure to buy the toddler bed- as well as the full size-conversion kits (both sold separately) to ensure the convertible crib's usage till the kid is well into their teen years (and beyond, as a guest bed). And don't forget to register all your baby products!Only thing was that I had to wait for about a month for it to arrive, but Amazon was on top of it and shipped it out as soon as it was manufactured , as a result of which I received a brand new piece!",

Luckily the lady I spoke with was understanding and nice and has heard this same complaint before and was happy to send me new parts to replace the damaged ones.",

I am happy to report that I was very pleased with this purchase. It arrived in one large box and was well packaged. There were only two minor scratches (see photos), and I think it would be a miracle if it arrived with zero blemishes. I am 35 weeks pregnant and assembled this crib myself. That's not to say it wouldn't be easier with two people, but it's doable with one. The instructions weren't great, but I navigated them and assembled it without any problems. The only additional thing you need is a phillips head screwdriver. The frame is sturdy, and the wood seems to be sturdy as well. I haven't used the crib yet, so I cannot make a comment on its durability, but it seems like it will hold up well. It also seems like it will be easy to drop the mattress spring to a lower level once needed. Overall, I would recommend this crib, especially for the price!",

That part was a bit difficult. I would highly suggest getting a second person to help with assembly. It comes with a toddler rail. Side rails will have to be purchased separately. I really hope they are available when it's time to change to a big boy bed.",
