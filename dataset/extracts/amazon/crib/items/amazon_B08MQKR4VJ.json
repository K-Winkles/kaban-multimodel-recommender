My 19 month old is really enjoying the ability to crawl into and out of his bed all by himself and so am I! Plus the ability to still keep him contained after he is in by zipping it closed is fabulous. The zipper has worked perfectly, regardless of whether he is in it or not at the time. I haven't needed to wash it yet, but I'm so glad to be able to when it needs it, unlike most other options. Now, we've only been using this product for a month, but so far I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a play yard/travel sleeping area that is light weight, washable, easy to transport, and allows a toddler to get in and out without having to be lifted, but still being able to be contained.",

                "reviewText": "I have two of these - one for home/travel and one for my office (my daughter regularly comes to work with me). It is genuinely easy to set up and take up - set-up takes me 30 seconds, take-down 1-2 minutes. Very light, but it feels sturdy when set up and my daughter is a rambunctious one. I would suggest putting a blanket or crib cover over the mattress as it does attract lint, but this isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for me.",

I like that the mattress lays on the floor so I don\u2019t worry about bowing. My 7 mo adjusted great. Also very lightweight and easy to carey",
