I wanted something that would be able to grow with our son and would be appropriate to use in his room as he grows into a young man and I think this crib is perfect for that!We chose the Antique Brown. The color is a rich dark brown and I love that it has some character in the wood tone. It\u2019s made very well and the carvings in the wood make it feel like an expensive piece.My husband was able to put this crib together by himself in one night with no complaints and I was able to adjust the mattress position by myself once our son began to stand.Overall, I\u2019m very happy with our purchase.",

The main front and back sections were cracked down the middle like someone tried to fold them like playing cards.The second one had several shards of plastic \"trim\" pieces broken off the main headboard in the box, as well as some white fuzz on one of the joints that looked like cobwebs/mold.We are returning this second one as well and just buying one from a local store.The crib would look nice, if it came whole. Overall I'm not impressed.",

The only reason I\u2019m giving four stars is because there were still some scratches on the footboard and headboard when it arrived but not bad enough for us to return it. It is really beautiful and looks great in our nursery.",
