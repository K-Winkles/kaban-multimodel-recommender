                "reviewText": "Very good quality for price, I thought. I purchased this mini crib because we live in a small apartment, and a standard crib would simply not fit in our allotted space.The seafoam green color is beautiful and exactly as pictured. Ours did not have nicks or dents. The instructions were easy to follow, and parts clearly labeled. I, a petite female, assembled fairly easily with very minimal assistance (just \"hold this piece while I screw it in\" sort of help was required, and only twice). Definitely would recommend to a friend!Only complaint would be I purchased a better mattress thinking it would fit, and it did not, but that is probably more my own fault than anything else. Still very glad I bought it!!! I am fairly certain it will last through at least two children.",

                "reviewText": "I went through a lot of reviews and mini cribs on Amazon trying to pick the right one. I saw this seafoam green crib and I really liked the unique color. It looks exactly like the color online so I am happy with that. I didn't have any dents or damages on the crib itself. It did have a weird gray dark discoloration on the wood part the mattress goes on, but it isn't going to bother me since it will be covered with the mattress anyway. I like the backboard incase I decide to put the baby's name on it later. The thin mattress of course is really nothing but I went ahead and ordered a 4 inch mattress for it and it should come in a few days from amazon. I wanted this to be a space saver since baby will be in our room and our room had no space for a standard sized crib. We have limited space next to our king sized bed. But in the pics you can see it fits just right next to our huge bed. I did read reviews about the strong smell. Boy did this crib have such a strong smell. At first I couldn't handle how strong it was. The first few nights sleeping next to this crib was awful because of the smell. I almost slept on the couch lol. But after a little over a week the smell was gone and I even wiped it down with lysol wipes thinking it would help the smell go away faster. It was a little bit bothering. My boyfriend said nothing about it but man for me it was strong. It was easy instructions and I put it together real fast. Overall, I think it's super cute and I love it. I totally recommend, just build it in another room and let the smell go away first if you plan to have it in your room.",

                "reviewText": "Starting with the packaging it came very well padded with lots of Styrofoam and separating sheets, nothing was severely damaged just had a couple edges that must have been bumped during packing so the paint was chipped. Assembly was very easy and the hardware was all very high grade. Once fully assembled it is very solid with my rocking or wobbling even when I applied pressure to it. It's not the heavy duty $600 cribs at Nebraska Furniture Mart but it is well built and holds together very well, as long as every couple months you re-torque all your bolts it feels like it should last at least 3 to 4 years and thats not a bad ROI and I love that green color, it's not shiny it's very matte so it looks even more premium as a result.",

We assembled it and put the mattress in, turned up our HEPA filter to high, waited 24 hours and the smell only got worse. We just could not put our baby in there to sleep in good faith. We disassembled and packed it back up to return, and the room STILL smells as well as the mattress and crib sheet we had in it. It\u2019s terrible this crib hasn\u2019t been taken off the market yet, but I can only imagine it\u2019ll take some babies getting sick from it for them to listen. Learn from our mistake.
