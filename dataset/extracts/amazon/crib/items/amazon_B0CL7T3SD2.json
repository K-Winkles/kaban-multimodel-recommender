We searched all the packaging and the area in the bedroom to find the broken piece (thinking maybe it got broken in shipping and we could maybe fix it)...it wasn't there!This was clearly a defective piece of product intentionally placed when being packaged, before being sold and shipped! The crib itself is beautiful and sturdy, just this broken part is why I'm giving 3 stars. When the baby is old enough to stand we will have to somehow fix it so she doesn't get cut or get splinters.
