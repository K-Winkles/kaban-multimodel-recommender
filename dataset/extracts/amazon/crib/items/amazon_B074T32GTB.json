                "reviewText": "I really enjoy this product. Had it for over 6 months and baby is 1 now. I used the standard cushy bumper while Jacob was small but as he began to roll around and toss and turn in his sleep he would snuggle up against the bumper. After coming in to find him with his nose in the bumper I removed it. Followed by waking up 4 times a night to retrieve his pacifier I decided we needed something else. I saw this product in a magazine and rushed to amazon to find it. I ended up getting the brown after switching back and forth from the blue (the rest of his bedding is navy, light blue, tan, and brown) and I think it looks good on our dark cherry colored crib. I have a drop side crib so the separate pieces work well (especially because when Jake attempts to climb I have to readjust usually just that side. Although there are gaps where the long side ends and the short side begins, I was so glad the pacifiers had a better chance of staying in. I did made one adjustment, the longest side is wrapped around the end posts instead of the slats because the gaps are too big the other way luckily the long end is long enough to make it all the way and it does not interfere with the drop side usage. now there is just a small gap on the front side that is rarely a problem. You will have to occasionally fish a pacifier out from in between the mesh and the mattress in between the slats (if that makes sense.) I find 1 to 2 surprise pacifiers when i lift the mattress on washing day. You can also make the Velcro as tight as you want it... tighter means it is less likely to collapse down as easily, but can make it easier for a climber to get a lift. looser will make it hard to climb, but the looser fabric can decrease the breath ability if it gets squished down early in the sleeping cycle. Overall, i love this product because it does keep the pacifier in and is breathable and collapsible also the Velcro is very strong. I have washed it 3 or 4 times and it holds up nicely but tends to grab lint, so i recommend washing it with sheets only and no blankets... not a big deal. If you don't have a drop-side crib i recommend putting the short side in the back instead of the front and wrap around the end posts in the back. this will make the gaps less noticeable, but will also create room for pacifiers to fall in a harder to reach area by the wall.",

                "reviewText": "We initially had our baby crib barren of everything but the fitted sheet (first time parents, very worried about safe sleep) and quickly learned that as soon as our baby started rolling we needed SOMETHING to stop her from getting her arm dangerously caught in the railing. We had this expedited to our home and it was an easy set up. We've had it for a few months now and it's been easy to readjust it as her crib needs changed. It's lightly padded (or kinda cushy) so if the baby rolls and sleeps against the edge im not worried about her being uncomfortable. As the baby has gotten more bold with climbing and crawling she can push this down and pull on it, but typically it poops back up to its original position.Overall I would recommend this to anyone with a baby, even if you use it just for those early months.",
