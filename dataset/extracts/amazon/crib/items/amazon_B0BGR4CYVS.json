We started setting it up in the living room and before we finished it we had to make sure it would fit down the hall and into the doorway we wanted. It didn't first so we had to take one of the sides off to get it into the room. So if you have very narrow doorways do not set it up fully until it's in the room you want it to be in.Once we got it in the room we finished the set up and it is sturdy so far. Baby won't be here for 4 more months so right now we are using it for storage of all the baby items we are collecting.We had no problems with any of our pieces or parts and the crib is a beautiful white color. I love the design of the back and how high it is.Although we have 2 kids this was our first crib purchase as we used a hand me down crib for the other two kids that my sister gave us.The price was right and amazon even gave us a small coupon of $4 off to use on it so that was nice even though it wasn't a lot.",

Got two left side panels and no right side panel, so are unable to proceed.Will try calling them this morning & see how they rectify the situation.REVISED: I called the number on the manual that came with the crib. A very nice & helpful woman took all my information and promised to send a right side panel to solve my problem. I did not have to send back the extra left panel.The part arrived as promised, was the correct part, and the crib was assembled perfectly! YAY!One final note, the back 'head board' piece arrived (in the original shipment) with a crack in it - I assume from the shipping process - but it's not real noticeable and so we just assembled the crib anyways.It's a very nice crib, attractive and seems sturdy.",
