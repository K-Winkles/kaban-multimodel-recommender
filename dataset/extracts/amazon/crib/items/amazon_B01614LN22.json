                "reviewText": "UPDATE, 1.5 years laterCrib still looks great and I actually just noticed a few parts where my son had chewed the crib. The light color of the wood actually hides chewed spots very well, which is great!! (My older daughter had a white crib and the chewed parts were very noticeable and stark)I think all of the negative reviews (minus an occasional quality issue), must be from first time parents, or complainers.The design is pretty much identical to a different Da Vinci brand crib we have as well. This one though has much nicer looking wood and feels sturdier too. I have no safety concerns whatsoever.I love that it came with the toddler rail. (The one for our Da Vinci crib was an extra $80 on top of the crib price)A crib skirt will work just fine, providing it has a slit in each corner. Ours were from pottery barn kids and worked. Just be aware it will work best when the mattress is at its highest (for a newborn) and there is the most room for a crib skirt to hang below it. Once you start lowering the mattress it won't look very good because you will only have a couple of inches for it to hang before it just lays on the floor.Delivery and packaging were fine too. Set up was ok, not super fast, but it all went together properly. Overall I would recommend this crib.",

                "reviewText": "It was quite hard to assemble! Took me an hour and a half to put together. The support that the mattress goes on was super hard to get attached. Ended up scratching part of the crib trying to get it in. It was almost like one of the holes didn't align correctly because 3 of the screws went in really easy, and one was super hard.The pieces aren't labeled well and I ended up having to take pieces apart twice, to put them together again because I put the pieces together the wrong way. I feel like it could be labeled better. Also, I wish where the screws went in weren't as visible. I've put together a lot of furniture in my time on this earth, and this is probably one of the most confusing things I've put together.Putting it together was hard, but the crib is beautiful, and I love the design, but I'm dreading the day I have to lower the mattress. Hopefully that won't be as hard.The crib seems very sturdy!",

                "reviewText": "Just finished setting our crib up, and I love it so far! Very easy assembly. I did it myself at 26wks pregnant in about 30 min. I love that it\u2019s solid wood, and specifically appreciate that the light stain on the wood has been tested to be safe. I spent a lot of time researching and reading reviews on other cribs and brands that had issues with paint smells and harmful chemicals, and was happy to spend a little more money on this crib, knowing it will be safe for our babe. As far as the color of the \u201cnatural\u201d color, I don\u2019t see a pink hue to it, as other reviewers have mentioned. You can see the natural color of the wood underneath the stain that is a very light wood with some greys to it, and the stain creates more of a white wash finish, but is still a natural beige. I love the color!",

                "reviewText": "COMPLETELY IN LOVE WITH THIS CRIB!! It is so beautiful, pictures honestly do not do it justice! If you are looking for minimalistic - search no further! The color of wood is very light in person, imo a smidge lighter than the pictures. But that was cool with me. I think it\u2019s perfect. Love that is has circular pegs instead of traditional squared ones (for safety reasons). It is completely level at the top which is also a bonus safety feature. My only gripe - and I\u2019m nit-picking here - is the directions. No words, just diagrams lol. If you\u2019re a visual learner that\u2019s probably okay for you. But I struggled a bit and ended up putting the end pieces on backwards and had to disassemble, and reassemble - even with looking at the directions thoroughly beforehand and thinking I had matched the pictures correctly. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It didn\u2019t bother me too much, my husband helped when I got stuck. Definitely a two person assembly. But other than vague directions - the crib is flipping beautiful!! Wish I could explain how perfect it is. Incredibly smooth, light neutral wood tone with white legs will complete any nursery theme you\u2019ve picked out. Seriously. Love love love! Couldn\u2019t love it more.",
