                "reviewText": "I loved this diaper caddy and wish it would\u2019ve worked for the playard I have. Unfortunately I had to send it back since it\u2019s too long and drags on the floor, but it was able to fit maybe 3-4 days worth of diapers, day and night lotion, a big tub of butt paste, brush, nose picker and nail clippers, as well as some toys, extra pacifiers, day & night gripe water, Tylenol and the syringes. It was very sturdy even before putting all these items in, and stayed sturdy afterwards. I had ordered this for a gray playard I ended up returning due to issues with the item, but when I had this caddy hanging from that one it looked great and meshed so well with it. Definitely worth the money in my opinion",

If you want this for the side of a dresser like I did, you need to install hooks. I used command strips. Definitely a must for vertical storage. I also put burp cloths, bibs, and extra changing table pads in the little pockets. The only down side is that I wish the side compartments/pockets were a bit bigger.",

I was not sure exactly where I was going to use it. it can hang on a wall, door, dresser or table, crib or bed. Very versatile. The cubbies do not sag or lose the \"boxiness\". It's not going to hold a bunch of diapers or inserts or clothes, but it holds enough until the next wash day, except maybe for diapers. I use it on the end of the crib for nighttime feeding and changing (the crib is next to my bed). I have burp clothes, wipes, sometimes a bottle, pacifiers, a few diapers and inserts, diaper cream, my digital thermometer and aspirator, a diaper pad, and a few changes of clothes. It's kind of like a diaper bag but easier to access. Also good if you have an upstairs or downstairs where you move the baby for a while, since this can hang on a playpen or pack-n-play. I recommend and would buy again.",
