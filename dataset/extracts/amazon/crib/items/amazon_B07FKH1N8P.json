                "reviewText": "I'm the sort of guy that, when I dismantle some flatpack furniture, always leave all the fixings in a little plastic bag and masking tape it to part of the pack. So you can imagine my distress, when I retrieved the parts of an old Billy bookcase from the garage, not to be able to find said fixings. I had promised my son to put it in his room. However, this pack of screws saved me. A great assortment and included just what I needed for the Billy. Jobs are never straightforward, however, and I discovered that most of the dowels were missing too :-( Fortunately, I had previously bought a box of mixed dowels (these ones: https://amzn.to/3Hx3mWy) - hurrah I thought. Problem solved. Except the right diameter dowels were the wrong size. After fiddling about with a junior hacksaw for 10 minutes I decided it was time for the power tools. An experiment with a chop saw went just as well as you might expect - with bits of dowel flying off at great speed. But then I had a revelation, and managed to set up a little jig to help me use my new Bandsaw to chop them down. Which is a long way of saying this was a good buy - and I've plenty more which might encourage me to make something else with some of them.",
