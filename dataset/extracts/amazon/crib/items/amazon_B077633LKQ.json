I was skeptical at first buying the furniture online without being able to see the color and quality in person. It won\u2019t disappoint for the price. It is much better quality then furniture that you have to assemble. All of the Evolur furniture comes pre assembled. The crib does come in pieces though because it has to since it is a 5 in 1 convertible crib/bed. Very easy to put together in less than 10 minutes. It\u2019s the best quality furniture that you are going to get these days without spending thousands at a high end furniture store.",

I checked out all the typical baby stores that would carry it before I found it on Amazon. Let me say, I am very leery of furniture delivery for nursery furniture. My first crib for my first child was a nightmare (broken headboard, long delays, poor customer service). After comparing all my options, Amazon had the best prices and delivery windows.The breakdown.1. The crib is beautiful. My mother even went gaga for it.2. Delivery was insanely fast for furniture. I think I placed the order on a Wednesday/Thursday, and we had it delivered by Saturday. My other options were giving me 1-2 week windows.While I was super nervous to order the crib off of Amazon, I was super impressed with quality and delivery.",

The color is definitely more beige than gray and lighter. Not as gray as I was expecting but nonetheless it\u2019s beautiful! The second picture shows the actual color and the remaining pics is the tone it looks like with natural sunlight. It is Sturdy, and super quick to assemble.

Evolur is a a Legit company out of New Jersey with their own website where you can find extra parts and matching pieces to this collection. I went on their website and requested a few swatches be sent to me that came a couple days later to help chose the color. The crib is beautiful and was very easy to put together- it took about 30 minutes to put together with very easy directions and tools. I found many of this company\u2019s collections to be beautiful but the \u201cMadison\u201d collection seemed right for us at our price point. I would Definitely recommend this crib or any product from Evolur.",
