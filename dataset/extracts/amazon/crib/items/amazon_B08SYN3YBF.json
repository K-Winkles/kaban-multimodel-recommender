                "reviewText": "The bad itself is great! However, the paint has rubbed off and started chipping for places we frequently touch. It's been about 3 months since our baby has been sleeping in it but nearly 7 months we've been using it for the changing table.Also, the changing table is very small. My 6 and a half month old baby is in the 50% percentile for height--so very very average height for his age--and he's basically outgrown it in length. I find myself pulling him up to where his little legs just dangle off the front railing while I change him so he doesn't get his foot stuck in the gap.All in all though, it's a cute bed and seems pretty sturdy and wasn't that hard to put up.",
