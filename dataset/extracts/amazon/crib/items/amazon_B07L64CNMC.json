                "reviewText": "This crib is gorgeous and so versatile! We are getting licensed to be foster parents and we need furniture that can be suitable for any age 0-8. That can be tricky when you live in a smaller space like ours but this crib is perfect for us. If we need a crib or toddler bed, we\u2019re all set in one and if we have an older child who wants to sleep in a twin, this can easily become a play house and stay in the bedroom. Even if you aren\u2019t fostering, this crib is perfect for all of your child\u2019s transitions. It seems durable enough to convert back and forth as many times as you need so it\u2019s definitely built to last. Standard crib mattress fits perfectly (we got the Graco mattress in a box.)Here are some things I love so far: The crib came well-packaged and well-protected with all parts and hardware marked. There are different sets of screws for the different set ups, so I highly recommend grabbing a few zip lock bags and sorting and labeling each one before you begin. (See pic.) We assembled the crib and changed it to a toddler bed and assembly is great with easy to follow directions! For assembly, it definitely helps to have two people. The pictures in the directions are detailed and show the labels and holes if you need help figuring out the orientation of the pieces. There are also labels that show which side goes down (see pic). For each setup, there will be pieces left over for the other setups so don\u2019t worry that you missed something! Before we purchased the crib, we emailed back and forth with customer service and they are personal, friendly and quick to reply! Answered all our questions and encouraged us to always feel free to reach out for help; that was a big deal to me because my husband and I didn\u2019t know anything about cribs and needed some reassurance. Overall this has been a wonderful experience and we\u2019re so in love \ud83d\ude0d",

                "reviewText": "The crib itself is nice, big, and generally well constructed. It was easy to assemble and feels very sturdy.However, I have two main problems with the crib.1) The packaging was laughably inadequate. The parts were basically thrown into a box with a couple of small styrofoam pieces. It was admittedly treated roughly by the delivery company, but if it was packaged with some care then there would have been no damage. My crib was dinged in quite a few places, and the joints in one piece had loosened a bit, but was no real problem as it is reinforced by another piece upon construction.2) The crib has a strong chemical smell from the factory! It was rather overwhelming at first, filling any room or hall you put it in. After over a month of airing out in a large hallway, and spending at least a week in the sun, it finally has a reasonable level of odor. You can still smell it if you put your nose right up to the \"wood\" (melamine covered particle board, or something), but the scent is no longer detectable otherwise.A crib has a lot of parts and assembly, so I can't expect something amazing for ~$300, but I was quite disappointed in the packaging and, most importantly, the smell this crib comes with. I was specifically searching for a crib that didn't smell (it seems to be a rather common problem), but failed. If you have a month or two to air the crib out then it is a good buy.Another minus: I had to drill out two of the holes, as some particle board had broken into them. Another blow to the quality, but for the price range I think it is par for the course, and maybe even fair to expect. So I wasn't really bothered by it.Overall a good crib, though if I could find one that didn't smell for a month I would have purchased that one instead.",
