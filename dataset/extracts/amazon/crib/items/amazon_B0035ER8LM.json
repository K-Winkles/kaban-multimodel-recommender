                "reviewText": "I was a little nervous about this purchase, based on the negative reviews, but it is a surprisingly sturdy, roomy, and well-made crib. All the hardware was sorted into blister packs on a cardboard backing and nothing was missing. The pre-drilled holes were mostly spot on - one pair was a little crooked, but there is no effect on functionality or safety. The finish is perfect. Where the two ugly stickers were on the side panels, furniture polish took off any sticky residue left after removal. The base is extremely sturdy and has two settings - a higher one for younger infants who can't roll over or push up, and a lower one for older babies. At the lower setting, it rests on a sturdy bar, but on the higher setting, it rests on just two plastic pegs. There are, however, latches under the board that slide into holes at both levels to lock it in place, so I don't anticipate having any trouble with it moving or collapsing. The thin foam mattress included would probably be fine, as I also use a lambskin for my babies, but I did get the three-inch coil spring mattress. It's a little thicker than recommended, but I'm not concerned about it. I also have a full-sized crib currently in use by my toddler, and I expect she'll be moved into a bed long before baby gets big enough to climb out of this one,My two year old tested this out for me. She's quite tall for her age and weighs about 35 pounds. The crib remained sturdy and stable in spite of her antics, but I think it would be possible for her to climb out or lean far enough over the rail to flip out, so keep that in mind if using it with an older baby. Even at her age and height, she wasn't crowded in this, which makes me wonder why ordinary cribs are so large! I also like that it folds up for storage later. It's not terribly compact, not like a pack-n-play, say, but it can be stowed in a larger closet or even under a bed.This is a beautiful, sturdy, and space-efficient option.",

It's super easy to assemble and is a lifesaver when our son and his family are visiting. We did order a separate thicker mattress as the one that comes with it is very thin.",

                "reviewText": "Update 10/19/2021:The crib is still in good condition with regular use. Some teeth marks here and there, so I'm happy we went with Espresso. We took it on vacation recently and the ease to fold up and store in the car was perfect; exactly what I was hoping for. Much better option than using a provided crib at a hotel or rental property.I was worried about the weight capacity for this crib and the longevity of it, but I have no fears. As it is sidecar to the master bed, the 80lb dog lays in it and there have been no repercussions. I don't advise doing your own test, but let's say the safety factor on this crib is pretty darn good.Original:The hardware packaging was received damaged, so we received no washers, missing nut, and broken wheel. Oddly the instructions received to assemble the crib are not the same as those listed in the description pdf. The instructions received don't call for the washers so hopefully everything will be ok. We will need to replace the nut which is not as bad as trying to repair a broken wheel.The crib pieces themselves are very nice quality. One of them does have a smell but this should fade with time. And I already planned to use a better mattress than what was received with the crib.Overall pretty good for there price despite the inconvenience.",

                "reviewText": "Our daughter's nursery doubles as a guest room (with sleeper sofa) so we didn't want a large, traditional, crib. Instead, I was looking for something that had clean lines and was very practical for her and us when friends/family came to visit but stayed in the room. She's now 6 months old (15 lbs and 25 3/4 inches long) so it was definitely time for her to move beyond sleeping in the bassinet and make the transition to sleeping in a crib.Living in a condo, we are always thinking about ways to maximize storage and save space. The fact that this crib could be rolled from the guest room/nursery, into our bedroom at night to ease the transition for our daughter was a HUGE ADVANTAGE. As for it's size, it's spacious in my opinion and should last her into early toddlerhood (2 - 2 and 1/2 years old perhaps). But, by then...she'll be making yet another transition to a toddler bed and we can simply fold this crib and pack it away until baby #2 needs to use it :) Right now, it's perfect for her and is a little longer than two and 1/2 standard size pillows placed side by side. I've included some pictures to give you an idea of the crib's length and width using household items (two pillows)--sometimes that's a better visual than just reading dimensions.Initially, we had the crib/mattress on the higher setting simply because we though about putting some cute storage bins underneath. There was plenty of room for that. But, suddenly we realized our daughter began to get curious and pull up against the sides to look over the rail! At 6 months old, she is SO MUCH MORE MOBILE than other babies her age. Seeing this, we quickly lowered it to the next (and lower) height. The pictures show the higher height though. The crib is sturdy and well made and we couldn't be happier with this purchase.",
