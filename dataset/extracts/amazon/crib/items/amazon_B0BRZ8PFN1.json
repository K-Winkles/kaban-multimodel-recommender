Not a super huge fan of the music but that\u2019s okay I have a Hatch sound system anyways but the night light comes in handy! This is my first baby I haven\u2019t co slept but I love that I can still have her next to me just not in my bed lol. It\u2019s holding up well despite my 2 year old thinking she can sleepy in it. 10/10 still recommend. \ud83d\udc4dI\u2019m getting induced tommorow so I\u2019ll update my review after I have the baby HOWEVER, this was super easy to put together 8 months and very pregnant. There\u2019s good space, I love how it\u2019ll grow with baby. It\u2019s def a little bulkier than a normal bassinet but it\u2019s not too big. Still smaller than a regular size crib. Feels sturdy and good material. Rolling around is easy even on carpet! I\u2019m very excited for this item. :)",

We already have a bassinet at home but were tired of having to unassemble it and bring the bassinet with us when we went to visit. This was easy to set up and we like that it has rollers in case we need to switch rooms for some reason or my parents can roll it into the closet when someone else stays. None of my kids have been fans of the music parts of any bassinets we have had so I don't forsee that being used.",

Every new parent is concerned with how to keep your child close to you at night without having to take up too much space in your room, or risk having the child sleep in bed with you. This device grows with your child and lets you have multiple options to meet the sleep style that is the most beneficial for you. As a father of three, this is a great product and one that I wish I had with all of my children. Whether you are a first time parent or have been a parent for a while, this is an excellent option for giving your kids a rest. The build quality of it is strong and you do not have to worry about it putting your child in danger. Overall, I recommend this product!",

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t like how the wheels stick out, I trip over them and accidentally lock the breaks ALL. THE. TIME. The height adjustment system is very clunky, not user friendly, and the sides don\u2019t go up and down simultaneously easily. It\u2019s hard to tell where each level is and when you let go of the handles, it clunks down, hard to the lower level if you don\u2019t have it high enough for the upper level. I don\u2019t like the fitted sheet because it stains very easily. Also the Velcro straps make it very difficult to find other fitted sheets to fit it without having to put eyelets in to accommodate the Velcro, or just leave the Velcro undone. I like the side that zips down, would like it on both sides. I do not like how it\u2019s hard to undo the side so I just leave it down all the time at this point since my child can\u2019t roll over or move freely yet. I like how big the mention is to have baby stay in it for longer, instead of having to switch to a crib.",
