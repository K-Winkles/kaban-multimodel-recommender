I sort of wish the shelving area came with a flip door to eliminate dust gathering on the shelves near the pampers. For now we just keep them in big clear baggies once we take them out of the box/bag. The changing tray is sturdy. A large crib would have been too much and this works fine and can even turn into a toddler bed like some larger cribs. Perfect adj mattress level. She is a preemie so she will get great use out of this crib!!",
