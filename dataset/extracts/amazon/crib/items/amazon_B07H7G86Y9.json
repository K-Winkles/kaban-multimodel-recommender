                "reviewText": "This product is slightly on the expensive side but we like that it is the perfect length for a twin bed. Another reason we chose this product is because it can be easily folded down, allowing me to climb on the bed with him for his bedtime story. The installation was simple, though the instructions seemed to show an extra part... possibly for an extra long version? Anyways, it was easy to figure out.We installed this on a metal frame bed. It was tricky getting it to stay in place, but we used command picture frame hangers (the velcro-like ones) and it worked like a charm! I think it would work best on a wooden slate bed that can be drilled into, but our hack has worked so far without any problems. There is a rope structure that you can strap to the other side of the bed and that alone would not be enough to keep the product in place. Our bed is a twin so we had a lot of leftover rope but this means this product can also be used on a queen bed.Overall, this product does what it\u2019s supposed to and folds down easily. The metal bars are padded and feel strong. I\u2019m not sure what would happen if my son directly fell on top of it, but I don\u2019t think there would be a problem. The only downside is that the folded down part is raised from the actual mattress bottom so making the bed can get a little tricky since you have to tuck it into the side but it\u2019s a minor problem. I would rather have a hard time making the bed than to risk having this fall off the side and my child injuring himself.",

Love this thing!..but only bc I sleep with my toddler sometimes and it keeps my big azz in the bed when she\u2019s a very active sleeper lol.It\u2019s very high! I didn\u2019t realize how high, until I attached it to the twin bed. The length is perfect. The height is a dramatic. Especially if you have a narrow mattress (mine is 8\u201d).Parts are thick. Width of the section fitting into the side of the bed frame is quite thick so changing the sheets is very cumbersome. I have to struggle to set the mattress free from being trapped in the railing.It\u2019s sturdy. Once up, stays up even while toddler pulls and leans all her weight on it.Setting back down is tough since you have to press the buttons on each end of this very wide guard. So be prepared for that.Still happy with it. It\u2019s pleasant to the eye, stays in place (all suggested attachment steps were followed).",

I have a really thick mattress, but the gate reaches high enough to do it\u2019s job. Despite the mattress being really heavy, the gate does slide out too easily when pushed directly. It does come with hardware to fasten it to the box spring however.",

                "reviewText": "We were looking for something to put in our top camper bunk for our 3 year old as our 1 year old needed to be in the bottom bunk (in a pack in play). This rail worked perfectly. I was able to screw it to the bunk frame to keep it secure. The fold down feature allowed us to put our 3 year old in the bunk for bed and close it so there wasn't a chance of falling out. Our child likes to move around a lot in bed. If the measurements fit your bunk opening, don't hesitate this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "First - I own two of these products. A 43 inch and 51 inch bed rail. If installed properly, this product is very sturdy and easy to use. My kids are safe and no problems at all.Second, in ordering another product of the same size, I was shipped a 59 inch product that someone put a 43 inch sticker on. This happened twice. I called Amazon and Amazon said they\u2019d put the product on hold. But I contacted the seller and this was the best method. The seller offered me $20 for the inconvenience, which was in addition to Amazon fully refunding my purchase. So I recommend the product and recommend the company as well. I would definitely buy from this company again, which I did. I ordered a 51 inch bed rail and everything was good. Thanks",
