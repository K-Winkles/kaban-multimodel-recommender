Luckily if there are any dings over time, I\u2019m sure you could easily use a black furniture marker to cover those dings. It was fairly easy to assemble. My husband and 9 year old boy had it built within 35-45 mins and that was with a Euro Great Dane very interested the entire time, meaning in the way. Lol. I\u2019d definitely recommend to anyone with a smaller size nursery like ours. We converted our good size walk in closet to our baby girls nursery and this was the perfect fit for the area we wanted her crib to be in. We have so much room for everything else while she still has a good size bed!",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this crib and the price I paid for it! It was shipped within a week from ordering. It came packaged well and all the screws and tools were there. Only thing is, I really wish they had better visuals of which screws is which. I really struggled with this and had to change out the screws. It took me almost two hours to assemble. Also, I was being too fast and put all four sides on before putting the board in. You need to leave one long side rail open and install the board then put the last side rail on. Now, if you know your measurements (fractions) by heart or have a measuring tape or hand, then you should be good to go at identifying which correct screws to use. I had a measuring tape and still struggled! I couldn't get myself together. I was getting tired. After, looking at the paper for about 15 minutes and looking at the parts, I was like \"Ohhhhh, I see! \" LOL!! I had to laugh at myself.Lastly, I pre-measured the space and it was supposed to fit good without being to snug. It was pretty snug but I do not care! I'm so overjoyed with my purchase. Oh and please be advised you will need to buy a 3 inch mattress. That little piece of mess they give you is not going to cut it! I know what the package says about not having a mattress over 2 inches but I can't find any mini crib mattress that's 2 inches so, I'm okay with buying one that is three inches.Over all I gave them 4 stars. I think the directions for assembly could have more detailed but everything else I'm satisfied with. I new from reading the reviews that mattress would need to be replace so I'm not counting that in tis review. Great value for your money, from a great name brand! I would most definitely, purchase again from this seller and brand.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this in December 2019 for my now-ten-month-old. We have an older child who, at over two years old, still slept in a tiny corner of his standard sized crib and still loved his pack n play when we traveled. So we felt confident that a mini crib would work well and was perfect for our smaller nursery.Initially, I was disappointed by the lightweight feel of everything upon unboxing. I had been hoping for something as sturdy feeling as a standard crib. The side rail pieces feel flimsier and lighter than that. But, the mattress support piece is a solid board and adds the necessary weight to make this a safe piece of furniture. There were some areas where the finish wasn\u2019t complete or perfect, along with some scratches, dents, and chips. None was overly noticeable on the \u201cnatural\u201d wood finish, and I haven\u2019t noticed them since putting the crib together. This looks beautiful in our space and I\u2019m happy with it overall.HOWEVER! I have one huge complaint. Knowing this was going to be a full-time bed for my baby for hopefully two years, I decided to buy a proper mattress right away. Honestly, the one it came with had all the potential of working fine. It seems really similar to pack n play mattresses, which, as I\u2019ve said, my two-year-old still slept fine on when traveling. But my older son is a terrible sleeper, and I knew if my second baby was having trouble, the first thing I would question was the mattress. And I knew I would spend approximately $1 billion in 2am Amazon purchases hoping to solve my baby\u2019s sleep problems. So, good mattress from the get-go. The problem: nowhere, on Amazon\u2019s product description, Dream On Me\u2019s website, or any other product description I read, did it state that:THERE IS A TWO INCH MAXIMUM HEIGHT FOR ANY MATTRESS USED WITH THIS CRIB.This is clearly stated in huge letters on the outside of the box and is essential information for purchasers! I ordered a five-inch mattress at the same time as the crib and was unable to return it. The reason for this limit is immediately obvious - a taller mattress is unsafe because it raises baby too close to the top of the rails and creates a fall hazard. At first, we were able to simply use a lower setting since the height is adjustable. Now that my daughter is ten months old, the mattress is on its lowest height. As soon as she starts to pull herself to standing (most babies already can at ten months) she will be way too high up on the rails to be safe. Even at 50th percentile height, it\u2019s clear she\u2019ll be too tall.Unfortunately, though my husband is quite handy, I don\u2019t think we will even be able to adapt the crib by drilling new, lower holes to lower the mattress because of how the mattress support board is secured and the location of the joints and additional pre-drilled holes that are only used for the other non-crib configurations (see my photos.) Drilling new holes also is unlikely to work because it\u2019s likely to create a pinch hazard between the top of the mattress and the bottom of the rails, especially since the horizontal rails curve. Not to mention adapting a crib frame is inherently unwise since it\u2019s not safety tested.So, when my baby starts standing any day now, I\u2019ll have to either ditch the nice mattress I bought and put the flimsy one in (my baby is likely to be pretty mad about that since she\u2019s used to a much better standard) or ditch this crib. Super bummer, since both were equally expensive. Definitely avoidable if there had been proper information in the product description.",
