                "reviewText": "I'm a third-time mom so I know a thing or two about what's really needed in a bassinet. And after searching... and searching... and searching... for a co-sleeping bassinet that had 360 degrees of just breathable mesh (no fabric to suffocate on) with wheels and that folded down compactly for storage I FINALLY found this gem. The design could not be better. My kids start rolling onto their sides almost immediately as newborns so mesh sides were a must for me. Most bedside bassinets have tons of fabric on the sides where babies could press their faces up against, which I do not think is safe. I was really hesitant to buy from a brand I hadn't heard about on Amazon, especially one without a ton of reviews but this thing is seriously amazing. I used to have the halo bassinet and I hated it. It was too small, the sheets were expensive, the mattress was hard as a rock, it wasn't an even level sleeping surface, and it was hard to push down on the side to get the baby postpartum. This bassinet is extremely sturdy, can attach to my bed if I want it to, has the drop-down side to make it easy to pick up baby in the middle of the night without using my non-existent painful core muscles. The mattress is firm which baby needs but feels much more comfortable and soft in the best way possible while still being safe, the sleeping area is HUGE I can fit my Snuggle Me Organic (organic doc-a-tot) in it easily (which I couldn't do in my halo bassinet). Not only that but it comes with these awesome bonus hooks to hang burp cloths or pacifiers on the side or whatever you want for easy access, a cute mobile, 4 sheets, a diaper caddy, and the whole thing transitions into a deeper crib for when baby is past 5 months old. With most bassinets, you only get 3-5 months out of it before you have to put them in something deeper like a crib or pack-n-play, but this gem lets me lower the bottom so I can use it for a year in my room! It's smaller than a pack-n-play too so I'm super excited to have a more compact long-term baby product for once. I also love that I can wheel it to the living room for a safe sleep area and play area out there so my other toddlers can see the baby but have a nice safe barrier between them. And honestly for the price, IDK how this isn't the number one seller on Amazon but it probably will be soon. Take my advice and buy this one!P.S. If you want some sheets for it in addition to the 4 it comes with, I highly recommend the Nodnal Co. sheet sets. They fit the mattress on this bassinet perfectly and how cute are they (see my review photo for a preview)!

                "reviewText": "This is the most sturdy, well designed bassinet I have ever seen!! I bought it for my first grandbaby, and I've been more & more impressed with the features & quality of this bassinet!! It is the perfect size to roll from the bedroom to living room in an apartment. It was really easy to put together, folds easily for travel. It has easily adjustable heights & you can elevate either end.The mobile that comes with it has 3 cute toys hanging and has a little light the baby can look at (rotates shapes & colors). The piece that holds the mobile is a little hard to get on the first time, it has 2 vibration settings, 3 levels of lullaby music sound, a light for checking on baby & you can turn the mobile on or off. It came with a very nice adjustable wipes & diaper caddy. The bassinet bottom mattress is very sturdy!! It has a zip on sheet (5 zippered sheets included), which are very nice, however I bought bassinet size, waterproof mattress pads & sheets to make it easier for my daughter to change the bedding. It came with 3 additional clips for hanging whatever you'll need at hand. We used them to hang a blanket on one side to block baby from looking at the TV as a newborn. The mattress size is 34\" long 19 1/2\" wide.",

                "reviewText": "i love this bassinet! planning for a baby is overwhelming. i searched for months for something that i thought would be perfect & this is it. i was so worried that i would be disappointed with this bassinet because it almost seemed too good to be true. that is not the case with this bassinet. the bassinet was so easy to assemble that i was able to do it all by myself at 8 months pregnant. i put it together early as i was worried that i would deliver early so it sat in our living room while we finished renovations for about 2 weeks until we moved it into our room. moving it was very easy because of the wheels on the bottom. i was worried that the bassinet would be too small since most bassinets are pretty compact but this one is very roomy. the bassinet is very sturdy, we have a pitbull that gets very excited about going outside or sniffing baby sister so he has bumped into it a few times but if barely moves. m the mattress on the bassinet is a little firm but i was able to tuck a blanket into it to make it more comfortable & my baby loves it. my baby loves looking at the mobile while it\u2019s moving above her. baby is calmed by the music it plays at 3 different levels & the vibration of the bassinet. the nightlight has been very helpful for late night diaper changes. i love love love the mesh siding so i can see her when she isn\u2019t next to my bed & i love the fact that it has a side that can be tucked down to meet the edge of my bed even more! overall this has been my favorite purchase for our baby. if you are looking for something that has all the works at a reasonable price then look no further!!",

                "reviewText": "I love this bassinet. Wish I had it when my daughter was a newborn, I love the height. At the highest setting it is level with my bed. Very sturdy and well made. I'm not sure it's big enough to fit up to a 1 year old as advertised though. I bought when my daughter was about 4 months and at almost 8 months she has little room length wise so I switched her to a pack n play. I packed up this bassinet for baby #2 and it was super easy to store away. I would still recommend it, even if I only used for a few months but I do wish I got more months out of it. Overall 8/10",
