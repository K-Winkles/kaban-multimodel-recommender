SO SPACIOUS. I would recommend two people for the assembly part and to really pay attention to the instructions, but other than that? Had no problem with it. Will definitely buy a second one for my other child.",

                "reviewText": "We didn\u2019t open this for about a month. Ordered white but received dove gray. Too late to return and disappointed but not a show stopper. The crib was easy to assemble. Standard crib mattress fits nice and snug.It isn\u2019t used for naps or even every night. Baby is not left in crib for extended period of time. I\u2019d say on average, this is a lightly used crib. Our baby has 4 teeth and in a matter of a couple of weeks we started seeing scratches - even when he only had two teeth. In just a few short months, it looks like in the photo. The rail is full of ugly scratches. Completely disappointing purchase.",
