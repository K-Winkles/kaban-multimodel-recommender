The only area where I needed human hands was that I had my husband bring up the box and had his help installing the mattress support. You definitely want to have help on that so that things don't get bent or broken.. although this seems sturdy and well-made enough that I don't think that would necessarily happen.One more thing to note- I loooove that there are no screw holes visible on the outside. I've seen other cribs that they didn't provide caps for the screws. However, they could have provided caps for when you adjust the mattress later.",

It fit perfect in our room next to our bed so we don\u2019t have to go far to change our baby. It\u2019s also the right height where you aren\u2019t bending down and hurting your back. I\u2019m considering purchasing another one for our living room!",

The wheels require more effort to lock, which is inconvenient, but other than that, it can fit a lot! I use it as a fancy changing table in the 2nd floor, since my other changing table is in the 3rd floor. I may buy the other one in black for the 1st floor just so I don't have to keep going up and down the stairs to change my baby.",
