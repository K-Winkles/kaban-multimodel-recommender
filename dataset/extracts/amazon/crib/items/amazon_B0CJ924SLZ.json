                "reviewText": "We bought four of the large extended versions for our two toddlers transitioning from their cribs to twin beds. We bought them planning for the transition in a few weeks. But when the kids started climbing out of their cribs, we had to move fast to put the bed and bed rails together before bedtime one night.I had spent hours researching toddler bed rails online because we have platform twin beds with wood slats holding up the mattress, but no box spring. SO MANY of these bed rails DO NOT WORK WITH PLATFORM BEDS and especially with slats. THESE RAILS DO WORK WITH PLATFORM BEDS with slats or plywood bases and they come with the necessary parts for each type.From my research, I found out that many bed rails are not able to sit on the platform (whether they are solid plywood or slats) and still reach above the edge of the bed frame so they can fold down. And, many bed rails are not able to fasten correctly to a platform, either. THIS MODEL WORKS PERFECTLY with our platform bed with slats and folds up and down perfectly. It is strong enough to hold our 2 1/2 year olds when they are pushing on the rails.PLEASE WATCH THE ONLINE INSTRUCTIONS!!! The instruction book that comes with is very confusing and the pictures are all very close up so you can't tell what parts they are trying to show you. Also if you ordered this EXTENDED version, NEITHER THE BOOK NOR THE ONLINE VIDEO SHOWS WHAT TO DO WITH THE EXTENSION PART. I saw so many reviews here that said the mesh was too big for the rails and there was an extra piece left over. Well, duh, that's the extension piece meant to fit the extra long mesh. Please read the comments and understand the extra piece is meant to go in between the shorter ends so it extends all the way out and the mesh fits over the whole frame.Otherwise, these were very easy to put together after watching the video. We initially installed them with the velcro on the slats, but for other reasons, we added a piece of plywood over the slats (because there was a large gap at the head and end of the bed all the way to the ground where the kids could get stuck). We then screwed the bed rail supports into the plywood, making sure the screws didn't protrude through the plywood - because you know kids will crawl under their beds...Finally, because these are so long, it's hard to release the locks and fold them down with both hands at the same time. I can't reach all the way from one end to the other at all. So, my trick is to: 1) Unlock one end; 2) Pull it toward you so it doesn't re-lock; 3) Keep holding the rail and then slide your hand down toward the other end, pulling the rail toward you a bit so the first end doesn't re-lock; 4) When you get to the other end, keep pulling it toward you a bit and unlock the second end. The whole bed rail should then release and fold down easily. I have done this many times and even one-handed with a baby in one arm. On our small twin beds, the rails fold all the way down so they're parallel with the side of the bed. They don't stick out at all when folded down.Good luck!",

                "reviewText": "The product came quickly and was easy to assemble. It looks very nice and the structure feels very sturdy once all the pieces are in place. It has a smaller profile than some of the similar guard rails on the market, which is why we ordered it. However, I will say that I was a little disappointed with a couple of things. First, the description of the item leads you to believe that this will work on just about any type of bed and situation. It lists convertible crib in the title, but I can assure you that the anchor straps provided DO NOT work with a toddler sized mattress. The straps are adjustable (and oddly come in a hideous cream color, which is weird since everything else is bright white, but doesn't really matter because it's hidden under the mattress anyway), but even at their shortest length are probably only for a twin bed. I believe what the manufacturer wants is for you to not use these straps with toddler bed, but rather velcro the metal legs of the structure to the springs of crib/toddler bed. This does not work for us since we have a dust ruffle over top the springs, but more importantly didn't feel that solution alone would adequately secure the guard rail. What's frustrating here is that all the manufacturer needs to do is allow the cream straps to adjust to the width of a toddler bed...problem solved. The second problem is that the guard rail is under UNBELIEVABLE tension when in the locked position. DO NOT plan on one person being able to easily lower the rail. Maybe that changes over time as the fabric relaxes a little. But I am a strong guy with a 6'5\" wingspan and I couldn't drop the rail down without using my chest to lower it while my hands lifted the locks. The first time I used it, the rail slipped off my chest when it was halfway down (45 degrees) and had so much tension that it whipped up a hit me in the chin, causing me to bite my tongue and leaving a bruise on my jaw bone. I guess the takeaway there is always plan on it being a two person job.Once it is lowered, the tension releases completely. I understand some tension is necessary to keep the entire structure rigid, but it shouldn't be so much that it is essentially a loaded catapult when upright. Again, this leads me to believe this was not really designed with a toddler bed in mind, as the toddler bed scenario is when the lowering function is most likely to be frequently used.",
