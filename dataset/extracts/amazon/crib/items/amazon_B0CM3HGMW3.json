                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019m not usually one to write a long review but this bassinet has so many good features it\u2019s hard to give it a fair review without taking some time. To start, it arrived in a timely manner and was packed well. I always worry about these two things when I order a larger sized item. Next, for something with so many additional functions it was very compact. It\u2019s a portable bed, changing table, wind up hanging mobile, and has an add on changing supply bar for the end next to the changing table but it was all contained in a rectangular column that was about hip level and only ten inches or so across. It was all all snugged into a heavy duty duffle type of carrying case so that was nice. Once I unzipped the bag and started to remove and assemble the bed I realized it was mostly assembled already and just needed to be expanded and the joints locked, awesome! And it came with an actual usable manual! So, the mattress was the first thing to assemble and this thing is no joke. Seriously. The last bassinet I bought had a terrible thin folding mattress that bowed, it felt like plastic covered cardboard but this one is thick, hard, connected panels. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s well padded so it will be comfortable but it\u2019s so much more sturdy than I expected. It also has a very pretty quilted mattress cover that fastens securely to the back of the bed surface with Velcro so it can\u2019t come off while your baby is sleeping or playing. I made a point to show that in the video because I\u2019ve not seen this before on a portable crib. It\u2019s impressive to me because it secures not only the quilted \u201csheet\u201d you could call it, but also secures the mattress to the structure of the bed. It seems like it will be a lot more safe than the usual loose mattress and that makes me feel more comfortable. For the next feature that I love, that would be the changing table. It shows it as something that goes over the frame, over the top of the bed, and it does. I like the convenience of not having to bend over into the bassinet to change a diaper! It\u2019s right up at a convenient and comfortable height and clamps really tightly to the top frame with angled sides that kind of flare up and out to give a good wide and secure surface. No wriggling baby rolling off the side! The supply attachment has a couple of round holders and a small tray area as well as a compartment for diapers. It hooks over the side like the changing table so you can have everything handy. The extras that I think I would\u2019ve been something not expected with a bassinet are the musical mobile(very cute and it plays music and turns) and the blackout cover. Honestly, I\u2019ve never heard of a blackout cover before but I can\u2019t imagine why they don\u2019t come with every portable crib. It slips over the whole bed and has zippered openings where you need them for both the low and high mattress position. It\u2019s opaque so it blocks the light but it also will keep drafts, outdoor pests, etc. away from your baby and make it cozy and dark for sleeping. The more technical stuff - the material is attractive, durable, and the zippers are high quality and I believe they\u2019re going to stand up to use. The framework is also of a durable size and configuration. The bedside height has a whole separate framework to support the mattress safely. I don\u2019t see this sagging any time soon. All in all, I expect to get a lot of good use from this bassinet and enjoy having it in my home.",

                "reviewText": "I acquired this mostly for travel and at my parents place as I wanted to avoid getting a bassinet that would end up serving as an expensive laundry hamper. I use the bassinet for daytime naps, and at night, my baby sleeps in the mini crib right beside our bed. One of the advantages is that it comes with a separate bassinet storage/travel bag, which is incredibly handy for packing up when we spend the day with family and need a safe nap space for our little one.The built-in changing table has been a lifesaver for nighttime diaper changes and when my parents are over. I keep all the essentials in the side storage, and we place blankets on the changing pad. Cleaning it is a breeze \u2013 a simple wipe down if you opt not to use blankets like we do.My favorite feature of this Pack N' Play is the mini crib. It cradles the baby securely and has a slight rocking motion that mimics a structured hammock. This gentle movement is perfect for babies who enjoy it, like mine. The padding in both the bassinet and mini crib is soft yet adequately firm for newborns. I never felt the need to add an extra mattress to either of them. We keep the changing table attached to the Pack N' Play and simply lay the baby down on the other side. We plan to transition him to his own crib before he becomes mobile enough to bump into the changing table.Assembling it was a breeze. Each individual piece is straightforward to attach or remove. The color was a perfect match to what I ordered. . I also appreciate the versatility of this unit, knowing we'll use it for travel and even at my workplace once our baby outgrows our bedroom. I hope this detailed review helps, but trust me when I say you won't regret purchasing this \u2013 it's fantastic. I would buy it again in a heartbeat if necessary!",

                "reviewText": "I got this for having a bedside bassinet/mini crib that will eventually be used for travel etc because I didn't want a bassinet that would turn into a expensive laundry hamper. I use the bassinet around the house for naps and he sleeps in the mini crib at night beside the bed. The bassinet is a little small, my baby is currently 8lbs and three and half weeks old and is quickly outgrowing it (he is around 21in long). He still fits in it but definitely will grow out of it before 3months. It is really nice that it comes with the separate bassinet storage/travel bag. It is really nice to be able to pack up when spending the day with family and needing a safe nap space for the baby. It will also be great to store it once the baby has grown out of it.The changing table is fantastic for night time changes. I have everything I need in the storage on the side and we keep blankets on the changing pad because our baby hates anything cold. It is easily cleaned by wiping it down if you don't put blankets down like we do.The mini crib feature is my favorite part of this Pack N' Play. It fits in like a structured hammock so you can rock your baby a little and it shifts a little as the baby moves. It is very secure but the little bit of movement is great if your baby likes movement like mine. The padding for both bassinet and mini crib is pretty soft but nicely firm for newborns, I didn't feel like I needed to put an extra mattress in either of them. We keep the changing table on the Pack N' Play and just lay the baby down on the other side. We will transition him to his own crib before he moves around enough to bump himself on the changing table.I can't speak to the play yard yet as we haven't used it.It was easy enough to assemble. I did it by myself at 38 weeks pregnant. vAll the individual pieces are easy to put on or take off. The color was great and accurate to what I ordered. I have loved everything I have purchased from Graco (stroller, bouncer/rocker, Pack N' Play). I also love that this is versatile and will be using it for travel and at my work once our baby is out of our bedroom. This was probably too much information but trust me that you will not regret purchasing this, its fantastic and I would purchase again in an instant if needed! 5425",
