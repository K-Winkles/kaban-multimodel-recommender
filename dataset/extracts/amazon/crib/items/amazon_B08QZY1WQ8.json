The material does not seem to be made of recycled wood it feels like it\u2019s great quality for the price. It doesn\u2019t come with the additional conversion pieces but we got a few years before our daughter requires a twin size bed. The tools (the one allen wrench) and your hands is all that is require for assembly.",

I do love the extra screws it came with to fill holes so baby doesn't stick her fingers in them. I also love it came with TWO Allen keys so both me and my hubby could work on it at once. Out of all the furniture we but together this came with easy instructions and didn't take too long for us to put together. All in all it seems very sturdy and beautiful, a lovely gift to have and one that grows with her is money well spent! I currently have it as a crib so will update when I switch to toddler. ^.^",
