Feels very sturdy and we didn\u2019t found a single defect on it, matches with all the natural wood tone accesories we\u2019ve gotten including the dresser.Worth it even at it\u2019s regular price.I absolutely love it.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this crib for grandparents house and it\u2019s worked out wonderfully. Clean lines on the crib frame, with the colors, make it look modern and not too bulky which is key for grandparents home. It truly blends in with most decor. I really was looking for something sturdy, of good value, and that could be used in the future. It\u2019s certainly sturdy, functional, and I have no doubt it will hold up to the shenanigans of my rambunctious baby. The price is great for what you\u2019re getting, especially considering it is convertible. It actually already comes with a piece to allow conversion to the toddler bed (you can just buy the toddler rail separately) which you usually have to purchase separately. Only negative is that since I didn\u2019t realize the conversion piece was included, i spent far too long trying to figure out how to use the hardware associated with that piece. If I had known from the start putting it together would have taken only 30 minutes!",

                "reviewText": "I order this crib on Sept. 2 with anticipation for my newborns arrival (due date Nov 24). After shipping rescheduled 3 times, I finally received it on Nov 17th. Talk about cutting it close! I was so worried that my order was going to be cancelled by the seller or Amazon, I almost cancelled it myself and bought it somewhere else in order to have it on time. But my gut intuition said to hold out a bit longer. Thankfully it was right. My husband I just built it and it matches so good in the baby room and looks super cute. Not a crib style you can find anywhere. It was relatively easy to assemble, though having 2 people made it significantly easier. I can\u2019t imagine having left myHusband to do it alone. It would have taken double the time. There were extra parts at the end of building it, which at first was alarming, but then we realized they are meant to be used when the crib converts to a toddler bed. I wish it came with some sort of packaging or case to store those extra parts. We will just store it in the closet for now. It has 3 height levels to lower when the baby starts to get tall. Overall, without having used it with a child inside, it\u2019s a good buy. Don\u2019t forget to buy the crib mattress separately. I bought one from Amazon that is a standard universal size and it fits perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "Beautiful design and it was easy to put together. The only thing I would recommend for this, is that it should ABSOLUTELY come with wall securing mounts. I had to purchase some separately, due to the design at the foot of the crib, there's no support on the bottom on the outside perimeter, the crib is easily wobbles side to side. It could possibly be partial due to my carpet height? But still, I don't think it should be wobbling as much as it does. So my concern is when the baby gets older and is standing up and is pushing himself back-and-forth on the rail as toddlers do.... that it could tip over with his weight.... Or my other concern is, if hes laying in his crib in my 4 1/2 year old happens to come up and try to jump to see him better while holding on to the side, it may tip. When you put any weight on the side rail, it does tip towards you a little.",
