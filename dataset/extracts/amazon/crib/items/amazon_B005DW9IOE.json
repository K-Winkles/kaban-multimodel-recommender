                "reviewText": "First of all, I originally bought this off Amazon because it was cheap and it looked nice. It felt a little risky getting it, when all the other \"quality\" brands were at least twice the amount. But, I only got this because my middle child was still in his crib, and I was tired of putting my youngest into a pack n' play, just waiting for the middle child to be ready for a toddler bed. So, cheap was a priority.I ordered this with Prime, but even still, it arrived FAST! Only 1 day passed between purchase and delivery. That was impressive, although I understand this might just be a factor of how close I live to whatever hub it shipped from. Maybe a lucky coincidence, but it still made my day.As for setup, I just finished putting it together about 10 minutes ago, and it really wasn't too bad. I did it by myself in about 45 minutes, and if I had made my spouse help, it would have taken maybe half the time. Everything was nicely packed in the box and labeled with little stickies for easy of setup. I was a little confused at first trying to find the instructions, but they are actually in the envelop attached to the spring board. (Also, this envelop is apparently supposed to stay attached to the spring board as a safety warning, but I took mine off before I realized that.)The instructions were very easy to follow, and everything was labeled well, so it was easy to find everything and put it together. You don't need ANY tools of your own to put this together.As for parts included, this only comes with the crib and day bed configurations, but can be converted to toddler bed (half railing) and twin bed if you purchase the conversion kits separately. It also seems to have four positions for the height of the mattress, and the bolts are easy to put in and remove when you want to raise and lower the mattress.After everything was put together for the crib, I did have one board left, which I'll have to store until later when I turn this into a day bed (or buy the toddler conversion kit).Honestly, this was a great find, and I'm so happy that I no longer have to put my littlest in a pack n' play anymore (without breaking my wallet in the process). I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a simple, cheap (not cheap quality) crib. I almost wish I had found this for my other kids!",

                "reviewText": "Baby isn't here yet, so I will review other aspects of the crib after we get to use it. Firstly, the assembly was fairly straight forward, however I've put together various pieces of furniture before so it wasn't that tough if you are familiar with this type of assembly. The crib seems to be made of very sturdy material, however since it came in a big box and was a little heavy, the box sustained damage as well as one piece of the front of the crib. I expected this, and was damaged most likely by the transporter and not at Amazon. The price was right at $109 as there were other similar cribs at a higher cost. I will review again after the little one arrives and we put it to use.Update: The crib is no longer needed since our little one is too big for it. It lasted and now has been passed on to a friend that is expecting a baby. Great value and sturdy. This crib was great for us!",

                "reviewText": "The crib was delivered 2 days early, which was a plus. However, Upon this crib being delivered I was very worried. As the first two pictures show the packaging was completely damaged. On the side of the box was a rip/tear nearly from top to bottom. On top of the box I could see the box spring from the hole that was put in the box (I am guessing through transit).To my surprise and complete relief there was no damages to the crib itself. All of the pieces and hardware were still in great condition.I put this crib together myself which took me about 30-40 minutes tops. It may be a little easier with two people but it\u2019s not impossible for one person to get it done (I am nearly 32 weeks pregnant btw).Once the crib was completely assembled i was very pleased with the quality of it. It is very sturdy and the wood it\u2019s not cheaply made.The crib does convert to a toddler bed as well as a head and foot board for a full-sized bed. Now the crib does come with the bottom rail to convert to a toddler bed however, it does not come with the toddler bed guard rail as shown in some of the pictures. That is an additional piece you would have to purchase separately as well as the rails to fit a full-sized bed.Overall, I would highly recommend this crib. I was able to purchase it for $129.00 plus tax. Shipping was free with prime.",
