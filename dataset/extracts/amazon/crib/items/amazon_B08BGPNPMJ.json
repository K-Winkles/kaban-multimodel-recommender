Her top crib rails are severely gashed but these have stopped her from doing any more damage or causing herself anymore splinters. They slide around a little bit even when using the ties and velcro but the rails are on the thinner side. Make sure the ties are facing out. She\u2019s never really been interested in the ties or tried to take them off but I guess that may depend on the baby. These were the best option I could find on Amazon and I\u2019m happy we tried them.",

                "reviewText": "This is a dangerous product that doesn't secure adequately.My one-year-old was holding on and the velcro became detached with her pulling. Because the middle tie secures only on one side, the cover pulled over to the inside of the crib in the middle and because she was holding on to it, she hit her head. Thankfully she's a sturdy kid and only had a bloody nose but if my baby had been younger or had she fallen in another way, she likely would have been seriously injured. This is a massive oversight. Imagine running into your nursery and your baby's face is covered in blood, and this stupid crib cover is pulled over on her. This should be recalled.",
