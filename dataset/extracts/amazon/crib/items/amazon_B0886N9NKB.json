It also has a storage drawer underneath which is an awesome plus when one is challenged for space!;) Very happy all \u2018round with this purchase\u2728",

I put the wood part of the crib on my porch to air out for over a week. It did help a little. The crib is now in my room and I can still smell it. Maybe I have a sensitive nose, but it bothers me and I don\u2019t feel good about putting my baby into a crib that smells like that. For now I have an air purifier on 24/7 and I\u2019m hoping that it will off-gas more. I bought an expensive baby green guard mattress for this crib, but it seems pointless with the smell from the crib.",

                "reviewText": "We looked for a long time for the best crib for us. We have limited space in our room so a mini crib was our best option. This one is very secure and it\u2019s an amazing quality. It comes with a thin mat but we bought the mattress separately. This one came just with the mini crib kit and the expansion kits for the toddler bed and twin bed are sold apart. This is perfect for what we needed. The price is very attractive compare to the other options we looked at and again, quality is perfect for the little ones.",

I assembled this on my own postpartum c section in about 90 minutes. Directions are clear like ikea directions with illustrations. I love the drawer underneath.",
