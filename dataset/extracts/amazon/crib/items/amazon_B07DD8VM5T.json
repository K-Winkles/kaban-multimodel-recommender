I absolutely love this mini crib! I was rather upset that I didn\u2019t get to have a full size crib since we are room sharing with our new addition, but this crib definitely made up for it. It\u2019s super cute and good quality, but also it\u2019s small enough so she has her own area in our room. It was pretty easy to put together with my husbands help so that is definitely a plus. My only thing is that while there is technically a mattress included, it\u2019s VERY thin (like, 1 1/2 in.) so I\u2019d you are wanting something bigger you\u2019ll have to order that separate.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, **this is NOT an incentivized review**.Second of all, this crib is gorgeous and shockingly solid for the price. I was set on a standard sized, solid wood, beautiful crib that cost a couple hundred dollars more, but finally decided to give in and get this thing thanks to the seemingly never-ending inflation plaguing us all. It\u2019s a decision I don\u2019t regret, and I really hope my baby can stay in this for a long time.The crib has a \u201clodge\u201d look, reminiscent of a warm and welcoming cabin in the woods. I purchased woodland themed sheets to go with it, and they enhance the look. As another reviewer stated, the wood is soft, so be careful with it during assembly, or if you have to move it. If you can do this, it should serve you well and add some charm to your home!One more thing - we keep this crib right next to our bed, since our baby is still very little. We had a bedside bassinet at first, but if we had another baby we\u2019d probably put her in this crib right from the start.",

It most certainly does not. It\u2019s the perfect size and color. I\u2019m so happy with my purchase. I am 33 weeks and it took me alone about an hour to assemble. Very easy. I recommend!",

Overall sturdiness seems good--had one minor flaw in the headboard, a crack that existed or may have occurred when fitting pieces together. It didn't impact integrity, aesthetics, or pose a risk to baby, so we didn't go through the hassle of unassembling/returning the product.Overall, we are happy with this mini crib, it fits our needs and space, and it was much more affordable than other cribs on the market.",

It felt very sturdy once we had everything together. This crib came with a mattress even though I didn\u2019t purchase the added mattress option, however the mattress is super thin, maybe 1\u201d thick and not firm at all, I would suggest purchasing a 3\u201d firm mini crib or pack n play mattress for it like I did. I actually stacked the 3\u201d mattress I had on top the mattress the crib came with and put a crib sheet over them and now I have a 4\u201d firm crib mattress!",

Although he actually never spent one night in it it was not an eyesore in our bedroom (until it became a laundry basket lol). It's very sturdy, nice looking and roomy for a small crib. The mattress that comes with it is very thin so we just put a thicker one on top of it.",
