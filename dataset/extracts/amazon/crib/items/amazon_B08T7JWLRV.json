                "reviewText": "This works well for the baby. He\u2019s got room to move a little and it\u2019s high enough that he can look around. It doesn\u2019t take up a lot of space in the house and folds down very small. I easily just take it to whatever room I need.Downside is it is not level. The middle legs are slightly longer than the end legs. This causes it to have a small wobble/rock. It\u2019s not bad enough to return but is noticeable.",
