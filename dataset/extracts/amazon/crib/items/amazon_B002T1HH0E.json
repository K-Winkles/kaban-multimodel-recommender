                "reviewText": "The crib arrived in perfect condition. It was easy to put together. It took me less than 15 minutes and I\u2019m 7 months pregnant. We ordered it in ebony. The screws looked rusty which doesn\u2019t matter to us because the crib is black but might matter in a lighter paint color. We won\u2019t be using the wheels. They look super cheap and hazardous with our floors. I put some floor protectors on the bottom of each leg. It says you need a Phillips screwdriver but not sure why because it includes an Allen wrench and that\u2019s all you use for the whole thing. I would recommend using a leveler when you are placing the spring portion because ours looks offset until I used one to correct myself.",

                "reviewText": "definitely met my expectations. Great price, great design. Most impressive was the Greenguard gold certification which was a must for me. I would agree that this product does not feel as strong as other wooden cribs (we have a potterybarn that is much heavier and \"solid\" feeling. However, we pushed and shook the crib a bunch to get a sense of its sturdiness and I am very comfortable with how it felt. Given how light it is I would say that maybe a strong three year old jumping on it could move it a bit but I don't exactly plan on that happening. We did not use the wheels, mine arrived with silver wheels not gold, as this is on a hardwood floor and I don't want it to move around.",
