He grew out of his bassinet and I switched to this, it was easy to assemble (the instructions are conveniently printed on the base board) and the best part about it is the way it folds for storage if you aren't using it! It has wheels so it moves around easily. I don't have anything bad to say about the crib itself. However I do recommend buying a separate mattress because the pad it comes with is very thin.",

Apparently that is the weight limit for most bassinets! My little guy outgrew the bassinet by like 3 months, and we weren't ready to move him to the crib in his own room just yet. We attempted to move the big crib from the nursery into our bedroom but it was just way too big. We ended up buying this portable mini crib and it worked for our space so well. I wish we had just used this from the get go instead of buying the bassinet! It went together quick, rolled easily on our carpet floors, and fit a mini crib mattress perfectly. The mobile we had fit on the side of the crib nicely. We used that crib until he was ready to move into his own room, then gave it to my parents for when they watch him. 100% recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Overall the crib is fine, however assembly was a challenge, locks did not align with the holes, the base platform plastic piece appeared to be on the wrong side of the base or they intend for your baby's mattress to rest on top of two metal locks, doesn't appear correct. The instructions are mounted onto the base, so it is tricky to follow each step mid way through assembly. And if you screw in the lock to a point that the screws are flush, the lock is too tight - so they have to remain raised a bit. Overall, quality control could use some improvement. It functions, but could be improved.",

It's taken over two weeks to attempt to put this \"crib\" together due to sections of the crib metals being so bent that they require a vise to correct the bent metal, cheap aluminum screws that strip so we had to replace them with stronger screws. The \"mattress\" that is included is no thicker than a piece of cardboard and less comfortable. What a waste of money, time, effort! Shame on you for selling this crap.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First let me start by saying, don\u2019t be scared by other reviews.We were a little afraid based on reviews stating how difficult it was to build, it wasn\u2019t.My hubby built this by himself in less than an hour. MAYBE 45 minutes if that.I didn\u2019t help, being on bed rest I just watched.It was annoying that the instructions were on the board itself(that lays down and is the shelf for the mattress) but it was still doable since that\u2019s the last thing that goes in anyway.My hubby is an electrician and not so great at building things by himself sometimes and he did great.Some things I did want to point out:-Be careful! The paint can chip/scuff easily, we made a scuff or two but nowhere really visible.-Don\u2019t completely open the package of screws/parts and just open and take as you go. They\u2019re all labeled on the packaging and if you just open it up and pour it all out you won\u2019t know which is which.-BUY A SEPARATE MATTRESS! I can\u2019t stress this enough, the \u201cmattress\u201d it comes with is a total insult lol, luckily I read about it beforehand and had bought a mattress from the same company. The mattress in the crib in the picture is NOT the one it comes with. There\u2019s a separate picture showing the one it comes with, which is basically a piece of foam with plastic covering. I\u2019ll be using it as added cushion in my pack and play.My review is solely based on the crib and assembly, not the mattress so that\u2019s why it didn\u2019t effect the rating. I\u2019m not used to cribs coming with mattresses anyway so it\u2019s not that serious.It\u2019s perfect for us since we\u2019re room sharing with baby and it\u2019s just small enough to be convenient but big enough for necessity.",

                "reviewText": "the base (the part which holds the mattress) fell right through after one night - thankfully it only fell on one side while my baby was sleeping, and the other side didn't go through until i picked him up - otherwise he would have fallen straight through to the floor. when i went on amazon to report that it was defective, i realized from the picture that we are missing the little rectangular supports that screw in underneath the base - so, maybe our unit was missing them, or maybe they got lost when we threw away the packaging, i have no way of knowing - but when you assemble the crib, please make sure you have them, otherwise it is a serious danger to your baby - the metal latches that hold the base slip out, and definitely are not enough to hold it in place!! i initially bought this for my older baby (18 months) but i saw right away that because it was so lightweight, the whole thing would be easy for him to move (even with the wheels locked) and possibly tip over when he wakes up and shakes the railing wanting to get out. so we used it for my 5 month old instead (and now will be putting out with the trash, since without those little supports, the base is unstable). in any case, the product lists a 35 lb weight limit (beyond which maybe it could collapse?), but our son is only 25 lbs and the issue probably isn't weight, but whether the kid can stand and shake the crib. in my opinion, this product should not be used for an older baby who can stand; it's just too flimsy.",
