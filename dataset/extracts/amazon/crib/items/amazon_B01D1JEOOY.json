                "reviewText": "My wife and I went shopping at numerous baby & furniture stores looking for the right crib. Unfortunately, there isn't a wide selection of grey cribs which is the style we were looking for.I actually ordered this crib directly through the manufacturers website, but received a call a couple days later saying it was out of stock and would take up to 2 months to ship. I cancelled the order once I saw Amazon had it available for shipping the next day.I was a little nervous about the crib as we had not seen it in person (only viewed it online) and I didn't know how difficult it would be to put together. Luckily, there was nothing to be concerned about. The crib showed up a few days after ordering and was very easy to put together (this coming from someone who is not very handy.) It feels sturdy and looks great in the nursery and we're looking forward to using it once our child is old enough for it.Overall, the quality is perfect for what we were looking for and the fact that it will convert into a toddler bed and later a bed is great.Keep in mind, this is not the same quality as top end cribs from furniture stores. The wood is a little softer, so I'm sure it will scratch and dent with use. But that is all about how much you want to spend. What we were looking for was a good looking, safe crib and this one meets both of those criteria.",

I was looking for a slate grey crib to match the paint job, and this matches so perfectly I have had people ask me if I painted the crib to match the wall! Not only is the color absolutely lovely, but the crib is beautiful. It's incredibly solid, doesn't move at all when you try to shake it or bend over it. I am so happy I went with this crib. My friend who is pregnant could not decide on a crib and after coming over and seeing mine she went and purchased the same one. Trust me, you will not regret this purchase. Such a great value too, you cannot go wrong with the price. It also is really easy to put together, took my husband and I less than an hour. I would buy again and again! And I cannot wait to convert this to a regular bed when my little angel grows up, it will make a beautiful headboard!",

                "reviewText": "First of all, this crib is beautiful. It\u2019s an absolute pain to put together, but once it\u2019s together it\u2019s really beautiful. It\u2019s pretty sturdy, but maybe a little lighter weight than I\u2019d like (I\u2019ll be buying some rubber or silicone stoppers for the feet because on wood floors it wants to move easily).While there is some adjustability in terms of height, the settings are only around 2 inches apart and the max height is still pretty low, though I\u2019m sure this is probably a deliberate safety feature.Quality\u2014 while the wood finish is beautiful, it\u2019s also VERY soft and we accidentally scratched it just assembling it. The other cosmetic thing I would change if I could is the fact that it\u2019s assembled with large bolts and screws and they did not provide any kind of peg or cover to disguise the large drill holes once it\u2019s put together. For such a lovely piece of furniture this little detail makes it look a little cheap.Overall, we\u2019re very happy with it. The look is exactly what we wanted, and it was a great value for a 4-in-1 convertible crib.",

                "reviewText": "I just received the crib today and was delivered a day early. Love the rich gray color and feels very sturdy. It came undamaged and all the parts were there. I put it together myself. It was fairly easy but definitely read/look at the diagram pictures careful. The panels are not marked A, B, D, E etc. Make sure you are using the correct sized screws. The one part I don't like is the Warning stickers on the side of the crib (don't judge ;) I will be taking that off. Rating it a 4 Star due to poor instructions and the warning sticker but rating the crib itself definitely a 5 star. All in all I love the crib and can't wait for our little one to arrive.",

                "reviewText": "This crib arrived in a large, flat cardboard box, and was super heavy. My husband was able to carry it upstairs to the nursery for assembly, but I would not have been able to do it myself, and I\u2019m guessing he would have liked to have a second person helping him.The crib have LOTS of pieces, many of which looked similar. It took about an hour to put together, and overall, wasn\u2019t too tough. We were happy with the quality; one piece was scratched pretty deep, though. We worked through the manufacturer\u2019s website, and they shipped a replacement piece, no problem (we were pretty happy).Overall, the crib looks more expensive than what we paid, and we were happy that we selected this crib. It\u2019s sturdy, not too tough to assemble, and doesn\u2019t appear \u201ccheap.\u201d It does arrive in a very heavy box, so make sure you have help on hand if you\u2019re trying to move up a staircase.",
