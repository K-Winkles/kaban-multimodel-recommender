It's soft, sleek and smooth. Sturdy but light enough to scoot around and move when you need to. I did notice one rail seemed to connect about half an inch off of being flush with the piece in front, but it didn't matter or affect it any.The crib has a nice plastic rail on the front to protect against chips or teething. Do not recommend using the \"mattress pad\" that this or any DOM crib comes with. They are very cheap, flimsy and thin.",

For first time parents, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this mini crib. My daughter is 18 months old now and we\u2019re transitioning her to next phase, toddler bed. This crib turns into a day bed (shown in the pictures), there are no railings or anything that is compatible with this model. And because its a mini crib, there are no bumpers made for this size. We ended up ordering an actual toddler bed to replace this crib.",
