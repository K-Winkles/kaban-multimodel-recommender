Second one was perfect!Item is HEAVY, so if you are a female or expecting plan on getting help lifting it.It is beautiful, sturdy, heavy duty, color (rustic gray) looks like the image shown.NOTE: Keep in mind this doesn't come with rails for transitioning to toddler, or full size bed. You have to purchase those separately from Delta's website. You get the wooden headboard, footboard, and all necessary parts needed to use as a crib (only) in this box.If you want other pieces of nursery furniture (changing table, dresser, etc.,) in this color, you will not be able to purchaae them right away...manufacturer website says expected back in stock March 2022...? That's aggravating, but this didn't alter my review, I just wanted to share in case that's a deal breaker for anyone thinking of purchasing this crib.Overall, it is stunning, sturdy, and should hold up for many years to come.",

Everything we looked at just seemed flimsy to me and wouldn't be something we'd want for him to use as he gets older. But this crib is definitely sturdy; the wood is solid and doesn't feel like plastic (like some cribs do), and it doesn't wiggle or move at all when you shake it. The color is fabulous, and is just the perfect rustic look we were wanting. It'll definitely be a nice bed once converted to a full size when it's time.We are so happy we ordered this!(Especially while it was on sale!)",

At Target this same crib is sold for 429.99, and I just could not imagine paying that kind of money for it. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful piece. But it's nothing to write home to mom about. for that kind of money. Luckily Amazon has it on sale for $299.99--so the value seems relatively appropriate. The sturdiness thus far seems good, but I won't be able to say much else until we use it with the baby.",

We did notice that you have to go through the actual company for the toddler rail if that's something you are interested in, which could be a downside. Once we found the directions online, it was easy to put together. However, directions inside the box would have been a bit easier!",
