                "reviewText": "Love the look and sturdiness of the crib. HOWEVER, it was a pain in my butt to put together!!! One recommendation I have for you guys is to actually put steps within your steps you have on the instructions. The instruction steps are good pictures and easy to see, but we had to unscrew and start over in the beginning once we realized we should have connected certain pieces first, which is not detailed within the \u201csteps\u201d provided. Would save consumers some frustration.The most frustrating part was once we put together the head board and the front part of the crib (which took us 2 days because we got frustrated and stopped multiple times, and tried again the next day \ud83e\udd2a) the sides of the crib were not fitting into the pre-drilled holes. I almost thought we were going to have to send it back because we got a defective crib\u2026.the manufacturer had actually put the warning label stickers, and the actual logo of the company on upside down (see photos) which is why when they are right side up and should be on the bottom of the crib the pieces weren\u2019t fitting and we could not screw it onto the front of the crib! My husband flipped it around, so what seemed like the bottom with the labels being able to be read correctly, which were now upside down and on the top part of the crib then we could finally put everything together correctly and pre drilled screw holes were matching up! It was definitely a frustrating experience.",
