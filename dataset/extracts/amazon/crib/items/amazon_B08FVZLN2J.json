                "reviewText": "This changing table was bought for a few reasons, I liked the gold to it (it\u2019s more of a bronze in person tho, nbd), the design of the table, and the seemingly simple construction. When it was received, my husband put it together while I sat by and ate some grapefruit. He struggled with one of the bars pretty badly, as it\u2019s piece didn\u2019t fit well and it seemed to be kind of a cheap plastic part, where the bar goes into the rail to hold the shelf. He struggled for about 10 minutes with it, and ultimately had to force it into place resulting in the top shelf being difficult to pop into place. Although in the end, everything was able to be put together fine, and it seems sturdy. I have no qualms other than the annoying sticker (put a hot washcloth over it to steam lift it), slight assembly annoyance, and the misjudge of color... one thing I would like to add is that it came with a little sheet stating that in 2018 they donated something like 1000 garden kits to kids to help the endangered monarch butterfly population, which is very sweet, even though it\u2019s been 3 years, what have they done since then? Not sure, but that was enough to make me feel good about purchasing the table. All in all, I would recommend, but have someone with some muscle put it together because it will need it!",
