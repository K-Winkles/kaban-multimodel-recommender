No recalls have hit Dream on Me in recent years even as many other crib manufacturers have had major safety issues and recallsThis crib has the look of a solid piece of furniture. It's built of New Zealand pine--a soft wood, but in a crib with slats and a solid back panel it works just fine. The back panel imparts a hint of elegance, but the weight of the crib is still just 45 pounds, substantially lighter than many more expensive cribs.So this is not a lifetime crib, just a good-looking pragmatic and safe choice.The crib's sides do not lower. The mattress platform moves between three levels.The crib comes with a very thin (1-inch thick) mattress pad, not a true mattress. You will want to buy a thicker mattress for the crib. Ironically, this cheap, thin mattress is probably quite safe for babies because there is so little room for entrapment. But if you want a more substantial mattress you can get a nice 3-inch-thick one from the manufacturer here: https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Me-Portable-Mattress-White/dp/B0030UUBMO?ref_=ast_sto_dp.Overall, an attractive, well-built non-heirloom-quality but functional crib.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased many things through the years and I have never been more disappointed. Although the box only had one small mark of damage the contents were a wreck. It appeared as though this was not a new product due to all the damage. In addition, I was very disappointed in the quality of the product. It just did not seem sturdy or I would have had it replaced. Based on the feel of the parts, I\u2019d feel safer putting a baby in a cardboard box. The reviews are pretty good for this mini crib so maybe mine was just a fluke but I just don\u2019t want a repeat of this again.",
