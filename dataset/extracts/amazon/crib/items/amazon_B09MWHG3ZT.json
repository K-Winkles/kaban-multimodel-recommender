I watch my god daughter once a week so while I really wanted the Graco I didn\u2019t like the price tag and was waiting to see if it would drop. This was so easy to put together! Seems super sturdy. Comes with a travel bag and a small detachable bag for toys or what not. Carnival color is unisex, with the cute multi color zoo animals. Would recommend this.",

Still a little annoying to attach the mattress. A slightly bigger gap between the head and foot of the mattress and the frame than in our previous model. But overall nice an comfortable and sturdy, our baby sleeps in it every night. I wish there were better sheets for it though.",

                "reviewText": "I couldn't be happier with this baby pack and play, and the extra features are well worth the investment. The baby bassinet and changing table are game-changers for parents, making it easy to set up a convenient and comfortable space for our little one.The neutral colors are a big plus, ensuring that this pack and play remains a versatile option regardless of the gender of your baby. It's a great choice for parents who may have different needs in the future.The changing pad, while a bit tricky to assemble initially, is a real asset, especially when you're set up somewhere for a few days. It's a lifesaver for quick diaper changes without needing to find a dedicated surface.One standout feature is the baby bassinet, which I appreciate for its larger size compared to other models. It's spacious and provides a comfortable sleeping area for our little one.The only downside is the difficulty of fitting it back into the Graco carry bag. I wish the bag were larger to accommodate the entire pack and play more easily. Nonetheless, this has become an essential part of our baby gear, and I would recommend it to any parent looking for a versatile and practical solution for their little one.",
