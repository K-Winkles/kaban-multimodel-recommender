                "reviewText": "Despite triple-checking that our model of crib was one of the compatible ones listed (both on the Amazon listing and in the list of compatible models in the instruction booklet), when trying to install this I found that the bolt and bracket holding up the mattress support were blocking me from being able to line the guard rail up with the holes on the front rail of the crib. Fortunately, this is made of actual wood so I was able to grab a saw and some chisels to make it fit, but it wasn't something I'd originally planned for when getting ready to install. It's also important to read the instructions thoroughly before installing, as not all of the holes on the rail are used for all models.Now that I've got it in place, it seems to be working just fine, giving kiddo a cozy corner to sleep in without sprawling out onto the floor (accidentally at least).",
