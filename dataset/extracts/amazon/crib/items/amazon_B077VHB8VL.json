Thought it surely must be an error because the color was so off\u2026.. guess I was mistaken. Their response was \u201csorry, change in manufacturing dates can result in slight variations in color between different batches\u201d and nothing could be done.After spending so much on a crib and then even more on additional parts you\u2019d think they\u2019d at least keep the colors consistent. Disappointing to say the least. Sadly I already have the crib so I\u2019m stuck with this mis matched side rail until we remove it at a later date. Won\u2019t purchase the upgrades to twin bed like we planned.",
