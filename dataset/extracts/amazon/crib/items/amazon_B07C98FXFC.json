                "reviewText": "At one-tenth the cost of some luxury cribs, we knew we were getting a good deal when we bought this crib for $150 on Black Friday. Overall, we are pleased with it - it's a nice size for the nursery and has the convenience of a changing table and shelves on one end. Ultimately, we needed 2 people for assembly as the bottom part of the crib was a bit cumbersome to install, but we accomplished it all without great difficulty. Our biggest disappointment is the scuffed/scratched pieces on the changing table. As we unboxed, we noticed the damage, but didn't feel like going through the hassle of a return to get replacements. So, we'll have to cover them with protective tape to keep our baby safe from splinters. Overall, though, I am pleased with the product for the price.",
