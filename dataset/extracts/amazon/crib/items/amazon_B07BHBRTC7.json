This one is very user friendly but also absolutely adorable to use as space to lay my infant granddaughters in during moments I need a safe space to use for them. This play pen comes with an extra changing table that is easily attached and detachable as well as the most adorable mobile for the girls to watch. I have purchased several high end as well as cost effective playpens over the years and I have to say this gives the extremely high end models a run for the money as it\u2019s not only great quality but also affordable.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I absolutely love this product! Let me start by saying this...It was a bit confusing to put together as the center of the pack n play wouldn't cooperate as I kept trying to pull it apart, thinking the center would fall and click, similar to a folding chair. But then I realized my mistake: Yank the sides upwards until each one clicks BEFORE you push down the center. This was in the instructions but I definitely misread them. Once that was set, the mat, which comes folded around the frame, unravels and you place that in and bam its ready!! Need to use the bassinet instead?Just snap in the bassinet before you place the mat for extra support and the baby is all set. I really love this product! Its convenient. A real great price and mostly, even my little one appreciates it.The only issue I have is the basket that comes with it is very flimsy. All I have in it is medicated cream (my 7 month old has real bad eczema), travel sized bottle of lotion, half empty pack of wipes and a few pampers. It nearly holding on to any of it.She loves it and the design is very distracting to her when she's not watching reruns of Yo Gabba Gabba (thats what's in the background of the video) and the flowers are her constant attention grabbers.Do keep in mind: The mattress, and bedsheets aren't included. Don't leave toys, loose blankets, pillows in while the baby is sleeping.",

To put the actual \u201cplay yard\u201d together, you NEED to pull each of the sides up FIRST. Do not pull upwards starting from the middle of each rail, but instead from the ends (closer to the black joints at the corners of the pack n play). Do that for each side rail then push the center of the pack n play down to lock it. From there, the rest of the items slide on fairly easy. The hooks to hang the bassinet were a bit tricky to slide on at first, but once they\u2019re on, it feels secure! I\u2019m obsessed with how cute this is \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc97",
