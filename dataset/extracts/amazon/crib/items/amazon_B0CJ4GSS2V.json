We got her a new bassinet to keep the newborn close to her bad at night. When we came across this caddy on Amazon, we knew it would be a welcome addition to her room.The caddy attached directly on the side of the bassinet and is a very useful organizer. It holds the essentials for changing her newborn close at hand when it matters most. It does not twist or deform when it is stuffed full and hangs neatly on the side and out of the way until you need it.Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "So this diaper caddy for the side of my baby\u2019s crib is absolutely disappointing. First off, it\u2019s nearly impossible to load diapers into, and you can maybe only load a few into it before it becomes even more impossible thanks to the tiny opening you have to stick things through. The second problem is to be expected considering the first, but just as you are unable to load diapers into the compartment, you also cannot remove diapers easily. At all. All around useless piece of material. The only reason I even gave it two stars is because the little shelf/ledge on the top works alright and the hooks definitely hook on tightly, the but number one thing I\u2019d ordered this for, I can even use it for.",

It\u2019s quite large and holds a blanket underneath, toys, wipes, diapers, pacifiers, etc. I took off a star because I wish it was more reinforced, it doesn\u2019t stay open super well on its own and relies on a solid structure (like a crib) to hold it level. It still does the job though and the plain black color looks nice. I think it\u2019s a good value currently as well. Hope this helps \ud83d\ude04",
