Installation was easy once you figured it out. Sturdy enough to hold a sleeping baby, but not sturdy enough to climb on. And to be fair, my daughter never tried to. Can be opened and closed for access. It did not cover the whole side of the crib, so we just leave it up and my daughter climbs through the gaps. It's a good intermediary step of going from a crib to a toddler bed.",

Even with trying to figure it out took about two minutes to assemble. I really wanted this to work because it is significantly cheaper than my other option which I will now pursue because it doesn\u2019t work with my crib we bought from Target. Because the mattress sits on metal grate thing, and also sits flush with the bottom front rail there is no room for the foldable \u201cjoint\u201d to sit other than on that front rail. This lifts up the front of the mattress which would not even be a bid deal except it will eventually damage my crib. I also want to point out that the straps are great except there is no room between the crib and the platform to accommodate the bulky anchors. Something flat that could pass under the mattress and be flat against the opposite side of the mattress from the rail would be better. The anchors kind of fit in the corner of the crib but that is not how it\u2019s designed.We have the newton mattress and the delta children\u2019s Jordan 4 in 1 convertible crib from target.",
