                "reviewText": "This is a beautiful crib. Normally I use the one I had from my oldest son, however since my two year old son still uses it I needed a second one for my daughter. This is a beautiful crib, it sits much lower than a standard 4 in 1 crib. The front wall comes up to my waist give or take and I'm only 5ft tall and to my husband's bum who is 5'9. It took both of us to put together since you have to connect the side curved edge, side railing, and leg all at the same time which I find to be a bit of a pain. The newborn mattress setting is very low, honestly the newborn setting will be used until the baby starts to pull up because that can sit up in it without reaching the top of the rail. The front spiral on the legs that looks so beautiful and made into the bed is in fact a screw and you cover it with a white sticker which makes it look very tacky to me. I did take away a start for these things. I do think it is a wonderful deal for a crib and beautiful though.",
