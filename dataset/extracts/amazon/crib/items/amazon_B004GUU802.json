The first crib that was sent arrived defective so the replacement crib they sent me worked great took 3 days to put together very complex design. it was frustrating because a few pieces did crack but the manufacturer sent me replacement parts. So glad it is all ready now for my son! Love the crib now. I used it for a lot of storage of diapers but to be honest if you are looking for a very easy assembly this crib isn\u2019t for you. you must have patience to install this crib. I\u2019m giving it a 4 because in the end i I love with the crib for the price and for the way it fits perfectly in my bedroom how i feel it is safe now for my baby. Would give a 5 but I am being honest about the frustrations i had with the very first crib.",

                "reviewText": "So the crib is good it\u2019s sturdy and was easy to put together it\u2019s light weight so it\u2019s easy to move around if needed. However it is super small I didn\u2019t think it was going to be as small as it actually is. My son didn\u2019t fit in the changing table when he was 4 months so we couldn\u2019t change him on it anymore after 4 months he was to long and could barely fit in it. He\u2019s now 17 months old I had to lower the crib as low as it goes and he\u2019s almost able to get over it. When he lays down he\u2019s almost as long as the crib. I know it said mini but again didn\u2019t realize it was pretty much for a doll. It says it\u2019s able to change and you can make it into different beds like a day bed twin size bed etc. but you have to buy they extra pieces and I still haven\u2019t found the correct pieces for it yet. I\u2019ve tried to contact that company itself but never heard back from them. So my son usually sleeps in a playpen because he seems to be so big. Oh also the mattress they give is absolutely insane I\u2019m not sure why they even bother it\u2019s the most thinnest piece I\u2019ve ever seen it\u2019s more like a changing table pad not a mattress so I had to actually buy a mattress for the crib.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this crib because it had such versatility, a changing station with a railing and drawers, and it's aesthetically cute. This was a rookie first time mom mistake. I didn't realize how different a MINI crib is to a regular crib. The crib is tiny and I anticipate my daughter growing out of it quickly. My kiddo always rotates 360 degrees in her sleep and the width of this tiny thing is not enough for her not to bonk her head a bunch of times in the process. It's only slightly larger than her bassinet was. Also, it doesn't come with a mattress so you have to purchase a mini crib mattress with the correct dimensions. I also didn't realize the changing station is a fairly small size so I can't even use it for my 7 month old now, as it is just too small. It would be fine for a newborn but we never ended up using it because our pack and play changing station was bigger and more comfortable. My husband said it wasn't too difficult to put together at least. All in all, I would recommend buying a full size crib for your baby. This is as advertised so it's not the sellers fault, but I wish I had done more research before purchasing and I wouldn't recommend this.",

The drawers are nice and go in easily since the tracks are preinstalled and I did put my own knobs on but the ones it comes with would be just fine if I didn\u2019t have my own.
