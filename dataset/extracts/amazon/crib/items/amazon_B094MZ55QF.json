                "reviewText": "This saved us many many sleepless nights with our 1 year old. He just needed to sleep by mom and couldn\u2019t sleep soundly alone in his room. We don\u2019t believe in cry it out so that wasn\u2019t an option. This bed literally allowed him and us to have 10+ hours of sleep a night. Only caveat you must buy a pad or your child will not be comfortable. So buy the pad and be kind to your child\u2019s comfort, second the edge of the crib co sleeper isn\u2019t padded so we put a pad their on the edge in case he rolled around at night. Lastly, the co sleep is slightly lower than our bed we remedied this with VERY thick down padding that met our bed equally so he can touch my arm or what not to make sure I was next to him. Our son is 19 months old now and 34 inches. He is ready to transition soon to his own bed and room soon as it only comfortably accommodates about a 3 ft tall toddler at the most - but we were saved y this bed truly. I highly recommend. It\u2019s not expensive or built perfectly - but if you add additions to it like mattress pad and padding it will be perfect.",

                "reviewText": "My only complaints are it's not height adjustable. I thought it was. So it's not level with my bed as I hoped. (I have a taller bed for storage underneath.) But that's not necessarily a bad thing depending on your preference. My fianc\u00e9 set it up and said the instructions weren't very clear, but it wasn't hard to put together being that it's a pack and play I guess. And the last more important complaint, for the purpose of sleeping in, the mattress is terrible. Baby mattresses are obviously firm and to us, seemingly uncomfortable. But this is supposed to be a bassinet as well and I'd rather my son sleep on a changing table pad. I'm going to purchase an additional mattress because this pad is really hard with very little cushion.",
