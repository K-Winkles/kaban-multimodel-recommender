The mattress/pad inside is quite sturdy and the little mobile directions occupy my LO's attention span for at least ten minutes. This is quite excellent for his tummy time and what we have mainly used it for. It folds up very nicely and is super easy for traveling. If you do use this, please watch the latches when assembling the play pen as they will pinch your hands (of course most any baby installation such as a car seat can also pinch and cut the hands!)",

It was sturdy. It was easy to set up once we knew how yet the hardest part was the zipper when getting it started was a bit challenging on the bassinet & my only real issue, still it felt sturdy once done though. Was easy to disassemble!",

I was looking into affordable pack n plays and this one does the job. If you move it you do have to make it study again, but to me it's no problem, the mattress really is very hard, definitely recommend buying a mattress topper, but so far so good!",

                "reviewText": "As a brand new grandmother, I spent DAYS going over the various options for a portable crib/pac and play before deciding on this Pamo. As the baby lives close by, I wanted it to be comfortable, sturdy and safe for frequent, but not daily, use. It also didn't hurt that it was discounted on prime day deals! I read previous reviews, and one issue I was concerned about was the difficulty of assembly that was mentioned. I put it together myself in about 20 minutes at a very casual speed. True that the instructions could be a clearer. The raised level for newborns actually zips in to place and that took me a few minutes to locate where to start the zipper connection. Wish the wheels rolled - I ended up dragging the bed across the floor. Will examine again - could be installer failure! I think this was a good choice for my purpose - adequate features without a lot of extra features that would have been nice for a short while but then would need to be stored away somewhere!",
