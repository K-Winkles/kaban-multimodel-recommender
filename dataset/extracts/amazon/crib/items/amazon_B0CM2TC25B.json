                "reviewText": "I love this bed rail! It was so easy and quick to put together. We are using this on our bed while our baby is small, and will definitely move it to her toddler bed when she\u2019s older. I like how you can fold it down and out of your way and the height is adjustable for thicker mattresses. Feels very sturdy.",
