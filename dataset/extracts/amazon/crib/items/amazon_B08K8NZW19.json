                "reviewText": "Watching some of these review videos had me cackling. First of all, read the instructions when you\u2019re setting something up. Center red part stays up, click short sides first, then long sides, then push down the center. Just like your phone or computer, if it stops engaging a lock on one of the sides, turn off and restart. You can\u2019t relock a short side with all the other sides locked. You have to START OVER.Secondly, yes the side dips, that\u2019s what the side clips are for. You attach them to the rail so it doesn\u2019t dip. Lordy.I do have some complaints though, the changing pad/table attaches to the same side the storage attachment does so you can\u2019t use both at the same time. Also, the changing pad/table can\u2019t stay on if you have the bedside side down. I don\u2019t have a solution for the latter.I love this thing, it\u2019s awesome and worth the purchase.",

The mattress that it comes with is very hard, I had to purchase a mattress separately for my baby to be more comfortable. And the mattress to fit it is very hard to find. The caddy is very easily removed as the clips do not hold it on firmly enough. The changing station is a bit flimsy but I like that it dries easily when wet.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased this for my 4 month old son. I wanted to put it beside my bed like the ad pictures. Now I\u2019ll start from the beginning. I got it very prompt as Amazon always is. I was able to assemble it quickly and without any issues. The crib/bassinet was much lower than my bed. I know beds are different heights but it still looks as if the ad pictures are a bit deceiving. I put a small quilt over the hard \u201cmattress\u201d which really just feels like cardboard with a little cushion. He has been sleeping in a dockatot but I know he will likely start rolling over soon so I was wanting to transition him to something different. I laid him in the middle of the bassinet at 9:30 asleep and in his sleep sack. He normally sleeps all night so when he started shifting around midnight I knew he wasn\u2019t comfortable. I watched him stretch and move a little but he was satisfied with a paci for a few minutes. He started moving around again and when I looked down he was face down in the mesh panel and the mattress part was tilted completely from his weight. He was completely wedged and was able to move. To say I was terrified is an understatement. I\u2019ve worked as an EMT and RN for 15 years. I\u2019ve seen children die unnecessarily for all types of reasons so I feel like I\u2019m slightly more in tune with products that are safe. Let me just say. I completely missed the mark with this one. I have never been more scared in my life. Not only am I reviewing and returning this product, but I am also going to email Amazon and request they remove this item from their services. I have never done anything like that but it is completely unsafe. My son has multiple abrasions to his head as well but he is alive and healthy. I\u2019m attaching a pictures and videos as well so hopefully others will heed my warning. After this incident last night , I did see someone else\u2019s review that included a video and it\u2019s completely accurate. I only wish I had seen that video sooner. Please please do NOT put your children at risk with this product.",
