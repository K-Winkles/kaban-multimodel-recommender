                "reviewText": "We love this crib! It was super easy to put together for my husband. Our little one is not ready for a full size crib yet, so we transitioned him from a bassinet to this mini crib at 4 months old while he is still in our bedroom. The crib is compact and fits right by our king size bed. The wheels make it portable and so easy to move around. We currently have it in the upper position and will lower once our son is a little older. As other reviewers mentioned, the 1\" mattress pad that comes with the crib is useless for the better word, but I don't think that should take away a star from the quality of the crib. Delta recommends a 2\" mini crib mattress, which are not too common. If anyone needs a recommendation, I personally purchased a 2 inch LA Baby 2 mattress, which perfectly fits this crib and is great quality for the price. Please note that we bought the grey color and out of the box it had a bit of a paint smell, but that quickly disappeared in a couple of days and is expected with painted wood, which is not a big deal. Overall this is a great quality sturdy little crib!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this bed to help my daughter who has Cerebral Palsy with my grandson while his father is at work. I had turned her bedroom into a craftroom after she got married a couple years ago and wasn't wanting anything that took up a lot of space. This bed is perfect for small spaces! My daughter in law says that this is what she will buy if she has another baby. The bed folds away easily and we have even taken it to my mother's (baby's great grandmother) house to use a few times. The bed does roll very easily on hard wood floors...so you should be careful laying baby down if you don't have the bed against a wall. But I would highly recommend this bed and would re-purchase!!! It has been a life saver for assisting my daughter while she is here and can easily fold away when she isnt!",

I love that it rolls, we can rock the baby back and forth if they\u2019re fussy. Can be folded up to make space, super easy to fold.",

                "reviewText": "It was pretty easy to assemble, easy instructions for folding to store. But instead of putting the caster wheels on I had to go buy adhesive felt furniture tabs to put on the bottom. The hole wasn\u2019t drilled the hardware to pop the caster wheel in wasn\u2019t there. I considered drilling a hole myself, but wild have had to gorilla glue the peg on the wheel to keep it installed. And without the wheels the legs scratched the floor.The mattress is also very thin, so will be replacing it. But it\u2019s as described in the description of the crib and mattress, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise.",

                "reviewText": "Had to wait a few months for the grey crib to go into stock again and it was worth the wait. You definitely need two people to assemble so you can easily hold everything into place. It didn\u2019t come with a screwdriver like some reviews said, just on for the two nut bolts for the baseboard. My husband and I used a butter knife for the rest of the screws lol. The instructions are hard to understand, but found this easy step by step instructional video on YouTube that got us through the whole process in about 20 minutes. Didn\u2019t find any scratches or chips. It slipped easily through my door and on the side of the bed. Still enough space to fit our diaper pailAlso we bought the dream on me 3\u201d mattress because the mattress that came was thin like the reviews say.",

My husband put it together and I was not there so I do not know anything about the assembly . I bought a mattress to use in it because of the other reviews and I am happy I did. The \u201cmattress\u201d that comes with it is so thin, I realize so you can store everything together but seriously folks buy a different one and just store beside the bed. Overall though I would definitely recommend and would buy again. Great product and price!",
