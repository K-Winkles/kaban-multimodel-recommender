                "reviewText": "***UPDATE***My daughter ended up using this for two years. It never sagged or got an indentation. It was so easy to clean and air dry. I only stopped using it when my daughter got too tall for a crib and I got her a twin bed.Another bonus - since this is such a high quality mattress, you can sell it when you're done. I sold mine at a local consignment sale for $50 after two years of use - so happy I got this and if I had another baby I'd buy a new one to bring them home from the hospital to.I never put any sheet or anything on it. I highly recommend HALO sleep sacks for babies and toddlers. No need for any sheets or blankets on the bed.***ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW***When my daughter was around 6 months old and learned to roll over, my husband and I were scared half to death to frequently find her face down, hands cupping her cheeks, during her naps. We would immediately turn her head to the side and a couple times she gasped for air when we did. Some people tried to assure me that, once babies can roll over, there's nothing to worry about when they sleep since they'll automatically turn their heads when they need air. However, after looking into it, I found research that babies who are used to sleeping on their backs, once they finally roll over and sleep on their stomachs for the first time, have a 20% or so higher chance of suffocating than infants who sleep on their stomachs from birth, because they aren't used to it and sometimes don't rouse themselves in time.We weren't able to sleep without constantly checking on her. I researched options and found the Newton breathable crib mattress. After reading everything on their website, I decided it was the one. It doesn't off-gas, it doesn't have chemicals, it's mostly air. We ordered it on Prime instead of from their website directly to get faster shipping. Once it arrived my husband and I, like others here, tested it by pressing our faces down against it and trying to breathe - it is a bit stuffy, of course, but you can breathe. And it doesn't smell like anything. No need to air it out before baby uses it.It is more firm than our \"firm\" crib mattress we were using previously. Our daughter doesn't leave any indent in it at all. It looks incredibly easy to clean; just use some cold water. It's some kind of polymer in a 3-D web. The cover is padded but has holes and layers so that it doesn't block air. Don't put any sheet or water-proof cover on this mattress, as that would block the air. It really doesn't need those things, since even if pee leaked or spit up got on it you just wash it off. It has nothing that could get moldy like other mattresses.Of course, we don't want to teach our daughter that it's okay to sleep with her face down, so if we find her like that, we do turn her head. But now we aren't constantly worried about her suffocating if we happen to not notice her being face down. For peace of mind, I highly recommend this mattress. We're going to move our daughter back to her original mattress once she's a toddler and save this one for when we have the next baby.",

                "reviewText": "Update: We have had this mattress for almost 2 years now, with continuous everyday use and at least 1-2 times a week of washing the cover. We still have the original cover from when we first purchased it- it's holding up great. Oxy Clean spray has taken out any yellowing from little nighttime accidents before I washed it. The inner core is doing well too!My son absolutely loves his mattress- he is almost 2 and has 3-4 hour long naps on it and 12 hours at night. On vacations it's a little rough because we can't take it with us- he doesn't sleep as good and it's really hard to get him to sleep without it (using a pack n'play mattress). If only Newton could make one for the pack n' play for travel!!My son also sleeps facedown.. literally.. and it's so nice to know he can BREATHE right through the mattress. So nice and reassuring for this worrisome momma!Original post:I love this mattress. Seriously, you cannot go wrong buying this mattress. Best Baby purchase we've made so far.Pros:1) Washable. Yes, WASHABLE!! Every single aspect of this mattress can be washed and cleaned. Pee on the mattress? No big deal, just zip off the mattress pad and throw it in the wash. The actual mattress part is a giant entanglement of biodegradable, safe plastic. When I first got the mattress in the mail, I soaked in the bathtub with some tea tree oil and then air dried it outside. Super easy.2) Made with quality materials. My baby sleeps on a mattress 8 hrs a day, so 1/3 of his time is on the mattress. I wanted something that wassafe (no fire retardants or PVC materials).3) Breathable. According to the website through their independent study (I understand this isn't maybe as factual as a 3rd party study, but still valid) they have found a way to significantly decrease the risk of SIDS death. This is immensely comforting as a first-time mom knowing that if my baby rolls over in the middle of the night, he can't suffocate while sleeping.Cons:1) Not cheap. This was a relatively expensive mattress. We tried to justify it by the pros and that he can use it in a toddler bed as well.All in all, LOVE THIS MATTRESS!!!",

                "reviewText": "LONG but honest & non sponsored review!!I was nervous about spending so much on a mattress especially when the videos I was watching on TikTok were all from people that are sponsored by newton. My 9 month old has been bed sharing with us since she was born & as safe as we are.. it has ALWAYS freaked me out.. but I\u2019m a breastfeeding mama & my daughter feeds often in the middle of the night or she\u2019ll wake up & cry for hours. SO we had to do what was best for us at the time! As she\u2019s gotten bigger, our bed seems to have gotten smaller lol I knew that I needed to make a change but wasn\u2019t ready to put her in her own crib in her room, & bassinets didn\u2019t work because she wasn\u2019t touching me & would again, wake up. We decided to do a car side crib but she\u2019s sleeping face down a lot & I have to turn her over constantly. I wanted something I could breathe straight through & not wake up every 5 seconds to check on her. I did a ton of research & everything kept leading me back to this mattress so I went for it & booooooy am I SO GLAD I DID!!! The hype is V E R Y real!!! I\u2019m so pleased with it & think it\u2019s worth every single penny. It\u2019s super easy to clean too!! I also highly recommend newton sheets \ud83e\ude77 very soft & super breathable!",

I saw a review on here that says it doesn't actually fit standard sheets, and that's just an outright lie. It's fit every sheet I've put on it with our very standard crib, including flannel. It's firm enough to give babies the support they need to grow bone and muscle density but are soft enough for them to sleep comfortably.",

He seems comfortable and since he became a stomach sleeper at 6 months I am not as concerned letting him sleep on his tummy with this mattress since it\u2019s breathable.I\u2019m using the Burt bees organic crib sheets on it and they fit great.It\u2019s also light so not the biggest deal that I have to lift each edge above bumper pads to change sheets. I would recommend this mattress , it took me a long time to figure out what to buy and I\u2019m happy that I went with a cheaper crib and a more expensive mattress.***update***My son is now 20 months old and this mattress is still fantastic. He turned into the biggest vomit machine and being able to zip the mattress cover off throw it into the wash has been everything! I can literally hose down the mattress too when needed. He can get really warm when sleeping and I can feel that he sleeps cooler on this compared to his baby bjorn travel crib when we travel. $400 is a lot but when I look back at some of the money I wasted on baby items this still remains a smart purchase. And since I\u2019m determined to never let him cosleep with me again , there have been some nights I have gotten into this crib to settle him down and fell asleep and I even found it comfortable!",
