We don\u2019t have any stairs in our house so being able to bring the bassinet with us where ever we go is extremely helpful and made is so we didn\u2019t need to get a bunch of other loungers.Also love the fact that it will grow with her.Easy to put together - directions are very straight forward",

                "reviewText": "So the many different usages and assembly options are a big plus. We started with the first one the bassinet, but are looking forward to the other options over the coming years.The bassinet has a low height, but just flipping the sides allows much higher bassinet as in their video. But some screws in where the holes are for safety.However, for the premium price they are charging the quality is not up to par. Many pieces have knicks from the production and the alignment is not good, in that there are larger gaps between pieces and some pain when trying to assemble as some pressure is needed to make the pieces fit.So the functionalities are great, but at the price point the quality is not (yet) good enough. I would pass on it at $600.",

Didn't even realize how convenient it would be to move around on wheels and pull close to the bed each night. Recently moved up to the midi size and it's still so light to be able to pull next to the bed each night. This crib is a game changer!",
