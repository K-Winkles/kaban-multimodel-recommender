                "reviewText": "We wanted a bassinet that has smooth swing operation, chose this bassinet over other standard ones for swing feature. This turned out to be a really poor quality and is nowhere near to acceptable standards! It started giving chemical odor as soon as we opened the box, was not able to get rid of that odor ever after a few days of keeping it open to air. Installing the parts was a nightmare, bolts are confusing and can make you think all are similar, but it has two different types. Took a long time (3 hrs) and a lot of effort to get this ready. This bassinet is not really built strong, always wobbly. I am awestruck with the low quality, ended up returning it.I buy a lot, but rarely write reviews. I wanted to share my experience to save new parents from choosing this low quality bassinet and save new born from having to feel uncomfortable with this product. My overall experience with this bassinet can be summaries as \u201cextremely poor quality, waste of time and money\u201d.",
