So far their little cavapoo has been the only one to try the crib out.",

(At least at the time I made my purchase) It is very sturdy and exceeds safety standards. I am extremely pleased.UPDATE: I have noticed a lot of comments stating the corners of the rails overlap at the top. I can understand why you might think this, I actually thought they had sent me the wrong rail at first! My father (way handier than I am!) explained that you had to pull the corners even while you tighten the screws connecting the rails. It has something to do with tension - don\u2019t ask me. Anyway, he was right and the corners line up perfectly!",

The eco-friendly, low VOC finish means it\u2019s safe and leave your nursery smelly. We have put together a few cribs and I feel like this was by far the easiest. The design is great, the crib is very solid, and it looks much more expensive than it actually was. We are pleased..",

                "reviewText": "Extremely happy with this crib. It is a bit time consuming to assemble, but on the bright side, seems like adjusting heights should not be too complicated. It looks very elegant and stylish, and we've had no complaints using it for the last 6 months. A standard crib mattress fits snugly. I will note that the white finish does get dinged somewhat easily (my older children have left scratches with toys), but for the money I think this is a great buy. Also like the fact that it includes the toddler rail, which many comparable cribs do not. Would definitely recommend to other parents. Part of the reason I decided to get the Scoot as opposed to the Lolly or some other Babyletto cribs is that the top rail is wood (as opposed to painted), which I prefer when the baby starts gnawing on it while teething.",

I thought I was missing pieces but it turns out the base is one whole piece, not 4 as listed in the instructions. More annoying than anything I get the impression I have a newer or older model. After taking twice as long to put this together, due to the instructions discrepancies, one of the legs became wobbly. I secured it with wood glue but definitely not what I would expect from an item of this quality. With all of the negativity out of the way, this is a very nice crib. Super sturdy and definitely high end. I may have just been a one off so I wouldn\u2019t let my review deter you from purchasing. Just be aware these issues can arise.",
