Plenty of size, very comfortable, sturdy quality material so was not afraid of placing her precious one once they arrive to sleep there throughout the night! Not much wrong I could say about it. Yes, I have seen some cheaper, but that's what they looked to be even in the pictures, cheap. Cheap materials and worrisome of how long they would last.

                "reviewText": "So most parents know just how EXPENSIVE bassinets can be, especially nice ones like this, so I am very glad to have found this! Such a good deal for a quality, mostly portable, sturdy and useful bassinet. I love the design-simple and classic. It is fairly quick and easy to assemble. I love that it is a bedside sleeper, can be used as a stand alone bassinet but also it has adjustable height and an incline feature- which comes in handy for colicky babies or babies with reflux. The mattress included is very soft and comfortable for baby. Babies sleep safe and sound because this is as good a quality, well made and ultra sturdy bassinet. This would make a great shower gift or anytime gift for new parents. It is a awesome deal and I highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Setting up this bassinet took less than 10 minutes! It's nice that the side rail drops down so you can use it as a bedside sleeper. The wood print frame looks very pretty in the listing photos, but it is more of a strong orange color in person. The height is easy to adjust between 5 different levels, spanning about 5 inches, so you can the one that works best for the height of your bed. Some bassinets offer a rocking feature but this one does not. The soft sided storage basket on the bottom is spacious and I like that the wheels can be locked in place. I can\u2019t imagine why I would need to use the mesh bug net, since it would be pretty bulky to take outdoors. I don't like that the solid part of the bug net does not stay up on its own, so either the whole thing is collapsed or you have it all the way covered up. I especially like that all the fabric is removable for easier washing! I wish all baby products were made this way. Overall, it's a reasonable bassinet to consider!",

The mosquito net really helped this summer when we were outside under the canopy but the mosquitos were getting bad. Not one got through the net it holds up great. The bassinet itself is made with very strong material and the wheels rolled really well on the cement. It\u2019s always a plus when there is a storage compartment underneath too. Highly recommend this bassinet",
