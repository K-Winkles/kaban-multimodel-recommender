They set it up with ease & are in love with it. She was surprised at how big it was & loves the side storage/diaper changing table next to it. If she\u2019s happy then I am happy with it.",

He is an engineer so if he had an awful time setting it up, I can't imagine what it would be like for others. Once it was all done, the crib is beautiful and very sturdy!! If you plan on buying it, have another person or 2 to help you set it up. It will save you time and stress.",
