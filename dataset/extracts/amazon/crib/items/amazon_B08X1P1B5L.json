                "reviewText": "This crib was fairly easy to put together, and I love that the hardware is brass colored. However, there was a little quality issue with the top piece of the headboard. The wood glue the manufacturer used was starting to fail, and this resulted in one wood piece separating from another at one end. Not a huge deal, and will only impact aesthetics and not safety. Should be an easy fix, but still something to be aware of.",
