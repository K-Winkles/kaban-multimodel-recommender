I sure hope they'll take them both back because now that it's assembled, one of the two I bought can't be unassembled.UPDATE: Since I bought two, and could not get the one apart, the seller offered to refund my money without my sending the rails back. The seller also asked us to send photos to show how the rails could be improved. I gave the seller a good review.",

This has been great and prevented many falls however, the assembly instructions are terrible and out of order. We ended up tossing the instructions as it is pretty self explanatory on how to assemble this.",

What I had a problem with was you have to assemble the pieces after you put the cover over the pieces and the instructions were not very clear.Once I got it put together I was very happy with the the end result. It is very sturdy and the cover/netting is made very well and the material is thicker than other rails I have seen. The buttons that allow the rail to be lowered are easy to use and convenient when you don\u2019t want the rail up.",
