                "reviewText": "I have a 2-week old and was losing hope with trying to get her to sleep on her own in a bassinet. We originally had a bare bones standalone bassinet that was too deep, large, and cold. She hated it and would wake out of a deep sleep the moment her butt touched the mattress. I purchased this bassinet as a last resort attempt and OMG it\u2019s fantastic. Not only is it nice to have her safely next to the bed, but it seems more comfortable for her to be laying in a smaller, more shallow space. The soft mattress is covered in a satin-like material, and the sides are perfectly sized to where it is safe but not oversized. I could go on. If you have a baby that throws a fit as soon as they leave your arms, try this out!!! I took a star away because there\u2019s basically zero storage space. Hope this helps.",
