Her crib is not a standard convertible crib-to-toddler bed so I resorted at first to putting her mattress on the floor, but after many sleepless nights realized she was rolling off the mattress and while it wasn\u2019t a hard fall, it was enough to wake her.ONE DAY after ordering this in desperation to create a safe type boundary in her crib again, it arrived and saved my sanity!It was VERY simple and straightforward to put together, which was amazing because I usually leave assembling things to my husband, but I was completely capable doing it by myself.Sturdy and secure and no problem with the fit to my hand-me-down crib that was made 20 years ago.",

                "reviewText": "This was a good option to convert our crib into a toddler bed. The installation is relatively easy, but probably takes 10-15 minutes to get everything put together. The sturdiness is pretty good and would have no issue keeping a kid from falling out of bed, but it's not rock-solid. If the kids were leaning on it sitting up it would rock back and forth. Not a huge issue, but it's definitely not as solid as the other wooden rail that we got for my other daughters crib conversionIt looked great at first but after a few months of use the white color definitely showed signs of wear. The top started to get discolored from the kids holding onto it and in the corner of the top where my daughter climbed in and out of bed the fabric did rip off leaving the metal bar underneath exposed. I guess some level of wear is to be expected but if I could do it again I might get the gray color which would hide some of the dirt that built up on the top of it. (Picture attached).",

                "reviewText": "So we ultimately returned this because it doesn\u2019t work with the IKEA crib. The bottom of the ikea bed/crib is covered in mesh and this needs to go over the rail and connect with a screw. The mesh prevents that. We didn\u2019t realize this until we\u2019d put this together.It was quick and easy to put together. All pieces were there. Size was perfect so she could still have climbed in and out. Stitching appeared to be good quality. I think if you have a wild sleeper, it\u2019ll inevitably break just given the nature of anything taking a beating. But otherwise it looked like it would keep my toddler in and be safe. I can\u2019t speak to anything else since we didn\u2019t get to use it, unfortunately.",

The bars are slightly flattened so you don't notice them under the mattress. The assembly is very simple. They include straps for the front so when you unlatch it to flip it down it stays strapped down, doesn't lift at all. We actually don't even flip it down because there is room on both sides to get in and out. Been using it for a couple weeks with no issues. Highly recommend if you can't get the original crib railing conversion",

First, you'll need to zip tie part of the rail underneath your mattress springs to ensure that the mattress even lies flat, because installing it as suggested results in the mattress having bumps in it from the metal rods under the mattress. I saw that in other reviews and thought, that's okay, despite it being a design flaw I don't mind the extra effort.Except that, in less than 6 months the fabric on the rail started to fray and come apart, and it's only getting worse by the day. I called the manufacturer, who offers a warranty, but because I bought from this re-seller they won't honour the warranty. And this re-seller doesn't even respond to emails to resolve the issue.Buyer beware.",
