                "reviewText": "These toddler bed bumpers are alright. They sometimes stay in place, but often end up half off my son's bed. They are lightweight and come with a pillowcase type cover that zips closed with a rubberized underside to help keep them in place. They are made of quality materials and seem durable. In my opinion, they need to be a bit heavier to better help keep them in place all night. My son is 2.5 years old, so he outgrew these not long after purchasing. I would say these bumpers are better suited for a younger child, as the older they grow, the stronger they become. He knocks them out of place in one push, so I will be handing them down to someone whose child is better suited size and age wise. I recommend this set of bumpers for younger children.",

I placed one on each side of my child's mattress, under the sheet so they don't move & they work great to keep her from rolling & smacking her legs along the rails. would work just as well if there was no rails. they are firm & hold up well, just needs at least 2 - 24 hours to allow them to puff up to size & then add the cover on. I love that the cover has a safety zip so kids can't open them & get to the foam. 100% would recommended.",
