                "reviewText": "When searching for a crib for our son, I wanted a crib that was good condition that would last through multiple children, nice looking, and affordable. I had never heard of this brand so I looked around for some reviews. It was hard finding many, but decided to purchase it anyways. I do not regret it at all. We've only had it for a short time so if anything bad happens after I write this review I will update it, but I was very pleased when I opened it up. It is a beautiful color, there were no scratches, all the pieces were there and it was fairly simple to put together. (About half way through I needed multiple hands). What I love most though is how sturdy it is. I thought maybe because it was on the cheaper end it would be pretty flimsy, but nope, it is rock solid. I love this crib and am excited to have it for our son. The only negative thing about this crib is that with the shape of the edges (the sides are wavy and the back is curved) it makes it hard to put a mobile up (at least the one that I have). But that isn't really a big deal. It has multiple levels which is nice because it is easier to lay our infant son down at the higher setting. Anyways, a good crib for a good price. I'd recommend it.",

The packaging did have a few rips and tears in the box, but the product was not damaged at all. We added this to our registry to match the changing table. We are very pleased with the look and sturdy feel of the crib. We\u2019ll update the review, if necessary if anything changes once were getting use out of the crib.",

All the parts fit, correct hardware and perfect finish.Prior to opening, the box in which the product arrived in was pretty battered. I thought to myself that the product itself was gonna be destroyed. Quite the contrary, I must say. I inspected the product throughly and was looking for missing items or an incomplete set.I think it has something to do with the placement of the protective packaging. It's a great buy but buyers be careful. Anything is possible even with an extreme amount of luck.The sturdiness of the finished product surprised me to say the least. Very firm as if it's one structure not pieced together.Spacious for infants and babies. Adjustments can be made as child age progresses.The crib adverts as 5 in 1 but for bed assembly requires items not included. This is a personal preference but I think this is fa.",

                "reviewText": "Update: I have converted the crib to a toddler bed and it was a fairly easy process. Make sure you hold on to the stabilizer bar when you first receive the crib because you will need that when you want to convert it later. The pieces you need to attach it are already being used to keep the side on - plus an allen wrench. I also added a Dream On Me Mesh Security Rail to keep my son from rolling out of bed at night because this crib did not come with a toddler rail. I like the fact that if I want to revert it to a crib I can throw the front back on in probably 20 minutes or less as long as I keep the parts. My only complaint is that I didn't realize how many exposed screw holes there would be on the newly bare inner sides. Not a safety issue but it is unsightly. Either way, the crib has held up to my rough toddler for over a year and is still in use so I'll stick to my 4 star review.Original Review: I purchased this crib for my 22 month old because I plan on converting it to a toddler daybed in the upcoming months, but for the time being I have it set up as a regular crib at the lowest mattress setting. I will update my review when I convert it to include my thoughts on using it as a toddler bed.Others have noted that the espresso color was not true espresso but in my opinion it is close enough. It looks like a rich dark brown and my particular crib has no hints of red in the coloring but it should be a tad darker. With low lamp lighting the crib looks darker than it looks in natural daylight.My crib also arrived with a deep scratch on one of the top rail parts, which is one reason I cannot give it 5 stars. Another reason I only give it 4 stars is because I actually purchased the Dream On Me 96 coil mattress to go along with this crib since they are the same brand and should be compatible, but the mattress is about an inch shorter in length than it should be to fit snugly. That spacing doesn't make much of a difference being that my baby is now a toddler, but if I had a newborn I might be concerned that the mattress is not snug enough in all directions.Otherwise, the crib is very nice to look at and appears to be very sturdy. It took an hour to put together and I would have been able to do it alone but for one part of the assembly I needed another person to come hold the parts up, so having somebody to help you may be necessary. Mine came with instructions but a few of the parts were missing labels and the instructions did not tell you where to put the included dowels. I ended up putting them in the inner holes that were only indented on one side of the wood, maybe this is common knowledge but it wasn't to me and I had to guess. The crib comes with an extra stabilizer bar to replace the front side at its lowest level for when you convert it to a toddler bed but does not come with a toddler bed rail.For the price (under $150) this was definitely a worthwhile purchase and works well for my needs at the moment. My son enjoys his new crib which is the most important feature for me.",

                "reviewText": "I had purchased this crib 5 years ago when my first son was born, and used it up until the toddler bed stage. Now that my son is older, he has a different bed while I am using the crib for my second baby. Through the years I had lost some of the hardware for the crib setup, and contacted customer service to receive a replacement and their service was fast and efficient! I plan to convert the crib to the adult bed once my daughter is done needing the toddler phase, and my son will be ready for a bigger bed. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the crib and the customer service!",
