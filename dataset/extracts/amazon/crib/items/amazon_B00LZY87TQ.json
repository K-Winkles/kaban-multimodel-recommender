                "reviewText": "I can not say enough good things about this crib! My husband & I researched cribs for months. My biggest concerns were shipping damage & buying a sturdy crib. We decided on this one because it's soooo beautiful & the reviews we saw were all saying that the crib was packaged well for shipping. Let me tell you, it was packaged VERY well. I was so nervous to open it because when it arrived, it had huge gashes in the box (I attached pictures). We were happy to find that it was all insulated in styrofoam & each item was wrapped. It had a tiny dent in it that ended up against the wall anyways. You risk dents & more even getting it from a store. We live in the middle of nowhere & the nearest large retail stores are almost 2 hours away so amazon seemed like the best bet for options. Assembly was a breeze. Took under 30 minutes for my husband to put it together. All I did was hold pieces up. This bed is VERY sturdy. We are very impressed & so excited to put our little one in it. For the other comments complaining about chemical smells, we did not experience this until we had the door closed to the room it was in for a few days. Once we opened the door, the smell went right away. The room doesn't have any windows & only has 1 vent for air flow so as long as you don't plan on closing off the room, you won't have any problems. It was closed due to the fact that I didn't want our cat to pee on the mattress before I got a sheet protector. Anyways, we could not be happier with this purchase. As a second time Mom, I love this crib so much more than my first one. Definitely worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "My husband put this crib together with ease. The packaging was very all organized and the directions were explained well too. Obviously you want to keep in mind that not all the holes will be used for the crib, as this is a 4-1 style. Husband used his drill to assemble and it probably took him 30-45min to assemble!I can understand why the smell of the crib would be bothersome to so many, but truthfully it's no different when you have furniture arrive from a retail store. Our baby is due in June, so I think with adequate planning, if you're sensitive to smell or that new furniture smell, if you buy ahead of time like we did then the smell should disappear in time. I also routine sage my home and have a defusser going daily.. if you're planning to get a humidifier, then get one that also acts as a defusser, and help with that chemical smell sooner rather than later.Overall, the appearance is everything I was hoping for. You can adjust the height of the crib so you're not bending over so low if that's a concern you have. It's very sturdy, husband approved that it's not flimsy by any means. My guests that I've had over cannot believe all my furniture in my nursery, I bought through amazon. And I got the crib, dresser, beautiful rocking chair(none of which look or were cheap!) Along with some other smaller items for 1k. You can't beat that if you're on a budget.I was worried how the delivery would be or if pieces would be damaged and thankfully, none were! I hope my little one loves it as much as I do!",

                "reviewText": "Pros: Super cute. Solid wood. Really easy for an almost 9 month, high risk, pregnant woman to put together by herself (me!). The price is really nice too. Most solid wood cribs this quality would be $400 or more in store. See below for why it's 4/5.Cons: Put this together and one of the top railings (front and back are interchangeable) cracked as I screwed it together. The metal screw bracket inside the piece was the issue, it was not made correctly and was stripping the screws which caused the crack. Unscrewing it would cause the metal screw bracket to come out of the railing board.Customer Service: I reached out to their Customer Service to get just the one part replaced. I didn't want to have to disassemble the entire thing and put together an entire new crib. The front/back top railings are really easy to take on/off without taking anything else apart. They were really easy to work with and ordered a replacement part within a week of emailing them. They quoted 7-14 business days to receive the replacement, but we received it within 5 days. Unfortunately another one of the metal screw brackets in the replacement part was also stripping the screws. We knew better than to try to screw it in all the way this time, to avoid cracking the wood again. Fortunately my husband's father was able to fix the metal bracket piece, so we'll be able to just use that instead of going through Customer Service again. It was probably just unfortunate luck that we got two defective pieces. It wouldn't make me recommend this product any less to someone else, but I would just say be wary, if the screw isn't going in easily, don't force it, it's defective and will probably cause damage to the wood.",
