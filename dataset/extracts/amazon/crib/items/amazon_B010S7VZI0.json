                "reviewText": "FIRST please read this:100% Polyurethane Foam Has been banned in it\u2019s pre-regulated form since 2004, and has not been used in these graco mattresses. There\u2019s a review here for this mattress that is scaring parents off and claiming it\u2019s made of the 100% Polyurethane Foam that constantly offgasses toxic chemicals. The same person states that she did tons of research but I have to assume she just googled \u201c 100% Polyurethane Foam\u201d and freaked out. While this mattress is made from Polyurethane Foam, it has been GREENGUARD GOLD certified, which means it has been approved by several of the most reputable agencies in the world for an acceptable amount of offgassing. What this means, is that in an indoor environment where there is little to no ventilation, this mattress offgases an extremely low level of chemicals, low enough that it does not cause abnormalities or expose any safety risks to your little one. If you research 100% Polyurethane Foam, there are some scary facts about it, but if you also research what it means that a mattress is GREENGUARD CERTIFIED, there is extensive tests done to make sure It is safe. This mattress is not only GREENGUARD certified, it is GREENGUARD GOLD certified which makes it even higher up in the list for safe, low emission foam mattresses.Please do your own research on BOTH 100% Polyurethane Foam, and the GREENGUARD GOLD CERTIFICATION requirements before some Random person on the Internet convinces you that something is not safe when there have been amazing scientists and children\u2019s health advocates researching and improving materials for over a decade specifically to ensure the safety of our children.Now, if you wanna know about the mattress itself:The one I received took a full FOUR AND A HALF DAYS To fully inflate for us, for about a day and a half or so I was totally convinced that I was going to be one of those unlucky people who got one that just wouldn\u2019t inflate all the way no matter what I did. But, it did eventually fluff up to the full stated height/width/thickness. I did not notice a weird smell once fully fluffed up nor when we first opened it. I guess my best piece of advice is just to be patient with it, even if it takes longer than the 48-72hrs. It fit in my daughters crib absolutely snug, the literal perfect size. Sheets fit great, and she has been sleeping on it great. She is a wiggler in her sleep and will often go from sleeping on her back, to her tummy, side to side. She seems to be very comfortable in this mattress, and will switch positions without waking up in discomfort. It\u2019s great for her and firm enough that I would be confident using it for a newborn.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best Baby Mattress Ever! Perfect fit, ideal balance of comfort and firmness, and no plastic cover. Never buying anything else.",
                "reviewText": "I love this mattress! It's the best baby mattress I have ever seen. I initially bought this mattress to put in a crib at my in-laws' house for occasional use. I wanted something inexpensive, very comfortable, and not covered in plastic or vinyl. We loved it so much, we ended up getting another one for the crib at home too.There are several features that I really love about this mattress. Most importantly, it's the perfect combination of comfort and firmness for a baby. I don't know how Graco managed to do it. It must be magic. But it feels so soft and cradling when you touch it or press on it, and yet it's somehow firm enough not to let the baby sink into it at all. Even my 38 lb preschooler doesn't sink in when she lays on it. I want a safe mattress, but not one that feels hard. I want my baby to be comfortable. This mattress is perfect.Another awesome feature is the fact that it fits exactly right in the crib. No gaps. Our old crib mattress fit pretty well in the sense that there were no large gaps around the edges, but this mattress you have to press just a little to get it in place and it's snug all the way around. And not only that, but the edges and corners are square so there's no empty space in the corners either and it doesn't round over on the edges. Maybe I'm just weird, but there's something satisfying about a proper fit like that and a very flat surface that doesn't make the baby roll to the edge or toward the middle. It's also safer for babies not to have any way to get stuck between the mattress and the side of the crib.I love the fact that there's no plastic cover. It does mean it's not waterproof, only water resistant. But I will take that trade in a heartbeat because I hate the noise and feel of those vinyl-covered mattresses. This one is so inviting.The mattress is made of a single block of foam. Because it's only water-resistant, I used a waterproof mattress cover on it, but I don't think you would have to. The water resistant feature comes from a liner over the foam that feels something like the material you might find on the outside of a windbreaker jacket or a pair of snow pants. It's very thin and flexible and fabric-like, but kind of shiny and wouldn't let water through very well. There's another cover over that which is stretchy and has a textured feel and it makes it so you can't really tell there's a slicker, water resistant layer underneath. And on top of that, there's a third cover that is very soft fabric. All 3 covers have zippers and completely cover the mattress all the way around. They're easy to remove if you need to. The innermost cover would probably need to be handwashed as I don't think it would hold up in the washer, but it might just wipe off unless there was a lot of liquid. The other covers seem durable enough to go in the washer. The overall effect with all the covers on is much like the surface of an adult's mattress - soft fabric feel over foam.The mattress ships tightly compressed and rolled in a box. You just remove the box and plastic packaging, unroll it, and let the foam expand. I recommend taking all the covers off to let the foam expand properly, without binding up inside the covers, and so it gets plenty of air. It only took about 4-5 hours to take its normal shape, but we left it for about 24 hours before we put the covers back on and used it. I didn't notice any chemical smell at all.My baby girl sleeps great on this mattress and I'm very happy with it. The only thing I don't know yet is how well it will last. It has a 6 year warranty and it seems plenty durable, but time will tell. Even if it only lasts a couple of years, I would buy it again at this price.",

                "reviewText": "I have to say that I couldn't be more impressed with this mattress. We first bought one for our oldest. She is soooo hard on mattresses. She is on the autism spectrum, and sleep in general is a real challenge. She ruined several of her \"baby\" mattresses from jumping. A year or so ago, I knew it was time to upgrade for more comfort, but that she'd still need a crib-sized mattress for her little bed......I chose this one. Today, it is still in perfect condition! Once she goes to sleep, she sleeps really, really, well on this mattress. After seeing how well the first one was going, I recently decided to purchase one for our 18 month old who is still in the crib. He also is \"sleeping like a baby.\" I love the texture/feel of the mattress, as well as the cover. I also love that it's greengold certified. I am very health-conscious, and I will admit that I was still a little unsure if this mattress fully met the standards I strive for or not. I always prefer to see \"certified organic\" on items, but I knew the greengold certified was in the right direction for sure. However, I read a very well-studied, explained, review from another customer on here that gave me more assurance in this last little area. I truly think good strides were made in creating this mattress, and I truly don't see any better options out there. I say - don't overthink it, just buy it. I think you'll be glad you did. I am very pleased with it and would definitely recommend it to others!",
