The travel bag is so nice and easy to carry as it has a shoulder strap, not just a handle & we love that all is included. Super simple to set up & down. We love the fact that when we get home all will both blend in nicely with our home's decor, and also grow with our baby (we have just used the bassinet mode so far but love that all can transform into a crib and playpen design). Highly recommend for both use at home and travel.",

Super annoying to dismantle and feels twice the weight of the Silver Cross Slumber 3-in-1 Travel Crib when packed up.",
