The railing is super easy to switch out, and doesn't require a full disassembly of the crib or anything, which was a huge blessing, since I was making the switch at 30ish weeks pregnant. Super easy transition, and so grateful I didn't need to buy her a whole new bed!",

My only complaint is that since it comes as 2 pieces and must be screwed together in the middle(one nut/bolt and one dowel pin), if you put any pressure on the middle once installed, it will bend/flex and could possibly break. I am going to take it back apart and glue the wood dowel pin in the middle. That should add a little more strength.",
