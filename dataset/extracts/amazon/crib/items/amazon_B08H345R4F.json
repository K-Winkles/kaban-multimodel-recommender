                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful Crib",
                "reviewText": "I was a bit worried about ordering a crib from Amazon, but the crib was delivered safely and nothing appeared to be broken upon inspection.It was fairly easy to put together although I would recommend to have a 2nd person to help just to make sure you dont break or bend anything while screwing it together.The crib is fairly lightweight, made from soft wood (I think pine?), but so far it seems sturdy enough. We have only had it for a few months and our baby is still little but our 3.5 year old will sometimes lay in it for pretend play and it holds him just fine as well.The size is pretty standard and same with the mattress height settings. We keep it pushed up against our bed and the crib mattress is just maybe 2 inches below the top of our mattress which was the same with our previous crib.Due to the lightweight, it might shift easily on hardwood floors, so if you're looking to use it as a co-sleeper next to your bed I would recommend to either have it pushed up against a wall or put a rug underneath to make sure it wont get pushed away from your bed especially when baby gets more mobile.The design of the crib is probably my favorite thing about it. Its just gorgeous. I love the mid-century modern design and the price is just right. Compared to other similar cribs out there, I cant see why you would pay more.I like the round spindles too. My baby has gotten his hands or legs caught between them a few times which is always a risk with cribs like these but since the spindles are round he didnt get hurt at all, just stuck.It's also nice that the short sides are solid, this helps keep light and direct air flow (like from a fan or AC) from waking your baby.The only negative thing I'd say is that there arent more color options. We ordered the olive green which is beautiful especially in contrast with the pale wood spindles, but a dark blue would have gone better with the rest of our bedroom. Would love to see the company offer more color choices to fit everyone's taste.",

                "reviewText": "This crib is amazing! I was able to put it together by myself at almost 8 months pregnant, so I think anyone can do it. Instructions are easy to follow and the color is true to the photo. I feel like I got the crib of my dreams and my nursery is coming along beautifully now. So happy! Also didn't know that it turns into a toddler bed and full bed as well until I received the box! My little man will be able to use this bed for a long time. Love this crib better than the Delta crib I had for my daughter before.",

It does have some off gassing so give yourself a month or so to have it together before baby arrives. We purchased the olive green one.",

The only downside is that the paint scratches really easily and I wish they didn\u2019t put all those stickers on it since they\u2019re impossible to remove without leaving adhesive.",
