The pebble grey color goes nicely with our nautical decor. While I'll only be using this as a crib for now, I love that it's so versatile and can convert to various-staged beds. I found it relatively easy to assemble. The instructions were easy to follow and I didn't really run into any issues, although there were a couple times having another person would've been handy. It only comes with parts for the crib, so you do have to purchase a conversion kit if/when upgrading into a bed. Either way, I still find this to be a great value. It looks and feels solid and sturdy. My sister came down after I finally finished assembling it (I started & stopped a few times), and she absolutely loves it. In fact, she likes it better than the more expensive one she'd purchased for his nursery. I can't wait to get the mattress pad in and finish decorating. I'll update this if I come across any issues, but I'm really happy with it so far.",

                "reviewText": "When I first unpacked this, there was an odor, but it disappeared a couple of days later. I put the crib together by myself; however, there are a couple of screws, making it very difficult to work with. These screws are too close to the edges, and the Alen key doesn't fit. So, you need to rotate the screw a little, remove the tool, and put it back in. They could move these holes less than an inch, which would have been perfect. So, this is just a design flaw, and it doesn't change the fact that the product quality is good.Based on my experience, I can recommend it, but there is a minor inconvenience when assembling the crib.",

                "reviewText": "We bought the Dream on Me Milton 5-in-1 convertible crib because of its versatility as well as its use of sustainable materials like the New Zealand Wood and water based paint. The crib seems to be very well made and designed. Assembly was very easy and can be done by just one person. However, it did take a bit of time. One thing to note as it probably is a bit confusing to many is that this product only contains the parts for an infant crib. If you want to convert the crib into a toddler or youth bed, you need to purchase a separate conversion kit which you can buy on the manufacturers website. The white paint of the crib really looks nice and the classic and elegant design of the headboard really make it stand out. It has a standard crib size, so any standard crib mattress will fit, but also needs to be purchased separately. Overall, this is a great quality, sustainable, and versatile convertible crib that will last a long time. At over $300 at the time of this review it is a pretty good value considering the quality and sustainability of the product.",

                "reviewText": "I am really pleased with the look and quality of this crib! It was packaged very well, and arrived without any dents, knicks or chips. The paint is like a semi-gloss and is smooth to the touch and very easy to wipe clean.While the individual parts are not very heavy, it is cumbersome to put together by yourself. Thankfully, there were two of us and that made the job much easier. All parts and hardware pieces are labeled, and the instructions are clear. The only tool required for assembly is an Allen wrench / hex key which is included with the hardware pack. It\u2019s also good to have a flat head screwdriver on hand in case you need to secure the barrel nuts while tightening. From unpacking to final display, it took us about an hour.Should you want to see the instructions prior to purchasing, the company\u2019s website has them available for download on the product page.Overall, I highly recommend this crib. The price point is fair, the neutral color is great, and since it\u2019s convertible, it can be adapted as your child grows. I am really pleased with this crib and the fact that the little one will be able to use it for many years to come!",
