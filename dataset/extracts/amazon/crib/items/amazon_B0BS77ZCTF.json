The paint quality is also good. After assembling, the crib is not too heavy and you can move it from one room to another with little effort.3. How easy are they to assemble - On a scale of 1-10 (1 being \u201cwhy did I buy this\u201d and 10 being extremely easy) I would give them a solid 7. They are not difficult to assemble. The package will have some 15 odd parts with all the screws you\u2019d need and the time it took me to assemble this from scratch was 50 mins. The instructions are straight forward, diagrams are easy to understand and everything just fits well.4. Any negatives - While assembling, be a little careful as to not drop anything sharp (like screws) on any of the parts. If that happens, it will create a small dent.Will definitely recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I really love this crib! I needed a second crib for my bedroom that didn\u2019t take up much space and I have to say that I surprisingly prefer this one over the $1200 crib I have in the nursery! I love that it\u2019s small and has a low profile which makes easy to reach my child way down at the bottom notch and also very easy to move from place to place around the room. It\u2019s not quite as sturdy as my other crib (perhaps that\u2019s because it\u2019s so much lighter than my other one) but it\u2019s still plenty sturdy enough for my 20 month old and I expect to get many more years of wear out of with more babies. I love how to has a clean design which goes with any decor. It\u2019s a really great crib and I can see myself getting lots of use out of it. I honestly wish someone would have advised me to purchase something like this prior to me purchasing my first and (over priced) crib. This one is great and you can\u2019t beat the price for the quality! I was definitely impressed! Hubby put it together in about 90 minutes.",

                "reviewText": "Disclaimer: I've only had the bed for a week. That being said, this crib is perfect for those of us out there that are vertically challenged (short) This crib sits much closer to the floor than any crib I've had. If you're looking to store stuff under the crib, this one won't work for you. There is probably only a 6-12\" clearance at the bottom. In other cribs, when I had the mattress set to the lowest position, I could not reach my child if they were laying down. May not sound like a big deal, but when they puke in the middle of the night and are still half asleep, they aren't real good at taking orders to stand up. I'd have to wake my husband to come grab them up for me. Most crib heights would to right below my breasts. I'm 5'1\". This bed is only waist high. It's so nice to have my child easily accesible to me. It also isn't as dominating in the room, making the space look bigger. We bought the gray colored crib and it really looks nice. Doesn't look cheap at all. The crib is very solid. I put it together by myself and it took a hour. I probably could have been quicker, but I was assembling it in a tight space which isn't easy at 33 weeks pregnant. I'm very happy with this purchase and see no reason why it won't last till I'm done needing a crib.",

Showed up on time with mild damage to one of the boxes but the cribs are well packed in styrofoam and foam wrap so no issues with any damages. Struggled for over an hour putting the first one together as the diagrams in the manual weren't the greatest, but put the second one together in 26 minutes so I guess practice does make perfect. Cribs are only 34\"high which makes for easy access for my wife who is 5' 3\". There is a bit of an odour to the cribs so it's a good idea to get them built early and let them air out a bit. Overall they are very simple and understated but solidly built and a great price.",
