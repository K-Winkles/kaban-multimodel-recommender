                "reviewText": "My wife and I were looking for a crib that we could eventually convert to a toddler bed. Most of the cribs we looked at already cost a couple hundred of dollars and that did not include the conversion kit. These conversion kits were $150 to $200. We understand that we're saving because we don't have to buy an additional bed when they outgrew the crib. For us the total cost was a lot more than we were willing to spend.We came upon this crib and it was everything we were looking for. It wasn't bulky and yet still a full size crib. There are multiple styles of beds it can be made into without an additional kit.Assembly couldn't have been easier, maybe it could have been if one of my hands wasn't in a cast. I put this crib together by myself with basically one hand.",

                "reviewText": "We are now almost 6 months into using this crib and in fact just bought another one for a new baby we had. This is one of the cheaper cribs on the market and I truly don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s sturdy and has held up to my now 16 month old trying to shake the rails and climb it. The shape is also pretty adorable and I like that all 4 sides have rails so no worries of baby putting their face up to the back and not being able to breathe. I don\u2019t think other cribs are worth the price when this one is great and much less expensive than most others.",
