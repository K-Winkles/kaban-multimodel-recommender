                "reviewText": "This crib is everything that we expected and the customer service was fantastic. Unfortunately, it took us a few weeks to be able to put it together in order to use it because we had a damaged piece. We reached out to the customer service team at the company and they were quick to respond and resolve the issue in a timely manner. They got the replacement part out to us as quickly as possible and the representative who we dealt with was in constant contact with us about the status of the replacement part up through delivery. Once we received the part, the assembly process was pretty simple and the instructions were easy to follow. Putting this together took about 45 minutes to an hour and it took both my wife and I to put it together but 1 person could put it together, if needed. We love how this looks in our room and now are son has a nice sturdy bed to lay in. We would recommend buying a new mattress, that\u2019s specifically for mini cribs, as the one that came with it was way too thin. If you\u2019re looking for a crib to fit in small spaces and one that converts to grow with your child then this is the crib for you. Also, if you have any issues with missing parts or damaged pieces, reach out to the company as they will rectify the issue as fast as they can. The company seems to want to make sure that their customers are satisfied with their products.",

                "reviewText": "It looks great but assembly was a mess, the pieces have the same holes on different sides but aren't clearly marked which side goes inward or outward so we ended up taking it apart multiple times to make corrections. Also, the bed height is determined before completion so now that I know it needs to be lowered I will have to take it partially apart to adjust this. There was a piece of tape on 1 of the legs, when we removed it thinking it was from the packaging we realized it was actually painted over so the paint came off. Overall it's not bad once it's assembled but think about the design if you plan to add crib bumpers because there's no way to attach them to the back panel.",

                "reviewText": "We needed a crib that could have its front removed so we could convert it into a sidecar cosleeper. We put the mattress at the highest setting and then ziptied the crib to our bed frame which has worked fantastically. I really appreciate how the back is solid so nothing slips down behind the crib and it will hopefully look less like a crib convert when installed as a headboard. The crib sides are a bit thick so we weren't able to install the mobile we have but it is very sturdy which is more important than mobile-friendliness.I had a few minutes of irritation when the box arrived since the label said \"3-in-1\" instead of the \"4-in-1\" we ordered and I was afraid that the mattress height wasn't adjustable like the 4-in-1. Everything was fine but some clarification in the description would be nice.This crib was much easier to assemble than a previous crib we put together from the same brand. The screws had fewer pieces (no washers needed) despite there being the same number of wooden pieces. Like other reviews have pointed out, some of the pieces were mislabeled and the instructions did not make things much clearer. For reference, we've put together a lot of IKEA furniture that does not come with worded directions and IKEA directions were easier to understand than this crib's directions. If this brand would put out a step by step video for assembly it would be great.Overall, the product is good and we got exactly what we needed. The company could take some steps to make clearer directions and packaging.",
