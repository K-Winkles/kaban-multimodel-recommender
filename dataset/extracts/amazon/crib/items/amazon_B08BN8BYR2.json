Once baby is crawling, they can be removed so you can use the playpen. Holds up to 35 pounds (others similar products hold up to 25 lbs.)",

The playard is incredibly versatile, with a bassinet, changing table, and playpen all in one. This makes it really convenient for parents, as you don't have to buy separate pieces of furniture for each function.The playard is also really easy to set up and use. It's foldable, which makes it easy to store when not in use, and the wheels make it easy to move around the room. The mattress is also really comfortable, which is great for babies and toddlers.Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase. The Pamo Babe Playard Deluxe Nursery Center is a great choice if you're looking for a versatile, easy-to-use playard that has everything you need for your baby or toddler. If you're a busy parent who wants to save space and money, this playard is definitely worth checking out!",

It is also a little hard to hook things on the top. My daughter and I were able to do it, but my elderly mother would not be able to. Seems sturdy and is very sharp looking!",
