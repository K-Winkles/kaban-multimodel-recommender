I think the one thing you could add to the page for the crib would be a side link to make it easier to find the conversion pieces. I have yet to find the toddler bed concersion piece.",

The bottom drawer is a bit small, but we use it solely for jammies on one side and accessories like socks, hats, bibs on the other. Love this crib. Hope to save it in case I ever have anymore kids and use it for them as well. Also like the changing table. We keep her changing supplies in a basket and lots of blankets etc\u2026 on the shelves. We are on limited space and I feel like it\u2019s perfect for us",

We love the room and the shelves with the changing table. It\u2019s very sturdy as well. The only downside was that it did not have all the hardware and we had to go to Ace to buy hardware.",

                "reviewText": "Seems very sturdy and well made. Time and toddler will tell! The color is beautiful.Very well packed. The box arrived in horrible condition. Looked like it had been banged around a lot in shipment, may have done battle with a forklift. Corners were crushed, there were a couple of big holes, and the tape had come loose in several areas. It's very very heavy, and the poor delivery driver carried it to the door in a pouring rain. But the crib itself was in perfect condition.Something to be aware of - the changing table can only be attached to the right side. We were hoping to be able to choose the side it went on, but no joy on that. Also, the drawer is shallow. But it holds little baby size diapers and wipes or receiving blankets and sheets, so it's useful.",

It's very well made, and came with very good hardware and every tool needed.I would say my only complaint would be the instruction manual, it was all pictures literally no word describing directions so that made it a little harder for my husband and I were able to do it in under 2 hours, considering I'm 8 months pregnant I wasn't too much help to him LOLI would recommend this crib to ANY parents expecting. For the price it's absolutely amazing and better than I could have expected!!!!",
