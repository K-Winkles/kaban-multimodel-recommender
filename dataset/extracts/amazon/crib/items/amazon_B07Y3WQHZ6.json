I thought I would have to return it but to my surprise it was durable, looks gorgeous and fairly easy to assemble. Now he is 5 months old and still zero complaints for this crib. It is very study, easy to adjust the mattress and looks great- no paint chipping, dents nothing. I am glad I purchased this and I was able to purchase some higher priced items for him without spending an arm and let on a crib. Very good value and I would highly recommend this product without hesitation.",

Surprised that it didn't come broken or scratched because of delivery. No weird smells. I actually put this together myself with no help. It took me about 45 mins. The instructions was easy to understand and there was no missing parts. Parts were labeled and well organized, especially the tools/hardware. Love that it came with it's own tools so I didn't have to use any of mines. The crib itself is sturdy and simple. I also love it bc since I'm short, I can place my baby in crib without hurting my back. So if you are looking for a cute, simple crib, and it doesnt take up space, easy to put together, this is it! I would recommend this crib. \ud83d\udc4c",
