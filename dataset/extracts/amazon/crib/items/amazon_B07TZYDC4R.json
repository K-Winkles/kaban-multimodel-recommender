                "reviewText": "Happy to say that after a TON of research I am so very pleased with my purchase! I got 2 of these in \u2018natural\u2019 for my twins and they are absolutely adorable and sturdy. I put them together myself, in about 2 hours give or take but it would\u2019ve taken me less time if I didn\u2019t have to stop periodically to tend to a baby. Everything was packaged super safely and all parts were accounted for. I don\u2019t like to tell people what to do but please take my advice: for the love of all that is good and holy HAVE SOMEONE HELP YOU WITH INSTALLING THE METAL SPRING SUPPORT...otherwise you\u2019ll be questioning why your kids can\u2019t just sleep on the floor and what you could\u2019ve possibly done in your life to cause this multitude of karma all while you mutter every swear word concoction you can think up bc the Allen wrench flings out of your fingers more times than you can count. So thankful that the highest setting is still pretty low so I won\u2019t have to move it anytime soon. Other than that debacle, assembly was smooth. For the money it\u2019s a great deal, two top corners on one of the cribs have small gaps where you can kind of see the pins (as seen in the pictures) bc the pieces aren\u2019t flush and better attention to the wood grain and \u2018staining\u2019 could\u2019ve happened for it to look more \u201cput together\u201d and seamless but overall those are just minor flaws that I don\u2019t particularly worry about in this case. The wood is not soft at all, slightly heavy but not in a bad way. Would totally purchase again if I needed to \ud83d\ude01",

The most time consuming part was just twisting all the screws into place. All of the parts and screws were very clearly labeled which made things so much easier. It feels very sturdy once put together and looks just like the picture!",

                "reviewText": "Negative reviews are wrong.... I spend a VERY long time researching cribs. (2 months) My baby was using a pack n' play for a few months, but was outgrowing it. I liked the breath-ability of the pack n' play since it had mesh on the sides. But It was time to upgrade.I previously purchased a graco crib with a solid back, but I returned it because: 1.) It was extremely high off the ground. Even on its lowest setting. 2.) The solid backing made me feel very uncomfortable with the lack of airflow. So with this crib I wanted something low to the ground similar to the pack n' play. I wanted something, modern, solid built. Its beautiful and modern looking, without being too much. Very solid. I had my hesitations when putting it together, but once built its VERY solid. My baby loves this crib and sleeps so much better now. I feel safe with the rails all the way around knowing there is ample airflow. I cant say enough positive things about this crib. If your hesitating, don't! Order. Its BEAUTIFUL and you wont regret it. plus, Assembly was so easy!Update*** LOVING THIS CRIB. My baby has kicked and hit the bars and there has been no damage. I recently walked though IKEA and could not believe how much better quality this crib is. Their cribs wobbled. This crib is SOLID! So pleased with my purchase and will recommend to anyone who need a sturdy well made crib!*** Second update: Make sure you purchase crib rail liners before your baby starts teething lol.",

We were too, although it is for an optional thing so it wasn\u2019t necessary.Also, as another reviewer had experienced there were posts on the metal portion the mattress sits on that prevented the attachments from being able to be attached from the frame. It was about 1.5 inches too short on both sides. This wasn\u2019t discovered until the last step.Rather than take it apart and send back or try to get another one I had to drill out the posts to have the adjustable metal portions be able to be positioned to attach this portion to the frame.Needless to say this isn\u2019t reasonable. I would suggest buying a different crib from another manufacturer.",
