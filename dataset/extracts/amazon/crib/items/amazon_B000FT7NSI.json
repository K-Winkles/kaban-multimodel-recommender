                "reviewText": "Was looking for a crib/bed for the new addition to the family and not trying to break the bank while doing it. I mean unless you have multiple kids the use you get out of just a crib is about 2 to 3 years top and the kiddo needs a bed. So looked around at babies r us and buy buy baby and OMG the price they have for theirs is ridiculous!! Thats when I turned to the internet and came across this one. I am prime member so in two days had it delivered. Was pretty simple to put together. I used my 12 V drill to speed things up along with a flat head screwdriver. The instructions say not to use a drill but as long as you have it on a low tight setting you will be fine. The only headache was the bolts. The bolts are different sizes and I kept using the wrong bolts for the wrong holes so, I would have to take a part and put the right bolts to the right holes. Of course not the products fault for me not paying attention, but I don't know why there are different sizes one size would be just fine for all of them, but I digress. So, about an 1 1/2 hours of assembly time. Probably would have shaved off 20 minutes if not the for bolt mix up. I am very pleased with finished product. Looks as good if not better than the department store cirbs. Seems sturdy and ready for the challenge of a bouncing baby boy! I will write again in a few months after the baby gets here and tests it out. Hope this helps....*Update* 2/27/2015Hey guys it has been 6 months since the purchase and everything is still going well. The only thing that I can complain about is that my son gets his feet and legs hung in between the spokes of the side rails. This is of course something that can't really be avoided if you don't have some bumpers or something. And it usually only happens when he is playing and rolling around not when he sleeps. Hope this was helpful.",

                "reviewText": "This crib gets pretty constant excellent ratings for safety. That's why I bought it. All of the reviews place this crib at, or near the top with respect to safety. So I won't really touch on that. What I will say is that it looks great, it's really easy to put together and allows the kid to grow into this as a real bed. Since it isn't too frilly and crib like one the head and foot, I can see this becoming a really decent twin bed when she gets older.Shipping was pretty good. The box was banged up a bit on arrival, but the crib itself was undamaged. No dents, dings, or scratches on the wood.Build was relatively easy compared to the dresser/changing table, but as others have remarked the instructions are nothing to write home about. The good news is that there are really only a handful of pieces and they make logical sense. Total build time for this was around 1 hour with one person. I can't speak to durability yet, since the kid isn't born but it appears to be well built. The grey looks to be solidly painted on, so maybe some of the quality issues others have remarked on have been repaired. I wasn't gentle with it while putting it together and still have no dents or scrapes. I'm sure a little kid can find a way though. All in all I have a really positive impression of this crib. Would definitely buy again if I had to.",

                "reviewText": "We got this crib for our first child due in November. So far I could not be happier.- It is beautiful: The color is exactly the same as it is in the pictures and has very nice detailing. Simply gorgeous!- Very sturdy: We looked at cribs similar in price at many different stores, as well as cribs much more expensive. We decided on this crib because of the positive reviews and the fact that it was made of solid, sustainably harvested wood. Dollar for dollar, it is on par with cribs we were looking at that were double the price.- Great value: As I said, we were prepared to pay nearly $400 for a crib since all of the ones we looked at for less looked and felt so cheaply made. This crib truly seems like it is sturdy enough to withstand the test of time. Also, this particular bed came with the Toddler Rail included, which can/will save you nearly $100 when your little one out grows his or her baby bed.- Longevity: Besides the fact that you could use this as a baby crib, toddler bed, day bed and full-size bed, it also has 4 adjustable settings for the height of the crib mattress. This is very convenient for those of us with short little t-rex arms like me.- Easy to put together: From opening the box to completely assembled, it took my husband about an hour and a half to complete. In comparison to our changing table, putting the crib together was a breeze. The instructions were clear and there were no missing or misaligned holes. He did use a power drill to help screw things in faster, which was a huge help, but not necessary.One thing that we didn't account for: we didn't measure the hallway or nursery door when we spread out all the parts and built it in the living room. After the fact we realized that it wouldn't fit. So to get it in baby's room we'll have to take it 100% apart and put it back together again. Thankfully, that won't be so terribly painful.Highly recommended!",
