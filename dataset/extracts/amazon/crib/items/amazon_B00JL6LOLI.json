                "reviewText": "A little backstory: my husband and I had wanted to plan on doing a Montessori floor bed for our son when he was ready to transition to his own room, but realized that, for us, this may not happen for quite some time (and by that point we may just go straight to toddler bed). Our 11 week old son had recently outgrown his smaller bassinet, and in this transition has been sleeping in the bassinet insert in a pack n play in our room- but now that he is more active and wiggling and kicking all the time, the pack n play bassinet just does not feel stable (plus the \u201cmattress\u201d is really just more of a board which I can\u2019t imagine would be comfy for sleeping).Just received the crib yesterday, and my husband set it up last night in our bedroom (our son will sleep in our room until at least 6 months, if not longer). As far as I know, it was relatively easy and straightforward to set up, although the longer front and back pieces weren\u2019t labeled up from down so my husband just had to flip it around at one point to get all the edges along the top flush.Obviously have not had this crib long enough to comment on durability, but it feels extremely stable (which was my main worry when ordering a crib that was under $100). It does not wiggle at all, and all of the joints are completely tight together. I was worried about the hardware not being hidden like some of the more expensive crib models, but the ebony color we ordered came with dark charcoal/black hardware so it barely shows at all. Not sure that would have been the case with the hardware that comes with the other color options.We have the Newton Baby crib mattress (also highly recommend!) and it fits so perfectly in this crib- so snug down in the frame there\u2019s not even a hair of space between the mattress and the slats.I didn\u2019t really check the height of the crib before ordering, so was a little surprised with how low it seems overall- but I actually prefer that, since our son\u2019s nursery is pretty small I think it will feel more size-appropriate for the space once we move it in there.Will update in the future if this changes, but so far, very happy we took the chance on this very affordable, cute little crib!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my son who is 7 months old now.It's a great product, holds up well and does as it's intended. Easy to assemble. Strong quality bolts etc.I think the only thing I was bummed about is it doesn't include the bed guard attachment for when you transition baby to a toddler bed. You have to buy that separately and they are not always in stock.Other cribs I've bought over the years always had that piece included.It's a small inconvenience and not the end of the world. The piece costs about $30 USD if I remember correctly.Something to keep in mind if you are wanting a crib with this attachment piece already.I will say it is a beautiful crib though. I like the color we bought, ours is gray. Fits a typical crib mattress very well without leaving little gaps as some cribs from othet makers can do.",

                "reviewText": "Love it. Wasn\u2019t terribly hard to put together. It\u2019s lightweight, so it\u2019s easy to move around. It does chip easily but that doesn\u2019t matter to me. You get what you pay for so pick and choose what matters to you. Originally purchased a mini crib and realized I was in need of a standard size crib and this was not only affordable but fits perfectly in my nursery and baby seems to love already. Especially with the graco mattress I ordered to go with it. Would purchase again. Recommend!",

I agree with some of the other reviews that the crib is slightly splintery. I did get 2 splinters while assembling, but that is the quality you get for the price. It seems pretty sturdy after assembly. I think it looks nice, clean, and simple. 4 different mattress heights to choose from. Again, you get what you pay for.",

                "reviewText": "My husband and I are thrilled about this crib. Our 8month old recently grew out of his bedside bassinet and we searched long and hard for a crib we felt comfortable moving forward with. Took a chance on this one after reading other reviews, and we\u2019re glad we did. It\u2019s sturdy and well-made. And we love the different configurations we can choose from as baby boy grows (I do wish it came with additional instructions for each option beyond the traditional crib). Assembly was relatively simple (though my husband did 99% of the work). We\u2019re also very happy with the color!",

                "reviewText": "Update: 4/28/20 our daughter is going to be 3 in June and still happily sleeps in this crib (and she\u2019s a solid kid, wears a size 3/4T already and over 35 lbs). It\u2019s still as solid as it was the day we first put it together. Great buy! Updating review to 5 starsOriginal: We bought this crib for our 3rd daughter (after giving away the one we used for our other daughters). I wasn't looking for anything super high quality, as I am certain this will be our last child, and for $117 I don't think it's a bad buy by any means. But I'm not sure how well this will hold up to the wear/tear of a toddler when it's converted to a toddler bed knowing how my others daughter used to push on the sides of the cribs/climb all over it, etc. But I do think it'll do it's job as a crib for a small baby.One thing I wasn't quite expecting was how short the crib is. My 5 year old daughter is tall enough to see into the crib w/o having to look through the crib slats. This doesn't bother me though as I'm excited for my girls to be able to stare lovingly at their new baby sister :), but I wonder too how this will work to keep a baby in their crib when they are taller, standing and climbing around. Our previous crib was a DaVinci model that our daughters were never able to (or at least never tried to) climb out of, and they stayed in it as a crib for 2 years, then another year or so as a toddler bed.Bottom line: if you are looking for something smaller (probably same size as an Ikea crib), simple looking and not needing a crib that will last through more than one child this is a good buy.",
