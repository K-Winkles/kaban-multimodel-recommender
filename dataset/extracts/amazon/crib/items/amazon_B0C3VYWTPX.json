You can keep an eye on babies breathing, heave them nearby for nappy changes and even take the side down and hold their hand while you sleep.As someone who doesn't have an issue with co-sleeping, I still think these are beneficial for the first few months after birth as baby is at their most fragile and susceptible then and having their own enclosure close beside you is a great idea.The quality of the Allta crib is excellent, it's easy to adjust and I like the colour and style of the fabric. The crib itself feels comfortable with an included mattress and overall it's great value for money.",
