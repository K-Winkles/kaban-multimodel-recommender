We counted all our pieces before starting, and after that it only took my husband a little over an hour? to set up! It looks adorable and I actually don't feel that it's \"tiny\". It works for the purpose we intended. Foam mattress/pad for crib and changing table are of course cheap and flimsy, but what do you expect!",

                "reviewText": "This crib is great for small spaces. Assembly was fairly easy although some of the instructions did not make sense. We were able to figure assembly out and the crib is sturdy. The appearance is pretty nice but the railings don\u2019t exactly match for the natural colored crib, they stand out a bit but not awful. The railings appear to be made of a more cheap material, not solid wood. We knew this is in fact a mini crib but be aware the sleeping space is small. Hopefully it works until baby is ready to transition to a bed. The changing pad is not a standard size, reviews stated many people had trouble finding an adequate cover. I recommend the brand Pobi Baby. While the Pobi Baby changing cover is not a perfect snug fit, it works well enough.",

                "reviewText": "This crib came with 9 very damaged pieces (scuffs, dents, writing on exposed areas of the wood, stripped stain). Per the instructions, I contacted the company for replacement parts and provided photos of the damaged pieces (more than what I have inclided in the review). I was advised they will only issue a maximum of 2 replacement parts and that replacement parts for this crib are hard to come by due to low inventory. I was advised to return and request a replacement from Amazon. I had already had one replacement prior to this due to the carrier at UPS leaving the crib out in the pouring rain (despite having a covered porch it could have been left on). I advised the company I would be returning the crib and purchasing another brand. The crib itself seemed on the cheapy side, but for the size and price I would have made it work if they were more accommodating. I liked the built in drawers, its unfortunate this model was so poorly made. Trying to stuff that crib back in the box was no easy task for the return either. Buying this crib was one big hassel. I will never buy this brand again.",

It's so cute and I love the way it's put together.***UPDATE*** 3 years, taking this down, moving it, putting it back together without instructions for baby #3, and it's still great. The only issue I've had was the tiny screws that hold the draw track on the side of the drawers like to come loose. I put some longer ones in to replace those, and have had no more issues. Would defnitely recommend.",
