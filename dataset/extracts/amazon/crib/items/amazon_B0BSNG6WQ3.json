I was also 30wks pregnant when putting it together so that definitely could\u2019ve added to the difficulty. Color is exactly as shown. I have the dresser that matches with it. It has 3 or 4 different height levels that you can put the mattress at as the baby grows. The highest level is a little lower than I was expecting and I think a little lower than other cribs may have it, but that\u2019s not a big deal for me.",

Another thing to consider is that the arrangement of the changing table is always to the right, there is no possibility of switching sides which is a boomer since this is a grow with your baby kind of furniture. Also, if you don't fit the drawers correctly they\u2019ll look crooked. We had already opened and we thought the return would be a hustle because of the size of the box so we didn\u2019t do so. At the end of the day the crib does the job, but we are not a 100% happy since we bought it because of the drawers it had but didn\u2019t expect them to be that small\u2026",

My problem is I won't feel comfortable moving forward with putting my child in there untill I look over it with magnifying glass. I say this because I myself took a nasty splinter from on of the slats that close off the walls of the crib. The same slats that your child with be holding onto to pull themselves up and down. The splitter I received was not only painful but made me bleed. On further inspection after assembling I found multiple slats splintering. Ontop of this the draw under the crib doesn't open and shut properly without getting hung up.",
