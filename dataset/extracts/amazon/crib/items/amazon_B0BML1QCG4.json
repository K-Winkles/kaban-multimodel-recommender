                "reviewText": "We purchased this for our little dog since she is partially paralyzed and needs a safe space. The drs said we should put her down, but our little girl was so alert and happy, and we felt the drs were wrong. We bought this pack and play for her so she could move around and be herself for as long as she has left. This is a sturdy \"play pen\" and she can see us and the other dogs through the mesh sides. The pad is very nice and well-padded. We use bed pads (for wetting) and she is also in diapers. So, just like a baby, we can keep tabs on her. The bassinette, the upper position, is very nice. But since our little dog likes to sit up to see us and then falls over, we keep her in the bottom \"play pen\" so she will be safe. I just wish this had an adjustable place so the play pen area could be placed in a higher position to save the bending to care for her.",
