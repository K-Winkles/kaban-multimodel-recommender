                "reviewText": "I liked this crib because it was a cheaper version of a Crate and Kids Crib. The. Lack was cute and rounded tops are unique. I don\u2019t think the paint seems super durable. So far it is fine, I don\u2019t have a crib biter but I\u2019m worried when we move it the paint will easily chip. Still cute and a great price.",
