This mobile fits this crib perfectly!)10 outta 10 would recommend!!The animals on it are a fox, a raccoon, a bear and deer I believe! And has stars on the ring part! So cute!

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars An Excellent, Safer Option",
                "reviewText": "We just put this Breathable Baby bumper on our crib (the gray chevron print with navy blue trim), though baby-to-be won't actually be here for another couple of months.It does look exactly as it does in the Amazon-provided photos. HOWEVER, one thing that is not super obvious in the pictures, is that the chevron print is ONLY on the inside of the crib bumper; the side facing out is solid gray. I was a teeny bit disappointed in this, although it's not a 'deal breaker' because I understand this is more of a safety item, and won't be used for very long either. I did think it was worth noting in my review though!The bumper comes in two solid pieces, and if you look carefully at the pictures, you can see that it stays put with velcro tabs, by sort of threading through slats and then folding back and sticking to itself. It seemed a bit confusing at first, but the instructions that come in the package are excellent, and provide clear diagrams for various types of cribs - solid back, solid sides, and slats all the way aroun (we have slats on all sides). The breathable mesh fabric does definitely seem like it is truly breathable, and a much safer option for once your child starts to roll - if they were to roll over and get tangled up in the bumper at all, I'd greatly prefer this one over a traditional bumper, and not having one at all makes me a little nervous with the slats.While we do like and recommend this bumper, the one downfall is the way this bumper threads through the corner posts. There is a small pocket created at each corner, because it doesn't fold flush around them (there is no way for it to); instead, it creates a triangle, with the bumper at a diagonal in front of the corner posts, and the 'L' of the posts behind it. From what I understand, most children who begin to roll and explore their crib are generally going to the front or back sides, not the corners. But if our kiddo does ever find his way to that corner, I'll be concerned that he can somehow get tangled up underneath/behind there, and because of this, as SOON as he can sit up or pull himself up even slightly, the bumper will come off.Overall, we think this is the safest bumper option available if you're going to go with one, and we also think it appears well-made and attractive, so we recommend it. We'll have to see how it holds up once baby is here, so I will come back and review this in several months.",

Keeps baby's limbs inside.-Breathable-Design is cute.Dislikes:-Wasn't easy to put in.-Not see through- Baby has gotten a leg stuck between it and the crib once-Moves every time the crib gate is raised or lowered so the whole thing has to be adjusted each time I put baby in crib to sleep.- Will be a pain to remove and reinstall when it needs to be washed-The ties. Either they're tied to tight to better help keep item in place or your can make them looser for easier removal, but you'll have to retire them often.-Baby wants to pull on the ties, Velcro, and sides.In summary, it was worth purchasing because I have better peace of mind leaving her unattended overnight to sleep, but it could be better and cheaper.",

                "reviewText": "We couldn\u2019t be happier with this liner. We didn\u2019t transition our daughter to her crib from her halo bassinest until after 6 months. Once we did, she seemed to get a hand or foot between the slats often. Our nursery has gray walls, a white crib, and pink accents so I ordered this hoping for a pleasant match. Sometimes the colors in these online products can be off putting when you see it in person. Not the case here! It is a perfect match. The gray is a beautiful true gray, the pink is soft and beautiful, and the white is perfect. This also isn\u2019t an old school bumper that you just tie off to the slats. It\u2019s a two piece bumper. You place the longer piece against the back of the crib and follow the directions to thread through in certain places then secure with very strong Velcro and finish off with ties. The second piece is shorter and goes along the front in a similar fashion. It leaves no gaps and my little one hasn\u2019t had any more slips between the slats. I was a little intimidated when I originally removed it from the package because their were no directions included but the company directs you to their website where there is a great video tutorial (which is a big plus for mommy brain!). I\u2019ve washed the liner once and it held up great. We use it with the Graco Rory convertible crib and it\u2019s a perfect fit. I don\u2019t worry that my daughter will step on the liner and use it as leverage to step out of the crib. The liner slides down from the top if she tries to step on it but it still maintains a barrier from allowing her feet and hands to slide out. She likes to pull it down a little bit to peak out when she should be sleeping! She also loves the animals printed around bumper. They are beautiful and friendly looking and she loves laying in bed and cooing to the animals! If you found this review helpful, please click the helpful button \ud83d\ude09",
