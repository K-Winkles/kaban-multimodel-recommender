I love the color and texture of the material as well as the scalloped edge design. Fits in our nursery well. It was extremely easy to put together too, very self explanatory and came with all the bolts needed! It it is a positive that it is pre-drilled to become a day bed and toddler bed, however, it does not include the necessary parts to upgrade it. They are sold separately and therefore isn't technically a 3 in 1 as advertised. Also requires a 10mm wrench to install the wheels but is not included. That's not a huge issue though as most people would have that at home already. Overall I am satisfied with the product!",

                "reviewText": "I think this is the most amazing crib for the price. It\u2019s definitely easier as a 2 man job but could be done with one person. It took us about 45 minutes to set it up but I am thoroughly impressed. It is sturdy and the wheels make the crib so much easier to deal with. Id literally buy this for every child I was having (if I wasn\u2019t so cheap and planned on reusing this one haha).",
