I leaned on the bed to rub my daughters back as she fell asleep and cracked one of the boards. I barely put weight on it as I was sitting on the floor. So don't do that and you'll be fine lol. She initially fell out of this bed twice and then maybe 2 more times in the few months that we had it. So we made sure to put pillows down near the entrance. She very much enjoys this bed though.",

                "reviewText": "My nephew was visiting with his 2-year old, who was still a little young to be sleeping outside a crib. But I wanted a bed that could \u201cgrow\u201d with the 2-year old when he comes to visit a year from now, so I did not want a crib. But I also did not want an open toddler bed that he could roll out of before he is ready. The bed, with an opening on just one side, was perfect. This year, when he is 2, I could just put the open side next to the wall, so it was like having a crib (no openings). The next year when they return, I can just turn the crib around and have the opening on the outside, letting him crawl out after he wakes up.It worked super well this year for him as a 2-year old. Looking forward to turning the bed around for the \u201cbig boy\u201d that he will be next year when he turns 3. \ud83e\udd17",

Daughter went straight to it and immediately was in love with it. Fits her nicely and is light enough to be easily maneuvered and repositioned throughout the room. There\u2019s enough room under to allow for good airflow and convenient cat storage.",
