                "reviewText": "This won't be a crib that gets handed down for generations and it won't like stand up to much abuse. That said...it was reasonably priced, it looks nice, and it's sturdy. It took an hour or so for my daughter and I to assemble it. The instructions are secured in an envelope that is attached to the metal bottom frame piece. Only one tool is required for assembly and it's included. It's very lightweight and all parts are stationary (the side rail does not adjust). You are able to raise/lower the position of the mattress by adjusting the position of the metal bottom frame. This isn't really convenient or simple to do, once assembled. So I just set it at the lowest position to start out, so that I never need to adjust.",
