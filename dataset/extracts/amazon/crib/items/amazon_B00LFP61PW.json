                "reviewText": "This crib was very straightforward with its directions as long as you pay attention to detail. Including the pictures, as they will show you sticker details on the pieces to determine which direction to face them etc. the only struggle we had was putting the base inside for the mattress, it was very hard to pull the crib tight enough to fit in all the holes, but with my experience in the past it seems to be just a crib thing, not necessarily this crib only. It\u2019s extremely sturdy and not heavy to move either. I love the table and drawer feature on it, allows us to have more with limited wall space in a small room. Also the dividers between drawers and under the changing table were a little tricky to set in place while assembled, but not impossible. Need 2 people at least.",

                "reviewText": "After reading the other reviews I was hesitant about this crib but it\u2019s great! The shipping was fast and it came in perfect condition. The box was a little beat up with some holes but it\u2019s VERY heavy so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard for the delivery drivers who are alone to move it. The crib pieces were protected enough that there was no damage to any of the paint or pieces.Assembly:The instructions were pretty clear and easy to follow. It took my husband and I a few hours to put together. I would rate the difficulty 3/5, you may yell at the crib but it won\u2019t ruin your marriage lol. The harder part was the changing table and aligning the divider boards. Everything lined up great for us! A lot of the pieces look almost identical but they have subtle differences so you have to pay attention to the numbers, I am assuming that\u2019s why a lot of the reviews say it doesn\u2019t line up. My husbands only issue was the way they package the hardware makes it hard to keep it organized since all the screws look very similar and they move all about when trying to get others out.Size:I was worried from the reviews about the changing table being small but it\u2019s a very normal size if not big. I am not worried about my baby not fitting on it even into toddler years. The top mattress height seems a little low to me but this is my first baby so my perceptions may be off, and it\u2019s not astronomically low anyway.Overall we are very happy with this crib it looks great and works great! All the drawers fit perfect and open/close with no issue. I would recommend this crib especially for the price!",

The drawers, shelves and changing table are so convenient and smart. I would have given 5 stars however when my partner and I were building it one of the wood supports for the drawers shattered. Customer service was slightly difficult to get ahold of and it took us awhile to get a replacement. However they eventually did get back to us and were helpful. Everything worked out! The drawers don\u2019t perfectly align but that\u2019s only really aesthetic issue if anything. They still open and close just fine. I am content with my purchase and the crib looks lovely in our nursery. Our little girl will love it and I\u2019m excited that it can potentially be used for years!",
