                "reviewText": "So\u2026great crib, low to the ground so it was easy to reach over (with me being 5\u20195) BUT had the most difficulties getting it delivered. I guess USPS is who they use for delivery and USPS left a message for me saying they couldn\u2019t deliver the crib because \u201cmailbox was full.\u201d \u2026 like a crib would fit in a mailbox. Well, went to my local post office and it wasn\u2019t there so I had to go to the city over to pick it up. This had become very annoying because I had someone coming to set the crib up when it was due to be delivered and it never came. my work schedule is also crazy so by the time I could go get it, I then discovered it wouldn\u2019t fit in my car -.- luckily a postal worker helped me maneuver my back seat/passengers seat and remove my car seats to get it in. I drive a larger Nissan Altima. Luckily the kids weren\u2019t with me. So with that being said, great crib, hassle to get. BUT I reached out to Amazon and they did work with me to correct this mistake. It took a little persistence, but it was corrected. If you have to pick it up, take a SUV or truck. It\u2019s not heavy, just long and thin. Easy to put together as well. Color is cute and modern.",
