Similar looking cribs cost twice as much. I was able to assemble it within a half hour without any problems. The screws line up with the holes nicely, the crib itself has no defects, and it's a great height. One of my biggest issues with other cribs is that so many had their screws and holes visible. This crib has very minimal hardware showing. I hope my review is the reassurance you need.",

                "reviewText": "We love the crib, but it arrived with a huge blemish/dent on the side. Since our child will be here shortly, we didn't have the time to return it and wait for another one to arrive. So we assembled it and turned the part that was damaged toward the wall. We were extremely disappointed that the product arrived damaged - and there were no issues (tears, holes) in the packaging it was shipped in, so it appears it was shipped from the manufacturer in that condition.",
