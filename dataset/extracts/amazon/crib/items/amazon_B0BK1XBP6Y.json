It also converts to a toddler bed so I\u2019ll be ordering the toddler rail to go with it soon. It looks really high end at an affordable price.",

                "reviewText": "To pick a crib, I did a complete search in Amazon with both jpma and greenguard gold labels, and then went thru all comments and eliminated ones contains smell issues in reviews. Strangely an unexpected pattern is showed up: typically cribs from China has a likelihood of smell issues. I did have my favorites among them and one of them was this BabyGap model. So nearly I was gonna eliminate this due to origin however due to current discount decided to go for it and pleasantly surprised that smell is very low as expected from a new furniture and went away in couple of days. Very easy to install and we love it.",

I purchased the set in July and it\u2019s now November and it hasn\u2019t gotten better. I missed the return window and I don\u2019t know what to do. Please help!",
