The crib was wobbling and I looked and it was snapped off around the screw. I called the seller but it\u2019s out of warranty and called the manufacturer and a new leg will be $60 and it\u2019s back ordered for a few months! Hate spending money on something that breaks and can\u2019t be fixed. Especially my child\u2019s crib. Also heard that someone else had called for the same thing earlier this week. Common issue?",

I would have returned, but noone wants to go through the hassle of returning large items. So i kept it and it was easy to assemble. I used vinegar to scrub off the rust and I would say it got about 90% of the rust off. Haven\u2019t used it yet, but it looks really nice in the nursery.",

Very easy to put together, 30 minutes tops. There is TINY little chip where the powder coat is missing where two metal bars meet, but not at all something to fuss about. If you don\u2019t want to pay 500-600 dollars for a trendy gold crib GET THIS!!! ITS BEAUTIFUL! I will be putting a Newton mattress in here & the measurements are great!!!",
