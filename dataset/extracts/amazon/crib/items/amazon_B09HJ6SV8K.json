                "reviewText": "We love this playpen!! We lived in our bedroom for the first three months because I honestly had everything I needed in there, including a twin bassinet (not this playpen). Now that we\u2019ve ventured downstairs, this is PERFECT! The bassinets are so easy to pull in and out of the playpen and everything feels so sturdy. My boys are now a little too big for the bassinets so they are out but the shelf they rested on is beyond amazing for the babies to be high enough to see out and for me to reach down and take care of them without breaking my back (read: twin pregnancy WRECKED this back and the constant changing weight of my chest with milk production doesn\u2019t help!). The Twin Z pillow sits perfectly on that shelf and this is our one stop shop for tandem bottles, nap time, and safe space while mama gets chores done. Babies fussy? The shelf does move with the slightest movement so swaying and hip checking the side will get the playpen swaying with me and the babies are instantly soothed. The diaper changing tray is also amazing but a little low for my comfort so I have a changing station on a higher counter to help my back. There are wheels on one side of the playpen so we wheel it room to room if needed (without the babies inside). I highly recommend!!

The 2 individual bassinet rockers are super cool to me. They attach to the play pen, you can detach them and use them anywhere, and when i dont need it i can take it apart and store it under the playpen or bed. It also comes with 2 little music boxes, with 3 options of different sounds, volume options, and nightlight. Big fan of the nursery center, I use it the most. Theres also a holder for diapers and other things which I find super useful to keep everything in one place. This product is a dream for anyone expecting twins with the best pricing. I would definitely recommend this product.",

However, instructions for assembly were not clear, I had to go on youtube and watch an assembly video.I will update once my twins have arrived and it's been used.Update Aug 9 2022My babies were preemies and required adjustments on their sleeping and nap settings so we couldn't use the bassinets that came with the playard.They started taking naps in the playard when they're 3months old which was perfect fit for them (both)Fast forward, being 6 months old they're rolling over all the time so we can't use the changing table anymore (feels kinda unstable even when strapped to the playard) and in general the playard size works for 1 baby at a time, not both inside.I had to arrange a napping and playing area in the living room, so I'll be using the playard for storage or travelling.I don't regret buying this product I just wish the playard was a bit larger to really fit both babies inside (napping, playtime, etc).",

                "reviewText": "This is definitely a must have for twins! So for it has worked great for us for the last 2 months with our twins. I keep it right by my bed and the bassinets work perfect. Super easy to put together and quick to close up if you want to move it from room to room. Bassinets pop out easily so you can carry the babies to different rooms for naps if needed, something we did when they were brand new :)The reason for 4 stars is the inside mat on the bassinets does not remove to wash. It has gotten quite dirty from spit up over the last few months and there is no way to take it out and wash it. I read another review that said theirs veclcros in? That is not that case with mine. Other than that this has worked out perfect for our needs so far.",

So they will grow out soon. The pac n play is great. They can still sleep on the top part for a while and then expand to stand in the bottom later. The changing table is nice and all parts secure. You just have to remove one of the cradle beds is you want the changing table on top. Everything is convenient at hands length. Great for when they come to stay I don't have to have a lot of baby furniture. That's for their home. The price was not bad. And it all can break down and go into a carrier bag. When grandchildren grow up I'll pass on to someone else. Little wear and tear when taken care of.",
