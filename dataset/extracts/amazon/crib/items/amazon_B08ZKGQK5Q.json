We just leave it up all the time, but it's easy to fold away. The changing table is hard to snap on, but I don't want it to fall off - so that's okay. Eventually, when we make it into a play pen that piece will be removed. We will just leave the changing table attached until he can roll over or starts pulling up. I left the instruction paper on the playpen floor so you can see the bottom level. Great price!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for our 4th baby since our old one has seen better days. Right now she's 8wks old and I've basically been using it as more of a changing station in our bedroom since she sleeps with me, has a crib in her big sister's room, and a cradle in her nursery.So currently it's sitting in the corner with all attachments on it, and I keep her diapers, wipes, clothes, bows, towels, blankets etc inside.I don't have any complaints with this one. It was easy to put together, it comes apart and breaks down easily, it rolls perfectly (our old one never rolled right), and on top of that it has a cute pattern around the top that's not overly childish amd annoying to look at every day.The price is great too. I mean this is the price you'll typically pay for a playpen with zero attachments. Other models we looked at that were similar to this one were $150+",
