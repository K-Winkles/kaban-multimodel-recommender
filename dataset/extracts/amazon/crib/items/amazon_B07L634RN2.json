I read mixed reviews on the crib but decided to purchase anyway.We received the crib with multiple chips/scratches and one of the darker wood pieces had a deformity/discoloration on the top of it. We contacted Storkcraft directly with pictures of the pieces and they offered us a paint pen and sanding tool stating the issues with the crib didn\u2019t warrant any further action. We chose to return the crib. If I\u2019m spending $300+ on a crib, I expect it to be in pretty good shape.We ended up buying a babyletto crib instead which came with a damaged piece. Babyletto fixed the issue immediately. Customer service matters.",

I blame the unclear instructions:)This is a great product and I would recommend it!!!",

I also went to Westcoastkid, a local store to check out the quality. This crib is firm and well-designed - a lot better than the crib in Ikea with similar price. However, when I open the box to assemble the crib, the crib release toxic odour which makes me can't stand with it at all! I am wondering if this product passed the baby product safe standard. How can a baby product come with a toxic smell!!! Also, the delivery is so slow!! It takes me a long long time (more than half a month) to receive this product - after my baby was born. My baby does not have a place to sleep because it comes too late! If you are in a rush, please do not order this crib! Not recommended!!",
