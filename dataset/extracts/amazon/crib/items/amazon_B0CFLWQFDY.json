                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Twins Bassinet for Baby for my daughter-in-law, who is expecting twins. Ordering online without seeing it in person made me a bit apprehensive, but the quick delivery right to the door eased those worries, sparing us from the hassle of lugging around a heavy box. The bassinet itself is quite impressive, featuring a handy storage area for essentials. We opted for the pink version due to the first-choice color being sold out, and I must say, it's a lovely shade of pink \u2013 not gaudy at all. My son managed to put it together without encountering any major issues. The bassinet offers plenty of space for two babies, and the included separator is a practical addition. Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase",

The assembly is also very simple. First, install the two fixed brackets on both sides of the crib. , and then install the storage basket at the bottom. The height of the bed can be adjusted. It also comes with a small bed for baby changing diapers and a mosquito-proof cover. The small bed is pink and tender. , just suitable for my sister, the bed is movable, and it is convenient for me to take her to other houses to do anything.",

After a few nights it leveled out really nicely and now it\u2019s completely level! To be fair it was only off by a degreee or two in some spots but still lol as a first time mom I have all the worries. I would highly recommend this bassinet.
