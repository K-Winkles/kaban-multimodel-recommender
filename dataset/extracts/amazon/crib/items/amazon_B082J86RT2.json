All of the reviews that talk about it being hard to snap into place- this is only true if you leave the top cover attached while trying to snap it. If you unhook the cover it pops right into place and then you replace the cover. It\u2019s narrower than a regular pack and play, which makes it great for smaller travel spaces. We took it camping and used it in the bunk room of an RV!The only thing I don\u2019t like is that there are no specific sheets- I padded it with a blanket and used a regular crib sheet but it was still oversized and I would not have felt comfortable using it with an infant or any baby that would be at risk of suffocating.",

                "reviewText": "As a mom of two-under-two, I am thrilled with the Baby Delight Go With Me Portable Crib and Play yard. I highly recommend for anyone who is looking for a portable crib as this is something you could use for years.Why I love it:-First off, the design and color! I love the look of the charcoal tweed compared to other play yards out there.-It's so versatile - I could have my 20 month old playing in it outside as a play yard or I can use it inside for my 3 month old to take a nap.-I love the zipper feature - my 20 month old uses this as his portable crib when he sleeps at my parents and it's now such a comfort to him. When he goes into his room at night, he automatically crawls in through the zipper part and knows it's time for bed. It's so cute! This is a key feature for caregivers who may not be able to bend over to lift a heavy toddler in and out of a pack and play.-Love the travel bag and how easy it is to collapse.There are so many portable cribs on the market and hands down, this is the best. You will not be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "Going from the bed side bassinet to a pack n play. I bought this item with no reviews to go off of. hoping that it was just as amazing as their bassinet. We are trying to stay minimal until we get moved into our home. So I\u2019ve been using my sister standard graco pack n play from time to time, but it\u2019s absolutely horrid having to put up and take down. IT SHOULD NOT TAKE THAT MUCH MAN POWER! I personally like the floor level bed and the ability my daughter has to just craw in or out to during her exploration (of course I have to open/close it). This bed is super simple, light, durable, and cozy! It\u2019s a win all around for us.",

                "reviewText": "Have owned a number of small/ultra portable cribs and so far this model is among the best. It's super lightweight so it's easy to get in and out of the closet and setup when my grandson visits. After setting it up once, it's very intuitive how the parts snap into place and it takes less than a minute to get setup. The dimensions are pretty in line with other lightweight cribs. Bear in mind this isn't mean to compete with a full-sized complete playyard with changing table and bassinet and everything. It's great as a temporary/few days setup that's safe and easy to put up and down.",
