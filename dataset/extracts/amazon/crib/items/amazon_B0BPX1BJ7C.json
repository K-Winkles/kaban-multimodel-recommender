The assembly seemed pretty simple to me and it is so easy to put away and store it in a car for a road trip. It doesn\u2019t take up a lot of space, and the mat that comes with it was surprisingly thick and softer than other mats I\u2019ve felt. Honestly was worth the money and I\u2019m happy that it turns into like a play pen if we need it. This is an amazing product if you are travelers like we are with an infant and/or toddlers like us!",

We checked it at the airport with no issues and it is reallly easy to set up and use. It\u2019s super compact and makes carrying easier than a traditional pack n play. Our son loved it so much and slept so well that when we got home I switched it out for his bassinet. I love the versatility from a high sleeping situation to once old enough you can put them on the ground to sleep or even to play. Was looking at getting the guava one and this one was half the price and really great. Good material and easy to use.",

This works for younger and not standing babies. I loved the newborn attachment and wanted it for next baby. But seeing how it fell over just by leaning on it. I just couldn't keep it. It packs really well and assembles easily.",
