Sturdy and gives you multiple options for mattress height so if you're short like me it isn't a problem to bend over! Love this item, very excited to use it! Also super light and sooo easy to move around to find the best spot!",

I'm a little disappointed that the rail doesn't slide down to pick up baby at a more comfortable height. The bending over and setting baby down when asleep is fairly awkward. It seems to be really sturdy after it's built. The wood itself seems a little fragile if you push down on it to hard. ( I put my hand on the slats while it was in the first phase. The wood seems like it's just pressed ply wood.) It has a pretty paint job and it was delivered in excellent condition. All and all I'm satisfied for what I paid.",
