A large bassinet sheet can easily fit on the matress for extra comfort... The frame is extremely sturdy and supportive. It was very easy to assemble the four 'leg\" caps on each corner. I love that you can make it rock back and forth but also use it standing still without any motion. It is not quite as tall as I would like (I'm 5'10\"), but it fits perfectly beside the bed for easy access. This also comes with an attachable mosquito netting which is super cool; but not sure I would want this for outside use!!?? Over all it is very nice \ud83d\ude0a",

                "reviewText": "A great little bassinet compared to others out there. I wanted a collapsible bassinet for space saving when not in use and this is perfect. It\u2019s nice and big and holds way more weight than other bassinets so I will be able to use it longer. Love that it comes with the netting. I can use it outdoors if I want and no bugs can mess with the baby. The material is nice and I like the placement of the mesh. I can see right through and watch the baby sleep. There were a few things that I didn\u2019t care for. The mattress has an imprint from where the baby\u2019s head lays now after a month of use. It doesn\u2019t bother him but just weird to me it would do that. With a sheet on the mattress the strap you pull to fold it down is covered causing me to have to pull the strap from underneath. When you have it folded the legs automatically slide in so you have to make sure you pop them both back out when folding back out. Also the parts you attach to make the bassinet rock are inconvenient. They don\u2019t really stay on and you have to take them off to keep the bassinet from rocking. They don\u2019t just lock to keep it in place. Which you cannot really take them off with the baby in it so we just don\u2019t use them at all. Despite all the downfalls I do still really like this bassinet. The size and height outweigh the bad for me because I couldn\u2019t find another bassinet comparable.",
