The lower floor can also be used to store the baby's daily necessities. There is also a changing table that is very practical. The baby is about to be born. I think I am so satisfied with this crib.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Mattress is a lot harder than a standard packnplay/ smell",
                "reviewText": "When I opened the box there was a smell like the packnplay had been sitting in a warehouse for a while. The frame of the packnplay aired out nicely after a day or two but the mattress still smells really bad. I even sprayed it with an antimicrobial fabric spray and it's gotten better but is still there. It kindof smells like old celery. The mattress that came with it is very hard. The separation between the slats of whatever makes the backing of the play mat are very large and makes them move a lot because they aren't stitched into place they're just kind of loose in a pocket of stitched material. The frame of the packnplay is very sturdy and the side that slides down is very easy to slide and clips into place perfectly. I haven't used it as a a bedside but I'm very short and was concerned that I wouldn't be able to lay my son down in a packnplay gently while he's sleeping but the side that slides down really helps me put him on the bottom level without worrying about dropping him. The zippers are well made. It's longer than the average packnplay so if you order a mattress for it like I did you'll need one that is 24\" x 38\" long. Not seam to seam. All in all it's a very safe packnplay on both the top and bottom level. I really love that I don't have to worry about my baby.",
