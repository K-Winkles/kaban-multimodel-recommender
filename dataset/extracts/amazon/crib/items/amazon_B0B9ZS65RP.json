                "reviewText": "There are so many cribs out there, some costing way more than they should. This crib was perfect. It\u2019s adorable, unique, and fit in our budget. Best of all, it\u2019s sturdy and safe. Our newborn has already taken naps in it and sleeps well there. I love that you can change the height of the mattress as baby grows and that it can convert to a toddler bed etc. Only thing I would note is I wish the mattress base was white to match the white of the crib but instead it\u2019s black. Not super noticeable just would\u2019ve preferred it to be white. Other than that, great purchase!",

                "reviewText": "This crib is beautiful and perfect size, fast and easy to assemble, yet our crib came damaged with two holes on one of the sides and they told us we\u2019d have to repackage it and bring it to a ups store and wait for a refund to get a new one. We didn\u2019t like that idea as we needed it now and don\u2019t have the time/space in vehicle to lug it all the way to UPS. Luckily the holes were facing the outside so we just put that side on the wall, I guess you get what you pay for. Still looks good and is sturdy.",
