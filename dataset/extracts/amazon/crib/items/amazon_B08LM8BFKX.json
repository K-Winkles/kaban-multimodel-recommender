                "reviewText": "This crib is the perfect size to put in our small room. Its the same size as a pack n play so we are able to move it around and adjust it as needed. It only took me about 20 minutes to put together by myself and has held up very well, but the paint is starting to chip minorly after just 7 months of use.",

                "reviewText": "I never write reviews. But boy do I feel strongly about this purchase. Do not buy this crib! I purchased it for our foster children, anticipating a cute, modern crib that would last me a few placements. This crib broke within a month of one baby using it. And the baby is not even pulling up or super active. One of the legs completely broke off and is so stripped, there is no fixing it securely. The leg broke when I put my baby into the crib one night!!! Nothing I did was different than other nights, it just broke off, causing the crib to lean at an angle. Upon removing her and looking closer, none of the legs were secure like they had been on assembly and couldn't be fixed or screwed back in. We reached out to the company and they refused a refund. This is a safety issue and outrageous. The crib is absolutely adorable but no place for a child.",

                "reviewText": "The crib arrived quickly and was relatively easy and straightforward to set up. The thin mattress (more like a 1/2\u201d pad) that comes with it may be okay if you use it as a playpen, but we bought a thicker mattress to go with it. Love the color combo of the natural wood and green that goes well with our decor. However it arrived with a paint scratch on it, and within a couple days we noticed more paint scratched off. It\u2019s not enough for us to want to return or replace it, but noticeable enough to think the quality might not be the best and the paint will all be rubbed off in a few months. Can\u2019t complain too much for the price, and our son will probably not be in it for too long.",
