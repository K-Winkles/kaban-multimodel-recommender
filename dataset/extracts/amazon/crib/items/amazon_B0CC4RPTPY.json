Not only did it help to be able to lay with him to get him asleep with out moving him but it looks great. It seems pretty sturdy though the side with the gate is a little wobbly but I figured it would be based off other reviews so I have the gate side against the wall.Super easy to put together to me maybe 35 minutes to do by my self.It fit my regular 8in twin size mattress perfectly with no gap. If anything it\u2019s a little snug4stars only because of the gate side but love everything else",

She loves it right away as she can open and get to the bed herself. The bed is on the floor which give me a sense of assurance as she can\u2019t fall off. It\u2019s plenty of room (I got full size). Highly recommended the bed. Tips: choose a memory foam mattress would be better than a spring box mattress",
