Lightweight enough to move it around, but very sturdy. I bought the one without wheels and still has amazing movement and mobility. The open and closed feature are the most convenient for transitioning baby to and from mom. She even brought it with her on her out of state travels. Just bought another one for my expecting SIL.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. UPDATE : Upon returning the bassinet, I was offered a replacement with a new updated version of it and it's amazing! They've added a support shelf that keeps the mattress straight and stable so it can't tilt. Also the way the opening side locks when used as a standalone bassinet has been updated as well and is much more secure than the older version. I'm very pleased with this product now that has been updated it works perfectly for us! As I mentioned in my previous review I loved everything about it and I was sad that I had to send back but now that the issues have been fixed I highly recommend this bassinet if you are looking to have your baby right next to you while still providing a safe sleeping environment!I loved everything about this bassinet, how big it is, how easy it us to maneuver and the fact that you can adjust it ...until after a week of use I found my baby smashed on one side with her face on the padding, 3 times, and I realized this thing tilts towards the open side. I'm sad to return it but this is absolutely unsafe! Beware! If this happened with an 8 lbs baby I can't imagine how it would support a heavier baby since it is supposed to last until 5 months!",
