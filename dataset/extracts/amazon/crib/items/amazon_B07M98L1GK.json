                "reviewText": "At first I was nervous about opening crip packaging. FedEx, along with whoever shipped it from NY, did a terrible job. packaging was torn and holes all over it. Luckily no issues at all. Packaging was ok at best, could be packaged much better. All parts and pieces were thankfully ok, no scratches or breaks. Very easy assembly, takes two adults with minor experience around 1.5-2hours to completely assemble. obviously not solid wood construction, but for the cost and time its worth every penny. looks amazing, drawers work fine. has allot of height adjustment points for mattress. also nice to see it came with a changing table pad. all in all good buy and cant wait to see our first little one in it.",

                "reviewText": "My mattress purchased 4 years ago leaves a 3\u201d gap in the cribs bottom. I had to temporarily use a pool noodle along side the mattress to fill the gap for my 14mth old. Maybe newer mattresses are larger in size or this crib poses serious safety risks for younger babies and suffocating. Just a heads up!Good quality, sturdy, easy to assemble. There was a strong chemical smell the first week so I would suggest assembling and keeping room door open for a few days to air out before placing baby into crib. Great quality for the money spent. Drawer opens and closes very smooth. Drawer is pretty shallow but offers some storage. Crib has a smooth finish and wood slats are flat so easy to clean. No grooves.",
