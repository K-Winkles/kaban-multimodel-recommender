                "reviewText": "I purchased this crib for when I babysit my granddaughter. Since it will not be used a lot, naturally, I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money. This crib is even better than I expected. It also had the appropriate certifications I wanted for safety reasons. It came without a scratch anywhere; and even though it took me a while to assemble it by myself I found it fairly easy. I would suggest that you attach the bottom of the bed to both ends of the bed before you put the front and back sections on the bed. Also, do not completely tighten any of the screws until it\u2019s fully assembled Definitely worth the price and I highly recommend it.",
