                "reviewText": "The baby product I never expected to need or love so much! I bought this to place on the end of the changing table we purchased for our first born. The changing table we had purchased (badger basket sleigh style changing table) came with soft lined drawers and a hamper but zero storage on top for diapers, wipes and necessary accessories. For the price of the storage, I decided to give it a try and have absolutely loved it. Not quite sure what I would have done without it, to be honest. The storage unit is sturdy and made of a clear plastic that is discrete and sits perfectly at the end of our changing table. The height and set up of the unit allows very easy and quick access, which is definitely a necessity for diaper changes. The storage has two small side compartments that can be easily removed and one middle compartment for diapers and wipes. I am able to fit all diapering accessories into the side compartments and quite a few diapers in the middle. The container does come with a plastic divider to allow wipes to sit on top of the diaper stack, however, we decided to remove this piece and just use the middle compartment for diapers only. We use a large sized wipe warmer and found that it didn't fit well enough on the piece. Definitely one of those purchases that I didn't know I needed until I started using it. I'm always a fan for baby products that are just plain practical for every day use! This product falls into that category, for me, and one I'd recommend to anyone looking for a little extra space.",

                "reviewText": "All my daughter's furniture is a variety of Delta Children's products and we own the Delta Eclipse Changing Table, White . We already stocked the diapers, wipes, warmer, etc on the changing table and thought we were ready to go until our instructor at a baby class at the hospital gave us advice on changing our baby. The instructor said it's a good idea to have everything out and ready when you change your baby, as sometimes they can be hyper or throw a fit. If you're not ready to change them, the results could be disastrous. Another tip was to \"have everything should be within arm's reach\", as you will want to place one hand on the baby at all times.Upon learning this, I asked my wife \"isn't there some kind of \"side cart\" for the changing table where you can have the diapers, powder, wipes, lotions, rash paste, etc right there?\" She said there was, so I looked to Amazon to find it. On a side note, despite registering for the Prince Lionheart wipe warmer, I've learned that you never get exactly what you register for - especially on your baby registry. Instead, we got the Munchkin Warm Glow Wipe Warmer - Green as a gift. That warmer itself isn't bad, but the compatible stand ( Munchkin Diaper Duty Organizer ) isn't what we wanted because it has to sit on a flat surface (like a dresser or table). Remember I wanted one that hooks on the side of your changing table \"within an arm's reach\"There are other products that hook onto the side of your changing table, such as Munchkin Diaper Change Organizer and Dexbaby Nursery Organizer, White kind of fit what i'm looking for, but the \"shell\" is made of cloth. Cloth makes things flimsy. I wanted something more rigid and heavy duty.That's when I found the Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot. This thing is awesome. Per the picture, it's got 2 removeable side compartments to store stuff like bottles, cotton balls, rash cream, etc. The middle compartment is for diapers that you pull out from a slat at the bottom. The top part compartment is for baby wipes, which fits your standard wipe case. Although the Munchkin wipe warmer we own doesn't fit on that top compartment for wipes, it still does everything we need to for everything else.Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "While not a perfect fit, it fits securely enough on the side of our Graco Pack N Play. We are able to stack plenty of diapers in the diaper dispenser and set a pack of wipes on top. Some reviews mentioned diapers slipping through the bottom opening of the dispenser. We've not experienced this. Our 7 week old currently uses size 1 diapers, for reference. Perhaps smaller newborn sizes are more prone to slipping out.The side compartments are great for storing other items you may want readily available such as lotion, diaper rash creams, and grooming tools. We love how organized it keeps our changing system-- way better than having to run to the nursery for diapers or having to bend down and gather items from a diaper caddy that sits on the ground. This product allows our Pack N Play to double as an efficient changing station, keeping all the products we need conveniently within reach every time we go to change a diaper. Highly recommend to anyone who is currently using a Graco Pack N Play as their baby's crib and/or changing station.While this is organizer is compatible with the Pack N Play, I don't recommend it for an actual full-size crib though. Our crib is made of wood and the sides are far too thick for this diaper caddy to hang on to.",
