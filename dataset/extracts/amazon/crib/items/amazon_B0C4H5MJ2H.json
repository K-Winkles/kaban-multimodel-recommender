We had the issue of not having a safe place for her to sleep when out, so now this just stays in the trunk and we never have to worry about it again. Folds up great and has a nice travel bag. Literally just an all in one thing. Good metal piping to so its sturdy.",

We plan to keep this in the car so we have it handy whenever the need arises while visiting friends and family. It takes up so little room, and comes with its own carrying case.

                "reviewText": "This travel crib was so easy to use straight out of the box! The setup literally took just a few minutes. The soft gray color with the adorable puppy design is gender neutral and could be used for multiple children over the years. I especially like that it has an upper bassinet level that you can use for infants, and the mattress has a panel that just zips off so that it fits in the smaller upper level. The zipper doorway on the bottom is cute to allow toddlers to crawl in/out. Some people might not like that the bottom of the crib sits flat on the ground, but I don't mind. This is a wonderful, easy to use travel crib, and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again!",
