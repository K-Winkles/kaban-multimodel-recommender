                "reviewText": "So looking at the reviews for this, a lot of people either said it was great or complained about making it or missing parts or whatever. No one really talked about how well their child slept in it or how it worked as a toddler bed (which was why I got it in the first place). First I'll talk about the crib space and assembly because 1) its not as bad as it seems and 2) that'll take longer than talking about how he sleeps in it.My son's about 1 1/2 and he sleeps in it just fine, and I would assume a newborn would as well. He was fussy the first night cause of the change of bed probably, but he doesn't really care now. The 1st drawer we have about 2 days of daipers, 1 bag of wipes, trash bags for daipers, and any medicines for him. 2nd is sheets and blankets (only a few) and 3rd and clothes (none of the drawers are cramped full). The drawers aren't that small compared to what others say (in my opinion) but if you have a newborn then yeah you might feel you need more space but if you organize it well it'll be fine. (I tried to see what space would be like for a newborn since my cousins having a kid soon and I managed to arrange things well enough)The bottom draw below the crib fits all the rest of his clothes. Its got a lot of space so that's probably where all the clothes will go for most people. The side shelves in the back we have a towel for baths and two packs of wipes and diapers. The two shelves fit a whole pack of huggies snug and dry size 5 daipers (132) and there's still some space for more so excess daipers go there. The changing table aslo isn't that small. My sons pretty tall and still fits it fine (again it depends on the kid).The crib, according to my husband, was \"very easy and quick to put together. People might get caught up in putting the drawers and changing table together, but follow the instructions and take your time and you should be fine.\" And while he does put our house stuff together, he's no builder. It took all together a few hours becuase we kept having to stop working on it but it turned out great. No missing pieces. No broken parts. Some people probably just got a bad crib. Also the shelves go in and out fine not lopsided or crooked or whatever.Ok now that thats done. Onto the sleeping. As I said my son sleeps fine. He likes the space to crawl around when he's awake. The day bed works nice for when he wants to lie down or nap or when he wants us to sit with him, though its wierd sometimes cause its supposed to be a crib. I said before that I got this for when he needs a toddler bed and as he starts to use it more for that, I'll update this because no one talks about their toddler using the bed either. But all in all he sleeps in it fine, its comfortable for him, and it works like any other crib I've seen. Obviously people will have their problems with it, but I think its fine. I feel like for most of the reviews saying bad things they're just being nitpicky (bad changing table or small space in drawers), but I'd give this a chance. Graco hasn't let me down before.EDIT:So we took the side railing once at first to see how our son liked it but we kept the railing on after since there was no need to take it off again at the time. About a month or so ago we took the railing off for good so to make it a toddler bed. We haven't gotten the toddler railing yet but we don't seem to need it. Obviously it's still the same bed our son just has the freedom to get out when he wants and he likes it. The only real difference is he loves to open and shut his drawers now. He can only grab through the holes on them though so he doesn't smash his fingers or anything. But if you have a kid who does stuff like that get ready to see some clothes or diapers thrown across the floor sometimes \ud83d\ude05 Overall still good a good bed. Not much different that before other than he's gotten more adventurous since he got some more freedom. I'm glad this review has helped you if it has and hopefully you end up happy with whatever bed you get for your kid!",

I\u2019ve been using it for a year now and it is still standing strong and perfect for my now rowdy 1 year old. I loved how you could raise the bed all the way for the newborn stage and lower it all the way down as he grew. This was especially helpful after just giving birth and not having to lean over the crib railing. I love all the storage space and it has been perfect so far. Only thing I have to complain about is that it doesn\u2019t come with the railing to convert to a toddler bed. Definitely well worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "Crib is a nice design and seems sturdy. The assembly process is very time consuming and there are many little parts to put together. Took my husband a few hours. There were three crib parts in our order that were damaged. We ordered a white crib. One piece had a yellow paint on the entire front piece that wouldn't wipe off. Two other pieces had large chips and scuff marks/ paint chips. I asked for replacement parts from storkcraft. The solution was for them to send me a \"touch up pen\" so I had to send a second email and explain to them the damages were too large for a touch up pen. They agreed to send me new parts. I waited a month for them and when they arrived the replacement parts were more damaged then the original parts. One piece was good but there was two huge Cracks in the second piece and a blood splatter on the wood. Third piece had another chip and scuff. I requested they send me another replacement part for the 2 damaged pieces. I've been waiting 2 weeks now for them and they informed me the warehouse may be out of them and they'll let me know in a few days. They said they would not refund or discount my crib and I needed to do that through Amazon as well as send it back if refunded. Huge hassle and we don't have the box anymore and baby is coming in a few weeks and needs a crib. Absolutely horrible service from both amazon and storkcraft. This is not a cheap crib. For the price I paid I would expect better quality of product and service. Clearly they need new warehouse staff or need to store their replacement parts better. Absolutely horrible service from storkcraft and Amazon and a crib is definetly not worth this headache. Would recommend looking elsewhere to avoid a mess like this.",
