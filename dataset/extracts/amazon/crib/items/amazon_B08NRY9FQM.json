                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This was by far one of the worst purchases I\u2019ve made on Amazon. The quality was HORRIBLE. Directly out of the box, there where blue streaks all throughout the paint, as if they used one coat of cheap white paint & the blue undertones were showing through. It was riddled with random holes and indentations, some of which were attempted to be painted over. Where each beam met the bases (shown in video) there were scrapes, holes, and chips missing as if the holes created for them to fit in were too big and/or just shoved in. There was also this yellowish colored gunk (possibly glue residue?) all around the holes\u2026.every hole lol there were random holes on the front and back sides of each piece. I waited for this crib to come and was very much looking forward to it, and was met by this tragedy. I\u2019m 9months pregnant w/ a due date in just weeks. I immediately started crying when I saw this. I was hoping that it was just issues that would be hidden on the inside, but no. I didn\u2019t even put assembly it of course. I reached out to customer service for a replacement to get it here asap, one that was hopefully in better condition, but that wasn\u2019t an option so I had to go with my original crib, which fortunately is back in stock. It smelled as cheap as it looked. Like cheap wooden scraps. Overall, it was full of defects and the appearance was trash. The paint was done so poorly and the quality of the wood seemed even worse. I can\u2019t believe this is something that was sent out confidently. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this to even a dog!",
