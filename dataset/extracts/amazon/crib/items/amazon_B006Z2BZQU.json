Using this instead of a bassinet for our newborn, I love the extra protection it provides compared to a bassinet with out the bulk of a full size crib. Love it",

                "reviewText": "We bought this for our little one in hopes that it would fit in the narrow space we have between windows - and it did. It's not the highest quality crib but it certainly will do for an infant/toddler. We chose this particular brand because unlike other mini cribs, it converts to a toddler day bed without having to rig something or buy additional parts (although it does not include a toddler bed rail). We also like the idea of being able to use it for a twin, should we choose to buy the twin from set.The crib did arrive with a few MINOR scratches which wouldn't have been noticeable if we'd ordered it in french white but because it's a for pine and we ordered Cherry - your eye is drawn to them. I doubt this crib will escape it's purpose without further dings - so there's now point in sending it back. Assembly was easy and once together it's a rather sturdy little piece.We had a hard time wrapping our brain around the size of a mini crib, so I've included a photo of it with a boppy pillow in it. I've also included a picture of the crib with the mattress pad it arrived with (we've ordered another mattress, but it it hasn't arrived yet). I will say, this crib seems to be great value for money!Update: Our now 17 month old who is in the 90th lercentile for height, loves this mini crib. It is sturdy, and he continues to sleep comfortably in it. I\u2019m not sure it will be long enough to use as a toddler bed but we can easily transition to a twin bed if need be.",
