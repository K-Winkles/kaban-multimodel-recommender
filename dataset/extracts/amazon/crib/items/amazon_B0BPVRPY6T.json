Nice mini crib for a tight area that you need a crib in or if you just need a mini one for your little who will be sleeping in your room if you plan to breastfeed etc like we plan to do. An upgrade from a bassinet since it\u2019s more sturdy and you don\u2019t have to worry about your baby growing out of it as soon as they learn to sit up. Great quality, perfect size and the mini crib mattress sheets we got fit this well also. Assembly was like your standard crib but easier in my opinion because it isn\u2019t as big! We are very happy with this!",

                "reviewText": "This crib was easy to put together. It's not too heavy with the option to raise the bed frame up or down. The advertisement for it is a little confusing as I thought I was getting more than just the crib. It's smaller than you think. It's a little wobbly when it's just the day bed but still will work as long as your not rough with it. It does look nice though. I don't think it would be worth it to get the other attachments for it.",

Probably could use BROWN too.=expandability, once you're done with the crib, you can change to a toddler bed, then finally a larger bed=Award winning=Trusted brand=Actually gives you a mattress with a coverCons=requires the bd conversion kit to convert to the last 2 modes and that is a $120+ purchase. On top of that, the review for them are pretty bad.",

                "reviewText": "I love how small and cute this crib is. We made the mistake of buying a full sized crib for our first child and we used it for maybe a month and the set up was very lengthy. This crib was way easier to set up and didn't take up as much room. It's also convertible and a fraction of the price. It's a win all around. I'm keeping this around for all the kids.",
