I looked all over the Internet comparing cribs- both price and quality. I instantly knew that I would be purchasing a Foundations crib once I found them! I loved that it clearly stated in the description that they met all of the guidelines for child care centers- that made this an easy choice for me! Also, I loved that Amazon offered this crib cheaper then the website that I originally found it on! The only thing is I wish Amazon offered the zippered crib sheets like that website did, I had to purchase those separately, but I'm glad that they were available because I love the idea of zippered crib sheets! Highly recommend this crib, looks great in by baby room! :)",

This crib has met all of my criteria and I am very pleased with the ease of construction as well. I was able to assemble the piece myself in about a half hour. The base is sturdy and the mattress that was included is thick enough in my opinion. I also like that it has teething rail protectors included. I would like to mention as well that this crib is not very tall. Which is a plus for me being 5'2 and my husband is only 5'9 so this is perfect for us. All in all I am pleased with this purchase and hope when the baby comes they'll like it too!",

The only negative is the fact that the entire bed needs to be put together with the allen wrenches and so when you raise and lower the mattress height the allen wrenches get stripped easily.",

                "reviewText": "I had ordered this crib because I recently got another one just like it and loved it. BUT when I went to assemble it, it was not like the product's description. It does not have the teething rail covering and it does not have the metal box mattress frame (it is springs). I feel like it is misleading to customers that are buying the crib for these features like I was. Unfortunately I do not have the option of returning it and have to use the crib despite my displeasure with it.",
