We were so worried, and then someone suggested a crib bumper. I never saw one before, and this one was exactly what we needed. This gives us peace of mind at night now.",

This works perfect and just short enough where I can squeeze it from end to end of the toddler bed. However, if put under a regular toddler sheet, the sheets won\u2019t stay down at the corners. We have one sheet that\u2019s a little looser and works well. Wish I could find more sheets like that but other than that we love it",

I highly recommend this to anyone that has a crib that doesn\u2019t convert to a toddle bed with the rails or for anyone that co-sleeps. We\u2019ll probably still use this when our baby grows and gets an even bigger bed. It\u2019s so convenient. We have had no problems so far and the packaging was not damaged or torn.",

                "reviewText": "My kiddo is pretty good about staying in his own bed but of course at least once a week we end up in the guest bed in his room together. He\u2019s fallen off before even though it\u2019s a queen so this bumper was the perfect solution! I never wanted to try the metal rails because they seem too permanent and difficult to get in the bed but I liked that this one could be climbed over and moved from room to room or stored for travel.It takes less than 1 minute to place under the fitted sheet and it\u2019s so soft yet doesn\u2019t move! It\u2019s a good height so it\u2019s safe but also my son can climb over it (and thinks it\u2019s fun). I wish I would have gotten one of these sooner so I wasn\u2019t doing a middle of the night pillow protection on the bed all the time. Great gift for a baby shower or birthday! Now I\u2019m only wishing I got the 2 pack!",
