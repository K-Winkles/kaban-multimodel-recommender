                "reviewText": "Bought this for a child for occasional use in a small apartment. It comes completely flat out of the box and it's very easy to snap the legs onto the frame, zip up the middle that holds the mattress and its ready to use.Folding it back down for travel/storage is easy peasy. The item is lightweight enough that it can be easily moved between rooms. The feature where the bottom of the legs turn so that the crib will sway a little is very nice.As far as the mattress itself is concerned, the mattress can be removed from the cover to be washed. I then took while it was out of the provided cover and put my own crib mattress sheet on it. When the cover had been washed and dried I placed the wood base only back inside that coverlet and dropped back into place and zipped around it. Then I laid the mattress with the new sheet on top of the zippered around wood base and it fits just as tight around the crib as it did within the provided mattress cover. In this way I am easily able to change the sheet when spit ups often happen. I'm not sure I could have gotten the mattress to go back inside that really tight cover with the wood base anyway. A VERY tight fit it is!I do LOVE everything about this smaller crib and cannot wait to see how well it continues to grow with the child.",

Looks great, sturdy, and most importantly our baby slept.Thoughts... It's plastic, not wood. It's heavier than a pak n play, wish we had one at home.",
