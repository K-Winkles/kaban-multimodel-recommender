My fault though I was too excited to out together I didn\u2019t wait for my partner. It\u2019s nice and sturdy, perfect color, and fits perfectly in the room.",

The only thing we did have an issue with was a bolt and nut set had broken and we did replace it ourself,, however we did not contact the company to request a replacement peice. Would deffinately consider buying again if i needed a second crib!",

It comes with a thin mattress but I recommend to buy an extra one from Graco\u00ae\ufe0f Crib and Toddler MATTRESS-in-a-BOX. As a reference to show how big this crib is, I took a picture of how many tiles on the floor it takes. (3X4) nothing missing, nothing damaged like mentioned in other comments.All you need is a clear/well lit room and patience in order to build this up.",
