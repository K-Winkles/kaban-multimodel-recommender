I also found the directions in mine to be just fine, and I like that it has a chew guard.HOWEVER.The hardware strips VERY easily, so be very gentle and precise with the barrel nuts in particular. If you have to build this without another person, it is going to take at least an hour or two. I tried to tackle this while my husband was at work and the amount of trouble it would have saved me just to have another set of hands is insane. I found it very challenging to build alone. I had to flip and turn it several times and hold things up with all four limbs. Just a heads up. I like the crib though \ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "We bought two of these cribs in 2020 for our twins, so at the time of writing this review and our cribs have been in use for just over 2 years. I\u2019ll go over my major pros and cons.Pros:- Sturdy. We\u2019ve assembled and reassembled these cribs twice now and each time the screws have stayed tight. The one exception is my child who likes to hang or pull on the front rail, it has loosened somewhat in the last few months but it\u2019s easy to tighten back up.- Neutral. The natural finish doesn\u2019t trend too yellow or orange, as natural finishes sometimes do. It\u2019s a nice neutral pine and is easy to match to bedroom decor.- It\u2019s been extremely easy to lower the height of the mattress as my twins have gotten older.- Assembly in general has been a breeze and the instructions are easy to follow.Cons:- Didn\u2019t include toddler bed rail. The pictures and description made it seem like the toddler bed rail was included, but ours did not have it and it would be a separate purchase if we wanted it.These cribs have been a great purchase for us! Overall we really like them and only have the one complaint about the toddler rail. It\u2019s cheaper to just convert it to the daybed option and put a foam bumper at the edge of the mattress. My twins did a number on the tops of the sides while teething, but I think with a little sanding the bite marks will rub out. When we purchased, many reviews mentioned you have to get a Dream on Me mattress because others don\u2019t fit. We paired the crib with the Milliard Hypoallergenic Baby Crib Mattress and it\u2019s been perfect.",

F and G parts are labelled with the wrong stickers so assembling equired a bit of troubleshooting. Love a good puzzle. The base is a bit rusted where it was not painted.Sturdy enough, nice looking. Can't beat the price for solid wood. Will do the trick for now.",

I\u2019m just dropped the mattress down now that she is standing. Definitely recommend, especially if you are looking for a similar crib to the trendy IKEA natural wood crib and want to spend less! Also want to mention that I had reached out to Dream On Me\u2019s customer service for replacement hardware that we misplaced when we moved. We are able to get it and customer service was very responsive, although I did have to pay a little bit to have them send it to me. But glad we were able to get it!",

                "reviewText": "We've been using this crib a year and a half now and love it. The only negative points are: 1. Instructions aren't super clear and require a bit more thought than a sleep deprived parent would like, and 2. The cost of the side rail for the conversion to a toddler bed. In my opinion, it's really dumb to sell the support rail with the main crib but not the side part. Save your money and get a $20 one that fits almost the entire length of the bed, which is what we did. We can also take it with us on trips, which you can't do with the wooden piece sold separately.It looks nice in our son's room and I'm glad I got the basic pine/light wood color. I really feel this will stand up to several more kids. My kiddo isn't a biter, so I can't speak to the durability there. We added a mesh bumper inside to help keep his paci and lovey in the bed with him, which has worked well. The standard crib mattress fits well too, and I'd also recommend the Amazon basics jersey crib sheets. They're super soft & comfy and wash really well. I got two from my registry and ended up buying two more because I loved them so much. Almost bought the Ikea version of this crib, but ended up with amazon gift cards we needed to use and I'm glad we went with this crib.",

                "reviewText": "I originally gave this crib 5 stars despite mislabeled pieces making asembly difficult. I chose it because I loved its minimalist look and price. Now that my daughter is almost 6 months old I feel like I need to rewrite my this review. The bars on this crib are DANGEROUS. My baby has been getting hung up between the bars since she started rolling. I am scared to leave her in it. I just set her down in it this afternoon so I could hang my coat and pee when we got home. (not even in the crib 3 minutes) and she managed to get her leg stuck so bad between the bars. I was terrified. She was so afraid and in pain and her leg was red and purple. I was crying. She was crying. HORRIBLE. I almost called the fire department to get her unstuck it was so bad. She ended up with a bruise and marks. It chills me to the bone knowing it could have been worse.There is something really really wrong with the design of the bars. I did not have the same problems with the crib I used for my older kids. If you are on a budget please for the sake of your child do not buy this crib. Choose another. I am going to have to figure out something different for my baby as this crib is unsafe. This is the last straw with this crib. She has gotten caught before but this time it was a serious scare. It looks nice. Price is nice. But it was a waste of money because nothing is more important than my baby\u2019s safety.",
