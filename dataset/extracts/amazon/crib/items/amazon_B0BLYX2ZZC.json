I love the extra storage space on the bottom. It is very sturdy and durable. I like that there is mesh on the sides so I can see my baby through the mesh. The padding inside seems to be very comfortable for my baby and I am very happy with the quality of it. This would be a great gift for any mom",

Pictures are useless, with no close up shots. But if you have common sense, you\u2019ll figure it out.- Wheels are convenient for mobility, but plastic wheels seem flimsy. Wheels also does not roll smoothly.- It\u2019s nice to have the feature of lowering side rail for unobstructed view / access to baby, but is not something you will do on demand. It is very annoying to do. If you want it lowered permanently / on a day-to-day basis, it\u2019s fine.- Rocking feature range of motion is limited, but nice to have the option.",

I also like how quick the material cleans.I don't like how it slightly rocks when not in rocking mode. My 9lbs new born immediately rolls to the right and sometimes to the left because of it. I also don't care for the mattress it came with but I rather it be a little harder than softer.",

There is not a lot of room to reach in and get anything out of the basket. When I put it to rock, it is extremely jerky. I was hoping there was one that I could gently rock with my hand or my foot either way. It has to be pushed and is jerky. When I put my newborn grandbaby in the bed, long ways, it rolls him over to the side because it is not sturdy. I end up having to lay him sideways or at an angle.It is easy to lay down the side. However, you have to take the canopy off every single time and then put it back on.Again, I am so disappointed in this product.",
