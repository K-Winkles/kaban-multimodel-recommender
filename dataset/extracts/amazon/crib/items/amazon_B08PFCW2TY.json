                "reviewText": "We are traveling and needed a crib for a 2yo special needs boy who is about 38in long. He really does not fit in a pack N play anymore, its too short. I searched all around and found this was the longest (47 inches) portable/foldable crib. The set up was very easy, esp if you know pack n plays. We have not used it yet and I can't comment on durability. It looks pretty well made. Its the size of a pack N play when folded up, so I was certain it wouldn't be as long as stated, but it was! I wish we'd bought these instead, this is our last son and we have two others that got too long for pack n plays but we still needed to use them, they just had to sleep crunched up. The zipper door would have been awesome for our boys too. This is spendy -- esp because you can get used pack n plays free or cheaply on marketplaces. But if you need a longer pack n play -- I haven't seen any others that are this long.",

The folding pad that your infant is supposed to lay on is basically cardboard like and the padding is very, very thin and there are spots on the boards where it feels like there is no padding at all. The entire product is poorly made. Also after putting this in my cart on Amazon they offered a thin mattress topper to go with the playpen. I purchased it as well, and low and behold, it\u2019s too wide and too short for the playpen. I also purchased the matching sheets for the mattress topper. They too are useless to me. Now I have 3 different purchases to return because the descriptions were incorrect! Buyer beware!",
