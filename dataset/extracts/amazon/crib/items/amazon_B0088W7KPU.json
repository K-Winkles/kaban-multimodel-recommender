                "reviewText": "This was very easy for my husband to assemble and looks just as beautiful as in the photo. The espresso color matches our black-brown wooden furniture perfectly; it's a wonderful addition to our bedroom, and all the storage space it comes with (drawers in the front of the changer and shelving in the back) means not having to use any closet or dresser space for baby's things, and still having room for toys!The crib itself is very sturdy, but the changing table unfortunately won't support more than about 35 lbs of weight. Hopefully by then the little one is potty-trained anyway, but we're still going to err on the side of caution and stop using the top part of the storage compartment as a changer before then. The other issue we had with the changing station is that, as other reviewers have mentioned, the changing pad that comes with the crib is very hard and unpleasant, but it is very difficult to find a different pad to replace it that will actually fit on the changing table. Our solution was to simply \"make\" the Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad (which I highly recommend -- it is very squishy and the covers are very soft and come in loads of colors) fit. With the bottom of the changing pad lined up with the bottom of the changing table (that little gap is too small for a changing pad to squish out of), we pushed the Summer Infant changing pad down so it was lying on the bottom of the changing table, which leaves about five inches extra in length curving upwards along the top. The result is basically a little elevation for the little one's head, like a gentle pillow. This works just fine for me, since I wasn't enthusiastic about baby potentially hitting his head on the bars in the back, and it still looks great.Overall these are such minor complaints compared to how awesome this crib is overall. You really can't beat the price for getting four children's beds, a dresser, a bookshelf, and a changing table all in one, especially with the quality with which it was designed. I spent months shopping around for just the right crib at just the right price and I am very, very happy with the result.",

                "reviewText": "Our little one hasn't made her appearance yet, but we're really excited about this crib. It's very heavy, so unless you can handle getting it inside by yourself make sure you have someone lined up to help you the day it's being delivered. I got mine inside the door then opened it there and carried all the various pieces upstairs, which wasn't too bad. It just meant it had to be done on the day it showed up.As far as assembly, it took me around 2.5 hours to do it by myself. My wife offered moral support but that was about the limit. The instructions weren't always the best. There are a lot of pre-drilled holes in the frame so that the crib can be converted to the daybed, toddler bed, and then to the headboard/foot-board of a full size bed, so it was sometimes confusing which hole out of 3 you were supposed to be putting the bolt through. At the end of the day, though, if you were assembling it correctly then it made it obvious what screw went where. Two assembly points. First, during the assembly of the shelves, at one point it says you need to lay the whole dresser part on its side. This wasn't necessary, I put all the pieces in with it standing upright with no problem. Because I had all the pieces sitting around it, there was no way I could have tipped it over. Second, if possible, assemble it in the center of the room then move it against the wall. There are some screws that go in the back of it that were really difficult to get in without good access to all four sides of the crib.Pros:Very SturdyNice clean finished lookNice size changing table (with pad included)Pre-drilledCons:Not the best instructionsVery heavy/hard to moveLots of extra pieces to store for when you want to convert the bed to its other forms",

                "reviewText": "We found this crib on Sears website and really liked it because the change table was straight instead of the more common side changing setup. Obviously we checked around to see if it was cheaper somewhere else and found it here on Amazon.Like a lot of the other great reviews on this crib/change table, it came in a pretty beat up package but the way it was double boxed and wrapped in foam and packed with styrofoam, nothing was damaged. All the pieces were there as well.It's actually made from solid wood and is very sturdy. I like to think that I'm decently good at assembling things and this thing took about 3 hours to put together. The instructions were pretty good but I did get ahead of myself on a few pages and had to disassemble a step or two. Make sure you do it exactly as it shows...do not try to assemble without instructions!In the picture you can see open holes everywhere and it looks like you can see all of the screws and bolts and what-not but when it's assembled it looks better than the picture.It comes with a change table pad. It's a bit thin (so my wife says) but as a guy it looks like it should do the trick just fine.If anyone is curious, it does not come with a mattress but it fits your regular Walmart size crib/baby mattress.You can adjust the height of the mattress with a little effort. The top setting would/will be perfect for a newborn. I can see when the child gets a bit older that they'll want to start climbing onto the change table part of this crib so that's something to consider if you think you'll have an energetic little one!It does work to JUST have the crib or JUST the change table but you can't have both separately. If you want just the crib, you have to use one of the walls from the change table which has a bunch of drawer sliders attached to it and I personally think it would look quite ugly unless you had that side against a wall or something.On the right hand side there's shelves you can install for extra storage (behind the drawers)There are instructions to turn the thing into a bed with the half wall, and also use the two railing pieces to turn the bed into a bed with an actual mattress but you would still need to buy a frame for the mattress. You could only use the railings for a headboard and footboard (footboard?). It comes with everything else that you need to do the conversions.Overall this thing is BEAUTIFUL. I love it, my wife loves it, and our newest addition to the family is sure to love it. You won't find a better crib at this price. Just be aware, it's big. Overall 5 stars easily!",

                "reviewText": "The package is heavy -- We had it delivered to the garage and then carried the pieces individually upstairs. Much easier than carrying the entire box. Assembly was easy (under 2.5 hours) once all of the components were identified and organized. No issues with missing pieces. You will need a lot of room to assemble this crib (we had an empty nursery). Once assembled, it's VERY nice. Quality is top notch. It's sturdy and well designed and great quality wood. Only downside is that it smells chemically/plastic-y/new. We left the window open for a few days until the smell went away. If buying, I would recommend setting it up at least a week (if not two) before the baby is due. I wouldn't want to put a newborn in the room right after assembly. Other than that, great quality at a great price.",
