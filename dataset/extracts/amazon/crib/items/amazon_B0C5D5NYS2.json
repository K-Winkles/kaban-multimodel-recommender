After a lot of comparing with other brands, I put this one on my registry. I loved it because it had a rocking feature! It was easy to assemble and after looking at everything I noticed I was missing the two rocking tubes that go on the sides. I\u2019ve contacted the company through email and never got a response. Hopefully Amazon can help me more in the future and I can give a better review.",
