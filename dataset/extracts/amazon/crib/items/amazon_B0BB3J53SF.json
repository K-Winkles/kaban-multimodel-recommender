                "reviewText": "This 5-in-1 convertible crib is well made and beautifully designed. I love that it grows with my child so I don't have to buy a new bed every few years since babies grow quickly. I really like this cribs adjustable mattress support base has two different height options so I can choose the right one for my childs age. The newborn height option is wonderful when your baby is just born because bending way down is not easy after just having a baby so this option helps provide easier access to get your infant in and out of the crib. This crib is easy to assemble. The instructions are clear and simple to follow. All the pieces go together properly without any issues. This is a beautiful well made crib that is well made and durable. I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for something that will last and grow with your child.",

                "reviewText": "Your going to need a flat head screw driver.The bed has some gabs in the head board so you can see some screws but it's not a major flaw.Assembly was easy for my husband he got confused a few times but he did it. Very sturdy because my 2 year old already jumped on it when we were making the bed. A toddler mattress from Walmart fit inside we had one from my sons old bed. This bed offers style as well as affordable when it comes to being a 3 and 1. This is not just a crib it's your child's growth and something you can cherish ad they grow. You get that packet to store your instructions in it to be able to change the bed later. You also get the papers to register it to you in case of a recall. I would call this bed and color any gender its flawless sleek and different from. Your basic crib.",

We didn't have any issues with it. The instructions sit on the topside of the mattress frame/under the mattress which I thought was very convenient! The back board seems a little on the thin side, I'm not sure how long that will last. The four stars is because one of our boards had a decent sized dent in it straight out of the box.",
