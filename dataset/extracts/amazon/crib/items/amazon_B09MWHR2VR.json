It wakes the baby up every time. Then also the mesh isn\u2019t that see through, and there are no crib sheets to fit the mattress so you have to wash it if the baby spits up, which means you can\u2019t use the bassinet unless you\u2019re all over your laundry. With a newborn it\u2019s kind of a pain.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying that we really love this bassinet now that it\u2019s put together, and are very pleased with our purchase. But assembly wasn\u2019t super fun.How to stress out a 38 week pregnant lady: have her put this together. I typically let my husband put things together, but had a bout of nesting and wanted it together immediately, so I did it myself while he was working. I didn\u2019t find some of the instructions to be super clear. For example, I couldn\u2019t tell exactly where they wanted the side brackets to go- and after inserting them, I realized they weren\u2019t thread through the fabric pockets (because the instructions didn\u2019t make it known how important that was). Getting them unsnapped took all of my body weight (which is a lot right now) as well as jamming a screwdriver into the side to get the little plastic hooks to unlatch. It made me very angry.Another point of frustration was that one of the \u201cfeet\u201d didn\u2019t arrive with its white plastic bottom/stoppers attached, it was floating freely in the box, and it was very hard to jam into the metal.My husband helped me with the last few steps, and we were so pleasantly surprised at how nicely it glides under our bed and rests on top, without even being on the highest setting. We have a sleepnumber bed that sits a bit higher, so although I measured before ordering, I was still worried that somehow this wouldn\u2019t be tall enough- but it definitely is, and then some!I like that baby will be super close to us in bed, and my husband likes that he will be able to easily look over and see baby too. We actually had a bassinet before this one (the beside me Wink) that we were planning to use (sat very low, didn\u2019t go over the bed, didn\u2019t have the swaying feature like this does) but when we saw this we knew it would work so much better for us!The swaying feature works great, though you do have to unlock it from the back, which would be a little annoying to do if you\u2019re laying in bed and want to sway baby in the middle of the night. It\u2019d be nice if this lock was accessible from the front somehow. The bassinet also very easily lifts up and off of the base with the use of the side handles, so if you want to lift baby and take them to another room, that would be very convenient to do!Lastly, the mattress pad is very thin and easy to pull off (just Velcro) so you could toss this in the wash very easily. However, I wish that you could buy extra pads or that a bassinet sheet worked with this (it doesn't) so that you could switch out the sheet while washing.All in all, we are happy with this and I think it will be convenient for us as first time parents once we bring our newborn home!",

I would definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to love this bassinet. There are so many great features. It\u2019s aesthetically pleasing, and loved the grid base that the mattress sits on. The one major design flaw- and the reason I am returning is the mattress. I asked how thick the mattress was and received no response so I ordered it to see. It is extremely thin\u2014 only .5 inch. The material it is made out of is low density so if you press down on it, you can feel the base (and the grid part of it) through the mattress. I have a hard time believing it would be comfortable for a baby. I do realize that babies need firm surfaces, but this would be like laying on a hard floor. I compared it to my old bassinet (Halo) mattress which is just a pretty standard ~1\u201d poly foam mattress (and really isn\u2019t the best), and even if felt way better than this one. On top of all that, there are no sheets you can purchase for it, and you can\u2019t buy a replacement so that you have an extra if baby spits up or has a blow out??? What is baby supposed to sleep on while you wait for it to hang dry? Anyways, I felt like there was so much potential with this bassinet, and perhaps the company will redesign with a better mattress! I would love to see it with a breathable mattress like the Halo Dreamweave or Newton style mattress.",
