                "reviewText": "If you are looking into this product, I am sure you are aware of the dangers of regular crib bumpers contributing to SIDS and suffocation. I had a regular bumper on my daughter's crib for a very short time and then became too worried and I removed it. I thought she would be okay without any bumper, but then she would wiggle to the side of the crib and her feet, although she was swaddled, would end up between the slats which would in turn wake her up. So I bought this bumper and I am so glad I did! It does have slight padding between two layers of mesh, so even though it is breathable, you will still get some protection from bumps. It is easy to install and uses velcro and a few ties and is adjustable to any crib. It goes down on the sides between the mattress and crib so it won't pull up or move around. The color is nice, too, and the satin edging makes it look more elegant...just mesh without the satin trim would look tacky. I am very happy with this purchase and have recommended it to other people as well! I really think this is a must have if you have a baby that moves around a lot. Even if you don't buy this, you really should not have a regular bumper in your child's crib, it just isn't worth the risk.",

                "reviewText": "My 4 1/2 month old has gotten herself caught twice in between the slats, once her arm and once her leg. She SCREAMED and needed \"rescuing.\" I know it's not life threatening, but obviously uncomfortable and/or scary. When it was her leg she had red marks from pressing against the slat so hard. Babies don't know that they're not really stuck and can pull their limbs straight out. I didn't want a padded bumper since babies have suffocated against them. This bumper is great.Even though the instructions are for a solid crib (as drop-sides are now illegal), it's obviously still the same design for a drop-side. If they redesigned it then maybe they're wouldn't be so much layering where the two pieces come together. Then it may be slimmer and look nicer. But it works, and I'm grateful for the fact it exists and is fairly priced.If you follow the instructions, you actually don't have any gaps as one reviewer's photos show. It's solid all the way around.It is slightly padded for those worried about comfort. But honestly, I haven't seen any of my three babies care about smashing themselves up against the slats. :)My only problem with it is that the two ribbons that tie to the center slats on the front and back are sewn on with a simple straight stitch, and not a tight one at that. When I went to install it, one ribbon snapped off, with virtually no resistance. I was pulling it snug, as directed, and saw that it wasn't attached at the center where I had tied it. The ribbon was still tied, but had popped cleanly out from under the satin trim. No biggie. I was able to sew it (and put that ribbon in the back). But it could certainly be manufactured better. My husband was hesitant to use it at all after that, but I don't see it coming off again. The other side is holding just fine.Also, the instructions are difficult to follow. But in all fairness, I don't know how they could have explained it better. Assembly is confusing by nature of design of the bumper. It works the way it is, and I was able to figure it out with a little trial and error. A video would be more helpful than written instructions.I haven't had any problems as other reviewers described where the baby just pushes the bumper down and sticks their arms and legs out anyway. But then my girl is still very young. And she's also tall with long arms and legs, so smaller babies would be just fine too. I figure if she's old enough to where she does that, then she's old enough to pull her limbs back into the crib. As it is it is really very high and I don't see her being able to reach the top. Just make sure the bottom of the bumper is lined up with the top of the mattress, as you would normally attach any kind of bumper.",
