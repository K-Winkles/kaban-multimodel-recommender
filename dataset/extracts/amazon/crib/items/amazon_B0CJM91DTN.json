                "reviewText": "I got this because I don't have a nightstand or dresser anymore (house got trashed by flooding from a hurricane, have had to re-do everything & just can't afford to replace *all* the furniture), and I have a lot of stuff that I use in/near the bed - my kindle especially, but also ear plugs, chapstick, books, Flonase, phone sometimes, etc. And this lined up perfectly with the slats of the bedframe to tie it in place, and it's inconspicuous and really cute. I really like that it's fabric, so it's totally washable if it ever gets dusty/dirty. And it really holds a decent amount of stuff, I have all those things in there and there's still plenty of extra space left. Now, even in the dark, I can reach into the pocket & grab my ear plugs or kindle without having to turn on the light, bump around making noise, etc. & wake everyone else up. So, it's really helpful for me, & now I don't just have junk piled up on the windowsill next to the bed anymore. I love it.And this would also work great for a crib or a kid's bed, too, I would think. I checked & it also lines up with the slats on my daughter's bed, so it would tie onto there fine too.Definitely 5 stars on this one.",

It looks very chic and would go with a range of nursery decor themes.This could even be used to attach to an adult slatted headboard, as a remote or glasses holder, or whatever.Great value for quality material and a well-made item.I\u2019d recommend.",
