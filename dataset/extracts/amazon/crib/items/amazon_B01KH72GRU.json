                "reviewText": "We purchased this crib because we were looking for something that was simple looking, reasonable, white, had good reviews and would maximize space (hence the drawer).Overall it was pretty easy to put together - helps to have two people working on it. Some of the steps had pictures that made it a bit difficult to follow - work slowly and keep double checking the picture for orientation of pieces. Once put together - we haven\u2019t had any issues with the drawer not closing or things being lopsided (as some reviewers had said). It might have to do with making sure you follow the directions really well. I should point out - getting the mattress holder aligned in (the black metal piece) was really difficult - needed a long of strength and force.It\u2019s very pretty looking...not sure how it will hold up (will edit this review once baby arrives and we use it). I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s durable!My only beef with this crib is that the drawer is shorter than I expected. It doesn\u2019t go all the way to the back of the crib - so in no way do you get maximum use of the space under the crib - see pictures. This was terribly disappointing and upsetting, but not much I can do about it now.Some reviewers said they had issues getting close to the crib because of the drawer or that the drawer was hard to open. I haven\u2019t had any of those issues. The drawer (although short) is easy to open with just my foot (you don\u2019t even need to bend down). You don\u2019t need a handle and my foot fits under the drawer enough that I could lean into the crib if I needed, and our crib is on carpet.",

                "reviewText": "My husband and I are expecting our first child in October, so we wanted to have a crib set up in advance. I found this crib, and despite the negative reviews I\u2019ve seen, the Graco Solano 4-in-1 has met our expectations. My husband and I put this together in about an hour. The instructions are mostly pictures, but they are easy to follow if you pay attention. The crib did not have any damage like others mentioned. Just one minor scratch that is barely noticeable and not worth fixing. We don\u2019t have an issue with the drawer on ours either, like some mentioned. Maybe it doesn\u2019t glide in and out as smooth as other drawers I\u2019ve used in my life? But if you line it up correctly when you are pushing it back in, I don\u2019t really see why there would be an issue. We knew the drawer wouldn\u2019t be huge, but to have a place to store extra sheets, it is perfect. The crib looks nice and felt sturdy when we tried shaking it after assembled. Overall, a good value for the price and we are happy with it.",
