Was a little complicated putting together instructions weren\u2019t very clear but figured most of it out without reading the instructions, also had some extra poles left not sure what they are for\u2026. But I love the setup. Only thing is a down side is that it\u2019s wrinkled wish the material was a more of good quality. Fast shipping came 6 days earlier which was a plus!",
