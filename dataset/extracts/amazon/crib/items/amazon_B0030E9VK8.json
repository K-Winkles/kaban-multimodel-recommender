                "reviewText": "Like the reviews of others I needed this crib for my grandchildren. I needed a full size crib but didn't want to take up any more space than I had to. I was specifically looking for a folding crib and decided to try it based on the reviews I read. It arrived in good condition with none of the damage others described and all parts were there. My husband and I put it together in about an hour, but I would say it's a 2-person job. It is very easy to fold up which makes for easy storage. Even so, it feels safe and sturdy when it's opened up. I also like that it has rolling casters so I can move it where I need to when I need to. The only drawback I can see is it's impossible for me to reach over the side to pick up a baby when the mattress is in the lowest position. Luckily, for now, my granddaughter can stand up to let me pick her up.",

Genius that the instructions are permanentaly on the bottom of the mattress board, we will always have them handy if needy. After assembly, we easily collapsed it and carried it upstairs. Total game changer to be able to move a full-size crib from room to room. Time will tell if it holds up well, but out of the box it feels sturdy. I also purchase the matress they recommended and am very happy with it. Fits snug, as it should, and has cozy cover.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars This crib is unsafe for children. Please read the negative reviews thoroughly.",
                "reviewText": "I wish I had read more of the negative reviews on this product before buying b/c I only read a couple which focused on the missing screws or parts (which mine also had issues with). Once I purchased and assembled this Dream on Me (DOM) crib I realized what a mistake it was. It is simply unsafe for babies and older infants or toddlers. You will not rest easy if your child or grandchild is in this crib. Please, please read on.I already have a regular crib (a Delta pretty basic model) and it has preformed well but I was looking for something that was foldable but full size. I have several grandchildren who I see every week often for naps and sleepovers plus we also have a guest room so I wanted to be able to move something more easily from room to room w/o disassembling the whole thing to fit through the door (I should have just compromised with a really good pack and play and put in a better pad!).This crib seemed reasonably priced and most of the reviews were pretty good, which I actually cannot explain except that maybe those reviewers have only experience with very sedate babies who are short and small or don't do things like ever bounce in a crib, poke a finger into an opening to see what it is, or think \"gee, I'd like to get out of this thing.\" Or maybe they aren't familiar or have forgotten how much trouble a little energetic, explorative and determined infant can get into!Here's the specifics of the safety issues with this crib:** Mattress positions and supports-- There are 2 mattress positions and the lower one is 5\" (yes 5\"!!) LESS from the top of the mattress to the top of the crib rail than my Delta. We have 2 grandchildren right now using a crib (one 20 months and one 2 1/2) and the top of the crib rail in this new Dream on Me is in between their belly buttons and chest! What???? One bounce and a little determination and leg mobility and they are on the floor, head first. Also, and this is another BIG problem, when the mattress is in the lower position, as other reviewers have noted, the 5\" long metal brackets are visible in the corners and they have long slots that are sharp on the inside edges. For the upper mattress position, there are two very small plastic blocks that hold the mattress on one side that have a little burr along the edges. When the mattress is lowered the also show halfway up. Sharp stuff in a crib...? I suppose you can try telling your 18 month old, \"Now don't put your fingers on those four pieces....\" and see what happens.**Hinges on the ends that fold the crib -- This seems like such a great idea but unfortunately it is NOT unless it's done with better quality materials (and thus more expensive). There is a slight \"give\" in the hinges on ends but this causes a BIG problem bc it opened slightly just enough to snag/pinch the skin on the end of my finger. If a child leaned on it with any weight at all I could see it pinching and holding onto their sleeper or obviously their skin! And I wasn't even pressing hard, just enough to see how much give there was once the mattress was in the crib.**The bottom mattress \"board\"-- The hardboard mattress board is mounted to the wooden frame with thin staples, all of which had come out in transit (but were still in place just not holding it) and were not even holding the thing onto the frame. The frame itself is wood, which is OK, but the support system for holding it just seems like it's insufficient.**Other overall remarks--Yes, there were some missing washers b/c the package the parts come in is ultra cheap plastic and it had fallen apart during shipping. Bc of the reviews on this issue I was careful taking the pieces out of the box so I found almost everything except for several missing washers which I replaced from my hardware/garage supplies. There were a couple scratches, too, on the rails and sides but nothing major and I would have kept the crib if it weren't for the safety issues.Again, can't stress enough how unsafe this crib is. Please read the reviews that have said that the bottom collapsed or other people who were concerned about the safety of this crib. The overall design and hinge material and also the support system, in addition to being exposed, if just not sturdy enough for a normal moving and exploring child. How did this get by the inspectors as well as Amazon's quality control people (there are people who look at these things, right?)",

Assembly is easy enough with common sense because the instructions are TERRIBLE. A couple of my bolt holes and the hole for one of the latches underneath the mattress board are not lined up completely. That took extra work. Overall I think it is well worth the purchase price. Mine has a plastic piece that looks like a latch, coming off the mattress board that extends to outside the crib rail. If anyone knows what that is or does, please advise because it does not seem to have a logical purpose.",
