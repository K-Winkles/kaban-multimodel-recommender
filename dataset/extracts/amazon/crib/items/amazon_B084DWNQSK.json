There were dents, dings, scratches, and smudges on every piece. The instructions and tools/parts came in someone else\u2019s dirty ziplock bag and were not clear at all(wondering what instructions other buyers received that had such an easy time?). We didn\u2019t bother putting it together because of the amount of damage. Do NOT waste your time hoping you\u2019ll get a new model with instructions that make any sense. You\u2019ll just end up hauling this heap of garbage off to UPS like we are having to do today.",
