The crossbar at the bottom can be adjusted to turn the crib into a rocker. The large storage basket under the cot provides plenty of space for your baby's daily necessities. The armrest on the side of the cot is removable, so you can place it next to the bed or sofa to play with your baby easily. The long straps secure the crib securely to the parent's bed.
