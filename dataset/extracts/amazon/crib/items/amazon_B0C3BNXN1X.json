                "reviewText": "Overall this crib is sturdy and cute. The only downside is the variation in color being \u201crustic\u201d white, the headboard had slight color variation to it it was not just flat even white. Was a tad difficult to put together but once together it is very sturdy and looks great in the nursery",
