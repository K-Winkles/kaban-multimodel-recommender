                "reviewText": "I love the Oeuf Sparrow crib yet couldn't bring myself to spend $800+ on a baby bed. I searched everywhere for a grey crib with a modern ascetic. I finally came across this Hudson crib and knew it was the one. My son's name happens to be Hudson making it that much more fitting. The wood is sturdy and of very good quality. The grey color is beautiful, although a little lighter than the Oeuf. The open slats on all four sides make it airy and comfortable for baby. It took us about an hour to put together and we had no problems. There are 4 different mattress height options. The crib sits low to the ground which makes it easier to get baby in and out without breaking your back. It comes with the toddler rail which is an added bonus. You have to buy it extra with the Oeuf at $200+. I am so happy that I found this crib. I would recommend it to any family.UPDATE: At 18 months my son figured out how to crawl out of the crib. I was so glad we already had the toddler rail as we had to do a quick change late one night to prevent my little guy from breaking his neck. It was beyond easy to unscrew the front panel of the crib and attach the toddler rail. It took us all of 10 minutes. It's a huge transition from the crib to toddler bed (for both baby and parents) but it was made so much easier because we could continue to use the crib he'd been sleeping in from the beginning. I am still so glad that I chose the Hudson crib over the Oeuf. It has held up very well and is in great condition after almost two years. I expect that we will continue to use it for at least another year or so.",

I helped my husband assemble it while I was 36 weeks pregnant and we got it done in less than 30 minutes. It looks really nice and modern and the height is great; I don't have to bend over too far to put baby down/pick baby up. (For reference I'm 5'5\" and crib comes to right above my bellybutton when I stand next to it.)Just a reminder: the mattress that fits this crib is NOT a standard sized mattress so you have to purchase a Babyletto mattress for it to fit perfectly. I did find that the Burt's Bees crib mattress fitted sheets fit very well.",

And just be aware it seems the finish scratches easily so be careful when moving. Other than that no complaints. It\u2019s BEAUTIFUL and seems well made.",

Easy to assemble in about 1 hour by myself while husband was at work and kids were napping. Not heavy. Downside is yh3 wood doesn't seem to be a super high quality and as you can see in the pictures, there are areas where the wood isn't sanded perfectly. Also, thr bolts are visible inside and not covered, and the mattress support spring is also visible. The spring mattress could be hidden with a crib skirt if desired, if it's your style. Overall, I'm happy with the way it looks and works so far, and I'm glad my item wasn't broken upon delivery. Put together, it seems solid. It also included the toddler rail for when you convert it into a toddler bed.",

Also a tip to get the stickers off the wood without leaving behind residue, use a heat gun/hair dryer on the stickers and they peel right off without an issue. Over all I\u2019m super happy with my purchase and I love the look of it! Now we are just waiting on baby :)",

Super easy to build, took my husband all of 45 minutes from start to finish, and he even complimented Babyletto for having such easy directions to follow. FINALLY a company that provides EASY directions!!! All put together, it looks beautiful and looks much more expensive than it was. We loved the style and look of the Oeuf Sparrow crib, but when we thought about it, the price of this Hudson crib (which also came with the toddler rail) and a very good 2 in 1 Colgate mattress was still less expensive than just the Oeuf crib. It's very sturdy, but easy enough to move if we need to. I love the fact that it came with the toddler rail; most cribs don't include that, and you end up spending the $100-200 later. This way we have the option for one day if we need the rail or if we have another baby we can just leave it as a crib. All in all, very satisfied with the quality and craftsmanship of this crib. I would recommend it to any new mom or dad!",
