                "reviewText": "My daughter started rolling around and spinning in her crib (ikea Sundivk) when she was about 4 months old. She would get her arm or leg stuck in the slats and would start crying because she couldn't get her limb out. I talked to her pediatrician at her 4-month wellness check and the doctor said that a breathable mesh crib liner would be safe to use. I was hesitant to buy this because of other ratings, but I'm glad I got it. it works perfectly!Pro:- Works. My daughter has not been able to get an arm or a leg through since I installed these even though she has pressed up against them.- Right Price. I paid around 22$ which is a little more than I think it's are worth, but still a good value.- Pediatrician Approved. MY pediatrician approved a mesh liner for MY child. (talk to your pediatrician first!)- Easy to Install. Installation was quick and easy. I velcroed one side then the other before tying the strings around the bar and top rail. Once the strings were tied, I redid the velcro so everything looked neat and secure.- Breathable. I held it to my face to make sure I could breathe through it and I can.Cons:- I tied the strings over the top of the crib to prevent the mesh liner from falling down. if you have already lowered the mattress or if your crib has higher rails, you'll have to tie the strings solely around the bars. The fabric is silky, so it may slip. You could probably prevent this if you taped the strings to the rail on the outside.- These aren't secure enough to prevent a baby from pulling them down. My baby can't grasp them for climbing yet (she scratches them, but can't pull), but once she starts using them to pull herself up, I'll have to take them out. Hopefully by then she will be able to get herself unstuck.- There are gaps on either end of the crib. These liners are for solid end cribs and because of how they attach, there is an open slat on each end of the crib on both sides (4 total open slats). My daughter has found her way to the ends of the crib, but hasn't gotten a limb out (getting an arm out would be hard, but a leg is possible). I'd like to see a liner that covers all the slats and maybe tied around the solid ends.- Cleaning. Because it is mesh, it is hard to spot clean. I don't expect the liner to get excessively dirty but my daughter has managed to drool on it already. You can take it off and scrub it if needed.Minor Cons:- Color Choice. This was the only liner I could find for a solid end crib. I have white and grey in the nursery so the grey color worked for me, but I would like to see this come in other colors.- Hard to see through. I was hoping that I could see through this liner a little more considering it is mesh. i have to peek over the top of the crib to make sure my daughter is still sleeping (I can see if she is moving but i cannot see if her eyes are open).Overall, I would recommend this product. My daughter was poking a limb through the slats a few times per day (she would start on her back for naps and then roll to her side and spin, trapping a limb in the process. I would reset her and she would do it again). This has kept her limbs safely inside the crib and helped her sleep longer because she's not waking herself up because she's caught.",

Sometimes she would get herself into painful positions. I needed something to block the rails that did not pose a risk for suffocation. The mesh is soft and allows air to pass through. These allowed my daughter to sleep peacefully. Before these we would wake up to her crying stuck in the rails. These only took about 5 minutes to install. The directions where very clear and installation was a breeze. These liners are speficically made for a crib with solid ends. The ends are Velcro and customize to fit any crib with solid ends. The fit is tight, safe, and it stays on. The look is neat and tidy.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this because my son moves around a lot at night and somehow kept getting his feet stuck in the slats of the crib. This is definitely what I needed and I'm not worried about him suffocating since it's breathable mesh.The only thing that could be better is the ties. My crib (a hand-me-down from a friend) is designed where the middle slat is really wide and the tie is too short, so it's only tied on either end. My son sometimes brings his feet up above the mesh and pushes it down (defeating the purpose), so that extra tie would be really useful.",

You really need to pull it down so the mattress holds the bottom in place.This product has given me and my husband peace of mind when sleeping. I do wish, however, that it was a couple inches taller.",

This are an amazing alternative! It velcros right to your crib spindles and prevents little arms and legs from getting stuck durring sleep. The fabric is total breathable mesh (so no safety hazard) and washable! I recommend these to everyone!",
