                "reviewText": "I looked for weeks at all the reviews and comments. I put together this crib all by myself for my grand daughter. All the parts are labeled including the hardware and the directions and pictures are great! Be sure to read the stickers on each part! The stickers even tell you which side is on the inside!I got the white and dropped a screwdriver so I dinged the paint so wish I went with the grey but it\u2019s a gorgeous well built crib!Very sturdy! Love it!",
