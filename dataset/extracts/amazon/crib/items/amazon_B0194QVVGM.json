It\u2019s a great height from the ground that I know he won\u2019t hurt himself getting out. Now I read all of the reviews about set up and honestly it was not as difficult as I thought it was going to be. The instructions were good to me, it does come with an Allen wrench. The instructions said you may need a hammer or screw driver also but I did not. It was time consuming to do but I wanted it done right so I took my time. The quality seems great, very strudy. I would definitely recommend. Ot also does not have shape edges around the opening. I am using a Graco toddler mattress that comes in a box because I did not like the loud water proof cover that\u2019s on the the dream on me mattresses and it fits just fine. Would recommend this toddler bed.",

                "reviewText": "Good luck putting this together. You'll need small fingers to get these bolts into the slots. You'll need to do this with plenty of patience on your side and hours to dive into this. The pieces are not labeled. Only 1 piece was labeled. Same goes for the bolts and screws. The bags they came in were not labeled. Quite honestly, I had to wing it and pull up the picture from Amazon for reference to how it's supposed to look.FYI the pieces needed for the table ARE NOT INCLUDED!The bed is extremely low to the floor which I guess is fine for being a toddler bed easier for them to get into and out of, but it just looks extremely small. If used as chairs and a table, that's where I'd leave a 3-4 star raiding being so low to the floor. Even for a kid it's pretty low.Overall, it does look nice but man was it a pain to put together. Even if it was a terrible quality, you have my money because I am not about to spend hours taking this thing apart \ud83d\ude02Step 1 process for putting the first chair together you also use for step 2, but in reverse. The directions do not tell you this; you just have to figure it out on your own.It's a cute bed. The price for the quality is reasonable. PUT THIS THING TOGETHER WHEN NO ONE IS HOME because your patience will be ran dry.",

I used the same crib bumper, sheets, etc. He calls it his \"big bed\" even though it's the same size.
