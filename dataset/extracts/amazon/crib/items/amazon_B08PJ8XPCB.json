I needed a mini crib big enough for my toddler but small enough to fit within the bottom bunk of a triple bunkbed since he isn't ready for sleeping on his own in the bunkbed yet. After pouring over reviews & checking the dimensions of several mini cribs, this was the only one that met our needs at a reasonable price.It shipped quickly, much faster than the estimated 3-4 weeks. It was very quick & easy to assemble with clear instructions. I appreciate the extra hardware was included in a well labled zip bag separate from the hardware needed for assembly. Once the mini crib was assembled, it felt quite sturdy. The included mattress is decent though we may upgrade to a thicker mattress in the future.Time will tell how well this mini crib holds up but so far I am very impressed.",

I\u2019m 26 weeks pregnant and I very well managed to put this together by myself, it\u2019s not heavy at all once you open it up and start putting the pieces together. The crib itself is lightweight just in case you need to move it around once it built. (I did have someone carry the Box it came in up the stairs for me). My only complain would be the mattress that comes with it. I don\u2019t love it it\u2019s very plastic-y. But it\u2019ll do until I buy a replacement mattress. Once I put the crib sheet over it it feels/ looks better but I still plant on replacing it. It just doesn\u2019t feel safe in my opinion. Other than that I love this and for the price I very much recommend it!",

Don\u2019t waste your time ordering and then returning it as I don\u2019t believe the smell is going away. It\u2019s been a few days already and it is as strong as it was on day 1. Some other reviews mentioned the smell is still there after a month. I don\u2019t understand why this product is still listed on Amazon and isn\u2019t banned.",

We left off the front railing because we are using this as a bedside sleeper but it\u2019s beautiful with the railing on as well. We love that you can adjust the height of the mattress. The white and natural wood go with our earthy nursery and it\u2019s easy to find matching furniture. The mattress is plasticity but you can\u2019t tell after you put on the sheet. It\u2019s comfortable. We have a super small apartment so this crib is small enough to not take up too much space but is big enough that our 3 year old can fit in it comfortably. Don\u2019t waste your time looking at other cribs. This is the one.",
