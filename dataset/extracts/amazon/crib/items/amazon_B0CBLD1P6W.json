I gave it 4/5 stars only because the color is darker in person. Online it\u2019s a light wood, but it\u2019s actually a medium toned neutral brown. It\u2019s still a very pretty color just not what I was expecting but we ended up keeping it because I just love the arched sides! We do highly recommend it! (Mattress not included)",

Was so excited for this one to pop up being exactly what I was looking for for such a better price. The quality is amazing. My husband was able to build it on his own very quickly. It came super fast too. I was nervous because it's new and not a lot of reviews, but it is perfect! I love going into baby's room and just looking at it. Can't wait for our little one to sleep in it.",

Way better price than 1,200 I\u2019ve seen in higher retail stores in malls. This color is darker than what is shown on the listing but it\u2019s a pretty honey color wood. Didn\u2019t smell or have a weird fume scent and was super easy to assemble! Can\u2019t wait for baby boy to sleep in here :)",
