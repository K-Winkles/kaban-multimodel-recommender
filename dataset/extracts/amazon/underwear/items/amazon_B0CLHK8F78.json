I switched to Nordstrom Brand for a while until this recent purchase. I\u2019m not sure what happened to quality control but I wish I never switched back. The material feels a lot cheaper and boxer briefs ride up your leg to such a degree that I have to take time out through out the day to straitened them out, and undershirts have a similar problem around the waist. I would have returned them all except that I tried them on, took them all out of the packaging, washed them, and waited a few months before I started to wear them regularly. I am no longer wearing them, and I can no longer recommend their products especially the ones I bought.",
