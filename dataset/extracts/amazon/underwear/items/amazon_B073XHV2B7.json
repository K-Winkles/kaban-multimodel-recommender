                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars the only panties that don't ride up on me",
                "reviewText": "Fabric is cool and comfortable.The stretch is great.I have a slim hourglass figure with a very long rise. These panties come up just to the bottom of my belly button and actually fit my waist and my hips nicely. The waistband lays perfectly flat and never folds over. Sometimes panties that go up that high while fitting my hips are baggy on my waist.For that reason I don't think I would recommend these to someone with narrow hips and a full waist because I think the waist would create a muffin top that you don't otherwise have unless you size up. Slim athletic figures like rectangles would probably be ok though.Panties almost always ride up onto my bum cheeks because I have kind of thick thighs and a flat butt so there's usually not much for that elastic to grab on to. It is what it is.But these panties don't!The way these panties fit means they don't. ever. ride. up. I love them!The reason they don't ride up is that while the hips are plenty wide, the leg opening has tighter elastic so it prevents the back from riding up. Even though the fabric is almost weightless the leg opening fits firmly - kind of like an athletic swimsuit bottom.The downside to this fit is that it creates very visible panty lines when I wear thinner fabrics so I don't wear these under my leggings for yoga or pilates, or anything satin or silk. But they are great under jeans, ponte, and other thick fabrics.Great for athletic wear - I can wear these for hiking and never have to tug on my panties because they stay in place no matter what I am doing. Usually I have to wear boy shorts to prevent ride up but I don't like boy shorts on hot days. I live in TX and want to wear as little as possible. The cool fabric breathes well.One added bonus for the ladies is that if there is any stain - like if you're out hiking on your lady days and there's a leak - the fabric doesn't hold on to stains so they wash out nicely without using harsh chemicals.I have purchased several pairs of these in black, nude, and light pink and love them all. Highly recommend!!!!",

This particular design of underwater runs a little bit bigger than their other underwear designs. I bought an XL but L would have been better. These are not seamless and the front waist band has lines that are visible through bodycon dress or any outfit that is more clingy to the body. Don't get me wrong the quality of the underwear is great, but it's not seamless. Unfortunately, I had to return it due to size issues.",
