When I first bought them about a year ago, I took them home and realized they were just a bit bigger on me (I usually wear small) but after working out my legs that fall/winter I put on some leg mass and the mediums ended up fitting perfectly (I literally had to grow into them) so when I went back to W-M to buy more they were gone, so fast forward and I found them here. I ordered a 3-pack of medium and they fit great, and they are some of the more comfortable boxer briefs I own. I really like these, and the Spyder brand. They are very light, comfortable, and breathable. I wear them under my uniform paired with 32degrees cool moisture-wicking t shirts and I feel great in this Maryland heat and humidity.",

                "reviewText": "I'm one of those men who was either blessed or cursed by being naturally well endowed, and I was always on the lookout for men's underthings that could provide more in the way of support, sort of like an athletic supporter but more mainstream, and these I am happy to report are just that. I will be the first to admit, that you are giving up something in the way of comfort (moisture-wicking and breathability) to gain more support. But that is a small price to pay for the confidence and peace of mind that comes with knowing that your shorts are going to be there for you when you need them. Not to mention, the company that made the old-fashioned jockstraps went out of business, and nobody makes 'em like that anymore.",

                "reviewText": "These short-leg boxer briefs are the perfect underwear for me! So I warn you to beware of misleading reviews! Maybe some have mixed these up with another product, or maybe the manufacturer changed the design along the way. I don't know, but I have had mine for several years, and I can tell you what's wrong in the reviews. Some are saying these briefs are like tighty-whities. Not so! These are short-legged just as advertised. That means the leg openings are horizontal when you have them on, not riding up into the creases of the crotch like regular briefs. Some are saying the material is 100% polyester. In the question-answer section, one person (who even claims to be the manufacturer) says they are 93% polyester & 7% spandex. Not so! They are 91% cotton, 5% polyester & 4% spandex just as advertised. Some are saying they have no fly that opens. Not so! And that's again wrong in the question-answer section. It has a fly and it definitely does open, but not so wide that anything will accidentally fall out. In my opinion, it's a perfect design. The only caution I have is that they might fit tighter than is typical for the size you usually wear. Part of the reason for that could be the wider band of elastic than FoTL sells, for example, in their cheaper line of briefs. I personally don't enjoy tight elastic, so I buy a larger size than is recommended for my waist. Do that and I think you will love them.",
