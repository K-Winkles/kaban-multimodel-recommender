                "reviewText": "I have been a faithful user of briefs, but now I have switched to boxer briefs due to my inquisitive purchase of these Hanes boxers. I like their comfortable fit and the breathable materials. The waistbands are wide and very flexible, affording a pleasant fit and no rolling of the band itself into the waist and pinching. So, far (after several washes), they hold their color and have very little shrinkage. Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs are top-notch in design, comfort, and usefulness. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase was the cost. I think that it is a little high for underwear, but after doing some research, I found out that the cost of underwear is going up across the board with many manufacturers. With that said, Hanes Boxer Briefs are well worth their cost.",

                "reviewText": "I'm happy with the Hanes boxer briefs 12 pack. Decent price, good fit. My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the sizing. I have a 35 inch waist, so I was undecided whether to get size Medium or Large. Large is advertised as fitting a 36 to 38 inch waist. Small is 32-34. If size Large is appropriate for someone with a 38 inch waist, it sounded like they'd be too big, so I bought size Medium locally, and they were definitely too small. You can't return underwear after the package has been opened, so I ended up paying twice to get underwear that fits. I donated the size M to a clothing drive. I'm pleased with the underwear. However, if you have a size 38 waist, I don't think you'd be happy with size Large.",

These are the second pack of boxer briefs that I've tried.I find briefs are good at holding the equipment comfortably, but restrict the air and blood flow.Boxers allow the equipment to hang free, but also allow the occasional dribble down the leg, and ride up.These boxer briefs are a great compromise incorporating the best of both worlds, whilst eliminating the worst of both worlds.They are comfortable to wear. They allow the equipment freedom to move, but the tighter leg fit prevents dribbles and don't ride up or wrap around as loose boxers do.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The material if soft and thick enough to absorb the occasional drip. They are comfortable, and don't ride up at all. The price is also pretty good.I would definitely recommend these boxer briefs.",
