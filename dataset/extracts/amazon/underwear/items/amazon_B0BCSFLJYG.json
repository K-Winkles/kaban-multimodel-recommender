I own a lot of them. I needed Blue Camo to replace a blue camo brief that I had throw away last year. The over all comfort is good. I wore mine for a full day at work and for a whole weekend that I wrote this. The spandex is just perfect that isn't so tight but a firm fitting that stay is in place with hardly any slide up stretch. There is only one way micro fiber last is to not wear it frequently wash after wash. I own underwear from Walmart Athletic works. This like 2 decades ago and there are in still the best shape because I don't wear them year around. I plan on buying 3 camo other color patterns. Jockey also makes blue camo in a 3pk trunks. I plan on making that purchase next month. The length on these boxer briefs is about 5 inches. It's sufficiant. I own all 3 lengths from Adidas and I don't have an issue. If you like spanex fitting than a loose fit this is bettee than the Adidas 4 pk design trunks that doesn't have any firm fitting.",
