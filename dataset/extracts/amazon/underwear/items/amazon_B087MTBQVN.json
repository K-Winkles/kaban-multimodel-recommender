The material is soft and comfortable, and the stretchy fabric moves with his body, providing a snug fit without feeling restrictive. They also wash well and maintain their shape after multiple washes. Overall, I would highly recommend these boxer briefs to anyone looking for comfortable and durable underwear.",

I do all my activities in these briefs (long distance running, desk job, cooking, cleaning, eating, etc.) and will probably keep buying them for the rest of my life.",

I actually first bought this a few years ago when I found them at Marshall's. I was able to find the exact variation I like on Amazon and now that's what I'll always buy when I need new boxers. They fit incredibly well, not tight at all, long enough that they don't ride up your leg, etc. I had to make sure the material percentages were exactly the same as the first pack I bought and these are. I won't necessarily use these for working out or running because I prefer compression shorts for that, but for everyday tasks, these are the best.",
