I recommend sizing down for a fit that doesn\u2019t move under clothes. By the end of the day they are so stretched out they almost fall off. The material is very thin (almost see through) and ribbed with way too much give for me. That being said they are lightweight and breathable and the variety of colors is appealing.",
