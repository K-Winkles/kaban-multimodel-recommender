Great price, pack of 9 is a great buy. They are perfectly white, so if bleach is needed in the wash, no worries. They hold up well, delivered on time, we have purchased from this supplier multiple times, no issues. Will keep using this supplier with confidence.",

I\u2019ve been a long time briefs wearer and have tried so many brands, cuts/styles, fabrics and honestly none of those compare to the fit, comfort and appeal of these classic Hanes. They\u2019re not too low or too high in the rise so they work great under jeans, shorts, gym wear, anything. The pouch is roomy but supportive and never feels constricting or too tight. The coverage in the butt is perfect and not cut too high. The true testament is that I can sleep in them. I usually can\u2019t sleep in briefs of any kind so that\u2019s when I knew these were keepers. Best of all they\u2019re a great value and made well. For reference I\u2019m 5\u20199, 30in waist, athletic build and I wear mediums.",
