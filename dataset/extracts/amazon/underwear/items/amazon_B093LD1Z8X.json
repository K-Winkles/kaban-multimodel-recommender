I'm a larger person so it's hard to find decent quality clothing big enough to fit me. To my surprise, these have got to be some of the most comfortable underwear I've ever had. I'm straight up replacing all my old ones with these now. They are also great quality, which I didn't necessarily expect for the price point and for a generic seeming brand on Amazon I've never even heard of before. The fabric is super soft and stretchy, the seams are super well done, the color doesn't bleed, the band does its job without digging in, it takes a LOT for them to get swampy and gross, and they seem sturdy enough to last a long time. Definitely better than the underwear packs I used to get at Walmart. They fit true to the size chart. I guess if you like your underwear tight you could go a size down, I personally wouldn't though. If you're on the fence, go for it!",

                "reviewText": "It's been a minute since I've been able to give something 5 stars on Amazon, but hooray we have a winner!! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\u2714I loved the cute mock \"tightie whitie\" style of these undies, like a combo between boy shorts & panties or something.I toiled overtime deciding what size to get. Currently a plus-sized beauty, I scoured the reviews, & between those & the sizing guide I did go up 2 full sizes larger than what I usually wear. I'm So Glad I ordered up. I went up the 2 sizes mostly because other reviewers mentioned the leg holes being too tight. And yes, they ARE too tight so you will wanna size up for sure IMO. Even w the 2 size jump-up I almost returned these because of the leg hole issue. Fortunately they do give a little after wearing them a bit, so crisis averted.Fyi poor blood circulation in your hips can literally cause osteoarthritis (#speakingfromexperience) so over the years all our tight panties, jeans, leggings etc can actually do a number on our blood supply in those areas so I'm extra careful about underwear pulling tight in the leg hole area & jeopardizing circulation. If I'm not mistaken it's actually where your femoral artery is located, which brings all the blood to your legs.Biology lesson aside, these underwear are well-made, well-designed, super soft & comfy, and even wash well so far. They're quite thick, actually, which make them more substantial, in a good way.They literally make me FEEL better because they cover well, are so comfortable, and not so bad to look at in the mirror, either. Pleasantly covers any unsightly lower belly (fupah) and hugs your bum in the exact right location to create proper cheek definition. \ud83d\ude04I'm hoping the price won't skyrocket before I can afford to grab another bunch of them.Like every woman knows, when something fits, get multiples!",
