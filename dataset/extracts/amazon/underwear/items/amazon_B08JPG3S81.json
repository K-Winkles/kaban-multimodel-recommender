                "reviewText": "They are they are very comfortable and wash nicely. They do shrink. Shrinkage in terms of shrinkage I'd say about 10% to 15%.They fit comfortably through the legs after washing but they ride up once washed. Yes I have a bubble butt, these underwear are actually very comfortable for a full figured woman. However, if I order these again, and I probably will because they are very comfortable, I would get one size larger for a couple of reasons they fit comfortably through the butt kind of, but not my pendulous stomach. They do cover the side area of my stomach which was important to me. The picture shows that the waistband covers the navel. But if you're built like me, that's not happening. Also the picture is slightly misleading in that the wide band is not elastic, it has a regular elastic band the wide area of the underwear is thick cotton. Believe me I would take a picture of myself in this underwear but why horrify the world.Overall I'm very pleased with this product, but I gave it four stars because it does not cover my stomach fully.",

(Amazon's search engine brings them up under the search. )What they are though, 6 pairs of really comfortable ,mostly cotton, underwear, that only cost me $15.00.I washed them, they do shrink. But for me that was a good thing. They were way to big at first. (I am now gonna have to set, of them. Just gonna buy the size down. I feel like maybe they run big?",

                "reviewText": "I bought this underwear set to wear postpartum to wear after a c-section. Following a previous c-section, all of my underwear hit right along the incision line and were very uncomfortable. These high rise panties hit higher up and were way more comfortable post surgery. The material was thick, which was appreciated to soak up a bit or hold a pad. They held up great being machine washed and dried.The waist band is a little thick and did cut in a little, which I didn\u2019t love as I prefer a softer, more seamless look. The waist fit slightly smaller than expected. Additionally, they came up higher than most of my pants and showed underwear lines, so I could really only wear them with sweats. While I would not have ordered this set normally, they were perfect for post-surgery.",
