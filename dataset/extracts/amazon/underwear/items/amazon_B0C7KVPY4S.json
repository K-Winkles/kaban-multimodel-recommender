Coverage is good and going with the multi-colour package gives you option depending on what your outfit is. For $23.99 at the time of writing, the value is exceptional and highly recommended.",

They slide over other fabrics well, don\u2019t have seams to dig into your hips, and are relatively invisible under most other fabrics. The cut was much higher waisted than I expected causing the back panel to be a lot of fabric, but they are comfortable with good coverage. If you wear low waist pants these will be higher than your belt line.",
