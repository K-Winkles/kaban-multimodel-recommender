                "reviewText": "Quality product, soft, stretch ALL GREAT!!! However, each individual panty has some kind of tape on them to keep the panty in a roll. In frustration I tried cutting it and only succeeded in cutting the panty. Even my husband tried to no avail. I finally washed the set hoping the tape on this panty would come off in the water...NO IT DIDN\"T! I finally had to throw the panty away as they had a hole in them now and tape on either side. NOT a happy camper.",

They come out wrinkle free with no shrinkage.Love that they are mostly cotton. They look/feel like cotton with only the waistband and leg openings containing elastic. Great breathability for greater comfort.They do run a little large so you may want to order a size smaller. I marked fit \"as expected\" as I ordered a smaller size after reading the reviews.",
