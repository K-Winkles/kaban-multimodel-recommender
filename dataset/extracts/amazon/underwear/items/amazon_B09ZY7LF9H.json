                "reviewText": "I am 5.3\u201d & 113 lbs. I normally wear S but ordered M after reading guidelines and reviews, as I do not like tight underwear. They arrived too big especially around the legs where there was a big gap. Since they are 80% cotton I decided to try my luck and washed and dried them in the washer and dryer to shrink them a bit, although care instructions said to hand wash them. They shrank to perfection.. I like the soft, lightweight cotton and bamboo fabric, the stretch from spandex is not too tight nor too loose, they leave no marks on my body at the end of the day yet stay perfectly in place all day. I love the full coverage in the back, they do not ride up! I do not find them high-cut, more like bikini style. I got a 10 lovely multicolor pack for a very good price. Very pleased with my purchase!",

They did. The only problem is, they do not cover my butt. I normally wear a size 10 in pants, got these in a size extra large and they do not cover my butt crack. That's the reason I bought these, that and for the cotton quality. These are not full coverage if you have a big butt. I'm very upset because I've already washed all the underwear and I'm wearing a pair right now where my butt crack is showing because the underwear don't go up all the way",
