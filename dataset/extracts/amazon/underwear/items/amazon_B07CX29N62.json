                "reviewText": "I would like to state up front that I do like these. There are just a few things a perspective buyer needs to know first.These underwear are made with a great fabric. It's like a soft cotton, double thick T-shirt material. Stitching seems nice and heavy but not at all chafing. The covered waistband is very comfortable. Now for the bad stuff. There was some loose threads in the stitching on all pairs but, after several wears and washing the stitching isn't coming loose so it's just poor finish work. The style of cut for the seat area is not for an individual with a butt. It's pretty flat back there. If you've got some junk in your trunk you better not be packing much up front or these could get a bit uncomfortable. They are advertised as having a 6\" inseam but they don't. As you can see in the picture it's 4 1/4\". 1 3/4\" on an inseam for underwear is missing a lot of inseam. These are a boxer brief but are closer to an in between hybrid. Not as loose as an actual boxer but not as snug as an actual boxer brief. I also feel it needs to be stated that in most all the reviews I read, it was stated that these run a bit small in the sizing. This is absolutely not the case. If anything they run quite a bit large for the size. If you are one whom felt these ran a bit small then you've been kidding yourself on the size you actually need.",
