I have yet to go thru menopause and got IUD to get rid of period and enjoy my transisition into old lady status. I have been looking to period panties or leakproof panties to stop buying and wearing pads. These were worth a try.The fit..I mentioned my size above I am 5'7 @250 lbs. Size 9 fit great. Leg holes were fine. The waist is not too high and I have a mommy apron. The seam in the back is a little odd and high...but there has to be some compromise you are asking alot of a pair of panties. Try it, switch the pad bulge for the high panty seam and enjoy life a little.Panties are comfy...absorbant and didn't notice any smell. But hygiene is huge with me.Happy leaking!!!",

Not even an hour after I slapped these over my buttcheeks, I had to stop at a gas station for the sole purpose of tearing them off in the bathroom. The seams were *that* unbearable, especially the arch on the booty, and even though the fit was good, I swore they were cutting off circulation to my legs, and I'm not *that* Thicc. I also made sure to pee, because I definitely didn't want to risk an accidental leak now that I was going commando in a dress- which is NOT as sexy as it sounds, especially when you are en route to a doctor's appointment, and not even the kind where not having knickers on would be a convenience!FML that it was windy as all hell today. \ud83d\ude11Thus, I give these one star. Never even wore them long enough to test their effectiveness, but a massive period pad is more comfortable. You get what you pay for, I guess.My apologies to those who witnessed my Marilyn Monroe moment in the hospital breezeway. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
