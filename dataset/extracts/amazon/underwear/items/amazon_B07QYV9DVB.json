                "reviewText": "I really like how comfortable they are and how soft they are! They stretch good and fit really well. I haven't had any shrinking issues with them either they're a bit snugger after washing but it's almost unnoticeable compared to right out of the packaging.Would definitely recommend these to anyone that like Calvin Klein style softness. These actually have a more comfortable waistband then some of the \"high end\" brands like Calvin, Tommy, Adidas, and such.Would buy again and probably will soon!Some brands don't breathe well and I sweat really bad when I sleep down there. These don't have that issue! They breath enough for me to wake up dry and warm!",
