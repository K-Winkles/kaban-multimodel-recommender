More than once, I've been in a situation where I suddenly needed to adjust, but most boxer briefs are that way. The one major drawback on these is the fly. Since I'm left-handed, I like the idea of a top-draw pouch. The problem with these is the fly is too high and I have to dig to get out what I need. The opening is also a tad too tight. As a result, I end up standing at the urinal fishing around my pants for something that should happen more naturally. Now I skip the fly and just pull down from the waistband to get what I need. TMI? Probably, but these are a very good pair of undies with a specific design flaw.",

While in uniform, at work, it is easier to get the tool out while wearing all the gear. When off work, its like the old west, quick draw of the pistol! Who needs to be digging around, unable to draw my weapon, when my suspect is deserving to be drawn down on?",

Probably the fastest response/resolve I have ever experienced on Amazon.Pros:-Never rides up your legs-Doesn't cause 'swamp butt'-Keeps your junk in placeCons-One day they might stop making this style and I will be forced to wear inferior undiesI can't recommend these enough. I started wearing these in 2009 and have not even once thought I needed a different style. These are perfect!",
