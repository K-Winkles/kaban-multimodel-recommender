The man of the house is not a spring chicken, but he's looking pretty youthful in these new boxer briefs. The tiny bit of spandex gives a good fit that doesn't sag and doesn't pinch. The cotton is high quality with a good heft and quite soft to the touch. Two thumbs up from Mr GQ.",

No loose threads found, seams are well sewn, material integrity is quality and sound. IMHO a better and more comfortable product than Hanes or Fruit of The Loom and a few others.",

They are super stretchy and not at all restrictive. The legs also stay down and don't slip up. And I love how long the legs are compared to women's underwear. I'm not sure how long they'll last. The material seems a tiny bit cheap. But overall I'm really happy.",

He says they fall down all day and they don't cradle the boys the same. No matter how high he pulls them they just slide down. Will be getting the 5 for 80 instead of 4 for 35 womp womp.I was skeptical as with anything on Amazon, but figured I'd get these for my husband to try as his current ones suck.95% cotton was the selling point on them for me as that seems nearly impossible to come by lately. They don't stretch out around the leg and the fabric is so so soft (pima cotton soft). He says the waistband isn't super tough elastic so they don't cut into him. He's a size 36 and I got him the large.My only concern is how thin they are and how they will hold up against the test of time. If they make it 6mo before starting to show signs of needing new ones I'll be pleased.Cost/wear for 5 pairs over 6mo = 30c",
