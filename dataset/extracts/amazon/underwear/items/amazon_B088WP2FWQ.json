                "reviewText": "While I am usually content with many other cheaper brands, the 2 largest frustrations are the moisture wicking and the durability of the boxer brief. I am pretty active with a decent amount of cardio, so the average boxer brief usually holds the sweat and tears in 6 months from the friction during activity, forcing me to repurchase boxer briefs pretty frequently. All that is until now, where I found the BAMBOO COOL. This material is Bamboo Viscose, which has a natural soft and comfortable feel and does an excellent job of wicking moisture. The quality can easily be felt the first time, so the durability should really be excellent. This was a great find.",

                "reviewText": "Had goal of finding new boxer briefs, thinking cotton or other natural blend for everyday use, to complement the synthetic travel/athletic boxer briefs that I have been very happy with: Saxx Sport Mesh Boxer Brief and the ExOfficio 6\u201d Give-N-Go Sport 2.0 Boxer Brief.All of options I tried were size Medium. All of them fit well in the leg, leg opening, back/butt, waist. All of them had fabric that felt great. All of them looked great and appeared to be well made. So what it came down to was the pouch or hammock, meaning the ability to keep the dangling pair off of the leg (otherwise I would have ordered boxers instead of boxer briefs). And there were some big differences.Tried the following (in this order):Nike Men\u2019s Everyday Cotton Stretch Boxer Briefs: Pouch gets a D. These often needed adjustments. I won\u2019t be keeping these.BAMBOO COOL Men\u2019s Underwear boxer briefs Soft Comfortable Bamboo Viscose Underwear Trunks. Pouch gets a B. These felt great, but did occasionally warrant some adjustment. Otherwise excellent, I\u2019ll keep these.Saxx Non-Stop Stretch Cotton Boxer Brief: Pouch gets an F. Although my prior experience with Saxx products has been great, and although these say non-stop stretch, the stretch definitely stops in the pouch area. I was constantly aware of these pressing in on me, and eagerly awaited the opportunity to get out of them.Saxx DropTemp Cooling Cotton: Pouch gets a B. Still sometimes more grippy than I find comfortable, but not bad. Overall, I\u2019d rather have to make the adjustments with the BAMBOO COOL than feel the tightness of the Saax DropTemp Cooling Cotton.DAVID ARCHY Men\u2019s Underwear Soft Cotton-Modal Blend Boxer Briefs with Fly Boxer Shorts: Pouch gets an A-. These are basically perfect. The only thing is that the fly is horizontal instead of the classic vertical. I didn\u2019t find that to be good or bad, but note that the classic fly has 2 layers of fabric between you and the outside world, while the horizontal design has only one layer between you and the outside world. Really liked these, and wanted to try this brand with a traditional fly, so ordered two other styles.DAVID ARCHY Men\u2019s Underwear Ultra Soft Micro Modal Moisture-Wicking Boxer Briefs with Fly for men: Pouch gets A. Happy to wear these.DAVID ARCHY Men\u2019s Boxer Briefs, Bamboo Mens Underwear, Boxer Briefs for Men with Fly: Pouch gets A. Can\u2019t be better.",
