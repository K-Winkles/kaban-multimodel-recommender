I\u2019m older and haven\u2019t worn hipsters or bikini underwear recently. I decided to try them out under my workout pants and I realized that they\u2019re super comfortable and that they stay put. I like them so much I decided to buy more. I couldn\u2019t find them in my size at the store, so I checked online and found them on Amazon. I\u2019ve since been wearing them as an everyday panty. They wash and dry well and they don\u2019t show a VPL. For the price you can\u2019t beat them. For reference I am 5\u20198, 128 lbs with slimmer hips. I wear these panties in a size small.",

However, after less than a month, three of the five pairs, hardly stay up. The elastic/stretch around the waist has no sustainability. I wouldn\u2019t buy them again. If my return window wasn\u2019t closed, they would all be going back.",
