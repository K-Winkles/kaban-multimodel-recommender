Dickies brand clothing are usually very sturdy but when I got my son\u2019s order of course we wash before first use especially there was a weird smell which I thought maybe it\u2019s because it is \u201cnee\u201d. So I washed it just like how I would wash any on my son\u2019s boxers. When the washer was done and I started taking out the clothes, I noticed there was THREAD everywhere. I was like \u201cwhere is this coming from???\u201d It came from the Dickies boxers!!!! I am soooo disappointed and would really want a refund but I already washed them and I don\u2019t even know if I want to waste my time starting the return. So disappointing.

                "reviewText": "I have had a checkered history with boxer briefs. I work in an industrial setting that requires quite a bit of walking, and my underwear has rarely stood up to the task, wearing out in the crotch and waist. It\u2019s understandable. The waist legitimately fell off of one pair after the first wash and wear. I\u2019m afraid to wear another pair for fear of spending another day at work with my boxers coming undone in my pants. I expected so much more from Dickies, of all manufacturers. They\u2019re a workwear brand, right? C\u2019mon guys, do better for working people.",
