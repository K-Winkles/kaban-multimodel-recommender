                "reviewText": "This was an impulse purchase when I became pregnant for the first time and started gaining weight that I was not used to having.I used to wear thongs as they were the best no show underwear, and being skinny I had very little irritation with the \u201cwedgie\u201d situation.After gaining some weight and not being able to handle the feeling of my old underwear, these were an effort to be more comfortable.And omg I\u2019m so glad I got these. They are comfortable and stretchy, even through gaining weight and ordering my initial size (small-extra small) I was able to wear these comfortably throughout my entire pregnancy even after gaining almost 80 pounds and jumping up a few pant sizes.Downside would be having to hang dry these versus throwing them in the dryer with everything else.I can tell the difference immediately, the ones exclusively hand dried have lasted amazingly, and I can easily tell which ones accidentally got snuck into the dryer. All still have held up well, but the dryer ones look older than the hang dried ones.I enjoyed how many came in this pack and they\u2019ve lasted me over a year thus far and I\u2019ve been contemplating ordering more just to have extras.I will admit that while they are mostly seamless, it will depend on how tight your clothing is and if you are able to smooth them out under the fabric. Tighter clothes will challenge the seamless factor, but again subject to the tightness and the fabric of what you\u2019re wearing.",

I just can't get behind a full brief because I can't handle the panty lines, so a cheeky seemed the way to go. The ROSYCORAL Women\u2019s Seamless Bikini Panties are perfect. They don't go so far up your butt that they irritate sensitive areas, and they don't leave panty lines. The V shape of the front is really flattering. The seams are flat and don't leave marks. You feel like you barely have any panties on! They have a soft gusset in the crotch for more thickness there. I will say, a panty liner sticks like super glue, not going anywhere. I've been hanging them up to dry to extend the life, and they dry very quickly so you could hand wash as well. Such a great deal for some great undies. I am 5'7\" and 155 pounds, a little hippy but with a little bit of a flat butt. The medium fits me perfectly.",

No seems means no bottom ends on the legs they are cut a bit higher than I imagined, and I was uncomfortable about the cut. ( although my assets or the first part of that word my just be extra large). Once I put my pants on I fell in love. I feel as if I am wearing nothing. Soft as a glove. Light as a feather perfection in every way.Easily the most comfortable underthings I have worn. 10 out of five stars!",
