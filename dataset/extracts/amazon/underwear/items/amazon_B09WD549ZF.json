                "reviewText": "If you have incontinence or travel frequently these are the perfect panties for you! The panties are quite thin, so soft & durable. Making it easy to handwash & dry very quickly. So easy that was able to completely clean a slight bladder leak with only a baby wipe while in an ER bathroom. As I deal with incontinence my panties get a lot of wear & are often washed & dried. The waistband & panties are a single piece of fabric so you'll never worry about the waistband detaching at the seam. After several months of heavy use, they're as soft & unblemished as they were when I purchased them. They're perfect for traveling as they take up so little space, easily folding or rolling. These are my 2nd order as I consider them the perfect panties. I'll probably purchase a third & 4th pack to make sure I'll always have them even if they're discontinued one day.",

                "reviewText": "They're so soft and comfortable. I've been having trouble finding underwear that fits through online shopping, and am too socially awkward to go to a store and spend hours picking some out (classic indecisive me.)The quality and material of these underwear are durable and soft as soft can be. It doesn't leave any marks on my body, but also isn't loose in the slightest. Its a perfect fit and very breathable. You might even have a slight panic attack when you think you forget to put anything on at all.I will say that the colors are nothing alike to those in the product images. They're supposed to be faded pastels, but the actual colors you get are very bright. The pink is literally a vibrant magenta that looks nothing like any of the ones in the picture. I don't really mind since it's not like I'm going to be seeing them all the time anyway, but it is false advertising that might ultimately disappoint buyers.",

It does give a pleasant odor once you get all the underwear bikinis out of the box but it\u2019s a nice scent to it. ( You probably need to wear them a few times to get the smell off if you don\u2019t.) Currently, it doesn\u2019t have any tears or rips when I wore a few undies a couple of times in the past few months. Great undies to have in your underwear drawer!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Fit with Soft & Flexible Material",
                "reviewText": "I would give this product 5 stars and highly recommend it for the following reasons. I purchased the 6 pack - cotton modal blend.1) Fit (size 6): I'm 5'3\", 127lbs, waist 27\", hips 38.5\" - athletic build. Each panty was the exact same size and they all fit true to size to my body. Sometimes I wear size 5 in underwear - these size charts are useful and accurate which helped me pick the size. I recommend getting a measure tape and using that for measuring your body so you can use the size charts instead of the size numbers.2) Comfort: I was looking for a mid-rise bikini panty. I like bikini cut because the side leg area meets the top of the band at a higher point on my leg. I move around a lot, sit cross legged on chairs, etc so I look for higher cut panties providing more flexibility and reducing friction around my hip flexor area. These panties sit about 1.5 inches below my belly button (true mid-rise). The tagless product feature is a life changer.3) Material (Size 6; package of 6): The material breakdown of this package size is 62% Modal / 33% poly / 5% spandex. I like the modal cotton (it's softer than other blends) and panty liners stick to the panty well. The material is somewhat thin and I can see through a few of the colors through the back bottom area. This doesn't bother me, but I wonder who these will wear over time.4) Color (Size 6; package of 6): This particular package comes with a high concentration of pinks and are true to the picture for this package size.5) Use: I use this type of panty for hanging out around the house and sleeping. I cannot give feedback on whether panty lines show through spandex or pants! Sorry!Overall, if you are looking for a comfortable panty that is bikini mid-rise and a very reasonable price, I recommend purchasing these! I'm a huge fan now and I will probably order a larger package size to diversify the colors I have in my collection. Good luck!",

The bikinis in the 10 pack are entirely different from those in the 6 pack. Fabric is different, not as soft. The sewing and how the panties are made is entirely different; the waistband and leg holes are not finished in the same way. They are more binding. Really wanted more like the original 6 I bought. Very disappointed, especially in a name brand like Fruit of the Loom. Poor quality control.",
