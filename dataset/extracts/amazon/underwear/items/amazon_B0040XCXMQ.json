I had my old standbys that come in a multipack that I would just keep rebuying when they inevitably break down and get holes or fray. They were mostly comfortable at first, but would lose shape or elasticity after some washes. I just dealt with it.Enter these underwear - these changed my undergarment life! They are SO comfortable - they fit just exactly how I want them to. They are snug without being tight. The seams around your legs do not dig in like a lot of underwear do. The waist flexes when needed, but stays put. They are the perfect cut for me, with tons of color options. They stay in place ALL DAY without shifting around at all. They wash well and never lose shape, fade, snag, or pill. These are WELL worth the money... miracle undies!!",

I bet those dears are 15 years old. I love this style. It fits snuggly, which I like because it holds my tummy in a little. I usually wear a small in clothing, but I order medium in these. They are still snug. They say they are full cut, but they do fall slightly below the waist. They are very comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "As a HUGE fan of the Wacoal B Fitting line (bikinis, things and high waist briefs), I was hoping these would be a good substitute after my beloved cotton panties were discontinued. But no. They are not.I ordered both the brief and the high leg brief to compare. I gave birth about three months ago and am softer than usual, especially in the belly. My waist is 88cm and hips are 105cm at the moment. I am 172cm tall and 73kg. I ordered a medium, hoping to wear them once the extra weight has been shed. I find them snug and unflattering.The waistband is a proper waistband. I am used to underwear with no constricting bands (lululemon mulabandha for example, or madewell seamless). This is asking for muffin top. I also find the legs dig in creating bulges. I'm a soft lady right now, but I've never had my underwear do this. I look so doughy. Also, the heathered grey is not nice. It's like a black space dye.Let me add that it's not uncomfortable. Nothing feels bad about the panties. They just look bad, in my opinion. The high cut version is super unflattering, but even the brief is a higher cut leg than I'd imagined. Also, the rise is awkward, either resting in the fattest part of my belly, an inch or so under my belly button, or giving me a wedgie in the back if I pull them up higher.I guess I'm just the gal who doesn't like these as much as everyone else. I think they'll be visible under most clothes, I feel them on my body, and I don't feel confident walking around in them in my house. I wish the B Fitting were still around. They were perfection.",

I will also try some of their other styles and their bras. Only wish Amazon would sell all their products and carry the great colours they have. I refuse to buy them through a third party and pay for shipping.",
