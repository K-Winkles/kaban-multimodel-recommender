The colored accents are great. The front is perfect amount of loose so you don\u2019t tighten the crotch, but the legs and waist bands are fantastic. Makes taking pants on and off so easy, doesn\u2019t bunch up. It absorbs sweat for heavy working and doesn\u2019t chaff at all. And to be honest I wore a pair for a couple days and it didn\u2019t even smell a little. These are the best underwear I\u2019ve ever bought and the look sick too.",

My husband loves the silky cotton feel of these. I order the first pack in October and when asked what kind he wanted he's said these again for February. They seam to be holding up for him as he likes to squat while working on his projects.around the house. And since they resemble shorts he lounges in them too with a tshirt for comfort.",

No unravelling of seams and the cuffs on the legs don't roll or ride up. The waistband is fits higher in the back so there's no plumber butt when he bends over; and it doesn't fold or twist and is still good and stretchy after many many washes.. He did say that as the kitchen is always quite hot, the underwear does get a little warm.",

They fit just a little snugly in the thigh on me but that is probably because I have big thighs and am in a bit of denial as to my getting a bit bigger as I am getting older. They are very comfortable in the shape and form fitting nature of the design and also the soft feel of the materiel. I have ordered another set for myself and will give my first order to my son (who has no need of being in denial).",
