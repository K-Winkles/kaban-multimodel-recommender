Many years ago there was a version with what was called a \u201ccomfort waistband\u201d where there was no exposed elastic. I really preferred those, but they have not been available for quite some time. The only thing I will add is that I\u2019ve always worn the size 6, and they now seem to run a bit smaller. I know it\u2019s the underpants that have gotten smaller, because I have lost 10+ lbs over the years, but the durable quality has not changed.",

                "reviewText": "I've purchased a number of Hanes products over the years and still have quite a few in my possession. As I purchased the same size I'm still wearing, I thought nothing of just opening and throwing these in the wash. Yikes! Not only were they about 2 sizes too small, while labeled briefs, they fit more like high-cut bikini. Since they've been washed, I can't return. Went directly into a donation box. A disappointing purchase which makes me wary to buy this brand again.",
