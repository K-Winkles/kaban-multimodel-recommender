He can spend ten seconds in a car seat and tell you he wouldn't buy that car because it's uncomfortable, whereas a normal person would have to ride a couple of miles at least before they'd notice. He shopped and shopped and came back to these old reliables. I just have to say that this is at least the third set he's had over the years that have the exact same plaid fabrics. I'm sick of seeing them over and over again in the laundry and can't imagine the boredom of people in factories that make them. Seriously, how hard would it be to come up with different prints or plaids every few months? But they fit him right and they're comfortable and they last a long time. So here we are. He will want the same ones again someday, no doubt, and there's something to be said for being able to recognize them when shopping.",
