                "reviewText": "These are the best panties ever but they are extremely hard to find in the string bikini style. PLEASE JOCKEY MAKE THESE AVAILABLE EVERY WHERE YOU SELL YOUR UNDERWEAR! I've been wearing this style underwear for years & turned my sister onto them. Because they are hard to find & when I do buy them I need to stick up, I end up spending a small fortune because they are quite expensive through amazon. I keep trying to find a cheaper alternative, but there are not a lot of underwear with the 'string' type sides and nothing holds a candle to how comfortable these are. The ones with the larger coverage on the sides are just as comfortable, but I just love the way the string style fits and looks. The one negative thing about these is that they tend to pill up very quickly. I don't know if the modal textile has something to do with it, so they look pretty beat up quickly, but they are just the best underwear I don't care how they look. I've got other panties to wear when I want to get my sexy on, which are extremely comfortable as well but not something you want to wear all the time. The Jockeys are the ones that will be your HG, go to, every day panty. They are great to work out in (even for the most intense workouts) as they hold their place really well, no wedgies. They are comfortable to sleep & lounge In and wear for almost anything at any time. I've lost a lot of weight & my some of my love handles, from when I first started buying these but I still go for the larger sizes, usually 7 or 8 (I can't remember what sizes they offer ATM) even though I'm at about 110 lbs., 5'2\" tall & wear a size 4. Buy just one pair you won't regret it! HTH.",
