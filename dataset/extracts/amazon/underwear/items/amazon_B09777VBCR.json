                "reviewText": "I have one other pair of Saxx boxer briefs (Quest) which fit well and when I saw the sport mesh boxer for a reasonable price I decided to give them a try. The fabric is very light and has plenty of stretch. The pouch keeps your balls in place as advertised. These are slightly snugger across the hips than the other pair I have but it does provide slightly more lift and support for your balls without being uncomfortably tight. I've worn them to the gym a couple of times and am happy with them. The waist fits slightly lower than the other pair I have but they don't feel like they are sliding down while being worn. The legs do tend to ride up a bit more, but they don't seem to bunch or create creases in the groin that are uncomfortable. Overall I'm happy with them.",

                "reviewText": "my underwear journey..... i bought some basic inexpensive undies from walmart and it felt as if i was just going commando, very very displeased and i ended up donated that pack of 6 into the donation box. sure when i was younger i would not care, but now i am older and support matters. i haul mail and have to get in and out of the truck a lot and realized that the right underwear can really provide comfort all day long. this pair of saxx seems ok as far as support goes. as some mentioned it does fit rather tight and i have never worn speedos before but i am guessing this probably has a similar tight feeling and i got a medium. some mentioned that the back of the underwear falls down and while i will half agree that they probably bought the wrong size, i will say that the front seems to pull up higher than the back. not sure if that is by design or not, but it did not bother me. the material is nice and comfy. now the reason why this underwear is not for me is because it squeezes the scrotum in really tight and because i get in and out of the seat and walk around a lot things get pushed down and when i get back into the seat it feels like everything is crammed down and i have to reach inside and down to pull things up so i can sit comfortably. yes it does prevent things from moving left and right but as far as doing the things that matter, there are other brands that are more cost effective and do just as well. i will still use it, until i find the one with the support i really need, but i will not buy this model again.",

My partner said it was like a comfy hammock keeping him in place. And they were the best fitting undies he has tried. Although a little on the pricier side, these seem like good quality and have the \u201chammock\u201d that other undies don\u2019t have. I will definitely be buying more of these for my guy.
