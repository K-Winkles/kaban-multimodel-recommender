                "reviewText": "These are the only kind of BBDs my husband has worn in 30 years of marriage. I used to be able to depend on this brand for good quality, comfortable, durable undies. The last two orders of these were poorly stitched, thin material, had rolling waistbands, and lost elasticity within a few washes. Calvin Klein needs to do quality control at the manufacturer. The brand is being damaged by poor quality materials and manufacturing.",
