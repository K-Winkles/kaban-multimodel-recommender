To be real, these aren't the BEST quality ever, but they will certainly do. They are kind of a thin material with not a lot of elastic. I prefer Hanes typically, but again 10 pairs for $16 bux is cool, I just wish they had more elastic. They are lightweight and true to size as far as what your normal size is. I'm not sure about the size chart per say but I wanted some that were a little more snug than the size 12's I got some months ago.",
