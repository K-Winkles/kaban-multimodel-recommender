                "reviewText": "Levi's, a brand renowned for its commitment to quality and style, extends its excellence to the realm of men's underwear with the Levi's Men's Boxer Briefs 4 Pack. These boxer briefs have truly won me over with their incredible comfort, stylish design, and unbeatable value. Here's why I can't help but sing their praises:Comfort and Fit (5/5): The moment you slip into a pair of Levi's boxer briefs, you'll understand what true comfort feels like. The breathable stretch fabric ensures a snug yet non-restrictive fit, offering ample support where it's needed most. These boxer briefs stay in place throughout the day, eliminating the need for constant adjustments.Durability (5/5): Levi's reputation for quality extends to its underwear as well. These boxer briefs are built to last. Even after numerous washes and frequent wear, they maintain their shape, elasticity, and color. It's a testament to the brand's commitment to providing long-lasting products.Stylish Design (5/5): Levi's knows that style matters even in the most personal aspects of your wardrobe. The classic Levi's logo waistband adds a touch of sophistication, making these boxer briefs feel like more than just underwear. It's a subtle yet striking detail that sets them apart.Breathability (5/5): The breathable fabric ensures that you stay comfortable all day long, even in warmer weather. These boxer briefs wick away moisture and allow your skin to breathe, preventing discomfort and ensuring you remain cool and dry.Value (5/5): The 4-pack is a fantastic deal. You get four high-quality boxer briefs at a price that's tough to beat, making Levi's underwear an excellent investment. Plus, the fact that they are built to last means you won't need to replenish your underwear drawer frequently.Overall Impression: Levi's Men's Boxer Briefs are a testament to the brand's commitment to quality, comfort, and style. These boxer briefs offer unbeatable comfort, style, and durability. Whether you're a long-time fan of Levi's or new to the brand, these boxer briefs are an exceptional addition to your wardrobe.

                "reviewText": "I must admit I've been a bit shocked at the prices of boxer briefs as of lately! I just can't bring myself to pay $40 for a pack of 6! I bought these for the hubby to try out not expecting much for quality or comfort due to the price. I was a bit shocked that Levi had a semi-reasonable set! The hubby loves them and asked for more. These aren't scratchy like some of the other big name multi-pack options. They have been washed a couple of times and the elastic and softness hasn't been impacted at all. Good work Levi!",

                "reviewText": "For a long time I was a big fan of the nautica boxer briefs. Due to the lack in consistency and craftsmanship of their product I realized it was time to move on. I decide to try a new brand for me. These seemed perfect. Description stating 95% cotton and 5% spandex, I was right where I left off with nautica. Although I always wear size medium, Amazon made it their business to tell me that I wanted to buy a large. Against my gut I went with the large, and I applaud for Amazon pointing that out to me. Everything was wonderful until I finally received the package. I whipped out a fresh pair and was planned to be blown away and ready to order 50 more pairs. To my disappointment the first pair I put on seemed ridiculously large for me. I figured I\u2019d hopefully fit into them after a wash. I kept them in hoping that they were really my size. I really wanted the hunt for good underwear to be over. I paused after my next change to go back to my old pairs. Two pairs later I had no choice to but try again as I have quite the shortage. I pulled out the next pair and to my surprise they were pretty much the boxer briefs I\u2019ve been looking for, all this time. They fit just right, and I chalked it up that the first pair was a design so maybe they\u2019re a bigger fit (which was ok because 3 out of 4 is good enough for me. Now for the kicker I was due for another change and was quite excited to have a nice fresh new pair. Sure enough out of the shower and on with the third pair (no design). Now either I just lost tons of weight in The shower or these underwear were just plain old too freakn big for me and I\u2019m just not a large. To rest my suspicions I piled up the pack only to discover that they were indeed different sizes. Not different enough to change the label, but different enough to warrant a good fit pair and a bad fit pair. And now for the kicker. I decided to read the label to see if maybe they have me 2 different sizes in the package. Low and behold they were marked large in all the pairs, my only issue was the fact that they are 53% Cotton and 47% Polyester. Completely unimpressed at this point, I\u2019m returning the 2 packages of large and canceling my order of the medium and it seems I am back on the hunt for a new brand.",
