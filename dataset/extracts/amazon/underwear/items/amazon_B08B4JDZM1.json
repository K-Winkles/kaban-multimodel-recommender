It is tough to find a panty that sits comfortably right beneath the belly button without being too tight or too loose. Especially without extenuating my belly. The mid rise or modern brief or high rise hipster is as close as I have found. These are slightly low rise for my comfort as they felt like they were slipping constantly. The fabric is super soft and lace trim flattering and stretched nicely. Even, after tugging a bit at them on day two I have not had any tears from the seams. They shrunk terribly even after I washed on cold and dried on low. What a shame. I would recommend buying a size up if you intend on machine drying them. Also, I really do not recommend if you have even the slightest belly.",

I went on treadmill with them on and when I went to shower afterward found a HUGE tear in the right side to the right bun. Unbelievable! I\u2019m super disappointed and concerned the others could tear from what exactly? Was it there when I put them on but did not notice? Now I have to return them - what a drag, I wanted to love them they are sporty/sexy and I\u2019m going to give them a pass on the rip unless it happens again than I\u2019ll have to give 2 stars. If they are good to go after a few months I\u2019ll up it to 4 stars.",
