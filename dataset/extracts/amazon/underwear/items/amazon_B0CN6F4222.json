I practically forgot I was wearing them, which is a major win in my book. Plus, the double-layer cotton lining is breathable and keeps everything feeling fresh.The seamless design totally lives up to its hype. No panty lines under, even when wearing a dress or leggings. The super thin waistband and hems stay hidden, giving you a sleek, no-show silhouette.Okay, let's talk about the cheeky cut. It's definitely fun, offering just enough coverage to feel confident. It's perfect for everyday wear.Overall, incredibly comfortable, invisible under clothes, and offer a touch of cheeky fun. For the price and comfort, they're definitely a great buy.",

They are seamless as described. It looks like they use an adhesive to hold the sides together and to attach the white cotton insert. Then they add a few stiches for strength. I just wonder how well the adhesive will hold up over time. But they are certainly soft and smooth.",

The fabric is extremely soft and smooth, and fortunately, they did not ride up my bum like cheeky undies can sometimes do! I also love how I did not get panty lines in these. They are high cut. For sizing, I went with a medium, which is what I normally wear in underwear. Highly recommend!",
