Some people look at me as I ride by, but I don't care. I'm going to replace my bathing suit with this. I bought this one and another design which look the most like bathing suits (Navy Constellations and Brushed Aqua). In the US I tend to go to the edges of the beaches where there's less people. But I can't wait to wear these proudly on Croatian beaches, where a speedo-style is more than enough. I bought these along with the jockey bikini thong and I'm returning the thong---not as comfy for me. I normally wear a large in jockey boxers and I bought the extra large in this bikini style... And XL fits great.",
