No biggie, but not what I was expecting.Secondly, one had a huge hole in the band, right out of the packaging so I had to throw that pair away, not super happy about that.The two pair left over aren't bad. They're very absorbent. But the back seam is very low and if you have a booty, I don't see it making it up to the top of your crack, which could lead to overnight leaking. For us no-booty girls though, not too bad. However that low seam isn't comfortable at all. Ans rhe top band is kind of tight and putting pressure on my stomach makes it hurt worse than it already does during my cycle sooo, not great.3/5. I wouldn't recommend.",

                "reviewText": "So I bought the Hanes for toddlers in this style for newly potty trained kids and thought ya know what I bet the period panties I\u2019ve seen promoted feel the same as this material. My relative is nearly 70 and she does have some leaks sometimes and she also feels cold there sometimes in winter and it causes an even weaker bladder. So I wanted to get these to let her try them , just having that extra layer would be better than thin panties that sitting on cold chairs or walking in cold weather and you get a breeze would help. So she tried them and is sooooo happy. As all women who have had babies naturally can tell you, a cough or sneeze can have a surprise leak and that\u2019s not ok in public with no way to change a pair of pants. These are perfect for those situations and the bonus of more warmth in winter for those with sensitive areas. Sometimes childbirth alone can cause lifelong damage and any extreme cold can cause pain when walking outdoors and especially sitting on cold benches and chairs waiting for appointments and busses etc I\u2019m 37 and have felt that pain so how about 70 years old? Amazing product !",

After cold water washing I dried them on a rack overnight. I needed them for slight incontinence and they work! I wear a thin panty liner with them at work. I recommend these!",

I wanted to write this review to warn others that the sizing is way off, the size they suggested for me was easy 2 sizes too large. Unfortunately, until I put them on I didn\u2019t know that. They have plenty of stretch as well. I wish they had some support, but they do help with leaks which is their intent. I would buy again, but definitely 2 sizes smaller.",
