                "reviewText": "Edit: I received a size small. I never wear a size small. However these fit and work perfectly now. I suggest that if you have a smaller butt to size down.These are super soft and seamless. However 5 minutes into wearing them and they've fallen off my butt! I was on a walk with my kids and having to pull them up every 10 minutes (which I'm sure didn't look great to the people in the neighborhood) I don't know if it's because I don't have much of a butt. I really wanted to love them as they are incredibly soft! I'm not sure if sizing down would help. I ordered a medium, the same size I've worn for many years.",
