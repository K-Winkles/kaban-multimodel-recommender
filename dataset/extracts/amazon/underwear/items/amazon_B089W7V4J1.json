In the last 5, I switched to higher waisted undies when I discovered they were just more comfortable than the bikinis and hipsters that I've worn for forever.I recently bought a pack of these at Walmart when I was in the US. I wanted some that would be good for my trip to Cyprus when I got back home to Germany. Something breathable for hot weather and that would dry fast. I wanted to pack just 3 pairs of undies instead of my usual 5-7 for a 2 week trip. I wore a pair each day and washed them out and they would dry overnight. Cotton doesn't always dry quickly.I loved them! I figured I would like them, but I just wore them over and over and ignored my regular cotton undies. I ordered another pair all the way from the US. I didn't want to take any chances trying another brand or another fit. I am about to order another pack, so I'll have 9 pairs, more than enough for a week.But for traveling? Just pack 3. They wash easy in the sink and dry super fast. Save that suitcase space for souvenirs.",
