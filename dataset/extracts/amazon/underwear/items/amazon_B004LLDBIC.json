                "reviewText": "I ordered the sporty version over a month ago; just one pack since there was such a mix of reviews. When they arrived \u2014 \u201csporty\u201d was definitely on the package \u2014 they looked of good quality (fabric wasn\u2019t thin; fabric was soft; waistband thick like I like) so I washed them to use. And they were great! So I got onto my Amazon account and hit the \u201cbuy again\u201d button. Yikes! I received the \u201cbikini\u201d style underwear; thin fabric, which from experience was not going to be soft and comfortable. I sent it back immediately for a refund. A month later, I searched the Amazon for the sporty style and ordered again (fulfilled by Amazon). That pack arrived today and it\u2019s definitely not the sporty variety, just the hipster variety. The material was a bit thin compared to the nice sporty variety I got and there are side seams that could potentially leave marks after a day of wearing these, but at this point I am just tired of trying, so I\u2019m keeping them (knowing they will not last as long or be anywhere near as comfortable). So rest assured, 5 stars for the sporty style that has soft fabric and no side seams. If only Amazon could actually send the right product. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s causing the mixed reviews. People are not getting sporty style they\u2019re ordering, but some other styles that are of less quality. Though I do also agree with others when they say that the quality of Hanes has gone down quite a bit. I have found it very difficult to find good ones even in store, which is why I tried Amazon and, well, I got what I wanted one out of three tries. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
