So we ordered another size small set, but during use she noticed these were significantly smaller. It wasn't one pair; the entire second set was significantly smaller than the original size small, so much so that she could easily pick them out from the original set. So we returned them, ordered another set, same problem. Finally we bought a medium which fits like the original small we ordered. Did they mislabel a medium? We may never know.",

They fit snug and I probably could've gone up a size, but mine are perfect. They fall just below my incision so no aggravation. I will absolutely buy again.I bought the large going from 209 pre-op to 197 post-op.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these a couple months back and thought they were the best with the exception that they do run a size large ( ex: if you wear large-- order a medium) the first set had 1 pair which for some reason were smaller than the rest . Unfortunately when I went to reorder- I ordered from another vendor ( a tad less expensive) ; those were cut real high up from the thigh to stomach area ( like bikini style- which lacked material & support in this area). I had ordered a size smaller - which fit perfect & that further confirmed the need to order one size smaller from this current company.After several years of wearing support nylon, spandex wear- I suddenly became allergic to the nylon/spandex; subsequently beginning my search for cotton wear with the support I liked which was a task. And then... I found this wonderful product. These are made from cotton, super soft, provide overall \"great support\" ( cotton providing this great support- who knew)--never to look back on the issues of the past wear & its materials. I could just never go back and I'm sure anyone ordering these wonderful woman undies never will either.",

They are comfortable, soft do not roll down and fit to my mid stomach. All the things I was looking for. They do have a little tummy control and will help a little with having a flattering fit under clothes. They do fit true to size so keep that in mind while recovering if you need to order a size down to account for after your swelling goes down.",
