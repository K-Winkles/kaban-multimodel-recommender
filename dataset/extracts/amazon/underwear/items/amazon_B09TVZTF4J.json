                "reviewText": "I have had such a hard time finding black cotton stretch thongs lately. This one is a cotton blend; wish it was 95% cotton but it only has a little cotton in it. It has a comfortable stretchy waist band and runs true to size. I just wish it was a bit thicker material and I wish the crotch area came with a cotton lining. It doesn't have a lining. A bit pricy for what you get at $5.99; still, a much better product than most of the other cotton stretch thongs on Amazon.",
