                "reviewText": "Being that I am a modest lady, I'm not going to take a pic of myself in my undies, but believe me when I say these are great fitting panties. They are comfy, soft, gently form fitting and make all the difference when Aunt Flo is visiting.For years I've been fighting with trying to keep my sanitary napkin in place and dealing with horrible accidents. Come to find out the crazy moving around was because my panties weren't form fitting enough. I got these around that time of the month and ( after washing, of course.) I just put them on, not thinking about it. I noticed that the sanitary napkin was much more snug against my body, didn't wiggle around and that I didn't have the usual endless embarrassing accidents.I felt more confidence to get around and do things. I also noticed that the seat is wide enough to cover the under area. I don't know why other companies are making undies so narrow that they cover hardly anything, feel like they are sawing you in half and you hardly have room to stick a napkin. It makes it so hard when dealing with Aunt FLo. The crazy thing is that they think we ladies are too stupid to notice what they've done. It's one thing to have mail in the mailbox behind, but a whole different thing when you've get it in the front! These panties are wide enough to accommodate the whole with of a sanitary napkin, even those with wings. I've also noticed that napkins stick better and are easier to remove w/out leaving sticky residue or pieces. I do want to say that these do hold you in slightly, offering support of the stomach. This can help those who have back pain or stomach issues and make clothes fit a bit better. The only draw back is that the seat of the panties are a bit thick and not as breathable as I like So if you're hot natured or going through the change you might find yourself sweating down there and the material doesn't seem to dry fast. However it seems to wick the moisture away from your skin a bit.",

You do feel that, and I don't know why there are so many manufacturers doing that! And the line does show under some pairs of shorts. But they are quite soft and overall are ok. I am losing weight so I won't have them long anyway. The sizing is a bit large. Will buy ones without the drop waist in future.",

I feel like nothing sticks to them so they truly wash out.-Because they stay snug they smooth you out.-Speaking of stick. NOTHING sticks to them. Your pad will be sideways and crooked. So if you are a pad wearer - keep your favorite period underwear.The fabric makes you sweat a bit more because it isn\u2019t as breathable. Long drives not recommended no one wants to smell like unwashed butt.Overall I would definitely buy again - I replaced all of my old stuff but kept a few just in case. So I\u2019m super happy with my decision.Sorry no pics of my undies in action.",
