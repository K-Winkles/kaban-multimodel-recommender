Made an effort to loose some weight over last 2-3 years and as an unexpected consequence I found myself having to try a fair number of different brands and types of underwear to get something that wasn't pretty annoying in some way or another. Darn if good old FTL tidy whiteys didn't end up being the best type I've had in ages. Thank you F. T. L. Please do not change these!",
