You had to worry about the chemicals in the Spandex to rough itchy waist bands, to not staying in the pouch. These Comfneat boxer briefs are very comfortable and I don't even notice the waistbands, and I stay in the pouch. I had bought 1 set of briefs a couple of months ago and I just bought 1 more set fearing that Amazon would not carry them anymore. Hopefully they last since the material does seem thin compared to other cotton briefs.",
