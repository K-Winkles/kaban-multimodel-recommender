                "reviewText": "I am making this review because I think a lot of the one star reviews are unfair. It's a two dollar pair of underwear, not twenty. Be reasonable with your expectations and like me you will be happy. Been wearing them a few days. So far no holes or seam ripping but I expect it. These are not that shiny slick material a lot of cheap underwear has. I use pads for my feminine hygiene and pads like to curl and not stick to that material. With these however, no complications. They fit me good and feel good. I am five'three and a hundred eighty six pounds. I got size extra large and they fit great, little to no roll up or sagging. If that changes I will update. I often get medium or large underwear because I rather deal with tightness at first then lose ess after they were out and stretch, but looking at reviews and filling a hunch I went with that size and am so far satisfied, if they stretch out and become lose i will update. But in all seriousness, have expectations for the cheap stuff you buy, cheap underwear will in fact get holes and usually quickly. If you are like me and want cheap black underwear that can do the job and does not have issues with pads (I use flex foam 5 heavy duty for reference) then you should be satisfied or enough with these.",
