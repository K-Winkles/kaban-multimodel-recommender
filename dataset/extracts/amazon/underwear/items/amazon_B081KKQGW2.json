You therefore have boxer briefs that read nauticaca on the back of the waist band when you bend over. His grandma thought I bought them purposely for the saying. Sadly, no but it gave us a few chuckles. Not sure it's the best look for their brand but we now refer to Nautica as Naughty Kaka and not sure I'd buy them again due to that.",

Or they are terrible material. This my friends is called a pink tax!! Anyway, these boxers are awesome for the heat. My usual underwear were giving me heat rash and causing ingrown hair infections. I decided to look for women\u2019s boxers but they are all cheap material or super expensive. Just buy men\u2019s! These are awesome, cotton, the waistband is great, it doesn\u2019t dig in, the thigh is not too tight, they stretch, and they dry quick.",
