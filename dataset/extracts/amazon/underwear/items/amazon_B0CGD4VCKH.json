Wouldn't believe how hard it is to find underwear(especially regular boxers)nowadays that fit correctly and doesn't scrunch things that have absolutely no business being scrunched! I'm mean come on! Anyway, after years of suffering, I found these. Hopefully, they become super popular again as I have no idea why people nowadays want everything scrunched up and liable to twist the wrong way and get a quick ole pinch right in the grocery sac! Did I say their comfy too, and not totally made outta plastic stuff or whatever that sweaty composite the use to make clothes now is called!",
