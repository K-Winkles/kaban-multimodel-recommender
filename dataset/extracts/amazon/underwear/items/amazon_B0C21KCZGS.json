They are comfy, somehow make my pancake butt look like it has some semblance of shape (at least as much as it is possible to do so), and are ridiculously adorable.But.I hate that there has to be a but. Butt (see what I did there?) these otherwise awesome panties have two flaws. First, one of the reasons I bought them was so that I could wear a pad overnight during the heaviest days of my period, but my pads won't stick to them. I've used pads for decades and never had this issue, even with fancy panties, so it's definitely something about the material of these panties. If you're hoping to use these to hold a pad in place, beware.Also, the red panty (my favorite -_-) started shredding in the wash. Only the spare fabric by a seam was affected, and the panty is still totally intact, but I was picking long, tangled strands off my clothing and out of the wash for a week. This was particularly concerning because my idiot cat will eat and be sickened by any spare string he finds--including the string that came off of these panties. Fortunately, I was able to collect it all and toss it out before I saw him, as I was away at the time, but I know I will have to be on the lookout moving forward.",

                "reviewText": "Figured I would try these out and glad I did they are very comfortable, stretchy underwear. They do run on the bigger side since they are stretchy so the next set I get will size down. They are still very noticable under leggings due to the not so seamless leg openings in the underwear. But otherwise a very god nice lair if underwear for working out in or just for everyday use.",
