                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the FINETOO 12 Pack Women\u2019s Seamless Hipster Underwear and I have been extremely satisfied with my purchase. As someone who values comfort and practicality in my underwear, I can confidently say that these panties are a great addition to my wardrobe.First and foremost, the seamless design of these hipster underwear is a game-changer. The absence of any irritating seams means that these panties truly live up to their \"no show\" claim, as they do not create any unwanted lines or bulges under my clothing. This is especially important when wearing form-fitting outfits, as the seamless design provides a smooth and flattering silhouette.The softness of the fabric is another highlight of these panties. They are made from high-quality materials that feel gentle and comfortable against my skin. The fabric is breathable and moisture-wicking, which helps keep me feeling fresh and dry throughout the day.The 12-pack option is also a great value for money. Having multiple pairs of these panties means that I always have a clean and comfortable pair available, even if some are in the laundry. The variety of colors in the pack adds a fun touch to my underwear collection, and I appreciate the ability to mix and match with different outfits.One thing to note is that the sizing runs true to size, so make sure to consult the size chart before purchasing. The fit is snug without being too tight, and the hipster style provides good coverage without riding up.Lastly, I have to mention that these panties are also pet-friendly. As someone who has pets, including a dog, I appreciate that the seamless design minimizes the chances of my pet's nails getting caught on any seams, which can cause snags or tears in other types of panties.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the FINETOO 12 Pack Women\u2019s Seamless Hipster Underwear. They are comfortable, practical, and provide a smooth and seamless look under my clothing. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of comfortable and stylish underwear.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m 5\u20192, 200 lbs and bought an XL. The colors are just as pictured and the underwear is quite soft. The fit isn\u2019t perfect. The underwear fits well around my hips but the butt part is too long. For my bottom to sit in the proper spot, I have to pull the underwear up closer to my waist. They stay where I want them with pants on. Overall, they were a good purchase and I\u2019m keeping them. But probably won\u2019t buy them again.",

The panty is smooth everywhere.I washed 5 of these panties with my regular mixed load i.e. jeans, t-shirts, towels. No shrinkage, no tearing, no fading.3. I did notice 1 or 2 of the panties are larger than the rest. Which, if you have days of bloating is a plus, not a minus.4. I give this product a 10/10. I will buy again.5. AWESOME PRODUCT AT AN AMAZING PRICE!!!",

They ride up quick since my waist is smaller than my hips. So annoying wasting money on underwear that are not flattering at all. I wish they had fit since the material is very soft and smooth :(",
