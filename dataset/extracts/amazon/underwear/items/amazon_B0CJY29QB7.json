These aren't too tight given the same size and actually feel like air can get in and out. It's hard to describe but they feel great. The only negative I've noticed is that after a couple of washes they are noticeably worn. They look more like they should after 6 months of washes, not a couple of weeks. Only time will tell how they stand up.",

                "reviewText": "These BAMBOO COOL Men's Underwear Boxer Briefs are very lightweight and very comfortable and made from viscose rayon originating from renewable bamboo. They have a generous pouch front with a functional fly opening. And the extra stretch that is offered by the 8% spandex in the fabric allows lots of room even for guys who might be super sized.As to the waist size, i generally wear 32inch waist but i decided to go with Large (36-38in) thinking that the instructions were suggesting to order larger than normal. (\u201c . . . you can choose a large size one comparing with the boxer briefs you previously bought.\u201d) I probably should have ignored that \u201csuggestion\u201d and selected the Medium (32-34inch waist) but i am quite happy with the looser fit of the Large. The fabric (viscose rayon) is much closer to the feel of silk than to cotton so the combination of a looser fit and a much lighterweight fabric gives the feeling (almost) of wearing nothing at all. (I am generally a 100% cotton underwear kind-of-guy but change can be good, too.)They are very lightweight but even in fairly bright lighting i don\u2019t see any \u201cshowthrough.\u201d So i would say you could wear these for hours in the lockerroom and no one would be able to guess your true hair color. But the fabric is extremely lightweight. That would likely be a giant plus during hot weather. (We are starting Winter now, so i can\u2019t really do more than guess at how they perform in hot weather right now.)There are also five international laundering symbols near the waistband that were obscure to me so i translated them (in order) below: (refer to photo)washing machine 40\u00b0C/104\u00b0F max water temperaturedo not bleachtumble dry low temperatureiron low temperaturedo not dry cleanThe design is very comfortable. There is a lot to like about the lack of a tag, the lack of side seams and a good quality waistband. But i was rather puzzled about the statement in the listing - \u201cFor your health, it is recommended to change underwear in three months.\u201d (refer to photo) That most certainly cannot relate to laundering and must indicate - instead - that the fabric is not expected to last longer than three months. It is difficult to imagine what might become unhealthy about the underwear after three months assuming that regular laundering is followed. But if this topic causes unease, these might not be the boxer briefs for youAll in all i like these new boxer briefs and expect to get a lot of wear out of them.",

                "reviewText": "Wow, these are comfortable. They are soft, right out of the package. I always wash garments after I receive them and before wearing them but I felt compelled to at least try these on. They\u2019re soft, breathable, and certainly lightweight. They come in nice, neutral colors that I actually like. The band is also comfortable and stretches with your movement. They are true to size. I ordered the Medium as I normally wear a 32-34 size. I must say they accentuate the \u201cpackage area\u201d and my girlfriend seems to love this aspect about them. Lol. I love that these come in a 7 pack; one for every day of the week. I work in the construction industry and I wear these under my work jeans. I wish I\u2019d gotten these sooner. They\u2019re so comfortable. I tend to sweat a lot and these wick away everything throughout the day. They fit nice and snug and keeps everything in order. They\u2019re not too tight and like I said before, move with you.Overall, these are a nice set of boxer briefs and would highly recommend them and the Bamboo Cool brand in general.",

The underwear came in a very nice assortment of colors and seem to be of good quality. The material is soft to the touch and the elastic waist band fits snuggly but still allows plenty of movement. I really liked the \"equipment\" pouch. That detail makes them very breathable and allows you to wear them comfortably all day long. The size chart is true to fit and very accurate in my case. And not to mention, my wife loves the way they look!",
