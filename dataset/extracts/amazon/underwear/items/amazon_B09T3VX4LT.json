They are also soft and breathable...one of my favorite pair of undies! They have lasted me years without stretching out or ripping. I love wearing them at nighttime and under loungewear. I ordered the size 5...I am 117 pounds, 5'4\" and they fit perfectly! They are slightly stretchy, so there is definitely wiggle room. I HIGHLY recommend these!! I will definitely continue to order these because I love them so much. And they aren't those spandex type where your lady-bits can't breathe and feel suffocated! You can actually breathe wearing these, which is a must!",

I can't wear hip huggers or low rise briefs because I have a scar right below my navel (from a gal bladder surgery)... If the briefs don't come up above my navel the waistband rubs that scar and it hurts... But, I also have a very short torso... So, if the waistband comes up above my navel it often feels like they tuck up under \"the girls\"... I also need briefs that provide generous coverage on the back side, and stretch enough to move with me...These briefs ticked all the boxes... They are true to size, have a soft silky feeling, and the waistband hits in just the right spot... Not too high, not too low... The waistband is also soft and does not roll down or pinch... The colors are true to the photo and quite nice...These are the most comfy briefs I have ever worn!! I will be ordering more!!",

I've purchased these several times and in several sizes through pregnancy and postpartum, and I will continue to do so. Now that I have stretch marks, I've noticed the side seam can irritate those. Also, these will leave panty lines on thin pants.",

So far they have held up from washing and drying. I\u2019m definitely going to buy more. If I could give higher ratings I would. The other brand I use to buy discontinued the style I liked and I was very disappointed. Now that I have found these I\u2019m happy I found them. This set are the \u201cbreathable stripes\u201d. I also bought the \u201cbreathable mesh\u201d. Both are perfect.",
