I am glad I didn't jump to do that though because after the third wash, I noticed the underwear would roll on the waist when I wore them. I don't have a huge gut or anything and I am positive I am wearing the correct size. I have had them two months now and the legs aren't gapping or cutting into me like other brands would have done by now. So in that regard, they are nice underwear. The fabric is not thin and cheap like other brands. If these did not roll and stayed tight at the waist, I would give them a perfect 10 rating. I may still chose these over the other brands though, now that I have tried them.",

                "reviewText": "I've gained some weight since the pandemic and finding underwear that:-doesnt look like granny panties- doesn't cut the circulation off my thighs- doesn't roll or slide down my tummy- looks and feels sleek and somewhat sexyWell it's been a challenge. These undies are IT. If you're pear shaped and have a hard time finding panties that fit you in the waist AND the hips and thighs these are incredible. The fabric is so soft. While I wouldn't call these seamless, they are very smooth and don't show under any of the pants or leggings that I've worn. The nude pair work lovely under more sheer garments, and the two toned pair has almost a lace-like look when it's on. They're very similar to a pair I have from Bali, but at a fraction of the price.The only thing I'll mention is that according to this company's sizing chart I'm a 3XL, when in both pants and underwear from most brands I'm an XL. I'm glad I checked the measurements, and I would suggest that you do the same or size up a size or two.Finding panties that don't make me go into full body dysmorphia mode with my weight gain and health issues, and still make me feel put together and sexy has been a challenge, but these fit the bill and I will not be buying anything else. If these look good on my chunky body, I imagine they'd look good on any body type and will continue buying them even after I lose weight and get healthier.I have this set and the lace set and both are silky and well made. I find myself reaching for them both over any other undies in my drawer. Thanks Warner's!",
