The size chart was spot on and a perfect fit. No more creeping, riding, pinching, bunching in places that make me feel uncomfortable. I do not need to fix or adjust them because they migrated. I absolutely love the wide waist band. They are soft but thick while not being too thick to create sweat. They are breathable. Hold up well in the wash. I washed on warm/cool and dried on low. They did not shrink or get damaged in any way. I feel covered and comfortable at all times. I love the colors. I am on a weight-loss journey so when I eventually need a smaller size, I will definitely be purchasing these again. These are the best underwear I have ever owned and I have never said that about underwear before. Will be tossing all my other lower quality cheap underwear. This product has everything I was looking for. THANK YOU!!",

                "reviewText": "These briefs are WONDERFUL! I have been wearing another brand of high-cut cotton briefs for over 12 years but could no longer find them to fit me as before due to the \"sizing up\" that's happening in the clothing industry. Example: those briefs were a Size 6. Now the exact same briefs in a \"6\" are huge on me and a size 4 is non-existent, so ... I was forced to find a replacement that would fit my slender body, and also be styled the same. (I weigh 97lbs and my fanny is pretty flat.)Found this Wirapa brand on Amazon. I read many of the reviews and decided to order them in XS-size because I figured a \"Small\" would be too big for me (based on what I explained above.) Surprisingly the \"XS\" was a little too snug. I returned them thanks to Amazon's easy return policy and ordered the \"Small\" and Perfecto! I've ordered these (2) more times and LOVE them. I LOVE how they fit. The material is buttery-soft, I love the overall styling, the sewing on these is top-notch, and the wide waistband really feels great. I recommend them 100%.",
