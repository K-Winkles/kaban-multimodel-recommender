Usually they're priced too high to justify any of that, but Amazon has a lot of sellers that list these multipacks for a huge discount. You have to look around a little bit to find the right colors and sizes, and for me that was this product.A little over 20$ for these microstretch briefs is a steal. The cotton stretch line is great as well, but the durability isn't great and in my opinion they don't look as good. These ones are superior in breathability, support, and longevity.Definitely get these.",

                "reviewText": "My first time ever using this brand and so happy I took a chance.PouchI have a hard time finding comfortable underwear sometimes because I have a big boy. Most of the time underwear doesn\u2019t have a big enough pouch or stretchy supportive material. Most underwear make me look like I am bulging out, making it extremely uncomfortable to wear nicely fit clothing without everyone staring at my goods. But this underwear had a stretch to it without sacrificing the support, which meant that it fit my package comfortably without giving me a bulky bulge and strong enough to support everything.The elastic bandIt has a strong band and sat right at my hips firmly but not tightly, I was able to still pull it away from my body and had a great stretch. No ride up or roll down, stays in place and doesn\u2019t slide down your butt when you sit down or stand up, really stays with you.Buns and thighsI like how it made my butt look and never felt too skin tight. As I mentioned before the material is stretchy so it moves with you (unlike most stupid cotton underwear) which is great! It also has smooth material to touch so whenever you put your bottoms on, jeans etc it doesn\u2019t gather where you have to readjust after putting on your pants, underwear stays put and pants just glides.I have big thighs always have, part of my genetics and I like to work them out to keep size, so in the past I\u2019ve had to deal with upsizes (yes even if it was trunks vs boxer briefs cuz of ride up) and found that most underwear either the waist was too lose, or material wasn\u2019t strong hold that even with an upsize for my thighs it would still roll up or cut into my thighs. But not these! I stayed with up size and loved how it felt on my thighs. The resistance was strong so it didn\u2019t roll up and held in place without cutting into my legs, all while having stretchy soft fabric. I mentioned the strong band earlier so it felt like I was finally wearing my true waist size while having a good fit on my thighs. If you don\u2019t have big legs stick with your true waist size and the material will still hug you. But if you do have thunder thighs go up a size, trust me you won\u2019t sacrifice waist band fit and your quads will thank you for not squeezing them.Highly recommend these underwear for all men of different sizes, thickness, lengths, the lean and large, but especially if you have a big package, or thick thighs.I do NOT know about durability, how long these will last since I just got so happy with my first pair and immediately wrote a review. Based on everything said, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll last a while just do your laundry correctly and wash them accordingly with the right settings.",
