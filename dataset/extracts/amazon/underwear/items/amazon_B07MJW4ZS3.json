I thought I'd try these since I'm a big Carhartt fan. They seem like they will last a long time, no issues to report after roughly 5 months of wear. They seem to shrink a tiny tiny bit in the leg portion. I'm curious to see how they fair in warmer weather but they've been great so far in colder weather. Price is a tad high but again, the quality is there so far.",
