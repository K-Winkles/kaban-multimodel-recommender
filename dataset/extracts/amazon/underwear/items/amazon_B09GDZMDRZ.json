They\u2019re stretchy, non-binding without being too loose, and I\u2019ve never thought a lot about the width of the gusset area but these have made me a believer in how life-changing a wide gusset is. I\u2019m eager to order more and be able to wear these 24/7.",

( lije gru from minions\u2026) i've tried every style of undies\u2026 even other boy short styles, but I was pleasantly surprised by these. I can stop looking for the perfect undies, these are the ones!! These wash well, are sturdy, feel soft, stretch but still hold everything in place and it made my day when I got them. Have purchased more and will be buying these from now on!",
