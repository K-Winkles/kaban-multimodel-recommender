That being said, I did go up a size so I\u2019d say they\u2019re tts. However, none of them are cut the same resulting in a different fit for every single pair. I\u2019d say these are as good set for everyday wear, they\u2019re comfy and the color pallet is very aesthetically pleasing if you\u2019re into that stuff.Just know the fit is a game of undie Russian roulette.",
