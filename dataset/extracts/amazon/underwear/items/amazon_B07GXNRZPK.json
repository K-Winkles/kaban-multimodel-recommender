                "reviewText": "Purchasing this took me a really long while to contemplate because of it's price. I am bottom sized between UK 16 to 18 and very, very used to wearing low-rise seamless hipster underwear.After wasting a lot of money buying different brands (sloggi, sorella, marks&spencers) of what I thought could be a good replacement for the Uniqlo ones I've been buying for years, I have found this to be the best so far. Ironically, the product description says it fits sizes 0 to 14, so I don't know yet if I will end up stretching these out faster than it should. There is a \"Plus size\" version of this hipster which I bought months ago. It fits loosely and is still on the larger side, though not to the extent that it slides off.The only puzzling thing I found was, I've seen many mixed reviews about this. Some claim to be of a smaller size than me but they still found it tight. And yet there are some who found it was too loose for them.I do suspect that this is a problem for \"one-size\" apparel.To be fair, I've only been wearing these for about 3+ months. I have bought a total of 6 pairs in 3 separate purchases. It is possible that the first 1 piece and 2 pieces purchased were not exactly the same - e.g. one of it feels just a little bit more snug than the others. So I will agree that the sizing is inconsistent somehow (maybe QC issues?) . Seeing that this material is extremely stretchy, I feel it is possible that this is not suitable for smaller sized ladies even though it claims to be. That said, perhaps the brand could consider a range more suitable for sizes M and below.Ultimately I am most satisfied because the they do not give me wedgies after the initial \"breaking in\" period.The different brands I've tried before this, all gave wedgies within the first 1-2 weeks of wearing. The ones that didn't give wedgies were not totally \"seamless\" anyhow.I would likely buy again if these can last longer than my Uniqlo ones.",

I don't really know about the \"one size fits all\" because I'm a pretty average size I think, but they do seem very stretchy so I be they really would fit almost anyone. I have been wearing mostly thongs for many years because I had not found a non-thong panty that I could stand. But I don't ALWAYS want to wear a thong, either. I took a chance on these due to good reviews. They are not cheap. They are worth it to me. I have now ordered more hipsters, and some of their thongs, too, because I'm betting they will be amazing also. I'll be throwing away most of the rest of my underwear now.",

I usually buy hipsters from Jockey because they don't ride up, but these stretch in the bottom and are a much thinner fabric. I doubt I am ever going back to Jockey. These are far more attractive.",

                "reviewText": "If you\u2019re a size 0-8, these will fit fine. If you\u2019re a a size 10 or more, they will be too small. I have an hour glass shape with a 30 inch waist. The panties feel like sausage casing over my ass. It\u2019s also very see through. You would get more coverage from a pair of tights. For the steep price tag, they\u2019re not worth it. More expensive doesn\u2019t necessarily mean better. Well I\u2019m not the kind of person to try to return panties, but I\u2019m not reordering these either.",

                "reviewText": "I was pleasantly surprised at how great this underwear is! First, yes, when you look at it for the first time you probably will think it looks very small. I can tell you, for me, it fits perfectly. I bought two and both are great! They are extremely comfortable and soft. It's a bit much to pay for underwear, in my opinion, but if you are looking for comfort, this might be worth investing in. At least a couple pairs.I will say, I don't think this would be good for anyone past a large, despite saying it's up to XL. It does stretch to conform to your size, but it when I looked at the stretch, if you are XL or borderline XL, I know I would probably want to go up a size. Especially since it is a lot for one pair and no one wants to spend that much on a this piece of underwear and not feel their best.Otherwise, so far, I can only say good things!",
