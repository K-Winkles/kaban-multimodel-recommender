In my pics (without flash), you can see the peach/salmon blanket that is under the panties/undies. Now, I have always worn Fruit of the Loom or Hanes, in bikini or briefs. I am a 55 yr old who has had 2 abdomen surgeries, so now I stick to briefs only! I will tell you... I put these on and they are SO COMFORTABLE! I got them a little bigger, just because I ALWAYS allow for shrinkage when drying. In the pics you can see seems. You DO NOT feel them at all! I HATE any kind of seems; tags; lace; things that make me itch anything that bothers me is a complete NO! Nothing that is on these are an issue! The band is doubled, along with the crotch! The rest is a single piece of material. The stitching(see pic) is so nice! It is made so well, IMO. I just wish it was made a bit thicker all around, lime the Fruit of the Looms were. I like a warm hiney! LOL. Combine the 2 and they would be fantastic! I hope they last!! I would probably get these again. I just really love the band. If you think you wouldn't, DONT! I am so very picky when it comes to EVERYTHING! Theyse are a MUST TRY! I would say they fit as expect too.",

This is coming from someone who usually has worn hipster underwear that also didn't crawl up but I'm fed up with Hanes getting holes after a few months.

I choose them over all my others, every time.These feel good, come up high enough on the waist, are soft with no irritating seams, and give enough support that you feel good. Not too tight like compression or shape wear, just secure. They are a little stretchy but not too much.They aren\u2019t cheeky, and I hope they stay that way after many washes. Sometimes panties give out. So far, so good.I buy mostly cotton underwear, not silky, lacy, or polyester fabrics. Sometimes other fabrics like bamboo or modal are ok, but cotton is best. And that\u2019s what these are.So glad I tried them! Will be ordering more!",
