I've had for about 8 months and these continue to be the first ones I pull out of the drawer. Because I wear these frequently they are washed at least once or twice a week. One pair had a string pulled from the elastic, the others still in perfect shape. I really attribute that to the frequent washing. I'm ordering more so won't have to launder as frequently. I recommend these.",

                "reviewText": "The fit and cut of these are great BUT are poorly made. The elastic waistband, though stretches well, does not allow you to stretch them very much before the threads pop/break which causes the waistband to detatch. In fact the first wear of one pair I hear a thread break as they went over my hip.I know someone would think that I bought too small of a size, but the fit is perfect.In the photos, you can see MULTIPLE areas on the waistband where the thread has brokenand detached.",
