I love these briefs and have purchased nine pairs since they were introduced this year. Very comfortable and stretchy without the feel of lycra or similar fabric. The horizontal fly works well and easily without risk of \"improper tucking\", if you know what I mean. The fabric colors are a bit different from than usual; perhaps the more conservative blacks and grays will come down the pike later. Otherwise, I highly recommend these briefs.",
