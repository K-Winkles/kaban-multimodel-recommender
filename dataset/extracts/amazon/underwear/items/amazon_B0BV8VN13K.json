I'm a thin man so they're not exactly being pushed to the limits or anything and they were brand new.Look good, feel good, unfortunately the quality is very low. I would not buy again and I would not recommend buying these as they fall apart right after first wash.",

These are comfortable, but, nothing special, other than getting a lot of underwear for the money. However, one pair in the pack had loose thread at the thigh hem, which came loose after the first wash (never been worn). I can wear them, but, not if anyone will see them! May be a fluke. This wouldn\u2019t stop me from ordering them. They\u2019re perfectly normal and soft enough, except for the damaged pair.",
