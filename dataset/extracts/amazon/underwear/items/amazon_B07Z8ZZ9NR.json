These were listed as what seemed to me to be for women recovering from C-sections, but they are just so pretty. Not only are they high waisted, but the section that forms the seat is actually wide enough to be comfortable (compared to most underwear that is frustratingly thin and rides up). I like the color selection EXCEPT that they don't offer a red with he navy blue, black and grey pack). I have bought this item two times; once to try, and then the second about a year after the first. Something was a bit different in the cut of the second set, as they ever so slightly press in at the hip, compared to the first package. The lace on that batch also faded much faster in the wash, but I still wear them all and am very happy with my purchase.",

I bought the first two 5-packs for working out because they are all cotton, and fell in love with the comfort and style. On me, they don\u2019t come up as high on the waist as shown, but fit great just below my belly button. I\u2019m not a fan of low cut panties, but don\u2019t want them to look like \u201cgranny\u201d panties, either. The cotton is very soft and there is just enough spandex to keep them fitting well throughout the day. The lace in front is an added feature, without showing through clothing. They wash and dry well on delicate cycle and the lowest heat setting. For reference, I am 5\u20194\u201d and 140 lbs, and ordered size large.",
