These seem to fit a little small and I think that we should have sized up to a medium for him. The waistband is rather snug but not uncomfortable. The legs fit well. The biggest issue is that they dip down in the front more than he\u2019s accustomed to, even though he generally wears his pants and boxers a little low on his waist. The material and construction are good and the fabric is a nice quick dry. Overall the underwear are fine and he\u2019ll wear them but they aren\u2019t his favorite because either the fit.",

They hold everything in place but don't feel too tight or restricted and that is coming from someone who just wears boxers. Tagless and soft waistband. Feels like cotton so no issues of discomfort on the thigh or leg. The crotch area isn't tight like other briefs I have worn and has space for the jewels to be secured, but not suffocated. As a 5'9 and 160lb male, the medium fits just right. Love the colors as well.",
