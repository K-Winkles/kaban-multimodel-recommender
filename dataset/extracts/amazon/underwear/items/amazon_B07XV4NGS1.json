I didn't even have to try them on and immediately did the return/exchange for size 6 medium which I typically wear. I will say they are good quality.UPDATE: I received the size 6 (which I exchanged the 7s for) and they fit perfectly. They have 13% spandex but are not super snug so if you only have some looseness in the belly area, they will work fine. But if you have a big belly that you're calling a gut, don't expect a miracle to flatten it. You'll need to go the route of exercise. LOL They are comfortable and don't seem like they will ride up or roll down on the tummy.",

Not what I thought I ordered since I was expecting cotton vs microfiber. Well... C. These things smoothed out my, uh, how do I say, \"what was baby belly skin after I had babies 18 years ago but since it's skin and not muscle it's not going anywhere without surgery belly\" belly looks SO GOOD. Like, it was the birthday gift to myself I didn't know I wanted (my birthday is tomorrow). Obviously I don't actually want microfiber on its own for my birthday but I'll definitely wear it under a really cute outfit for sure.It feels good. No allergies to the material. No hidden sweat; no itching to the waist or unpleasant feelings at all. They're really comfortable and I've had them on all day.No idea on washability yet but I plan on pinning them into a pillow case on a gentle wash and gentle dry. I don't want to shrink them. I bought them on a size 10 for 248 lbs (sheesh I told the internet my weight) but the fit is perfect.",

These panties are so very comfortable. Wash nicely but I would suggest hang to dry instead of dryer. I think they shrunk a tiny bit in the dryer. Will be ordering more.",

Affordable and durable too. Highly recommend for everyday wear! They may not be the sexiest thing out there, but they feel good under my clothes. :-)",
