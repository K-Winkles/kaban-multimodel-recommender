I made the mistake of recently purchasing size small (I have a size 30 waist) and they were a bit snug on me but a medium seemed perfect. They're comfortable and durable and at the price point, I can't wait to stock up with more.",

Honestly this is likely my favorite underwear at the moment, even the first time I wore them.",
