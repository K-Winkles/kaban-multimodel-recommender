                "reviewText": "First off this is from a mother\u2019s POV so keepthat in mind that has a teenage girl.My daughter is tall, lean and small bone framed- and naturally awkward- so with her 5\u20196\u201d almost 5\u20197\u201d which is taller than me- it can be quite hard to figure out what works. Also I brought this one on desperation- we ordered it while at a convention because we did not have pads. It was over night delivery so we had it ready to go.Then we have sensory issues- things need to be soft, flowy, easy to clean. This I feel is human nature at this point- anything that touches our skins has to feel comfortable (but being comfortable is in the eye of the beholder).This product is in fact underwear. The sewn in- that is right- sewn in pad is the thickest part of the underwear but my daughter says it still feels like underwear- no extra bunching or embarrassing crunching sound when moving around.I have assured her that the outside world does not \u201chear her pad\u201d but she swears they do. Confirmed with my parent- I said the same thing at her age. So maybe it is a thing.She can wear it all day- even doing her sports, waiting in lines and games with no leaks. She also sometimes has incontinence accidents as well- she thought it was just her period and well\u2026 it wasn\u2019t. Again- she is a young woman figuring out her body and knowing different feelings and sensations. Completely normal but embarrassing.She would have accidents on a regular basis around her period since it was hard to figure out what was happening. Luckily she felt very comfortable with the school nurse and she was able to keep a spare of her clothes in her office.Now a few years have passed and my daughter was wearing pads for about half the month because she didn\u2019t know when it would begin- again it is normal. She also didn\u2019t want her dad to see blood or pee on her panties when he did laundry.My husband didn\u2019t care- he knew she was having trouble and it\u2019s normal and joked with saying I rather see monthly blood than a positive pregnancy test. *yeah he is that type of dad.My daughter can also wear them even when she is not on her period since they are just that comfortable and gives her a sense of security.Cost effective- we can buy these panties, wash them (more on that in a bit) and re use them.Eco friendly- since there are no pads, no paper waste. Since she does not feel comfortable wearing menstrual cups- this is a great alternative.Travel friendly- just place the dirty panties with the other dirty clothes and it\u2019s fine. No smell, leakage (if wearing the right absorbent coverage) and it just looks like regular panties so for TSA searches- it isn\u2019t embarrassing for a shy woman to have it in her carry on bag (as you know- always carry at least one outfit- underwear and socks included- in case there is delay or lost checked luggage).Discrete- she wear them and if her period begins- then it\u2019s not a problem, she can just carry on with her day.Washing- beyond easy- first wash (except this order because we needed these panties and could not find her previous period panties) just panties by themselves- regular wash is just fine. We did do sanitize wash all of her period panties once a month when she is finished so she has fresh ones for next month but that is just our personal practice and no medical backing. Just something I figured it would be a nice tradition to do. Drying is easy- toss in the dryer and no big deal.She likes these because she can wear them at night and no issues.We have also realized that they make period panties with different padding for different flows. This is awesome since flows can vary- so can switch out and wear the ones that fit her best needs. She personally likes the heavier flow ones on her actual period and wears the light ones on non period days or testing days (she gets nervous and is afraid to have an accident- so if she does pee- it\u2019s not noticeable and she can continue with her test/s).Overall I would recommend for any woman that has menstrual cycles and/ Urinary incontinence- these types of panties are perfect.Also it is true to size based off the size guide.Update: my grandmother is now using these panties post op because of her Urinary incontinence after her catheter was taken out. She also likes them and said they very comfortable. She also said it was true to size.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to try period underwear because I went on a safari this summer, and I wasn't sure how much regular access I'd have to decent bathrooms (part of the safari was camping). The period underwear enabled me to travel all day without worries--no leakage (though I do not have a heavy flow). The underwear is easy to clean--I could rinse it out until I had a chance to launder it. It worked really well for this trip, and I found the underwear comfortable and well-fitting.It's a little bulkier than regular underwear (though not any bulkier than regular underwear with a pad), so I'm not sure how much I'll use it for everyday, but it was well worth the purchase for me. I definitely like having it on hand, even if I don't fully make the switch to this more eco-friendly option for dealing with periods.",

                "reviewText": "Ignore the numbers in the sizing section, go to the last picture with the back of the packaging and match your pant size to the underwear size. The underwear size numbers don't correlate to any other sizing chart I've ever seen honestly but then again in women's fashion, the numbers are completely made up and arbitrary.The only issue I have with these is the very stiff seam that goes across the butt. You wouldn't be able to wear these with anything tight or very smooth without that seam showing. It'll also kinda give you a lumpy butt lolOther than the sizing weirdness and the lumpy butt seam, they're very comfortable. I think they're great starting on day 3 of your period. I wouldn't try these on days one or two.",
