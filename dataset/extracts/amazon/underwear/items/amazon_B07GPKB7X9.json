The cover good portion and are a little and they don\u2019t roll down. They work fine with pads and don\u2019t cause wedgie.

                "reviewText": "I love this underwear! I am short-waisted and a bit fluffy so buying higher waisted undies help eliminate the constant slipping under my belly other panties do. I have the grannies, the cute but annoyingly small undies and even the lace sexy/not sexy underwear but none are functional and cute. These are! They fit my shape very well without sacrificing comfort. For example, the thigh elastic doesn't pinch or pull or roll which I have a problem with on other fitted underwear. So these are good for larger thighs. Great buy and the seller was excellent at getting me in the right size! Will be buying more in the future.Update: 6/2022Ok I keep trying to find cheaper and equally as comfortable underwear brands from other sellers but these appear to be the best freaking underwear for fluffy women like me by far. This is my 3rd purchase of this brand and they are still as comfortable as the first day I bought them. They stretch out a bit and of course die the regular death of undies after awhile but they wash well and last. I love how comfortable they feel and they last a while. The reason for only 3 purchases is because I am cheap and really wanted to find some bargains but nope, I have to stick with these and will probably actually bulk buy next time because I would hate to run out of this exact brand and not be able to get them in the future. A lot of other ones look like these, claim to fit like these but DO NOT. I have another brand on today that tricked me like that and may end up handed over to my daughter like all the rest. Luckily she likes these high waisted underwear, wears close to my size and doesn't know that the ones I keep are the good ones :) For reference, I am 5 ft 4 inches, 215 lbs., with a c-section belly, and wear size 18-20 (40 inch waist). She is 5 ft 10 inches, 165 lbs. wears a size 16 pants and has a 36 inch waist. I wear XL and it pulls me in comfortably and she wears L but can still fit the XL.",
