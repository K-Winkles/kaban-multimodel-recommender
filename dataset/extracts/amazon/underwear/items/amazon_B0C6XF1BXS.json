They sit about 7\" from top of my knee and go up to top of my hips, about 1-1/2\" below my navel. Close fitting against the skin but not compressing. Waistband is snug but not too tight and doesn't fold as easily as other Amazon underwear I've worn. They've been washed and haven't shrunk at all. The only flaw I think is the seat. I have substantial glutes and the waistband slides down in the back. It still keeps everything covered - no plumbers crack - but could be better. A little more rise in the rear would be good.Many complaints about waistband being too high, tight, or folding but I didn't find any of those to be true. Maybe if they're the wrong size or wearer is overweight. I wouldn't consider them high rise unless they came up to my navel.",

The reason it's nice because with extra long legs, they won't rolled-up as you sitting down in the car. When you drive for a living you want a nice comfortable underwear so it won't rolled-up to your crack. I have tried most and this Jockey is the best in my opinion and that's not to say that they are not very good.",

The legs are a nice length as well keeping in mind they are midway brief instead of boxer brief so they are longer. The fabric is very comfortable, the elastic is just right (not too tight and not too loose), and the quality seems to be there (so far). I have had these for four months, and I am impressed thus far. I will update this review if they like fall apart in a week, but so far so good.",
