Probably - they have a lot of stretch to them. I\u2019m 5\u20196 and 120lbs, what size would fit me best? I would see that to know how big is your ministry? 120 mm should give you a size S I\u2019m between sizes also 6 to an 8 . 5\u20195\u201d weigh 133 haven\u2019t measured my hips which size is suit for me? I would go with a size medium for they run true to size. I weigh about 115 pounds and normally wear size 4 pants or size small panties. buy a small or medium in these panties? A small. I'm 5'2\", weigh 123 lbs., and got a medium. It fits good, but I probably could have gotten a small myself, but it may have been a little too small for me.

                "reviewText": "I'm 5'1, 115 pounds, very small-boned and short-waisted. I'm also a middle-aged mom.I got the R6004S style in the colors \"skin\" and \"white,\" in size small.The fabric is thin, but I don't like wearing thick full-cotton underwear, so this is a good thing for me.The lace waistband is what really made me purchase these panties. I'm not a full-on lacey thong/tanga/cheeky panty type of woman. I wish I could be that woman, but I'm not. But having that bit of lace on the waistband adds that little feminine touch to an otherwise basic panty. That's enough for this plain Jane.Aside from adding that feminine aesthetic to the panty, the lace waistband makes for a smoother \"hug\" factor at the waist if you know what I mean. I'm not a fan of thin elastic digging into my waist-area, and the wider and softer waistband that the lace provides prevents that from happening.Also, the lace itself is very soft. VERY soft. I can't speak for how well it will wear over time, but it seems like it will last at least one year of regular wear.On me, the rise is moderate, falling right between the rises of the bikini and brief. This is another plus for me because I can no longer wear low-rise anything, and because I'm short-waisted, regular briefs tend to land above my natural waistline.As for sizing, I would say it is accurate. I always buy \"small\" in underwear, and this panty seemed true to size. However, if I were to gain weight, I feel I would need to size up to a \"medium\" when I buy these again.The color \"skin\" is a peachy-beige and is very pretty in person. The \"white\" is a true pure white. I'm happy with my purchase and I would definitely get these again.",
