Coming with a mesh structure that's highly breathable, lightweight and can easily wick away moisture, wearing them is almost like wearing nothing. Plus, the virtuous craftsmanship from our designers makes sure the thongs do not ride up or fall down or dig into your sacred ravines in the front and back.",

Drawing upon years of R&D, we have successfully made that annoying pantie line invisible and by that, these panties your no-brainer go-to choice, whatever outfit you might want to sport.",

So, I purchased the 5 pack of floral in size L.PROs: very soft and lightweight material, no VPL, floral patterns very pretty, great price for what you getCONs: wish openings had a little more elastic feel to them; underwear has an occasional \u201cgaping\u201d feel around leg openings on the backside when bending at the hip (knee raises and simply walking forward) and verified in front of mirror (if that makes sense).Overall, this is a good product and I would have rated at 3.5 stars mainly due to elastic issue. Perhaps sizing down might fix the gaping issue for me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I would consider purchasing again.",

They are so soft and smooth, I really wish they worked. They don't seem too big when they first go on. They seem perfect.

I normally wear a small so that\u2019s what I bought. When I tried the first pair on under yoga pants, I was disappointed because they seemed a bit tight and a slight panty line was visible for that reason. I almost returned them to size up, but decided to wear a pair for the day to see if I liked them enough to buy them in a bigger size. I\u2019m glad I did, because the fit relaxed a bit during the first wear and now they\u2019re a perfect fit, with no visible panty line. I haven\u2019t washed them or worn any of the pairs more than once so I can\u2019t comment on whether there is a potential for them to relax too much to where they bunch or lose their shape, but I\u2019ll update this comment if that is the case. So far so good, I just ordered another pack in nude!!",
