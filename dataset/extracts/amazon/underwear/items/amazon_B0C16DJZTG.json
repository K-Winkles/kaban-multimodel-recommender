They can be used as ordinary panties, but also as postpartum panties and cesarean panties, and the soft fabric will not irritate the skin.",

A tad tight around the seams at first but stretch out just enough after one wear, so the seams don't dig in like elastic. They feel like I could wear them in the summer under a dress with no shorts to hold them up. Knocked 2 stars off because the gusset is only sewn in along the back side and glued on the other 3 sides - it started to peel away after the first wash. However, I have had such a hard time finding comfortable plus-sized underwear that I ordered 2 more and will just sew the gusset in properly before wearing.",
