I'm 5'1 about 110 lbs and wear a size 2. I got the medium because I have an athletic build with thighs and a booty. They fit perfectly! Nothing I own that has elastic (or that I like and fits perfectly) goes in the dryer EVER! I'm sure they'd shrink drastically! Highly recommend, I've purchased 3 different packs because we all know that when we love something, the manufacturers eventually do away with it or ruin it by changing it!",

Wasn't even worn 5 hours before having to toss a pair in the trash. I would go for a refund/replacement. But considering 1 was already worn I just dealt with the $ loss. Really want to order more, but waiting to see if the others let go as well. I will update my review pending.",
