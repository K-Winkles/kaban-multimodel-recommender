That limits my options, but I've always heard good things about Pair of Thieves.Tried them out and they're fantastic!Loose but secure.Form fitting but comfortable.Hot enough that your SO will want them off, cool enough you won't want to take them off.The hole in front has many uses Kings.Think about it.I'm a cheapskate for sure, so the 3 for $40 is new to me. But I'm willing to say that I'm happy with this purchase.I've been on a new underwear bender trying to find the perfect pair. I believe everyone needs some variety. These are a must have for sure.When the time has come for my other chonies to move on, I'll be grabbing another Pair of Thieves.See what I did there?P.S. These things come in handy in the hotter months. I normally throw on some basketball shorts, but these things are like an all in one.What art thou waitingest on Kings?GET SOME!",

                "reviewText": "I have been wearing Calvin Klein for a long time and decided to try a bunch of new underwear. This pair of underwear has a very unique feel and material compared to the others. It is maybe the most comfortable pair of underwear when it is dry, but absolutely terrible at moisture absorption. If you sweat in these or get rained on, they are the most uncomfortable thing you will ever wear. But on cool nights with no sweat, these are the comfiest pair I have. Very strange. Quick comparisons to the other brands are below in order of my preference.1. Lululemon Always in Motion Boxer 5 Inch - 5 Stars: Easily the most comfortable, but pretty pricey. The only pair that doesn't ride when moving around.2. Under Armour Men's Tech 6-inch Boxerjock 2-Pack - 4.5 Stars: Not quite as comfortable as Lululemon, but still pretty comfortable and more affordable. Great at absorbing moisture but ride up your leg a bit sometimes.3. Calvin Klein - 4-5 Stars: I actually have a ton of these and don't remember the exact ones. Some of them fit decently well, and some not so much. On average they are pretty decent though4. ExOfficio Men's Give-n-go Boxer Brief - 3.5 Stars: These are... fine. They are middle of the road in comfort and good at absorbing moisture. But for the price there are just way better options.5. Pair of Thieves Super Fit Underwear for Men Pack - 2 & 3 Pack Boxer Briefs - AMZ Exclusive - 3.5 Stars: These are weird. Super comfy when dry, but terrible moisture absorption. When even slightly wet they are super uncomfortable. Definitely don't plan to sweat in these.6. Pair of Thieves Cotton Boxer Briefs for Men Pack (4 Pack) - 4 Stars: Not as comfortable as all of the non-cotton options, but a decent value.7. Smartwool Boxer Brief - 1 Star: Complete and utter garbage. Overpriced, not very comfortable, not any better at wicking moisture away than all of the similar priced options.",
