                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Seriously HAPPY \ud83d\ude0a with my first ever online underwear purchase!",
                "reviewText": "So I decided to post pictures with this review of everything that I would have liked to know before purchasing these underwear. I had never before bought underwear online and it took about 2 days of going back and forth reading reviews and still not being sure of the exact size because supposedly there is no set standard? I wear a size 16 in woman\u2019s jeans and sometimes an 18 if they run super small but most sized 18 pants are way too big. So it\u2019s odd. I ordered a size XXL in these because I really just didn\u2019t know and they seemed gigantic when I pulled them out of the package but then I sent them through the wash with my other laundry nothing special then threw them in the dryer hot like always and they came out looking much more my size not like a flag or a sail for a \u26f5\ufe0f boat. I felt so much better! I put them on and they fit great not too big at all and not too tight, I feel like as I\u2019ve gotten older after my 30\u2019s I was trying to fit in way too small a size of underwear that used to fit. I\u2019ve recently gotten into these hipster underwear because they stay in place and aren\u2019t granny like at all. I don\u2019t do briefs because it\u2019s too much fabric for my taste. And department stores are really expensive 3 for 30$ seriously \ud83d\ude33 that\u2019s no deal and searching through clearance on my knees hurts after 5 min I\u2019m literally sitting on the floor with my not so cheap designer bag flung next to me looking probably like a crazy \ud83d\ude1c woman. So yes I made it through my first online order for underwear and couldn\u2019t be happier. The quality seems really good and I hope you can see the stitch work in my pictures. I don\u2019t wear pads but I\u2019m sure they will stick in the crotch part just fine, I added pics of the crotch as well and it\u2019s grey in all of them that I got in this pack. No issues no strings hanging after the wash and I doubt it will ever happen anytime soon. The cotton material is pretty soft, I\u2019ve had softer but once again those were one pair I randomly did find once in a clearance bin at a department store, I can\u2019t help it I always look, the waist band is covered nicely and the leg holes are as well(see pics)! The striped ones and solids are nice bright colors too, I like that and they match up at the seams. I always look at seams to see if they match. These do, funny because my Dad taught me how to spot that when I was way younger and how if they don\u2019t match it\u2019s cheap junk, no matter what you are buying. They did a pretty good job on the seams so I am satisfied there too. So my first online underwear purchase was a complete \ud83d\udcaf success I should also add just buy them, I know you will still read a ton more reviews I did. But the price is on point and Prime delivery \ud83d\ude9a came within 24 hours for me, got to \ud83d\udc99 Prime! Oh and package was nice and professional( see pic)! Definitely give these a go and if not try and try again, but I\u2019m super picky and hard to please, 5 \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f All the way!!! I really hope that I helped someone out there with this review, seriously that\u2019s why I write these because sharing is important and opinions matter! Definitely \ud83d\udcafSATISFIED \ud83d\udcaf!!!",

They are not thin, they're opaque, and the colors are solid and attractive. These are easily way better than the Reebok ones I bought a while ago which started to fall apart quickly. The price is great too. I will probably buy more in the future.",

                "reviewText": "When five years pass after your last underwear purchase, it can be difficult to find the same undergarments as manufacturers are always changing styling, sizing or materials. I was looking for FOTL Breathable Cotton Mesh in hip huggers that came out in 2017, but they are no longer made. I decided on these as they looked similar and I wanted all white, no mixed colors. I almost went with Jockey, but they are priced more, so I decided to try the Innersy brand. Please read the sizing information for these, at the end is a P.S. about them being a snug fit. I measured my hips, 36 1/2\" and first chose size Small, but after reading about the snug fit and that I normally don't wear size small in most things, like blouses, so I decided to go with the size Medium.Overall I am very happy with them!The package of six arrived quickly, the package being a plastic slider bag. I measured one pair prior to laundering them: Flat rough measurements across top 13 1/2\", from top to bottom 9 1/2\", leg opening 7 1/2\". I then laundered them with similar white items, dried them on low and measured them. They reduced a fraction over 1/4\" in all measurements.These are made in China, and I normally avoid Chinese manufactured clothing as they don't last long. That's why I gave these four stars as I've only had them for a week. The material is a soft brushed cotton that isn't real thin like some cottons today where you can easily see through them. It's easy to tell if you have them right side out as the liner is a light gray cotton material. These have the cotton covered elastic waistband and leg bands, which is what I was looking for. When I put them on, they were amazingly comfortable to do so. The look is very nice and are soft to the touch. Good job to this company, and I will be ordering more before any changes are made to these in the future. I hope not.I usually buy Fruit of the Loom in size 6. I used to buy Hanes, but somewhere back in the early to mid 2000's, their overall sizing was reduced, so instead of the size 6 I used to buy, they became too tight and I had to go up to size 7. I said \"forget them\". These Innersy Women's Underwear Cotton Hipster Panties Regular medium size are like a Hanes size 7 or a FOTL size 6 for my 36 1/2 inch hip.Edited: 2 years later and I still like these. Shrinkage is not bad. Dimensions of size medium are Across top: 13 1/4\", across widest point: 14 3/4\", Top to Bottom center 9 1/2\", side seam length 5\", leg opening outside edge 7\". When I lay Hanes size 6 cotton bikini on top of these, the Hanes are 1/4\" wider. If I lay FOTL cotton bikini across the top, the FOTL are 1/2\" wider. The most noticeable difference between these Innersy white cotton underwear vs. Hanes and FOTL is the leg openings are smaller on the Innersy white hipster, not really noticeable for long after you put them on. Also, the Innersy are softer cotton than the other two brands and feel a bit thicker in density, which I like. They are still holding up to many washing and dryings. I'm thinking of getting a size Large next time to see how they fit, as the mediums are every so slightly tight, but not in an uncomfortable way. Currently my hips measure 35\".",

I liked them so much, I bought a second pack and I don't regret it. I expect them to also last, not fall apart after a couple of washed. As long as they make these, I will buy them.",
