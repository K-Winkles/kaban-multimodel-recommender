They don\u2019t ride up, the size/fit is as expected, and the lace isn\u2019t at all scratchy. The quality seems fine so far, although I\u2019ve only had them a few months. My only complaint is that, strangely, one pair in the pack was noticeably smaller than the rest even though the size was marked the same. Fortunately, they\u2019re still wearable, and I don\u2019t really notice the difference once they\u2019re on. The style is a bit more \u201cgranny panty\u201d than I might have once chosen, but they\u2019re not too bad\u2014and I care less and less with every passing year. Recommended.",
