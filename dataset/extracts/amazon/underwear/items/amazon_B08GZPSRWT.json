The comfort level of these boxer briefs is unmatched, thanks to the soft, breathable cotton fabric that feels great against the skin. The fit is just right, offering ample support without being too tight, and the longer length prevents chafing. The waistband doesn't dig in, providing an all-day comfortable wear. I appreciate the durability of these boxer briefs \u2013 they withstand regular washing without losing their shape or color. The variety of colors and patterns in each pack adds a touch of fun to my underwear drawer. Whether for daily wear or workouts, these boxer briefs deliver on both comfort and functionality. Overall, Fruit of the Loom Men's Boxer Briefs offer a fantastic combination of comfort, durability, and style at an affordable price, making them an excellent choice for any man's wardrobe.",

I just don\u2019t understand why the prices so much probably because they know they can charge so much what we really need is a more reasonable and wear in socks for men instead of them being overpriced but yes, I would suggest purchasing these, if you have a Need for great underwear plus if you buy the big man size like myself, for example, like my husband who is a police officer who has very large arms and legs, but in this situation, we\u2019re talking about his thighs because he works out and he\u2019s a large muscular person. And again you don\u2019t have to be muscular you can be overweight but regardless if you have big legs, the big man size of this brand is the way to go. I purchased three XL the first time but they were just way too large so I ordered two XL this time and it works great so they\u2019re definitely true to the size.",
