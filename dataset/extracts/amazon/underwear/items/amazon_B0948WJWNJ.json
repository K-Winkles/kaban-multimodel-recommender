                "reviewText": "I recently threw away a bunch of underwear that was misshapen and uncomfortable. In particular, I hate having to constantly adjust my underwear because it is sliding around/riding up. I consulted with my two sisters about what they liked, and they both recommend Warner's No Muffin Top. So, I purchased this set, and I also got a similar set from an unknown brand. I have included photos and will compare the two in this review - the Warner's is the light blue with the black lace waist, and the other brand is the darker heathered blue.I ordered a 3-pair set of this underwear in the Plumberry/White/Holiday Print. There are a lot of styles to choose from (although I would have preferred a set of three dark colors with design). I ordered my usual size, medium (6 in underwear, usually 8 in pants). I do really like the colors, which look just like the product photo; I found the contrasting black lace band a nice touch. I decided to wash these before wearing. These are 90% Polyester, 10% Elastane, and they did very well machine wash/dry - they didn't shrink, and the lace stayed flat.These underwear fit very comfortably on me. The lace sits nice against my body and is not scratchy. The look attractive--I especially like the v-shaped dip in the front--and they nicely hug my curves, while also having plenty of rear coverage. As you can see, in comparison to the other set I bought, these are slightly bigger; I think that combined with the stretchy fabric made these just a bit more comfortable. Most of the time, I forget that I am wearing them, and I have been especially impressed that these stay in place even when I am exercising!I am so glad I asked my sisters for recommendations and am extremely happy with these. They are a little pricier than mass-market options, but I think they are worth it, and I will definitely be buying more when I need them. The ONLY thing I don't like about these is that the product information is printed on the back of the underwear in a very LARGE block of DARK ink; on my white ones, it is in black, and it is VERY noticeable, taking up a lot of space.UPDATED 7/18/22:This panties have held up well, and I do still like them. However, in contrast to my review above, I have found that the less expensive ones I purchased at the same time are more comfortable, whereas these Warner ones due tend to ride up at times (depending on what I am wearing). I think I might try another set in the microfiber to see if they are better.",
