So far i have worn two pairs to work recently, Couldn't get a slightly bigger size than what i did buy so was little iffy bout these. they are snug for my fat body, but for the most part are comfy. they ride up a little bit as i work about but no chaffing so far, breathable, not falling down, etc. If your around a 52 waist or so they will be little snug but anything under you should be able to find your perfect fit.",
