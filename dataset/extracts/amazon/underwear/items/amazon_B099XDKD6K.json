They would fall right down. I usually get my undies from Target and that's the size that always fits so I was surprised.I figured I'd just go down a size, but I'm glad I double checked the size chart. I ended up ordering a medium based on the chart. These fit WAAAAAY better. They're super comfortable and soft.I wish there were more options for colors and I REALLY wish there was an option to get all black.",

I was worried about the dark green bleeding onto other colors but they're completely colorfast, no problems. No snags, no runs, no badly-made seams, just generic decent-quality underwear that's comfortable to wear. Very minimal lines, no riding up or shifting around, overall a good purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Dank das Amazon Vine Programms durfte ich die Damen Bikini Slips von Amazon Essentials testen.Unterh\u00f6schen kann man einfach immer gebrauchen, besonders wenn sie sch\u00f6n aussehen und zudem noch bequem sind.\ud83d\udda4 Lieferung/Verpackung:Schnell wie von Amazon gewohntDie Damen Slips kommen in einer einfachen Plastikt\u00fcte. Nichts war besch\u00e4digt und ich konnte keinen unangenehmen Chemiegeruch oder Sonstiges wahrnehmen. Die Unterhosen selbst machen einen guten Eindruck.\ud83d\udda4 Lieferumfang/Artikel:Man bekommt sechs sch\u00f6ne Damen Unterhosen, welche wie ein Slip geschnitten sind. Ich habe die Farbvariante \"Schwarz/Hazelnuss\" gew\u00e4hlt. Die Farbe und das Design ist ideal f\u00fcr den Alltag. Die Unterhosen sind zu 78% aus Polyamid und 22% Elasthan gefertigt und somit angenehm zu tragen. Das Material ist sehr weich.Bei der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe habe ich eine 38 zugeschickt bekommen. Normalerweise trage ich Unterw\u00e4sche eine Nummer gr\u00f6\u00dfer (M-L), da ich es etwas lockerer mag. Die Slips fallen gr\u00f6\u00dfengerecht aus und schn\u00fcren nicht ein, noch sind sie kratzig ect.\ud83d\udda4 Qualit\u00e4t:Die Unterhosen sind sehr gut und ordentlich verarbeitet. Sehen toll aus und haben ein gutes Tragegef\u00fchl.Das erste Waschen haben die H\u00f6schen schon hinter sich und haben weder an Form, Farbe oder Gr\u00f6\u00dfe verloren.\ud83d\udda4 Fazit: F\u00fcr den Alltag gute Slips die zudem sch\u00f6n aussehen. W\u00fcrde sie wieder kaufen",
