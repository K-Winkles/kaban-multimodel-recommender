They fit where they should and stay put, standing, sitting, squats, all good!-They aren\u2019t bulky, so the edges don\u2019t stick out through skirts or dresses.I love these so much, and highly recommend getting some for yourself.

                "reviewText": "\ud83d\udcccI had these underwear in my wish list for almost 5 months I don\u2019t know why I just didn\u2019t purchase them from the start. I literally tried all sorts of different brands and even different sizes of the same underwear just to find the fit I was searching for. So it seems I have found them, tucked away in my wish list for months, I guess it\u2019s because of the cost? But honestly it\u2019s about 3-4$ more than some brands on Amazon but definitely worth it. Other brands that were around 22$ or so just didn\u2019t fit me in the legs and the stomach it was either or. This brand fits great. I did actually purchase a size XL at first but those were too large, so I sized down to the LARGE and I am so happy with the fit. My sister was so impressed with how these POKARLA undies looked when I pulled them out of the packaging, she ordered herself some. New packaging and arrived one day early as well! Ok here\u2019s my stats just so you know because let me tell you how many reviews I had to read and it seemed like no other shoppers except a handful actually listed what size they wear and what size to order. I just want to help someone out there who needs it. So I am 5\u20194\u201d and I weigh around 205, I carry all my weight in my stomach area and I\u2019m more of a athletic body type, yeah I could stand to loose a few but shoot it\u2019s called life happens and i am a work in progress. Hence; the high waist underwear works for me, I really didn\u2019t know these existed like this, I used to love hipsters but all the ones I used to purchase from the box stores all were cheap and never held up plus they really cost a lot more than they used to, I was over those brands and even moved to discount bins at higher end department stores, ugh no luck. So this brand is great. Well made I did see some stitching I am sort of worried about so into the wash they went and I will update my review in a few weeks to see if these hold up like I hope they would! Love the colors and that the waist band is different colored than the rest of the underwear and also the stitching that stands out in the front part, really cute! They are definitely comfortable I will say that and no roll down issues either yes there is a panty line, but I can work with that. I will be updating in a few weeks like I said. I definitely recommend this purchase \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fHope I\u2019ve helped somebody out! Be safe out there \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37",

                "reviewText": "I just love these! I searched a lot of brands and styles, and read a lot of reviews before settling on these gems! I wanted some cotton underwear with stretch for comfort and was not disappointed. I'm a big bottomed girl, large around the butt and thighs, a true 'pear shape'. I ordered these a size up 'just in case' they didn't fit true to size. I could have ordered a size down (I'm usually a 3X, purchased the 4X) because these do have enough stretch in them but I am more than satisfied with the fit of the larger size...These panties are comfortable, the high waist stays where it is supposed to, it doesn't roll down. They don't bunch up, the fit is smooth and while the stretch is there, they also hold you in a bit, a bonus for me. The cotton fabric is thick enough to absorb any perspiration on hot summer days and will probably be warm for cooler days as the season progresses to cooler months. The fabric is soft, the gusset in the crotch has only one seam but that doesn't matter as far as fit goes. The seam is more in the center than one front and one back and I like that better as to me it's more comfortable. All in all I am more than pleased with these and will certainly order again. I wanted a change of pace from my usual brand (Just My Size, Fruit of the Loom) and am happy I chose these. If you buy them, you'll love them.",
