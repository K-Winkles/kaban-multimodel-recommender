They have the seam that goes right up to crack of your rear end which I find uncomfortable but they don't have the huge holes for women with large thighs and we're ins. So it's one of the few panties that fit women with a apple shape",

                "reviewText": "I have seen a lot of reviews on this page promoting the use of these even for men. I typically wear boxer briefs and was looking for something that I could wear everyday to work. My work involves frequent cycles of sitting at my desk and getting up to go to the workshop. This causes my boxer briefs to ride up my leg. In addition, they are bulky, so when the leg rides up, you can feel it as well, especially under formal pants. Keeping an open mind, I decided to try this product after reading the description and the reviews. The different colors have different prices, so I chose this one as it was cheapest. I was also hesitant about sacrificing my machismo.After trying these panties, I can't say enough about how amazing they are! They feel almost non-existent, provide excellent support (everything in front fits great, it is very spacious), feel great up against your skin and are surprisingly discreet (when you tuck your shirt in, but I wear formals to work, so not a problem). When you're not constantly trying to dig your underwear out and flatten it under your pants, you can concentrate on other things better! I can only say this - every man should have the option to try products like these. Seriously, as one of the commenters below stated, market these to men as well! Bali is missing out on such a large user demographic! Even men that want to try this out right now, buy a simple black, white or plain color if you feel shy or hesitant. After trying just this one, I find boxer briefs way more uncomfortable than before and will definitely buy a lot more. Great product, excellent sizing, superb fit and comfort!",
