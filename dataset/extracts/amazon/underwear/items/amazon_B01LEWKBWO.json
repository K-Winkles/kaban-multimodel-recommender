They are cool when they need to be cool and warm when they need to be warm. I live in the north country and even on mornings already at 20 degrees this year I wasn\u2019t suffering from major cold shrinkage! I have two other types of DA underwear and they are great in warmer climates or summer but these have been the best fit and most comfortable so far. Where were these when I was younger?",

                "reviewText": "I have used a local midwest company, Duluth Trading, underwear for many, many years and never thought to look anywhere else. Durability-wise, that company was and is top notch. Price-wise, super expensive.. but they last forever. Literally the only problem I had was always being hot and sweaty all the time. I couldn\u2019t find a solution with them, so I started to look on Amazon and saw the reviews on this pair of underwear.I love the designed pouch for support and keeping \u201ceverything\u201d separated from your legs, it\u2019s supportive but free feeling at the same time, I\u2019m not sure how else to explain that. If you buy them, you\u2019ll know what I mean. That\u2019s a big thing for me to keep from sticking to your legs and not feel tight in the pouch area. It took a little getting used to since they\u2019re a fairly tight-to-skin boxer brief style, but they have quite a bit of elasticity. The band on top isn\u2019t tight and actually I would like a tiny bit more tightness with that so it doesn\u2019t ride down.. and I\u2019m not a big person by any means. I\u2019m 6\u20190\u201d 190lbs and I got a size Large. It\u2019s not unmanageable and maybe it\u2019s just me getting used to them vs the other Duluth Trading kind.The feel is great, they feel like you\u2019re almost wearing nothing which is the feel I was going for. They look great, obviously with the pouch in the front it creates a little extra emphasis on your goods, my wife commented on that right away.Lastly, whatever they\u2019re made out of is extremely breathable. The main reason for my search of new underwear\u2026 I don\u2019t feel like these are retaining any heat. They don\u2019t cool by any means, but they are breathable and let go of your body heat with ease!Never in my life have I written about underwear, especially in such detail! This is worth it. I hope it helps.",

                "reviewText": "I got these after searching for boxer briefs with a pouch that don't break the bank. To be transparent, I just got them yesterday and washed and wore immediately, so I can't speak to long-term wear. But that's not my attempt here. I don't think I need to own a particular boxer brief for a long time to know what I like/dislike.So, here goes: These are probably the best you can do at this price point, but I there are two areas in which they could greatly improve.1. The waistband is \"fine,\" but I wish it were about a quarter-inch wider. The band is on par with mass-market underwear bands. Nice, smooth finish, but not super-stretchy and thin enough that it feels less secure in place.2. The pouch could be bigger. I'm not constricted as if wearing a jockstrap, but I would say brands like BN3TH and Saxx have pouches that are bigger and therefore better for me. If you need that kind of room to hold the boys, go those routes. If you don't, then David Archy will be fine.Everything else about these is...fine. The material is soft and stretchy and feels nice. The leg openings, despite what it says in the listing, DO roll upward, and this is after wearing literally just a few hours.For me, these will be relegated to the back of the underwear drawer and used on laundry day or maybe when I'm doing yard work or doing a light workout and want a little support but not wearing actual athletic clothing. If my two suggestions are ever implemented in the product, I will certainly buy more.",

Impeccable. Like a perfectly executed magic trick, these undies managed to accentuate my assets while cleverly perking up any flabby distractions. It was as if they were whispering, \"Behold, the master of disguise\" (and inevitable disappointment).The grays and blue colours have an understated rich, velvety quality \u2013 making you the connoisseur of cool under your outer layers.So, if you seek an undergarment that's utilitarian, fairly priced and puts comfort above all, let your undercarriage revel in the glory of these.
