                "reviewText": "I've been wearing the white CK hip brief (with the fly) for the last few years and I love them. I wanted to see what the differences were between the hip and this classic cut though so here they are. For reference I'm 5'9\" and 145 with an athletic build.Classic: Full butt coverage. Sits just below the waist. The pouch has room right when you put them on and conforms to you throughout the day giving even more space as you wear them. Because the cut is slightly more square overall, the pouch is wider so support up front is good but it doesn't lock you into one spot. They do stretch out a little in the butt the longer you wear them because there's more material there. I think they're great under jeans and in cooler weather. Parade worthy? For sure. The caveat is the butt can get a little frumpy depending and I find myself readjusting where the classic's sit on me around the legs and butt.Hip: Cut higher on the butt and legs. Waistband sits low on the hips. The pouch is snug when I put on a fresh pair but it does stretch out a little. The pouch is narrower so it keeps things in one place well. Since there is less fabric covering the butt they don't stretch out much. I feel like these are better for shorts and summer. Parade worthy? Definitely. They stay taught and look great.Overall for me the classic's are more about comfort and the hip are more about fit. Hope that helps you guys shopping both.One last thing - color makes a difference. I also bought the same classic cut in black and they fit differently. They come out of the dryer smaller and they don't stretch out as much as the white briefs do. So keep that in mind when you pick a color.",

                "reviewText": "I've bought CK briefs for awhile now and I've bought different colors from this vendor. I find the grey ones are made the best. The black ones were ok but they fell apart after about 6 months to a year. The fabric would pull away from the waistband. I also found the black ones to be smaller than the white ones. But so far the grey ones are holding up nicely. I'm not sure if these are official CK products but they're decent. I will say I feel like the pouch isn't as large as they used to be. If you're well-endowed these might not be the ones for you. But I think avg sized guys will fit nicely. The positive thing is these are 100% cotton which is becoming difficult to find anymore.",

                "reviewText": "From my teens until most of my adulthood, I only wore the classic CK briefs. They were great quality and looked amazing. While the originals are no longer available, these are a welcome return to the CK brand. The colored waistbands are very stylish, they fit perfectly, and although I have only washed them once, I noticed minimal shrinkage (I am referring to the underwear). Not inexpensive, but very happy with these briefs.As for the overwhelming criticism about the tags, I agree they are very long and numerous tags are a bit puzzling, but it says they should be snipped with scissors. The remaining stitch with the size on it can stay and is not at all irritating. It's not a big deal at all.Very pleased with this purchase - also super fast shipping. And best of all, my sex life has improved like you would not believe! Thank you, Calvin!",
