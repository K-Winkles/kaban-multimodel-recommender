                "reviewText": "Bought these for light hiking and snow blowing the property. Ordered an XL so they would fit me length wise and waist wise (33-34\" inseam) they're a teeny bit shorter than I expected, a little baggy on the calves and thighs but a bit tight at the waist. Which is weird. I'm not as slim as I used to be, but I have large, muscular legs and an average waist(35-36in pants). For the waist to be tight and the legs to be a little roomy is very, very uncommon especially for base layers. I almost always have a loose waist and tights because of the size and length.That being said, they're fine enough. I'm not doing yoga in them. I can bend over and stretch and crouch down all fine with little to no restriction in movement. I would say my biggest gripe is them being called midweight advertised for pretty cold temps and they're more light-to-mid weight. I wouldn't use them for a trip in the snow for more than maybe 2 hour or so at a time. I'd use them if I worked outside and made frequent trips in doors or inside of a vehicle. But I wouldn't use them to sit in a blind and hunt for 8 hours. Which I think is fair considering their price point. I'd recommend preparing to order and return at least one pair to get the sizing right. Other than that, not too bad. I like them and continue to wear them.",
