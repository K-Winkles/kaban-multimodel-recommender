                "reviewText": "They were great when I first bought them - perfectly smooth and comfy without a digging band. But after 4 washes (yes I wash delicates delicately) they fell apart. I mean it\u2019s worth repurchasing at least one more time because idk maybe I had a bad batch? But would love to not have these fall apart every monthUPDATE: I bought these a third time because I literally cannot beat how comfortable, sleek, and smoothing they are. My second pack seemed more durable but my third one has actually lasted without the elastic coming apart. I do go out of my way to hand wash and line dry because I just love these so much. I would recommend straying from the instructions and avoid machine washing these if you are looking for durability and don\u2019t mind the small inconvenience.THESE ARE DEFINITELY NOT GOOD TO DONATE.I know these end up on a lot of donation lists for different causes, but I would note that they require a more \u201cdelicate\u201d hand unfortunately and would not work for more rugged wash & wear.TLDR : Comfort and price worth it. You should consider hand wash and line dry if it\u2019s worth it to you. Would absolutely repurchase.",

                "reviewText": "I love the fit, comfort, and texture of these underwear but am pretty disappointed with the durability. A few of the elastic bands we already coming apart when I got these and since probably every since pair has a small tear. It\u2019s sad because I really love these. As a plus size woman it\u2019s hard to find underwear that fit and don\u2019t roll down under my belly, so I\u2019m sad these probably won\u2019t last long. But they aren\u2019t too expensive so I could see myself reordering regularly until I find something better.",
