For the longest time, I just didn\u2019t know any better\u2026 just that I didn\u2019t want to wear man panties.With other boxers and boxer briefs, sometimes I find myself ripping them right off in my sleep\u2026 other times just riding up my back crease. During the summer it seems they take my dangly bits to a Turkish bath with them. I\u2019ve always thought, I\u2019m just a bit warmer now that I\u2019ve gained 40lbs onto my once youthful fit body.Enter \u201cCool Boxers\u201d\u2026 the day my nether regions changed forever. I actually purchased a couple of the Jockeys RapidCool and a couple of the \u201cproduce section verity\u201d\u2026 \u201cCoolZone\u201d. The Jockeys were considerably more expensive.. but had excellent reviews with long time users claiming they were the bee\u2019s knees.Overall, with what limited use I have, I can say that both brands are very comparable. The Jockeys seem a little bit better quality, but both aerate my business area sufficiently and provide similar amounts of groin comfort\u2026 so much so that I enjoy sleeping in them.I\u2019ll be replacing the rest of my man undergarments with a variety of these two brands. Either way I see it, you can\u2019t go wrong. Also, sizing seems to be accurate.",
