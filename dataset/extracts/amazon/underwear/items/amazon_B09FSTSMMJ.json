I ordered a few different varieties and I swear these are the best underwear by far that I've had ever. They are stretchy enough to accommodate things but they don't get weird and baggy. The cut fits comfortably on my leg and stomach and I can tuck the ostomy bag in or wear it out with these. They allow for movement without riding up or slipping down. I love them so much I am replacing all my everyday underwear with them. There's no weird waist band and the material is nice and thick. They also washed well but shrank just a little in the dryer. It you are looking for comfortable underwear you can move in and that can accommodate bloated days and normal days these are great and I totally think they are worth it.",

I have had SO much trouble finding panties that I don\u2019t want to throw out by the end of a workday. Til these!Other panties: If they fit my bottom and thighs they\u2019re a nightmare on my belly; they either roll down, or they compress my gut in an extremely uncomfortable way. If they fit my belly the leg holes flap around in a very irritating way. Yuck.THESE panties are like a hug! They fit everywhere! The leg holes don\u2019t gap, the waistband stays up, and they feel like they\u2019re gently containing my belly jiggles but not ever compressing to the point of GI distress.10 stars. Love.",

                "reviewText": "...women of a certain age will know what I am talking about.Back in the 'olden days' little girls started with cotton briefs (aka granny panties).Comfortable, cotton, inexpensive served their purpose perfectly--and were most likely all that was available in the aforementioned 'olden days'.Continued to buy this style for decades. Different brands, but all cotton briefs.I like them. Dependable, comfortable, familiar and easy to find (up to a certain size).Many years later, (after I had starved my 5'8\" self down to 126lbs) a woman young enough to be my daughter suggested I try hipsters--sexier, cuter, wouldn't show at waistline (mine didn't anyway but she was trying to be helpful).I have always struggled with my weight, so accentuating my hips wasn't anything I ever wanted to do, butsince I was now skinny, I tried them. They were okay, but never really comfortable, I missed my grannies!With the passage of time and circumstrances, I started to gain weight again.Hipsters were becoming very uncomfortable, and gave me extra bumps and bulges at the hipline--ugh!I had to keep buying bigger panties: From 2016 to 2024, I have accumulated a vast collection of 7s, 8s, 10s and now 3X.NONE of them were ever as comfortable as Molasus briefs.So glad I found these, and as I continue to lose weight again from my now 5'7\"/198lb frame (working very hard at it) I plan to buy more of these in descending sizes.Sexy undies for certain occasions may be okay, but since I have attained the age where comfort means a whole lot more than 'sexy' panties no one ever sees.",

Well let me tell you the fit was terrible and the bands cut in so uncomfortably, especially after a c-section. Then I bought another pack, and another, and still no luck and lots of discomfort. I was instead living in disposables but knew that couldn\u2019t last forever!Finally I found these and let me tell you, game changer!!! These panties are soooo comfortable. The extra wide waist band is super stretchy and doesn\u2019t cut in to your postpartum tummy. They are the perfect high-waisted cut so won\u2019t interfere with c-section recovery. Plus they are surprisingly flattering, I really love how they look and feel. I would definitely buy again and will wear these well past the postpartum stage!True to size with the sizing chart, I bought a large and they\u2019ve comfortably stretched to fit when my tummy was larger, and now as it\u2019s shrunk down a bit.",
