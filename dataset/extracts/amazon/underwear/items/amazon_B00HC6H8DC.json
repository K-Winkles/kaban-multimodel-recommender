                "reviewText": "I figured I ought to provide a review, something I'm not prone to doing even though I often/always bank my purchases on item reviews, since I just bought me a second set of these underwear because they're just that good!I bought my 1st set of these 2 months ago because I was on the hunt for some new comfortable underwear and omfort was my main criteria. Wasn't aware that I was dealing with some health issues that was causing a fair bit of internal inflammation, just knew that I had had enough of basically everything I had at the time because they were old, ratty looking and even my all-time favorites had begun feeling too... something... not exactly too tight, yet they just weren't very comfortable anymore either and I didn't need that kind of extra stress in my life. But. I'm a barely-makin-it domestic violence survivor.Sure, I'm super proud to have gotten as far as I have in this world (considering that post-separation psychological terrorism and torture continue to thus day, 5 years after I broke free) but, by rights and family-rearing, I should be living in a whole different world right now... which is my way of saying that money is extra, EXTRA tight in my house...and yet, I still have \"caviar tastes\", ifykwim. Lol. And, frankly, neither I nor anyone else should have to scrimp on comfortable, classy-feeling, fashionable clothing no matter how small our clothing budget may be.I was spurred to check out boxer briefs for women after reading about a few different women's favorite brands in the comments on soneones IG post (that must have been in regards to underwear, but heck if I can remember the details). So, off I went to scout around on Amazon to see what this \"boxer briefs\" business was about... desperately hoping that the term was not just a rebranding of those \"hipsters\" things.I am 46yo, 5'10\" (potentially closer to 5'11\"... not something I care enough about to know for certain, lol) and, clothing size-wise, my whole adult life I have consistently been a 16-18/18-20, top to bottom, with a shape that seems some what apple-ish at the moment but has, in general, always been more hourglass than apple. Also it seems as if I might have rather freakishly high hips, lol... not really, but for reference, when it comes to pants or jeans what generally passes as \"tall\", usually a 33\"-34\" inseem, fit like ankle or cigar length pants on me. But evidently I don't just have long legs, no, this momma's body seems to also have one heck of a long, tall pelvis which I did finally measure to figure out for sure but, prior to that, I could tell based on the way that low cut underwear like bikini & hipsters, and any form of low rise pants, barely make it north of my low lying c-section scar location which, for those who can't relate, is basically at the top of my hooha or just at the point where my belly and my hooha meet. And because that point on my body is not even remotely close to my \"hip\" area such items basically fall right off my body unless they're super stretchy and I deliberately hike them up to my hip area which I put up with in my 20s and 30s, for the sake of fashion I suppose, but which was and is quite ungodly uncomfortable, and... basically... I am so over with \"uncomfortable\" anything (men included, lol.)In both cases I bought size 11, though, if I'm being honest, I am certain that a 10 would have fit well, too. And who knows, a 10 might have been just as comfortable or even more comfortable than the 11... but, I didn't take bother taking the chance to find out when I ordered my second set because the first set (size 11) made me so unbelievably happy that they literally changed my views about underwear for life.This whole \"pants come off after work\" thing or the memes about people working from home (due to covid restrictions) and not wearing pants never jived with me prior to having these boxer briefs, but now... omg... these things are super inexpensive and somehow still suit my somewhat \"caviar taste\" perfectly (have a good handfeel and are just so unbelievably super comfortable), PLUS... they're opaque and they basically fit (and look) like I'm wearing a loungy pair of bike shorts, so... yeah, I've spent some time over the last 2 months actually chillin in my house in my freaking underwear!!!!Life. Changing. :D",

In fact, I'm still wearing my old ones 2 years later, and even with shrinkage from laundering, they are still in excellent condition and still fit comfortably. But THIS one? Even though they are the identical brand, style and supposed size, they are NOT size 13! They are tight on me. They have to be size 10 or 11. If you place the new over the old, you can see the visible size difference. And they are not as soft as the ones I bought previously. This is not the fault of the seller. The seller delivered as promised, and promptly. The product is brand name and new. Perhaps the difference is in the manufacturing source (a company in Bangladesh). I totally wasted my money.",
