That's what so great about them. They never get in the way, they never cause discomfort, it is like they aren't even there, except, they are more comfortable then if you had no underwear on.I can't recommend these enough.They are pricey, and I have a hard time coughing up the cash for underwear, but I will probably be wearing these for the rest of my life I love them so much.I've been buying the give-n-go boxer (1.0) from Exeficio for years, probably at least 1.5 decades, and they last really well too.The give-n-go 2.0 is even softer and more comfy than the 1.0. Who knew you could improve on perfection.If there was ever a perfect boxer, I think this is it.",
