They are as always good quality and do last very well. Now for the negative, all my own fault I must say. I saw 'full rise' in the blurb, being that he is traditional, I assumed that meant to the waist!!! Well, he is 6'4\", the full rise came almost up to his arm pits, it caused loads of laughs but I washed them, put them in the tumble dryer on a hot heat. They shrunk enough to be wearable, a bit higher than his usual ones and the vital bits were well-contained - if that is not too much information",
