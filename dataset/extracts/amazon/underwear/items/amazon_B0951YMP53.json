Coming with a mesh structure that's highly breathable, lightweight and extremely good at wicking away moisture, wearing them just feels like wearing nothing. Plus, the time-perfected craftsmanship of our designers makes sure there's no riding up or falling down or digging into your sacred ravines in the front and back.",
            "(Seamless Versatility) Sick and tired of that brazen pantie line hinting at your secret, turning people's heads, and rendering an entire carefully selected outfit invisible? With these panties, that embarrassment just disappears. Crafted with latest sewing techniques, we have successfully made these panties seamless and the most non-picky underwear that goes with any of your outfits.",

A piece of high-quality, comfy and breathable underwear that speaks to your personality will give you extra power in your daily life as a power woman. Whether you are part of the business elite whose heart is set on sheer black or a housewife who prefers an assortment of basic shades, or a party girl whose verve cannot be represented except by the leopard skin...,we have that exact color for you."

                "reviewText": "These are hands down the most comfortable underwear EVER! It\u2019s the kind of comfortable that makes you forget you\u2019re even wearing underwear- no digging or pinching or sliding around! The breathable lightweight fabric keeps sweat to a minimum for working out and, despite not being a thong, you can barely see any kind of panty line- you have to really look to see it! Plus I appreciate that they offer the size xs; I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d around 103lbs and a size 00-0 so it makes finding underwear that fits well pretty hard. But these fit great! They are not snug and could probably even be a little tighter and still be fine so I\u2019d say they might run a little large but definitely not by much! I feel like every woman needs these! They offer 3 different cuts of underwear and I bought all three kinds and love them all and plan to get some different colors. Because I kind of want to throw away all other underwear and only wear these. Because they are AMAZING! I love hiking, walking, and just being active and these are perfect for that but are just as comfortable for lazy PJ days too! All around AMAZING!BOTTOM LINE (pun intended): HIGHLY recommend. Don\u2019t hesitate, just click buy now!",
