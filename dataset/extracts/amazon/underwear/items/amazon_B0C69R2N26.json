These definitely check the boxes. They are very comfortable and seem to hold their shape well through washes (I machine wash, hang dry). I ignored other reviews that suggested ordering a size up and went for my true size and I'm so glad I did. They are a perfect fit! My suggestion is, know your size and order that. These are soft, breathable and the lace isn't rigid like some other types I've tried. They're invisible under my yoga pants and leggings and my husband loves them. Definitely a winner!",

                "reviewText": "These are exactly what I was looking for. The material is super comfortable, soft and stretchy. They\u2019re super cute and also have great coverage! My favorite thing about these though, is the band around the edges. They\u2019ve still got that almost feel, but the band helps them not roll up/down like normal seamless underwear. I\u2019m 5\u20194, 220 lbs, and usually wear a 16/18 pant, and these fit perfect. They don\u2019t dig in and give that muffin top look. They look and fit exactly like the picture. Would definitely recommend.",
