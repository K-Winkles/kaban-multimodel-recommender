I'm 180 Ibs and got a size large. BUT I'm am a bit disappointed at the quality of mine because the seams along the thong area are falling apart and ripping after just one wash on gentle cycle. Not happy about that but it is hard to find good fitting underwear. So will continue to wear until they completely fall apart.",

High enough coverage in front to cover my C-section bulge and scar, which gets super irritated if I don't wear panties with soft fabric and a high waist. I thought my days of wearing thongs were over (not the end of the world) but I do prefer the way my bum looks in jeans when I wear a thong. I was ready to give up when I tried these and I'm very satisfied. I almost bought a size medium and think M may have bee fine too. But Amazon suggested Small and they fit comfortably. Good product for the price and perfect for what I was looking for.",

                "reviewText": "Fit well, does not show under clothes. Soft stretchy fabric, not too tight. I usually avoid thongs because the crotch is too narrow. Many other reviews said these panties have a wider crotch and I found that to be true. The crotch covers completely and does not dig into places it shouldn't. Consult the size chart and order according to the width of your hips on the size chart. (The chart says size small is 23.5 inch waist and 38-40 inch hips. Somebody's fantasy but for me, these panties fit standard waist to hip ratio) I usually wear medium/size 6. Size chart indicated I should order small and the small fits perfectly (5ft 3 in, 125lbs). Some reviewers complained that the panties they received were not seamless. Apparently everyone does not get the same package. The ones I received are seamless and tag free. The crotch certainly is wider than any other pair of thongs I have previously purchased.",
