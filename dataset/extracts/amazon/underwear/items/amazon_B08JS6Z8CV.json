You'll love that these smoothing cotton hipsters have a ComfortSoft\u00ae cotton-covered waistband that won't pinch or bind. The silhouette is a hybrid with the low-rise waist of a bikini and the moderate back coverage of a brief, plus wider sides that sit at the hips. This lightweight underwear is wonderfully soft against your skin and super comfortable with leg bands that stay in place without riding up. Even better, they are tag-free for itch-free comfort.",

I ordered some of the classic cotton ones I think they're going to go right back and I'm going to order myself some more of these because the One reviewer was right it does feel like you're wearing nothing! Just get a size up because they shrink down a whole size. Otherwise they're fantastic nicest most comfortable panties I've ever worn! The fact that they're organic is even better!",
