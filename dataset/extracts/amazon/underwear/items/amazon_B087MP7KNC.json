I have owned this brand of underwear for perhaps a decade or so, and I have many in my draw that I still use. I say this as someone who has a habit of shopping for clothes fairly often and prefers new over old in just about everything. Yet I don\u2019t see much wear and tear on these, save for some modest stretching of the waistband that was many years in the making. They still fit well, however. The fit is a key feature of these underwear. They keep your parts in place, which for today\u2019s flat pants is important, especially if it is a suit. I wear these especially with those pants because they almost act like a cup, yet in a soft comfortable way. They never ride up the leg, something the brand doesn\u2019t brag about. Buy these and in 5 years there will be 15 million Americans born before you even think about tossing them.",
