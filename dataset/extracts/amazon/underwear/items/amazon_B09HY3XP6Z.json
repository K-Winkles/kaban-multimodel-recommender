Very quality construction, looked nice, but when I put them on, it went downhill fast.The seam for the leak protection part is much larger than what I expected and the online photos didn\u2019t show that structure (I\u2019ve purchased $$$ name brand others before). The problem is that it\u2019s sewn all across the back area. I felt the seam - ALL DAY LONG. Sitting, walking, standing, it didn\u2019t matter. I think it may even have been visible in my closer-fitting dress pants, and it was towards the bottom of the cheek curve (felt like underwear had fallen down). Couldn\u2019t wait to get home and change out of them.I doubt I\u2019ll ever wear these again, they were that bad. Very disappointed.",

Many have no elastic on the legs which caused gaps. Some are too low, or too high and I don't like the feeling of briefs. These are perfect! And the price is right! And they are very pretty! I haven't yet had an accident, but only have small leaks when coughing or sneezing anyway. After I ordered the first one, I ordered 3 more. I only need to e=were them when I go out.",
