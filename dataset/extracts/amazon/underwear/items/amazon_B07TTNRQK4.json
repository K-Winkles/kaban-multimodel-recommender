                "reviewText": "I've been wearing a couple of versions of Champion boxer briefs for several years and have loved them (the first ones I got were C9 branded). A frustration I have with champion is that they have so many similar sounding products, it is hard to tell the differences. This looked the same as what I've had in the past; all polyester (I don't want any cotton). When I got them two things stood out; the feel of the fabric was different, felt somehow flimsier, and the 3\" paper tag stitched in the back; none of the previous ones have had that. I was able to rip it out easy enough. I went ahead and tried them on and the fit on the legs was much tighter than other Champion boxer briefs I've had in the past; previous ones had been hardly noticeable when wearing them. The most frustrating thing was that I ordered these to replace some I've had for a while, and the old ones by the end of the day were not really holding things in place so well. Surprisingly, even though these felt tighter than ones I had bought in the past, by the end of the day these were not holding things in place so well either! They are now just emergency backups.",

                "reviewText": "I was dissapointed that these are not the same tek performance boxer briefs one used to be able to find at target. The c9 style has a much tighter leg - you might want to consider buying the next largest size as they are very constricting. They have also reduced the area for the banana hammock in half roughly. Hard for a true man to fit into these now.On the us side, the legs do not ride up which is one of the reasons I loved the old champion tek performance boxer briefs. I think those good days are gone for good.",

                "reviewText": "I've been purchasing these boxer briefs for more than a decade now and have owned more than 20 pairs over that time. These used to be available at Target, but I guess \"Champion\" lost that contract.In all truth, I've been a little disappointed over the last year or so since I haven't been able to find these in any big box retail store. I was surprised and excited to see these were being offered through Amazon. I will be purchasing more soon.On average, I probably get at least 8 to 10 years or more use out of each pair. Having said that, I typically rotate through quite a few pairs so it's not like I'm washing any one pair more often than once every week or two.",
