They are cotton- which is apparently great for men and sperm counts- is better compared to synthetic fabrics but still has some stretch. I think these look good on and accentual all the things any guy could ask for. However the sizing is little off and very different then normal Jockey sizing compared to all of there other underwear I've ever purchased. For example normally I would state buy one size larger than you normally would bc then it will fit perfect and that's just a Jockey thing. I did that with these and they are actually a iittle large. Not enough to not wear them or feel bulky but I think if I had just bought the large instead of a extra large, they would fit a little snugger.",
