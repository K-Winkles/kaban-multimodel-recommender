The lace is also strong enough to remain in perfect shape but is not scratchy. I like a full back coverage but not a grandma look. I bought these in black and they look sexyish and are mid rise and full back coverage. Also there is a slight elasticity in the fabric that keeps them snug so they haven\u2019t lost shape. The snugness is nicely comfortable, no pinching. My 12 year old daughter saw these when I bought them and liked them so much we bought more for her in size L. We replaced our whole drawer with only these.",

                "reviewText": "Never thought I would be one to post body pics online but hey these are fantastic okay! Alright for reference I\u2019m about 5\u20197\u201d and 220lbs size14-18 in jeans I ordered an XXL I work a physically demanding job and needed some new underwear that wouldn\u2019t ride up, fall down or any other annoy things that underwear LOVE to do. I\u2019ve been wearing Torrid underwear for the last 5ish years and the one I loved from them are on their last leg and the new one from them are worse quality inconsistent cuts, expensive and in my HUMBLE opinion just ugly. I shopped around for a bit before deciding on these, and I\u2019m beyond happy I did. These are a stretch lace for the top \u2018band\u2019 so no strong elastic to cut into the hips. Super consistent cut, all of them fit the exact same. But my favorite part is the gusset/bit between your legs its super wide, and comfortable! I get so fed up with all these cute underwear companies cutting the gusset really thin, I\u2019m sure it works for some people but I just want the underwear to tuck into the crease of my leg and stay there, these do! I\u2019m apple shaped so I can\u2019t really speak fully on the elastic cutting into thick thighs but these don\u2019t cut into my legs whatsoever. Overall you can say I am throughly impressed and I will be ordering more of these in the future. Also all black!? Chefs kiss perfection!!EDIT Jan 2022- I did repurchase these in October of 2021, because I realized I was reaching for these everyday. When I ran out of pairs before laundry day I was bummed. So I have basically tossed all my old pairs and these are filling my closet. The original set I bought in may of 2021 and they are still going strong, lace is intact, no random holes where the stitching was done badly, nothing. As someone who loves consistency in their clothing these are my dream underwear. My weight has fluctuated by about 20 pounds and these still fit like a dream. Truly if these are the style of underwear you like I say give them a shot they are my ride or dies!",

Full butt coverage. Not the worst panty lines either, for being full-backs! The gusset is wide enough for my body type, unlike most tiny gussets. I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d 155lbs and the M fit me perfectly. For reference, I don\u2019t have a ton of butt, average, but I do have a thicker belly. The lace is a nice touch and despite being as comfy as a granny panty, they don\u2019t look like them! The black cotton is colourfast and I air dry them, so I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019d shrink in the dryer. I actually look forward to wearing these every day. Very much recommended!",
