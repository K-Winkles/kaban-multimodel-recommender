They were itchy, and they do not grip your midsection as well as you want them to grip your midsection like the ones that I purchased from Kohl\u2019s. Otherwise for the 3 in a pack and the colors I would recommend them for pants wearing or legging\u2019s. They did not provide the full support a coupled felt better and firm and most of the underwear did not fit as well. I will order them again in a medium, maybe the large was too big. In my case I thought if I got them large, they would be beneficial for me when I really should\u2019ve gotten a medium because I had purchase a medium from Kohl\u2019s, but then again it\u2019s still a different feel compare to Kohl\u2019s they were not as smooth and comforting as the store brand. I want to assume I received a bad line. I know I will order another pack\u2026.",
