                "reviewText": "This is a review of the 3 pack No-Show seamless underwear, and not the other style options which I have tried and do show under leggings.I have tried about 20 different styles of undies over the years looking for a true no-show panty, and this is the only one that is truly no-show. There are zero seams except in the back, and that one seam lines up perfectly with your pant seam. I put on my tightest leggings and bent over and they are truly invisible. It's a very soft cotton and very comfy. Pads stay put on this fabric. I would definitely follow the washing instructions as there is no edging along the leg holes and if the cotton starts to curl or become misshapen they might become visible.Amazing product. True to size.",
