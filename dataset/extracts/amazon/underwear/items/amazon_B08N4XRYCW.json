Jockeys will last forever but they're kind of pricey. These are up there alongside jockey as far as comfort for me. No exposed elastic which really irritates my skin. I have large legs and the leg holes are perfect - not tight. These have great stretch to them while still maintaining the comfort of cotton.",

They fit perfect and make my bottom look so nice in my leggings. In my height waisted jeans, even better. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking before, but these are absolutely perfect if you are on the bigger size in life. I bought them in the XL as i am a woman with hips and backsides. For reference I\u2019m 5,6 210lb and wear a size 12-14. And the XL fits like a dream. Doesn\u2019t cause any rolls in the tummy area and is seamless at the things.",
