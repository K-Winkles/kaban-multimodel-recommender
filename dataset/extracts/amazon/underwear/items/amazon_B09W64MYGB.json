They certainly feel baggy. I might just gift it to a friend or family member who will fit it. I gave it 5 stars \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f because I feel it fits true to size, and it feels like a great all around dickies product. I should\u2019ve ordered a men\u2019s large like I was originally thinking. Oh well maybe next winter I\u2019ll order a size down. I can\u2019t add much more to my review. Hope it helps others \u270c\ud83c\udffd\u270c\ud83c\udffd\u270c\ud83c\udffd",
