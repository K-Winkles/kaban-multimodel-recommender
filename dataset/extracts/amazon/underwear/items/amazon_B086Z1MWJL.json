They come in a variety of styles and colors, so I can choose the ones that suit my mood and outfit. They are also durable and easy to wash, and they don't shrink or fade. They are very comfortable and do not ride up or dig in. They have a tag-free design and a 100% cotton liner that keep me fresh and cool. They are also affordable and have a 100% satisfaction guarantee. I think Fruit of loom Women's panties are the best underwear for women. They make me feel confident and happy. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for quality, comfort, and value.",

                "reviewText": "These undies are okay \u2014 I\u2019m happy with the colors and the quality and the fit. One star off because I don\u2019t like the way the waistband elastic grips \u2014 it\u2019s a bit itchy and it leaves indentation marks around the waist. So I bought a different style of Fruit of the Looms that don\u2019t have that issue. I\u2019ll keep these drawers in the drawer as my \u201cback-up\u201d underwear \u2014 the quality, colors and fit are nice.",
