                "reviewText": "I bought some of these previously from a nearby store and they quickly became my favorite undies. The fabric is SO soft on your skin, and the fitting was perfect. In the original sets I purchased there were no quitter elastic bands here, these things are wonderful and stay on well, and they don't become loose or misshapen from all the laundry cycles, nor do they shrink.Well, I just bought four packs off Amazon, excited to bring more of these soft undies into my collection and rotate old undies out. Except, these are MUCH smaller than the other ones I already own, which is really strange. You can see the printed information on the inside of the underwear, same size and everything lines up. Then why do I feel like a blood sausage when wearing them? Side by side these new ones are considerably smaller.I am being squeezed by them so badly that my hips feel pinched and uncomfortable as the fabric shifts lower during wear (constantly, despite my tugging back up). The front rides even lower on my abdomen and the thick waist band does not hold them up very well. I am not sure why they changed their template and the amount of fabric they use for my size, but they definitely changed something. I would return them had I not washed them all and worn some. If you buy them, consider going a size up and make sure to try them on before washing in case they don't fit.",
