These panties became my favorite pair. They are so comfortable and the material is similar to Spanx so they make me feel slimmer. I immediately came to Amazon to buy more. Store only had my size, a medium and bought them. I'm short so my size came up too high on my belly, right to my belly button, and they didn't give the same slimming feel. They gave me a muffin top. So I bought another pair in a size smaller and they are perfect. Will be buying the 3 pack next.",

Original review follows: Good design and fabric. Comfortable. Fit is small for sizing given. As I noted in a previous review, small is too small in waist, fits much smaller than \"Jockey comfies\" size 5, The rest is nice. Fabric soft , colours good, body fit good. I had ordered 2 in small. So after washing and wearing, I ordered 2 in Medium. Waist loose enough but overall came up too high in waist. Felt like full panties. A bit loose in hips and seat. Also in comparison with Jockeys, the elastic waist tends to roll a bit. The wider band (elastic, not waist size) is very good and when just right eliminates Muffin top. So if this particular brand and style fits YOU well, it might be perfect. I am going back to Jockey. I will wear these, only with clothing that they suit",
