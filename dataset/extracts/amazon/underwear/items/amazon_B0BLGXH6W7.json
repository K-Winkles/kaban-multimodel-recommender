Just something to consider. They are pretty expensive but as long as they last a long time they will be worth it. So far they have held up great. Try these if you haven\u2019t. You will love them.",

If you're looking for comfort in your underwear, these are definitely it.I will caution you though, make sure you get the right size, the wrong size won't be as comfortable.
