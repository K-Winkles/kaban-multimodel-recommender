                "reviewText": "I've been buying these underwear as needed for years; probably since high school. Same size, same general variety pack, two packs at a time. It's a formula that works for me. I like having a simple, go-to underwear option without having to shop around or think about it.For the most part, these fit exactly as they're supposed to. But I've found that, in every pack, there's one random pair that's smaller than all the others, despite being tagged with all the correct dimensions. This odd pair always fits AROUND the waist correctly; it's the height of the cut that's different, falling about an inch below the rest of the pairs. In the case of this assortment, I've found that the odd pair is the darker pink ones\u2014the ones that, in the photo, are third from the top, and appear to be sort of a greyish mauve. They're not greyish mauve in person. They're definitely a dark pink, more like orchid. (The remaining pairs' colors are all correct as pictured. Black; grey; light pink; caucasian nude; bright white.)I'm not sure why this always happens in every pack (I had an odd pair in my last set, too, almost as if a pair of bikini briefs was mislabeled as regular briefs), but they aren't smaller in an uncomfortable way, just a slightly awkward way, so they still work. They're just not my favorite pairs. But again, all the others fit perfectly, as expected, so the packs are still well worth the money.The only other odd thing I've noticed is that they seem especially thin this time around. The lighter colors are literally almost sheer. You can see skin creases, etc. through them. I don't seem to remember Hanes briefs being that thin before, but because they're so comfortable, convenient, and cost-effective, it's not a dealbreaker. Even if I only get a year, year-and-a-half out of them, they'll still be worth it. That's not bad.These aren't perfect, but they're pretty damn close overall, so I'll take it. I've worn them for years and still recommend them, and whenever these do give out, I plan to keep getting more.",

Although priced far less than other good brands, these didn't hold up that well after 5 normal washing cycles in our LG washer and dryer. They're good and fine but if you're looking for panties to fall in love with and not having to replace every couple months, look elsewhere.I hope this is honest and helpful.",

The colors are nicer than they look in the package pictures (see waistband picture). The waistband picture shows the actual color, stitching and elastic in the dark blue pair so you can judge for yourself if they are for you. Reviews seemed mixed here but since they had a lot of good stars, i bought some to try. They were fine, fit great, comfy and I used them for nearly two months before buying a second set. I don\u2019t care about colors really but i prefer that some are dark and few if any are all white, so these were a bonus. I saw some reviews saying quality has dropped but these sets are the only ones of these I\u2019ve had so I can\u2019t comment on that. After about two months of wash and wear you can see in the waistband picture that my first set still look new. They seem like they\u2019ll hold up, we shall see. So far so good.",
