                "reviewText": "I bought these for my boyfriend for his birthday. He has a tiny waist (29) and the small fit perfectly- snug, not stretched. Impressed with material quality and workmanship. Thick sturdy waistband and double stitched seams have me thinking these will endure the washing machine well. These do not have a pouch, instead a two-way fly for convenience. By two-way I mean they have an opening on the inside on the left, and a second piece of fabric on the outside with an opening on the right.BF says the best part about these is their softness, they don't ride up, and they keep everything \"up and tight\" . I like the chili print. I also got him some more expensive pouch style underwear, the quality of which was really impressive. Considering that I think these are definitely worth the money spent.",
