                "reviewText": "I am really liking these undies so far. They are indeed 100% cotton. Some companies like to say a cotton blend is cotton, or make half the colors in the package a cotton blend while making the white ones 100% cotton. Not Jockey, apparently. These are ALL 100% cotton. I just love that.What others are saying about some size variations has some truth to it. I had one pair I felt was smaller and when I held it up to another, it is a bit smaller. However, they are still wearable and it isn't a massive deal to me. However, that is something to be aware of. If I hadn't gotten these during good a sale, I think I'd be upset...As things stand, I'm wanting to swap out all my other panties with these and also try the bikini cut. These hipster ones are a little \"taller\" than the ones I'm used to. That's good if you need to keep the button of your jeans from touching your skin or if you wear taller jeans. But, these are taller than what Hanes considers a hipster, just FYI.Historically, I have issues with my undies riding up and strangling me. I also tend to sweat down there, but have a job where I have to sit all day. Ugh! I like these because the cotton is soft, but seems keep me a little drier because I think it's a little thicker! The cotton in the crotch is the same as the body of panty, so you get two full layers; they didn't make the crotch liner much thinner like some do. And, the elastic does a decent job of preventing wild ride-uppage and I feel like the crotch is just more roomy to keep things circulating... It's also a little wider than I'm used to, which also helps with the sweat because it fully covers over to the legs instead of just being a constrictive \"strip.\"I'd really give these a try if you're on the fence. Or order one of these and the bikini ones to see which height you like better...Oh, as far as washing: I've washed them by the label directions and they came out perfect. They didn't disintegrate and were totally fine when I disobeyed the directions and dried them on high heat with my towels. They seem like they'll hold up well, but it's early yet.",
