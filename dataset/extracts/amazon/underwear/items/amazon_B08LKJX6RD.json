                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the FINETOO 6 Pack Women's Seamless Hipster Underwear, and I'm genuinely impressed with the comfort, fit, and quality of these panties. They have quickly become my go-to choice for daily wear, and here's why:First and foremost, the seamless design of these hipster underwear is a game-changer. They truly live up to the \"no-show\" promise, thanks to their smooth edges and absence of seams. They are virtually invisible under even the most form-fitting clothing, making them ideal for wearing with any outfit.The soft stretch fabric is incredibly comfortable against the skin. These panties offer a snug yet gentle fit that stays in place without digging or rolling down. The elastic waistband doesn't leave marks or discomfort, ensuring all-day comfort.The variety of colors in the 6-pack is a fantastic bonus. It provides options to match different outfits or moods. The XS-XL size range means there's a fit for every body type.The quality and durability of these panties are impressive. They have held up well through numerous washes, maintaining their shape and elasticity. I appreciate that they remain soft and comfortable even after repeated wear.One thing to note is that the sizing runs slightly small, so it's advisable to order a size up if you're in between sizes.In conclusion, FINETOO's 6 Pack Women's Seamless Hipster Underwear is a fantastic value for the quality and comfort they offer. Their seamless design, soft stretch fabric, and variety of colors make them a top-notch choice for everyday wear.

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Women's Seamless Hipster Underwear and wanted to share my thoughts.Firstly, I should note that I am 5'2 and weigh 110 lbs. I ordered a size small, but unfortunately, I found it to be a bit too big for me. In hindsight, I believe an extra-small would have been a better fit. So, if you're similar in size to me, I would recommend considering a smaller size option.Despite the sizing issue, there are several positive aspects to these underwear. The colors are vibrant and appealing, which adds a fun touch to my undergarment collection. Additionally, the underwear washes well and maintains its color and shape even after multiple washes, which is always a plus.One feature that I appreciate is that these hipster underwear are tagless. This eliminates any potential discomfort or irritation that tags can sometimes cause. It's a small but noteworthy detail that contributes to the overall comfort of the underwear. They also have a good stretch. I may even need an xxs.In terms of coverage, I found that the cut of these hipster underwear provides ample coverage for the bottom area. They fit comfortably and don't ride up or shift throughout the day, which is important for all-day comfort.Cleaning these underwear is a breeze as well. They are easy to clean and dry quickly, which is convenient for everyday use.",

I bought these because they were a great deal and had good reviews. I am hoping to get back in shape and did not want to spend a lot of money on fancy underwear that would not fit in a few months. If I end up losing weight, I will probably order these in a size down. They are very comfortable and do NOT show any lines when wearing leggings or skirts. The fabric is breathable and stays put (not constantly sliding down). Would definitely recommend this product.",
