                "reviewText": "First Apologies for the longer review, but this will cover many of the questions many plus sized folks have when buying underwear sight unseen, many which are never addressed in oroduct descriptions or reviews.I am a plus sized woman with Lipedema which is a fat disorder (that doesn't respond to fitness or diet and is hereditary) that makes my lower body abnormally large. Because of this, finding clothing is a nightmare, ESPECIALLY underwear. I buy in packs because the cost of single pairs that may or may not fit is prohibitively expensive for me. I have bought packs of underwear at many stores and I get this weird phenomenon of 2 or 3 pairs fitting and the remaining 3 dont fit (who knows why this occurs?!)Seeing this package of underwear, honestly, I had very little hope or expectation of good quality or the dreaded 3 out of 5 or 6 pairs not fitting syndrome not occuring. Boy was I shocked!First the package was discreet which is nice. I don't need the entire world seeing my big ole underpants! It was on time and I appreciate that. When I opened it I looked at the quality of the fabric and it seems to be quite good. There is an extra panty pocket layer in there that is breathable and comfortable. The stitching was good and not crappy like many brands. The fabric itself felt nice and smooth. I washed them and tried them on. EVERY PAIR FITS!!!!! NOT EVEN ONE HAD THE PROBLEM I SPOKE OF ABOVE!!! So right away that makes it worth the money.The fabric still felt so soft and smooth I was happy. I have sensory issues that sometimes make fabrics feel like torture. This didn't trigger that and there is no labels to cut out. Thats nice too. Pads stick well to the panty layer, which is helpful if you need pantiliners, period pads or incontinence pads! Anyone who does knows some underwear won't take the stick and then you get bunching. Not with these!The styles were cute too. I got polka dots, stripes, a cute pattern and some solids. I appreciate that in plus sized underwear. After all we want to feel sexy and beautiful too and these, although packaged bulk undies, does that.As for sizing, 5x works for me but they are very stretchy material so I will buy 4x too as my size fluctuates based on fluid retention. They run pretty true to size and the size chart provided on this site was helpful. I appreciate that they did not cut into my very large legs and hips, as many plus sized underwear brands tended to be too tight even the 5x, on the leg holes. Also many brands, I have had them fit but then they dont cover my whole booty, so my crack hangs out and thats not okay. These give me full coverage! So if you have very large legs, butt, and hips this will fit well and without pain so long as you follow the chart.All in all these are great and I wil buy again! 5 stars for sure!",

                "reviewText": "I am a very, VERY plus size woman. My entire life has been filled with trying to find comfortable panties, that don't look like my great grandmother bought them, and don't murder my wallet in it's sleep. My dream panties would be all black (no white, no variety packs with prints), with no white panty liner, and that actually fit me. You wouldn't think that's asking too too much, and yet...Despite all my other clothes still fitting, the size 13 panties from Hanes/JustMySize/FruioftheLoom seemed like they were shrinking more and more any time I bought a new pack (the quality also starting to really decline too). Ok, moved to the few 14 types they offer, and they felt smaller than the 13's! (I'm a size US26/28 in tops, and US30 in bottoms.) As buying went on and they just kept getting worse, I was getting very frustrated. The styles in these sizes offered by the bigger name brands are also ugly as he11. I do not want all white panties, those are the worst of the worst, but then the patterns are all flowers or stripes, and the fabric can be terrible. Either non-breathing mesh, or cotton so un-stretchy and rough that they legit hurt to wear. I also refuse to pay $35+ for a single pair of panties, so I wasn't going to move to places like Avenue/Lane Bryan to buy them all. I just can't afford that, nor mentally cope with spending that much a single article of clothing, that no one but myself and my husband will ever see.So, on Black Friday I stumbled upon these. I didn't even know Amazon had these from their brand. I immediately bought a pack of 5x and a second in 6X based on the reviews I saw, I wanted to make sure they fit. The 6x's got here first, and were verrrrry comfortable. However, the 6X were just a tad baggy in the lower butt section, I still love them and use those for sleeping, but just a little baggy in the under butt area.When the 5x's got here, they were bloody perfect. Fit is SO nice and comfortable. The fabric is ultra soft and super stretchy, it doesn't cut in you half along the waist band or rub your skin into irritation, they are ALL black, through and through, and the price is really nice. I went back and bought 2 more 5x's, and I'm considering buying a few more and just replacing all of my current ones. No lie. I'm in love with these. First time ever (in non-lingerie specific panties) I actually feel like they could be sexy, so I felt sexy. That's RARE. I'm super happy, and super comfortable sitting here, typing this up while wearing a pair. :D",

                "reviewText": "These are very thin cotton so I'm not sure how these will hold up over time, but I don't mind because I tend to run hot. They have a lot of stretch to them, but they are a bit loose fitting- I wish I had gone down a size, but I don't want a tight fit either. I like the stretchy satin elastic trim on the edges- it's soft and narrow (I hate the typical wide trim). I like that they hit just below my belly button and have great front coverage. The leg opening is truly high-cut, though I would have preferred just a bit higher. The back coverage is generous, which I don't like. I don't find it flattering and I don't need my whole butt covered. I do like how high the back rise is. It's generous and comfortable without being too high. These panties stay put throughout activity and I never have to adjust them. Overall, they're pretty good, so try them. May want to listen to the \"go down a size \" reviews.",

I usually wear a 7/8 and I purchased the L and they fit just right!",
