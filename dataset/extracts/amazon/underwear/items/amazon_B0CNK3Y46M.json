                "reviewText": "Love these 'boxer-briefs'. I lead an active life style, and the boys can get in the way. Well, these do that job, and keep everything cool with the mesh in all the right places. Moreover, I don't know if you are sassy, but I'm kinda like that, and I appreciate all the styles and colours. Gives me a certain pick me up to look at my drawers and say, yup, you all that and a bowl of grits. Anyway, they are underwear, expensive underwear. They last a long time if you treat them right, like no fits of passions .... and they do what they are supposed to do. I've ridden 1700 kms on these in a month, returned home, and bought 5 pair more cause I hope they don't ever stop producing them ... although, in the future ... one can only imagine the neither region maintenance available to all us mobile folk!",

Recently I prefer solid support and good breathability - Active Mesh definitely delivers. Those who prefer looser fit should be warned - this kind of briefs is tighter than regular ones, even other Jockey briefs. The mesh section may scare some when examined in hand - it creates impression that everything will be showing through it. Actually, the mesh is positioned so that nothing critical is visible. Will be buying more online - when checked brick-and-mortar store, all bigger sizes were sold out.",

                "reviewText": "One would think that this fabric may be tight and/or hot, not a \"breathable\" fabric. In my opinion it is better than cotton for those hot, humid summer days in Florida when thigh chafing can be a real pain. Baby powder and Gold Bond can only soak up so much perspiration. This fabric does breathe as well as slides over itself so as to prevent the sweaty thighs and \"undercarriage\" to rub around to cause a rash. A colleague much larger than myself recommended this product and I followed his advice. Glad I did. Costs more than cotton underwear but it is worth it for the comfort factor alone.",
