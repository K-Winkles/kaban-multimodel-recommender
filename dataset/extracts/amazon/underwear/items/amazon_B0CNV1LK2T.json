Well made and packaged in this set of five colors, they are a good deal, which you can only beat when you get the free coupon in the mail for a free pair.Remember when ordering that the Pink brand is for juriors sizing, so Medium is not the same as a women's Medium.My wife washed them and they came out as expected.BOTTOM LINE: Good value and quality from a known brand.
