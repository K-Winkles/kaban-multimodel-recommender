                "reviewText": "These undies are so comfortable. The quality and the fit are excellent. (The colors are probably unpredictable \u2014 I got burgundy, charcoal and salmon. I don\u2019t care about the colors, I am mainly concerned about the comfort, quality and fit, which are excellent. My pant size is 12 or 14, and I got these undies in size 9 \u2014 size 9 is a perfect fit. I love the fabric blend \u2014 very breathable and comfortable. I got the cotton blend bikinis (cotton and spandex). I should mention that the \u201cbikini\u201d is a full cut. At first I ordered the hipsters because I didn\u2019t want low-cut undies. But the hipsters came up to my waist, too much like granny panties. So I ordered the bikinis, and they do provide full coverage.The stretch of the fabric is very nice, and the elastic around the waistband and legs is very comfortable. These cotton blend undies are breathable and comfortable. They fit smoothly and don\u2019t show panty lines through your clothes.I immediately ordered another set, and I will order more. They were on sale for $9.99 for a pack of six. That\u2019s a really good value. It can be hard to find underwear that meet all the requirements, and these check all the boxes for me. I will order more, so that I don\u2019t have to go on another underwear expedition anytime soon. Thanks, Fruit of the Loom, for these quality, comfy undies.",

                "reviewText": "These are the most comfortable and fun plus size shorts to wear around the house on any occasion, now that's how comfortable they are. I enjoy wearing them especially for lounging or sleeping in them. They don't ride up, and they are the prefect length and fit. I guess that's why they are effectless because of the way they have a nice stretch to them and are not too tight. They are very breathable, so I don't sweat in them because they keep me feeling cool. Around the elastic band it bends a little, and the white shorts are see through, so I gave them to someone that's why they are not in the picture. I highly recommend these comfortable shorts because they have the best stretch and fun colors to wear!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought these hoping they would work out and the price was very good compared to other styles of the same brand. I was pleasantly surprised! I think these are the most comfortable underwear I have tried so far. I usually prefer 100% cotton and these are a 60/40 but it actually makes them more comfortable. They don't shrink at all so the fit is more true to size. They feel somewhat smooth and silky and there are less pantyline issues. They have some stretch which adds to the comfort level and the elastic around the legs does not dig in or cause irritation. Great buy for the money. I do wish there were more lighter colors.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s comfy, durable, & soft to boot if you want to have these as you go-out underwear.The only three cons are the elastic isn\u2019t very stretchable especially around the leg region ( You probably have to carefully stretch it out around the leg holes or wait after a few washes so it will not pinch so much). The waist band is too short so if you want a longer width of a band, look elsewhere. And, the material of the underwear feels very thin and not thick as I wanted. Probably not good for the cold weather but perfect for the hot and sunny weather.Besides the cons, I recommend these as part of your essential underwear attire.",

Although I'm sure there must be cotton blended in, it is difficult to recognize that fact. If you prefer nylon underwear, then you should be ok with these, but any true cotton lover will not.I would recommend checking out the differences in the styles and fabrics in a store where you can see and touch the fabric for yourself. Online purchases of clothing items are tough and this package of underwear is expensive. I would rather pay more at a regular store and get what I know I would like.",

They don't roll down, very comfortable, I don't feel them on. I ordered the dark mixed bikini. The colors that came were better than the ones shown on the pic. I got 2 dark wine red, 2 dark dust rose and 2 dark gray. Love them! Ordered another pack. I hope to get the same colors as my first order.True to size in my case.
