But, apparently, what Fruit of the Loom or Amazon thinks is the right size is tight. The other thing I found is that the black and the grey feel different. The black feels kind of clingy. They shouldn't feel very different, because the fabric is the same and the appearance of the weave is the same. But the grey seems a tiny bit thicker and feels softer and more comfortable to me.",

                "reviewText": "The one on the right is the first thermal I received which was perfect in every way, shape and form... Then I order/exchange 1,2,3 more and keep getting the one on the left.the right one = Color is actually black, material is comfortable and light weight, stretchy a bit and fits perfect. It is just like alll the thermals I owned throughout life and I use to live in the snow and went through a lot of thermals, I even wash many times already and still perfect.the left one = color is super light and grayish but not even black, material is ruff and itchy feeling, thick, not stretchy at all and even Extra large size before I wash it is too tight for my arms. The length is shorter. Just all around not as nice...first time I order it came perfect, black,65%Poly,35%cotton,made in Honduras. Fits perfect.all others I ordered so far are NOT black, different material,52% cotton, 48% poly, too tight, made in El Salvador. completely different. Doesn't even fit and hard to pull onto my arms yet body is way bigger. I am average size so arms should not be that tight. I know thermals are meant to be tight but not this tight yet body of thermal is way baggier than arms.I would understand getting the one I don't like if it was the first one I received I would have just returned and moves on to other brands. But since the first one came and is so nice I wanted more of the \"same\" they should make it clear that they could come from different places and made with different material and different blend and different size and different color... at least set the expectations correctly from the start. I am just surprised as I didn't expect this from a brand like Fruit of the Loom. All my Amazon brand and Thermal John and Dickies and Hanes brand ones I bought (as I ordered one of each to see what ones I like the best) and for different reasons I like the other brands and ordered more and always get same exact item. Actually always for years when ordering from Lucky brand or any brand name I always get the same item. So not sure why only Fruit of the Loom is sending different kinds of the same thermal first and second letting something this bad of quality be in use as one of the kinds of one of their items. love the first one I received but now wish I never received the good one as now I want more. If I only received the bad one first at least I wold t be going through all this to try to get the one I like.\"first time I order it came perfect, black,65%Poly,35%cotton,made in Honduras. Fits perfect.\"****PLEASE SEND ME THE ONE MADE IN HONDURAS... I will buy a lot of them while I can if I can actually get the nice one sent to me :( otherwise I will have to keep searching for another thermal that is just like the first one from another brand. So far amazon's brand is second in the running and the best overall. It is just a little thicker so harder to wear under t-shirts if desired. But otherwsise amazon brand thermal closest to real original style thermals from throughout my life. Thanks you Honduras for making such a nice thermal and I hope I can get a few more just like the first one I received.I will change the review to all five star if I can get more of the good ones like the first shirt I ordered (also I ordered these within days of each other so not like the style has changed or something, I just think the ones made in El Salvador are a lot cheaper made and horrible material. If you are listening Fruit of the Loom... Please don't sell a product of this low quality. Stick with Honduras as the ones they make are perfect. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
