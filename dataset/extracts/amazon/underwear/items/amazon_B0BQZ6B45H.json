                "reviewText": "I love the thick band of elastic, very sturdy. Leg holes are perfectly lined, and the cotton panty liner tends to be the same color as the panty itself, except the black floral (lining is white). They are a better value than jockey as of current, I'd say the same id not better quality, the band on these is a heavier duty than the other brand. Leg holes are better seamed, I can't see them coming undone or tearing at that seam in the future, unlike Jockey. The only potential issue is the sizing; I followed the brands chart and got a small (my hips are 36 to 36.5 depending on day, upper hip where the hipsters sit is about 33.5 inches). its a tight, solid fit but not uncomfortable, no excess fabric for those lighter in the trunk, but the band causes a muffin top, a little fat overflow. Im 5ft5in and slim, I think its a broad hip issue, i could potentially size up buts not absolutely necessary. I personally love my Jockey classic high leg panties cause its perfect fit but needed panties that weren't 3 inches out of my jeans. I now want the high leg version of these.Take away:Comparable to jockey: more for money, better band and higher quality stitching on leg holesYou might forget you're wearing them!Just BUY THEM! If you need a variety of cuts, for home or on the go, you have what you need right here.",

When I removed them from the packaging they appeared to be very large but they fit perfectly so I guess, just not as stretchy as expected. I like the material which is cool and soft and the waistband is very comfortable. The colors are nice too. I bought few packs, because I was not sure how long they would last but after several washes they are still holding up well! Will certainly recommend and buy again.",

I just wanted to say that these are very comfortable and breathable. I really like how thick the band if for around my waist, it feels very secure and has not had issues rolling down like some of my other thin banded pairs of other brands. The quality of these feels really good and these are a great value! I will for sure be buying more, now I can just keep my fingers crossed some day there is a new set with new colors!",
