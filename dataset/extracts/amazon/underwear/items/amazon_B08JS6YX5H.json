They seem to be well sewn and high quality both In materials and workmanship. The colors are calming and I love the ditzy print on the two pair of print undies. If you can, order a size or two larger than you usually take. I usually get a size smaller than I ordered, but I wanted underpants that were a little roomier because I am not as active as I used to be. These feel small compared to the one-size-smaller size I usually wear. They are also 100% cotton, so expect them to shrink a little. I will wash these in cold water and line dry them. Maybe they will stretch a bit with wear. Overall, though I\u2019m pretty happy with these and think they are worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "I have been buying the same size and style of Hanes underwear for years. They have always fit and have been comfortable. Unfortunately they are rarely in stock in my preferred style and size at my local big box store, so I decided to order on Amazon. I was so thrilled to find them in organic cotton. Who really wants all the cotton pesticides and questionable dyes on their private bits anyway. So, I happily ordered the same style and size that I always have. The 5 pack shipped on time, delivered on time, and after opening, I put all into the laundry. Now, I am pretty particular about my clothes and I was everything on delicate and hang dry, because I want to extend the life of ALL my clothing. Anyway, I put a pair on this morning and OMG. I don't understand if Hanes decided to cut these smaller to save on cost because, it's organic cotton and they are trying to keep cost down by making these smaller or if Hanes changed their sizing, but these are NOT the same as the conventional cotton size and style that I own. This is seriously pathetic to see another big company trying to make a profit on something that all people are entitled to- clean. good for you, non toxic goods. I will not be purchasing from Hanes again. It's so annoying for businesses to do this to the people. Done with it. I highly recommend you giving other brands the business and not these companies who try to pull the wool over our eyes by using trends to lure you in. BTW, these underwear are overall smaller- the rise is shorter, the fabric width is cut smaller, there is overall much less fabric than their conventional counterparts and these \"organic \" version runs at least a size smaller than their regular version.",
