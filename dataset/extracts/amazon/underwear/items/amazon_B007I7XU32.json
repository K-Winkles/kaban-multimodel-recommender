                "reviewText": "The panties I am reviewing are made of 100% Nylon. I ordered them because I thought I would like the \"no side seam\" feature. However, I am not pleased at all. This fabric stretches quite a bit, almost like they are a size or two larger, with the waistband sitting above my navel, almost up to my waist. I had recently ordered a different style of Jockey underwear made out of a blend of MicroModal and Spandex, briefs, and they fit as expected, with the waistband sitting just below my navel. Wish I could return the nylon set, but I wouldn't feel right about it since I've worn and washed them. Side note: the fabric is very soft and comfortable - they are just this side of being too big to wear.",
