Also so stretchy!! They are full coverage yet also still cute and are not riding out of the top of your pants. I have had a few pair for so many years and they last. Also wash well.",

                "reviewText": "Didn't expect to like these panties because they look and feel like they don't have any structure and would slide down while you were wearing them. Turns out they fit great and really don't leave a panty line, and they don't fall down. The animal print is excellent. I wash them in a lingerie bag with other nicer clothes and hang dry. I'm 5'5\" and weigh 150'. Size 7 fits well--I tried the 8 and they were way too big. You don't want your undies to be so big that you can grab the waistband and pull them up to make a onesie! Anyway, these are comfortable and cute. Highly recommended.",
