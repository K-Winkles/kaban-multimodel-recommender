The also fit like glove (in a class by themselves). I finally noticed some signs of wear showing up so I decided to order the closest CK current product in the same size.The fit is not good. I needed the next larger size with the current product. I can\u2019t blame that on CK. Even if I had ordered size Large they would have still not fit well. Unlike my old CKs that came with, and still have, a well formed pouch they have an almost flat area there. This is fine for women\u2019s underwear but not for a guy. The fabric and construction both seem really superior.I guess I\u2019ll hang on to my old CKs till they fall apart. Oh well.",
