                "reviewText": "Hanes made a great decision with the 95% cotton / 5% spandex blend on all prints and solid colors (except gray). The material is super soft and extremely comfortable to wear all day long. They leave plenty of room in all of the right places. Note: The grays are 58% cotton / 37% polyester / 5% spandex, but those feel slightly different, but still nice.I like the fact that the waistband is more of a normal size and not like some of the oversized ones with the jumbo HANES text that they've been putting out in recent years. The waistband on these boxer briefs is just a nice, normal size and is quite comfortable.I've been so pleased with these boxer briefs that I went ahead and ordered all three versions of the 6-packs that are available as of mid-2023 (the gray/blue/black, the Blue Camo/Khaki/Black, and the Olive/Maroon/Gray). The price point of the 6-packs is a great value, and I've been very pleased with the quality and consistency of all versions of the product.To address some of the concerns I've read from other folks:1) I've seen people mention that some of the pairs with prints (as opposed to solid colors) feel rough. That's pretty normal when fresh out of the box, but one wash should soften them up most of the way, and 2-3 washes should soften them up all of the way, so that they'll feel just as smooth as the solids.2) It's perfectly normal for the gray/blue/black 6-pack to come without a box, contained in a plastic sleeve instead. This particular color combo is an Amazon-exclusive (as of August 2023), and seemingly for that reason, the decision was made to sell this color combo in minimalist packaging, as opposed to the boxes that are used for the other color combos. Rest assured that the product is still new and inside original factory packaging. It's just a plastic sleeve instead of a box. (picture attached)If I could change one thing about the gray/blue/black 6-pack, I would have included less gray and black and a little more of the blues, but hey, that's just my personal preference. Both the navy blue and the lighter blue are so nice that I *may* have ordered two of these 6-packs just to get more of the blue pairs. Might as well stock up for future use while the product is readily available.",
