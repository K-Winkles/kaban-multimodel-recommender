The pH of ordinary soap, can be very basic (high pH) and may not complement the natural pH range of your external vaginal area. Isn\u2019t Summer\u2019s Eve and Fem Care just if you have a problem? I don\u2019t have an issue \u201cdown there\u201d \u2026 The external vaginal area is different than other parts of your body \u2013 its delicate, and has a different pH than other areas of the body \u2013 and so it needs a different kind of care. What can I do if I experience vaginal itching? If you are experiencing vaginal itching, we recommend you talk with your doctor or healthcare professional about your symptoms. If you know that you have a yeast infection, you can find relief with one of our Monistat products.",

                "reviewText": "I've tried Summer's Eve Simply Sensitive Feminine Body Wash, and it's become a part of my daily routine for maintaining feminine hygiene. This product is both gentle and effective in removing odor and keeping me feeling fresh.One of the things I like about it is that it's pH balanced, which is essential for maintaining the natural balance of the intimate area. The gentle formula makes it suitable for everyday use without causing any irritation. The fact that it comes in a travel-size 3-pack is convenient for those on the go.The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is that it doesn't stand out as exceptional compared to some other similar products on the market. However, it does what it's supposed to do and provides that extra level of freshness and confidence I look for.In summary, Summer's Eve Simply Sensitive Feminine Body Wash is a reliable choice for daily feminine hygiene, and the travel-sized packs are a practical bonus.",
