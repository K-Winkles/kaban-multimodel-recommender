I only wish they had done without the fragrance. I don't need fragrance down there. Just want pure, simple ingredients and a very basic cleanliness.I appreciate that it's cruelty-free.I feel like the price of roughly $10 isn't too bad for this.It seems to work pretty well.

I know that's probably not even a big worry for most people, but this is being used on my lady bits and having something that could have already been expired is a flag on my radar. I have very sensitive skin down there, like extremely sensitive. But I wanted to give it a fair chance so I tried it out every single day for over a week now.There is no scent in this. Which is awesome for me, Ms Sensitivity and all. The pump is easy to use, but only disperses little at a time. I haven't noticed a difference of anything down there, so this isn't working out for me.",
