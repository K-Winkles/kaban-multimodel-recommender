Because if the creamy not dry texture it literally shrink every time you use till it disappears at day 16 of usage.It also makes such enormous residue in the bath that you have to clean the bath tub with degreasing solution after the shower every single time other wise you can easily slip next time you take the shower.Small is really ok. Don\u2019t love it, is on the cheaper soap smell side but is really ok. Not bad. Not strong.

At least they seem to allow returns but honestly this kind of nonsense makes it expected. I guess makes me feel better I can return it since I can't give less than one star. People need to pay attention to what they put in and on their bodies. My goodness, have self respect.",

I did however start getting some type of irritation after using it only on my labia. To be fair, I have issues with coconut oil on my skin and most products that contain coconut oil don't bother me, but this is the first time using anything with coconut oil on my intimate areas. So if you are someone who has trouble with coconut oil, I'd go for something else. I can't fault the bar for something I have issues with.As for cleansing my body, as I mentioned, it did a good job without drying my skin out at all. I find it smells pretty good. I am not sure if it is supposed to have pieces of grit in it, but at times I feel like there is something in it.Honestly, I'm just going to stick to either gel based intimate washes or Dove bars. I have had no issues with it.",
