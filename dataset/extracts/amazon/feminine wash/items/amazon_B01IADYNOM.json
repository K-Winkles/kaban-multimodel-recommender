                "reviewText": "I did not get paid to rate this item, I saw a YouTube video of a couple talking about the picture on the bottle, and she went on and on about how much she likes this product so I thought I would try it, this is a seriously good product I have been searching for years for product that would agree with my skin, ever since I went through menopause I've had trouble and this is the first product that agreed with me. I bought a four pack because it seems like once I find something I like it is discontinued this is a great product.",

It\u2019s also good to use while soaking in the tub! I\u2019m also super sensitive down there & this is the first feminine wash that doesn\u2019t irritate me down there! I have all my friends hooked on Lemisol, I wish they made feminine wipes!",
