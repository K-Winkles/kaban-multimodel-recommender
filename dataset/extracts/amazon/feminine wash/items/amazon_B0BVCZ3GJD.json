It worked for its purpose throughout an entire 3-4 hours of sweating and walking through the ren Faire in a skirt. It does get on dark clothing so be careful.Pros: works fantastic, even survived sweaty walking for hours, cheap, easy to apply, doesn't feel sticky and don't really feel it after rubbing it in, doesn't have too much of a strong scentCons: the only REAL con I had was that just touching black clothing after applying when I thought it was mostly off my hands caused it to get white all over the black clothing (very much like powder Deodorant does) [the good news is the white stains came out in the wash and didn't stain permanently or bleach anything], if you don't want ANY scent this isn't for you, the scent isn't strong, but there is one.This product makes it possible for my to comfortably wear skirts again!",

It really slowed me down so I did research and bought some slip shorts to where under my pants. They worked just fine but they were uncomfortable and hot because of the weather here. When I got this I lathered on a decent layer on my inner thighs and every since then I haven't chafed. You will definitely have to reapply after a good amount of hours. I start work at 8:30 am and end at about 4 pm after then I definitely have to reapply if I'm working that evening. So perfect and I love it!",
