Based on my personal experience, it seems like low PH body wash is the answer for the dryness and itchiness caused by health conditions or injury.For it\u2019s intended purpose, this is the best intimate wash I\u2019ve tried. It corrected my imbalance on the first use and I really enjoy the smell. When you\u2019re in the shower it smells a tad bit like glue, but once your out the smell starts to change and an hour later it smells really good.I started using this as a body wash two months ago after acute kidney injury made crazy itchy and dry. My skin was immediately relieved as I was lathering.\u2026Then I got a second degree sunburn on my entire front side. We\u2019re talking purple-black sunburn with open wounds. This relieved much of the pain and my sunburn healed surprisingly fast. I\u2019m going to seek out a low PH lotion to use with this, but this is now my go to body and intimate wash.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried many feminine products/ or products in general that are supposed to be for your delicate area below. However, by far- this is the best one. I have only had it for a short time and already know that I will be re-ordering. This is truly made for cleaning that area (my experience only). I have tried soaps: Dove/Caress/Unscented blah blah's- no matter what they say, I'm convinced that soap you clean your body with does not work well in that area. Only makes it itchy or irritated with the harsh chemicals, causing a uncomfortable day ahead. I have tried Cetaphil skin cleanser, though this did not irritate me; it didn't make me feel clean. I've tried Dherbs soap- \"Yoni Soap\", this does make you feel clean, however, my first experience with that was horrific. You really have to prepare yourself with that soap, as I almost threw it away as it was very harsh on me at first; but like all products I buy- I try to give them a little while before passing full judgement. I've tried the Johnson & Johnson baby washes- they are are nice, however, being a woman, I want to smell like a woman not a baby- and your expectations for using baby washes mirror who it is intended for. Anyways, my point is- try this. I did not have any bad reaction, itch, rash, burn, or anything. It makes you feel extremely clean and fresh with a light scent. You don't smell like a vagina and you don't smell like a flower down below- just clean. Whatever you smelt like before your shower/bath you will certainly enjoy how refreshed you feel after using this. This really cuts any smell away, lathers well, and just makes you feel clean. You even feel refreshed throughout the day after using this. Luckily, I was able to use during my cycle- and I must say, this is very very nice. Glad I tried this!",

                "reviewText": "This hasn't cured my BV or anything... But it has helped for sure. I am SO sensitive... there isn't any type of wash I was even willing to try if it had soap or a specific scent to it. Even if something helps my feminine area, if it isn't BABY gentle it will give me a UTI. So I gave up the idea of using any cleansers 'down there'. Been using this pretty regularly for a few weeks. I am in a newer relationship so I really try and use this any time after intercourse (which is a lot, so my BV has been acting up). It definitely helps and sooths if I feel any irritation or itch. And it helps keep me smelling clean down there. No UTI yet! So I am one happy customer. Still working on finding a complete routine that fixes my PH issues all together... But this will definitely be a part of that routine, as long as no issues arise in the future (I will update if that happens). Baby steps to getting healthy :) Finger's crossed! Give this a try if you feel you are impossibly sensitive and have given up hope with cleansers, like me. Good luck ladies <3!",
