Well, let me tell you, my shower is now officially the hottest comedy club in town, thanks to JASON.First off, the scent is like a delightful herb party in your shower. Forget singing in the rain; I'm doing stand-up with the Moisturizing Herbs ensemble. It's so refreshing; I half expect my loofah to join in with a knock-knock joke.Now, let's talk about the moisturizing magic \u2013 my skin feels softer than a kitten in a cashmere sweater. If I had a mic, I'd drop it in sheer shower satisfaction.The 30 oz bottle is like the comedian who never leaves the stage \u2013 it just keeps delivering laughs (and suds). It's like having a stand-up special every day, and my skin is the star of the show.Plus, the label promises \"no parabens or harsh sulfates.\" I appreciate that. Who needs harsh sulfates when your shower is already full of drama? This body wash keeps it real \u2013 just like a good punchline.In conclusion, if you want your shower routine to be more fun than a barrel of monkeys (with herbs), JASON Natural Moisturizing Herbs Body Wash is your ticket to a clean comedy act. Five stars for the laughter, applause, and the freshest feeling ever!",

The price is is great - the same that it used to be at our market about 5 years ago.The scent smells like true Lavender, but not overwhelming and it is nicely moisturizing. Highly recommend",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Smells like chemicals, not Lavender. Sensitive people beware!",
                "reviewText": "I wanted to like this body wash. I really did. The price was right, and I thought the product would be natural enough for me. Apparently not.Immediately upon opening the box, I could smell the perfume. The bottles weren't leaking at all, either. So, very strong scent. Now, let's be clear: I AM mildly sensitive to chemicals and perfumes, but I can't recall ever sneezing uncontrollably to anything NATURAL. I use essential oils all the time (which have strong scents, though natural), as well as heavily scented natural products. Never a problem there. This made me sneeze like crazy when I used it. That's not a desirable effect in a shower, with hard surfaces to knock one's head on when you're flailing like, well, a person who is sneezing like crazy. It's especially not good for someone who recently had hip surgery (no, people, I'm actually only 27) because sneezing can make you nearly fall over in a slippery shower, especially when you're already unsteady. When I first got this (before surgery) it was still making me sneeze a week later. I thought *Hmm, that might fade. I might get acclimated to it. I'd better give it a good go, since I bought so much of it!* I bought this in November. It is now April. I have NOT acclimated to it. Still sneezing, and it's from this product. I know because I've made brief switches to other products (Burt's Bees, African Black bar soaps, castile soap) and haven't sneezed. Then I use this again. I shower, sneeze my brains out, hope I don't crack my head or fall, almost do, and kick myself for buying this. I'm not exaggerating; the sneezing fits are really quite extraordinary. I leave the door unlocked so my husband can rescue me in the event of a sneezing catastrophe. But, well... at least you know it lasts a long time!? I wish it didn't. Why am I still using it? \"Waste not, want not\", with a caveat: \"Hope you don't die in the shower.\"There is definitely a chemical smell to this. Lavender? HA! One of my favorite essential oils to use is Lavender. This is NOT LAVENDER! It smells (to me) like a chemical re-creation of lavender. A very poor one.It does have its merits, however. What I can say for the wash is this: A couple of pumps does the job rather well, though I'm petite, so you may need a few more. It lathers well for a not-so-conventional, wants-to-be-\"natural\" body wash. It makes you feel clean without drying, yet doesn't make you feel over-moisturized or coated in something like super-moisturizing washes do. It also hasn't caused any skin irritation, which is a miracle for me, considering my reaction to the scent, and sensitive skin. The product is a good value, if your body doesn't give you violent reactions to it. So, three stars. I'm trying to be fair.Given the cleansing performance of this product, some (curious or self-destructive) part of me is tempted to try the tea tree. I love tea tree almost as much as lavender. But since this smells like chemical NOT-lavender, I'm afraid of what the tea tree would smell like/do. Perhaps it will make my eyeballs bleed and fall out? Okay, I'm kidding about my eyeballs. But I wouldn't buy this product again. If there is an unscented version, I might try a sample to see if it makes me react. Otherwise, when I'm done with this, I shall steer clear of the body wash of doom.",
