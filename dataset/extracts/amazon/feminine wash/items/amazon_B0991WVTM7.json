                "reviewText": "Taking off one star because everytime I order this the package always comes smashed or broken which is irritating because it's not that hard to properly package something so that doesn't happen.... Besides that the product itself comes intact with no issues and works very well for me I always make sure I never run out! I'm super happy I found this company! I used to suffer from yeast infections a lot but ever since I combined the instant odor rinse, their suppositories and their vaginal foaming shower wash I have not had a single yeast infection! This product is nice because it does give you a nice clean feeling once you are done and peace of mind knowing you are douching with good clean safe ingredients that will not give you any issues or throw anything off.",
