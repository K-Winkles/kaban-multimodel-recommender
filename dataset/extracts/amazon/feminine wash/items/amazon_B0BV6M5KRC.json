Not to mention how good I smelled!Smell: amazing doesn't even cut it. It's strong scent is not overpowering but lingers for a long time. The oil was even betterQuality: I wasn't expecting it to suds up as much as it did so pleasant surprise there. The bars are a good size and should last me quite some time. The oil goes on dry and doesn't leave a residue and I only needed 3 drops to cover the area. It will last me a while.Appearance: the entire package was nice. The box was pleasing to look at and the instructions were easy to read. The soaps have a beautiful peach color and the oil is inside a glass jar with a high quality and durable dropper.Overall: I highly recommend this and will absolutely be buying more. Make sure to buy a net bag if you want to use it with one because it didn't come with one.",

I used it on the rest of my body and it prevented me from sweating as much as I tend to do which made me so happy. I am ordering more! You had better get yourself some too ASAP!",
