            "GENTLE CARE FOR DOWN THERE: Our wash is designed to gently cleanse, moisturize, and soothe the sensitive vulvovaginal area, while removing odor-causing bacteria and maintaining proper pH levels. Our feminine wash naturally restores pH balance, unlike bar soaps and other feminine washes, which have a basic pH and can be harmful to such a sensitive and delicate area of the body.",
            "MADE FOR ALL VULVAS: Developed by an OB/GYN, a naturopath, our woman founder, and a chemist, our Gentle Feminine Wash was made for even the most sensitive vulvas. This feminine wash is safe to use every time you wash, and is formulated for ages 0 and up.",
            "NATURAL & ORGANIC INGREDIENTS: Made in the USA with all natural botanicals and some certified organic ingredients. Formulated with Certified Organic Aloe Vera, Certified Organic Cucumber, and Certified Organic Green Tea extracts to cleanse, soothe and moisturize, without any added harmful pesticides/chemicals.",
            "FRAGRANCE FREE & GLYCERIN FREE: Formulated without fragrances to prevent dryness, pH imbalances, and infections. Formulated without glycerin (a sugar that can \u201cfeed\u201d yeast and ultimately, may cause infections) to keep a healthy vaginal environment.",
            "HOW TO USE: Apply about a quarter-size amount to the palm of very wet (and clean!) hands. Work into a lather (to the chorus of your favorite song!). During that time, our feminine wash will create a rich, silky lather. Gently apply externally from front to bum. Rinse clean. Gentle enough for daily use."

It's a good, clean scent but very reminiscent for me. I can't help but wonder if the product was based off of the SE product. It isn't cheap for sure, but I find it worth it. I try to use it sparingly. I might update with how long it lasts.I have only used it a few times, but so far I am pleased. I feel that it cleans well but does not do so in a way that's aggressive. A true gentle clean. TMI?: I can't speak to the PH stuff, but I will say that it leaves me with a clean, natural scent after a long day. With intimate cleansers that appear to aggressively clean, I find that by day's end there is some \"off\" smell. Very happy overall.",

                "reviewText": "This has been my go-to product for my \"hoohoo\" area for at least six months now.Pros:Very gentle, no strong scent or strong ingredients (that I have noticed). Ph balancing and fragrance free. Leaves me feeling clean down there without being too harsh. I switched to this product because the last feminine wash I had tried gave me a UTI and the one before that straight up BURNED. Overall I have been pretty happy with this wash. Though it has anti bacterial ingredients (anti bacteria products in your hoohoo is generally a no-no) I haven't noticed any symptoms of a bacteria imbalance so I feel like the ingredients themselves are having less of an anti-bacteria effect on me and more of a bacteria balancing, which I appreciate.Cons:I have noticed that if I let it \"sit\" for more than the amount of time it takes for me to get the detachable showerhead down to rinse (basically about 20-30 seconds) that for the rest of the day it will hurt to urinate. This just means some product snuck it's way into my urinary tract which is annoying. If I rinse it off as fast as I possibly can after lathering I don't encounter this problem at all. Another con is that during my period I have to wash myself with this twice (I do the full lather - thoroughly rinse - repeat process) each shower in order to not smell like a viking hunting lodge down there and even then the fresh smell isn't as long lasting as others have been during my period.",

                "reviewText": "First off, beware of high prices! If it has an unusually high price and crazy high shipping don't buy it! This means that healthy hoohoo needs to restock their inventory, so 3rd party resellers are marking up the price and hiking up the shipping while us consumers wait for inventory to be replaced.The real company will always be retail price found on healthy hoohoo site (around $13) and have prime shipping available! (I found this all out by emailing the company when I saw no prime shipping and the cost being around $25 including shipping) I will be buying it again when it restocks so I'm not overpaying! This stuff is great! It comes in a small bottle but you only need a tiny amount so it lasts a long time! I love that it is fragrance free. I've used other washes that are unscented but have a really strange smell. This wash is truly unscented and cleans well. I'm sensitive and it never irritates my skin.",
