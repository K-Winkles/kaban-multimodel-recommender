                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this feminine wash. It's only very lightly (and naturally) scented. Ingredients are organic, vegan and minimal - and that's great, because I know there's not a bunch of chemical crud in the wash. It's great for my very sensitive skin. Even with daily use, it still took over 6 mo to use it. It's not expensive, but the quality is PHENOMENAL. Gently washes away any odors, without a bunch of chemicals and artificial perfumes or colors. I work out, and that area can smell pretty sweaty but this gently washes body odors away, without throwing off the pH down there. I use it to wash my armpits & my booty, too.Please remember that you only use this on the OUTSIDE, y'all. I think it should go without saying, but I've seen a few reviews that spoke about using it to wash inside the vagina. No no no.. Think of that area inside like a self cleaning oven - you only need to clean the outside.",
