                "reviewText": "This is a wonderful cleanser and I was very happy with it until I realized it has phenoxyethanol. I urge you to read ingredients of any self care product carefully. Through my research I have found that \"paraben free\" or \"natural\" and even \"organic\" products can sometimes use questionable ingredients. For that reason I gave it a four star instead of five.",
