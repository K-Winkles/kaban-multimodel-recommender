                "reviewText": "I bought these for on-the-go use as I refuse to use the 1-ply that most public restrooms have. I love that they're individually packaged which makes it easy to pop a few in your purse. I go back and forth between these scented ones and another brand that is unscented, and I've found that I prefer these ones. The vanilla is not that fake sweet-smelling scent that you usually get, it's pleasant but lingers, which is nice because let's face it who doesn't want to smell fresh down there? The only downside for me is that they're not flushable but that's not a dealbreaker.",
