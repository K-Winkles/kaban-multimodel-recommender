A little goes a long way, the size is easily portable, it's easy to use and I feel like my cups get squeaky clean - plus, I don't have to worry about any weird chemicals that might degrade the cup or cause internal issues. Plus, it's nice having a safe, organic/natural ingredient wash that is used just for my cups. And the price is super reasonable! I'm just now running low on the tube I've had for a year! Go ahead and add this to your cart right now - don't overthink it!",
