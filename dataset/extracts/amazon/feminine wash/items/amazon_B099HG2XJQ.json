                "reviewText": "When I saw the Lume commercial about old people smell, it freaked me out .. Definitely more than mothballs and Denture Cream. She explained that old people don't have the ability to break down certain whatever is on our decrepit old bodies (she said it nicer than that) and a little help is needed to dissolve that old people smell.Oh DearI've been using natural deodorant (Native.. available at most supermarkets and Walmart. and Lume which I order) for over a year now.. which I love since you don't get pit stains on white shirts.. which probably comes from aluminum based deodorants. Lume does the same. I use the Lume cream deodorant..Non yellow pit stains on tee shirts is a win win.Lume is one of many on the market today..and all brands are a bit pricey..and you have to find the right one for you.The thing with Lume is that it kind of has an off scent that's not completely the flavor variety it specifies. So don't expect to be perfumed by it.. it neutralizes crevice odor.Ew. but Yay!Whenever you peruse Amazon.. look for sales.You don't have to use a lot to clean your body and it does work very well.I'm a return customer.",

                "reviewText": "I'm always switching up my body washes in what feels like a never ending quest to find the perfect one. I think I may have found it with Lume. I don't know what kind of wizardry was put into this formula.....?!!About my skin: I have dry skin, so I need a body wash that moisturizes. I typically stay away from what looks like a clear gel body wash (as this one is) due to that reason. In my mind, I tend to think they aren't as moisturizing. I did finally decide to give this a go and a fair chance, while browsing yet again here on Amazon, for a oil based body wash. Note: this is not an oil based body wash but it came up in my search.My experiment was to use this product only and not follow up with a body lotion or body oil after I towel off, as I wanted to see how my skin would feel and react to it throughout the day.Not only did my skin feel a whole other level of clean. LIke, I have always thought previous body washes did a good job with that of course but wow, there is another level of clean guys and it feels divine! Like I said, I skipped any kind of body lotions and a body oil I tend to use after a shower also. So not only did this take clean to a new level but my skin was soft, comfortable, and did not dry out throughout the day and into the next day when I hopped back in the shower again to do it all over.Now I will not always skip the body lotion, the body butters, and the body oils. It was just my one, 24 hour experiment to see how my skin would react. I purchased the one bottle option of the Peony Rose NOT on subscribe and save. Just the one time purchase option to see if it would work for my dry skin. I've used Lume's deodorant in this scent and I have always liked it. UNLIKE the deoderant, which does have that odd smell that accompanies it and turns people off (you know it does dissipate though, right? Just go with it cause the deodorant is great) The body wash DOES NOT have that odd smell. I'm sensitive to smells so if I can't smell that odd smell, it's just not there. When I opened my Amazon package of this, it was the one thing I wanted to see first. All I get is this soft and gorgeous scent of Peony Rose. I will say that the scent is very faint after you towel off and then the scent is not noticeable after a while, which is fine for me. This way it will not interfere with my perfume.I would give this 10 stars if I could. I highly recommend this incredible body wash!! If you do by chance feel you need more moisture for dry skin, you can always just put on the body lotion and potions afterwards. I came back today to get this on subscribe and save!",

                "reviewText": "First off, the product wasn't packaged well and it was obviously smashed or tossed and arrived with the flip cap broken and some of product leaking out. A mess. At least it was soap so it washed off.Secondly, it's near impossible to squeeze out the appropriate amount. Instead of the small bit, a huge blob comes out and at that price, wasting more than I actually use is a huge issue. I'll look to see if I can find a travel or sample lotion bottle I can put the rest in so I only squeeze out the amount I need.The product worked pretty good. The smell was pleasant enough for me but I wouldn't want to use a perfume in addition to mix aromas.I've tried it on pits and lower bits but haven't had the opportunity to see if it works for 72 hours.I did go a while without deodorant and I did notice I still smelled only a light whiff of the product and no B.O. a few hours later. A definite plus.Since I shower daily I haven't had the chance to see if it keeps odors away for 72 hours.If I can figure out how to only squeeze out the amount I need, I would use it on a regular basis. Until then, I'll wait and only use it when I'll be working out or know I'll be skipping a few showers",
