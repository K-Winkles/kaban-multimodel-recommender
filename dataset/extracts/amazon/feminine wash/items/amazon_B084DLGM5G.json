Our Refresh Collection is for those who love to bask in luscious fragrances. It has has an extensive range of fragrance levels, from a light, barely-there fragrance or a bold fragrance that gives you a long-lasting boost of freshness Why does pH matter? It's important to your body\u2019s natural defense and maintaining a good environment for a healthy external vaginal area. The pH of ordinary soap, can be very basic (high pH) and may not complement the natural pH range of your external vaginal area. Isn\u2019t Summer\u2019s Eve and Fem Care just if you have a problem? I don\u2019t have an issue \u201cdown there\u201d \u2026 The external vaginal area is different than other parts of your body \u2013 its delicate, and has a different pH than other areas of the body \u2013 and so it needs a different kind of care. What can I do if I experience vaginal itching? If you are experiencing vaginal itching, we recommend you talk with your doctor or healthcare professional about your symptoms. If you know that you have a yeast infection, you can find relief with one of our Monistat products.",

                "reviewText": "This is the best fragrance that Summers Eve has. Its fruity and smells like Mango and Peaches. Who can say no? I use all of the products. I shower with this and it cleans me and removes all bad smell from privates for at least 2 days. I also use the golden glamour wipes for refreshing after using the restroom I use for vagina and my behind too before I finish, and also the spray for my vulva area hold it at least 8 inches away and spray vulva and panties. You will never feel self conscious or not confident again. You will feel like you can do anything. Hygiene for women is very important to their self image.",
