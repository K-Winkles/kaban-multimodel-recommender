Lavender to me either smells really good or like dog shampoo. There\u2019s no in between\u2026 and no one wants their cooch smelling like dog shampoo. Also there\u2019s a pump but no thing inside to pump it through. I thought this was an error in order but both bottles were like that\u2026 so I guess you\u2019re just supposed to pump a million times holding it upside down for little drops to come out. It does what it\u2019s supposed to I guess. But I\u2019m going back to my other brand which I prefer much better!",
