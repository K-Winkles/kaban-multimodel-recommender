So, if you have similar issues or just want a quality wash; this is it. This soap has helped so much. Quality, gentle ingredients that really help keep things balanced and clean.

I did use it because I needed a POST BIRTH gentle cleanser for my lady parts.After a few weeks of use, the foaming pump became very tough to push down - which wasn't originally the case. Not only did the pump become increasingly difficult to \"pump\", the scent of the product completely changed - I have now determined that the oil inside it has gone rancid.Really unfortunate experience. i do love HoneyPot pads... but you can get other brands like Natracare that are organic and not scented with oils that could go rancid - not worth the risk. I recommend adding your own oils, and I did that to make my own padscicles for post labor healing - IT WAS MAGNIFICENT.",
