My daughter calls it \"the girly wash\"\ud83d\ude02My children, 13 & 10, both use it as well. What I really enjoy about this product is the scent is quite light but fresh. It is not very thick, more of a thinner liquid so you have to be careful when squeezing to apply. It produces nice bubbling, it feels great when you apply it and it washes off cleanly without leaving residue. I actually use it as a full body wash, because I have sensitive skin with eczema as well. It saves me from having flares and keeps my skin comfortable. I definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I got this scent because it was cheaper for some reason, and was worried i wouldn't really enjoy it because I dislike the ocean generally. But, when I use this the scent makes me think more of being on the open sea or a lake, and not the musty beach I thought it might be. Aside from the scent, there is great lather so that you can use a little less each time to make the bottle last that much longer. I would definitely recommend this.",
