Whether you\u2019re constantly on the go, an athlete, or are just looking for an intimate care product that can keep pace with your busy life. Why does pH matter? It's important to your body\u2019s natural defense and maintaining a good environment for a healthy external vaginal area. The pH of ordinary soap, can be very basic (high pH) and may not complement the natural pH range of your external vaginal area. Isn\u2019t Summer\u2019s Eve and Fem Care just if you have a problem? I don\u2019t have an issue \u201cdown there\u201d \u2026 The external vaginal area is different than other parts of your body \u2013 its delicate, and has a different pH than other areas of the body \u2013 and so it needs a different kind of care. What can I do if I experience vaginal itching? If you are experiencing vaginal itching, we recommend you talk with your doctor or healthcare professional about your symptoms. If you know that you have a yeast infection, you can find relief with one of our Monistat products.",

The cool part though....it was literally shocking! I wasn't expecting a very apparent cooling feeling across my WHOLE body when I washed with this. I assumed a cool burst of freshness was more like a scent or something stupid. But no, this cool burst is actually a cooling feeling/sensation that is very strong. Now, it's not like Icey hot or anything, but you will definitely feel it. Even my husband liked the feeling lol.",

I have sensitive skin so I used to only use the sensitive version of summers eve, but I gave this a try and works great on my sensitive skin.. you do get a burst of coldness \u201cdown there\u201d but it subsides. Works all day I even use it in my underarms after I\u2019ve used soap. Def recommend if you are someone who sweats alot or just wants to feel the freshness all day!Also I\u2019ve used it after I\u2019ve shaved down there and it\u2019s helped to not get any razor burn",

                "reviewText": "I usually hate peppermint flavoring or scent, but this is peppermint scent and will leave you feeling fresh, no matter if you worked out or just sweaty from the heat or have thicker thighs and sweaty no matter what you do and cant stop being sweaty in that area. Fells cooling and refreshed, but if you have irritation from shaving or from yeast then you will have a slight burning sensation but afterwards it will be numbed from the peppermint and will have a relief from the itching. I have irritation from shaving but I'm enjoying the coolness from the peppermint. defiantly getting more in the near future.",
