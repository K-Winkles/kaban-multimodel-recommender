When comparing the all natural ingredients combined with a relative affordable price, you can't go wrong. The more I learn about Manuka honey and oil the more I'm wooed by the potential of this somewhat rare product. I also think using purified tallow is much better for your skin than petroleum jelly.It soothes the itch, heals cuts, and moisturizes. I will say unless you really work into your skin repeatedly it will take 30 - 45 minutes for the balm to soak in. It's not a quick absorbing material like your standard lotion from the store. I also use Aveeno oatmeal lotion and that gets absorbed within minutes but doesn't have the long-lasting (that I feel) is a skin rebuilding barrier.Manuka oil is the last item in the ingredient list so probably isn't as plentiful as other products that tout Munuka honey as their primary ingredient. That said, those other items are also 2 or 3x more expensive. I've never been one, despite my skin ailments, to drop $50 or $100 on skin care products. I find this Healing Balm is a happy medium with price and quality. I will be definitely be buying more.",

However, it does have a bit of a grainy texture to it. But it does melt into your skin. So once you get passed that, you should be fine. It also has a strong scent. I\u2019m sure because of the ingredients. I just needed something to help with the skin abscess and it has been keeping it moisturized. As for healing, I\u2019m not sure entirely. Still would recommend for dry skin if you want something more \u201cnatural\u201d.",

                "reviewText": "Only used it twice so far on my under arms and it worked wonders! It has a subtle, pleasant scent after being washed off. I've switched to natural deodorant so the struggle not to smell after a few hours has been real. This has helped to make me smell good all day. No having to reapply my deodorant in the afternoon. I'm going to use it only in the areas that have the most smells- hairy places. As someone else mentioned, it doesnt suds much or for very long. I'm okay with that because I am going to be using it in certain areas and not my whole body. If I was going to use it fully, I wouldn't be happy with the lack of suds. I have other cleansers to meet that need though. I feel confident that I will smell good even through the next morning now. And with there being Manuka oil as well as other oils in it, I am hoping it helps with HS flares. But even if it doesn't, I'll still be using it.",

Also worth noting that it burns like icy hot which can be a surprise if you're not expecting it. Would be bad to get in the eyes. Otherwise seems as described.",

I'm thinking it may be fungal but not sure. He's been to a derm and got very expensive shampoo which didn't do much.This is helping. So far he's only been applying to forehead but he's beginning to go further.It does have a strong tea smell but it disappears fairly soon.It is EXTREMELY moisturizing. When I first got it I applied some to a small area and practically never got it off my hands. So if you want it somewhere it's going to stay there.I have high hopes this will work in several other areas too.",

This Amazing product has the most healing properties, hands down, that I have ever seen or experienced in all of my 56 years !I am blown away completely at the ability this wonderful balm has to heal, protect, restore, and soothe distressed skin. Even the sensitive, fragile, delicate, skin of your face. I've read about the Medicinal properties of the Manuka Honey from New Zealand .. How it is anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-Microbial, also, how it has the ability to be anti-inflammatory as well. And the added ingredients of this healing balm make it such a pleasure to use. It WORKS !! And that is a Mild Understatement.I would advise anyone who is experiencing irritated skin to give this product a try. It could possibly work as well for you as it has for me. Not only will I continue to use this balm, I also intend to purchase a large container of 'CERTIFIED MANUKA HONEY' from New Zealand and add it to my diet too.Terry B",
