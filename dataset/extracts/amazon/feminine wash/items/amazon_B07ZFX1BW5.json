But you\u2019d need a good conditioner afterwards.I\u2019ve used this product for almost 40 years, since I was in my teens, and any time I\u2019ve steer away from it (fir any reason), I regretted it cause my body (parts) need that neutral PH. I was born and lived overseas my first 30 years, and this brand has a full line of products there now, including men and teens. (Growing up this one was it).I am reviewing the item above, as shipping was pretty fast, price is decent, you get two large bottles. I\u2019ve searched far and wide and this was the cheapest one. I used to buy from an online pharmacy that had it a lot cheaper, but they no longer carry it.Pretty satisfied. You should definitely try it, especially if you need a little extra help during your period. Shake before use, you only need a small amount, so it last a long time.",

Or, more accurately, leaves no feeling at all, which \"down there\" is what you want. This time I bought it from Cosme World France, and it was shipped from France beautifully wrapped in secure but not wasteful packaging. Also, Cosme World France supports Flower PowHer, a charity that provides feminine hygiene products to women in need. With so many homeless and refugee women in so many countries, it's nice to know my purchase does a little something to help.",
