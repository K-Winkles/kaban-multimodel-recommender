I have no issues with vaginal dryness I just wanted to try it out and usually I can feel myself getting wet down there throughout the day. after taking this, nothing all day and I expected more. Maybe it\u2019s because I am currently on my period but unsure. I will keep trying them for the rest of the week to make sure since my period is almost over. I will say it has helped tremendously with making bowel movements easier because of the lubricant it helps my body produce but that\u2019s all. I have also noticed that even while drinking all that water last few days, I\u2019ve barely gone to the bathroom to pee as much as I would\u2019ve if I had not been taking these pills.",
