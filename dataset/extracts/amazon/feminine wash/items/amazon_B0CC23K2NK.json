                "reviewText": "I purchased this as a general mild wash soap and it is just that. My only problem with it is the fragrance. Usually feminine products are nicely scented and lighter. This lavender is very strong in a masculine way and smells bad. It smells like a too heavy men's cologne. I think something powdery smelling and light might have been more appropriate considering who and what this is intended for. Works fine but the smell makes me avoid using it.",
