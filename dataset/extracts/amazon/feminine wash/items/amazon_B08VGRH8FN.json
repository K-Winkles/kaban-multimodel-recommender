It isnt thick like liquid soap, but it does lather good enough forming lots of bubbles. Maybe its better thin consistency, for intimate parts. Good for sensitive skin. I have seen others write that they use it all over face and body. I haven't, but do want to try on my face as well. Overall I am satisfied and will probably buy again.",

                "reviewText": "Who knew that something like this Intimate Wash for Women would be so important! Being an oldster, and now having a slight incontinence problem, the idea of \"keeping it fresh\" and odor-free is very important. This product is quite nice, it's a medium pink liquid in a clear plastic 4.05 oz. bottle with built-in pump in the lid, and with a paper label all around the bottle. When the liquid is pumped out it becomes a pure white sudsy foam that dissipates quickly when applied to the area. There's a lovely soft rose/floral scent that doesn't last long. There are more very good ingredients listed, and it can be used as often as needed. The instructions say to wet the area first, apply gently, let set for about 25 - 45 seconds, and rinse. Easy to use, leaves a nice clean and confidant odor-free area, plus there's the benefit of the good pH balance to keep everything healthy! There's no soap, just a very fine cleansing combination.",

                "reviewText": "The Skin Elements Intimate wash came well packaged with a cap and pump dispenser. My wife tried it and liked how soft and soothing it was on her skin. It comes out as a foamy wash that quickly dissipates once applied. There was no irritation. It's PH balanced and includes rose water, chamomile floral water, calendula flower extract, witch hazel extract, aloe vera leaf extract and tea tree oil etc.. There's also \"fragrance\" and amaranth dye (color C.l. 16185), found in food and cosmetics. The dye has not been approved by the US FDA. It's strongly floral, so if fragrance in an intimate wash is not your thing, you may want to skip this one.Made in India~ Kort",

                "reviewText": "This feminine women\u2019s intimate wash does a nice job of cleaning and is gentle and nondrying. I like that this product works to keep a normal pH down there. It smells very nice and definitely smells like roses. I like the the ingredients are mostly clean. However I\u2019m not a big fan that it has fragrance, as they usually contain Phthalates. I like the foam dispenser as it\u2019s easier to control how much comes out of the container. I like that this can remove any unwanted odor and itching and also has antibacterial properties. Nice cleanser for LadyBits.",
