I bought the rose one because I love the smell of roses it came in a little cute packaging but it did not smell like roses it had like one little rose petal in it I looked a bit funky but I still called it cute to hype it up. I tried it and I didn't notice until maybe within the first three days of using it I caught a bacterial infection down there and now it's been like almost three weeks and I still have that bacterial infection. not knowing where the infection came from I was still using the oil But I did start using it on and off, I'd skip a day.. I didn't wanna give up because I was planning on having sex soon and I wanted to see if it worked, well I went to the doctor today and I have some kind of infection that my white blood cells are trying to fight \ud83d\udc31 \ud83e\udd4a so I'm just gonna assume because I haven't had sex while using this product and I keep myself clean pretty well that the oil gave me a UTI or something. So don't waste your money on it. But I'm glad others like it I really had good hopes for it. Let me know if you had the same problem..",
