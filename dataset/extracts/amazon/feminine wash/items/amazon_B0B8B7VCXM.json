                "reviewText": "Extremely gentle. Works for general preventative hygiene and care beyond the prescribed use. Me and my younger daughters all use this cleanser on our girl parts due to the fact that lysine and lemon balm keep UTI bacteria at bay (which is pretty common in little girls especially if they don\u2019t hydrate well or hold their urine too long repeatedly) and help prevent other bacterial infections in this area (also common in preschool-aged kids when they are learning to wipe themselves\u2026 they aren\u2019t always the most hygenic).It\u2019s actually difficult to find a feminine cleanser without sulfates or harsh ingredients\u2026 even natural soaps can create a burning sensation down there, especially for little ones. This one has all natural ingredients, no fragrance, is ph appropriate for the area and contains several ingredients which are neutralizing to potentially harmful bacteria. It\u2019s also non-drying.I love this product and keep it in every shower. A tiny amount goes a long way. About half a dime-sized amount is about all you need.",

So far, the wash has really helped with reducing the severity and duration of flare-ups. The last time I had a flare-up, I used both the wash and ointment. It only lasted three days. So far this is a good addition to my normal medication routine. I can't speak for anyone else but this does work for me. I believe it is worth the price.",
