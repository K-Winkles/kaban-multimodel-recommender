                "reviewText": "This bottle is much bigger than I had thought it would be. It really does hold 17 ounces of liquid.It's well-made and doesn't have any sharp or unfinished spots. The two pieces fit together well and the nozzle fits tightly onto the bottle with very little turning needed. One quick twist to the left and it's on. The collar of the nozzle is 2\" (5.08 cm) across, which helps to make it easy to grip for folks with hand issues. And removing the nozzle is just a quick turn to the right.The hourglass shape and the ribbing on the sides provide good grip so the bottle won't slip out of your hand while using it. It's soft and easy to squeeze (it kind of reminds me of the way a silicone hot water bottle feels) and the water squirts upward a couple of inches, giving you a nice little shower. It doesn't take much pressure to get some good amount of water-flow from it, either.The parts are easy to clean with warm water and soap. A standard bottle-brush fits inside the bottle and a straw-cleaning brush fits inside the nozzle.The pouch was a nice touch by the manufacturer. It's water-proof, which is terrific for travel, although I'd recommend emptying the bottle before packing it inside of a suitcase. The pouch is also plain white, which is good for privacy. Its cord comes with a squeeze fastener, which is quick to use without having to worry about tying or untying it if you're in a public restroom or in a hurry.The box it comes in has instructions on it, which are much appreciated. One thing that they mention is that you shouldn't squeeze the bottle until it's in position so that you don't get your clothes wet. They're right, but even if you don't squeeze it, there will be a bit of water that comes out the moment you tip the bottle, so you'll either want to put your finger along the openings and hold it there until you've got it in a position where you can let go without worrying about a bit of water coming out or wait to tip the bottle until it's over the toilet and not over your clothing.I would highly recommend this to any new mother as a very soothing way to help with recovery after giving birth. I'd also highly recommend it to any woman who would like to feel fresh and clean as part of every bathroom visit.",

                "reviewText": "It isn't a replacement for an official bidet - I wouldn't call it a portable bidet. I wouldn't say it can effectively replace toilet paper or wipes - I can say that it squirts water. I tried it on the toilet, tried it in the shower to have more angles, filled, refilled, and it can't replace the use of TP or wipes sometime. I do agree that it is more hygienic than TP or wipes at times. You can't travel with it full as it would squirt out. You really can't place it back in the travel bag and leave it there as it may not dry sufficiently and moisture/mold inside the bottle would defeat the purpose of it helping to clean. With all things - use it for what it is: a squirt bottle to use now and then. It will be in my assortment of sitz bath, wipes, TP, and my shower spray hose and this for options to clean various areas.",

                "reviewText": "The bottle has a good amount of flex to squeeze a steady flow, and a soft stream to a heavier stream depending on how hard you squeeze and what you prefer. Great for postpartum delivery, and to have on hand if there is ever a toilet paper shortage. You can use this with tap water or stream water if out camping or on a road trip, or you can use warm water if you prefer. Make a nice gift for a mother to be at a baby shower or upon the arrival of their new baby, to help with recovery downstairs. This is very gentle on the lady parts that have had tearing or stitches. Also useful for those who have swollen veins on the behind, or have been sick and had acidic stools where wiping would hurt. Using this portable bidet will help comfort anyone with downstairs issues. Or anyone who just wants to feel fresh. Great way to reduce the use of toilet paper too.",

                "reviewText": "As a mother of whirlwind 'monsters' who effortlessly build indoor mud pools and splash zones, any point in time is a potential disaster. Amid this chaos, I found the OFFO peri bottle to be an unexpected superhero! Initially, purchased for personal use postpartum, this gem of a product has niftily taken on additional roles like Mr. Incredible on steroids.Its large capacity of 17 ounces means less refills and more 'action' in one go. Whether it's cleaning their muddy marvels or soothing my 'down under' after birthing another monster-minion, this peri bottle is a pro at targeting not just the right spots, but those right-out-of-reach spots too.The non-slippery, soft stripes wrapping the bottle is just the cherry on the top! Perfect for those days when your hands are as slick as a butter-fingered circus performer. Add in the fact that my adorable hoard of mini-monsters can't squish it out of shape? Priceless!And if you're an on-the-go mom like me, the accompanying waterproof travel bag is a super convenient extra. Let's be real, my circus doesn't just happen at home - the big-top travels! So here's to the OFFO Peri Bottle - no more 'down under' blunders, or muddy marvels, for this crazed ringmaster-mom! Will I recommend it? Faster than you can say 'ta-da!'",
