I\u2019ve been using HoneyPot and I love it and have no issues but decided just to try something else and I really wish I hadn\u2019t! It wasn\u2019t in the shower that it caused issues but once I was out and drying it felt like I had a yeast infection kind of burn. I tried it 2x just to be sure it wasn\u2019t something else and it\u2019s definitely the wash. I got a refund and won\u2019t be using this anymore! Ouch!",
