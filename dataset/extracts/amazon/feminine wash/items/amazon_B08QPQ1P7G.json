This product is a clear liquid that when applied in the shower takes care of vaginal odor for the entire day. I did discover I did need to use it daily but there is no irritation and no odor. It is cold to apply but I deal with that. The price is cheaper than other brands and it does contain Boric Acid. This bottle last at least 2 months.",
