                "reviewText": "I gave this 4 stars because the picture shows a clear liquid, but it\u2019s actually more of a yellow colour which was off putting at first.As for the item itself, it\u2019s phenomenal. It has a scent-neutralizing effect, getting rid of any odour. It feels soothing and cleansing which is exactly what you want for an intimate wash. This plus moisturizing with jojoba oil afterwards has my lady bits feeling soft, supple, smooth and so, so, so clean. Highly recommend making this a staple in your self-care routine.",
