Yes it did burn to me and I had to rinse really well but after about 2-3 days it wasn\u2019t irritating anymore. I like it because i stay fresh and it comes unscented. The only thing that has deferred me is the price but for how long it last (about 3 months for me) I can live with it. This soap lathers really well and comes out as a foam. I use half a pump per wash and usually wash up about 3 times before getting out the shower. I\u2019ve found that a full pump is almost too soapy/bubbly and wasteful since I only use it on my lady bits \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I used summers eve, unscented before this and liked it but I definitely prefer this and wouldn\u2019t go back. I don\u2019t know what it is that causes the burning the first 2-3 days because I\u2019ve never experienced that but as long as I rinsed well it would stop within mins of me getting out of the shower. It never left any rashes or redness or anything like that. And again I have no irritation at all now. I would try it. I didn\u2019t realize I have been using this since 2018 until I came to buy another bottle and decided to leave a review, so this is definitely a staple for me",
