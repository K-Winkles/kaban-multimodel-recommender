Started taking Probiotics supplements etc. I chalked it up as hormone change since I crossed over the 40 hump but I still didn't like it. I'm so hygiene self conscious.Anyways. I received my soap and used it the same day... wa~la... body orders gone. I was still skeptical thinking it would be temporary but 1 week in... and I'm VERY PLEASED with this product. It is the truth and I will be ordering more when I run out!",
