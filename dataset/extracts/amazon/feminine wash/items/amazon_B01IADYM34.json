                "reviewText": "Been using this product for years, the product itself is great, can be diluted due to how concentrated it is and can last longer, dime size amount out of the bottle is all you need, should you decide not to dilute it. Amazon delivered everything in tact at a great rate within a reasonable amount of time. Ladies, summers Eve has nothing on Lemisol..",
