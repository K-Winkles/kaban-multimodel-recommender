So by that time, I had found another formula by Honepot, and even though it couldn\u2019t compare to this brand, I still felt it was a decent substitute. So I come across this one day when I was looking for another brand of feminine wash and immediately added it to my cart. I love how subtle the smell of this is, but still has a sweet and refreshing scent. A little bit goes a long way and it lasts much longer than the HP. It\u2019s mild and gentle, so I never have to worry about irritation or throwing off my pH. I see that the bar is also available on here, so I\u2019ll be purchasing both again, very soon.",

I think the pH was too high and so I was noticing odor as the day went on.This stuff works! I don\u2019t notice much of an odor even at the end of the day. It smells pleasant but not overpowering and the fragrance doesn\u2019t stick to you.",
