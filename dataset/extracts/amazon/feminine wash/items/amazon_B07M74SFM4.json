The product is made in France, it's a Belgian company.It seems that so many Europeans have a better understanding in terms of skin care. A woman's intimate area has a different pH and requires a different cleanser for optimal health. The key word is optimal, of course other soaps and cleansers aren't going to hurt you.That being said I really like using a product like this that I know is not going to have any irritation. If you're the certain person that can't take bubble baths because they will irritate you, and you need unscented soaps for your intimate area, you're going to love this cleanser. It's not one of those ones that gets all foamy and gets bubbles in your, well, places where you don't want bubbly irritants. I've traced a UTI back to a perfumed soap.Great list of ingredients including botanicals.",

It\u2019s advertised as having three floral water (damask rose, chamomile and sage) ingredients as well as two oils (tea tree and lavender), so you\u2019d think there would be some scent. To me it\u2019s odorless. I\u2019ll use this up, but will return to less expensive hygiene products that work just as well, but also provide soft feminine scents.",
