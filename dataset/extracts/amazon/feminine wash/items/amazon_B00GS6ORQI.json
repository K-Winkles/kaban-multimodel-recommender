                "reviewText": "This is possibly the most effective body wash I've ever used. I'm 33 years old. It's the first time that I didn't feel it necessary to cover myself head to toe in body lotion after getting out of the shower. My skin is super smooth and soft as soon as I stepped out of the shower with no body grease or oils left anywhere and no dead skin left behind. I've been trying to use lotion after lotion to make my skin feel the best that it can and it turns out all I had to do was strike it lucky with a body wash that didn't offend my skin. I have eczema and live in the north. Our cold weather dries out skin really easily and my sensitive skin doesn't mix well with basically any other body wash that I've tried. I also, admittedly, have a problem with overly powerful BO. I'm not entirely sure what's causing it (undiagnosed medical issue maybe?), but this body wash completely neutralizes all the odor each morning. While I haven't had to deal with 90 degree and up weather yet this year, so far this formula of body wash has already cut down on the stink problems that I have. It's my new shower staple and will save me money on lotion too since I no longer need it for my entire body.There's one drawback though and it's almost enough to make me not want to use it even though the functionality is extremely good. The scent is absolutely overwhelming for me. I have a very diminished sense of smell and struggle to detect anything unless it's a skunk, gasoline, burning matches, and so forth. This body wash smell is SO over the top that I get overwhelmed by it in the shower. I have no idea how people with a normal sense of smell can deal with this. The smell isn't one that I like either. I can't quite describe it other than very \"girly\" maybe like flowers or a general perfume or something. Since I'm unfamiliar with most smells, I can't accurately describe the scent to you and I'm sorry.I very much wish they'd make an unscented or odorless version of this body wash. The other body washes this company makes may smell better (I haven't tried them), but they aren't the same \"Odor Block\" formula as far as I can tell and this function is a necessity for me given my odor problems. It works EXTREMELY well for what I need, but the smell is almost too much for me. I don't want to have an overwhelming body odor in either direction, either smelling bad or smelling like girly flower stuff. If I ever get a roommate, I'd like to not overwhelm them with the smell of this by stinking up the entire apartment with it. I would very much rather be as close to odorless as possible. If they ever make an odorless formula of this product, I'll be a lifetime customer.I gave it 4 out of 5 stars simply because of the smell problem. If I was exclusively evaluating the performance of the body wash, it would be a full 5 out of 5 stars easily and without hesitation. This is an excellent body wash. The smell is just too much for me to overlook in my rating though.",

V wash, clean n dry bd peesafe are ni things but liquid soap.Going to a bit higher range, i thought expensive products should be giving results,I used to sirona after trimming my v-part, IT HURT SO MUCH. So, no no.Then I found this Indian brand, Terrai, more premium range promising best outcome, i even hAd a conversation wd the founder of the firm and she assured me that i wont be disappointed.I used Terrai, it gave me burning sensation. I contacted the founder to let her knoe that her product is HARMFUL and specially for sensitive ones, she said she\u2019ll ship another one wd different formula but she never did.So, after much research , I found vagisil.Nd God ! It\u2019s amazing !Indian products are zero. Unfortunately, nobody has worked hard to make good intimate wash in the country.Vagisil is imported but it is definitely the product which is honest and gives results and is harmless.BUT IT !",
