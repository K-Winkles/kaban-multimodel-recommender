I only use it for my face, though with the amount of lather I get on my hands, I can wash my chest too. I use this in the shower after using a separate make up remover. I\u2019m super pleased!!I bought this specifically because I wanted a pH balanced bar soap for my face. I prefer bar soaps because they are less wasteful but I cannot use regular soap on my face, it destroys the acid mantle of my facial skin and I get so flaky and sensitive! I just got this and it feels great. No problems so far, I will update if I start to experience any issues.One problem is I ordered \u2018unscented\u2019 and got \u2018lavender sage\u2019 instead. I\u2019m using it anyway because the scent is subtle and natural.",

I\u2019ve tried various Lume products over the years and they all smelled so bad, that I felt \u201cWhat's the point ?\u201d But this product smells great, lathers well, and I stay completely clean smelling between showers ( every 24 hours. ) I hesitated to spend $20 on a bar of soap, but its confidence and security in a bar. I\u2019m interested to see how long the bar lasts. I keep it out of the water with a soap magnet.",

                "reviewText": "So. I have been a stinky person all my life. Even as a little kid, I remember my parents having to spray me with deodorant spray after my shower because I was stinky. I have always had to use an antibacterial deodorant soap when showering or else I am gross within a couple hours, even with deodorant/antiperspirant deodorant. I could never just use a pretty scented body wash or moisturizing soap without running the risk of smelling bad soon after. I often shower multiple times a day because I just like to be and feel as fresh as I can. I was hoping this soap would work to keep me feeling fresh for a longer duration of time. I have to say, I think it does help. I noticed no irritation or dryness when I used it, and the unscented soap just made me smell clean. I think it did help keep my stank at bay. I would not say my BO was eliminated, but reduced. But I honestly cannot get over the price. My first bar, I used up in like not even 10 days. My second bar, I cut in half because I was trying to make it last longer, but it didn\u2019t last much more that way. I have a hard time with the idea that I\u2019m literally putting $15 in soap down the drain in a little more than a week. I do think it works, but I don\u2019t know if I can adopt it for everyday use at this price\u2026 I can get enough trusty, gold antibacterial soap for my entire household for MONTHS for the same price as one bar of this soap. I think this soap does help battle BO, but it sure puts a whoopin on the wallet! Thanks.",
