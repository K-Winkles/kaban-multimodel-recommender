                "reviewText": "I have to be careful with most products I use. I can\u2019t use normal shower washes on my bits as everything makes me sore after a while so I have changed to sensitive feminine washes. This one is nice. It\u2019s a fairly thick, clear, gel that lathers well. You don\u2019t need a lot to produce a lather but you do need a very gentle squeeze so as not to squirt out too much. It\u2019s a light scent that reminds me of coconut but not overpowering, almost scent free. It works well for me. Doesn\u2019t sting, keeps me clean and I\u2019m happy to use. I prefer this to cannesten wash as it\u2019s much less scented.",

A gynecologist had recommended it to me years ago, because of the low pH which is normal for that part of the body. Other similar products have higher pH level which can get the balance off and make you more prone to infections.",

I\u2019ve never suffered from it before and l was surprised at how little help there is. Water only is suggested, without going into tmi this cannot provide the necessary level of hygiene required for some people. I find l can use this wash on all but the area that remains sensitive, but l would not have been able to use it when l still had thrush. So it\u2019s not what l am looking for but would probably suit others, l am still looking for an un intimate wash that is not scented.",
