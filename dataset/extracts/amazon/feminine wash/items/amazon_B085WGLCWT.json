I've been a fan of this product for a while not, its good for sensitive skin and no weird fruity smells... I mean it smells like it supposed to smell, nothing fancy. Best part is that it takes very good care of your lady bits.The freshness pretty much last all day, cant really say anything beyond that since I have the bad habit of taking a shower on a daily basis... I know right, how weird. Anyways, if you want to treat your kitty cat right this is a great product to keep it classy and clean ladies.P.S husband approved.",
