                "reviewText": "Honey Pot is a weird name for feminine intimate products. Aside from that, I like how clean it makes me feel. Recommended by my Ob/Gyn. Vaginally for years I have been extremely irritated and acidic. Turns out I should have listened to avoid using regular body wash on my sensitive area. She doesn't like it! Three pumps per shower restores pH balance and makes you smell and feel incredibly clean. No more random itching or burning to make you swear another yeast infection is coming on! I just wish the pump was bigger. I like the wipes as an additional cleansing wipe after using the restroom.",
