It will not leave a lingering scent (nor should it!) but it's nice to have it in the shower. It lathers. It cleans. It's nice. I've never encountered any health concerns from this product like I have with others in the past.Keep in mind, though this is a gentle soap and may be suitable for women with sensitivities, it will not be suitable for all women. If your doctor told you to stay away from feminine washes, please listen to them! Soaps, even gentle ones, can disrupt the natural balances of microbiota and lead to UTIs or vaginal infections.",
