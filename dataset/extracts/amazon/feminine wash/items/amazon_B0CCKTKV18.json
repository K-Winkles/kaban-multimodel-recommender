It has an amazing very light fragrance that lasts for days. I used the soap first, then I followed with the gel wash and ended with the oil. It left me feeling fresh and very clean. The oil moisturizes the vulva and leaves a very natural fruit like aroma, nothing strong. For women over 50, this product leaves you fresh with no dryness. I also highly recommend this product for young ladies coming of age that can use something sensative, fresh, and natural. I will continue to buy this product from now on for my feminine wash. This is a must buy 100% if your looking for a natural cleaning product for your lady parts.",
