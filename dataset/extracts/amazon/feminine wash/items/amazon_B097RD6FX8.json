                "reviewText": "Ah, the Yoni Soap Bars \u2013 a delightful fragrant journey that left me smelling like a garden of roses but didn't quite deliver the \"Ph Balance\" and \"Vaginal Deodorants\" experience I was hoping for. My curiosity got the best of me, and while it didn't quite live up to my expectations in the nether regions department, it did have its perks.A Symphony of Scents: First off, let's talk about that fragrance \u2013 oh my! It's like being enveloped in a field of blooming flowers every time I lathered up. The scent was so captivating that I practically had my own fan club of admirers commenting on my newfound aroma.The Great Ph Mystery: Now, to the main event \u2013 the whole \"Ph Balance for Women\" and \"Vaginial Deodorants\" claim. Sadly, it was like waiting for a plot twist in a movie that never came. I was expecting a magic wand for my lady parts, but it turned out to be more of a regular soap performance. No pH wizardry here, just your typical cleaning agent.Curiosity Satisfied: I'll admit, I bought this soap out of pure curiosity, hoping for a revolutionary experience. It's like trying a new ice cream flavor and finding out it tastes just like vanilla. While it didn't live up to its bold claims, it did leave me smelling fantastic.False Advertisement Feels: On a personal note, it felt a bit like false advertising. I was hoping for a unique and targeted solution, but it turned out to be a lovely soap with a great scent. If you're looking for a soap that smells divine, this might be it. But for specialized needs, it didn't quite hit the mark.In summary, the Yoni Soap Bars were a fragrant adventure that left me smelling amazing and garnering compliments left and right. However, when it came to the \"Ph Balance\" and \"Vaginal Deodorants\" aspect, it was more of a regular soap experience. It's a three-star rating because while it didn't meet my specific expectations, it did leave me smelling like a rose garden, which isn't half bad!",
