The issue is that the tablets take forever to dissolve. I mean like over an hour. I don\u2019t know if my tablets may be bad because 1 reviewer mentioned something about the tablets fizzing. Mine did not and several other reviewers also mentioned issues with dissolving the tablet.When my tablets did finally dissolve, the solution was not what I expected or hoped for. I was expecting something more like a cream or paste, but the solution was still very fluid\u2026watery. I used a sterile pad to apply. The instructions say to apply and rinse with no mention of how long to wait.After rinsing, I noticed really nothing and the only reason I gave 2 stars, instead of 1, is because I can\u2019t honestly say it did not \u201cincrease skin elasticity\u201d.",

                "reviewText": "I researched JILGYUNGYI and they have been in Korea since 2009 selling mostly feminine hygiene products so they are an established company. I mainly got this to take on trips to freshen up since some of the places I go I might not get a bath or shower every day. These pills would be easy to carry with me and I would not have to carry many since it is only 2 tablets 1-2 times a week.Luckily I read the reviews about the difficulty dissolving the pills so I was ready for that issue. I used a pill cutter to cut the pills up into quarters. Then I used very hot water right out of the tap. Using this method and stirring a couple of times it took 5 minutes for the pills to completely dissolve. By then the water had cooled down enough that I was able to splash the mixture to my intimate area. It did not feel anything during the application of the product. After doing the rinse twice a week for several weeks I can say that my skin does appear to be smoother and tighter. Maybe it is because I am just paying more attention, but it does seem to make some type of difference. Not sure about any other effects such as odor control, but I did not think I had a particularly bad odor to begin with.So since I had read all the other reviews and warnings about the tablets not dissolving I was able to get around that issue or at least be prepared for it. The product did not cause me any irritation during or after application. Over several weeks the rinse did seem to help my skin as far as being smoother and softer, but I\u2019m not sure about the other claims since I had no such issues to start. I have to say since I was able to get the pills to dissolve and the solution seem to make a positive difference I like the product overall.",

No more lugging around big bottles, these travel-friendly guys fit right in my purse.They clean me up just fine, not too harsh or drying like some things can be. I love that they're pH balanced, keeps things feeling happy and healthy. My only little gripe is they disappear kinda fast, wish they lasted a tad longer.",

Directions say to melt two tablets in warm water. That didn\u2019t work, so I tried extremely hot water\u2014even after ten minutes, the tablets weren\u2019t completely dissolved. Who has that kind of time to add to a morning routine? Even after helping the tablets melt (by swirling/mixing), the whole application process is a messy one with questionable cleansing results.",

But they didn't. It took longer than anticipated for the tablets to dissolve. Not really time saving than buying something already made. I'm not at all sensitive but this actually caused some irritation for me. Could be just me, or some of the ingredients in the tablets...but unfortunately this product is not for me.",
