It does dry you skin out so if you have oily skin I would say this is for you. If your skin is already dry I would suggest using a moisturizer after using this. I love the grapefruit smell it\u2019s not as bad as I thought it would be. Face clearing of dark spots and pimples. I would give it a 5 but I want to see if my face clears more first. I recommend at least trying it for sure. Everyone skin is different",

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t know whether this or good or bad, but the product is very thick and goopy. I guess that helps you not to lose it when you\u2019re bathing, but it also seems like it wastes product. I hope somebody else will discuss this aspect of it.The scent isn\u2019t very heavy and doesn\u2019t stay on me after the shower, which I like. I would prefer unscented, as I use several products in the shower, and their \u201clight scents\u201d all clash and smell acrid when used together.I don\u2019t feel like this really works for my purpose. I have been trying to remember to use this daily on the areas that I shave, but I don\u2019t always remember. There\u2019s a roll-on product that has, among other ingredients, salicylic acid, and it\u2019s supposed to reduce razor bumps and ingrown hairs, but it\u2019s very expensive.I had hoped this soap would be a good alternative, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be working. However, you use that other product twice a day, and I haven\u2019t been using this soap twice a day. So, maybe my review isn\u2019t really fair, but this just isn\u2019t working out for me for this purpose.",
