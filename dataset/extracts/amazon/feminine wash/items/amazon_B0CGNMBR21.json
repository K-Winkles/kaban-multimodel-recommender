Although, it is marketed for a woman's intimate areas this soap is great all over the body.I like the pineapple/ tropical scent. It doesn't linger after my shower, which I actually like as I do not care for over-powering scents if I take a shower before bed.The soap comes with a net that helps create a sudsy lather. It works really well and doubles as a holder for the soap when not in use. (I hang it on the hook with my loofah.) The soap does lather quite well without the net.This soap never dries out my skin and it leaves no residue behind. I live in Minnesota and having something that doesn't dry my skin out in the winter is a must. My skin feels always feels squeaky clean after using it.I have used it on my lady bits and it doesn't irritate my sensitive areas. I am actually sensitive to pineapple when I eat it. (My tongue bleeds.) I didn't have any sensitivity to this soap.I am impressed with this product and I will be reordering it when I run out.",

They look at me like I am crazy, but I really do like it. You put it in the bag and hang it in the shower. When you use you just get the bag wet and lather it up onto your hands, hang the bag back and wash using the suds on your hands. It is a very silky feeling, and I haven't been irritated by it at all. I would recommend it to any women that might be looking for a feminine soap.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice-smelling pineapple scented soap that lathers nicely and comes with a nice mesh bag for storage or to use as a shower scrub. I love the scent and the feel of the soap, but for some reason it's advertised as soap for the female nether parts -- and there's no real reason to segregate it like that.It's a gentle soap, so you could certainly use it \"down there\" as easily as you could use it on your face or anywhere, really. The scent is light and leaves only a trace of scent on the skin. I have pretty sensitive skin and didn't notice any issues when using it.I would recommend this soap to anyone, for any body part, if you like a tropical scent or enjoy a pineapple smell to your shower.",

                "reviewText": "It has a great mild scent and it lathers up great. It came with a mesh bag which makes it easy to hang from the shower caddy and keeps it from laying flat and turning to mush. You can easily lather up from that hanging position and get plenty of suds to apply to its intended target areas. It feels moisturizing and is great from front to back. I\u2019m not much for all kinds of specialized skin care products, i like to keep it clean but simple but this is definitely a product zi will buy again",
