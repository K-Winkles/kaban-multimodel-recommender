This is the first real ingredients product I have come across that I can say ACTUALLY WORKS! I apply externally after a shower & it keeps my hooha smelling great all day. I love that it has witch hazel, which is a great cleanser for the sensitive areas and it helps restore and maintain PH balance which is awesome. The scent is very light I actually like it because I am extra sensitive and can not use anything that smells too strong down there or else it completely throws my PH off. So far I have been using it for 3 weeks and no complaints, no having to reapply throughout the day unless of course after showering, which is great. I am glad I purchased this and cant wait to purchase more.",
