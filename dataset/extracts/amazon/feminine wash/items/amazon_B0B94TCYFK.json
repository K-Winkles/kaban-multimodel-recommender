Not sure what the big fuss is about the packaging \u201chard to open\u201d, it makes sense the way they packaged it as it needs to be contained in a tight foil package for sanitary purposes and to prevent any punctures, leaks, or from drying out. In my opinion the package is not a big deal. Highly recommend!",
