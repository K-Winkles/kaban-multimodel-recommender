I bathe daily after workouts or sweat-inducing physical labor, and there is no scent at all 24 hours later....not even normal healthy cooter aroma. I also use it to wash my pits, and I never get gamey anymore, like...EVER! I'm setting this up on subscribe & save so I can share it with my husband. He bathes at least twice daily because he hates when his pits smell, in his words, \"all oniony\". I just won't tell him it's a wash for girly bits ;)",

I always feel fresh and clean without feeling dry or irritated after each use. I've received bottles with 2 different packaging methods and will say that i wish the company would come up with a safe and convenient method for packaging. One of the packaging designs I received had a plastic piece that was inserted into the bottle to keep the liquid safe and from spilling during shipping. The design could be better designed because the plastic can be rather difficult to remove. The other packaging type I recieved had a piece of tape on the outside of the bottle to keep the top from opening. However, the top could easily be unscrewed and the product could be tampered with.",
