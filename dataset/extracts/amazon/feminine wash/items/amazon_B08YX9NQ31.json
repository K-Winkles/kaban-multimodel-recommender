                "reviewText": "This smells great. I took the label off the front though because it\u2019s a bit risqu\u00e9 to have just sitting in my bathroom. lol mentions some sexual things. It peels off super easy and the petals in the oil are so pretty I prefer having it off.The smell is strong with the lemon scent but doesn\u2019t smell too citrus forward, it\u2019s a nice light clean smell.As for the effects it claims to have, I haven\u2019t experienced any of them but I will say it does help a lot with razor burn and just general aftershave issues.",

                "reviewText": "Loved it, it last all day especially the Lemongrass one. That was my first choice, I finished it and I decided to try the Peach, just because my hubby dosent like the smell of Lemongrass. However I loved it! It's a strong smell at first he ask if I had Vicks on . The peachy on smell just like it, however it dosent last long, also it mix in your ur musk and it just smells weird can't describe it. With Lemongrass scent it dosent matter how many hrs went by it sell like that. Peach is more for intimacy time!!",
