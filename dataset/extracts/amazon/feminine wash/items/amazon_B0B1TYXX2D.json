                "reviewText": "Update: 1/24/2024: Since my last update, I did some more reading about 2-Nonenal and how to get rid of the smell. Others said Persimmon soap would do the trick. So again, I go to Amazon to find it. I did find it, purchased it and tried it. It\u2019s a very very expensive, tiny little piece of glycerin soap. Smells good. Does it work? Yes but for about 8 hours. Then you have to use it again. Lume controls the odor much longer and Lume bar of soap lasts longer. If you like citrus smell, get Lume tangerine. It\u2019s cheaper, larger, lasts longer and works longer.Update: 1/4/2024:Since my last update, I ordered the Peony Rose and the Tangerine. The coconut smell started getting to me. When first applied, cream or soap, it reminded me of men\u2019s dirty socks. Not feminine at all! Of course that initial stinky smell dissipates but I just couldn\u2019t get past it. So I\u2019ve tried both the peony rose and tangerine. Both smell really good. Believe it or not, my husband likes the peony rose the best. It leaves a smell similar to CK One on him. I\u2019m sure body chemistry comes into play here but on him it doesn\u2019t leave him smelling of flowers. On me, both leave a light pleasant scent. People won\u2019t smell it on you unless they are literally sniffing your skin.The soap works just fine by itself for 2-Nonenal.Update: 12/26/23I tested using only the soap and it works! For me, at this point and time, no need to use both the soap and the cream. Saves me a little time in my hygiene routine and a little bit of money too.Original Review:I\u2019m going to put my tragic but true story out here in hopes it helps someone. Move on to the next review if you are sensitive to the truth and facts about aging or just squeamish.Growing up I spent a lot of time with my grandmother. I always noticed her house had this certain smell and I knew it came from her but never knew what it was. I definitely knew it was a natural smell, not a perfume, lotion or detergent. It was a sweet but earthy kind of smell. Whatever it was, I knew I didn\u2019t want it.Fast forward 43 years and here I am post menopause. I still get a little hot flash now and then but I\u2019m definitely through the turbulence. Praise Jesus!The other morning, I was sitting in bed with my morning cup of coffee perusing on Amazon like I always do, and I could smell this sweet, musty, salty something odor coming off my neck and chest. I was like, WTH!, but in much worse language. I religiously shower 2x a day. I never get in my bed dirty. NEVER. And all of a sudden, I\u2019m waking up with this strange odor on my body. The idea of it tormented me all day. Next morning, same problem. \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29. So over to the internet I go to try to diagnose my problem. Well, guess what? I\u2019ve hit an all time low in my life! I officially have Old People Smell or scientifically called, 2-Nonenal. Welcome to my dark side, folks!So back to Amazon I go to find a product to cure me. I came across Lume. I even saw the tv commercial for the all body soap and deodorant. I purchased both. Last night I showered with the soap and made sure I got my back and all the cracks and crevices. I put the cream on my neck and chest. I went to bed, said my prayers, asked God to take away the old people smell. \ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f.So here I am, the next morning, sitting in bed with my morning coffee and writing this review. So! How do I smell this morning? Like a coconut. No old people smell. I only smell of coconut. Lume worked!Would it work for a solid 72 hours? Don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care because I bathe 2x day minimum. I will use the soap and cream daily.It sucks getting old. Your joints wear out, skin dries out, and now we\u2019re doomed to get 2-Nonenal.Mentally I still feel like I\u2019m in my early 40\u2019s. Physically, I feel like my actual age of 58. But I REFUSE to smell like an old person. REFUSE! REFUSE! REFUSE!Pros:-Bar of soap is quite sizable and will last awhile.-It works for 2-Nonenal and possibly other reasons for body odorCons:-Tube of body cream is rather small but you don\u2019t need much as it spreads well-Products are pricey but how can you put a price on something that gets rid of 2-Nonenal?So this is my wicked little story. I hope it helps someone and my apologies if I grossed you out.",

                "reviewText": "Sometimes I like strong smelling soaps and sometimes I don\u2019t care for it. I do like that you don\u2019t -need- it to be a strong scent because it helps to keep the BO away. I put this inside a scrubber and it\u2019s honestly a great combo with the other LUME products. This is my new daily soap and I definitely recommend it. It doesn\u2019t dry out the skin like other bars. I use this with the acidified body wash for the privates and face. It\u2019s the best combo in hygiene. The lume deodorant on top of that makes it all the trifecta. Even if you don\u2019t use other lume products, I still recommend this for your daily soap needs. My skin is clean, soft, and amazing for it.",

                "reviewText": "So as we age we gain a smell that seems to never go away with regular soap. This soap takes that smell away and when you smell it again it\u2019s a wonderful indicator to get them another shower to apply the soap barrier again. I would scrub my bathroom and look for the smell and then I saw this on a commercial and bought it. Like night and day with mom. It\u2019s great for her skin. It does not dry her out and is a great moisture riser as well and it suds up well too. Works great in her soap bag and is very durable. Talking about this today on our moms social media (FB) caregiver page, \u201cThe Linda Mae Way\u201d. Thank you for making this product.",
