Plus just seemed a little sketched in the packaging Not understanding how something so fragrant isn\u2019t going to mess up your pH or Cause burning . So I\u2019m glad I got to try this again and this time I got a two pack of the yang Yang it\u2019s not my favorite smell for sure but it is quite pleasant in this particular brand. I use it after the shower and really transforms the way you smell. I also last! The smell sticks with you! Makes you feel more confident fresh out of the shower with your partner or after the gym. I am extremely sensitive with my pH. Everything will throw me off. This has not been a problem at all while using this and I\u2019m at almost the two week mark daily. And I haven\u2019t even made a dent in one of the bottles! I will be buying more",

I think it's delightful.It does indeed take care of your \"sacred petals,\" (love that euphemism!)I'm postmenopausal, and this is very comforting. It alleviates dryness and soothes irritation.It is not a \"spray,\" it is in a bottle with an eyedropper - you dispense a few drops and apply to skin.It is not greasy or oily - it soaks right into your skin. I feels really good on my hands, too.You can also drop a few drops in your bath as bath oil. So versatile.It is all natural organic ingredients, and also has tea tree oil, which is a natural antibacterial.This is an excellent product, and I am happy that I discovered it!",

                "reviewText": "When I ordered this oil, my eyes had focused only on the \"Ylang-Ylang Essential Oil\" portion of the title. Ylang-ylang is one of my favorite scents, so I ordered this item. Turns out that yoni oil is not the sort of essential oil that is intended for use in a diffuser. I realized that after I placed the order, but before the product arrived. I figured that I could use this product as a skin moisturizer or similar, so I wasn't very concerned until I actually received the product.I attached several pics of the product so you can see it for yourself. The bottles do not have any sort of safety seal on them. This is a deal breaker for me. I am not putting anything on or in my body, or in the air I breathe, that does not arrive with the factory seal fully intact.There is also a second deal breaker - take a look at the ingredient list. It only purports to list the \"main ingredients\"! A product like this should list ALL ingredients.So, sadly, this oil went in the bin. I couldn't think of a use for it that seemed safe, given that it arrived unsealed and without anything purporting to be a complete ingredient list.On the plus side, this oil smells good. The ylang-ylang scent isn't dominant, but surprisingly I was OK with that. The scent is a nice well-balanced smell. I would definitely have found some way to use the oil, given its good smell, if it weren't for the two deal breakers mentioned above.",

                "reviewText": "I use all kinds of oils on my skin & hair. I'd never bothered with anything specifically labeled \"yoni oil\" but I took a chance with this. I'M SO GLAD I DID!!!! It's a great oil, and it smells so incredibly good.I can't say it performs better than other oils, but honestly, the scent is what has me hooked. I use it in my hair, along my neck, pretty much anywhere that needs some moisture. No issues with irritation anywhere I've applied it.Good stuff! Try it!",

                "reviewText": "This 2 pack of Yoni Ylang-Yang Essential Oil has a nice flowery aroma. Come with 2 separate larger bottles of oil with droppers. Used, not as intended, in an essential oil fan diffuser and has a nice clean flowery aroma. Can be used as intended with 1 to 2 drops on feminin pad for a clean scent. Had to use more than what was suggested for the aroma to hit the scenses just right. Is more watery than pure essential oil.",
