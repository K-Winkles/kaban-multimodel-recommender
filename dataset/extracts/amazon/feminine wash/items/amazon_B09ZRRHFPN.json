I was skeptical but when I got this dry oil it was mesmerizing! The Yoni oil is also spectacular and offers a little tingle when you put it on, but quickly dissipates. The yoni oil keeps that yoni fresh and clean. I actually mix the yoni oil and rose oil for that absolutely refreshing yoni moment!",

That leads me to believe it is not the freshest batch. (If the manufacturer is reading this- shame on you for sending me nearly expired product).My second issue is the pretty flower bits in the oil. Very decorative, but not good if you are applying directly to the skin- they are sharp and abrasive.The oil itself is light, absorbs well and has a lighter, more floral scent than I thought it would. I thought it would be more overwhelming rose.I will keep it, use it, and beware of the scratchy bits.If the manufacturer wants to send me a fresher bottle, feel free to do so. I almost returned this one because of the batch date.",
