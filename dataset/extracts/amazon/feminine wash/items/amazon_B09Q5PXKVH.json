One day, I saw a video with Dr. Klara Senior and Dr. Sofia Herrera and decided to buy the Feminine Foam Cleanser. At first, I thought it was a little expensive, but I said to myself, let me give it a try because I could not stand the itchiness, bad odor and constant gynecologist visits so they could tell me that there is nothing wrong, that I had no infection and that everything was fine. I kept thinking, how is everything okay? I am always dealing with itchiness and bad odor, this doesn't make sense. Fast forward to a week after using the Feminine Foam Cleanser with Hyaluronic Acid, the itchiness and bad odor disappeared! Thanks to both doctors who created these products! They really do work and the Feminine Foam Cleanser is not expensive to me anymore because it lasts a very long time, and the best part is that all my discomfort is completely gone!",
