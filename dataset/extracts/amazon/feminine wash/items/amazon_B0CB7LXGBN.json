                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Netherlands product of high quality",
                "reviewText": "The Dutch have made this premium men's hygiene product.It comes with remarkable packaging that makes it a fabulous gift. It's quite sturdy and masculine looking. There's a subtle smell of coconut and chamomile. However, it does not have any soap, parabens, or artificial colors.You should use it every day to clean your private parts. Just lather it up and rinse it thoroughly with warm water. It is pH balanced and is unlikely to produce any type of allergic reaction. Although it is a bit expensive, you will not be using too much of it every day and it's safe to use on your manhood. I hope the photos are helpful.",

                "reviewText": "This product looked promising and the the packaging was really nice but I was disappointed. The sent is nice but you can barely smell it and it doesn\u2019t last very long and it doesn\u2019t lather good especially with a wash cloth . I had to use about 10 pumps to lather enough to wash with so the bottle will be done really quick and the price is a bit too much in my opinion.",
