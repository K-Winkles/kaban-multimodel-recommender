Print is ready to read and understand so i was able to know if the product was right for me. You only need a small amount of the gel like consistency. I wanted to try this product because its created for sensitive areas and I find other products used to be too harsh. There's no burning or uncomfortable feeling on my skin. I feel really clean and fresh afterwards and it has a lovely soft lavender scent. I will be adding this to my regular shopping list and have recommended it to my family.",
