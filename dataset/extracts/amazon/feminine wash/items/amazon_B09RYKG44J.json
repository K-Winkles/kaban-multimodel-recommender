                "reviewText": "I am very sensitive to what I use down there but, found that the pH-D products work very well for balancing my pH level. Iv'e used the sensitive foam wash and it worked like a dream. I was hoping the same for this scent. It smells amazing but, the pump didn\u2019t work so I really couldn\u2019t use it. I have other foam washes and tried to just replace the pump with one of those tops and it still didn\u2019t work. I think it is the formula itself that is locking up the pump somehow. If that problem would be fixed I would give it 5/5 stars.",

I feel so clean down there & even less leaking throughout the day, I guess because it\u2019s balancing things lol. No idea! But I know I\u2019ll definitely subscribe to get it every month. I\u2019ve had it for two months now, and I\u2019m still on the same bottle!",
