It helps keep things moisturized, but it also helps with thigh rubbing pain.This peach scent is ok - peach isn\u2019t my favorite - but as far as scents go, it is good (scent is so personal!). The scent lingers long enough for feel fresh, but not overpowering or fake smelling.This one is a bit more expensive than others I have used (I typically spend $7-9).Big fan of yoni oil and will happily keep using and buying!",
