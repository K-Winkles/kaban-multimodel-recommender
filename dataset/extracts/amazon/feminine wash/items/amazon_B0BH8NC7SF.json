                "reviewText": "Products like these are hard for me to review when they have ingredients contained in them that I don't want to use, specifically fragrance. Fragrance (or parfum), is a catchall for a myriad of different ingredients, some you might be allergic to. I don't want to risk that, especially in an already sensitive area. There are also some PEGS and and a sulfate type ingredient that makes me a little hesitant. On the plus side, there are some healthy oils in here and a number of natural extracts. But then again, a lot of those might be sensitizing as well. The bottle is pretty and formula a pink gel that definitely smells like a floral perfume a la Bath & Body works....so I'm thinking \"hand wash\" ?!?",

So I never understood why I still had strong orders and my undies always looked bad ( although with a quick Google search it means I have a healthy vag but hated it since it did make me insecure) but now I can officially say, after almost done using this bottle that I'm fixed!",
