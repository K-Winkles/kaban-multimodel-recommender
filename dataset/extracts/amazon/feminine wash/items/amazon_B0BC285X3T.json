Also works great as a body wash for the whole body, though I still use a stronger exfoliating scrub a couple of times a week besides this.Oh! And the lavender vanilla scent is very low-key and more lavendery, which is nice.Definitely becoming a fan of this brand - great quality that delivers what the products claim and the formulas seem clean and transparent.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice, gentle, lightly scented feminine area cleanser, but I only got to use it twice before the pump broke and would not produce any more foam, just dribbles of liquid. Not sure if mine was defective or if this is something inherent in the design of the bottle, but either way, I\u2019m unable to use it anymore.What I liked about this cleanser was that it was moisturizing, non-irritating and that the scent was not too strong. It removes odor and leaves a fresh feeling that lasts most of the day. I would continue to use it if I could figure out how to get the pump to work correctly.",

There's no fragrance to it though there is the scent of the ingredients in the cleanser.I typically use a popular brand that had hilarious commercials online. Still my favorite deodorant but this I prefer over the acidified cleanser. I'm really happy with it. I will be buying again as it eliminates all odors and feels very fresh and really, who doesn't want that?",

She cannot press it down all the way without using both hands while its sitting on the shower floor. And after that, it comes out in liquid form, not foam.This cleanser produces a light, fluffy foam that is easy to use & rinses clean. I tested it on my hand to make sure there wouldn't be any reaction. While gentle on the skin, the lavender vanilla scent is not pleasant at all to me. It smells so weird. Like there is a hint of vinegar to it. That's just my personal experience.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to try this feminine wash because I work in the fitness industry and I'm constantly worried about odor after a good workout. Also, sometimes in the middle of the day, you just want to freshen up without having to take a whole shower. This is a nice, lightweight cleansing foam. While it claims to be unscented, I don't really think there is such a thing as a truly unscented product. I noticed a very light scent, but it smelled fresh and I don't think it would bother even those sensitive to smells. As promised, it's very gentle and didn't cause any irritation or itching. It does naturally eliminate any body odor without perfumes. However, I've tried other similar products that had a long lasting, odor controlling effect. I don't think this product was as effective. That said, it works very well and if you're not sweating in leggings every day, you'll likely be very happy with it.",

I like that it is made with natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals or fragrances. The scent of lavender and vanilla is a lovely combination that adds a nice touch to your feminine routine. The wash is dispensed in the form of a white foam from the pump top of the bottle. The discreet bottle is easy to grasp and the pump functions easily as well. The wash lathers well, keeps you fresh and clean, and the bottle is portable and easy to slip into your purse, bag, suitcase, etc.... I recommend this product for everyday use, as well as for intermittent odor protection or for cleansing during menstruation. This is a natural, gentle, effective feminine wash. AAA+++",
