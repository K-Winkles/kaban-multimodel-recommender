I have to jam on the pump to get some product released, usually a tiny bit of runny soap comes out after jamming on the pump 10x, but no foam!!!!! I've bought the product a couple of times, each time hoping it would work know. Last time I screwed off the old pump and put it on the new soap bottle, but still it doesn't work :-(The product is good! I'd love to purchase it again! But it is very pricey. I wished the company would repair their pump mechanism. Or come up with another way like a soap dispenser etc.",

                "reviewText": "The foam pump never worked at all, much less work well. Of three educated adults at my house that tried, none of us ever got the bottle to dispense much of anything. I may return it for all the time it wasted. Or I may just dump the cleanser into another container - but the foam pump promise is a let down and the landfill plastic is so wasteful! Frustrating and not worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "I have been buying and using intimate wash products for about ten years. When I started, I was fortunate to find a cleanser that was created by an OB/GYN - it had no scent, it never irritated my skin, it was PH-balanced, and it was created with mild antiseptic and antifungal properties. That product was sold to a larger company at some point, I believe the formula was changed, and then it ceased to exist. Since then I have tried 4 or 5 different brands - only those that are Ph-balanced, careful to limit harmful ingredients and only those that are fragrance-free. A couple of those actually irritated my skin, and several of them had a scent. I had settled on a brand I really liked, then encountered a problem ordering it - so back to the drawing board and more searching. When I found Kushae brand, I was very hopeful. Here was a brand that was developed by an OB/GYN, contained none of the usual harmful ingredients (sulfates, parabens, DEA, alcohol, fragrances or dyes), and went even further by not including glycerine (I checked out the claim that glycerine can feed yeast and found an article on PubMed that confirmed this). I ordered and tried it, and am very pleased. This is the gentlest feeling intimate wash I have found since my favorite long ago. It has absolutely no scent. I actually like it better than my old favorite because it is produced as a foam, and I am guessing that means less need for it to lather (thereby not relying on detergent agents). Thank you for making this!",

It will not foam and just squirts fluid even after running the pump under water like instructed. I love this brand. Great for my skin but will have to switch if you don't fix the problem,. The first time I thought it was a fluke but now I can see somethings going on. I've been using this for about a year and the last couple months is when I noticed the constant new issue with the pump. Something is going on while manufacturing the product.",
