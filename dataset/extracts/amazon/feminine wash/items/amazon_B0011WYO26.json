Over the last couple months the applicator has changed several times, while I like the most recent design the product itself doesn\u2019t seem to work as well.Also, when I first started using the product there was practically no discharge. Now there is always discharge. I\u2019m unsure if the change was due to a product change or just my body adjusting to it.The product does seem to work but once the pH has gotten out of wack will take more applicators to balance than what it did previously. I\u2019ll see if now that it is balanced if I can get it to maintain with regular use again.",

                "reviewText": "Rephresh gel has been a lifesaver. I have suffered chronic UTIs for over 15 years. As a result of all the antibiotics, I have also suffered chronic yeast infections. Basically I have been rotating between antibiotics and antifungals pretty much constantly for a decade and a half! I have had 3 painful surgeries over that time to correct prolapse that was thought to be causing the infections, but after each surgery the infections came back. I happened to read on a website that vaginal ph plays a huge roll in vaginal health, and that antibiotics and antifungals can really wreck your vaginal ph and lead to infections, which lead to more antibiotics, etc.. It's a vicious cycle. After searching around on amazon I found this Rephresh gel and another similar product. I tried each one. The competing brand contained a strong artificial fragrance, which I am allergic to. The Rephresh worked like a charm! I can hardly believe it, but it has been MONTHS since I had a UTI! I use it once a week at bedtime, plus after sex. This product has had a really positive effect on my life, and helped relieve 15 years of suffering. It's a real shame my Gyn never knew to recommend this.12/15/15 update: As mentioned above, I had not gone more than a week or two without an infection in 15 years. I am happy to report that as of November 2015 I have gone over a year without a single infection!! The only thing I did differently was to use this gel once or twice a week. I almost can't believe it. No way to express the relief of being free of bladder pain and vaginal itching and burning for a whole year and counting.Update 03/30/17. The new applicator is horrible. It's wide V shape prevents me from getting the gel up far enough inside, and stretches the opening of my vagina irritating my urethra. After almost 2 years infection free I am back to chronic UTIs. I don't know if they changed the ingredients too. Whatever changes were made, PLEASE go back to the other design and product! This no longer works!",

As a person who is very prone to yeast infections and BV I really recommend this. It might not work if you are already in full-blown yeast/BV hell as it is not meant as a \"treatment\" ... Also, I am not a doctor, etc, but what I can say is: 1) I tend to get either yeast or BV after unprotected hooha, and after doing some research I realized the problem might be how seminal fluid affects vaginal pH ..... 2) this stuff is a pH balancer/corrector, and it has worked really well for me. I've put it in the day before, and also the day-ish after when starting to feel, let's say, slightly itchy, and it has fixed/stopped/prevented everything. It creates no smell, it makes pretty much no mess. It is kind of expensive but I still recommend because it really worked for me.",
