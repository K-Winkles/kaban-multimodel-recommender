I also remember purchasing and really liking the feminine wash by this brand and thought I\u2019d give the probiotic a shot. I got out of using it regularly then but about a month ago returned to daily use. All I can say is it definitely works as well as I remember. I usually like to try out different brands of supplements before I commit to one but I am certain this will be my go to moving forward.",

You do have to be consistent with them for your first bottle but after you don\u2019t have to take them daily. Always make sure that you are healthy before self diagnosing anything!! These pills, boric acid pills, and the matching soap are a must have if you want to get into health for her without going through trial and error. Remember she is supposed to have a smell that is unique to you but if you think there may be an actual problem schedule that appointment!

This feminine health supplement offers a holistic approach to maintaining a balanced and healthy intimate environment. I used another brand prior that was WAY more expensive and got the same benefits from this product!! I love that it includes the cranberry as well and that it contains probiotics and prebiotics. 10/10 recommend",

                "reviewText": "I purchased based off all the positive comments and Reviews\u2026My ph balance was off set. When I got them in mail I immediately took 2. Taking two right off hand gave me a really bad stomach ache. the next day I decided to take 1 in morning and one at night. You can take up to 2 a day anyway. Well, The first day I didn\u2019t see a difference, second day I didn\u2019t see a difference, by the 3 day evening is when I noticed a difference. I also used the VH BODY WASH\u2026I do like it very much! Women who suffer from odor, sweating or irritation this stuff is a game changer. I was using suppositories but I want something a bit more on the safer side. THIS REALLY DOES WORK AND IM GLAD THAT I PURCHASED THIS AND DID MY RESEARCH! This stuff will change someone\u2019s life. BUY YOU WONT REGRET!!",

I contacted the seller, who asked me to contact the manufacturer directly who is in US and so i am unable to do anything as i don't have the time or energy to do all this at midnight. The seller is useless and the medicine too, because no one is ready to use a medicine or supplement without knowing when it will expire. Since this medicine is very very expensive, i am unable to return it and all my money is now wasted. Worst product in this respect and no one should ever buy anything anymore from this seller who has refused to give me any constructive solution. Pathetic they are.",

I came across these whilst searching for cranberry tablets and thought it was worth a try.24 hours later, smell and discharge reduced and a week later has completely settled.It\u2019s worth a try if you get BV.
