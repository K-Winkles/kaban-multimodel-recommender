Try switching from bar soap or regular body wash to a pH\u00ad balanced feminine wash like Summer's Eve. Remember, feminine itching can be caused by a variety of factors, so always talk to your gynecologist about any itch-related matters. A pH number (0-14) measures how acidic or alkaline something is. For example pure water has a pH of 7, which is neutral. Your skin pH varies depending on the part of the body, and from person to person. Summer's Eve's pH-balanced products are specifically formulated to be in harmony with the natural pH-balance of your feminine area. Because your day is full of reasons you want to feel fresh and clean, there's Summer's Eve. Start your day with Summer's Eve cleansing washes for general daily cleansing. Then, use Summer's Eve cloths, talc-free powder and freshening spray after a workout, before getting intimate, or anytime you'd like to feel fresh and clean. For freshness overnight, try our night-time products with lavender and botanicals. Yes! Both gynecologists and dermatologists give our products the green light for everyday use. Our products are soap free, alcohol free and hypoallergenic. Love fragrance? Great! Our Safe Scents quality standards ensure that the fragrances you love are gentle enough for you most delicate skin. Plus, Summer\u2019s Eve powder is - and has always been talc free. So you can trust Summer\u2019s Eve to help you start fresh and stay fresh every day.",
