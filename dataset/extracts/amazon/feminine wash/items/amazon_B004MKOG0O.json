Our Refresh Collection is for those who love to bask in luscious fragrances. It has has an extensive range of fragrance levels, from a light, barely-there fragrance or a bold fragrance that gives you a long-lasting boost of freshness Why does pH matter? It's important to your body\u2019s natural defense and maintaining a good environment for a healthy external vaginal area. The pH of ordinary soap, can be very basic (high pH) and may not complement the natural pH range of your external vaginal area. Isn\u2019t Summer\u2019s Eve and Fem Care just if you have a problem? I don\u2019t have an issue \u201cdown there\u201d \u2026 The external vaginal area is different than other parts of your body \u2013 its delicate, and has a different pH than other areas of the body \u2013 and so it needs a different kind of care. What can I do if I experience vaginal itching? If you are experiencing vaginal itching, we recommend you talk with your doctor or healthcare professional about your symptoms. If you know that you have a yeast infection, you can find relief with one of our Monistat products.",

I need a product that will balance my PH levels and help with any odor this may cause.This Summer\u2019s Eve Cleansing Wash is very lightly scented and makes you feel clean and fresh after using it. What I like about it is you are not left smelling like a perfume factory. It leaves you feeling thoroughly \u201ccleansed\u201d with just a slight hint of peaches. This scent does dissipate quickly when you come out of the shower and dry off. The other wonderful thing about this product is it comes in several different scents depending on your preference.With these products, I have never experienced any irritation or sensitivity. You can choose to apply this with your hands, a washcloth, or a bath sponge. I have been using Summer\u2019s Eve cleansing wash for many years and have not deviated from using this product. I have also come to discover that Amazon has the best prices for a 3-pack of the cleansing wash.I highly recommend this wash as it is PH balanced, does a fantastic job of controlling odor, and leaves you feeling clean and fresh.I did purchase this with my own money and these are my thoughts and opinions solely.PROS*Cleanses away odor causing bacteria*No skin irritation*Comes in a variety of scents*Gentle to use everyday*Great price for a 3-packCONS*none",
