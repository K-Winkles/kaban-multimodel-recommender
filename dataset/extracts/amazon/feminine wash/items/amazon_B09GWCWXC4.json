                "reviewText": "Ladies. Let's get very personal here. TMI, if you will. Do you have recurring BV? Bacterial Vaginosis?(I am going to repeat these terms a lot in case someone wanting to buy this needs to search those in order to find a review that talks about it)For the past 3-5 years, I have had recurring BV. It showed up out of nowhere. I've seen my doctor over and over. Im medically clean but apparently my PH is so off balance that I have recurring Bacterial Vaginosis. I have tried Boric Acid suppositories, gentle feminine washes, prebiotics, probiotics, teas for gut health, supplements for gut health, I have even tried the prescribed medicine my doctor has given me. Those antibiotics only kept my BV at bay for one month. One. Month. It got to the point where I was wearing panty liners 24/7 because the discharge was constant and THE SMELL ... Honey ... Horrible. Whenever I needed to go out among people, I was wearing a tampon to soak up the discharge so I'd stay fresh.Then I found this.A feminine wash with boric acid in it.Those boric acid suppositories work but only for 2-3 days max. That's how persistent my Bacterial Vaginosis is. But this?!?!?I have only been using 2-3 weeks and it has been a game changer. I shower every day and wash my lady parts with this wash.No smell.No (or very little) discharge.No irritation from the wash.Im over the moon.If I go 1-2 days without using this wash, my BV symptoms are still less but they do begin to creep back in ... But if you are persistent with the wash and your BV is recurring like mine, this will help IMMENSELY.You may be a little dry but it isn't unbearable or irritating (for me).Im so happy I decided to try this wash and do encourage others to try it as long as your lady parts are not super sensitive. Boric Acid can be a source of irritation for some so please know your limits.This is not something you insert into your vagina so please dont do it! This is an external wash only!But I recommend it ... 1000/10.",

I've used other feminine washes that carried me through an 8 he day even lasting through the hot summer days. But this was almost non existent. I felt fresh rite after using it but within a few hrs not so much. I wouldn't purchase this wash again as I saw no benefits different than others or better.",

My girl is quite SENSITIVE and I can't use just anything, but I've not been disappointed by any product from this brand! Does exactly what it claims.",
