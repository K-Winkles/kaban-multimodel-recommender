I don\u2019t know if I got a bad batch but you have to see when you get yours if the smell is just not there where it should smell like sweet pineapple. I am glad I tried it but won\u2019t buy it due to know pineapple smell, maybe there will improve that!",

                "reviewText": "I use Yoni Oils for a nice feminine touch\u2014sometimes via a couple drops on a panty liner, others via direct application on the skin--and looked forward to using this product. Unfortunately, the Pineapple scent is barely there; I almost had to put my nose IN the bottle just to smell the fragrance. On the other hand, I don\u2019t want any strong smells (neither good or bad) to emanate from my nether regions, nor would I want to put a heavily scented oil in that area. Still, a similar rose oil I\u2019ve tried before didn\u2019t have that issue so I know this product can be improved. This Yoni oil moisturized well without any irritation; however, due to the ghost scent, I rated it 3 stars.",
