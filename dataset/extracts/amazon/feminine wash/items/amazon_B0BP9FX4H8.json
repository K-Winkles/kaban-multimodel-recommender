I was suffering frequent yeast infections as a result of my skin\u2019s microbiota (the normal bacteria & yeast that are always there) being completely out of whack because it was so dry all the time.Gave this a go- holy crap! It only takes a tiny bit (a pea-size or less) and stays on all day; there\u2019s even still the slightest bit after swimming. After a few days of use, my skin was much less inflamed, and after a week, back to normal. I can even skip a day or two now without discomfort (though I try not to!).",
