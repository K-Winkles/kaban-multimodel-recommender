                "reviewText": "I really liked this product when it was new. It has very pleasant smell, was non-irritating and pumped up fluffy, as described. However, after a few months, product no longer came out of container except it dripped down as a liquid on the product's sides. Only if you can finish this product within 2 months would it deserve 4 stars. Otherwise. I'd give it 1 star for lack of longevity.",
