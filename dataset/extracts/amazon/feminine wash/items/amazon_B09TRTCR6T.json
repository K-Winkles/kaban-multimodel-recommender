                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The product is very nice to use, after using the toilet for bladder or bowel movement and I especially use it in the shower. I learned of a product like this a couple of years back on a private site, a little more expensive, yet worth it, but my coins are working for me differently these days so I came to old faithful \ud83d\ude09. As I had always done stinja (an Arabic toilet cleansing process after relieving yourself to insure cleanliness down below, front and back) as a woman I wanted to enhance the clean. I just wish I had paid attention as to it being ultra sensitive, because I prefer just sensitive and a cooling sensation, I will be sure to look for that on my next purchase. Oh and a little goes a long way.",
