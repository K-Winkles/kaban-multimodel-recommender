Ladies, this wash is absolute MAGIC for helping ease any smell, frequent discharge, and unwanted wetness,etc. I have been using an older sweet spot's lab product for many years now, and this new one completely surpassed the older formula! I am a very clean gal, even have bidets in every bathroom, But no matter what almost everyday it would be uncomfortable and smelly down there even after showering 30 minutes before. I have constantly been trying to find something that could help ease all of that and this did that even after one application. I feel so much more comfortable now that I'm not constantly worried about smell or underwear getting uncomfortable as the day goes on. Every time I use it, I feel so clean and comfortable. I had pretty low expectations for this, but it genuinely has saved me from being so uncomfortable everyday! This is my new favorite shower product!I can't wait to try some of their new products when I get the chance! I'd recommend this to anyone! It's also unscented so you don't have to worry about it smelling bad or irritating your special spot \ud83d\udc9cDon't think, just buy it! You won't regret it \ud83e\ude75",

While I\u2019ve noticed an improvement in my overall freshness and comfort, I wish the bottle were a bit larger for the price.

Used this SweetSpot feminine wash for the first time today and it completely eliminated the odor and even after couple of hours, the odor has not returned. It is truly unscented. Soft and moisturizing. Finger nail size amount goes a long, long way. Will see how long the effectiveness lasts. At this point, I am very happy with this product and I will buy it again. I hope Amazon continues to sell it. 5 stars.",
