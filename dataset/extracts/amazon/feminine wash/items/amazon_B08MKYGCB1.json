It\u2019s also been very hot lately since it was summer So it\u2019s easy for me to sweat between my legs very often and as we all know bacteria love wet and damp places so unfortunately it\u2019s easy for me to have the same musty smell you would usually get under your armpits. I would use all kinds of soaps, I would shower 2-3 times a day ( I even contemplated using deodorant down there but I heard it\u2019s bad for u but I was so desperate I was willing to try ANYTHING) and when I would go to put clothes on, it\u2019s almost as if the smell lingered and I never showered in the first place . This would obviously upset me so much as I am such a clean person and always try to take care of myself in all aspects. This wasn\u2019t a smell that would come from the inside of my \u2026 for lack of a better term, hoohaa. Just an FYI I was cleared from any infections as I went to the doctors and had no STD\u2019s, yeast infections, BV, Vaginitis etc, I know those cause smells but I didn\u2019t have anything. But rather it was coming from the space between my inner thigh and outer labia. AGAIN sorry for TMI. But how embarrassing would it be to have a future partner go down there and smell that when yk you\u2019ve showered right before????In my desperation, I looked up hacks for better hygienic methods to take care of the issue and came across \u201cYONI\u201d bar. I\u2019ve never heard about a ph balance soap till this week and after reading some reviews, I figured I\u2019d say f it. Soon as it came in I showered w it and the smell was GONE. I definitely sweat in my sleep and go to the bathroom when I wake up and again, SAME smell. It\u2019s not awful but having a slightly musty smell isn\u2019t the best feeling when you know you\u2019ve showered prior to taking a nap. I slept 8 hrs, and I am so so so pleased/relieved that the mustiness that once bothered me is now gone. I will update when I go to the gym, and in a couple days as well. But so far I am ECSTATIC \ud83e\udd79",

I noticed tenderness afterwards then a day later irritated skin that created an unusual discharge. I thought I may have developed a yeast infection after googling my symptoms but the test was negative and the irritation remains. I have an appointment with my doctor to hopefully get some relief but it has been very unpleasant and I seriously regret using this product.",

                "reviewText": "No one warned me what a big issue smell would be down. I've been up and down products to control my smell down there. I've been so embarrassed that I avoid using the bathrooms at work in fear of offending. No matter how many times I was with \"ph\" soap, i'm just immediately smelly after cleaning.This has been a life saver. It's been two days and yes there's still usual intimate smell but its not rank od fushussy at all. Its normalussy smell. Thank you so much, this product has likely saved years off my kidneys. I can finally go to public bathrooms instead of holding it in.its a bit pricey for 2 small bars of soap BUT its not pricey at all compared to other yoni bars on this site. actually quite a steal for someone like me whose been at wits end trying to find something that works for the fishussy smell.I will be buying more in other scents to see which I like better. Peach smells like real peach with some chemical to it, but I'd rather that than fishussy.",
