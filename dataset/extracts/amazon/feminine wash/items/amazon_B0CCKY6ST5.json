I use this full body because it promises to help prevent yeast as well and especially under breast I have issues. We had a couple of hot days and I got a rash under the breast. It was about healed but was itchy and cracking again. I used this soap twice and it healed up !! It wasn\u2019t my main reason for purchase but it sure is a bonus that it healed that area! Other soaps were not gentle enough and made things worse.For the first time ever at age 37 I had gotten a yeast infection and ever since I\u2019ve had pain and dryness in my neither regions. Painful painful just dry and itchy. I\u2019ve washed now with this soap only for a week now and it has soothed so much.I was at the point I was raw and would actually be burning but this has really helped soothe the area. It smells wonderful and I think my skin being sensitive is what has not allowed me to do well with other soaps. This is going to be my go to from now on because it works well all over !!",
