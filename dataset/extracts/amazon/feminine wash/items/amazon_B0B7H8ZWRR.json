                "reviewText": "This has become my favorite soap to use in the shower! It lathers amazingly, smells fabulous, and really does help reduce odor, especially when combined with the oil. The oil on its own also works great! Going through peri menopause is like going through puberty all over again, including unbecoming odors! I won\u2019t go without these products moving forward!",
