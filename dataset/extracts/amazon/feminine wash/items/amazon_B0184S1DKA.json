PH Balanced, Naturally Inspired, & Gynecologist Tested (Pack of 4 Bottles, 4.5oz Each Bottle) - Summer\u2019s Eve Douche will leave you feeling clean and fresh. The mild, yet effective, the pH-balanced formula has been gynecologist tested for gentleness to make sure you\u2019re getting the proper attention you so rightly deserve without irritation. Directions: Remove sanitary overwrap. Hold the bottle cap with one hand and firmly grasp the Comfortip nozzle with the other hand. Pull the nozzle straight up until it clicks in place. Douche is not ready for use until you hear this click. Gently insert the nozzle into your vagina, no more than 3 inches, and slowly squeeze the bottle. Do not close the vaginal opening; douching solution should flow freely out of the vagina. Use while sitting on the toilet, in the tub, or in the shower.",
