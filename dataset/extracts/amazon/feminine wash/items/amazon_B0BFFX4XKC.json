                "reviewText": "After reading a lot of the reviews, I bought this recently for travel. I determined it was cheaper than buying all plastic bottles and filling them with the products I needed. I was pleasantly surprised when I got the product. The pouch is sturdy and black. There are a few products I didn\u2019t need but I pulled them out and was able to put in some additional products and they all fit perfectly. The shampoo, conditioner, body wash with the little loofah lasted long enough for my trip as did the lotions, shaver and shaving cream. It was nice they included a little packet of cotton face wipes along with cotton swabs. I could\u2019ve done without the cotton balls which were few and extremely small. A suggestion would be a mini pack of unscented, sensitive hand wipes and a shower cap, But I just bought those at the store before I left and it did indeed fit into the pouch. I do have to go with other reviews that the toothbrush is pretty cheap and the bristles did fall out. Luckily I was able to get an extra toothbrush from the hotel but next time I\u2019ll carry my own toothbrush in small toothbrush plastic container which I believe will fit in the bag itself. It is roomier than I thought and it is sturdy. Had no problems with packing it snuggly and the zipper was fine. The great thing besides it being TSA regulated and fitted just fine in my suitcase, is that when I got home I just refilled everything, put it back in the pouch and it\u2019s ready for the next trip. To me, it was really worth the money and I was happy with the purchase.",

There are even items that my husband can use, so this kit is like getting two for the price of one! It has reusable items, like a comb, nylon puff, toothbrush and more, so all I have to do is replace a few items that are disposable for my next trip. And I love the purple bag that's included (happens to be my favorite color)! It's nice quality with a very good quality zipper and is big enough to hold my other travel items.",

                "reviewText": "This bag had everything I needed for my long wkd trip. I was very nervous bc I hadn't flown in almost 20yrs & hadn't had to do all the new tsa stuff. So this made it much, much easier & eased my anxiety. Everything fit perfect & once I took the cardboard out I could add a few more items. The cons I would say are very minor. The Toothbrush was falling apart & came with the bristles bent to the side. So that I had to throw away. Also, for me, the comb wasn't necessary. I would have rather they skipped those 2 & put in something else that could be used like a hand sanitizer or mini poof. Otherwise it was exactly what I needed & was much easier than buying empty bottles & filling them up. Again the only con truly was the useless beat up toothbrush",

                "reviewText": "I needed a TSA-approved clear bag in addition to appropriately sized toiletries. This product satisfied those requirements.This was priced very well, but the only downside was that it did not come with body wash. I had to pour out the conditioner bottle, rinse it, and then fill it with my own body wash. If this came with body wash, it would be ideal.But otherwise, it\u2019s still a good choice and it gives you peace of mind in knowing that the toiletries and the clear bag conform to TSA\u2019s standards.The clear bag is also very useful for storing your own personal toiletries after your flight home, not just toiletries for travel. I continue to use the bag to keep all my toiletries in one place.",
