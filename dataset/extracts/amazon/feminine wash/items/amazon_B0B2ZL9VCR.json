Perfect for those who are irritated by fragrance and perfumes but this is a bit expensive for the bottle size compared to body wash for me it is worth it as It wont be used on entire body but it could be. It does state it has probiotics in it not sure that wash on wash off probiotics work like the oral ones. The bigger bottle is cost wise better than the smaller ones for the same amount of ounces.",
