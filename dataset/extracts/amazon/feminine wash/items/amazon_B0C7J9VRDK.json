If you\u2019re dry and tight putting that tube up is a really difficult task, not impossible but very unpleasant. The shape is so not made to go up there. \ud83d\ude44Besides my complaints about the applicators, this product is great. Really moisturizing, smells so fresh (no fragrance) and makes you feel \u201chealthy\u201d down there. For me it still burns a little bit when I apply it after certain activities *wink* because there are tiny tears that form and I think the boric acid is what makes it burn a bit. It\u2019s just a tiny bit tho, it\u2019s alright.Also today I discovered I can use it as lube!! Just a bit goes along way and it doesn\u2019t dry and pill like other lubes do!Just ordered two more to have in stock",
