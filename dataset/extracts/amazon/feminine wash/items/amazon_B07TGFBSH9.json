The ingredients in Healthy V Vitamin help to manage a healthy Candida yeast balance throughout the body at the cellular level.* My Healthy V Vitamins arrived, and the tablets look slightly different in color than usual - is this normal? Yes! Slight changes in pigment are totally normal and expected. Since we use ingredients that are seasonally sourced, depending on the time, weather, and environment, there can be a slight change in the color and texture from batch to batch. How quickly does Healthy V Vitamin work? How quickly Healthy V Vitamin works depends on everyone's unique body, health, genetics, diet, etc., therefore everyone will respond slightly differently to Healthy V Vitamin. It can take anywhere from 2-6 weeks before you see lasting results.* Is Healthy V Vitamin safe to take if I have nut allergies? Healthy V Vitamin contains coconut oil powder & some people with nut allergies may react to this ingredient. Please review the full ingredient list & consult your doctor to make sure it is right before you before adding to your regimen. Why do the tablets have a strong smell? We don't use chemicals to mask or cover up any tastes or smells that naturally come from our formulas, so Healthy V Vitamin can be a bit more potent due to the turmeric in the formula.",
