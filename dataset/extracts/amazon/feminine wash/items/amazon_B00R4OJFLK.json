A lot of companies don't realize that scented products aren't the best idea in that area, so I'm happy to see a smaller company with an unscented wash as an option.First off, this cleanses wonderfully. It lathers well, and unless you're using it all over your body, a single bottle lasts quite a while. Every body is different, but I find this to be completely non-irritating, which hasn't been the case with other similar products I've tried. It's great for the more sensitive areas of your body, and it's even gentle enough to use as a face wash; even though I have dry skin, I don't find this to be stripping at all.It is truly unscented. No hidden essential oils, no scent from the compounds making up the product. It's an excellent product for sensitive skin. I've used it for probably 4-5 years and will always repurchase it. If Sliquid ever stops selling this body wash, I will make a one-woman protest until they start producing it again. It's just that good, consistently.",

This is an excellent product; very gentle and mild, and a little truly goes a long way, so the bottle should last a very long time.I found out that this also makes a great body wash, as I had run out of my regular product, and tried this instead. I have had a mild, non-itchy rash on my upper arm for at least a year now, and nothing has helped to clear it. I have tried different soaps and lotions, as well as dietary changes to no avail. After about seven days of washing with this,the rash is about 75% GONE. I am shocked! So, I guess I have found a new body wash. I love that it is truly non-scented, also. I highly recommend this product and would encourage anyone to try out thier other products.As a side note, the bottle I received was different than the one shown in the picture. Well sealed, and shipped great.",

Then I began having trouble with dryness and irritation so went looking for a feminine wash. I chose this due to the good reviews, natural ingredients, and fragrance free option as I am allergic to many fragrances.Love this stuff. Very gentle and no more irritation. I also noticed that it said it could be used as body wash, bubble bath, etc. And since I loved it as a feminine wash I began using it as shampoo, face wash, and body wash just to see.My hair is softer and has more body (I was previously using natural shampoo bars which I loved, but this works a little better even!)My acne has improved greatly with healthy eating and using natural skincare products, but since using this as a face wash I have noticed a slight improvement and had almost no acne this month during the time I usually break out. It removes makeup well but is gentle enough not to dry my skin or cause my eyes to sting.Definitely a fan of this stuff. It's cheaper than the fancy organic face washes I was using, but a little more expensive than the bar soap and shampoo bar I had been using. However, it is worth it to me due to the improvement in my skin and hair as well as the convenience. Rather than having shampoo, conditioner, face wash, body wash, and feminine wash...I now just have a bottle of this and a bottle of hair conditioner in my shower. Also much more convenient to pack an all in one product for travel.",

It is pricey but a little goes a long way it will last a year if you use small amounts, definitely worth the price.",
