                "reviewText": "I suffer from chronic yeast infections and BV that leave me constantly uncomfortable and worried about odor issues. I desperately sought professional help so many times over the years (even when traveling abroad - it was that bad!) that I began to joke, \u201cDoctors/nurses have seen my lady bits and had fingers up in there more times than lovers have!\u201dI did everything I knew to do lifestyle-wise to manage. Cotton underwear, no soap or douches, fragrance-free laundry detergent, probiotics, etc. No help. I relied on prescription Diflucan, anti-itch cream, and expensive OTC Monistat treatments that only helped one occurrence at a time. Odor remained a big problem.I was so embarrassed and hesitant in the bedroom that I would try to distract my partner by insisting on satisfying him first and making him sleepy so that I wouldn\u2019t have to undress.I finally realized that I wasn\u2019t \u201cfailing\u201d at following professional advice. I was following it, but it wasn\u2019t enough, and it wasn\u2019t my fault. So, I browsed around for alternative treatments I may not have known about to tackle the problem from all angles. I ordered Dove fragrance-free white bar soap with moisturizing lotion built in so that I could gently clean the area without causing irritation; Balance Complex oral supplements to help any internal issues; boric acid suppository capsules to regulate pH; and this oil blend for odor control.I wasn\u2019t sure if any of it would help, but I hit the jackpot! Two months into this treatment system, I got maybe two mild cases of BV. Boric acid suppositories knocked them right out. And......to the main point of this review, this oil blend did WONDERS. It smells SO good, and not in that artificial, perfumy Febreeze way. It is a natural, somewhat herbal-smelling combination of essential oils that (super weird observation) complements my natural scent when I\u2019m infection-free. Another weird observation: it smells very similar to standard Poo-Pourri. That may be an unpleasant parallel to make, but hey, they both incorporate essential oils and excel at trapping odors!It\u2019s also a fantastic mousturizer! In combination with the Dove moisturizing soap, my painful cracked/irritated/torn/raw/scarred skin from years of infections is fully healed! FULLY! I feel unapologetically sexy and beautiful and my confidence has skyrocketed!How I use it:- As a moisturizer after showers and shaving (really working it into the skin instead of just spraying and letting it sit)- Spray a little in my undies for confidence through the day- Spray some more on them just before working out at the gym for peace of mind- Whenever I feel skin irritation or smell anything funky (which is a much rarer ordeal these days)- Spray generously on pads to help control \u201cperiod smell\u201dIf you\u2019re like me, GET THIS. You\u2019re welcome.",

                "reviewText": "Ok so I wanted to give myself some time using this product to give an honest review. Due to fibroids I had to have surgery. I'm in my mid 40's so my hormones and ph balance was literally thrown out of whack. I ordered this product in between doctors appointments with my family doctor and obgyn because I couldn't tell if I had symptoms of a UTI, bladder infection or yeast infection. All I know is I was very irritated and frustrated and it kept happening frequently. I was trying everything I could, diflucan, over the counter creams, azo.....you name it. The doctor told me that I could have a condition called some weird name I forgot that can mimic these symptoms. They did labs everything came back normal and I was also sent for and ultra sound of my bladder no treatment given while waiting for these results. Meanwhile this product had arrived very quickly. I was skeptical in ordering it because it's not cheap. Welp to my surprise it's been well over a month and I feel WONDERFUL. It's hard not to be graphic due to the nature of this products purpose so excuse me, but I feel fresh and smell fresh all day. I feel moisturized all day, my symptoms are gone and have not returned. My sex life has even improved. Now to be clear I do not use this as a sexual lubrication! I just feel it has restored my body's natural chemistry for things to work like normal again. Also contrary to the reviews about how it sprays I have no issue. I promise you a little goes a long way. As I said I've been using this product for over a month daily and the bottle is still basically full. After I'm showered and towel dried I spray a full stream in the palm of my clean lotion free hand, from there I use my other clean lotion free hand to distribute it around my front lady parts and then in the back. A little over a week into using this my doctors office called to do a follow up for my symtoms stating that my labs are good and I should also follow up again with my obgyn and probably see a urologist....PSSSHHH....I WAS ALREADY BETTER!!!!! I no longer use any other feminine deodorant sprays and I only wash my lady parts with a natural feminine wash coupled with this. I saved myself over $200 in doctor follow up co pays, prescriptions and other over the counter remedies because this little bottle solved my problem. I will definitely buy this again!",

I recently ordered a bottle to try as my regular feminine product was becoming boring, needless to say I will be ordering more of this feminine spray.The spray smells so good, it's kind, soft and gentle on your skin and lasts all day long. You don't need to use much either. I have found I feel more confident in myself. Like me if you are a woman of a certain age, this works to take away the body odour we unfortunately acquire!All I can say is try it for yourself \ud83e\udd17",
