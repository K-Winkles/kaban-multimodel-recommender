The presecription pills raised my liver funtion levels. The fungus went away but then came back. My Doc also prescribed toenail polish to be applied twice per day. Seriously, what guy has time to paint his toenails twice a day?None of the products worked. After using The FungaSoap for about two weeks (twice per day) the hard scales sloughed off and my nails looked much better. I was embarressed to wear sandles without socks before I started using this product. I continue to use the product and am very happy I found something that works.",
