                "reviewText": "I was skeptical to use these because I didn\u2019t necessarily believe the hype that a bar soap could help with odor \u201cdown there\u201d. My experience with bar soap is that it\u2019s too drying and I wind up with itchy, dry skin, something I don\u2019t want to deal with on my sensitive lady parts.This soap is made with nourishing oils like coconut, strawberry, and olive, and also contains shea butter.It also contains lauric acid, an ingredient that\u2019s good for its antibacterial benefits.The included mesh bag makes it easy to get this soap into a fantastic lather. It rinses off easily and my skin has that squeaky-clean feeling afterwards. I worried about that when I first used it because that often means dry skin will soon follow. So far, so good though. I\u2019ve not had any itching or irritation and so far it\u2019s been doing an amazing job of combating odor. I\u2019m actually quite impressed with how fresh I feel all day.The scent is yummy but doesn\u2019t last so you don\u2019t have to worry about smelling like a strawberry patch all day. It\u2019s a nice scent to float around me when I\u2019m showering.I will definitely be getting these bars again!!",

                "reviewText": "The soap itself is great, but the smell...is beyond pungent. Just removing the bar from the wrapper filled my entire bathroom with a strong smell of either strawberry daiquiri or a strawberry milkshake starting to turn. I'm assuming that's the lactic acid in it, but it is a powerful scent. I still wanted to give this soap a shot and only used a small bit of the lather to clean myself to make sure it didn't leave me smelling heavily of whatever that \"extra\" smell was on top of the strawberries. If it were more strawberry-scented instead, I'd probably rate this higher. As far as the soap itself goes, it lathers well and seems fairly gentle, but we will have to see if it keeps my pH balanced like it's supposed to or if it throws it off.",

The fragrance is not overpowering, yet is light and feminine. The whole point of yoni soaps is to keep your pH balanced and your lady parts smelling fresh and natural, rather than funky and unwelcoming. This soap does it's job. After using it, and throughout the day I felt clean and fresh. Like I said, the scent wasn't overpowering, no one wants to give off the aroma of a fruit salad either. Because let's face it, then people start to wonder what you're hiding with all that perfume. 10/10, will buy again, and would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "It came in minimal packaging, 2 beautiful soaps nicely packed in a fitted white padded envelope, thumbs up for that. In each of the soap box, comes with a bag that you can place the soap in, theoretically it will generate more bubble when the soap is placed inside.We follow the instructions, put the soap in the bag and rub in the hands to generate foams, place it on the private part, and wait for 3 minutes, the light scent of strawberries is delicious and yummy, the 3 layers itself is mesmerizing, overall the experience to use the soap is soothing and comforting.",

If you\u2019re into soap sculpture, the tricolor effect would be interesting in a soap sculpture.It\u2019s great that it\u2019s vegan, but it\u2019s also overpriced for even two bars of soap.",
