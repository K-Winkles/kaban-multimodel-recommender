            "MAINTAINS BALANCE: When it comes to maintaining vaginal health, it's important to look for a cleanser with ingredients that help soothe itching, calm irritation, and help balance vaginal pH levels.

TBD.I also sort of like the weird medicinal scent. It kind of smells like an intense olive oil mixed with an intense tea tree oil and unknown herbs and spices. Honestly, I imagine some guy in a dark Amazon forest mixing this together in a bowl and chanting away the end of all yeast infections before bottling it in a bright pink and orange plastic bottle.Using something scented down there worries me a bit. My moto\u2019s more like \u201cPrada on the wrist. Organic in the slit.\u201d \u2728On a more serious note, I do wish the bottle was a little less glaringly bright so I could leave it in my shower. I\u2019d rather not call direct attention to my personal business.",

The size of the tube is misleading for how much is in it; but a little goes (pea size) long way. So the amt in the tube will last.",

It has a strong smell and it burns when you use it but it said that was normal but let me tell you it worked! All symptoms went away and i finally feel normal down there again lol!!",
