After I finished that bottle I tried a few other ones from different brands and this one is by far my favorite. At first I was expecting the white bottle and not going to lie I thought they sent me the wrong product. But I looked up the store and they have changed their name to AllMatters. The bottle is small but you only need a pea size amount, it lathers up nicely. It gets rid of any smells, I have used it after shaving and it does not irritate or burn my skin even if I get a little razor cut. It also has lactic acid which helps to brighten up the skin and I can see my inner thighs lighter just from using this but like I said I have been using this for a while and will continue to. Overall I love the packaging, the simple ingredients, it\u2019s fragrance free but makes me feel super clean!",

I have extreme sensitivity in my intimate area and cannot use body wash or even feminine washes because they irritate me and throw off my pH balance. I decided to try out a menstrual cup because I hate pads and tampons aren\u2019t so great either, so I purchased this product to cleanse my menstrual cup and also tried it as a feminine wash. I really like it and purchased more. The first time I tried it I noticed an irritation, an almost \u201cburning\u201d sensation, but I thought that may have been due to my pH trying to balance itself after using a regular body wash before trying this product. I gave it another chance and no issues since! Plus it\u2019s the best wash I\u2019ve ever used on my intimate area. It\u2019s thick and a little goes a long way. I had to get more. I cannot smell any scent but plastic from the packaging.",

For clarity, I think it would be helpful for the company to re-list the product or change the pictures to reflect the new branding. I specifically buy from this company bc they use safe and clean ingredients that are gentle on v area.",

Make sure to squirt a dime-sized amount or else you accidentally wash off more soap than you needed.The only nitpick is the difficulty of removing the cap off. You got to have a good grip from your thumb and push open with some force. But closing the cap is much easy!",

It has a mild smell and its soft on my skin and I didn't have to use a lot of the product to make it work. I use a drop or 2 to wash my privates and to clean my cup. I just got another one and I think I'm gonna stick to this product as long as it keeps working the way it has been working. Is not super tick so I gave it 3 stars, which is like a 3 for thickness not in \"value\".It made my ph level stay in control, which is one of the concerns I had at the beginning.",
