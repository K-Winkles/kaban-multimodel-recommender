I discovered yoni oil, and it is a game changer. I apply a little to the exterior areas and it just refreshes the skin, especially after shaving. The oil is light enough to not feel greasy or make me uncomfortable as it absorbs quickly. I like the natural aroma these oils offer and although the scent is mild it makes me feel like Im so fresh like a little flower. Its soothing after any discomfort, for example I am a cyclist and find sometimes I am sore and this just makes me feel better. Recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I received this 3 Pack Yoni Essential Oil for Women from Wovarkie as part of a promotion. Here is what I think:1. They came in a padded packet and each bottle was in its own box and each bottle was wrapped in bubble wrap, so the manufacturer was very careful to make sure this item does not get damaged.2. When I opened the outer package, I could smell these without having to even open the boxes.3. The scents were absolutely lovely. I made my husband sniff the bottles, and he did not care for them, but I thought they were great.4. I started with some on the back of my hand to see how strong the scent was going to be. It was not overpowering and seemed to last quite a while.5. Next step was to try it on a panty liner. That worked really, really well.6. Next was to try it on the outer area of my you know what. The oil did not irritate me or cause any problems.7. As for hydration, I can\u2019t really say that I noticed any difference in that area after using it several times.8. The packaging clearly stated that this was for external use only, so I did not go internally with this product.Overall, the smell is great. My preferred method is probably going to be a combination of on the skin and on the liner. That way you get the benefit of both. I just cannot get over the smell. I am literally sitting here still sniffing the bottles in between typing.",

These oils are 100% organic and hypoallergenic. I received 3-3.00 Fl Oz bottles of Mango, Strawberry and Pineapple scented oils. The strawberry scent is strongest of the 3, but they all smell nice. I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like and feel after using these oils. I feel fresh, odor free and more confident. The product page explains the health benefits of using these oils so make sure you read it all. There are 3 ways to use these feminine oils, 1. Put it on your intimate area. 2. Use it directly on the pantyliner. 3. Dilute 1 to 2 drops with warm water to your bath. I have found the best way for me is to put a few drops on my pantyliner, the scent last and I have not had any irritation. I can't say if all the benefits they list work, because I haven't used the product that long. I sure hope they do and I will continue to use this product.",

The directions also state that a few drops can be added directly to the bathtub, so I tried that and my bath smelled amazing!All in all this is not a bad product by any means but I do wish the scent lasted longer.",

A few we can recognize are: sweet almond oil, tea tree oil, rose oil, geranium oil, mint oil, camellia oil, mugwort oil, magnolia oil, clove oil, sea buckthorn oil, angelica oil and more. These bottles are very colorful and the smells are very sweat and strong. There are three recommend way of usage, it is probably easier to apply them on panty liners.",

                "reviewText": "I'm already familiar with Yoni's Essential Oil for Women in their orange scent and I absolutely love it. I ordered this 3-pack so I could also try out their strawberry, mango, and pineapple scents. They are all very pleasant-smelling, easy to apply, and don't irritate your sensitive skin areas. The strawberry is now my favorite, but they are all very nice and give a nice subtle fruity scent that lasts for a few hours. I highly recommend giving Yoni a try!",
