Its never left my skin super moist but it does not leave it dry either. I've never found a body wash that truly moisturizes my skin. Just put lotion on after you shower. That's what everyone else is doing anyways, lol. Or take a bath with vitamin E oil in it. I live in Tucson, AZ . and I can vouch that it works. This bottle wash comes in a huge body, so you get your moneys worth. Just a small amount will make you smell great but not like perfume. Its smells clean, natural, herbal, and light. The lemongrass is wonderful, the tea tree oil smells clean and is also an antibacterial. The body wash also includes clary sage. the combination of all three not only kills all bacteria on your body, but leaves you smelling naturally clean but not overpowering. Its my favority from now on.",
