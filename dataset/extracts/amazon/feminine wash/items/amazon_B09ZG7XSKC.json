I had to use steroid liquid for a week and then repeat it to help some. I was really bummed about not being able to use my natural Aveda products for my curly, thick and frizzy tendancy hair. I was pleasantly surprised that this product did the same thing MUCH more affordably without the scent. I am impressed and will be a regular customer. My scalp and skin is super sensitive so I don't actually put any onto my scalp...but carefully apply just about 1/2 inch to an inch above my scalf and throughout the rest of my hair. I also combine this with unscented shampoo & conditioner and the Vanicare gel for separating hair and reducing frizz. I really like this company and am new to their products.",
