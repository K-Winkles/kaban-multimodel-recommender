Also I bought the cheapest pack and it came with two of the bars and 1 oil but the mesh bag makes it so smooth",

                "reviewText": "I gave this review a 4/5 because the liquid soap lid wasn\u2019t closed all the way in the packaging so some did leak out but it wasn\u2019t a terrible amount and while the liquid soap and bar soap smell just like peaches, the oil didn\u2019t even after I shook it up to distribute the smell evenly. The oil smells more like cooking oil more than peaches. Other than that, I love using the lather bag and smelling fresh and clean!",
