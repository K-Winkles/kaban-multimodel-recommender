It helps maintain moisture in intimate areas much better than other brands I\u2019ve tried. The cost is a little higher than similar products I\u2019ve tried, but it only takes a small amount of Organyc compared to twice as much as other brands.Organyc used to be on Subscribe and Save, but soon after I set it up, the product became unavailable via this ordering method. I purchased 6 bottles just a few weeks ago because stock was almost gone, and I fear it might be getting ready to be discontinued. I hope not! Please Organyc, don\u2019t discontinue this wonderful product!",
