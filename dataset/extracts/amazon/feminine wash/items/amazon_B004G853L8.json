Scrolling through and saw this and checked it out. Good ingredients and decent reviews, I decided to try it. I am extremely pleased with its performance. Great scent and not overpowering. The body wash leaves me feeling perfectly hydrated and I don\u2019t get that oily feeling on my skin a few hours after bathing. I would definitely recommend it!!",

I even use it to wash my face and find that it is non-drying. My family and I all use this stuff whenever one of our cats rubs itchies (from prowling outside in the tumbleweeds or nettles) all over our face; I believe this is evidence of its detoxifying effect.Oh, and I absolutely agree with someone else's comment about the marketing changes. The older bottle look was FAR more appealing. In fact, it was one of my favorite marketing designs for all products, one I've even taken clues from for my own marketing. The new design is blah.",

                "reviewText": "After using this for a couple months, I have a few specific comments but I haven\u2019t noticed anything particularly groundbreaking or noteworthy about the product itself. I do however like the ethics of the brand as a whole (vegan, cruelty free, sustainability, transparency) as far as what I can tell from their marketing and a brief google search. I did do a lot of research into the ingredients and I found that they are a lot better than most other body soaps. A lot of other skincare products claim to be \u201cun scented\u201d or \u201cfragrance free\u201d while still having a bunch of other irritating perfuming ingredients like high concentrations of essential oils etc. Since this product is unscented, the smell is kind of a weird earthy/oceany smell that I\u2019m assuming is because of the seaweed. I didn\u2019t like the smell at first, but it\u2019s not very strong and as far as I can tell it doesn\u2019t linger on the skin. My family didn\u2019t notice any weird smell after I started using it at least. It\u2019s possible that this also means it\u2019s not as deeply cleansing as I feel like recently I\u2019ve started to get smelly slightly quicker than I used to, but it\u2019s also getting very hot where I live which may be the only culprit for that.I have a problem with dry legs especially when shaving and it\u2019s gotten a lot better ever since I started using a new set of products. I can\u2019t give all the credit to this as I\u2019ve also been using different lotion and shave cream, but I do think that it\u2019s a helpful factor as a body soap that\u2019s not harsh and doesn\u2019t strip the skin.I don\u2019t have particularly sensitive skin so I can\u2019t speak much to that, but I haven\u2019t gotten any irritation using this.",

Perhaps it is the combinations used.Seaweed is known to have many hydrating and detoxifying benefits for skin. That is why I purchased this cleanser. It did clean well and left my skin feeling soft, not dried out.I was not allergic to any of the essential oils used to scent the product.Also, two bottles leaked slightly. Just enough to be annoying, but not enough to spur me to ship it back.The company needs to put an inner seal on the bottle under the cap.Amazon had wrapped the product very well, but jostling during shipping likely loosened the manufacturer's cap.I will buy the unscented next time.",

                "reviewText": "I have incredibly sensitive and dry skin, despite that I still like my products to smell nice. I've wanted to try a seaweed product, plus this was a really good price for the ingredients so I decided to give it a try.The scent: I got citrus vanilla, it smells just like a pack of starburst candy, mainly the pink and yellow ones. I like, it's not a sugary sweet cloying scent but light and not too strong. The scent fills the shower when I use it, but doesn't linger on my skin after I rinse.Lather: Without a shower poof or something similar it pretty much doesn't lather. With just your hands you can get a light bubble but if you will go through a lot of product, with a poof a quarter size drop will get you plenty of thick suds for your entire body.It rinses clean, doesn't leave residue or scent.This is the first body wash I've found that doesn't leave my skin slightly dry or itchy. After rinsing my skin is soft and hydrated. Not enough so I don't need lotion, but enough that I'm not scratching later.Overall I like it and would buy again.Pros: Scent, smells like starburstsHydrating, doesn't leave me itchy (I have eczema)Lathers well with a poof, without you will need a bunch to get a light latherRinses without residue, doesn't leave scent on skinIngredient list is greatCons: You need a lot of product to lather, and the bottle isn't huge",
