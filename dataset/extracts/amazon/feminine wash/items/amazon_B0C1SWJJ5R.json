Usually, I use a gel/liquid, but I was pleasantly surprised with how simple it was to use this foam.With one pump, there is a nice amount of foam, but I personally use two pumps for cleansing. It lathers relatively well, but I would prefer a little more lather than it provides. It is soft and nonirritating on my skin and after rinsing, I do feel fresh and clean. It seems to keep bacterial smells at bay as well throughout the day.I don\u2019t really like the scent, however. For the most part, it has very little smell to it. But there is a slight glue scent that comes from it while cleansing. After rinsing, it seems to go away, but I don\u2019t really enjoy the smell while I\u2019m using it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very nice feminine wash. I like the idea that it's paraben-free, and contains some natural ingredients aimed at reducing inflammation and calming irritation. This was important to me, as I have a history of reacting badly to some products, and I'm very careful with what I'll put on my skin these days.The bottle's pump action works very smoothly and dispenses a light foam. It's unscented, works well, and rinses off well, without any residual stickiness or greasiness. I've been impressed (and relieved) to find that I've been able to use this intimate wash daily in the shower, and I've had no irritation or adverse effects from it.The price is perhaps a little on the high side, but this is a good product, and I'd trust it much more than some of the cheaper, highly-scented feminine washes on the market. Happy to give this one a 5-star review.",

On the other hand I must say I use 2 different washes for my face ( one for face one for eye makeup) and the other night I accidentally pumped some of this instead of my eye makeup remover that I also have in a pump. Since I already had some on my hand I decided just to use it on my eyes anyways I didn't want to waste it. It worked great !!lol . I guess since it's for sensitive parts it had no harsh ingredients so my eyes did not get irritated. So multiuse !",

This unscented PH balancing wash is the first thing that really seems to help! It really doesn't have any scent, but everything downstairs feels fresh, it's not irritating (even when some of it accidentally got... inside... it's intended for external use but it's nice to know that it didn't cause any problems internally either!), and I haven't had nearly the odor issues that I usually have when I'm hot and sweaty. I've been using it twice a week and very happy with it!",
