I use so little each shower that big bottles always bother me - they take up lots of room and are there for months. I really like the size of these, and while they will each last a while, it won\u2019t be invading my shower for a year.The scent is rather nice. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call this strawberry, but I don\u2019t really have another idea of what it smells like. Whatever it is, it is pleasant and after it is rinsed off, the scent is more subtle. I have not had any issues with sensitivity to this product. It definitely gives me a fresh feeling though - almost like a cooling feel to it. And, I don\u2019t notice any odor or any issues during the day after use.",

I was afraid that the eucalyptus would make it smell more like a medicinal soap, but it\u2019s more minty and refreshing than I expected. It\u2019s something I would definitely use if I was sick or during the winter months, but it does smell a bit too similar to a vapor rub to really scream \u201cdesire\u201d. It has a very nice cooling effect that leaves you feeling clean and I noticed less body odor.",

It also has a heavy perfume smell, but not a nice one\u2014more like a grandma visiting a hospital kind of smell.",
