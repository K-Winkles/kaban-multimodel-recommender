However my lady parts have found a solution! The ingredients aren't just listed in the bottle you can actually feel the difference. The tea tree smell isn't over powering yet it creates a nice clean feeling. The moisturizers create a silky feeling that last long after the shower and to out it lightly maybe a little too long after because my evening was \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 my husband can attest to that. All in all I have zero complaints I used it for several days before writing my review just to ensure my experience wasn\u2019t an anomaly. I\u2019m pleased to say it isn\u2019t! So if there\u2019s a lack of availability then blame me because when I find something great I like to stock up just in case. I\u2019m 40 and a mother of 3! So if you are still debating then there\u2019s your sign! Thank me later ciao!",

I\u2019m very familiar with how good boric acid and tea tree oil are even on your most sensitive parts and I\u2019m not gonna lie this summer humidity has me all sweaty and not smelling so sweet. I found this and decided to give it ago. This stuff works great! There is definitely been a noticeable difference even the day after use. It\u2019s not like a cover the smells with perfume it\u2019s literally the lack of any scent that is perfect! It also leaves a cooling clean feeling. Will buy again.",

                "reviewText": "The scent is pleasant but it's a bit too mild for my liking. Any type of body wash/soap that I buy, I prefer to have something with a good amount of fragrance. I don't want something overpowering, but I want something that I can definitely enjoy the aroma of.The consistency of the product is good, and it's not runny or watery. I was a little disappointed with the amount of lather, though. It didn't provide as much lather as the body wash I typically use, but overall it does what it's supposed to as far as cleansing and freshening the skin.A couple of positive attributes are that it's cruelty free and made in the USA with no artificial dyes or colors.",

This has been perfect so far. The scent is perfect, the effectiveness of the wash is perfect and it\u2019s even in a very easily useable bottle. I love that it\u2019s organic, paraben and sulfate free! I also love that it has no dyes and is cruelty free, which is very important to me I have recommended this to friends and family and will continue to purchase myself.",
